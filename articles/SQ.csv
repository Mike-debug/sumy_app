I wonder if the opposite also holds true because that is what Square (SQ) has been doing over the past few months. Back in March, the company was left for dead. More than 30% of Square-powered small businesses were forced to close, and the stock tumbled to almost $30 per share. It almost made sense at the time, with the main revenue-generating business line blowing up in the air. And yet, Square managed to pivot its business around, change shape, and start rolling as fast and as far as few thought it was possible.Square was basically left with only Cash App, a single application on the app store, to support a multi-billion dollar company. Back in April, I stressed the importance of looking beyond COVID-19, and that the fight was not lost. I was right, and I was wrong. The Cash App business exploded thanks to the pandemic (leading to a 200% gross profit growth year over year), but I did not expect such growth to happen as early as Q2. Overall, the company achieved a 242% revenue increase YoY in Q2, and from here, more than a square this company looks like a fast-rolling sphere. Looking at the Q2 results, you can quickly spot that the $875 million in bitcoin revenue made all the difference over last year’s result.Figure 1Source: Square Q2 Earnings FilingSquare makes barely any profit on Bitcoin revenue line, but if you take that as “worthless revenue,” you are looking at it from quite a bad angle. All the bitcoin revenue comes from Cash App users, and the possibility of buying and selling bitcoin on the app is only one of the several features that are contributing to the success and stickiness of the company’s app. Cash App is now used by more than 30 million customers, with 7 million monthly active Cash Card customers. Due to the network effects underlying the app, it’s spreading like a weed and it gets stickier and stickier the more people start using it. Looking at the app trends in terms of downloads, the future looks bright, and Cash App growth is not slowing down. The app has been the number one most downloaded Finance apps on the store for months and months, and it is ranked fifth in the overall (all-apps) downloads rankings. Have you ever seen a financial app spread so much, so fast? I don't think so. And if you thought most of the growth is behind us, the download chart below is showing otherwise. Cash App hit the third spot in the most downloaded app on the Android store at the end of August, achieving even further acceleration in September.Figure 2Source: App Annie IntelligenceSquare’s opportunity with Cash App is still substantial. The app is particularly attractive to the unbanked and the underbanked households, and the numbers there remain appealing. According to a 2017 survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., twenty-five percent of U.S. households are unbanked or underbanked. Cash App is filling the gap in that market, and on top of that is spreading fast between young adults and millennials from all backgrounds.With Cash App momentum running hot, the recovery of Square's main business could also provide an extra push in the coming months. Gross Processing Volume (GPV) was down 15% year over year last quarter. There is still blood in the waters, but the trend is positive with GPV improving each month from April to July. Honestly, I don’t think this is a trend we can rely on in the short term, as the second/third/fourth wave of the coronavirus could always put an abrupt stop to this trend.About the competition, main competitor PayPal (PYPL) is growing hand-in-hand with Square in the digital wallets and digital payments industry. While PayPal is an established leader in the latter, Square is rapidly gaining momentum in the digital wallets industry and significantly outpacing PayPal’s users' growth (Figure 2). However, PayPal's recent strong bet on cryptocurrency is something to look out for. I don't believe it's enough to move the needle, but it will certainly attract some users to their platform. On the other hand, Square's merchant-oriented business is insinuated by JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) QuickAccept. Differently from the digital wallets market, this business segment could actually be impacted by competitors entering the field. In fact, the digital wallet segment becomes an impenetrable fortress the more it can leverage the established ecosystem to continuously reinforce itself. However, merchants vote with their wallet first and foremost. JPMorgan wants to compete on price, and it is offering features (i.e. fast funding) for free, unlike Square's 1.5% fee. Despite Cash App growth, Square's merchant business is still the main revenue stream of the company. Should the competition start a price war, the race to the bottom could significantly affect the business's line margins.Square’s momentum is still rolling. The company’s metamorphosis is eliminating most of the friction it was supposed to face, on paper, back in March. Square is emerging as the leader in the digital wallet industry, a sector that is set to gain increased relevance over the long term. The company is rolling fast, gaining momentum, and those focusing on the bitcoin’s revenue being worthless can’t see the forest for the trees. Competition is heating up, on one hand validating Square's vision (i.e. PayPal and digital currencies), and on the other competing on price rather than value, implicitly validating Square's superior product.Thinking about the company with a long-term time horizon, I remain very bullish on Square. Despite the recent pullback, I think long-term investors are better off holding tight to their shares.If you found this article of value and want to receive updates on this research, just click the ""Follow"" button near the title."
4385243,105176,2020-11-05T11:06:51-05:00,"Talks are ongoing regarding Square potentially purchasing Credit Karma's tax preparation business.Tax filing is deliberately difficult and expensive, presenting a great pain-point for Square to simplify.I see tax preparation to be a great add-on to Square's seller ecosystem and Cash App.Square's ability to gather user and business data will increase tremendously with tax preparation and cross-selling opportunities could unfold.","From its inception, I have seen every service offering from Square (SQ) to be a solution to a major pain-point for merchants. Starting with the revolutionary magnetic card reader in 2010, which marked the beginning of their journey, the company perfected the point-of-sale system simplifying the troubles at the checkout counter.To provide liquidity to merchants at times of difficulty, Square launched Square Capital in 2014. Square's tight integration with merchant cash flow systems gives Square all the data they need to make customized short-term loan offers to its merchants.In 2015, Square began reducing small-business headaches of managing payroll, issuing tax forms and taking care of employee benefits.In 2017, Square helped businesses go online through the integration of Weebly, into the seller ecosystem. Square then went ahead and acquired Weebly in 2018.Image Source: Author's creation with images from Getty Images, debanked.com and Squareup.com)In parallel, Square also provided much needed simplicity to individuals to take care of their finances. With Cash App (introduced in 2015), Square gave convenience, simplicity and flexibility to users. One can now manage their personal finance entirely with Cash App, since it allows direct deposits and withdrawals using a debit card (Bank Account replaced), it allows commission free investing in US securities (brokerage account replaced) and Bitcoin.Now, we hear about Square potentially buying Credit Karma's tax preparation unit and I think it's a great addition to Square's suite of offerings for reasons described in the sections below.An audit report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration in early 2020 pointed out that a very small fraction of individuals who are eligible to file taxes for free, actually used the service.Data Source: Complexity and Insufficient Oversight of the Free File Program Result in Low Taxpayer Participation Audit report from TREASURY INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR TAX ADMINISTRATIONThe report alleges that Free File Inc.'s members deliberately hid the free option from taxpayers through dark pattern tactics that are better described in this page from propublica.orgData Source: Complexity and Insufficient Oversight of the Free File Program Result in Low Taxpayer Participation Audit report from TREASURY INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR TAX ADMINISTRATIONDIY software is actively displacing accountants for many US tax-filers and Square can help speed up that transition.Image Source: Getty ImagesIntuit (INTU), which owns TurboTax (one of the services highlighted in the audit report to have used dark pattern tactics to hide the FFI option from taxpayers), is attempting to acquire Credit Karma for $7.1 billion. This deal now has an antitrust probe by the Department of Justice since it reduces competition in the tax preparation business. As a result, Credit Karma is finding a buyer for its tax prep business.Does Credit Karma's tax prep also use tactics to unfairly push taxpayers to a paid option? I doubt it, since Credit Karma's tax prep segment doesn't actually have a paid option.Image Source: Credit Karma WebsiteA service that helps you file taxes has full visibility into:These data points hold tremendous value in the financial services industry. Credit Karma already provides tailored offers for credit cards and loans, with data from tax returns. Square is seen as a potential buyer for Credit Karma's tax preparation business and I see it as a meaningful tuck-in acquisition for Square.Square can directly provide the tax preparation support to its seller ecosystem for a fee. This can simplify the business tax filing process which is a major pain point for many small businesses, according to a 2018 survey by the National Small Business Association. I think this data is still very relevant since nothing much has changed in the tax filing process since 2018.Image Source: NSBA SurveySquare CEO Jack Dorsey is a great problem solver and is highly skilled in identifying efficient solutions to some of the most challenging problems in the world. With tax filing as a major pain point for so many business owners, I see this potential acquisition as a suitable fit to Square's existing business.I see the tax prep service as a bridge between the seller ecosystem and Cash App. Square could offer tax preparation services to individuals and obtain more information about their financial posture, to attempt to provide offers (through Cash Boost or other similar methods). I can also visualize tax filing incentives for Cash App users.Earlier in 2020, Square received FDIC approval to launch a bank charter. The approval requires Square to launch the bank within 12 months, so I expect more details about the bank and its offerings to be announced soon.I think the tax preparation business can provide a lot of data to drive operations for the bank and its inclination to focus on small business loans.In my previous article about the company - Square: A Tech Company and A Bank, I described the interconnectedness of Square's offerings through the diagram below.Source: Modified by the authorConsidering how Square assists sellers with payroll and point-of-sale, Tax preparation is a great fit in this ecosystem. For individuals, with digital receipts and billing services, along with Cash App's investment capabilities, tax preparation would be a great value add for users.The seller ecosystem opportunity exceeds a TAM of $100 billion and Square reportedly has penetrated less than 3%.Image SourceWith JPMorgan (JPM) announcing a smartphone card reader and faster access to funds, a lot of Square bulls may be afraid of the competition. In my opinion, JPMorgan is a traditional bank that lacks innovativeness, and often plays catch-up once they see the lucrativeness and trendiness of a service in the financial services space. They previously attempted a digital wallet to take on Apple (AAPL) and Samsung and had to retire the service due to lack of adoption.Also, I still see the commission-free trading platform, Robinhood, to be strong and growing despite JPM's commission free ""You Invest"" which barely moved the needle since 2018. I see Square as a technology company that attempts to solve problems in the financial services space, while JPMorgan as a financial services company that could have solved these problems decades ago, but just realized how it could be done, while maintaining profitability. My intention with these mentions is to only show how JPMorgan isn't necessarily a threat to Square at this time. I don't have any position or a view on JPM as an investment opportunity at this time.While I recognize that the seller ecosystem has competition from several players, I believe Square's service offerings are wide and provide a one-stop-shop to customers. The addition of the tax preparation service only widens the offering further.With Credit Karma's pending $7.1 billion sale to Intuit, I think the tax preparation business will be worth a very small fraction of the price (<10% perhaps, but I do not have the data to support my estimate). Square's balance sheet had $2.7 Billion in cash and short-term investments (as of June 30, 2020) and only $44 million in short-term debt. I think Square has sufficient liquidity to perform the acquisition without hurting the shareholders.The news about the possible Credit Karma acquisition, Jack Dorsey's senate hearing regarding Twitter (TWTR) and Quick Accept announcements from JPM has caused the market to panic. Square is ~18% off its recent all-time-highs following all the noise and I think the pullback provides a good entry point.From a valuation perspective, I see Square priced similarly to its close rival PayPal (PYPL) and find 10x sales to be a suitable multiple for a company with growth potential in multiple segments.Source: Seeking AlphaIntuit currently dominates the market share of the tax preparation business, with 55% market share, according to Bloomberg Intelligence Report. With allegations of deliberately pushing taxpayers to use their paid services and profiting from these tactics, I think the tax preparation business is in need for some disruption, to make it easier, more accessible and cost-effective for tax payers.With Square having success stories of disrupting similar problems, that were the moats for big banks and financial services firms, I am inclined to place my bet on them if they enter the tax preparation space. I also think this service sits very well as a bridge to the seller ecosystem and personal finance segments as the opportunities cater to both. I think Square is a great company with tremendous growth potential ahead and should be part of a long-term growth portfolio."
4380641,105893,2020-10-22T14:13:53-04:00,"Square is a diversified financial services firm that focuses on individuals and small to medium sized businesses.Their Cash App ecosystem has benefited from the COVID-19 epidemic, although their Seller ecosystem has struggled.A hard look at their financials shows that Square is extremely overvalued, even with optimistic projections.","Square (SQ) is a good company with a recognizable brand. They offer a diversified list of products and services in the financial services industry. The problem is they face very strong competition from new entrants as well as industry heavyweights which will put pressure on future prospects. Even after assuming generous growth and margin expansion, SQ is extremely overvalued. I have a 12-month price target of $79.65.SQ is a financial services company that provides mobile payment processing and point of sale solutions for small to medium size businesses. They provide eCommerce tools to help businesses build an online presence. Additionally, individuals can use SQs Cash App for peer-to-peer payments, direct deposits, brokerage services, bitcoin investing, and as a Cash Card for spending. They have been approved by regulator to open a bank, which they plan to do in 2021.SQ was founded in 2009 as a mobile payment processor. Since going public in 2015 it has struggled to become profitable. 2019 was its first year without a loss, but that was due to the sale of its food ordering business Caviar. The company is experiencing slowing revenue growth and tight margins, making the path to profitability unclear. In fact, a closer look at their last quarterly statement shows that year over year revenues were flat after adjusting for bitcoin. I believe it is prudent to remove bitcoin revenues and costs from all calculations, since they provide no value and actually increase risk. While some of the slowdown in revenue growth can be attributed to COVID-19, this growth was already trending downwards, and the epidemic has actually helped the strong Cash App growth. Even after accounting for a large bounce back in its Seller ecosystem growth, the company is extremely overvalued by most metrics.The main driver of a share price pullback in SQ are its fundamentals. Investors are currently pricing in exponential growth and increasing margins, but an analysis of its financial statements and a comparison to competitors shows that these expectations are unrealistic. Additionally, more competition is entering the space which will provide further pressure on their future growth.SQ is currently being valued like a high growth tech company but lacks the fundamentals to achieve this valuation. Its growth has slowed, and it has not achieved improving margins with scale. In the last few years, operating costs have grown in tandem with revenues leaving operating margins flat. My DCF analysis uses a WACC of 12.6% as the discount rate, and the current risk-free rate of 0.698% as the terminal growth rate. The analysis uses adjusted numbers, removing bitcoin revenues and costs from when they first appear in the financials in 2018, through all my projections. From 2018 to 2019 adjusted revenue growth slowed from 41% to 34%. An analysis of their most recent 10-Q shows as of June 30, 2020, 3-month ended year-over-year revenue growth declined 0.1%. The 6-month ended year over year revenue growth was 9.27%. Again, these are all adjusted for bitcoin. Obviously COVID-19 played a big role in the Q2 slowdown, so I have accounted for this by applying a generous 30% revenue growth rate for Q3 and 40% for Q4, implying a strong bounce back as businesses slowly reopen. These expectations have to be tempered by the fact that some of these small and medium sized businesses are never coming back.I continue my optimistic projections as the move to a cashless society is accelerated, providing continued growth for the Cash App ecosystem. As more businesses are drawn to SQs Seller ecosystem, both of its segments experience strong growth. From 2021-2024, revenue growth rates are 50%, 45%, %40, and 35%. I also assume that as the company grows, it benefits from improving margins due to scale and network effects. These are generous assumptions considering they haven’t been able to accomplish this yet. Their operating margins improve gradually from 1% in 2019 to 27% in 2024. Their profit margins improve from 9% in 2019 to 24% in 2024. It’s important to note that profit margins were -1% in 2018, and the jump in 2019 should be attributed to the sale of their food ordering business Caviar.Even after assuming strong growth and improving margins, my forecast shows SQ trading at rich multiples. With my projections, its 2021 multiples are a P/S of 11.55, P/E of 89.08, and P/FCF of 65.75. Its EV multiples project to be an EV/S of 10.41, EV/EBITDA of 67.70, and EV/FCF of 59.25. Comparing these multiples to competitors helps illustrate the issues with the current valuation. SQ provides multiple services so no single comparison will be exact. However, we can look at all the comparisons and then get an overall view.Source: Company data, EDGAR database, author estimatesSource: All charts made using Yahoo Finance, Excel, and author estimates.As the charts illustrate, SQs P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples greatly exceed their competitors. For P/S and EV/S, only the two financial giants Visa(V) and Mastercard (MA) have more stretched multiples.SQ already faces competition in all of its lines of business, and more competitors are entering. Current competitors include Paypal (PYPL), Fiserv (FISV), Stripe, Visa, and Mastercard to name a few. Additionally, more competition is entering the space which will provide further pressure on their bottom line. JP Morgan (JPM) has introduced its new QuickAccept service that allows businesses to take card payments through a mobile app or contactless card reader. Unlike SQ, users will see the funds in their accounts the same day for free. SQ takes at least a day or charges a fee of 1.5% to make the transfer instant. Visa is expanding its tap to phone for contactless transactions, allowing merchants to turn their Android devices into POS terminals. PayPal is allowing customers to buy and sell cryptocurrency directly from their accounts. They plan to make crypto available as a source of funding for purchases at their merchants. All of this competition is going to put pressure on SQs growth and margins.My DCF model uses many assumptions to come to a valuation and there is always a risk that the estimates are wrong. If revenue growth and margin expansion are stronger than my estimates, the actual share price could be much higher than my target.It’s also possible that I have undervalued the network effects of the entire SQ ecosystem. If more businesses and individuals are drawn to the diversity of SQs offerings, this could have a positive impact on the business.I may be underestimating the effects of SQs bank on their business and future growth. That being said, I must factor in the increased regulatory scrutiny, capital requirements, and risks that come with being a bank.Square is a good company in a growing space but its share price has gotten way ahead of its fundamentals. Competition is strong and only getting started. I see a lot of downside risk ending in a greater than 50% price drop."
4381612,102226,2020-10-27T10:22:27-04:00,"Square is an impressive business and a very expensive stock.The valuation leaves little room for error.The business changes growth engines every few years. Cash App, the current engine, is stunning. But it will slow.Seller ecosystem will find more competition as client size grows.Street analysts are bullish. Time to go against and lighten up holdings.","Square (SQ) carries the dreams of many investors who see it as 'the future' of commodity financial services in the retail mid-corporate markets.No question, the company has achieved great things technologically, as well as rapid top line growth since being founded in 2009.After strong performance in the stock this year, it is expensive. With its main Seller engine under COVID-19 pressure, SQ needs to feed hungry bulls with spectacular second engine Cash App growth to keep levitating at around 10x the multiple of operating revenue that established banks trade on.Investors should look to lighten up if invested, and avoid starting a position for now if not invested.SQ is up 200% over the last year, outperforming fintech vehicles such as the ARK Fintech ETF by a good margin. This is a massive short-term outperformance and reflects Cash App's stimulus beneficiary status (Sellers, as we will see, has been subdued by the pandemic).Source: Bloomberg21 out of 40 analysts in the CNN Business Survey maintain a Buy recommendation on Square. There is only one Underperform in the sample.Bulls are trying to run even faster than the market. Neutrals are hanging onto the rope, wondering when to let go.Source: CNN BusinessIf you take some healthy profit here, you are going against the pack.There are three elements to the storming performance of tech and the likes of SQ this year.If you got this right after the March dip, well done. It is harder from here.SQ is expensive, but is growing their business volumes very quickly.Although bulls of Square will compare its price/sales to its peers and perhaps find a relative edge, this isn't really the point for most investors who read Seeking Alpha, who largely care about absolute returns.How much will parsing elevated price/sales help you if general downside might be substantial?From an absolute return point of view what matters is this: SQ is only likely to maintain its current valuation if the growth story keeps rolling: innovation, customer acquisition, and gross profit expansion.Because, at the end of the day, SQ is in the business of commodity financial services, and mature stocks in that business trade at relatively modest multiples due to cyclicality, low growth, and commodity product status.To get a sense of what SQ needs to do to keep satisfying its growth-hungry, growth-dependent, bulls, let's take a look at two of the major growth shifts that have already taken place in SQ.Until 2016, SQ was a payments aggregator offering a number of auxiliary services to its previously underserved small business clients base, or 'sellers', in SQ's parlance. This is a cross-sale model that has some novel features, but which anyone who has analyzed payments firms and SME and retail banking will be familiar with.Source: Company PresentationSQ was responsible for creating a payment facility that allowed anyone with a mobile device to accept a card payment without the usual merchant account with an acquiring bank.So far, it has fought off competition well. But for the last five years, its main growth in Sellers (its merchant segment, which for a long time dominated its business mix) has seen a big mix shift toward larger clients.The impact of larger clients has transformed the mix of Gross Payment Volume (GPV) for SQ Sellers. Take a look at this chart:Source: Company Data, Author ExcelAnd within this change in share, larger-client GPV has grown pretty aggressively since 2015.Source: Company PresentationOK, so the key to Sellers is:The chart below shows how new sellers contribute recurring revenue streams that also show some growth after the year in which they start using Square. It is difficult to measure precisely from the chart, but it's clear from eyeballing it that cohort growth moderates after the first full year or two.Source: Company PresentationThis means new sellers are key to SQ's growth, rather than wider take-up of SQ products and expanding use of the Seller ecosystem from existing sellers after an initial expansion across the ecosystem. That take up of the wider product suite is a useful boost, to be sure, but it isn't the central driver.From here, the issue will be competition.Currently, SQ is active in serving the lower half of the segments shown in the following chart. And the next step up will take SQ into the largest slice of the pie, the lower mid market, with companies over $1m to $20m of revenue.Source: Company PresentationThis segment is better served than the micro sellers that SQ built its initial business on, and SQ will face more competition.Competition will mainly take the form of competing service packages rather than pricing. Selling product bundles to mid-market and larger SME clients has long been regarded as a relatively high fee area for conventional banks.Against that restraint, each new customer will bring greater volume than previous cohort averages. At your next lunch with CEO Jack Dorsey, make sure to ask him about his approach to this client tier.Overall, Sellers has seen its growth slow. The most useful chart for this is one ending 2019, which excludes the downturn SQ clients experienced with COVID-19 lockdowns this year.Source: Company PresentationHaving seen Gross Profit in Sellers grow 63% in 2016, SQ posted 29%, less than half this rate of growth, for Sellers in 2019. That's still a powerful growth rate, but the base effects seem obvious in this ecosystem. And while incremental gross profit in Sellers grew 38% in 2018, it only grew 7% in 2019. It may surge again. But the market is looking elsewhere within SQ for the next growth driver.This brings you to the second change of growth engine. Cash App.2. Cash App: from sellers to individualsAs you can see in the chart above, Cash App gross profit has exploded from $5m in 2016 to $458m in 2019. The news was also good at 2Q20, when 30m new users were added.Early Cash App gross profit was largely driven by transaction fees, but now includes credit card interchange, ATM withdrawal and interest earnings on customer balances.Source: Company PresentationCash App is at the forefront of the market's attention, as the main vehicle of SQ's growth. User growth momentum should continue and augment the ""send to spend"" growth already seen. Growth of over 150% through the balance of the year is possible. One risk to this is that stay at home behavior and stimulus money have encouraged sign-ups to Cash App, and that the rate of new users joining may abate. The market is assuming exponential growth and any hiccup will put this outcome into question.While some analysts talk about SQ disintermediating banks, what it is really doing is trying to become one. The company now has a banking license, and we should see the bank take form in 2021.We need to see how large the credit operation becomes. Remember, credit takes capital, and is a highly cyclical business. Although SQ may have an edge in risk scoring due to the real time data it collects from users, the fact is nearly all banks in the US (and globally) have seen very low credit costs in the last cycle and, post-COVID-19, this is likely to continue, given the Fed's intention of letting the economy run hot.Valuation in this business is all about the top line, again. The market is making an assumption that SQ will one day reduce its level of 'growth spend' (But R&D and marketing) and profits will come. That's reasonable. Earnings mix will eventually determine margins. But park that for now.Assume that SQ makes Gross Profit of $2.6bn in 2020, and grows at 40% for the next two years. It would be trading at 30x that number for 2020 (on a market cap/gross profit basis) and 15x 2022. Major banks are trading on 3-3.4x the same number. And the likes of Visa (V) are on about 18x.Looking at potential earnings, for reference, you could assume a net margin of about 30% in a large bank like PNC (NYSE:PNC) or even JPMorgan (JPM) in a normal economy. The same kind of net margin would put SQ on 50x EPS for 2022.As we all know, SQ isn't producing a material net income due to its heavy marketing and product development spend. And the market would expect nothing less. Bulls make a strong point here: when SQ decides, it can cut these expenses, and profit will flow.The problem here is that when SQ decides to normalize its development expenditure, it will be because its extremely rapid growth story is over. The glamor around its growth status will lose its sheen, and its valuation will start to normalize. That could be painful.In a more normal economy, major banks are pretty happy to keep up with nominal GDP growth revenue-wise, say 4%. SQ is growing 8-10x that speed currently, assuming Cash APP doesn't flag. In that respect, I don't find the valuation to be irrational. However, it leaves no room at all for a growth slowdown. Nor does it make the stock seem attractive to jump onto at the current level.SQ's view of its total addressable markets (TAM) is well known.Source: Company PresentationThis slide suggests a lot of runway. It feeds the idea of a fast moving firm chomping down low hanging fruit, which is what SQ has been so far.I have written about a number of large banks on Seeking Alpha recently, arguing there is value in Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C).One source of pushback in the comments to these articles was the view that 'all' business in bank financial services is moving to hybrid payments firms, some of which are building banking elements into their product offerings.Now of course, that isn't going to happen.A modest growth rate in a single large bank will produce the same amount of new revenue as a 40% growth rate does in SQ. That's one bank. So any number of them together simply crush the volumes that are being achieved by SQ and its disruptor peers, despite the rapid rates of growth that the disruptors are expanding by. And we know that every quarter brings an update from every bank on its customers' uptake of digital products, as well as their own tech related hiring and spending.In some ways, bulls of SQ should welcome the fact that its growth story is happening beneath the radar of the mature financial services sector, because it means SQ will not encounter a telling response from major banks, which are well resourced and focused on key tech developments such as blockchain.But Cash App, if it coheres with a banking offering to generate rapidly growing and significant deposit volumes might find itself copied by banks as a means to growing sticky retail deposits, which will always be coveted by the sector.Do you want to speculate or invest?If you want to speculate, then by all means hold onto your SQ position. You've done well, and there is some chance the company will dazzle with Cash App at the 3Q results in early November.For this speculative potential, I would not short SQ right now. Cash App is likely to be strong in the coming results and the bulls will try to drive the stock higher.But if you are investing, then take some profit and re-engage once the downside has been tested. For the following reasons:I will write again about SQ following the 3Q results.If you found this article useful, please consider joining my followers with the button at the top of this article."

This is evidenced by the increase in its share price, up ~16x since its IPO in November 2015.Square is a pure play tech-enabled payments provider with a well-diversified portfolio of offerings, some of which are well positioned to benefit in the current economic climate. With its broad portfolio of products, Square offers investors an opportunity to gain exposure to the entire fintech landscape. Square offers B2B and B2C products, including tech-enabled POS payments, online payments and services, fintech driven loans, payroll, invoices, cash cards and an opportunity to invest in stocks and bitcoins through the app. Square operates across two ecosystems - 1. Seller ecosystem provides SMBs with modern payment processing services and 2. Cash App, a financial mobile app allowing users to store, spend and invest money digitally.Figure 1: With its broad portfolio of products, Square offers investors an opportunity to gain exposure to the entire fintech landscape:Source: Square Unit Economics Presentation March 2020Fig 2: Gross profit for Cash App was 41% of H1 2020, increasing 167% in Q2 as it benefited from Stay at Home measures:Source: Square Q2 2020 earningsSquare has sized its Seller ecosystem TAM opportunity at $85bn in the US, driven by $39bn in transaction profit, $30bn for software, $12bn for Square Capital, and $5bn for other financial services. In the medium term, it sees an additional $16bn in transaction profit in current international markets. Square also noted that it continues to see significant opportunities to serve larger sellers going forward, which may further increase its TAM. According to Square, Seller ecosystem TAM has a diffusion rate of <3% currently, underscoring the long runway of growth for the fintech.Fig 3: US represents an $85bn TAM opportunity for Square's Seller ecosystem:Source: Square March 2020 Unit Economics PresentationSquare quantified Cash App's TAM opportunity at $60bn in March 2020. This was based on the ecosystem being able to attract people age cohorts 15 to 39-year-olds which constitutes 100m people in the US. Since then, management has reported that they have been adding a significant number of new customers over the age of 35. Furthermore, after releasing its TAM figures, Square has made a small acquisition of Verse, a P2P service provider in Spain, which operates across Europe. The TAM is also expected to increase over time as it launches new products in its Cash App ecosystem. Importantly, Cash App's TAM is penetrated <2% currently, highlighting the long runway of growth for the app going forward.Fig 4: Cash App TAM stood at $63bn in March 2020:Source: Square Unit Economics March 2020 presentationThe onset of the virus has seen Seller GPV decrease by 15% YoY in Q2 2020 as SMBs in the US and internationally felt the impact of STH measures. Square outperformed Q2 GPV growth of both GPN and FIS in Q2 2020. Encouragingly, GPV recovered in July, increasing 5% YoY, driven by:We flesh out the above drivers in more detail below.Fig 5: Seller GPV up 5% in July Fig6: US Vol up 8% YoY in Jul & Aug:Source: Square Q2 2020 earnings transcript and AlphaTech Equities Source: Visa 1st Sep 8-KE-commerce business now accounts for 25% of total GPVSquare's e-commerce GPV increased 50% YoY in Q2 2020, now accounting for an impressive 25% of total GPV. Even before the pandemic, Square recorded e-commerce volume growth of over 50% YoY. Square's strategy of building an ecosystem of tools that work right out of the box has been imperative in driving success during the virus. Square's e-commerce checkout has allowed businesses to transition online without having to build a website. One in three of e-commerce businesses onboarded by the company in Q2 2020 was completely new to Square's ecosystem which has only increased further in July. Square's ability to provide a suite of relevant services such as on-demand delivery, allowing its sellers access to third party delivery apps, has also been instrumental in driving incremental online sales during the pandemic.Fig 7: E-commerce now constitutes more 25% of total GPV for Square and continued to grow 50% YoY in Q2 as seen before the virus:Source: Square Q2 2020 Shareholders letterEasing of lockdown measures in the US to see recovery in Seller GPVWhile card present volumes decreased 38% YoY in Q2, Square reported that it saw significant improvement sequentially in volumes each month as lockdown measures continued to ease across the US. Both the US Manufacturing and the Services PMI index have improved significantly over the past few months, which will drive a gradual recovery for Square's card present volumes.Fig 8: US Manufacturing PMI and Services index has recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels:Source: IHS MarkitPPP loans have been a short-term boost for SquareIn Q2 2020, Square extended $873m in total PPP loans across 80,000 small businesses. This equates to 38% of its total 2019 loan volume. 60% of PPP borrowers were new to the Square platform, allowing it to add awareness to a new underserved customer segment. Square also benefited from reversing loan losses it took in Q1 2020 as government stimulus and PPP programs blunted the impact from STH regs.Fig 9/10: In six weeks of Q2, Square extended 38% of total 2019 loan volume; Square's contactless POS has been a key driver of customer acquisitions during the pandemic:During Q2, Square launched promotional pricing on its contactless POS offerings, which include the Square Register, Reader and Terminal. The new pricing contributed strongly in increasing customer acquisitions. Visa (NYSE:V) reported a 150% YoY growth in contactless cards in March, highlighting the importance of the new promotional offering in contactless products to drive growth during the pandemic in Square's Seller ecosystem.Customer Acquisition: In Q2 2020, Square saw number of Cash App users increase 25% in H1 20 and ~100% since the end of 2018 to 30m monthly users. For July, even though management did not disclose a number, Square added the highest number of new active users for any month to date. Furthermore, Square announced incremental opex (mostly selling and marketing) of $100m in Q3 2020 (equating to 16% Q2 2020 opex), aiming to deploy creative marketing strategies to increase its reach to new customers and engage existing users. Square has made good use of the viral nature of P2P transactions where it has been able to add additional users at a fraction of a cost versus other fintechs. Once the customer sign-ups to receive P2P payments from an existing Cash App user, they then become part of the Cash App platform from which they are graduated to use higher revenue products such as cash cards and investing in stocks and bitcoin. Given the importance of P2P payments and keeping to its strategy of international expansion, Square announced the acquisition of Spanish based P2P app Verse in the region of €30 to €50m. Verse operates across multiple European countries. Starting out as a P2P app, Verse now has many of the same features as Square with a debit card and expense tracker for users. The acquisition allows Square to acquire new users and expand much quicker in Europe.Fig 11: Monthly active users have increased 100% since 2018:Source: Square Unit Economics presentation and Q2 2020 transcriptProduct adoption: Cross-selling products at low incremental costs remains a key driver of growth and profitability for Cash App. Transactions per user increased to 15/month, which was up ~50% YoY. In Q2, new customer cohorts had higher attach rates to higher revenue products beyond P2P, such as Cash Card, Boost, Direct Deposit, and Bitcoin investing.Fig 12: Monthly active transactions increased 50% YoY as Cash App continues to diversify its revenue base:Source: Square Unit Economics presentationVolume per active customer: Annual Revenue per customer increased to $45, which is up 50% from the end of 2019 and almost 3x from 2017. The ability of Square to upsell new products and command an increasing share of the wallet has fueled higher lifetime value per customer. Customers who tend to adopt two or more of Square's products saw 2 to 3x the revenue vs customers who use its P2P product only.Fig 13: Revenue per user increased 50% since the end of 2019:Source: Square Unit Economics presentation and Q2 2020 transcriptSimilar to its Seller ecosystem, Cash App has a strong track record of achieving payback within 12 months of acquiring a new cohort. Historically, within three years, total return for new customer cohorts added to Cash App has been over 3x its acquisition spend. More importantly, and as a signpost of future profitability, ROI for new cohorts added in 2017 was 5x the acquisition spend within 2.5 years (see figure below). The ability to add new customers through the P2P platform and graduate them to use more profitable products such as cash cards and investing in shares/bitcoin has seen average revenue per user (ARPU) increase 3x to $45 per user. Going forward, Square's profitability will be driven by its ability to continue to add new customer cohorts and increase engagement of existing customers by increasing transaction activity and adding new value-added products. Fig 14: Square saw profit exceed acquisition spend within 12 months with ROI on acquisition spend >5x within 2.5 years:Source: Square Unit Economics presentationCash card has been a key driver of profitability for Cash App with unit economics far more favorable versus that of a P2P product. At the end of Q2 2020, there were 7m cash card users, which grew 100% YoY with one in four Cash App users now using a card. Cash card users use their cards to spend an average of five times per week. Importantly, cash card has been resilient in Q2 2020, with volumes increasing 50% YoY in a backdrop of US card volumes declining 8%. Growth in cash volumes was driven by an increase in cash card users and spend per user.Fig 15/16: Promoting users to cash card drives significant uplift in profitability; one in four Cash App users now uses a cash card:Source: Square Unit Economics presentationCash card customers spend two to three times more than other cohorts. To increase the penetration of cash cards, Square has worked hard recently to increase awareness of cash cards by bringing it up on user interfaces, making it easier for users to plug the app into their payroll or tax refund systems.In Q2 2020, Square saw funds deposited by direct deposit customers increase by 86% QoQ to $1.7bn. Direct deposit remains a priority for Cash App as these customers are the most engaged cohort, operating larger cash balances and using multiple higher revenue products. At the end of Q1, Square had 14m direct deposit customers.Whilst some investors have been impressed by the growth in Bitcoin, it is important to note that Bitcoin remains a small component (2.6% of adjusted Q2 2020 Rev) of Square's overall business, which is why almost no time was dedicated to Bitcoin by management in its Q2 earnings call. Square highlighted that its Cash App business benefited from Stay at Home measures as users pulled in their stimulus money into the app to invest in stocks and bitcoins. We see strong growth in Bitcoin but expect it to remain a small driver of overall growth for Square going forward.Fig 17: Adj. Bitcoin Rev growth is impressive but accounted for only 2.6% of Square's Q2 adj Rev:Source: Square Q2 2020 results and AlphaTech EquitiesGovernment stimulus has been a key driver in Q2 2020. Square's Cash App has benefited significantly from government stimulus through direct deposits of $1,200 per adult plus $500 per child below the age of 17. With customers having additional funds at their disposal through the stimulus, they have pulled more funds in the Cash App, fueling increased engagement as they use P2P and cash card to spend money and invest in stocks and bitcoin. Encouragingly, new customer cohorts added in Q2 2020 have had a higher engagement. Further stimulus measures are hotly debated in the Congress and, if passed, will give Square a further boost in Q4 2020. However, with no further stimulus measures according to management, Square's expected 200% increase in profitability it saw in July will most be impacted - which we expect will decline to its pre-COVID-19 levels of 100% growth.Reinstating stay at home measures could hamper SMB business. If stay at home measures are re-imposed in a significant number of states across the US, seller GPV will most likely decrease in the low double-digit range. After recent new lockdown measures announced across Europe, we are closely monitoring this risk, but do not expect a steeper second wave in the US in our model.Square reported organic adjusted revenue CAGR of 44% from 2016 to 2019, driven by the ongoing penetration of its integrated payment services and the monetization of its Cash App business. Despite the onset of the virus and the challenging economic backdrop, Square reported adj. revenue growth of 30% in Q2 2020, driven primarily by outperformance in its Cash App business as it benefited from government stimulus and Stay at Home measures.We conservatively forecast adj. revenue growth of 27% over the next 12 months, driven by the reopening of the US economy, continued growth in its e-commerce business, and ongoing outperformance of its Cash App business. We see Square continuing to invest heavily over the next 12-36 months to acquire new Cash App users and graduate users to use more value-added and higher revenue spending products such as cash card and investing products in stocks and bitcoin.Fig 18: We forecast forward 12 months revenue growth to be driven by the reopening of US economy:Source: Square Q2 2020 Financials and AlphaTech EquitiesSquare Financial Model - AlphaTech Equities:Source: Square Financials and AlphaTech EquitiesOver the past three years, Square has traded in the EV/12-month forward Rev range of 10-22x, and over the past 18 months prior to the virus, shares traded in the range of 10-16x. We see 16x EV/Rev as fair, given Square falls in group that largely benefits from Stay at Home measures. Based on 12-month forward Revenue excl. bitcoin, we arrive at an EV of $80bn for Square. We assume a 20x EV/Rev multiple for Square's bitcoin business, given its triple-digit growth imputing an EV of $1.7bn. Adjusting for debt and other items, we get a fair equity value of $82bn or $188 per share, imputing an upside of 19% over its current share price of $158. We initiate coverage on Square with a Buy recommendation.Fig 19: Based on a 16x EV/Rev multiple, we arrive at an upside of 19% for Square:Source: AlphaTech Equities; note that all numbers are in USD m except per share data and multiplesWe see Square's current share price as a good entry point for long-term investors who want exposure to a winner in the fast growing fintech sector with a strong track record of outperformance. Square is pure play tech-enabled payments provider with a large TAM and an unpenetrated market. It has proven to be resilient during the crisis as its Cash App business benefited from STH measures.Seller ecosystem remains resilient as an increase in e-commerce penetration will help blunt the impact from virus on SMBs. Impressive Cash App growth is set to continue as Square continues to invest in selling and marketing expenses to acquire new users and graduate all customers to more value-added products.Despite shares being up 147% YTD, valuations remain attractive as recovery in Seller ecosystem and growth in its Cash App business are still underappreciated by the market. We initiate coverage on Square with a price target of $188, imputing an upside of 19% and recommend a Buy."
4379783,103711,2020-10-19T13:34:21-04:00,"Square point-of-sale readers and the Cash App have been well received across the nation.
        In spite of the difficult macroenvironment, SQ has churned out impressive top line growth.
        Shares should not be valued on the basis of revenues due to the low margins of Bitcoin revenues.","Square (SQ) is a popular stock for good reason: it has strong growth and an easy to understand growth story. SQ benefits from the shift to cashless payments, as its point-of-sale ecosystem appears to be very popular among both businesses and consumers. At first glance, it appears to trade at a dirt-cheap valuation, but low margin revenues skew the picture. While SQ is indeed a very high-quality business, shares have run far too much ahead of themselves and trade very richly. Caution is advised.SQ is most well known for its square readers which facilitate point of sale (‘POS’) transactions for small businesses across the country. SQ earns a service fee starting at 2.65% of each transaction:(SquareUp)SQ is also well known for its Cash App, which allows for peer to peer payment transactions as well as a debit card for in-person transactions. SQ earns money from interest earned on deposits, service fees on transfers, as well as bank fees from transactions:(CashAppHelp)Together, these two products form the backbone for its ecosystem spanning from payments to financial services:(2020 Presentation)SQ has executed strongly, as it has seen rapid double-digit growth in revenues and gross profits:(2020 Q2 Shareholder Letter)SQ has emerged as a market disruptor in both the point-of-sale and fintech industries, and there is little reason to doubt that its dominance can continue moving forward. In the current market, tech companies with strong stories have been rewarded with generous valuation multiples. Before we decide to buy SQ, we should examine valuation to ensure we are not paying too much for future earnings.At first glance, SQ looks like an outright steal, if you value the stock based on revenues.If we annualize the latest quarter’s results, SQ earns $7.7 billion in annualized revenues. Compared with a market cap of $81.9 billion (based on 440.2 million shares outstanding), shares appear to trade at a price to sales multiple of around 10.6. That’s dirt cheap considering the 64% revenue growth rate.If you’re valuing SQ on the basis of revenues, then you’re using the wrong metric. SQ itself hints that revenue isn’t the right metric, as it makes no mention of revenue in the opening lines of its shareholder letter: “In the second quarter of 2020, we achieved gross profit of $597 million, up 28% year over year. Cash App delivered strong growth, with gross profit up 167% year over year to $281 million. Our Seller ecosystem generated gross profit of $316 million, down 9% year over year.”Not all revenue is created equal. Looking below, we can see that bitcoin gross profits are slim, meaning that we can not value bitcoin revenues like we would a typical software company. Transaction-based revenue also has lower profit margins:(2020 Q2 Shareholder Letter)We can only value SQ on the basis of revenues if all revenues have similar gross profit margins - this isn’t the case. We should instead use gross profits, as SQ itself emphasizes. SQ trades at just around 38 times trailing gross profits. Gross profits are growing at a 28% clip which does not come close to justifying the price to gross profits multiple. Using a 30% estimated forward net margin, my buying range is $68 to $115 per share representing 12.6 to 21 times gross profits, or over 30% lower than current prices. Even assuming that gross profit growth returns to the 40% clip of prior quarters, shares still trade at the upper end of my fair value range. The stock is simply too expensive.SQ’s business segments, namely its POS and Cash App segments, are firing on all cylinders. Investors have every reason to be optimistic for SQ’s forward prospects because the impressive financial growth is backed by a fundamentally strong growth story. Valuation does matter. When valuing SQ on the basis of gross profits instead of revenues, shares appear far too richly valued even with significant revenue growth acceleration. If readers are still interested in investing in SQ, I suggest either waiting for its fundamentals to catch up with its valuation, or even selling a covered call to reduce the investment cost - an out of the money call option expiring in June 2021 is a good bet. SQ has a strong balance sheet with $2.0 billion in cash versus $1.8 billion in long-term debt. SQ is a high-quality company trading at a high-quality valuation. Readers need to determine for themselves if they are comfortable “paying up” for quality."
4373227,104695,2020-09-09T10:00:00-04:00,"Square is a Fintech company which initially specialized in payment processing solutions for smaller businesses in the US.It is establishing a comprehensive commerce ecosystem by integrating value-added services to complement its payment solutions in both physical and online channels.The company has also been incredibly successful in reaching the consumer market with P2P payments and cryptocurrency trading.We forecast Square’s revenue andgross profits to grow 157% and 41% on average over the next 3 years supportedby surging cryptocurrency daily trading volume, rising P2P payments adoptionand e-commerce market growth.","Source: SquareSquare, Inc. (SQ) is one of the fastest growing Fintech companies. Initially specializing as a point-of-sale ('POS') solutions provider and payment processor for small businesses, the company has expanded its services by establishing a comprehensive commerce ecosystem integrating many value-added services to help sellers start, run and grow their businesses. Besides merchants, it is successfully establishing its consumer market reach with the Cash App, targeting a younger user base by offering more convenient and engaging services such as P2P payments and zero-commission trading.Source: SquareIn 2020, the company has started to segment its results based on the Seller and Cash App ecosystem. Excluding bitcoin revenues, the seller ecosystem accounts for the majority or almost three quarters of total revenues. The Cash App accounts for the remaining revenues, but is growing at a faster pace.Source: SquareThe company's seller ecosystem is built upon its core payment processing abilities. With a focus on empowering small businesses, the company has grown its merchant base to over 2 mln, processing $106 bln in transactions or gross payment volume ('GPV') in 2019. It takes a cut on each transaction as transaction-based revenues, its primary source of adjusted revenues and most lucrative with a gross margin of around 40%.Its merchant mix consists of sellers from the food and beverage (26%), retail (17%), beauty and personal care (11%) industry. GPV took a hit as merchants were forced to shut down due to the pandemic. However, the impact has been felt less than feared, with GPV declining only about 15% year on year. The decline was offset by a 50% year on year growth in online GPV as Square assisted merchants to transition to its online channels. As restrictions continue easing and consumer spending starts picking up, we see GPV recovering further.Source: Square, Khaveen InvestmentsHowever, it remains a question if volumes can continue to grow beyond the recovery phase. As seen in the table above, GPV had been on the wane even before the pandemic. Management has factored this to intense competition for larger size merchants by competitors such as Paypal (PYPL). Yet, the company still manages to grow and attract larger merchants, categorized as those with payment volumes of over $125,000, which now makes up 52% of its merchant mix compared with 39% five years ago.We believe the company can continue to grow GPV due to two main drivers:First, with its online strategy, it is seeing remarkable online channel GPV growth of more than 50% YoY. The company is pushing towards the rapidly growing e-commerce market with a range of SaaS solutions besides payment checkout such as the Square Online Store, Invoices, Virtual Terminal and eCommerce API. This has enabled Square to assist its existing physical merchants to adapt online, while acquiring new merchants as well. Digital volumes from online channels now account for 25% of GPV and we see this increasing further with the rise in e-commerce. JP Morgan (JPM) estimates US e-commerce accounts for 8.9% of retail sales, which trails behind China at over 23% of sales, signaling an opportunity for the US e-commerce market to grow further, which would benefit Square's seller ecosystem.Source: SquareBesides e-commerce, the company also has a robust product and services ecosystem for physical sellers. Its strategy is to offer different tiers of services depending on the size of the merchants. The basic tier caters to small retailers and restaurants with basic PoS features. Whereas for larger sellers, the company offers a bundle of additional services including management and analytic software for customer retention such as Payroll, Marketing and Loyalty products. It also provides financing to sellers through Square Capital, which utilizes algorithms to evaluate sellers based on real-time payments data.Overall, Square continues to build and deepen its merchant relationships by upselling, allowing the company to keep sellers dependent on its ecosystem and to grow its top line through subscription and service-based revenues.Launched in 2013, the Cash App is a mobile payment service allowing users to transfer money to one another. It represents Square's success in reaching the consumer market with more than 30 mln monthly active users registering a 60% year on year increase, outpacing fiercest rival Venmo (owned by Paypal).Source: Square, Paypal, Ark Invest, BankrateWhile Paypal has a larger user base with a wider reach across different geographical markets, Cash App's success is attributed to a more robust product portfolio, which complements its core P2P payments services, including:These solutions not only enable the company to keep up user engagement, but it also provides multiple opportunities for monetization which explains the higher run rate.It earns transaction fees from P2P transfers along with subscription and services revenue from the Cash Card, a debit card linked to a user's Cash App balance instead of a bank account as well as through direct deposits. The Cash Card is gaining traction and has grown to 7 mln users, which has doubled from a year ago and have seen impressive quarterly growth of 50% even as most US card spend was down, contributing to subscription and service growth, which has risen 116% year on year in the first half of this year. We believe usage will continue to grow as it is further integrating the card for new users to automatically receive a direct deposits account to be used to receive deposits or pay bills.Another unique aspect of the Cash App is stock and cryptocurrency trading. By offering zero-commission trading on a digital wallet, users have the choice to invest surplus funds without leaving the platform. This feature has resonated well with its younger market reach with trading activity surging on the platform as seen with the rise in bitcoin revenues by 520%.Source: Coin MetricsNo doubt, the bitcoin and to a larger extent, the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile with wild price swings. But volatility has little effect on Square, instead, its growth is driven by surging daily trading activity. According to Coin Metrics, the current daily trading volume of Bitcoin is $4.3 bln. This is eclipsed by other major asset classes such as US equity ($446 bln), bonds ($893 bln) and global FX ($1,987 bln). However, Bitcoin volume is seeing explosive growth and is on track to surpass all major asset classes by 2025, representing an annual growth rate of 247%.To sum it up, two factors that support our expectations for continued growth in Cash App are P2P growth and cryptocurrency activity. While it earns only a thin margin of 1 to 2% on the spread, we believe the trading feature has a greater benefit of attracting users to its Cash App and retaining them with added solutions, which have multiple monetization opportunities.One downside of Square is that it still generates most of its sales within the US, accounting for 95% of total revenues. While the rest of its sales are derived from its international operations in Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan. The company is presented with opportunities to further expand in these markets which has a combined population of 250mln.Source: SquareAlthough facing formidable competition from fintech rivals such as Paypal, Square has managed to consistently build on its customer and seller relationship by innovating and adding value-added products and services to retain and attract users.The company has partnered up with regional banks in these markets to assist it to expand at a faster pace. For example, in Australia, it has a partnership with regional banks including Unity Bank, Southern Cross Credit Union and WAW Credit Union to promote its card readers and digital payment products in their stores and websites to 100,000 potential customers.Also, Square's international fees are slightly higher compared with fees charged in its domestic market. Together with a partnership with Mitsui Sumitomo Bank, the third largest bank in Japan, it charges 3.25% for processing fee which is higher than the 2.5% for US merchants but still lower than competitor Paypal with a 5% fee.Overall, we believe the company has an incredible long-term opportunity to expand in international markets. Although representing only 5% of sales, we believe the company's initial efforts will result in stronger growth in the future. Of course, there is still plenty of room for expansion in the US, but the company has plenty of prospects in the $200 bln global Fintech market.Source: Market Data Forecast, Androit Market ResearchTo value the company, we start by projecting the revenues of each segment based on their services. Starting with the Seller ecosystem, we forecast transaction-based revenues to increase 19.7% on rising US e-commerce market volumes and non-cash retail PoS growth. We believe the company's bundle of PoS software and hardware enables it to continuously grow robustly at 15.1% and 20%, which is in line with industry averages.As for the Cash App ecosystem, we see the company benefitting from increasing consumer adoption of P2P mobile payments apps in the US, which currently stands at an adoption rate of 29%. Our transaction and subscription growth forecast of 66% is based on the assumption that the adoption rate reaches 80%. The main driver for Cash App is bitcoin, which we project will grow 247% annually as daily trading volumes continue to surge despite price volatility.Source: JP Morgan, eMarketer, Grand View Research, Modor Intelligence, Coin Metrics, Khaveen InvestmentsSource: Khaveen InvestmentsWhile its revenue growth may appear to be very impressive, especially with seller revenues, this is due largely to how Square recognizes revenue with bitcoin - it records the entire transaction as revenue which may seem misleading. To acknowledge this, we separated bitcoin revenue to arrive at its adjusted revenue figures and gross profit after deducting estimated cost of sales. As seen below, the company's growth rate is still highly attractive even after netting off bitcoin.Source: Khaveen InvestmentsNow that we have an idea of what the company's growth could look like, we apply a discounted cash flow model to value the company.Source: Khaveen InvestmentsBased on DCF analysis, with an EV/EBITDA of 41.43x (digital payments industry average) and a discount rate of 18.5% (Company WACC), while conservatively estimating revenue growth to taper off from 2024 at an average rate of 20%, the fintech market growth rate, our model shows an upside of 29.91%.Square is built on the principle of an ideal Fintech business model, empowering the underserved by integrating a holistic product and service portfolio designed by leveraging technology to offer a seamless and convenient experience for customers. It is continuously innovating to add value to its seller and Cash App ecosystems which allow it to develop a deeper relationship with its users and build customer retention while at the same, providing multiple avenues of monetization opportunities.While the stock is already up 129% YTD, and there is an increasing divide on whether the company is overvalued, we continue to believe in the long-term potential of the company, benefiting from tailwinds on seller ecosystem with rising e-commerce and contactless payment solutions, not to mention rising P2P payment adoption and surging cryptocurrency trading activity. Additionally, the company has yet to realize its full growth potential in the international market. All in all, we rate the company as a Buy with a target price of $190.18.Note: For more research and analysis of high-quality companies within the global fintech industry, please click the ""Follow"" icon at the top of this page."

The incredibly diverse nature of Square's offerings is largely unrivaled in the Fintech industry.What's more, significant network effects are starting to come into play with the growth of these ecosystems. The utility of Square's services will only increase as more people start to use them. The Cash App will become particularly valuable as its number of users increase. Non-Cash App users, for instance, will be incentivized or even forced to use the platform if a significant number of their friends or acquaintances are already using the platform.Square still has far more room to grow in the booming Fintech space. The company currently estimates the Seller and Cash App addressable markets to be ~$100 billion and ~$60 billion, respectively. Square has penetrated less than 3% of the Seller TAM and less than 2% of the Cash App TAM, which indicates that the company is still in its early growth stage.The Seller ecosystem represents an $85 billion market opportunity in the US, with a $30 billion opportunity coming from software alone. On the other hand, the Cash App ecosystem has $9 trillion in potential addressable volume in the US. Square is well-positioned to take a disproportionate share of this massive market moving forward.While COVID-19 is accelerating the shifts towards a digital economy, it is still presenting major hurdles for Square in the short term. The pandemic has had a particularly large negative impact on small businesses, which is a major contributor to Square's sellers ecosystem. Individuals using the Cash App have also been negatively impacted by the pandemic. The coronavirus-induced downturn continues to negatively impact consumer behavior.Square is also facing considerable competition in an increasingly crowded landscape. Payments giant PayPal (PYPL), in particular, is rivaling Square's market dominance. PayPal's Venmo continues to be a major force in the mobile payments industry and an increasingly large threat to the Cash App. In fact, PayPal recently recorded its best quarter ever largely as a result of Venmo.Square faces stiff competition from the likes of PayPal and Stripe.Source: Square, PayPal, StripeSquare continues to grow at a breakneck pace despite the ongoing pandemic. The company reported a Q2 net revenue of $1.92 billion, which represents 64% Y/Y growth. Even at Square's current market capitalization of $75 billion, the company still has far more room to grow."
4374907,69905,2020-09-17T10:57:09-04:00,"Cash App continues to impress beyond expectations.Seller Ecosystem is not likely to be the biggest driver of the story here, very soon.Square's stock is still undervalued and worth considering, even now, at this valuation.","As I made the case for members of my Marketplace, Deep Value Returns, Square (SQ) is a very fast-growing company that has seen its stock go on a strong run of late.However, realistically, the stock is very likely to slow down at some point soon. Having said that, Square's underlying business is terrific and that makes its stock a highly attractive investment.Indeed, there's just so much potential ahead, that it's difficult to assert a hard valuation to it. What I can declare is that the stock still remains cheaply valued.Having said that, it's not all rosy and there are some aspects to remain wary of here. Even though I'm positively bullish Square's potential, I'll attempt to give you a balanced argument for your consideration.(Source)Source: author's calculationsThe thing that should strike you above is that I've labeled the graph 'adjusted'. That's because of the Caviar sale from last year. This shows the revenue growth for Square excluding that business, but it does include bitcoin revenue.Thus, your first thought is just how sustainable is this sort of revenue growth rate? If bitcoin turns south, this could imply that Square's business model rapidly decelerates? Well, not really, because there's a lot more to Square than just transacting bitcoin revenue.Furthermore, Square was forced by SEC to account for its bitcoin as revenue. However, we should note that Square doesn't make practically anything from bitcoin, because it's also forced to buy and sell bitcoin in the market.Therefore, I believe that a better indicator could be to look at Square's gross profits, as this figure would exclude the costs of managing bitcoin. In Q2 2020, Square's gross profit margins were up 32% y/y.(Source)As a reminder, Square has a legacy segment, Seller Ecosystem is facing intense competition and therefore struggling. Meanwhile, Square's Cash App continues to positively surprise investors. I'll address these in order.Square's Seller Ecosystem is Square's biggest segment, for now.(Source)This is Square's commerce solution for facilitating payments.Square's Seller Ecosystem helps payments transactions in many different ways, from a tap, swipe, dip of a card, as well as card-not-present transaction where payments happen online.As you know, during Q2 the US was in lockdown. With Sellers in the food and drink, as well as beauty and personal care verticals experiencing the greatest slowdowns in volume.This segment's revenues were down 17% y/y, driven by a significant decline in transaction-based revenues, which was also down 17% y/y. From its earnings call, we can see that aside from the 4th of July holiday, Square's Seller Ecosystem is flat from June into July.Put another way, Square's Seller ecosystem is struggling to reignite its growth opportunity. Even though Square points to an increase in Seller GPV (Gross Payment Volume) for the month of July, it also notes that this is mostly from international markets which historically carry lower profit margins.Consequently, if that was all there was to Square's investment potential, I would not be hanging around here and would have exited this position. But what I'm truly attracted to is Square's Cash App potential.(Source)As you can see above, putting aside bitcoin revenue which could go either way in the future, Cash App's revenues are soaring. To illustrate, transaction-based revenues were up hugely, albeit from a low base, while its subscription and services-based revenue was up more than 129% y/y.However, the key to Square is to understand that Square's older legacy, Seller Ecosystem carries attractive margins, but that Square's Cash App is not yet as profitable at the gross profit level. Having said that, Square has minimal intention of maximizing profits this early in its journey.For now, Square's Cash App is on a land grab expedition whilst attempting to gain positive mindshare amongst users. Think of Facebook (FB) and WhatsApp, if a company is able to, it's much better off to gain unprofitable market share in the first instance, rather than maximize profits by targeting a very small pool of customers. The game for Cash App is to gain a huge international scale.Later on, after going viral, it's able to turn its economies of scale towards more profitable growth, for now, the opportunity is too large to embark on maximizing profits.As an aside, that Square's transaction-based revenues truly outshine those of PayPal's Venmo (PYPL), which reported 60% revenue growth rates in July.Back on Square, despite not offering Q3 guidance, Square did note that the month of July continues to positively benefit from government funds related to the stimulus and unemployment benefits.Consequently, even though July's Cash App gross profits were up 200% y/y, investors should not expect this sort of gross profit rate to continue.Thus, while some could instinctively argue that Cash App grew so much faster than PayPal's Venmo partly due to bitcoin revenues, the fact that Square's Cash App gross profits were up 200% fundamentally reflects that Cash App is growing fast irrespective of bitcoin volumes.However, realistically, nobody, even the most bullish dreamer is hoping for those sorts of growth rates to be sustainable over the medium term.The key for investors is that although we don't know just how dramatically Square's Cash App gross profits will slow down, nobody expects those sorts of growth rates to be sustained.However, even if Cash App slows down by more than half, that would still point to more than 50% growth rates, leaving investors with plenty of margin of safety from a post-COVID-19 inevitable slowdown.As I noted in the introduction, despite being a value investor whose job is to attempt to value businesses, it's very difficult for me to assert a valuation to Square's intrinsic value.The reason being that Square's Cash App is growing so fast, that it makes a huge difference just how long it can continue to gain market share, and at what pace.However, even though for now, Square's Cash App gross profits are growing at 200% that is clearly not sustainable. But even when these dramatically slow down over the coming several quarters, it would still be highly likely to be growing at north of 80% for some time, maybe even into the back end of 2021 or possibly 2022.Indeed, comparisons are difficult, but to make the point, let's discuss PayPal again. PayPal has a much strong online presence than Square. What's more, PayPal's profit margins are significantly better too.For example, PayPal's gross profit margins are in the mid 40% range, whereas Square's gross profit margins barely reach 40%.However, PayPal's revenue growth rates are around 22%, whereas Square's gross rates are likely to remain at high 30s% for much longer, if not remaining around 40% -- double PayPal's revenue growth rates.PayPal is priced at just under 10x forward sales, while Square is actually being priced at less than 9x forward sales.Square has two segments, its Seller Ecosystem, and its Cash App.Even though its Seller Ecosystem is Square's biggest segment, making up 53% of gross profits in Q2, this segment is slowing down and is less appealing.Saying that, Square's Cash App is highly likely to become Square's biggest segment by next quarter. At that point, investors will be predominantly focused on Square's Cash App and that story, and less attracted to Square's Seller Ecosystem.Lastly, Square is being priced a full turn cheaper on a forward revenue multiple than PayPal despite growing faster than PayPal."
4371734,102736,2020-08-31T13:34:21-04:00,"The ongoing shift towards electronic payments will continue to create room for multiple players competing in the same space without stealing share from each other.Growth in electronic payments is shifting overseas, and Square has the opportunity to scale its business internationally, as it does not rely on a large sales force to attract clients.Ancillary services are becoming an engine for growth and will help Square improve margins and sustain top-line growth.Even after an impressive run, shares are still fairly valued and worth considering an investment given expected top-line growth and room for margin improvement.","Considering the economic environment, Square (NYSE:SQ) posted a solid second quarter that saw Cash App performing extremely well. Revenues were up 64% YoY, with most of the growth coming from its Bitcoin segment. Excluding Bitcoin, revenues were flat YoY, with a 12% decline in transaction-based revenue and a 38% increase in subscription and service revenue.Data by YChartsDue to the challenging conditions following the COVID-19 outbreak, Square's Gross Payment Volumes (GPVs) saw a 15% decline YoY, but volumes have been gradually improving over the past few months. Moreover, GPV from online channels increased 50% YoY, making up more than 25% of the Seller GPV (online channels are defined as card-not-present payments though Appointments, Virtual Terminal, Invoices, E-Commerce API, In-App Payments SDK, Square Online Store, Square Online Checkout and the eGift Cards portal).In Q2-20, Square reached $597 million in gross profit, up 28% YoY; again, Cash App posted extremely positive results, with Cash App gross profit reaching $281 million, up 167% YoY. On the other hand, the Seller ecosystem, being more affected by the coronavirus outbreak, generated gross profit of $316 million, down 9% YoY. In Q2-20, customers increasingly used Cash App to send, receive and spend money; in June 2020, Cash App reached 30 million monthly active customers and more than 7 million spending on the Cash Card. As the company quickly moved to address new customer needs after the COVID-19 outbreak, management is confident the company is well positioned with both its Services and Cash App ecosystems.Key catalysts include:Key risks include:Square's business model allows the company to reach micro merchants that are mostly unavailable for other acquirers. But, in order to develop sufficient scale, the company needs to move past its micro merchant base, and data is showing Square is just doing that. More than half (52%) of its payment volumes comes from businesses with over $125,000 in annual GPV, and growth in clients above this threshold has meaningfully accelerated over the past few years:Source: Square's Investor Update - March 2020.Since Square's ecosystem is primarily driven by merchant fees (and to a lesser degree by lending), targeting larger businesses could have a significant impact on the company's top and bottom lines. Square's suite offerings, quick onboarding times and simplified pricing will likely allow the company to acquire a large enough portion of merchants above the $125,000 level to scale and reach an attractive return. However, it is important to note that Square's pricing is significantly higher than other competitors, with the company's net revenue as percentage of GPV around double that of Global Payments (GPN).Square is also making significant progress in cross-selling ancillary services like Instant Deposit and Square Capital to its merchant client base and this move will likely have a positive impact on the company's margins in years ahead, highlighting the flexibility and scalability of its business model. Through Square Capital, the company provides customers short-term loans of generally 18-month terms with less than 8-9 month average duration that are usually on top of the payment hierarchy, thus mitigating repayment risk. By constantly monitoring eligibility and loan performance with the aid of machine learning, Square has been able to expand its origination volume while keeping loan loss rates below 4%:Source: Square's Investor Update - March 2020.The payment processing industry is a highly scalable business since once a payment platform is established, there is little incremental costs to increase transaction volumes. Traditional players have left room for new competition and Square was initially introduced to serve micro merchants, which are economically unviable for larger players due to low volumes. The company's business model, which includes rapid client onboarding, POS devices, flat fees and internally developed software solutions, allows Square to retain merchants effectively. Square's position among micro and small merchants has reached a point where the company developed sufficient economies of scale to give it a clear cost advantage over potential entrants.The company was also able to successfully diversify its income streams, with total revenue coming from a mix of transaction-based revenue, subscription & services and hardware:Source: Square's Investor Update - March 2020.Moreover, the company's internally developed software solutions have given it another key advantage: while bigger players often rely on external software providers, Square covers the whole customer relationship process. This was made possible by the initial focus on micro merchants which are inevitably simpler businesses, allowing Square to develop significant barriers to exit. The presence of barriers to exit is demonstrated by Square's ability to keep a positive dollar-based retention while expanding into new customer cohorts, which lead to recurring revenue streams:Source: Square's Investor Update - March 2020.The company estimates a total addressable market of $85bn+ in the U.S. for its Seller ecosystem, with the number reaching $100bn+ including expansion in international markets:Source: Square's Investor Update - March 2020.Square also sees a total addressable market of $60bn+ for its Cash App ecosystem:Source: Square's Investor Update - March 2020.These projections show significant room for expansion, as the company estimates the Seller platform's penetration to be less than 3% of total addressable market, with Cash App penetration standing at <2%.Finally, the scalability of its business model would allow Square to easily expand overseas, as international revenue currently represents only 3% of total revenue as of June 2020.Square started in 2009 with the aim to enable businesses (sellers) to accept card payments. Over the years, the company started to provide a wide plethora of services and products and created an ecosystem of tools to help businesses grow and scale their operations.Source: S&P Capital IQ.Square's ecosystem consists of approximately 30 different software, hardware and financial services products, and the company monetizes these products through a combination of subscription, transaction and service fees.Source: S&P Capital IQ.As of June 2020, the company has two reportable segments: Seller and Cash App:Source: Square's 10-Q, Q2-2020. Amounts shown above exclude Caviar business, which was sold in FY2019.Q2-20 total revenue increased by $749.4 million (or 64%) YoY, while YTD June-20 revenues were slightly higher (1% up) versus prior year.Square generates virtually 100% of its revenue in the United States, with international markets representing only 3% of total revenue:Source: Square's 10-Q, Q2-2020.Gross Payment Volume dropped (14.9%) YoY due to the negative impact of COVID-19, reaching $22.8bn in Q2-20. Adjusted EBITDA was down (7.0%) vs. Q2-19, settling at $97.9m for Q2-20:Source: Square's 10-Q, Q2-2020.Gross Payment Volume is defined as the dollar amount of all card payments processed through Square (net of refunds). GPV also includes Cash App transactions related to P2P payments through credit cards and business accounts.Source: S&P Capital IQ, Square's Investor Update - March 2020.Below is a full reconciliation of Net Income/(Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for Q2-20 and Q2-19:Source: Square's 10-Q, Q2-2020.June-2020 LTM Adjusted EBITDA came in at $357.1m, up 11.8% YoY.The company is in a solid financial position as it has historically avoided carrying excessive debt amounts, a reasonable choice since it is still unprofitable on a GAAP basis. Square has $1bn in convertible debt, with the most recent issue convertible at a price of $78 and due in 2023. Given the impressive run and fair value estimates well above $78, it is likely these notes will mature out of the money and should thus be treated as debt. Even though the company is unprofitable on a GAAP basis, stock-based compensation makes up a significant portion of its expenses. As a result, the company turned cash flow-positive in 2017 and the improving EBITDA margins will likely increase free cash flow meaningfully over the coming years.Finally, the capital-light nature of Square's business gives the company significant flexibility, and even though its growth has mostly been organic, this should give Square sufficient room to consider cash-based acquisitions to fill gaps in its ecosystem.The company is led by Jack Dorsey, who was also one of the original founders. Management has successfully developed a unique business model by taking a holistic approach to creating a suite of services to address a variety of merchants' needs. It is important to note that Jack Dorsey is not only splitting his time across two companies (he is Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) CEO), but he also effectively controls Square, being both CEO and chairman and having almost half of the voting power with his current holding. Dorsey's conflict is especially important as the company keeps growing its top line at 30%+ and just begun to explore opportunities for international expansion.With Dorsey's attention divided among two companies, the CFO role is of critical importance. At the end of 2018, CFO Sarah Friar departed to join social network Nextdoor, and in January 2019, she was replaced by Amrita Ahuja, who previously spent eight years as CFO of Blizzard Entertainment.Analysts are expecting top-line CAGR of 24.2% between 2020 and 2022, and growth is likely to continue in the coming years supported by the shift toward electronic payments and by the rapid adoption of Square's ecosystem. EBITDA margins are expected to improve, with analysts forecasting an 8.7% EBITDA margin in 2022 versus 1.8% in 2019. Margins have room to further improve in the coming years, with an average EBITDA margin of 31.9% for the Information Services industry (source).Source: S&P Capital IQ.Margins and top-line growth should be sustained by the company's ability to cross-sell ancillary services to its base customers and by the growing focus on international expansion.Data by YChartsSquare currently trades at 11.4x LTM EV/Revenue, slightly higher than Global Payments (9.2x), but roughly in line with PayPal (12.3x) and still below the peak reached in September 2018.Source: S&P Capital IQ, proprietary research.Analysts are expecting significantly higher top-line growth compared with other companies in the industry (24.2% 3Y expected CAGR vs. 14.3% median of selected companies in the software industry). Average revenue per year of $9.4bn expected over the next three years at a median EV/Revenue multiple of 8.2x would suggest a short-term price target of around $175, roughly 12% upside from current levels.11.4x revenue is not cheap by any means, but I do believe Square is worth an investment even at these levels, given strong expected top-line growth and room for margin improvement.As Square's revenue is directly dependent on merchants' revenue, the company is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. The focus on micro and small businesses amplifies this exposure as many small businesses could easily fail following the COVID-19 pandemic.The clients' interest in services like Instant Deposit and Square Capital, while positive for the company in the short term, could suggest Square's customer base might be fragile. Moreover, Square's international expansion poses execution risks as the platform has been the subject of system breaches in the past. As the company expands internationally, its steep pricing offer could be a limiting factor on the overall achievable market share, especially as companies put in place cost-cutting initiatives in response to the current pandemic.Finally, there is risk surrounding the company's ability to launch a consumer business around Cash App, as payment platforms tend to show winner-takes-all dynamics and Square's competitors have larger customer bases. Until now, Square has been extremely successful in launching and growing the Cash App platform, but in the long term, this could ultimately be a distraction from more meaningful opportunities in its core Seller segment."
4374086,105812,2020-09-14T09:47:13-04:00,"Square has created two strong ecosystems: the Seller Ecosystem and the Cash App Ecosystem.
        These ecosystem are built around payments and commerce, and will benefit from the trend towards digitization in both of these markets.
        While growth has slowed in some areas during the pandemic, Square's revenue growth accelerated in both Q1 and Q2'20.
        Cash App monthly active users have grown 93% annually since 2016, reaching 30 million in Q2'20.
        Square is a buy for longterm investors.","Square’s (SQ) business is centered around commerce and payments, and given the trend towards digitization in both of these spaces, Square is positioned to capture value in coming years.My investment thesis can be summarized as follows:1. Square has created two strong ecosystems, both of which provide valuable services to buyers and sellers. These ecosystems are fortified by high switching costs and network effects.2. Square's Seller Ecosystem and Cash App Ecosystem both have a large total addressable market, and the global shift towards e-commerce and digital payments will drive growth in coming years.3. Discounting recent headwinds related to the pandemic, Square's business is expanding quickly, as is evidenced by the annualized 41% revenue growth since 2015.Square has built two strong ecosystems: the Seller Ecosystem and the Cash App Ecosystem. The Seller Ecosystem provides an array of products and services that help democratize commerce, enabling merchants to run their business. While less robust, the Cash App Ecosystem provides a mobile wallet that allows individuals (and businesses) to send and receive P2P payments, in addition to other functionality.Source: Square Investor Update (March 2020)While Square has numerous competitors, Square's ecosystems offer a more robust solution than any competitor's products. To truly appreciate this, it's necessary to discuss Square's product offering and the numerous ways in which they generate revenue.Hardware:Square sells point-of-sale hardware. This primarily includes the Square card reader ($49), Square Terminal ($299), and Square Register ($799).Software:In addition to the Square POS application, which is free, Square offers other applications through a SaaS business model. This includes Square Online Store, Square for Restaurants, Square for Retail, and Square Appointments.Square Online Store allows merchants to easily set up an online storefront, helping them take advantage of the shift towards e-commerce. A free version exists, but with limited features compared to the three paid tiers, which range from $12/month to $72/month. Merchants already using Square at brick-and-mortar locations are able to upload their existing inventory to create an online presence instantly. Merchants can also establish a social media presence by linking their online store to an Instagram Business Account. Finally, merchants have access to shipping options through third-party carriers, enabling them to provide a seamless customer experience.Square Appointmentsenables merchants to create a customer booking website, allowing clients to schedule appointments. This also includes Square Assistant, an automated digital messenger that handles client confirmations and rescheduling requests. Square Appointments can be linked to Square Online Store to provide a more complete web experience. Pricing depends on the number of employees, ranging from free (1 employee) to $90+/month (6-10+ employees).Square For Restaurants is a version of the Square POS application optimized for restauranteurs; additional features include close of day reports, sectional sales reports, table/seat management, and many third-party integrations. Square For Restaurants also syncs with Square Online Store for digital ordering. For full functionality, Square charges $60/month for each location (using one POS device per location). Each additional POS device costs $40/month.Square For Retailis a version of the Square POS application optimized for retail; additional features include inventory management, sales reports, employee time-clock, and many third-party integrations. For full functionality, pricing starts at $60/month per location.In addition to the software discussed above, Square offers optional add-ons that provide further service to merchants. Square Payroll allows merchants to manage all aspects of employee payroll, from direct deposit to providing tax forms. Merchants pay $29/month plus $5 per person on payroll each month. So a business with 10 employees would pay $79 per month. Square Marketing allows merchants to create email marketing campaigns. These campaigns can also be posted on social media, such as Facebook. Merchants can choose to setup automated campaigns for birthdays, new customers, regular customers, or lapsed customers. Pricing depends on the audience size, ranging from $15/month (less than 500 customers) to $425+/month (75,000+ customers).Finally, Square’s app marketplace offers a variety of third-party integrations with the Square POS applications, such as Wix or Intuit QuickBooks. And Square charges a monthly fee for many of these integrations.Payments:Square provides payment processing and gateway services. This allows merchants to accept digital payments both in stores and online. In general, Square charges the following fees for payment cards and digital/mobile wallets:Square Capital:Square offers loans to small businesses, ranging from $300 to $100,000. Because they have access to granular seller data, Square is able to asses credit risk in a prudent manner. Square charges a fixed fee for this service, typically 10% to 16% of the loan amount. Then, based on the payback terms, a portion of the merchant’s non-cash sales are deducted daily to repay the loan. Square Cash App:Square’s P2P Cash App allows users to send and receive payments, including paycheck direct deposits. The Cash App also allows users to invest in stocks and purchase bitcoin. The application can further be used to make in store purchases, though this requires the merchant to have the app or the buyer to have a Square Cash Card (Visa branded debit card linked to Square Cash balance). Square charges users 1.5% for instant transfers and 3% for P2P payments funded by a credit card; merchants are charged 2.75% per transaction when the Square Cash App is used to make in store purchases.To summarize, Square's Ecosystems can effectively engage users and generate revenue in many different ways. And due to easy integration, each product makes it more convenient to start using additional products. This is a powerful concept that should continue to drive adoption for both new and existing users over time.Square estimates its total addressable market at ~$165 billion, more than 26x TTM revenue. So, while Square has grown significantly in the past, there is still plenty of growth left ahead. And the global shift towards e-commerce and digital payments should be a powerful catalyst for both the Seller Ecosystem and the Cash App Ecosystem.The Seller EcosystemThe Seller Ecosystem generates revenue in three different segments:Hardware represents only a fraction of revenue (less than 2% in 2019), but Subscriptions & Services and Transaction Fees represented a combined 87% of revenue in FY19. And these two segments should see strong growth in the coming years, driven by increasing e-commerce sales (Square Online Store) and increasing volumes of digital payments.But how much growth should investors expect?Square estimates its total addressable market (NYSE:TAM) through the Seller Ecosystem at ~$102 billion. This is further broken down in the graphic below:Source: Created by the author using data from Square Investor Relations.In 2019, Square generated $3.46 billion in revenue from the Seller Ecosystem, representing YoY growth of 27%. Even so, this figure accounts for less than 4% of the estimated TAM.But I believe Square will continue to execute on this opportunity. Since 2015, the number of active sellers has increased 1.7x (roughly 14% per year). At the same time, gross profit per seller has increased 2.3x (roughly 23% per year).Source: Square Investor Update (March 2020).In other words, Square is not only increasing its seller base, it is monetizing its seller base more effectively. Square's business is scaling and gross margins are expanding as more sellers join the ecosystem. This dynamic has powerful implications for future growth and profitability. And it should only strengthen over time, as Square offers merchants a turnkey solution, helping them manage nearly every aspect of their business, from payments to payroll; this creates high switching costs, as merchants would find it difficult to find another provider who could offer that level of support.Also of note, the Square Card (not to be confused with Square Cash Card) allows merchants to spend the balance of their Square account, giving them instant access to revenue generated by their business. And Square is using this product to create a network effect within the seller community, as Square merchants receive a 2.75% discount when using their Square Card to make purchases from other Square merchants.The Cash App EcosystemThe Cash App Ecosystem generates revenue in three different segments:In FY'19 low-margin Bitcoin revenue accounted for 11% of total sales. But, as mentioned earlier, higher margin Subscriptions & Services and Transaction Fees accounted for 87% of revenue. This mirrors Square's outlook for the future, as 97% of the Cash App market opportunity lies in the sending and spending of money, both of which will benefit from increasing digital payment volume.Square estimates their TAM through the Cash App Ecosystem to be ~$63 billion. This is further broken down in the graphic below:Source: Created by the author using data from Square Investor Relations.Lately, the Cash App Ecosystem has been growing even faster than the Seller Ecosystem. In 2019, Cash App generated $1.11 billion in revenue, representing 157% growth YoY. And this growth accelerated substantially during the pandemic. In Q2'20, Cash App revenue reached $1.2 billion, increasing 316% YoY—this means Cash App generated more revenue in one quarter than it did for the entirety of FY'19. Likewise, the number of monthly active users reached 30 million in Q2'20, representing 93% annualized growth since 2016. While this was due in large part to Cash App's facilitation of pandemic-related stimulus payments, it still created an incredible number of new users. And the strong network effects created by the P2P functionality will likely keep many of these new users engaged with the platform. But investors should pay attention to these metrics in future quarters.Even with the recent growth, Square's monetization of the Cash App Ecosystem is still in the nascent stages. For instance, Square only recently started exploring payment functionality beyond P2P transfers. In 2017, Square introduced the Cash Card, a debit card that allows users to make purchases (both in stores and online) with their Cash App balance. This plays right into the digital payments trend (and potentially, e-commerce). Up to this point, Square only benefited when merchants accepted digital payments. Now they benefit when Cash App users make purchases with digital payments. In Q2'20, the number of Cash App users making purchases with the Cash Card increased to over 7 million—more than 100% growth YoY. This positively impacted Subscription & Services revenue, which includes interchange fees collected by Square when users make purchases with the Cash Card. In Q2'20, Cash App-related Subscription & Services revenue increased 130% YoY. Of equal importance, an increasing number of merchants began accepting payments via the Cash App. This positively impacted Transaction revenue, which includes transaction fees collected by Square when merchants collect payment through the Cash App. In Q2'20, Cash App-related Transaction revenue increased 215% YoY. Both of these are positive trends, and demonstrate the power of digital payments to act as a catalyst for overall revenue growth.If Square can continue to build on this functionality, perhaps by offering a means of using the Cash App directly at NFC terminals, this could be a very powerful growth driver, as it would reinforce the burgeoning network effects and help the company further capitalize on the shift towards digital payments.As I mentioned earlier, a good portion of Square's revenue is generated through transaction fees. And because these fees are assessed as a percentage of gross payment volume (GPV), investors should watch this metric very closely. The graph below shows GPV from 2015 through the most recent trailing twelve months.Source: Created by the author using data from Square Investor Relations.As indicated above, GPV has increased an annualized rate of 27% since 2015. However, growth slowed significantly in Q1'20 and GPV actually declined YoY in Q2'20. But this was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as Square's business is heavily exposed to brick-and-mortar retail. However, there is a silver lining here. In Q2'20, GPV from online channels increased over 50% YoY, as both new and existing sellers made the transition to digital sales. During this quarter, GPV accounted for over 25% of total GPV. This bodes well for Square going forward, as Square Online Store, Square Online Checkout links (allow merchants to sell on social media or through email without a website), and various developer APIs (add Square payment functionality to any e-commerce site) allow sellers to benefit from the shift towards e-commerce.Given the overall upward trend in GPV, it's no surprise that Square's revenue growth has been stellar over the same time period. Since 2015, Square has grown revenue at an annualized 41%. And despite slow or negative GPV growth, revenue growth actually accelerated in both Q1 and Q2'20 (reaching 44% and 64%, respectively). However, gross margins took a significant hit in these quarters, as low margin Bitcoin revenue contributed significantly to the top line. Despite this, revenue growth of this calibre is encouraging, especially given Square's exposure to brick-and-mortar retail during a time period characterized by social distancing and government-mandated business closure.The graph below shows TTM free cash flow from Q1'17 through the most recent quarter.Source: Created by the author using data from Square Investor Relations.Free cash flow has also grown quickly, achieving a 103% CAGR between Q1'17 and Q1'20. But as the graph above indicates, free cash flow trended sharply downward in Q2'20. This was primarily a result of capital being tied up in loans. According to Square's most recent 10Q filing: Square Capital facilitated roughly 80,000 Paycheck Protection Program (NYSE:PPP) loans. And PPP loans facilitated, less loans sold, accounted for a $465.5 million decrease in operating cash flow. But I don't think investors should be overly concerned at this point. Risk associated with the loans is low due to government backed guarantees. Furthermore, despite the negative impact on cash flow, these loans offered a lifeline to many sellers. This is a valuable service during a turbulent time, and in offering this service, Square further reinforced the high switching costs associated with its platform.While Square has a robust offering of products and services, they also have strong competitors. For instance, PayPal (PYPL) offers similar hardware and payment functionality. And, while PayPal does not provide an e-commerce solution or software tailored to retail/restaurants, they have partners that do offer these products. Likewise, PayPal and Square offer a similar fee structure, though PayPal charges cross-border and currency conversion fees—Square does not. But Square merchants cannot use hardware outside of the country in which the account was created.Shopify (SHOP) is another formidable competitor. And recently, these two companies' markets have started to overlap in a bigger way. Whereas Square started by providing payment functionality in stores, Shopify started by providing an e-commerce solution. Now, Shopify has started offering POS hardware and Square Online Store helps merchants build a digital storefront. And, while Shopify does not provide some of the in-house functionality that Square provides, such as payroll or software tailored to retail/restaurants, merchants can gain this functionality through Shopify’s app store. Regarding fee structure, Shopify and Square offer similar pricing per transaction, though Shopify charges cross border and currency conversion fees. But Shopify Payments has the benefit of being more widely available, as it exists in all of Squares markets (US, UK, Canada, Japan, Australia), plus several other countries. But what do users think?Software Advice ranks retail software based on several criteria, all relating to customer satisfaction. And as the chart below indicates, Square POS compares favorably to these two competitors:Source: Software AdviceSo, despite the competition, customers still like Square's POS application, and Square still has a significant market opportunity. Moreover, this is not a zero sum situation—there is plenty of room for all of these businesses (and others) to be longterm winners.As a final note, Square is not an inexpensive stock, at 11.3x sales and 222x earnings. However, it compares reasonably well to these competitors, as PayPal trades at 11.4x sales and 84x earnings, and Shopify trades at 52x sales and a negative earnings ratio.Square's Seller Ecosystem offers merchants a turnkey solution, helping them manage nearly every aspect of their business. This portion of Square's business is fortified by high switching costs and, to a lesser extent, network effects. Supplementing the Seller Ecosystem, Square's Cash App Ecosystem affords users with P2P functionality, allowing them to receive, send, spend, and invest money. This portion of Square's business is fortified by a strong network effect. And, if Square can continue to expand purchase functionality within the Cash App, this network effect could get a lot stronger.At current valuations, Square is a pricey stock. But both of Square's ecosystems should benefit from global trends towards e-commerce and digital payments. For this reason, Square is a buy for longterm investors."

As rational investors, a deeper dive into SQ's valuation would indicate its current price is overvalued.There is a strong short case for SQ.","Editor's note: Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Eric Weiss as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. Click here to find out more »While Square (NYSE:SQ) has certainly enjoyed the technology/payment tailwinds of COVID-19, it seems unlikely that Square can maintain its current or future suggested growth rates and thus it appears to be the most overvalued offering among its competitors. Since the quarter ending June 30, Square has officially separated its business into two reporting segments - Seller Ecosystem and Cash App. Before we go into detail, you might want to take a look at Table 1 below and check out this article to get a better idea of the ""who is who"" in the payment processing industry.Table 1. The Payments EcosystemSource: BUSINESS INSIDER Intelligence: The Payments Ecosystem 2020When Square onboards a seller, it not only provides them with online and offline point-of-sale (POS) services but it also acts on behalf of small sellers as the Merchant of Record (MOR). Generally, when a seller does not have the resources to become their own merchants of record, as many small businesses do not, Square comes in and bridges the gap. Square assumes financial responsibilities for its sellers and that's why when customers order goods from businesses utilizing Square, they see Square as the name of the seller on the receipt rather than the sellers name.The actual payment processing, however, is done by third parties. As of June 30, 2020, Square disclosed that two of its largest 3rd party payment processors process between 50% and 35% of its total settlement receivables. Those two processors are believed to be Chase (NYSE: CCF) Paymentech and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) Merchant Services. Thus, in some ways, we can think of Square as a service reseller or distributor, making complex processing services more accessible to small businesses. This business model works because Square adds value to both parties: it solves painful admin problems for a lot of small businesses all while bringing extra business to payment processors. The ability to efficiently connect supply with demand has always been an important and monetizable value-add in any economy.Furthermore, on the small business side, Square also provides instant transfer, payroll services, issues prepaid debit card and extends loans. Sound familiar? Well, it is akin to the boiled down services of a bank. In fact, this article here explains this with great details.Its Cash App ecosystem includes even more bank-like services, such as fund transfer, cash cards for in-person spending and brokerage services for customer investments into equities and cryptocurrency. With recent regulatory approval to establish a chartered bank, Square becomes one of the first fintech firms to plant its feet in banking industry, which makes me wonder whether its goal all along was to become a digital bank, while the seller and cash app ecosystems are just ways of building out its customer network.All that being said, its shares have gained almost 400% in value from its March low and institutional analysts have been chasing retail investors increasing their target prices time and time again. The jump in price can largely be explained by the overall increased market liquidity seeking ""COVID-safe"" outlets to invest and a company that has largely benefited from the where others have faltered during the pandemic is an obvious choice. The consensus target price, in my opinion, have merely chased retail trends, desperate to ensure they are not too far off from market valuation.Thus, the question we must ask ourselves as investors is, ""do we believe in the potential that has clearly been priced in?"" ""Do we have the confidence that the priced in expected growth is sure to happen?"" Here, reverse-engineering, while simple. is still a quick and handy way to seek guidance surrounding existing valuations.Square has yet to achieve steady and consistent profits, all the while its current valuation is based on high expectations of continued future growth as well as injected liquidity. Moreover, inflated stock prices are the case for the entire market, in particular the digital payments space. As investors, particularly long-term ones, we need a quick way to filter and choose relatively cheap or reasonably priced stocks with strong promise of consistent future growth. While most reader's will undoubtedly associate ""reverse engineering"" with discounted-cash-flow analyses, here we will assume a return on investment we would like to achieve with long positions on Square, and then we will analyze what would have to transpire to realize those returns as well as the relative likelihood of those transpirations.Let's start by assuming that the current valuation is correct, then go backward and deduce what growth rates are implied by this valuation and just how likely such growth rates will become realized.Of course, many assumptions must be made and one of the most important ones is the price that Square should be trading at. When Square one day matures and investors/analysts are relatively confident in its growth trajectory, it should not be trading at its current sky-high level. Just as a rough guide, the forward price/earnings ratio (P/E) of established competitors Visa (NYSE: V), MasterCard (NYSE: MA) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) are 35.77X, 40.73X, 45.01X, respectively. Now, let's first assume Square will be trading higher, at 60X and 40X earnings five and ten years from now, respectively. We also need to account for how much capital gains we want to realize through investing in Square. If we focus on long term and are happy earning 7% on our SQ investment each year, then we would be looking at stock price of $221.15 and $310.18 in five- and ten-years' time. Such prices would imply earnings per share (EPS) of $3.69 and $7.75 five and ten years from now, respectively.Table 2. Forward expectations for SQTable 3. 5 year and 10 year profit margins for SQ matched with P/ESource: Yahoo FinanceIf you are wondering whether or not it is likely for Square to double its share price in 10-years' time, let's quickly take a look at Visa, the golden child of the industry. In March 2013-5 years after Visa's initial public offering (IPO), its stock was trading at around $40 per share and now, 7 years later, its risen over 400%. During this time, Visa's revenue and net income compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) were 11.78% and 15.91%, respectively (as of fiscal year-end 2019, based on company filing). Thus, if you truly believe SQ is set to have a double-digit year over year top- and bottom-line growth consistently over the next decade, then doubling its price is actually considered cheap.Now back to our assumption on margin improvement; as Square's operations becomes more efficient and its expansion stabilizes, we assume an 8% and 11% profit margin (PM) 5 and 10 years from now, as compared to an almost 0% right now and an ~13% PM from its peer PayPal. To simplify the calculation further, we can assume the number of shares outstanding goes unchanged over the next 10 years. Considering these assumptions would lead us to the implied future Net Income and Revenue, from which, we can finally calculate the implied growth rate. In our case, under the previous assumptions, the CAGR would be 25.41% and 16.85% for the next 5 and 10 years, respectively.Looking at the latest several quarters and taking out the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) business (which has very low margin) and the effect of COVID-19, we can see that Square is already growing its revenue at a declining rate that is below 30%. Thus, to sustain a 25% revenue growth for another 5 years would be very difficult and unlikely. More importantly, its business is not without competition and has relatively low barriers to entry. Small businesses can choose between Venmo, Zelle, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) Pay and PayPal -- some of which are free services. Going forward, the card networks might also enter the arena since their reach, processing capacity, security measurements and network of users have already provided them the advantages of building almost any fintech application.As for the profit margin, using PayPal's 13% as a general guide makes sense, but only for now. Going forward, with digitalization being the center theme of most everything, competition will intensify and margin will be narrow. Eventually it undoubtedly becomes a judgmental call and different investors bring different biases to their analyses. For me, based on the aforementioned findings, I do not believe in the high CAGR implied by Square's current valuation.We are now in a less than rational market defined by inexplicable investment behavior with still a lot of uncertainties and unexpected events on the horizon. In financial markets, it is almost always the case that no matter how fundamentally correct we are, we would still lose money going against the market. Therefore, instead of going against the current trend favoring SQ, I would suggest shorting some out-of-money calls or buying some out of the money put LEAPs. SQ has a historical volatility of 60.59% and an implied volatility (IV) of 57.3% for its September 2020 190 call. This means that this call is reasonably priced relative to its historical level. By receiving a ~$2 premium per share, we are looking at a break-even level of $192 per share, which is higher than almost all street analysts' Dec. 21 target price. If we were to use longer-term options, perhaps to pass the uncertainty of election and hoping to get more recovery from COVID-19, I would be looking at short positions in Jan. 15, 2021, 200 call, with IV = 60% and premium of $10."
4370683,22148,2020-08-25T14:33:04-04:00,Square saw Q2 revenues surge due to worthless Bitcoin trading revenues.The mobile payments provider actually saw net revenues decline in the quarter when excluding Bitcoin.The stock trades at a substantial premium to peer PayPal despite weak quarterly results.,"Amazingly, Square (SQ) has surged to new all-time highs despite fundamental weakness in their prime payments business. Investors should consider the rally to $150 general luck and exercise caution. My investment thesis still warns investors to tread lightly here when the market cap has topped $75 billion.Source: Square websiteMy warning once the SEC required Square to quit reporting adjusted revenues was this exact outcome. The company would see a surge in meaningless transaction-based revenues leading investors to misinterpret the benefits to the mobile payments provider.In Q2, Square reported revenues surged an incredible 64% to $1.92 billion. The amazing part was that core gross payment volumes (GPV) were down 15% in the period to only $22.8 billion.Source: Square Q2'20 shareholder letterWhat the market generally glossed over was all of the growth was due to Bitcoin revenue. This category surged $750 million from only $125 million last Q2. Net revenues were actually down to $1,048 million when excluding Bitcoin revenues of $875 million.The reason to essentially exclude Bitcoin is that the revenues are only pass through. In Q2, Bitcoin's gross profits were only $17 million out of $875 million. The service adds no value to the business.Going back to the traditional adjusted revenues that the SEC doesn't want to report anymore, Square saw revenues grew 21% to $677 million from $561 million. The quarter was impressive as mobile payments shifted to Cash App, but this adjusted revenue base doesn't support a market valuation in excess of $75 billion with 500 million diluted shares outstanding.The key to using the adjusted revenues is the removal of the transaction-based costs that topped $1.2 billion in the quarter. Otherwise, the Square financials are really difficult to analyze.In the official GAAP numbers above, gross margins collapsed to only 31%. A payments company with such low gross margins wouldn't normally trade at elevated valuations. Not to mention, investors have to worry that the company will actually report revenue declines in future quarters when the Bitcoin revenues decline again.Ultimately, what matters is that gross profits were $597 million in the quarter from $466 million last year. Very impressive for a tough environment, but annual gross profits in the $2.4 billion run rate aren't enough to justify the market value considering the high level of spending in order to generate these profits.Square had $620 million in quarterly operating expenses. Sure, this amount includes $173 million in stock-based compensation, but the amount is reflective of the actual costs of both cash and stock compensation leading to the large share dilution. Square only had 487 million shares at the end of the last Q2.Even in a market where competitor PayPal (PYPL) has seen its stock rise nearly 100% YTD, the valuation comparison is nowhere close. PayPal now trades at a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of nearly 40x, but Square is up at a 200 multiple.Data by YChartsThe prime reason for the valuation discrepancies is that PayPal hasn't seen business disrupted as they aren't reliant on sellers with physical stores or businesses shut down during the pandemic fears. Square has seen its business impacted by the shutdown, but the stock is still up 100% for the year due to excitement surrounding Cash App and Bitcoin trading revenues while EBITDA has taken a hit.Even looking at the original estimates for the year, management had an EBITDA target for 2020 of $510 million. For a stock with an enterprise value of $73.5 billion, the stock trades at 144x the original EBITDA estimates.The perplexing part of the trade is the business hasn't gotten better. Cash App volumes are up substantially with YipitData showing volumes re-accelerating in mid-August, but the company has seen the negative offset in the core mobile payments business.The key investor takeaway is that Square has seen enough business disrupted to not justify the current market valuation of the stock. If not for the change in reported revenues back to GAAP, the market wouldn't have bought up Square following Q2 results. Investors need to look at the recent highs as setting up a potential top in the stock not supported by the actual fundamentals."
4364859,22201,2020-08-05T16:14:49-04:00,"Square's earnings leaked Tuesday, as a result, the company officially published them early.Traders saw a huge revenue beat and bid the stock up sharply.The revenues were driven by a surge in Bitcoin trading which doesn't actually produce meaningful income for Square.Looking past the Bitcoin noise, this was a poor quarter for Square. The stock remains misunderstood and overpriced.","Square (SQ) made some unexpected headlines on Tuesday. The company was scheduled to release earnings on Wednesday; however, the figures apparently leaked early. Tuesday afternoon, Square's investor relations team stated that:And they provoked quite the market response. The company reported seemingly blowout results, with revenues, in particular, beating expectations by hundreds of millions of dollars. Traders bid the stock up more than 10% in the after-hours session on the news. Unfortunately, there's far less to this earnings ""beat"" than you'd think. I'll explain in a second.First, though, this earnings leak is most interesting. Remember that, just last month, Twitter (TWTR) was hit with one of the largest hacks in social media history. The hacker took control of Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, and Barack Obama's accounts, among others, and could have tweeted anything. Fortunately, the hacker appears to have been a youth who used his power merely to try to run a cryptocurrency scheme. However, having the accounts of world leaders get hacked like this has terrifying national security implications.I stated in my previous Square article that:Impressively, in less than a month since I wrote that, Twitter got hit with a devastating hack and now Square's earnings somehow leaked off their website a day early.This is not a reassuring pattern. It's particularly problematic for a financial institution like Square that now generates nearly half its revenues from Bitcoin trading. Unlike traditional assets, if Bitcoin gets hacked, your money is usually gone for good.These sorts of issues wouldn't be funny even for a normal bank, and they're particularly troubling given Square's reliance on emerging platforms such as phones, mobile wallets, and crypto assets that are inherently less secure.For the quarter, Square reported $1.94 billion in revenues. That was up a jaw-dropping 64% year-over-year and blew away analyst estimates. Analysts had forecast only a small rise in revenues, not hundreds of millions of dollars increase. Square's stock immediately jumped 10% Tuesday evening as traders saw the huge number.So, what's the catch? The revenue increase was all from Bitcoin trading. And Square doesn't make much money from Bitcoin - it earns a meager 2% gross margin on this business. Brokerages like Charles Schwab (SCHW) would look like some of the world's largest businesses if they reported revenues this way rather than counting only the commission portion of the transaction.And, in fact, Square's Bitcoin business is essentially run at cost. Some bulls have described it as a customer acquisition device - basically, you run the brokerage with no expectation of making money so that people discover your platform and buy other far more profitable services from you.That's fine - good in fact. Loss leaders are a classic marketing technique from grocery stores where you sell some popular high-volume products at cost or at a negative margin to get people into the store. Then, the shopper buys the more niche stuff you want them to at a high margin.Over time, for Square's App/Online Banking model to work, they need to attract a ton of cash - the goal is to get sticky deposits. The Bitcoin trading business is a clever way to get folks in the door.But that's all it is - a marketing technique. A good one, in fact, judging from this quarter's numbers. However, traders treating these Bitcoin revenues as material to the business are making a huge mistake. The Bitcoin business is now half of Square's ""revenues"" yet produces essentially no gross margin let alone EBITDA or profit:Source: Square's earnings release.There it is - a 2% gross profit on these revenues. And those $875 million of revenues is almost half Square's total haul for the quarter. Anyone valuing Square on a price/sales multiple is now engaging in a pointless exercise, as you're mixing high-value payments revenues with minimal value Bitcoin. Moreover, as Bitcoin's price wanders around, Square's revenues will also surge and plummet accordingly.Here are Square's numbers for the quarter:We already discussed revenues - excluding Bitcoin, Square earned $1.05 billion of revenues, and growth would have been non-existent. Gross profit grew by far less than net revenue and the year-over-year rate is markedly decelerating.On a net income basis, Square has returned to its loss-making ways after squeezing out a surprise profit last Q3. Excluding the holiday quarter, Square still doesn't consistently generate positive operating income. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA continues its downtrend since peaking in Q3 of last year. Gross payment volume also slumped 15% year-over-year.Still, though, bulls may say, gross profit was up. So, it was a good quarter. If you think that, though, ask yourself why profits slumped.One cause was that transaction losses surged, as Square showed with this vague chart from their earnings release:We did get some more detail in the earnings release. And as I had suggested in my previous article, loan losses are rising:Specifically, Square sees loan losses happening at 2.5x the pre-pandemic frequency. That's not great, though not terrible either. It's well within the realm of what we'd expect for making loans to small and not particularly credit-worthy businesses.Overall, the company lost $38 million to lending and transaction losses (again, they don't appear to break this out separately to quantify which is which). Considering that Square lost $11 million overall for the quarter, this continues to be a big drag on earnings - they would have scratched out a small profit if it weren't for the drag here.You might say that we were expecting a bad quarter for Square. With the pandemic, many small businesses are shut down, and some will never reopen. Surely, this would have an impact on Square's numbers. And it has - we see it in the quarterly results. Ignoring the Bitcoin fluke, metrics were down significantly on most fronts.So, why not give Square a pass for the drops in income, EBITDA, payments volume, and so on?Simple: because the stock tripled last quarter:Data by YChartsSay all you want about people intellectually knowing it would be a bad quarter, actual traders bid the stock up to the moon on hopes of the pandemic driving faster adoption. However, the numbers you see above don't justify the stock being above where it traded in 2019, let alone double that.If you own Square stock, you should be careful about praising this Bitcoin driven revenue number. The Bitcoin revenues are a red herring and don't make a material difference to Square's operations.Bitcoin has rallied from $6,500 to $11,000 since the beginning of April. Plus people were stuck at home, and thus had more time to take up day trading on Robinhood along with swinging crypto holdings around on Cash App. Hence your 600% pop in Bitcoin action at Square this quarter. When Bitcoin goes back to $6,500 and folks that were bored and trading compulsively go back to doing other stuff, now Square is set up to take a massive year-over-year revenue loss as that ephemeral activity disappears.I don't think Square's owners really want the stock to be traded as a crypto derivative. While that may lead to a good Q3 given Bitcoin's current momentum, levering your stock price to crypto is probably not ideal.Anyone remember what happened next after Bitcoin hit $19,000 at the end of 2017? For now, though, enjoy your short-term stock price pop."
4364557,102764,2020-08-05T05:43:49-04:00,"The recent earnings from Square show that the company keeps firing on all cylinders in a challenging period.The seller ecosystem is of great value to merchants during the pandemic, and financial performance is proving to be resilient.Cash App is booming and benefiting from accelerating demand in an industry in which scale and market leadership are key success drivers.The stock is not too expensive at all when considering the company's financial performance and long term growth prospects.The bullish thesis for Square looks stronger than ever based on the most recent numbers from the company.","Square (SQ) provided a double surprise to investors on Tuesday. The company was originally scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday but it had to release the numbers on Tuesday instead ""due to early external access of the company’s quarterly financials"" according to the press release. Not only were the numbers released sooner than expected, but they were also surprisingly good considering the circumstances. Square is performing exceptionally well in a challenging period, and a log-term bullish thesis for Square looks healthier than ever. One of the main reasons for concern among investors in Square leading to the earnings report was the company's large exposure to small businesses and especially restaurants in the seller ecosystem. These kinds of businesses have been particularly affected by the pandemic during the second quarter, and this is arguably the main uncertainty factor weighting on Square stock.But the company is doing a great job of providing the tools for sellers to adapt to a new environment and continue thriving under all kinds of challenges. Square is making it easier for sellers to develop an online presence with tools such as Square Online Checkout, which allows sellers to sell online without building their own website. The company also launched On-Demand Delivery during the quarter, this is a platform that provides sellers with access to a platform of third-party delivery apps. Because of the scale advantages provided by Square, sellers using On-Demand Delivery retain better margins in comparison to directly using other third-party delivery services.A key driver during the quarter was expanding online channels. Gross Payment Volume (NASDAQ:GVP) from online channels was up more than 50% year over year during the quarter, and it accounted for more than 25% of total seller GPV. As a comparison, only 11% of total GPV was coming from online in the second quarter of 2018.Source: SquareThe power of the ecosystem remains intact, one in three Online Store sellers onboarded in the second quarter were new to Square, and many of the new sellers who onboarded to Square Online Store also adopted other parts of the company's ecosystem, including in-person commerce.Revenue from the seller ecosystem amounted to $723 million and gross profit was $316 million during the quarter, these numbers were down 17% and 9% year over year. Although GPV declined during the second quarter, management noted that the business improved sequentially each month in the quarter.Seller acquisition was strong during the period, and the company registered an increase in gross profit from new sellers year over year. Cohorts of new Square sellers generated higher gross profit in their first five weeks after onboarding than seller cohorts who joined our platform during the same period a year ago, and this bodes well in terms of future performance when the economy goes back to more normal times.Square seller's ecosystem faced tremendously challenging conditions in the second quarter of 2020, and the business is being resilient. The company is also proving to be of value to its sellers in a difficult environment, planting the seeds for sustained growth when the recession is over.Everybody was expecting a strong performance from Cash App during the quarter, and the numbers did not disappoint. Cash App produced $1.20 billion in revenue and $281 million in gross profit, growing 361% and 167% year over year. Excluding Bitcoin, Cash App revenue was $325 million, up 140% year over year.Cash App engagement also benefited from disbursements of the CARES Act stimulus programs and unemployment benefits, including a portion of customers who direct deposited these payments into their Cash App accounts. Cash App reached over 30 million monthly transacting active customers in June, with more than 7 million spending on Cash Card during June.Source: SquareThe analysts at ARK Investment Management calculate that digital wallets in the US could be an $800 billion opportunity by 2024. PayPal's (PYPL) Venmo and Cash App are the two leading players by a wide margin, and they are benefiting from strong network effects.Source: ARKUsers attract each other to a leading digital wallet such as Cash App, meaning that the top players in this area tend to get stronger as they get bigger over time. The pandemic has accelerated the demand for digital wallets in a major way, and Square is in the right place to leverage this massive opportunity over the years to come.Overall financial performance was more than healthy during the quarter. Excluding Caviar from the second quarter of 2019, total net revenue increased by 70% and gross profit grew 32% year over year. Not only were the numbers better than expected, but these numbers also show impressive resiliency from Square in a challenging period.In terms of valuation, Square currently trades at a price to sales ratio around 11.6, which is in line with a price to sales ratio of 11.8 for PayPal. Big and more established players in the payments industry like Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) carry higher prices to sales ratios of 17.4 and 18.6 respectively.Granted, Square is much smaller and less profitable than other payments players, but the company is also growing much at a much faster speed, so the degree to which Square should trade at a valuation discount is a matter of debate.In any case, it is fair to say that Square is not excessively valued at all for a company that has just delivered a 70% increase in revenue during one of the most challenging recessions in history.When looking at the data from the second quarter of 2020, the main takeaway is that Square is executing remarkably well, adding value to its users, and producing solid growth for investors in a difficult environment. The long term bullish thesis in Square as solid as ever."

That said, if you look at Square's actual business, it seems an awful lot like a bank.It moves money around for its small business customers, charging fees for various services. And, increasingly, it's lending lots of money to those clients as well. Pretty bank-like.And, needless to say, bank stocks are worth far less than Square is currently trading for. What's more, we've seen other companies pitch themselves as FinTech operations and earn dazzling stock prices. Later, reality set in, and shares crashed. Square may experience a similar shift in coming years.The crux of my argument is that Square is closer to a bank than a technology company. The first tip-off to this is that Square had been trying to obtain a banking license for years, and FDIC finally approved their application in March.In March, Square obtained its banking license from the FDIC. This will allow the company to take deposits with FDIC insurance and provide many traditional banking functions. It's the next natural progression for a company that was moving strongly in this direction already. In March, Square issued a press release stating that:Jacqueline Reses, Square Capital Lead and Executive Chairwoman of the board of directors for Square Financial Services, said that:I don't need to add much commentary here. Square is opening a regular FDIC-approved bank to directly loan customers money and take their deposits.Previously, it relied on a third-party bank for many of these functions (see page 30 of Square's 10-K for more information). Now, however, with their own regulated bank, Square can aggressively lean into its small business banking business. It's game on once their bank launches in 2021.Getting a banking license is an obvious marker of your intention to become a bank. However, Square was already heading down this path for a long time before the FDIC made it official.Square Capital exists to provide lending services to its small business customers. Here's how it works - from the 10-K:Square makes loans in one day to customers that wouldn't otherwise be eligible to get loans. Thus, this is something akin to subprime lending with modest underwriting requirements. This is an inherently risky business. Not necessarily bad - higher-risk loans tend to earn higher profits - but investors should be aware of how the sausage is getting made.Now, to be fair to Square, lending isn't a huge part of the business - yet. Square doesn't break out Square Capital's revenues directly in the 10-K, so I don't have a precise figure. Square Capital is lumped in with subscription and service revenues, which also includes fees on Cash App and Instant Transfer services.Last year, Square brought in $3 billion of payments revenues and $1 billion of subscription and services revenues (where Square Cap's revenues are counted). So, Square Capital seems modest in proportion to the whole business.However, consider that subscription revenues (which includes lending) grew 74% last year, while payments grew just 25%. In dollar figures, subscription/lending revenues grew nearly $450 million versus $600 million for payments. And this was before Square got its banking license. Imagine how fast they'll be able to ramp up the Capital side of the business once they can start taking deposits and making their own loans directly rather than having to use a third-party intermediary.It's no secret that Square's stock was a dud after its IPO when it was relying on the payments business for growth. It's worth considering that now, as the subscriptions (i.e. lending) revenues take off, the stock price has finally soared. Keep that in mind when analyzing the whole company. Are slow-moving payments or fast-growing subscription (i.e. lending) revenues driving the stock price?But, a bull may say, Square sells the loans to third parties. So, it isn't taking credit risk. As we know, Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) get high multiples. That's while credit card companies that hold their own loans, like Capital One (COF), earn rock bottom multiples. So, isn't Square worthy of a high multiple since it shuffles off the credit risk to others?That's not the whole story though. The 10-K says:The word ""majority"" is carrying a lot of weight here. Is Square selling 51% of loans to outside investors? 95%? I spoke to one Square bull who thought the figure was in the 85-90% range but didn't provide a source. From my reading of the 10-K, it's unclear.In any case, Square notes that it uses third-party lenders so that ""it can increase the speed"" with which it grows Square Capital. This seems to imply that Square is using lending for a huge portion of their growth. They're not just selling loans to offset risk - they're selling loans so that they can write more loans faster.That brings back echoes of 2006 subprime housing where mortgage shops were pitching loans as hard as possible to questionable borrowers so that they'd have more product to sell for collateralized financial instruments.In that instance, the banks said they'd offloaded their exposure to third parties. That was true for many banks - it was not true for others, however. Investors that didn't do their due diligence work there got blindsided.Just from reading Square's 10-K, I don't see enough data to make a clear risk assessment. There also appears to be some sort of putback provision where Square gets stuck with loan losses if a loan is underwritten poorly - which certainly might happen when Square is making loans in just one business day. The 10-K notes that:We do know loan losses are increasing. Square's loan losses grew by $10 million last year, though they don't seemingly report the base figure.On page 57 of the 10-K, Square notes that its loan and transaction losses overall surged 44% in 2019 to $127 million, but I don't see a breakdown for what percent of those losses were on transactions versus loans. Transaction revenues only grew 25% last year though, so it's doubtful that losses on transactions grew at a huge rate. As such, loan losses probably grew at a high rate - 44% or even higher. In the 10-K, Square seemingly acknowledged the loan problems and said that it is training its risk models to fine-tune loan performance.$127 million might not sound like a huge number. However, Square only earned $308 million in net income over the past 12 months, so transaction and loan losses are costing a major chunk of the potential bottom line results. A bank that lost a third of its net interest income to fraud and loan losses would certainly tighten the belt there. Investors may apply a higher level of scrutiny to Square's losses as well.Again, I'm happy to treat Square as a bank, and value its lending operations accordingly. Small-business lending is a highly profitable niche for many community and regional banks, and Square should have some proprietary edge in the segment since it has detailed transaction data on its vendors. However, just from the 10-K, it's hard to parse out how much loan exposure or downside risk Square's investors are taking from the capital business.That's not all as it relates to Square acting like a traditional financial firm. The Cash App's investing features are also subject to SEC and FINRA regulation. From the Square 10-K, we find that:You know who else is subject to net capital requirements when handling customer money? Big banks with brokerage arms like Morgan Stanley (MS). This is fine - it's a normal part of doing business as a bank. I have no issue with Square operating brokerage services.My complaint is that tech investors view this regulated low-margin business as being worth a SaaS price/sales multiple. Look at the multiples of a Morgan Stanley or Charles Schwab (SCHW) and then ask yourself why Square's brokerage revenues should trade at a 3x multiple to those.Now, Square bulls can say the majority of revenues from payments and other revenue streams, not lending. That's true for now and will be for at least a few more years, even given current trends.However, that doesn't exclude Square from potentially being viewed as bank. Consider that U.S. banks in aggregate earn around 35% of all their income from sources other than interest.That's monthly fees, overdraft protection, ATM fees, safe deposit boxes, income from insurance, wealth management, and other services for business and wealthy clients. There are also trading and derivatives gains at the big banks. There are a million ways that banks can make money. Interest in the leading one, but it's hardly the only part of the equation. Square earns a lot of income on similar nickel and dime things such as instant deposit fees that are functionally equivalent to non-interest income at banks.Traditional banks, far from being stuck in their ways as some might think, have become far more adept at monetizing customers across the transaction chain. Here's interest versus non-interest income for all U.S. banks:SourceFurther, as you can see, while total interest income is cyclical and has only modestly increased since the 1980s (thanks to falling interest rates), total noninterest income has soared and - given current trendlines - could actually overtake traditional interest income at all U.S. banks sooner or later.""Traditional"" banks are more and more resembling FinTech companies, while the FinTech companies are now getting traditional banking licenses. Funny how that goes. It'd be a shame if their valuations converged as well.The problem with being a unicorn stock or company is that investors have unrealistic expectations. People that are long expect the company to transform everything - to disrupt the existing order and create entire new financial ecosystems.And sure, that might happen. But it's an awfully lofty goal, and thus, even a successful business that generates strong profits and cash flows will fall short of the great expectations built into Square's current stock price.It becomes glaringly obvious when you look at Square as a bank. Square is currently earning a 20% return on equity, which is high for a U.S. bank, though not unreasonably so. In a good economy, you might expect investors to pay 2.5-3.0x book value for a fast-growing bank with a well above-average ROE, like Square.With Square's book value of $4.16 a share, however, that gets you a stock price around $10-$12. Not so great, given that Square is trading for $130 today.Let's take a best case banking scenario. Square becomes the new all-in-one finance center, doing everything for clients. In other words, it's Citigroup (NYSE:C) circa 1999. Citigroup sold everything - insurance, retirement plans, online stock trading, and more. It operated everywhere - it had branches from Argentina to Indonesia. And everything was available (or would soon be) online. Digital financial technology on every corner of the globe. Citigroup was hailed as the ultimate financial machine, and politicians feared its inevitable reach and seemingly unstoppable monopoly.At the height of the Citigroup empire, it traded up to 7x book value when the dot-com boom was at its fullest. Your FinTech leader reached a never-before seen level for a finance company:Data by YChartsSquare, by contrast, would trade at $30 today if it enjoyed the same excitement as 2000s top digital finance company at the height of that mania.In other words, Square at $130 (30x book) is utterly blue sky territory for a banking company. Square bulls probably say - but it's not a bank. To which I say: ""Why are they making more and more loans and obtaining a bank charter?""More directly on point, remember the LendingClub (LC) IPO a few years ago? They had developed subprime-lending-as-a-service (SlaaS?) and were valued like a tech company. They were going to ""democratize"" lending on the internet and cut out the greedy banks while offering better interest rates to customers.What happened? If you just use revenues, LendingClub has been a total and unadulterated success:Data by YChartsUp and to the right like any good compounder stock.Alas, LendingClub ""bought"" revenues by seemingly underpricing the risk on their loans. Investors received poor returns and the platform struggled, despite the rising revenues. The stock has been a fiasco even as revenues keep chugging along:We've seen this is it FinTech or is it a bank debate before. Anyone remember Bank of Internet? After some unwanted publicity, it renamed itself Axos Financial (AX) and retreated from the spotlight. However, five years ago, it was one of the hottest Fintech stocks around.Axos offers entirely 100% digital banking - there are no branches. They only offer limited call center support with the intention being that everything happens online. To this day, Axos appears to be a fintech company looking at their investor presentations - count the references to ""digital"" and ""data"":SourceBack in 2015, when Bank of Internet/Axos appeared to have re-imagined banking in the 21st century, the stock was a rocket. Shares were up more than tenfold at one point:Data by YChartsEven now, the chart looks pretty good. But anyone that bought after 2014 has made zero return. Square investors may be buying a 2014-era Axos now.Axos' valuation multiples soared as well as the ""future of banking"" story took hold:Data by YChartsIn 2013, bulls pitched AX stock as a tech company and, thus, suggested that investors value it on revenues. It hit 11x price/sales as the peak and remained in stratified air for several years. Its price/book topped out at 5x.In recent years, Axos has doubled profits and revenues, yet the stock price has gone down. That's because Axos re-rated to being a normal bank rather than a tech company. It now sells at 1.1x book and 2.5x sales - perfectly normal figures for a bank.Let's make this analogy even scarier for Square holders. Square is currently running a 20% ROE and growing the business in the high 30s annually.Axos ran a 20% ROE at the height of its valuation and has grown the business 30%/year over the past decade, look at the CAGR figures:Axos 10-year financials/Source: QuickFSYet, after a decade of tremendous operational performance, the all digital ""new banking"" firm sells for 7x earnings and 1.1x book value.What happens to Square's stock price if and when investors conclude it too is a small business bank in a shiny tech-friendly package?It's not a big leap of logic - Square's 10-K is littered with references to credit, and they just obtained a banking license. The risk factor is staring us in the face.Now, consider what might happen to the stock price if people both conclude that Square is a bank and that it has significant credit risk. It does lend to small businesses that would struggle to get credit at other places after all. Traditionally, in a recession, investors would fear having this sort of credit exposure.Currently, as Square is perceived as a tech company, none of these risk factors is relevant to the stock price.But it's all still there, lingering, in the background. I haven't seen Square stock bulls address these concerns, which makes me think that much of the investor base isn't aware of or at least hasn't really addressed the downside here. Which means, in the event that credit risk rears its head, you could see a mass rush for the exits.Can you short Square stock today? As a hedge against other cloud/SaaS stocks you own, it probably works. Additionally, Jack Dorsey raises questions as a CEO, so a management discount should return - just look at Twitter's (TWTR) sorry life as a public company, after all.And the current economic mess should hit Square to some extent. Small businesses are getting devastated in this downturn. There are also loan and transaction losses - these grew 44% at Square last year. Not great, given that 2019 was a boom year for the economy. Who knows how high loan losses and payment fraud could run during a recession - it's a risk factor that most other SaaS stocks don't face.Still, it's not thrilling to think about shorting Square outright. The market is perceiving Square as a tech company just as it sees Tesla (TSLA) as a tech company. We can argue all day that Tesla is a car company and Square is a bank. And we'd be right on both counts. The stock prices, however, can stay inflated for as long as the market continues to mis-classify the underlying business.That said, Square stock traded for around 3-4x sales in 2016 and 2017 after its IPO. At that point, the market was valuing Square purely on its payments business, as lending wasn't a major focus, and Cash App didn't take off until 2018.So, purely as a payments company, Square was trading for about one-third of today's valuation. Then they added lending and Bitcoin trading revenues, both of which should earn lower multiples than the payments business. If anything, Square's multiple should be going down, not up. In any case, a return to 2017 price/sales multiple would put the stock at $30, or $40 if you use forward revenues and have an upbeat view on the economic recovery.If the market moves to value Square on price/book value, as it does for other financial stocks, the downside could be even farther. Square's book value currently sits at $4.16/share. Thus, even a robust 3x book value ratio in line with Square's above-average (for a bank) ROE ratio would still only value SQ at $12.50 per share.Keep in mind, however, that it would be easy for Square to raise its book value by doing a secondary offering with the stock up here. And in fact, it wouldn't surprise me if they do this ahead of their bank launching next year. Of course, a secondary offering can be, in and of itself, a catalyst for a short position.If you do short Square directly, borrow shouldn't be an issue. Interactive Brokers, for example, currently has millions of shares available to short at a less than 1% annual rate.Consider Valeant. Bill Ackman taught the market to think of Valeant in terms of ""platform value"" and M&A runway. Analysts pegged their models to that. One day, the market collectively went back to valuing Valeant as a drug company using passé old-school metrics like cash flow. The stock collapsed.Square makes loans, is aggressively growing the loan business, and just took out a banking license. One day, if investors logically value it as a bank, look out below."
4364019,105176,2020-08-03T23:31:28-04:00,"Despite having several services resembling that of a traditional banking institution, Square is not just another bank. The company has abilities to offer serious competition to existing banks.Usage of cash in the US still remains high and Square's TAM is barely penetrated.Companies across industry types, from Amazon to General Motors, have leveraged financing and lending to boost their sales, but that doesn't make them comparable to traditional banks.In my opinion, Square will leverage the strength of its Cash App ecosystem, to boost seller experience through the Cash Boost program.Growth potential for Square remains strong. Dips in the stock price represent long-term buying opportunities.","Square (SQ) has surged 10x since its IPO and is currently at all-time high levels. Yet, I believe there is a lot more where that came from, for long-term investors due to the strength in the seller ecosystem, the traction for the Cash App ecosystem and the growing adoption of cashless payments.The terms and methods of payments have evolved greatly over the years, with increased convenience, lower fees and ease of use being the driving factors.Image SourceThe credit card terminal was introduced in 1979 by Visa (V), but even in 2003, more transactions were paid for by check than by any other method. One of the biggest reasons for that was that credit card payment acceptance was a challenge for many businesses.Square (NYSE:SQ) was founded in 2009 to simplify this very problem for small businesses. In the last 10 years of its growth, the company has diversified into wide ranges of financial services to support businesses. We are currently in the era of digital payments and are moving towards a cashless society.We now have electronic payment technologies like Square’s Cash App, Zelle, PayPal (PYPL), and Venmo (a subsidiary of PayPal) that are helpful for person-to-person payments (P2P payments). The adoption of these digital payment methods is still at its infancy and there are a lot more growth opportunities ahead. A Statista survey in early 2019 reveals that cash was still a popular choice in 2018-19, but I believe COVID-19 is providing a push for businesses to adopt cashless payments.Small-business lending is an increasingly competitive area in fintech. PayPal has a program called Working Capital and provides loans to merchants based on sales history. Amazon (AMZN) also has a similar offering for sellers, and began extending credit to small business owners in 2011. Over the years, several Fintech players like Square, Robinhood, SoFi, etc. have applied for ways to become banks as doing so would give them better profit margins and the ability to diversify their product offerings.The eCommerce giant has financial services spanning across pretty much every domain as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM).Source: CBI ResearchThe idea is simple. If Amazon can get you lower-debt payments or give you a bank account, you’ll buy more stuff on Amazon. Same way, if Amazon can offer you a line of credit at low interest rates, then you will be able to buy more inventory to sell on Amazon.SourceFurther, Apple is able to obtain interchange revenue on all transactions, earn revenue through interests while continuing to accumulate additional end-user data to enhance the customized user experience.Source - General Motors 10KBy offering financing to customers, businesses can boost their sales, land larger contracts and increase their average sales transaction size. Financing allows customers to make regular, affordable payments toward the cost of a big-ticket item, instead of paying the full price upfront. Further, financing increases the company’s revenue generation as well, thereby creating a win-win situation for the company and its customers.It is clear that there is a large segment of the population that isn’t well served by traditional banks. In my opinion, big tech could probably deliver these services better. Their platforms have reliable infrastructure and the data to help predict the services needed.Earlier this year, Square received the nod by federal and state regulators to open a bank in Utah. The company will be able to use this opportunity to boost Square Capital to achieve increased flexibility in its small business lending program. That means Square will soon be able to originate commercial loans to merchants that process card transactions through its payments system.Image sourceLooking at the way Square ties its current product offerings together, it is clear that the company’s banking desires are to increase their relationship with customers (sellers). In 2019, Square put its Weebly acquisition to use by expanding its online store product and enabling sellers to set up their online store.I believe every Square investor has seen the below image explaining Square’s two ecosystems.SourceHowever, I believe there are several synergies in the two ecosystems, and think the customer centric Cash App is likely to feed into the buyer ecosystem.Source: Modified by the authorSeller EcosystemSquare combines software, hardware, and financial services to create products and services initially tailored for small businesses. Then, the company realized that small businesses may eventually grow out of them and wanted to prevent that from happening. Today, Square’s seller ecosystem bundles a wide range of services including:Software Products and Services:Square is currently rated as one of the best POS systems overall. In this segment, Square directly competes with eCommerce enabler Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Intuit’s (INTU) QuickBooks.Image SourceHardwareImage SourceThis space is quite competitive with many players, however, the important item to note is that Square’s hardware is the doorway for its suite of services.SourceFinancial ServicesThis is where Square highly resembles the functions of a bank.Square attempts to provide a suite of services to small businesses, and competes directly with payroll giants such as ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) and Intuit QuickBooks.Source: Author’s designCash App Ecosystem:Storing, Sending, and Receiving Funds: There is no need for a traditional bank account anymore.Spending: Interchange revenue through the use of Cash Card. Further, there is the Cash Boost program which offers discounts to certain businesses.Investing: Customers can also use Cash App to invest their funds in US stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or buy and sell Bitcoin.Source: Author’s designHowever, due to the ability to invest and trade bitcoin, I would say Square’s Cash App also competes with platforms popular among the younger generation such as Webull and Robinhood.Source: Author’s designEven within Cash App, I believe Square attempts to consolidate the typical requirements of an individual and provide all services under one roof. Cash Boost concept is at its inception at present, but the way I see it, Square can provide discounts to Cash App customers for merchants within the Square ecosystem, thereby bringing sellers and buyers together.Based on the description of services listed above, calling for Square to be valued as a bank is like asking to value Amazon as a bookstore during its initial years and Tesla (TSLA) with any other automobile manufacturer (I still have my doubts over the latter, but will go with the sentiment for now). Even if Square is considered a bank, in my opinion, it has significant competitive advantages compared with traditional banks.Looking at revenue growth, Shopify leads the pack with a CAGR of 67% since 2015, followed by Square at 39%.Data Source: WSJData Source: WSJSquare trades at a slightly lower P/S multiple compared to PayPal and Intuit despite having higher growth. I agree that 10x sales isn’t cheap, but considering the TAM for its ecosystems, it could be justified.In the article by Louis Stevens , Cash App is noted to be gaining traction faster than its rivals during this pandemic. Square’s banking license approval and the growing traction in Cash App puts Square as a leading contender in the digital banking space. The addressable market is huge in both Seller and Cash App ecosystems and Square is barely getting started.SourceSquare reported a 44% YoY revenue growth in the first quarter.Since restaurants and stores were closed during the first quarter, it wasn’t surprising that GPV was down. However, Square’s card-not-present offerings, such as Virtual Terminal, Invoices, and eCommerce API, were less affected, and the company reported to have seen an acceleration in GPV from eGift Cards and Square Online Store compared to the rest of the first quarter. Since businesses began slowly opening up since June, I expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to show growth in GPV.Further, during the month of April, the company saw record direct deposits in Cash App, revealing that a large number of users received their CARES Act stimulus payment. This indicates ease of use and flexibility in using the platform.SourceWhile the Paycheck Protection Program loans are likely to keep several businesses afloat, the coronavirus is expected to permanently shut millions of small businesses in the next several months. This could significantly affect Square’s seller ecosystem customer base.This may affect Square’s revenues in the near term, and probably drive the stock price lower, giving more buying opportunities for long-term investors.The actual damage done by COVID-19 to the economy is still unclear. Yet, I am confident that the pandemic has nothing but accelerated the adoption of cashless payments and increased the purpose and meaning behind the company’s offerings. One of the most profound trends we have seen is the move away from cash payments towards electronic, ‘cashless’ payment methods. In my opinion, the biggest victim of the pandemic will be physical money.In my opinion, Square will continue boosting its Seller and Cash App ecosystems with tuck-in acquisitions. The recent acquisition of Stitch Labs to boost seller operations management is just one among many to come.These are just examples of already existing services. Founder/CEO Jack Dorsey is a visionary and I am sure his team can come up with far bigger revolutions in global payments.Image source Also, Square is currently only available in the US, Canada, UK, Japan and Australia. There is a whole world of opportunities to expand.Square may very well be a bank from a regulatory standpoint, but it surely is much bigger than your traditional bank. I see seller and Cash App ecosystems growing strongly in the next 5 years, with adoption fueled by the need to go cashless. I recommend Square to long-term investors."
4357614,104941,2020-07-09T02:46:56-04:00,"I analyze the rise of Square's Cash App Ecosystem via the study of crucial metrics like active users, revenue per active user, and google trends data.
        Square's Cash App is the fastest growing digital wallet in the United States. Moreover, it has multiple revenue streams (large TAM) and several new growth avenues (new products/markets).
        According to my estimates, Cash App alone is worth ~$26 billion, which is more than 50% of Square's market capitalization.
        As more users adopt Cash App, Square's free cash flow (and by extension share price) is set to go higher. This article also includes the guesstimate exercise that shows my valuation of Cash App.
        I rate Square a buy.","Source: techstartups.comSquare (SQ) has been one of my top buy ideas since March this year, and even after a +250% rally from my March recommendation, I continue to remain bullish on the company. Today's article is an extension of our recent discussion on Square's Cash App (P2P) Ecosystem. I recommend that, before you read further, please peruse Square: This Multi-Bagger Is Just Getting Started if you haven't already done so.We will be covering the following points in this research note:So, let's get started.I've already discussed the functionalities of Cash App, but just to recap:Source: Square Investor Update March 2020Cash App started out as a peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfer application at the end of 2013. Over the years, the platform has seen the addition of new and innovative products like Cash Card, Direct Deposits, Bitcoin Investing, Boost (rewards), and Equity Investing (with fractional shares). Recently, Square got its banking license, and I expect Cash App's evolution to culminate in a futuristic digital bank. In my opinion, Cash App will begin lending operations some time within the next decade in the same way that it's lent to the underserved of small business throughout its history.According to Square, Cash App has a Total Addressable Market of $60+ billion in the United States at present. This figure could very well grow in the future as the company adds new products or expands into other markets. Since Cash App's penetration of its $60 billion TAM stands at <2%, the eco-system has a long runway to grow its market share.Source: Square Investor Update March 2020As you can see in the image below, Cash App MAUs have snowballed higher from ~7 million to ~24 million (~3x times) in the last two years. In fact, Cash App's user growth rates of ~60% CAGR make it the fastest growing digital wallet in the United States. In the meantime, the industry leader, Venmo (PYPL), has seen a drastic slowdown in user growth.Source: Square Investor Update March 2020Cash App's exponential growth in the last two years can be attributed to a pop-culture (it's been mentioned in several rap songs massively popular rap songs) like following among the younger demographics. Cash App reaps impressive benefits from the network effect generated from a loyal user base when it comes to acquiring new customers and getting inactive users back on the platform.In March, Cash App was the second-largest player in the peer-to-peer (P2P) payment application and digital wallet space in the United States behind Venmo.Source: www.google.comHowever, Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) trends show that Cash App has been trending significantly more than Venmo in the last three months. Since these numbers are a precursor to growth in user accounts, I think Cash App could already be the largest P2P payment application based on monthly active users (MAUs) [more than 30 million].The reflection of Cash App's high popularity in google trends data is evident from the latest announcements from Square related to the business trends observed during March-April:Source: Square Q1 2020 Shareholder LetterThus, one can see that Cash App had its best month ever in terms of net user growth in April 2020. Since then, Cash App has consistently seen very high ratings on google trends data. In my opinion, Cash App added ~5 million new users during the first six months of 2020.Square also made 11 million user accounts eligible for direct deposits. In May, the cash balances stored in Cash App accounts had risen to $1.3 billion.To perform an accurate guesstimate exercise for Cash App, we must first of all look into its revenue mix. Let's begin.Source: Square Q1 2020 Shareholder LetterAs you can see above, Cash App had total revenues of $528 million in Q1 2020 (~ARR of $2 billion). However, Bitcoin revenues contributed to $306 million with minimal contribution to gross profits. Hence, we will not take Bitcoin into account for our guesstimate exercise. The subscription + services-based + transaction-based revenues generated from Cash App contributed to ~$222 million in revenue and registered ~80% gross margins. This segment has an Annualized Revenue Per Active Customer of $30.Source: Square Investor Update March 2020Since 2017, Cash App has multiplied its ARPU by 2x times, and the platform still has ample room for monetization.Source: Square Investor Update March 2020Square is famed for its product-velocity, and I expect the company to add several new products to the Cash App platform while potentially leveraging its banking license shortly.Square is simultaneously developing two financial technology platforms, i.e., Seller and Cash App ecosystems. As I mentioned earlier, Cash App could eventually become a full-fledged digital bank with millions of customers (it already is in many senses). On the other end, Square's Seller ecosystem has millions of sellers. Square's probable long-term vision is to merge them and extract value-add synergies for both Cash App users (Buyers) and Square merchants (Sellers).Square could be on the verge of creating the holy grail of payment systems. By merging the Seller and Cash App ecosystems, Square has a closed-loop payment system (buyers and sellers) with no other intermediaries. Thus, Square will receive a larger share of the economics. On top of that, Square will be able to freely cross-sell services between and among merchants (Seller Ecosystem) and consumers (Cash App) without the hindrance associated with traditional payment systems.Using the data from previous sections, we narrow down to the following table:Source: AuthorThe estimates for 2025 are just my opinion based on conservative estimates for user growth and ARPU for the Cash App ecosystem. Since Bitcoin is a shallow margin business for Cash App, I do not factor it in for my guesstimate exercise in this section.Using the lower end of revenues (2020) and assuming a free cash flow margin of ~35%, we get a free cash flow per share of $0.6. I also utilized a conservative revenue growth rate of ~30% CAGR for the next ten years. Here's the fair-value of Cash App on a standalone basis (excluding Bitcoin):Source: L.A. Stevens Investment ModelThus Cash App alone is worth ~$60 per share, which half of Square's current trading price of ~$120. If you'd like greater clarity on the valuation of the company, please refer to our more extensive valuation of the company in our most recent article (linked above).Investing in revolutionary, rapidly growing companies can be challenging; in that, we can't always perfectly forecast the evolution of the company in the future. One of the greatest tools in our tool kit is to assess management and its vision. I have always listened closely to Jack Dorsey and his philosophies revolving around Square, and it has consistently led to me purchasing more shares of his company.To that end, the growth potential for Square's Cash App platform is massive. I expect Cash App to be a significant growth driver for Square's free cash flow in the long term as new products are launched on the platform.Square stock has rallied since my last article, but investors could still generate mid-teen CAGR returns on a base case ten-year investment.Key Takeaway: I rate Square a buy.As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow for more, and happy investing!"
4358340,103910,2020-07-17T09:00:00-04:00,"Square is currently valued as a high-flying FinTech company.However, it's rapidly turning into a bank.If investors value Square as a bank rather than a tech company, the stock could lose 50-75% of its value.1999-era Citigroup, LendingClub, and Bank of Internet all serve as good examples of what Square's future could look like.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO subscribers, who also got 7 days' exclusive access to Ian Bezek’s original Top Idea on Square (NYSE:SQ). Ian Bezek worked on the buyside for several years before moving to Latin America to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. Find out more about PRO here.Seeking Alpha: Can you briefly summarize your bearish thesis for readers who may not have seen it yet?Ian Bezek: Square stock is up 90% year-to-date, and has tripled off the March lows. Today, the market is giving Square a $52 billion market cap. Yet, the company hasn't done much to justify such a lofty valuation yet. It's producing around $5 billion annually of revenues and is only marginally profitable.Bulls argue that Square's limited profitability is fine, as Square is still scaling up. In a few years, as the company's ecosystem broadens, it will start delivering strong profits and cash flows. However, a closer look at Square raises doubts. For one, Square largely focused on payments when it went public and wasn't particularly successful. In recent years, as it pivoted toward lending and brokerage services, the stock price has surged.However, lending and brokerage aren't traditional high-margin businesses that earn software stock valuations. They're regulated industries with modest profits and a lot of capital requirements. Square is still being valued as a SaaS stock and is priced accordingly at 11x revenues. Yet, as it turns to lending and brokerage, its price/sales ratio should be going down, not up.And now, Square just got its banking license application approved and plans to launch operations 2021. This should further push Square's revenue growth toward lending and compress Square's valuation toward a bank-like multiple.In fact, if the market starts to perceive Square as a lender, the stock could be valued on book value, something like 3x book would be normal for a fast-growing lender with an above-average ROE. Unfortunately, Square's book value is under $5/share, implying a massive wipeout for shares.Sticking to the market's preferred Price/Sales, Square traded for less than 4x when it was a struggling payments company in 2016-17. More recently, it generally traded under 8x sales – the current 11x valuation seems particularly dubious given the glaring risk Square's small business clients face due to the coronavirus business closures.SA: As we’ve seen so far this year, valuations for large cap tech stocks don’t matter on the way up but matter a whole lot on the way down – can you discuss how this applies to SQ and how you see this playing out?Ian Bezek: Investors should think about what goes into Square's valuations, specifically on revenues. You have the payments part of the business, which is the largest chunk of revenue, but is relatively slow-growing. In Square's early days as a public company, it traded at a low P/S ratio despite being almost entirely payments revenues. It's unclear why their payments business should now be valued at 11x sales.You've got Bitcoin and equity brokering revenues, which are a growing chunk of Square's mix. Theoretically this might be a lucrative field if Bitcoin goes on another parabolic run. On the other hand, Bitcoin could fizzle out. Brokerage firms like Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) sell for 3-4x sales, so in any case, investors should be cautious paying 11x for Square's revenues here. Brokering is a competitive industry that is profitable but not worthy of glamorous multiples.And then, of course, there's the lending business. I don't think this should be valued off sales at all – that's not how you look at banks typically. But if you do want to use a sales multiple, it'd be something modest like 2-3x. Typically banks and alternative lenders are judged off book value in conjunction with return on equity. By those metrics Square is extravagantly valued.In a raging bull market, people aren't really thinking about how much Square's lines of businesses are worth. Still, even assuming tech keeps flying, price/sales should become a limit fairly soon. Who is going to buy Square at a theoretical 15x or 20x sales? The alternative being a faster growing pureplay SaaS stock with no credit risk or headaches with financial regulators and banking licenses slowing things down.Meanwhile, on the downside, when people start thinking about the values of each Square business on its own, they will arrive at a sum-of-the-parts much smaller than today's quotation.SA: You made an excellent comp to similar companies where this didn’t end well (at least for their stocks) – do these types of mispricings exist partially because investors simply forget these cautionary tales or is there more to it than that?Ian Bezek: In a vacuum, it might be easy to imagine Square becoming the next Visa (NYSE:V) and earning similarly high profit margins and valuations. However, Square's efforts as a standalone payments network weren't especially successful. Look at the company's earnings and stock performance in the quarters immediately following Square's IPO for proof of that.And the other lines of business they are moving into now, such as banking and brokerage, simply don't offer the same blue sky potential. They require far more capital and generate much lower returns. That doesn't mean that Square should avoid them; banking is a good business. It's not clear that Square was a compelling product merely as a payments processor – the effort to create a full financial ecosystem is rooted in sound business strategy.But it's not a business model valued at 11x sales. Investors should lower their expectations.As I explained in the article, we've seen plenty of companies skate the line between bank and FinTech before. You have Citigroup (NYSE:C) back in the late 1990s, which sold every financial service imaginable under one roof and was fast to get its digital offering rolled out. However, it became too big to manage, and Citigroup ended up as a bloated mega-company that subsequently got blindsided in 2008.You have several internet banks that aimed to revolutionize banking by getting rid of branches and putting everything online. This makes sense, and in fact internet banking appears to be a viable model. But it's not nearly as disruptive as its backers had hoped. Meanwhile, alternative online lenders and lending platforms like LendingClub (NYSE:LC) have had poor runs as public companies.LendingClub is particularly informative as it has shown growing revenues since going public, but its credit underwriting has been poor so the stock price collapsed anyway. People buying Square or other FinTechs simply because revenue is going up quickly should ask more questions about the quality of revenue.In the case of Square, the combination of payments, small business focus, and a consumer app is certainly new. They've taken a novel approach to the FinTech start-up, and as such, none of my analogies are a 100% fit to Square's situation. However, there are plenty of failed companies that have tried to disrupt each segment that Square is going after, as my examples demonstrate.Square could certainly succeed – in fact, it wouldn't surprise me if they carve out a reasonably-profitable business in at least one or two of their niches. However, Square is already valued at more than Charles Schwab, and Square is up to 75% of Goldman Sach's (NYSE:GS) market cap. Square has to prove far more in terms of execution before it will be in the same league as the country's leading brokerage or investment bank.SA: The advantages of SQ getting into banking are obvious – what are the potential disadvantages or negatives, especially in the economic environment we’re in now (or could be in soon)?Ian Bezek: Credit risk is the obvious concern, particularly given Square's focus on smaller businesses. Square underwrites loans to businesses that would, in many cases, otherwise not have access to bank capital. Square also approves many loans within one business day. This combination means that Square is seemingly underwriting a significant portion of its credit book with only modest diligence into the creditworthiness of the borrower.Now sure, Square has access to a borrowers receipts and thus can make a decent estimate of revenues going forward based on past sales. That probably works pretty well in normal times. However, we have no idea how resilient Square's lending model will be in the current downturn; small business is a specific pain point within the economy since many of these businesses have no revenues at all during lockdown. And they don't have the financial resources that a large business would to endure a period of total shut-down.Let's assume Square's lending performs fine during the current downturn. Even then, there's a hidden downside to the move into banking. This is that it ties up their balance sheet. As of last quarter, Square had just $6 billion in total assets. And much of that is in things such as PP&E and goodwill which can't be used to backstop a loan book.Even levering up its assets to, say, 10x, Square would be a minnow among other banks. The national banks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have total assets exceeding two trillion dollars each. Square can't disrupt much of anything at its current size. If Square intends to become a major player in the banking space, it will need to bring in a lot more capital. This could be from its bank (from depositors, brokered cds, etc.). However, generally internet banks have had to pay high deposit rates to attract capital, thus neutralizing many of their other advantages.Or Square could raise capital by selling more stock. I'd argue this would be a reasonable move for Square's long-term value, as it'd raise money at a generous share price. However, that dilution would hit investors that were buying today, particularly if Square announced that it was raising funds to seed its bank. If you're buying Square at 11x sales, it'd be painful to see them dilute the stock to pump money into a lending business that will only be worth 2-3x sales ultimately."
4355686,24443,2020-06-25T15:05:22-04:00,"Square is a disruptive financial business that is likely to grow over time.Square also has the Cash App, which provides another underappreciated disruptive financial model.Square’s Cash App is likely to benefit from any Bitcoin resurgence as an easy and trusted access point.Square’s LEAPS (long-term options) peak at a low strike and appear to represent a strong opportunity.","Square (NYSE:SQ) is an innovative financial company. The company's core business is to provide small businesses with the ability to perform credit card and related digital transactions and to subsequently offer supplemental services. Square also has a whole other flourishing business in its Cash App, which has become a digital wallet and brokerage hybrid.Square's potential for near- and long-term growth appears significantly underappreciated by the market, including even the available options. As Square breaks out of its current multi-year range, available strikes on Square should increase. I believe that the existing long-dated and highest strike SQ options represent a significant opportunity for near-term appreciation and outperformance for the next couple of years.Square's namesake business is designed to help small businesses that use the platform to accept digital payments. This makes Square an essential support system for many existing small businesses and a probable tool for new entrepreneurs.The company also offers supplemental financial solutions for its customers that can increase its revenue and profit margins. Square attempts to use its data to make more tailored credit decisions that it hopes will provide merchants with credit at better rates and the company with less risk than traditional small merchant creditors take.Square's Cash App provides it with another business line that is likely to continue growing quickly. The app's core personal cash transfer business has proven an easy way onto most smartphones. Square continues to add features into the Cash App, including Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and fractional equity ownership, which makes it one of the more capable types of financial accounts.(Source: Square Investor Update)The Cash App is one of the easiest ways for an individual to get exposure to bitcoin, or least it appears to be one of the easiest ways to explain to somebody how they can buy bitcoin. Individuals who already have the app on their smartphone are able to add bitcoin functionality quickly, and without having to download and learn a new app. If bitcoin does perform well, the Cash App will likely benefit from it.As a result, I believe it is likely that the Cash App will capture a significant share of the next wave of bitcoin adopters. Similarly, the app is an easy way to add equity exposure, and its fractional share purchasing model could make it an appreciated brokerage by new investors who have limited capital.(Source: Square Investor Update)As the Cash App's user base grows, it should add a significant amount of revenue that will largely come from transactions that are wholly disparate from the core Square business. The increase will be dramatic as the user base and the average number of transactions per user both continue to ramp up.While Square will likely feel pressure in its core business, the Cash App is likely to be a major source of growth. The lack of appreciation for that growth is a large part of the long thesis. Moreover, beyond the probable substantial growth the app is likely to see in the coming quarters, this growth could significantly accelerate upon a bitcoin resurgence. The Cash App appears poised to be a major beneficiary of that possibility, and perhaps one of the best ways to invest in the digitization of wallets, including bitcoin.Square's stock appreciated substantially so far this year, but the stock first reached this valuation in the summer of 2018. This two-year basing consolidation appears poised to break out here, and it makes sense that it would. Square's business continues to grow and current market conditions favor businesses with characteristics like Square has.Moreover, the business continues to grow, and its core customer base appears more resilient than the market average. Square's core clientele are entrepreneurs, and that is a group that will find some opportunity in almost any crisis.Further, the Cash App's importance is not being fully appreciated. The last time SQ shares traded at this valuation, the Cash App was generating almost no gross profit, but it made almost half a billion in gross profit in 2019. Given the unprecedented growth the Cash App has seen so far in 2020, it appears probable that Square will continue to please investors as it reports its next several quarters.(Source: Square Investor Update)It is peculiar to me that a company like Square has such low strike options, and especially considering the extended expiration dates that exist. You can buy options on Square that go out a significant amount of time compared to most equities. There are Square options that expire in September of 2022, or well over 800 days into the future. Despite this extensive time optionality, the highest strike price that currently exists is a mere $145.This is, to me, an unreasonably low highest strike price. Now, this is not some mathematical conclusion based upon Black-Scholes or some other conclusion, but rather what I believe is an inherently obvious peculiarity in the terms governing Square's available set of options. The set of Square option terms includes unusually long expiration dates and relatively low strike prices.It is very odd that, even though you can buy SQ options with expirations out almost 2.5 years, the highest strike price is about 45% above the stock's market value. For example, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) options have strike prices up to about 70% above current market price, even though expirations only extend to January of 2022. Similarly, the furthest out expiration date for options in Square's sizable peer, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), is the same as CAT in January of 2022, but the highest available strike price is about 60% above MA's current market price.As Square breaks out here, the only reasonable thing for the market to do is issue additional options at higher strike prices. The fact that there are not already higher strike price options available is likely an indication that the market is still wholly under-appreciating the possible move Square shares could have this year, and certainly in the subsequent two years. The absence of these higher strike prices will likely correct over the summer, as Square shares continue this break-out. As a result, the longer-dated and higher strike Square options appear to be undervalued. I personally like the September 2022 $135 strike, but almost all the LEAPS have a similar shimmer to them.Square performed poorly when the market sold off in March. As a high beta stock that is at all-time highs, it always has the potential to break down. This possibility is part of the reason Square options appear to require supplemental strike price issuances. There was no real expectationSquare is competing against behemoths in credit card and related bank transactions that will fight tooth and nail to maintain their market share. It is possible these companies will slowly destroy the profitability of these businesses in the attempt to keep them. Nonetheless, it is equally likely that one of Square's many larger competitors would attempt to acquire it, or possibly the Cash App.Square looks like it is starting to break out of a two-year consolidation base, as the market comes to appreciate both the resiliency of Square's core payment management system and the accelerated adoption of the Cash App. I believe Square's recent market outperformance is likely to continue through the summer. Moreover, I believe Square's existing higher strike LEAPS appear to present a significant opportunity to capitalize on the probable move coming in the near term, and possibly over the next several years."
4358675,71685,2020-07-15T15:30:18-04:00,Square's stock is a historically high valuations.Analysts have slashed their earnings estimates for the company.Options traders are betting the stock falls.,"Square (NYSE:SQ) has been on a big run higher, but its journey appears to be near its end. The stock's valuation has hit record-high levels, along with its price, despite analysts reducing expectations for gross payment volumes and lowering the company's earnings estimates.It is likely the reason why options traders are now betting that the stock declines in by the middle of August. It could also be why the stock is now starting to breakdown on the charts and shows signs of severe fatigue.The company is now trading with a one-year forward PE ratio of 127.2. That is the highest the ratio has been since 2018, and well above the equity's historical average of 78. It is an incredibly high valuation for a company that is expected to see earnings plunge by 66% in 2020 to $0.27 per share from $0.80 in 2019. True, earnings are anticipated to more than triple in fiscal 2021 to $0.95 per share, and then rise to $1.50 in 2022, giving the stock a compounded annual growth rate of about 23.3%, but a PEG ratio using that CAGR of 5.45. That is a very high PEG ratio, well above a fair valuation of 1.0 to 1.5.(Source: Refinitiv)The current earnings estimates are way down. Analysts on March 14 were looking for this company to earn $$0.93 per share in 2020, $1.31 in 2021, and $1.75 in 2022.(Source: Refinitiv)Meanwhile, gross payment volumes are forecast to fall by 10.5% in 2020 to $95.0 billion from $106.2 billion in 2021, and then rise by 21.5% in 2021 to $115.4 billion. The estimates for this year and next have also fallen sharply from $130.0 billion and $161.5 billion, respectively, since March 21.The sky-high valuation and weakening financial outlook for the business is likely why some traders are betting that the stock falls after it reports results at the beginning of August. In recent days, the open interest level for the August 21 $115 puts has risen by around 3,800 contracts. The data shows that these puts traded on the ASK and were bought for a price of about $5.40. It means a trader would need the stock to fall below $109.60 or 9.6% from its current price on July 15, around a price of $121.25, to earn a profit.The stock has now formed a bearish technical pattern known as a bump and run. It is typically a reversal pattern and suggests that the stock is likely overdue for a pullback. Based on the technical setup of the pattern, it seems the shares could fall to around $101.60. Meanwhile, the RSI is at an overbought level and, now, suggests that the stock reverse lower as well.There are obviously plenty of risks with Square and my point of view. The stock has been a big momentum trade, and that means that fundamentals, for the most part, could very well be out of the window for the foreseeable future. Momentum alone may carry the shares even higher, potentially back to around their previous around $130.But, given the big run-up, the valuations, and the chart, it is no wonder why some traders are at least betting on a reversal over the short term."
4356645,69905,2020-07-01T18:07:53-04:00,"I reversed my original passionate and bearish position and become a shareholder.Square has two segments, Cash App and Seller Ecosystem. Seller Ecosystem is the bigger of the two segments. But it's also growing meaningfully slower.Cash App accounts for approximately 33% of its gross profits, but it's growing at close to 100% year over year.I note why I believe investors could see the stock rally a further 40%-50%.","Square (NYSE:SQ) is a rapidly growing payment company. It has two segments, Seller Ecosystem and Cash App.Its Seller Ecosystem is on its way towards slowing down to approximately 20% gross profit growth rates, while its Cash App is growing at approximately 100% year over year.At first, this unprofitable enterprise appears hugely overvalued. But upon further analyzes, we can see that the stock could still rally a further 50% over the medium term to approximately $65 billion market cap, and only then, would it start to be more fairly valued.In essence, investors should understand that Cash App will grow and become increasingly more meaningful to Square, leading Square to be better understood as a rapidly growing digital wallet for consumers.I first went long Square on 15 May 2020. And pitched it to my Marketplace Deep Value Returns. Below is its performance since then.Data by YChartsWhat follows is an edited article from my Marketplace:For a long time, I was a value investor steadfast on not paying more than 6 times free cash flow.And as I regularly recommend you to do, I have been defining my circle of competence and expanding it. This has been reflected in my migration into certain growth opportunities while being determined not to overpay.Indeed, for a long time, I was bearish Square - and passionately, too. However, after reporting quarter-after-quarter how its Seller Ecosystem was rapidly deteriorating, I was noticing the potential of its Cash App and how the stock is still undervalued.Square has two very different operations. One which is struggling to sustain growth, and its second segment, Cash App, that is simply astonishing.First, let's focus on its Seller Ecosystem:Source: author's calculations, seller ecosystem revenueSquare's Seller Ecosystem are payment solutions aimed at Business2Customers (B2C). This unit, as you can see above, is nothing too impressive and appears to be struggling and slowing down amidst competition.These are payments that are often done via a swipe, a dip, or tap of a card. There are some elements online too via Square Virtual Terminal, or even the seller's website, but these are mostly 'high touch' services under intense competition.We can see in the graph that despite leaving 2019 with growth profits increasing 30% year over year, Q1 2020 was not as strong; just 18% increase in gross profits compared with the same period a year ago.What's more, the latter parts of March saw its seller GPV (Gross Payment Volume) come down 35% year over year.Note this figure is not revenue or gross profits, simply payment volume, but it's an indicator nevertheless that Square's Seller Ecosystem struggled in the later parts of Q1 2020.But you may retort, every business struggled in the latter parts of Q1 2020. Surely, this isn't so relevant?If we look back to Q3 2019, we can see that Square's Seller Ecosystem was up 26% and that Q4 2019 its gross profits were up 27% year over year.Put another way, it appears that the time when Square's Seller Ecosystem was able to grow its gross profits at 30% is now in the distance. If Seller Ecosystem couldn't get to 30% gross profit in 2019 when the economy was at its strongest, it's going to struggle significantly in 2020.To be clear, once we get past Q2 2020 and into the second half of 2020, Square's Seller Ecosystem is likely to bounce back, and Square's Seller Ecosystem still has a lot of potential in it.Indeed, I would not be totally surprised to see Square's Seller Ecosystem gross profits staying for a prolonged period of time growing at 20%-25%.Below, we can see Cash App's gross profits. Note, Square did not disclose Cash App's gross profits prior to Q3 2019.But Square now declares that the good indicator of future potential is reflected in its gross profit line. The rationale being that the fees it has to pay for exchanging bitcoin are too volatile, and this would mask the underlying opportunity here.Above, you can see the strong growth that Square Cash App is reporting.Indeed, Cash App is a peer-to-peer money transfer platform that allows users to send and receive money. Its main features are the ability to send, store, and receive cash. But the list of features keeps growing. It can be summarized as a pain-free service to transfer cash to friends, and one can even buy stocks through it.And what's compelling about the app is that the more familiar users become with it, the more they recommend other friends to join the platform, and trust starts to build towards the app. Also, the level of engagement with the payment app continues to increase, too.In fact, the figures for April show that Cash App is seeing user deposits 4X new direct deposits, compared with the same period a year ago.Indeed, CEO Jack Dorsey (who is CEO of Twitter (TWTR) too) notes that he believes that as consumers increase their habitual use of the app, the lifetime of the customer continues to increase. Even though it's too early to celebrate, and this spike could slow down once again as the economy reopens, thus far, this looks promising.Cash App's gross profits reached $183 million in Q1 2020. This puts its gross profits at 34% of Square's total gross profits. On the one hand, we should not expect Cash App's gross profits to continue growing at triple digits forever. However, on the other hand, we can certainly expect Cash App to continue to report close to triple-digit gross profit growth year over year.Cash App's back of the envelope calculations could reach $900 million to $1 billion of gross profits in 2020. Hence, Square's Cash App could go to reaching 50% of Square's total gross profits by the end of 2021.Dorsey has stated that even though Cash App is resonating very strongly with users, its ambition is to get bigger enterprises to adopt the platform to pay their workforce. For now, this is just an ambition, but it could become increasingly relevant as the world continues to digitalize.For now, Square will not work towards maximizing its profitability. Taking a strong market share in the e-commerce space is the only driver for Square.I'll repeat, readers should not at this stage pay too much attention to Square's lack of bottom-line profitability. This will come later. Indeed, I've often noted that having a founder with strong insider ownership leading the company can be quite rewarding for shareholders as this aligns the executive with common shareholders, and they are positively motivated to do everything possible to grow the value of their holding.For now, I consider paying less than 10x trailing sales to be a bargain opportunity for a company growing its consolidated revenues at north of 35%. Indeed, I believe that investors would be quite happy to pay around 12x sales for Square if it could continue to grow its top line past 2020 at north of 35%.Of course, this would depend to a significant extent whether there's a second wave and whether the economy would once again have to close down and for how long.On balance, I believe that close to $65 billion for Square is a reasonable valuation. This would put the stock trading at approximately 12 times this year's revenues.The main investment risk is that the multiple investors are paying right now could be too high relative to its long-term opportunity. I do not believe this to be the case, but it is possible that Square's strong growth would fizzle out, denting investors' confidence, causing the share price to sell off.Cash App has strong competition from Venmo (owned by PayPal (PYPL)), Zelle, and Apple (AAPL) Pay. Venmo is the strongest realistic competitor. And even though Square is growing at a very fast rate today, it may not be always the fastest. Any significant and prolonged slowdown would be a reason for concern to shareholders.The driving force behind this investment is its Cash App. If Square's Cash App can support Square's total revenues continue to grow its revenues at close to 35%-40% in 2021, this investment is very attractive.Cash App is growing at close to triple digits year over year and is resonating very strongly users, and there appears to be an influx of new users in April. The mobile payment system is very well positioned for our new normal 'low-touch' economy.Ultimately, I believe that this stock is still undervalued and could go on to rally another 40%-50%."

Even though Square has rallied up to over $130 per share, its forward earnings are not supporting that growth, with estimates for the forward 12-month period still down after being revised lower twice; peer PayPal (PYPL) isn't facing this situation, with 12 month forward earnings showing improvement.Square just broke into its first full fiscal year of profitability, posting $0.88 in EPS for 2019; TTM earnings through the first quarter of 2020 are sitting at $0.72. Q1 earnings were nearly three times worse than the year ago quarter, with a loss of $0.24 per share (compared to a loss of $0.09 per share) as Square felt the effects of higher operating expenses during the pandemic.Square looks to still be feeling the effects of the pandemic for the rest of the fiscal year, as the forward earnings estimate for 2020 fiscal year sits at $0.26 per share, representing a drastic 70.5% decline in annual earnings. A rolling 12-month forward estimate shows improvement off of that 2020 estimate, with that figure pegged at about $0.55 per share; although that is an over 100% recovery in earnings, it's still far behind 2019's actual earnings and the rolling 12-month estimate of $0.95 before the pandemic.Source: ORTEX AnalyticsEven though estimates are not completely accurate or indicative of the overall prospects of Square, the slow recovery after two heavy drops in forward EPS estimates point to a tough end to 2020; the effect to merchants using Square's platform and on CashApp is still hard to picture in the coming weeks and months as we could see some rather drastic changes to reopening measures. But what makes the estimates slightly worrisome is the discrepancy between the share price and forward earnings estimate trends - Square's current rally seems to be more focused on optimism, flocking to tech, or the longer-term resumption of the growth picture as opposed to the current performance of the underlying business in the coming 6 months.Compare this to PayPal's forward earnings estimates, shown below. Although PayPal's estimates started to slump throughout April, a solid Q1 earnings report and strong outlook boosted both share price as well as forward earnings. Whereas the 12-month forward earnings before the outbreak hovered around $3.40 to $3.50 per share, current forward estimates are now about 5.5% higher at $3.69 per share; as forward earnings estimates are rising, PayPal's rally up to over $180 is more justified than Square's rise to $130. Under these estimates for 2020, Square is trading at nearly 500x 2020's estimated earnings, and over 230x times 12 month forward earnings, while PayPal is trading about 52x 2020's estimated earnings and about 48x 12 month forward earnings.Source: ORTEX AnalyticsBut earnings estimates are just a small part of the picture - when looking at Square's EBITDA and levered FCF estimates, the potential for growth is still strong. Now although revenues are not expected to reach new quarterly highs until Q4 2020, annual revenue growth remains intact.Source: ORTEX AnalyticsEBITDA is on a fairly exponential trajectory, with 2020 estimated EBITDA of $177 million expected to double for the rolling 12-month forward period, and triple to $530 million by 2021. Levered FCF is expected to be nearly flat YoY from 2019 to 2020, but expected to jump up to $500 million by 2021, compared to 2019's $253 million.Although Square's earnings are expected to take a hit for 2020 and the forward 12-month period, leaving it trading at a quite lofty P/E ratio, Square is expected to be a powerhouse in terms of FCF generation and EBITDA growth. For Square, as revenues continue to grow, the key will be if the company can keep this growth in EBITDA and FCF - PayPal's FCF is nearly 10 times that of Square's and on a similar trajectory, and EBITDA is expected to bounce from $3.4 billion in 2019 to an expected $5.49 billion in 2020 and up to $6.7 billion by 2021.Whereas Square's P/E is slightly astronomical given the revisions to forward earnings and the strength of the rally since March, other underlying fundamentals like EBITDA and FCF growth back the strength of the business. The current phase of the market is one where valuations based on fundamentals aren't really that important anymore, and one where tech stocks are coveted due to the nature of the past two quarters. Names in e-commerce have been some of the market's best performers, like Wayfair (W) for example, whose fundamentals are quite terrible.But the atmosphere has changed rapidly within the past few months. Micro-merchants using Square's PoS technologies were not only affected by lockdowns, but by loss of traffic of prospective consumers due to those lockdowns as well as stay-at-home orders. And as cases continue to rise, more states/cities might continue to reverse reopening measures - such as Atlanta reversing back to Phase I measures over the weekend - which would potentially put consumers and merchants out of contact again.CashApp has been the primary beneficiary for Square, but can't be the only catalyst to rely on as share catapult higher. By combining money management - P2P payments, instant deposits, etc. with a usable Visa Cash Card, CashApp usage has surged and is expected to continue, with some analysts seeing Cash App as over half of Square's total EV.To conclude, don't underestimate the growth potential of Square based on fundamentals, or P/E alone. Yes, Square is outperforming its current and forward earnings potential, but the revenue and EBITDA growth will still continue. Square won't trade at these P/E multiples forever; earnings will recover, and P/E will fall back in line with historical numbers in the long-term. CashApp is a haven of strength for Square, but its core business of PoS tech will recover again with reopening, and Square's growth story can continue once more."

The company provides the hardware at low prices, and this is a customer acquisition tool that allows Square to expand into far more profitable businesses such as software and services. In addition to this, the company is building new growth engines with credit services and its digital wallet Cash App.With an estimated addressable market worth $160 billion and growing, the company is well-positioned for sustained expansion in the years ahead. Macroeconomic risk is a key factor to consider. However, at current prices, Square is offering abundant upside potential for long-term investors.Square started by providing access to debit cards, credit cards, and digital payments to small businesses and micro-merchants. The company provides the hardware at aggressively low prices, and then it makes big profit margins on payments processing.Even better, Square is leveraging on the opportunity to provide all kinds of software and services to an underserviced customer base. The software segment tends to be very sticky, generating recurrent revenue and attractive profit margins for Square.In addition to this, Square is expanding into credit services, and it has an enormously valuable source of competitive advantage in this market due to its access to all kinds of sales and inventory data from small merchants, which allows it make better decisions regarding credit risk and to provide a superior customer experience in comparison to other sources of credit such as banks.The Cash App digital wallet is also growing at full speed and with enormous potential going forward. Cash App gross profit grew 115% year over year last quarter, and the company is expanding into new functionalities such as investing in fractional shares of stocks and Bitcoin trading.Source: SquareBased on management estimates, Square has only penetrated less than 3% of its market opportunity in the seller segment and less than 2% of the market opportunity in Cash App. The company calculates that the total addressable market could be worth as much as $160 billion and with multiple growth avenues for the two segments combined.Source: SquareCorporate management is always an interested party in these discussions, so the size of the addressable market as estimated by management should always be taken with a big grain of salt. Nevertheless, it is easy to see that Square has enormous room for further growth in the years ahead.Square has delivered outstanding revenue growth over the years. Due to heavy investments for growth, the company has thin profitability on a GAAP basis, but it generates positive cash flows both at the operating level and at the free cash flow level.Data by YChartsImportantly, profit margins have been moving in the right direction over time, and the business model should allow for huge margins at the core business level. Payments processing, software, and digital wallets tend to have relatively fixed costs in comparison to revenue. For this reason, margins tend to expand as revenue grows over the years.Source: SquareSource: SquareMoving forward, sustained revenue growth in combination with a larger share of revenue being retained as earnings should provide a double boost to earnings growth in the years ahead.Square's stock is currently trading at a price to sales ratio around 7.3 times revenue estimates for the current year. This valuation is more than reasonable when considering the company's long-term growth opportunities.For comparison purposes, the table below shows some key growth and valuation metrics for Square versus PayPal (PYPL), Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V). There are many differences to consider, and the comparison is not completely straightforward.PayPal, Mastercard, and Visa are bigger and more established than Square, and they also have much larger profit margins. This could justify a higher valuation for these companies in comparison to Square. On the other hand, Square is far superior to the other names in terms of current growth and future growth potential, which would arguably merit a higher price tag for Square.In any case, it is fair to say that Square's stock is very reasonably priced by industry standards.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123On a forward-looking basis, the table below shows revenue estimates, expected growth rates, and the implied price to sales ratio for Square in the years ahead. Valuation levels in relationship to growth expectations are not excessive at all.Source: Seeking AlphaEven better, Square has consistently delivered revenue growth rates above Wall Street expectations in each of the past 12 quarters. If the company continues outperforming expectations in the future, such as it has done in the past, the stock would be even more undervalued than what current estimates are implying.Source: Seeking AlphaManagement has proven its ability to consistently execute and to build new growth drivers for the business by expanding its ecosystem. Optionality should provide plenty of opportunities for Square to continue outperforming expectations as long as management keeps leading the company on the right track.Square's stock has appreciated significantly from the March lows, but from a long-term perspective, the stock is still trading at levels it reached in August of 2018. This long sideways consolidation has allowed the company's growth rates to grow into its valuation, and now Square looks fairly reasonably priced in comparison to the company's growth prospects.Source: TOSWhen considering the risks, it is important to note that Square has big exposure to small businesses and restaurants in particular, and this is a particularly relevant uncertainty driver in the current environment.Economic uncertainty can also provide the proverbial wall of worry for the stock to climb higher as the economy goes back to something more similar to normal in the coming months, but it is still a major uncertainty cloud weighting on the stock in the near term.The sector is also very competitive, and Square will face growing competitive pressure from both financial services companies and technology players in the future. The company has solid competitive advantages, and the market opportunity is big enough for different competitors to do well over time. But investors in Square still need to keep a close eye on the competitive landscape going forward.Those risk factors being acknowledged, Square is a high growth business with enormous potential for further expansion. At these prices, the stock is well-positioned for attractive returns over the long term."

Both through Square Capital and Cash App, Square strengthen its position as a valid alternative to their local bank's branch both for businesses and individuals. Cash App numbers show a rosy future for Square's Q2 results and beyond.SourceAs a result of the anticipated impact from COVID-19, net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA were significantly affected by an increase in reserves for transaction and loan losses in future periods. How much of the $109 million will materialize is still unknown, but Square has moved smartly to mitigate damage. Through Square Capital, Square was approved as a lender under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA). As a result, Square Capital started distributing loans during the second round of funding for the PPP. This could be an important move for the overall business health, since part of the distributed PPP capital could go to the same businesses struggling to survive the two months of closure. Moreover, the PPP loans distribution will leave the Company with a nice profit (Figure 1).Source: Inputs from Jack Dorsey (NYSE:CEO) - Author calculationsSquare distributed over $500 million in PPP loans to over 60 thousand businesses. No fee is charged to the borrowers by Square, but the government is paying a fixed fee depending on the loan size:• ""Five (5) percent for loans of not more than $350,000;• Three (3) percent for loans of more than $350,000 and less than $2,000,000;• One (1) percent for loans of at least $2,000,000"".Source: Treasury.gov - SBAConsidered an average size of roughly $8 thousand dollars per loan, Square's revenue should total at around $25 million. The application process is highly streamlined, and these fees likely far exceed the costs of originating these loans. This is true especially for a technology-oriented company like Square, which has a straightforward application process and automatic processing tools.Moreover, the SBA, or ultimately the United States, guarantees 100% of the outstanding balance, removing credit risk from the deal.In this way, saving their small businesses customers could have made Square around $20 million in net profits. A win-win.On the other hand, competitors have taken a slower, stiffer approach. Retail banks have struggled to provide an easy and immediate application process for small businesses. Some of them put strict restrictions to limit volumes (Bank Of America (NYSE:BAC)), some were overwhelmed and shut their doors (Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC)), and others gently redirected requests to other lenders (JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)).Wells Fargo says on its website that:JPMorgan Chase says that it will only lend to businesses which had accounts with them as of February 15th, but also that they should maybe try with another lender:Bank of America, in addition to a checking account with the bank, demands no borrowing relationship with other banks:Square has taken a different approach and it is using this uncomfortable situation as an opportunity to show their value and build an even larger customer base. The Company, to date, has remained open to applications. They did not put restrictions on previous account relationships,and made the application process lean and easy online. This has allowed them to welcome business from other lenders, should they have been stuck in another bank's lengthy application process:Cash App helped individuals publishing straightforward FAQs on the stimulus program and instructions on how to get their money fast. As a result, Cash App numbers skyrocketed:From March to April, Square saw direct deposit volumes grow 300%, and in only one month the number of Cash App customers with direct deposit access grew from 3 million to 14 million.This increase in direct deposits is great on a profit point of view as well. In fact, Cash App generates revenue from 6 different sources:1. Instant Deposit2. Cash Card3. Business Accounts4. P2P transactions funded with a credit card5. Bitcoin6. Interest on customers' stored balancesFees from Instant Deposit take the first place in Cash App revenue generation sources ranking, and direct deposit customers have generated revenue which is multiples higher compared to customers who only use peer-to-peer.Cash App is now used for tax refunds, stimulus deposit, and work paycheck deposit. This makes the process of going to the retail bank branch obsolete, as downloading the app provides a valuable alternative. Also, as retail investing surged during the stay-home period, Cash App has allowed people to buy equities and bitcoin with widely accessible features such as fractional investing and recurring purchases.The approach used by Square Capital in the pandemic, together with the shift in consumer behavior, seems to have exponentially increased the digital bank's value compared to traditional retail banks. Cash App numbers have increased accordingly, and possibly setting the base for the digitalization of the retail banking sector.

4348469,105526,2020-05-18T11:24:02-04:00,"Square's top line proved resilient in Q1, though this was largely due to the rise in Bitcoin-related contribution.Earnings, on the other hand, disappointed as the company conservatively provisions for potential losses in the seller business.The stock still trades at c. 6x revenue in a recession, which seems far too optimistic.","There is a lot to like about the long-term Square (SQ) investment thesis, namely a long runway for growth, backed by a large untapped addressable market, as well as a uniquely charismatic CEO. However, I believe the company will be among the slowest to recover from COVID-19 headwinds, given its exposure to small and medium-sized businesses. Thus, though Square is well-capitalized, the significantly weaker April gross payment volume (GPV) trends, along with Cash App's growing dependence on volatile Bitcoin volumes, warrant caution. At c. 6x next year's sales, the stock may still be pricing in too much optimism; as such, I think investors should be cautious about buying in at current levels.Top-line results were roughly in-line with consensus as total net revenue reached $1.4 billion (+44% YoY), though this was primarily attributable to higher Bitcoin revenue. Specifically, acting as Bitcoin broker boosted Square's revenue by $306m in Q1, though only $7m fell to the gross profit line. Higher subscription and services revenue, along with Cash App resilience, also offset weaker-than-expected GPV growth.As expected, COVID-19 headwinds have disproportionately impacted the Seller side of the business, as card-present GPV fell 60% YoY in the last two weeks of March. Meanwhile, the Cash App business has been the bright spot, rising 98% YoY (ex-Bitcoin revenue). As a result, overall gross profit at $539 million (+36% YoY) was resilient.Source: Q1 Shareholder LetterHowever, the adjusted EBITDA of $9 million was well below consensus on increased transaction and loan loss reserves at $109 million (+35% YoY). I do acknowledge the case that these reserves should be excluded when evaluating the underlying Q1 results; however, I see the provisioning as a cost of doing business and, thus, have opted not to adjust for the change.Source: Q1 Shareholder LetterAs a payment processor, chargebacks serve as a leading indicator for potential losses in the seller business, and with current levels at ""less than"" 2x normal levels (as noted by management on the quarterly call), the severity of COVID-19 has clearly had a major impact. I also like that management is being conservative by provisioning at 4x normal levels, though this has certainly weighed on EPS at -$0.02 (vs. consensus estimates of $0.23).SQ also withdrew its financial outlook for 2020 but indicated that it expects to lower non-GAAP opex by $75mn to $125mn across product development, sales & marketing. G&A expenses will also fall short of its previous outlook for 2020 (which included $75mn in seller sales & marketing and a one-time step-up of $50mn in opex related to office expansion). With plenty of room to lower the cost base, I think Square should come out of the current situation profitably; the balance sheet is also robust with over $3 billion of balance sheet liquidity.Source: Square 10-QThe cost cuts should offset negative trends in Square's GPV, which was already down 39% YoY in the last two weeks of March. The decline would have been worse, but for improvements in card not present transactions (50% of GPV in April vs. 33% pre-COVID-19), which benefited revenue and margins. I would also highlight that seller GPV declines have continued into April at -39% YoY, driving an overall 45% YoY decline from end-March to mid-April.Amid COVID-19 headwinds, I would single out the Cash App outperformance, with total revenue reaching $528 million (+197% YoY). However, I would highlight the significant Bitcoin contribution in Q1 (58% of revenue) as a downside risk in upcoming quarters, as Bitcoin transaction activity tends to be volatile. In late-April, for instance, Bitcoin transaction fees surged 50% in anticipation of the ""halving"" event, though I see volumes subsiding now that the event has passed.Source: Q1 Shareholder LetterNonetheless, gross profit growth of 112% YoY in March (relative to double-digit seller GPV declines) was impressive. Thus far, April trends are signaling that the March performance was not a one-off, with new highs set across net new active accounts, Cash Card spending, and new direct deposit transactions. Encouragingly, management seems to agree, guiding toward an over 100% in YoY gross profit growth in April, though I think May trends will be a better indicator of the underlying (ex-Bitcoin/stimulus) momentum.Nonetheless, the traction shown by Cash App highlights the potential for it to serve as an ""alternative bank"" for Cash App users. Additionally, the low-interest-rate environment should continue to drive adoption in the coming quarters as the opportunity cost of holding funds on the platform decreases.Though Square currently trades at a discount to historical multiples at c. 6x revenue, I think Square's exposure to small and medium businesses, as well as the increasing dependence on volatile Bitcoin revenues, deserves to be discounted in the valuation. As such, I find the current multiple far too lofty to pay in a recessionary environment. In addition to Cash App-related growth disappointments, I think macro-related risks related to small business health and competitive pressures, especially in payments are also worth monitoring.Data by YCharts"

(NYSE: SQ), a financial-technology firm, which became publically traded in 2015.The thing is, when he founded Square, Mr. McKelvey knew very little about what he was getting into. He had been frustrated in a transaction he was trying to execute, and, due to this frustration, he began to look into the possibilities of how such a transaction could be completed in another way.Mr. McKelvey’s advice:This Is The World Of Radical UncertaintyThe world that Mr. McKelvey talks about is a world of radical uncertainty.In a world of radical uncertainty, we don’t fully know, let alone understand what is going on around us.This seems to be a little bit different that the uncertainty that Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Romer describes in the Wall Street Journal. Mr. Romer says simply: “Uncertainty is the overwhelming problem.” But, he is talking about a different kind of uncertainty.But, this is not the same uncertainty that Mr. McKelvey is talking about. This is not an uncertainty that deals with finding “an enhanced form of improbability” the uncertainty the entrepreneur is looking for.Why Start Something In A Recession?Mr. McKelvey admits that he is a contrarian. Therefore, starting a business at the bottom of a recession makes a lot of sense.Why start at the bottom? Well, for one, you may not be employed.Furthermore, “space is cheap.” And, it is easy to hire programmers. And, people are open to new ideas. In fact, they are looking for new ideas to resolve the problems they are facing.As far as risk analysis, Mr. McKelvey believes that “risk aversion is a secondary analysis.” You have to think about the timing and you take your focus off of the problems you are trying to solve.Finally, there are the people that don’t know what their problem is, what they need. And, because of all the disruption going on, their attention is focused elsewhere.And, it is a time for trial and error. If you are trying to solve a problem, you will not have to have the “best” application you can produce. But, with trial and error, you must keep working on it, version 2.0 or version 4.5 will fit the needs of the customer better.Oh, and what about money? Personally, I can’t believe all the emails I am getting announcing one conference meeting here and another conference meeting somewhere else. And, these are not cheap, fly-by-night organizations that are putting them on. Angel finance seems to be there. Venture capital seems to be there. Other interested parties seem to be there.What Is Going On All Around UsThe bottom line is that things are happening and that even more things are going to be happening.While others are worrying about getting consumers back out into the market and which plants should be re-opened, there are a lot of people out there trying to determine “what form of improbability” needs to be created. This is how the “new” era is constructed.Mr. McKelvey closes with:And, that is the world that we now find ourselves. A world of radical uncertainty in which we have little idea of what paths we are really following."
4347264,22148,2020-05-13T15:39:26-04:00,Square rallies near yearly highs after Q1 results.The company should report a large decline in Q2 payments volumes and an EBITDA loss.The stock trades at an insane 65x normalized EBITDA targets that are unlikely to be obtainable even in 2021.,"Despite the obvious long-term impact of the coronavirus to Square (SQ) small business customers, the stock is now back close to yearly highs. The company faces a tough road ahead with a material impact to business in the current quarter and a questionable future. My investment thesis was bullish on a rebound at the lows near $40, but the stock is no longer appealing above $75.The stock soared following Q1 results for multiple reasons and the primary one wasn't a good one. In Q1, GPV was only up 14% as payment volumes fell 35% in the last two weeks of March. Investors should expect an even worse number in April with a slow rebound going forward as many states haven't opened economies yet.The problem here is the net revenues surged 51% to $1.38 billion when excluding Caviar from 2019 results. Here again, my previous research had highlighted how the large transaction volumes from Bitcoin misrepresent revenue growth when not adjusted out of the financials.Source: Square Q1'20 shareholder letterIn Q1, Bitcoin contributed $306 million in revenues while only contributing gross profits of $7 million. These trading revenues were set up as virtually pass through costs with no intent to drive profits so these revenues are low calorie.In the prior quarter, Bitcoin revenues were $178 million while the numbers were a minimal $66 million last Q1 when the cryptocurrency was in the dumps. The YoY benefit to net revenues was $240 million. The benefit to the previous adjusted revenues and gross profits was basically $0.The traditional or more useful adjusted net revenues (thanks SEC) were $609 million in Q1 versus $485 million last year. Stripping out the transaction and bitcoin pass-through costs provides a substantially different view. Adjusted revenues only grew 25.6% over the last year with only two weeks in Q1 impacted by the financial crisis. The current quarter has already seen 6 weeks impacted suggesting payment volumes are likely to decline in Q2.The big problem always facing Square is the aggressive spending the company incurs to generate revenue growth. In Q1, adjusted operating expenses surged nearly $200 million to $532 million. The quarterly operating expenses were up $192 million or 57% from last year.While Cash App saw a big boost in usage with record direct deposit customers in April to offset the payment volumes, the financial numbers show the real impact to the business with the company seeing a big adjusted EBITDA reduction. Square took a massive hit here with EBITDA down as operating expenses grew far faster than some of the gross profit figures. The mobile payments company had guided towards EBITDA of $100 million in Q1 and only generated $9 million in positive EBITDA.Source: Square Q1'20 shareholder letterWhile clearly not the worst outcome in a tough market, the signs of the weakness expected in Q2 and going forward was the decision to cut $100 million out of ongoing expenses. Square doesn't expect a quick path to normalcy for their small business customers to actually cut costs for a company with the mentality of spending to grow.With 435 million shares outstanding, Square now has a market value of $32.6 billion. The stock was trading cheap when the stock dipped to $40, but the rally to $75 is stretched.The original EBITDA target for 2020 was over $500 million. The stock now trades at 65x original EBITDA targets for the year. The big question is whether Square gets back to those levels in 2021 with some of their customer base in the restaurant space likely never to return.The key investor takeaway is that Square had no reason to rally close to the yearly highs. The company should see payment volumes decline in Q2 leading to a substantial EBITDA loss in the quarter. The company has some appealing metrics in the Cash App segment, but those numbers appear to come at a high cost of additional sales and marketing expenses and can't overcome the weakness in the primary payments business.Investors should sell Square here at the highs and look for a better entry point when the reality of a weak Q2 hits the stock again."

The company also offers a peer to peer payment app geared towards individuals. Square has a strong competitive position in a large and growing addressable market. However, there is a current valuation disconnect as a result of near-term COVID-19 related disruption. In our view, this provides long-term investors an attractive opportunity with a positive risk-reward.Square was founded by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey in 2009. Jack Dorsey currently serves as the CEO of Square as well as Twitter (TWTR). The company went public in 2015.

These offerings help sellers accept payments, manage inventory, manage employees, enhance customer engagement, secure capital and create an online presence among other uses. The company processed $106 billion in Gross Payment Value (GPV) in 2019.Approximately 45% of the sellers had GPV of less than $125,000 as of December 2019. Sellers from food and beverage and retail industry account for 43% of total company GPV.Square Capital offers loans to merchants. The company then sells majority of these loans to institutional third-party investors. The Square Capital business adds to the company’s core offering by attracting new merchants and growing existing ones. In fact, Square recently received FDIC approval for a banking license.The Cash App ecosystem focuses on consumers through its mobile payments app “Cash App”. The app allows individuals to store and transmit funds as well as invest in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and equities. The company also provide a free Cash Card that works like a debit card but is linked to Cash App balance instead of a bank account. There were 24 million active Cash App users as of 2019.The company earns the majority (60%) of its gross profit from transaction fees charged to sellers as a percentage of total GPV. Gross profit margin of this segment is 37%. The rest of the gross profit is earned from subscription and services, Cash App, Square Capital and other software and services offered to sellers including instant transfer. This segment has gross profit margin of 85%. Revenue from Bitcoin has a gross profit margin of just 1.6% while the Hardware business yields negative gross profit margin of 61% as the company aims to make money via transactions and subscription activity and not hardware sales.The company’s raison d'etre is to better integrate the SMB seller (SMB is small- and mid-sized business) with modern payments and retail ecosystem. Typically, small- and medium-sized businesses were and still are ill-equipped to accept new age payments as well as use software to manage operations and customer communication. Square’s Seller services segment essentially provides the SMB sellers an opportunity to level the playing field to some extent. The Seller ecosystem has an addressable market of more than $85 billion in the U.S. alone and over $100 billion in additional TAM (total addressable market) opportunity exists in the form of current international markets ($16B) as well as new countries and products/services.Peer to peer payment apps such as the Cash App use technology to streamline money transfers and provide a user-friendly experience when compared to traditional banking avenues. As per the company, the Cash App ecosystem has a revenue opportunity of over $60 billion in the U.S. which is primarily made up of sending and spending money on the company’s platform. The market should see strong double-digit growth for the foreseeable future. Given the large addressable markets, the company’s penetration in Sellers and Cash App segments is less than 3% and 2%, respectively.While the addressable market is large and growing rapidly, the company will have to be on the top of its game in terms of execution as competition is formidable. While there are a number of players in the market, in terms of Square’s core opportunity, Shopify (SHOP) is the closest peer. Although they initially started with a different value proposition, their focus areas are increasingly overlapping as both companies try to expand their addressable market. Square’s roots are in offline store POS and payment offering while Shopify’s roots lie in SMB e-commerce. However, at present, both offer online store front services as well as integration and handling of transactions in offline environments. Those roots still color how businesses look at these solutions. Additionally, a key difference between Square and Shopify is also how they monetize their user base. Square’s universal POS solution only applies transaction-based pricing model, while to avail Shopify’s solutions, customers have to pay both monthly subscription fees as well as transaction fees. Finally, it is important to note here that Square is more versatile in terms of types of customers that can use its systems; however, Shopify tends to be restricted to traditional e-commerce/retail customers.Source: Company websites, Left Brain Investment ResearchBoth Shopify and Square’s volumes have been growing at strong double digits and the differential between their growth rates has been narrowing as evident in the chart below. Shopify’s growth rates have historically been higher than Square’s as the company benefits from both low market penetration as well as structural growth in e-commerce coupled with a lower base. Square’s gross payment volume was $106B in 2019 as compared to $61B of GMV at Shopify.In the Cash App business, Square faces competition from PayPal’s Venmo (PYPL), Apple Pay (AAPL), and Google Pay (GOOGL) (GOOG), among others. Generally speaking, there is less room for differentiation in the basic peer to peer transfer and storage of funds. However, companies are trying to differentiate by offering some additional features. For example, Square’s Cash App now allows users to also invest in Bitcoin and stocks. Square offers free Visa (V) debit card which is linked to Cash App wallet balance and with it comes Cash Boost, i.e., special discounts on spending through Square’s Cash Card. Apple and Google Pay compete based on their ability to use their core offerings to push their payment app penetration.Source: Company websites, Digital Trends, Left Brain Investment ResearchThe company’s revenue has grown at a 5-year CAGR of 39%. GPV processed by the company has grown at a 5-year CAGR of 31% from $35.6 billion in 2015 to $106.2 billion in 2019. The number of sellers has gone up 70% between 2015 and 2019 on a cumulative basis.Besides increasing market penetration for its existing services, the company has also consistently launched new products and services to grow its addressable market and increase revenue per customer. It has also started to focus on higher volume, mid-market customers, as opposed to its earlier focus on micro businesses. Indeed, Square has come a long way from the days its core offering was a single card reader device that would enable sellers to accept card payment from their mobile devices.Square Sellers Ecosystem Product/Service Offering Development:Square Cash App Ecosystem Product/Service Offering Development:Source: Square, Left Brain Investment ResearchCash App’s active user base has reached 24 million, up from just 7 million users in 2017. Square Capital has advanced loans of over $6.3 billion since its launch and $2.3 billion in 2019 alone while maintaining default rate below 4% in last 3 years (see 4th quarter shareholder letter).Cash App’s monthly active customers in December 2019 stood at 24 million, up 60% from 15 million users in December 2018. Also, the annualized revenue per monthly active customer excluding Bitcoin is now over $30 and has doubled from December 2017. Substantial growth in Cash App has led to increase in its contribution in company gross profit from 19% in Q4 2018 to 27% in Q4 2019 making it a meaningful contributor to the company’s overall business.Cash App started issuing free visa debit card called Cash Cards in 2017 which enables users to use Cash App wallet balance to pay for products and services. It also started to support Bitcoin trading in early 2018 and launched Cash Boost in May 2018 to increase engagement of Cash Cards through attractive discounts. In 2019, it began offering its users the ability to invest in equities and redesigned its interface to improve navigation and discoverability of app features.The company currently has operations and offices in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and the UK and aims to expand the offerings in these countries and enter new markets. The company has launched various solutions like Square Cards for sellers, Online Store, and Square terminal in the U.K., Australia and Canada in 2019. Revenue from international markets has grown at 3-year CAGR of 60% from $94 million in 2017 to $241 million in 2019. International markets account for just 5% of company revenue but opportunities remain immense. In comparison, Shopify, which operates globally in over 175 countries, derives 32% of its revenue from non-US markets.Along with the increase in the company’s seller base, gross profit per seller has also increased by 130% cumulative over the last 5 years. Gross profit as a percentage of GPV has remained stable within 1.03%-1.08% range during this time frame. The over 1,000 bps increase in gross margin as evident in the chart is due to operating leverage as well as rising contribution in total revenue from subscription and service-based revenue which has much higher gross margins relative to gross margin of transaction based revenue.Product development and G&A expenses have come down as a percentage of revenue. This has been partially offset by increase in marketing cost at Cash App mainly due to increasing free P2P transactions. The expense leverage together with higher gross margins have led to a strong improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin from negative 3% in 2015 to positive 9% in 2019.COVID-19 is likely to have a significant impact on the seller ecosystem. The company earns transaction fees based on the gross payment value processed at micro to mid-sized businesses which will be severely impacted from the decline in consumer spending during the lockdown as well as post-lockdown. The food and drinks industry and retail industry account for 43% of the company’s annual GPV while home and repair and professional services account for 25%. Although subscription and services-based revenue is expected to be less volatile, it only accounts for 40% of the company’s gross profit as compared to Shopify which generates nearly 60% of gross profit from its platform subscription and related services including domain name registration. Finally, a large portion of Shopify’s GMV is transacted online which is relatively speaking less impacted as compared to Square’s largely offline GPV. Due to these reasons, we believe Shopify’s business model is more resilient in these times as compared to Square.Square has updated the market on business trends post lockdown. On March 24th, Square announced that its total GPV was 25% lower in the trailing 10 days period on a YoY basis. The decline was more than 45% in large cities due to shutdowns. International markets GPV was also down by 40% during the same 10-day period. The company has revised its Q1 2020 gross profit guidance to $515-$525 million, down $35 million from previous guidance while still 30% higher than Q1 2019. Please note that Q1 just saw a couple of weeks of economic slowdown and Q2 is likely to bear the full brunt of it.The company is shoring up finances to create a buffer in case of longer-term lockdowns and a protracted slowdown. Square issued $1 billion of convertible notes in March 2020 to ensure sufficient liquidity. The company is also postponing go-to-market investments, pausing non-essential hiring and cutting down other discretionary expenses. Please note that the company had more than $2.1 billion in cash and short-term debt securities as of 2019, implying plenty of buffer already to weather a storm over the next few quarters.While we realize that a substantial portion of Square’s profit is driven by transactions (as opposed to subscriptions at Shopify), and that Square has a higher mix of offline sales (vs. e-commerce oriented Shopify), the valuation gap between the two has expanded to head-scratching levels as evident in the chart below. The valuation disconnect is especially puzzling as the company has added the Cash App revenue stream to its business which is becoming an increasingly meaningful part of the mix. The valuation discount is not just relative to Shopify but also Stripe (privately held, STRIP) which just raised fresh money from investors at a valuation of likely between 10 and 15 times revenue as compared to 5-6 times EV/sales at Square.Competing innovation: While innovation is the birthplace of Square’s growth story, it is also a potential threat. The company operates in the very dynamic payment enabling and processing industry which is seeing increased investment in new technologies and payment systems by both large companies as well as startups. As such, the company needs to move fast to create a competitive moat and scale around its businesses to fend off competition from new and existing peers.Credit risk from Square Capital: As mentioned earlier, Square sells the majority of its loan origination to third-party investors to mitigate risk; however, its inability to do so or changes in its business model in the future could significantly increase the credit risk and deteriorate the company’s balance sheet. The company’s solid liquidity position mitigates this to a large extent, in our opinion, for now.Economic weakness: We have already articulated our thoughts on the impact of the current COVID-19 crisis on the company’s business. Given the reliance on SMBs, it is important for investors to monitor this risk going forward.While we are cognizant of the risks to earnings power this year as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, Square’s long-term growth opportunity and its ability to monetize that opportunity remain intact. Additionally, the company’s stock trades at a significant discount to peers such as Shopify (read our recent Shopify article here) and Stripe (private market valuation). We have included Square as one of our top ideas (The Chosen) on our May list. As an investor, if you are willing and able to absorb volatility in the near-term, Square’s current valuation presents an attractive risk-reward."
4345696,105406,2020-05-10T11:04:23-04:00,"Square stock has experienced extreme volatility after the Company reported its Q1 earnings, falling 6% before rebounding as market opened.The Company has been severely affected by the pandemic in certain areas, but actually benefited significantly in others.The current stock price still presents a great opportunity for long-term investors.","Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has experienced extreme volatility after the Company reported its Q1 earnings, falling 6% before rebounding as the market opened. The Company has been severely affected by the pandemic in certain areas, but benefited significantly in others. Even if the fight with the virus has started with Square taking some losses straight on the chin, the Company is well-positioned and highly likely to come out victorious in the later rounds. The current stock price presents a great opportunity for long-term investors.SourceThe pandemic and its related closures have immediately put great pressure on Square's main revenue stream: transaction volume. However, the last Company report seems to be pointing to bad loans as the cause of the real damage.Square has been operating its loan program through Square Capital, leveraging point-of-sale data to obtain live insights on borrower business trend. While generally this allows Square to make better-informed underwriting decisions, in this quarter, we can see that it backfired. Unfortunately for Square, business data trends and related repayment affordability do not matter when the stores are forced to shut down. Figure 2 below shows graphically how bad these loan losses skyrocketed in Q1 2020:Figure 2 - Source: figure created by the Author with data from SquareThe loan losses are what tilted the Net Income per Share into negative territory at -$0.24, both lower than last quarter ($0.91) and the prior-year quarter ($-0.09).The short answer is yes. The balance sheet is strong, and the losses are set to normalize in the second half of the year.Square ended Q1 2020 with $3.4 billion in available liquidity, and on May 1st, it added $125 million in liquidity by entering into a new $500 million revolving credit facility. With the net loss for the quarter standing at $106 million, Square has a comfortable margin to endure an even longer pandemic downside.After getting caught in the bad loans' wildfire, Square is pumping the brakes. The Company temporarily stopped offering core flex loans and it's planning to put stricter criteria into place in Q2. This will help mitigate extra losses, on top of those already originated by issues loans, and will ensure that the bad loan bleeding will stop by the second half of the year.Square's business diversification has allowed it to pivot quickly and focus on the relevant opportunity for growth. One of the business segments experiencing growth is Square's Online Store segment (Figure 3). Although still relatively small, this distribution channel could start driving significant sales growth for businesses. Square is offering the service membership free, increasing the probability of customer retention even in a post-pandemic world. On the other hand, this allows to achieve a higher volume of card-not-present volumes and thus achieve higher margins.Figure 3 - Source: SquareSquare Capital has started distributing loans during the second round of funding for the PPP. In first-round PPP, banks would make 5% for loans of not more than $350,000; 3% for loans of more than $350,000 and less than $2 million, and 1% for loans of at least $2 million (Source). Considered that Square deals mostly with small business in need of financial support, it could generate around 5% revenue on a high volume of loans (probably in the tens of million $).Lastly, Cash App, as already discussed in my prior article, continues to increase its reach, building a strong foundation that will likely lead to accelerated growth in the second half of the year and beyond.The post-earnings volatility has split bearish short-term speculators and bullish long-term investors. It's easy to see the short-term pain generated by the pandemic, but looking a bit deeper, Square's underlying business trends are far from negative, and the balance sheet is strong enough to weather the short-term storm. The current stock price presents a great opportunity for long-term investors."
4349939,105308,2020-05-25T18:36:52-04:00,"Square's Cash App has seen explosive growth, expanding its ecosystem of services.My discounted cash flow valuation model suggests that shares have further upside.Square is a buy at its current price, despite shares rallying already.","For nearly two years, Square (NYSE:SQ) investors have seen their shares mainly trading within the $50 to $80 range. The stock has been struggling to stretch back to its all-time highs of around $100/share since its peak in Sept. 2018. In the meantime, however, the company has been consistently expanding both its financials, as well as its ecosystem of services. Driven by stellar growth in its Cash App, the company reported an exciting Q1 earlier this month. Despite shares rallying over the past couple of months, I can see Square going back towards $100/share and flying further beyond.In this article, I will discuss:Source: TechspotSquare mainly started by offering point of sale (POS) solutions to small businesses. I have scanned my phone numerous times to buy my morning latte in their stylized devices in the U.K., though the majority of the company's presence takes place in the metropolitan U.S. areas. In its letter for shareholders, the company stated that transaction-based revenue, for which Square charges a starting fee of 2.65%, was up 15% YoY. The segment was slightly affected by COVID-19 in the last two weeks of March but is still growing at an acceptable rate.Where the explosive growth for Square lies, is its subscription and service-based revenues. Excluding Caviar, to make for a fair comparison, this segment grew sales and gross profits by 72% and 74%, respectively. This was made possible primarily because of Cash App, which added its largest number of net-new transacting active customers. This is exciting news! Square is reliant on the success of small businesses, as they drive around half of the company's sales through transaction-based fees. The coronavirus forced many such businesses to shut down temporarily. On the flip side, it forced consumers to change individual behaviors and adopt in this stay-at-home economy, embracing Cash App's features, such as peer-to-peer payments.In fact, Cash App's popularity has been explosive, recently surpassing its competitor Venmo, despite the latter having the first-mover advantage, dominating the market for the past few years. The graph below illustrates each app's popularity based on its Google Trends analytics.Cash App recent explosive success can be attributed primarily to two factors:1. Square is targeting the U.S.'s most unbanked regionsThe image below, published by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, depicts the unbanked population rate for each state. While this goes back to 2017, it's safe to assume that the relative percentages amongst states should be around the same.Source: FDICGoogle Trends reveals that Cash App's popularity has been beating Venmo in around the same states the study of FDIC finds as the most unbanked. Square's strategy towards targeting this demographic is therefore successful.Source: Google Trends2. Square's genius marketing strategyAnother factor that has made Cash App viral is its social media promotion strategy. Firstly, the #CashAppFriday hashtag became viral on Twitter as the company literally started giving money away. Secondly, Cash App has partnered with many streamers on Twitch. Streamers benefit from receiving donations from viewers through the app, while Square grows its customer base the ""cool"" way. Transferring money is free for consumers, but Cash App charges businesses a juicy 2.75% to accept payment transactions.In my view, Square is smartly handling its ecosystem. The company is actively competing with Venmo, which is backed by the much larger PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and is succeeding. The Caviar sale was also a clever move, as the company unloaded the razor-thin margin company that may never become profitable for $410M.Overall, Square has been well-managed, driving revenue higher consistently. Many growth companies initially enjoy quick expansion in their sales that gradually decelerates over time. However, Square has been steady with the rate at which it increases its top line, currently at 43.1%.I think it's clear that for the past two years the company has made significant progress, despite its stock following a less exciting pattern. The question is, are shares moving higher, and if so, at which price should one buy?To find how much Square is worth today, I am going to use a discounted cash flow valuation model. I believe that is one of the better ways to measure Square's price, since free cash flow is what drives value in the long term. It's what could be potentially be distributed back to shareholders or reinvested by the company in the future. My initial assumptions are depicted in the table below.The issue that arises is that Square is border-line unprofitable. Therefore, cash flow from operations is not accurate, as it is mainly derived by depreciation and stock-based compensation. We will thus have to be a bit creative and determine Square's profitability based on its gross profits. Gross margins are currently around 40%. Since the company is almost breaking even, I am going to assume a conservative initial net profit margin of 6%. I believe that it is a prudent estimation that the company can achieve in the short term, considering its gross margins. Deducting its latest CAPEX of around $26M, we come out with a net income of around $300M [($5.14B*6%)-26M]. Now, operating cash flow should be a bit higher if we were to add depreciation and other factors, but I will stick with the $300M to be on the prudent side of things. The terminal growth rate is set at 2%.I assume that FCF then initially grows by 30%, and then gradually decelerates towards the terminal. I believe that, again, this a prudent assumption, reflecting a lower initial growth than Square's current sales growth.The model comes out with an intrinsic value per share of around $108, implying a 34% upside from Square's current price of $81. Square's current revenue growth is not showing signs of a slowdown, as I have assumed. Moreover, Square could potentially achieve much higher net profit margins than just 6%, resulting in an even higher stock price.Like with every other company, taking a position in Square comes with multiple risks. Firstly, coronavirus has slightly affected the company's Q1 results. However, the more significant impact will take place in the company's Q2 report. The company revealed that gross processing volume (GPV) was down 39% YoY during April. Considering the financial impact caused by the shutdown, many small businesses may find it hard to resume operations. This would adversely affect Square's top line.The company states another potential risk in its latest 10K related to its participation in the Paycheck Protection Program. Square has now exposed itself to uncertain risks as the requirements and processes of the program are still under development. Risks related to verification, forgiveness, and servicing loans may arise.Finally, Square needs to constantly be innovating and staying ahead of the product and marketing curves. Like PayPal fell behind to the momentum of Cash App, the same could happen to Square when it comes to future competitors. Keeping ahead of the competition will also be a costly process, as the company's current promotion strategies have been proven to be.The market has had mixed feelings for Square over time. Many have gotten excited about its future growth prospects, while others have called the stock over-hyped. Shares have traded mostly sideways for the past two years, but the company itself has grown into a diversified ecosystem of products and services. Sales have been hitting all-time highs by the quarter, raising the question of when will the stock eventually breakout.In my view, the market is starting to realize Square's value, causing the recent rally towards $81. According to the discounted cash flow model, and the company's underlying growth, I believe that the $100/share point is not far and should materialize sooner than later. I rate the stock as a buy at its current price.As always, thank you for reading. If you liked this article, please consider following me here on Seeking Alpha. Your support is much appreciated."
4348372,104941,2020-05-18T06:07:33-04:00,"Square's core Seller ecosystem will continue to drive strong growth for the company, and the advent of its status as an ""industrial bank"" will only bolster this growth.Cash App's precipitous rise to dominate the digital wallet landscape has supercharged the company's top line, and this digital wallet may eventually become worth more than its core business.I rate Square a Buy below at $80 and below.","Editor's note: This article has been edited to remove a factual error regarding Square Installments.(Source: Daily Mirror)Over the last decade, Square Inc.'s (SQ) success has been predicated on its Point of Sales system (henceforth referred to as ""Seller ecosystem"") that allows sellers to distribute their products, receive payments, manage employees, and analyze data related to the seller's business. In the last couple years, Square's Cash App has experienced an astronomical rise, and its existence further bolsters Square's position as the ""democratizing"" bank of the future.In that, Square's primary objective throughout its history has been to democratize banking and small business' access thereto. In the same way that Seeking Alpha and index funds have democratized investing, in the same way that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) have democratized advertising, and in the same way that Amazon (AMZN) has empowered individuals to sell on its platform, Square will continue this path of individual empowerment, i.e., democratization of banking and the access thereto.To this end, the company will be able to generate strong growth in the future via the business segments below:(Source: Medium.com)Today, I am going to highlight how these key segments will fuel revenue growth, resulting in an increase in share price for Square over time.Square has seen steady growth in its gross payment volume from its sellers since 2012. The company generates the majority of its revenue from its Seller ecosystem, in which it extracts transaction and subscription fees from those that use its software/hardware. In 2019, Square surpassed $100 billion in gross payment volume, as can be seen below.(Source: Statista)The company has been able to achieve consistently strong growth rates for this aspect of its business. However, the growth rate of the gross payment volume for Square won't grow by over 25% each year in perpetuity. Therefore, we should expect to see average annualized growth throughout the 2020s of approximately 17.5% (on an extremely conservative basis; currently in excess of 25%).Square's Seller ecosystem generated $356 million of gross profit from $853 million of revenue in Q1 of 2020. And with its extremely sticky ecosystem, we can expect the business to generate solid free cash flow margins of anywhere between 15% and 25% as Square continues to grow and earn fees from its sellers.With these metrics in mind, the Seller ecosystem market cap for Square is expected to grow to ~$130.5 billion by 2030, based solely on its current gross margin and a conservative assumption of its free cash flow margin, as well as the growth rates thereof.Square has made itself an indispensable asset for smaller businesses, as Square provides an all-in-one platform, as well as financing options for said businesses. Through Square Capital, the company offers its sellers' loans directly, which makes it extremely easy for companies to attain financing (in comparison to traditional means of small business financing). Square Capital employs data analytics and artificial intelligence by which it quickly and effectively assesses the creditworthiness of a borrower within its ecosystem.Square's access to this treasure trove of data on its businesses' financials gives it the ability to offer its sellers ideal loans that fit their needs as well as financial capabilities. In March 2019, the head of Square Capital Jackie Reses said in an interview that Square leverages data from undercapitalized businesses who use its software, such as salons and restaurants, to provide them loans more effectively.By providing businesses with the capital to grow efficiently and safely, Square benefits from its customers' growth. With the advent of its status as a bank, the company will generate even greater profits on these loans, which have been historically lent by third-party banks.(Source: Forbes)In March, Square had its application approved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Agency (FDIC) to become a de novo industrial bank and to operate separately as a direct entity of Square (Square Financial Services). A de novo bank is a newly licensed bank that is not acquired through purchase and is granted an ""Industrial Loan Company"" license. Square Financial Services will mainly offer loans through Square Capital to small businesses. The company will look to generate synergies between its newly established financial services arm and its Seller ecosystem so as to drive their client's businesses ever forward and, in turn, drive Square's revenues and free cash flow ever higher.In the fourth quarter of 2019, Square Capital distributed 97,000 loans for $671 million, a 42% increase from the prior year. If Square can establish its own bank (the chart approval is a major step in the right direction), it will be able to provide loans for its sellers through its installments program and capital services, thereby ""disintermediating"" fees and interference from its traditional third-party loan providers (while, to be fair, also assuming the risk of these loans).For now, Square will continue to work with its third-party loan providers; however, by 2021 or 2022, Square Financial Services should be fully up and ""loaning"".(Source: Square Q4 2019 Shareholder Letter)Square has been working on increasing its large sellers' growth over the past few years, since these will result in the most consistent revenues, and hence, free cash flow. From June 2017 to June 2019, the company was able to increase its sellers of $500,000 or more by 7%.As can be seen below, Square has steadily increased the number of larger companies in its ecosystem, and this trend is only set to continue.This signifies that Square is helping its businesses grow, and this, in turn, accelerates the rate at which the company itself grows.(Source: Medium.com)As I've mentioned previously, Square's objective since its inception has been to empower individuals who've often been left out of the financial system. That is, it has striven to democratize the financial world.With this in mind, it's only logical for the company to develop a consumer-side platform on which democratization and empowerment can take place.Enter: Cash App.What does Cash App do?These capabilities make Cash App highly appealing, and this is evidenced by the increase in monthly active users.(Source: ARK Invest)As can be seen above, Venmo (PYPL) was able to get a head start, but Cash App has come to dominate the landscape in terms of annual downloads.(Source: Atlas)Cash App has been growing at faster rates than Venmo since 2018. Venmo last announced that it was running at an annual revenue rate of $400 million annually, while Cash App is currently running at a rate of $528 * 4 = ~$2 billion. This can be attributed to Cash App's astronomical growth since 2017 as well as its focus on digital currencies.(Source: Square Q4 2019 Shareholder Letter)Over the past 3 years, Cash App has tripled its monthly active users and doubled its growing revenue per active user. In Q1 2020, it generated $528 million of total net revenue and $183 million of gross profit.Employing the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, we could expect Cash App's market cap to increase to reach a staggering $239 billion by 2030. Now, this may seem unrealistic, but one must consider that Cash App is on track to do $2 billion in revenue this year with 35% gross margins, while growing in the triple digits.(Source: Square Q4 2019 Shareholder Letter)Therefore, one might already assign a valuation of $20-40 billion.Cash App released its Cash Card in 2017, which is a free debit card that connects to your Cash App balance. The Cash Card can be used anywhere that Visa is accepted in the U.S. and charges businesses 2.75% for every transaction.Cash App has been able to utilize its debit card by teaming with chains and restaurants, such as Chipotle (CMG), Starbucks (SBUX), Xbox (MSFT), and Dunkin' Donuts (NASDAQ:DNKN) to offer discounts. This has been a key driver to Cash App's growing revenue.With 27% of Square's gross profits coming from Cash App in the fourth quarter of 2019, the app will continue to grow rapidly over the next few years, and the company will look to capitalize on this explosive growth. It will do this by bringing together businesses and individuals through the Seller ecosystem and Cash App software.Here's an example of how these two could be brought together: Square could employ data analytics and location tracking to offer discounts at local Square Sellers to individuals using Cash App in the same area.The opportunities here are massive, but it will all be contingent on Jack and his team's ability to execute.Now that we've discussed the quality of Square's business, let's delve into what you should pay for the company.So let's begin!L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelTo determine a fair value for Square's business, we will employ our proprietary valuation model. Here's what it entails:Now, let's check out the results!Assumptions(Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation Model)According to the LASV Model, Square is slightly overvalued on an extremely, extremely conservative basis.Now, let's check out what we should expect in the way of annualized returns over the next decade.(Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation Model)As can be seen above, one can expect well above S&P 500 returns buying the stock at $80, and therefore, I rate Square a buy.Square has developed a coveted platform on which businesses can grow and access vital resources. Square's Seller ecosystem has made it easier for businesses to sell their products, and the company will continue to generate income from new and previous partners, who will continue to grow due to the support they receive from Square's powerful ecosystem, which has been made even more powerful since the advent of its status as an industrial bank.While the company's first product will mature, i.e., the Seller ecosystem, Cash App will prove to be a significant growth driver for the long term as revenues and users continue to grow rapidly.With a 17% return over the next 10 years, Square is undervalued right now, and I recommend a Strong Buy given more than twice the expected return of our 9.8% hurdle rate.As always, thanks for reading, follow for more and happy investing!"
4336149,102764,2020-04-06T07:57:02-04:00,"When facing a recession and a bear market, investors need to find the right balance between controlling portfolio risk and capitalizing on opportunities.Square will be materially hurt by the recession, since the company serves mostly small businesses and micro-merchants.On the other hand, Square has an outstanding business model, a smart management team and enormous opportunities for growth in the long term.Short-term uncertainty is creating a long-term buying opportunity in Square.","We are going through exceptionally risky and uncertain times in the market. In this environment, it is more important than ever to strike the right balance between managing overall portfolio risk and capitalizing on opportunities to buy high-quality businesses trading at attractive valuations.Square (SQ) has a lot of exposure to small businesses in general and restaurants in particular. The impact of the recession will be material, no doubt about that, and it is hard to tell what will happen to the stock price over the days and weeks ahead.However, when looking at the big picture over the middle and long term, there is a considerable chance that Square stock will deliver compelling returns over the next 12 months. Even better, in a 3-year time horizon, the probabilities are that Square stock will look like a huge bargain at current prices.The recession produced by the coronavirus pandemic will probably be deep and broad-based. If we do things right, maybe the duration of the recession will be relatively short, but it is still too early to quantify the overall economic impact.Things could easily keep getting worse before they get any better, and it is important to understand the overall risk management framework before getting into the specific details of Square as a position.Personally, I was holding 50% of my portfolio in cash because there was too much complacency in the market back in February before the crash started. As prices declined steeply I increased my exposure to 70%, and then I reduced positions again during the market rebound.As of the time of this writing, I am holding 55% in stocks and 45% in cash, so I have abundant dry powder to continue buying stocks at lower levels if the market makes another leg lower. In addition to a large cash balance, I will consider some hedging positions via futures and ETFs if the market conditions merit some additional protection measures.The main reason why I am making these disclosures is that the overall risk management framework is of utmost importance in a bear market. It is one thing to say that you bought Square and you still have 45% of your portfolio in cash versus being 100% invested and with no additional cash to invest.Square is an outstanding business with enormous potential for growth, but the company is going to feel the pain from the recession, so buying Square right now means that you will be exposed to significant risk and volatility in the near term. Keeping your overall portfolio risk under control makes a big difference in terms of being able to tolerate this uncertainty in exchange for superior upside potential.Payment processing is a remarkably profitable business that is dominated by a few large players on a global scale. But Square identified an underserved niche in small businesses and micro-merchants, and the company became a leader in this segment.Even better, Square has consistently expanded its relationships with clients with new offerings in areas such as financial services and credit, marketing, inventory, and payroll management.Square sells its hardware at low prices, and this is mostly a customer acquisition tool. Once the customer is on board, Square can broaden its presence into all kinds of services and software applications. These businesses are quite sticky, meaning that it is notoriously difficult, expensive, and risky for a client to leave Square and switch to another provider.Since Square is focused on traditionally underserved clients, each new service offering makes the ecosystem increasingly attractive for those clients, creating a powerful flywheel that attracts even more clients and creates more cross-selling opportunities over the long term.Not only that, but Square capitalizes on its data to make better business decisions. Having access to sales and payroll data from its customers, the company can make credit decisions in a much faster and more effective way than the competition.Square is following the same playbook with its digital wallet Cash App, as the company keeps adding new functionalities such as the possibility to invest in fractional shares of stocks and even buying Bitcoin. Square reported 24 million Cash App monthly active customers as of December 2019, is up from 15 million in December of 2018, so this business is clearly growing at full speed.Management is executing well, and Square is both consistently gaining new customers and making more revenue per customer, which is driving sustained growth in gross profit over time.Source: SquareSquare is aggressively investing for sustained growth, which obviously hurts profitability in the short term. However, the main profitability metrics have been moving in the right direction in the past several years.Source: SquareThe company's financial performance will clearly take a hit in the short term. At this stage, it is practically impossible to tell how large the hit will be and for how long the slowdown will last. However, it is important to acknowledge that the business model allows for attractive profitability at the core business level.In areas such as payment processing and software, most of the costs are relatively fixed in comparison to revenue. Once the software has been developed and the technological infrastructure is in place, every new customer has almost zero marginal costs, so profit margins tend to increase over time.Marketing and R&D expenses are a different consideration, and Square is making big investments in these areas. But the key point is that these investments are planting the seeds for sustained growth in the future.The payback period measures the effectiveness of sales and marketing spend, and it's calculated as the number of quarters for a seller cohort's cumulative gross profit to surpass the sales and marketing expense in the quarter in which the cohort was acquired.Square's payback period is generally less than four quarters, which indicates that management is doing the right thing by aggressively investing for sustained growth, and those investments are being rapidly recovered by the company with the profits produced by the new customers.Management estimates that the total addressable market could be worth as much as $100 billion in sellers and $60 billion in individuals. Besides, Square is barely scratching the surface in terms of international expansion, and this could open the door to outstanding opportunities in the future.If management keeps playing its cards well, Square should benefit from gargantuan opportunities for growth over the middle and long term.Square stock has declined by nearly 50% from its highs of the year, and the price to sales ratio is looking quite attractive by historical standards. Nevertheless, and depending on how long the recession lasts, it is not impossible to envision a scenario in which the stock continues going lower.Data by YChartsThe company has already cut guidance for the coming quarter and it withdrew guidance for the year. It is interesting to note that the stock reacted positively after these announcements, indicating that the impact anticipated by management is not as bad as the market was fearing. But we still need to acknowledge that it is hard to know what kind of performance Square can produce over the coming months.The stock market hates uncertainty, and there is plenty of uncertainty surrounding a company that serves mostly small businesses and micro-merchants in this economic environment. The main question for investors, however, is to what degree this uncertainty is a permanent factor versus a transitory reason for concern.There will be some permanent damage, for example, some small businesses will not be able to survive the crisis. However, it is fair to say that most of the economic impact will be transitory by nature. This too shall pass, and the U.S. economy is going to recover from the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Even if there are new waves of contagion in the future, we will be far better prepared in terms of reacting rapidly and taking the necessary measures to slow down the spread. Drugs, treatments, and potentially vaccines could be a game-changer in this area, and the healthcare system will have more capabilities and resources to deal with the crisis.Investing is always a game of probabilities as opposed to certainties, because the future can never know, only estimated. Importantly, risk should be actively managed, but avoiding all risks would mean that you are also missing on the massive opportunities for wealth creation that the stock market provides over the long term.In the case of Square, there is a lot of uncertainty weighting on the stock in the short term, but the probabilities are that this uncertainty will generate an exceptional opportunity for long-term investors in the company over the years ahead."
4339804,104398,2020-04-24T12:10:59-04:00,"Cash App generated $1.1B of revenue in 2019 (+157% Y/Y).The existing addressable market is estimated at $60B.The platform has strong unit economics and is highly scalable.Acquisition, monetization and retention have been spectacular.25% of Square's gross margin comes from Cash App in 2019 (vs. 6% in 2017), and it could propel the company's valuation much higher.","Many investors first think of Square (SQ) as a POS (point-of-sale) system for small brick-and-mortar merchants, and I don't blame them. Square solutions are easy to identify in our day-to-day lives, with their contact-less chip readers and quick-checkout tools. ""Sidecar payments"" were the primary source of gross profit for the company back in 2016.Today, software solutions (back office, online selling) and integrated payments are the main drivers of the seller business. Square Capital (quick business loans) and Square Card (free business debit card) are also having a growing impact on the business.Square's seller ecosystem is heavily reliant on SMBs. And the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted many analysts to raise the alarm and point to a potentially very challenging year for Square with many small businesses seeing their activity and transactions dry up.But the fastest-growing segment in Square's gross profit is one that targets an entirely different ecosystem: individuals. The product behind this growth is a platform called Cash App.Square launched its Cash App service in 2013. At the time, the focus was to compete with services like Venmo (owned by PayPal (PYPL)), Apple (AAPL) Pay, and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) Pay.At first, Cash App was just a P2P (peer-to-peer) payment service. Today, the platform has evolved into an all-in-one digital wallet combining a free debit card, cashback offerings, direct deposits, and now stocks and bitcoin investing.The Cash App ecosystem is often overlooked by investors focused on the seller ecosystem. But I believe it's about to become the main catalyst for future growth, and it could be the platform that will help turn Square into a much bigger company in the coming decade.Let's review why.SourceDon't take it from me, but from the reputable research firm ARK Investment Management.Cash App is closing in on Venmo and could come ahead at some point in 2020.SourceThis is also evident based on Google Trends, as reflected below. Cash App is now well ahead of Venmo in searches, and it has been the case for months.SourceThe most recent ranking released by Sensor Tower also shows Cash App as the fourth most downloaded fintech app in the world (up one rank from January to February). Cash App is in very good company between PayPal and Alipay (Note: PhonePe is an Indian e-commerce payment system and digital wallet company) .SourceLet put Cash App in context with Square's FY19 numbers.Square has seen impressive growth since going public in 2015.Data by YChartsIf we look at the breakdown from management in their most recent investor update, Cash App was 25% of Square's gross margin in FY19. That compares with 6% in 2017 and less than 1% in 2016.SourceAnd the momentum is accelerating. Square disclosed that Cash App was 27% of the company's gross profit in the most recent quarter ($144 million).SourceBased on the trend over the past three years and the recent momentum, it's only a matter of time before Cash App becomes the dominant source of gross profit for the company.Square has broken down its total addressable market as follows:SourceThe implication is that the runway ahead is larger for Cash App given that its run rate of $1.1 billion revenue in FY19 implies less than 2% market penetration.Management is breaking down this $60B+ opportunity into three categories:SourceAnd Cash App's market opportunity doesn't stop here. Over time, new products and use cases are likely to emerge. Cash App could become an all-in-one solution, targeting new areas such as lending or wealth management.SourceCash App is making money on all three categories it targets:SourceCash App really shines when it comes down to the variety of its revenue streams. The additional use cases developed since 2016 have created new avenues for growth that have stacked on top of the existing ones.SourceTo get a sense of the user base, what we usually refer to as MAU (Monthly Average Users) on social media platforms is referred to as MTA (Monthly Transacting Actives) for Cash App. It is defined by Square as ""a Cash App customer who has one cash inflow or outflow during a given monthly period.""The number of MTA has gone parabolic for Cash App, from 3 million in 2016 to 24 million in 2019.To measure a user base, a monthly metric is obviously much more valuable than a yearly one. When PayPal revealed that Venmo had 40 million active users in 2019, that number included 12 months of transactions.What is even more interesting than the active user base of Cash App is how user engagement has grown just as fast.The number of DTA (daily equivalent of MTA) has grown 80% Y/Y in Q4 FY19, which is even faster than the MTA. The implication is that not only are more users using the app, but they are doing so more frequently.SourceCash App has obviously proven that it could find and grow an audience very fast. Now, volume matters only if the unit economics are promising. And, in my view, this is where Cash App shines the most.Revenue per customer has reached $30 annualized revenue per monthly active customer in 2019, a double from 2017 level. SourceIt gets more interesting when we analyse specific cohorts of users. Management gave shareholders a unique look into how fast they can recoup their user acquisition spend, using the example of the June 2017 cohort:This means a return on investment of more than 5x after 2.5 years. And this cohort is obviously going to continue to generate revenue.SourceThe implication for such a strong return on investment shows in the financials of the company. Yearly gross profit by cohort has been expanding and cohorts of users are stacking. This is the true engine behind Cash App's meteoric rise.SourceNot only is Square increasing its ARPU, but also its conversion rate. According to management, 50% of Cash App's quarterly users generated revenue in Q4 FY19. The high engagement within the ecosystem is what's driving the lifetime value per user higher.SourceConsumers are willing to pay for convenience more than ever before. We increasingly expect everything to be handed over to us in a way that is simple, frictionless and all-in-one place. Be it for shopping, delivery, travel or entertainment, this has naturally contributed to the rise of digital wallets.Cash App screenshot from Google Play store (Source).With innovations like Cash Boost (instant cashback offer with specific brands) and Cash Card, Square has rewarded stronger engagement within its ecosystem.At the end of the day, the Cash App Ecosystem is meant to replace the need for a bank account. The long game is not to take market shares from Venmo, but to gain shares from the entire banking and wealth management industry.Last month, the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) granted Square conditional approval to open a bank. Named Square Financial Services, the bank will open next year and will offer small business loans. There will be natural synergies and complementary features that could overlap between the seller and the Cash App ecosystem.Another obvious area for future growth is the expansion beyond the US. Cash App is still a US-focused product. But Square has proven with its seller ecosystem that it can expand beyond North America when the time comes.Square is likely to continue to scale user acquisition, and in return create organic growth via word-of-mouth as the existing community grows. With new users coming on the platform adding fuel to the fire, the existing very strong unit economics will continue to drive Cash App's importance in Square's gross profit expansion.SourceBeyond what we know today, what remains the most exciting feature of Cash App is its optionality.Acquisition, retention and monetization could expand even more over time with new use cases. Given how engaged existing users are, it's easy to see how future features could find success and further expand conversion and ARPU.Lending and personal finance are obvious areas that Cash App is likely to target over time, and I can't wait to see more."
4336270,71685,2020-04-06T15:32:49-04:00,"Square's stock has rallied along with the broader equity market.The options market is now suggesting that the stock re-test its March lows.Additionally, the technical show a strong downtrend is in place.","Square's (SQ) stock has been pummelled, and now, traders are betting the stock drops back to its recent lows in the weeks ahead. The stock is suffering along with many others from the prospects of an economy that is being impacted by the declining conditions as a result of the coronavirus. As the economy slows and shuts down, it seems natural that consumer spending will slow materially, and that is likely to affect Square's future revenue and earnings power negatively.The company lowered its first quarter guidance on March 24 and noted a significant decline in gross processing volume for sellers of more than 25% year over year in the final days of March. On March 31, Visa (V) cut its guidance for the second time. Meanwhile, on March 24, Mastercard (MA) reduced its guidance for the second time and pulled its full-year guidance. The weakness in these two payment processes confirms the weakness in consumer spending.Square now sees first quarter revenue of $1.30-1.34 billion from previous guidance of $1.34-1.36 billion. The company not only lowered its guidance but also increased the range, suggesting the visibility into the final weeks of the quarter was diminishing. Additionally, the company pulled its full-year 2020 revenue guidance from what had been a range of $5.90-5.96 billion.As a result, analysts have cut their first quarter revenue estimates to $1.306 billion. Meanwhile, forecasts for the second quarter have fallen by roughly 21.3% to $1.167 billion. But despite the sharp drop in second-quarter revenue, analysts, currently, see the potential impact in the third and fourth quarters as less severe, lowering third quarter estimates by 12.9% to $1.355 billion, and by 8% in the fourth quarter to $1.465 billion. But given the steepness of the declines the economy recently has seen and the surging unemployment, those revenue estimates may be too high.The weak economic landscape and the potential for further revenue estimate reduction are likely reasons why traders are betting that Square's stock will decline further in the coming weeks. The open interest for the $42 puts for expiration on June 19 increased by nearly 4,200 contracts on April 6. The puts were traded on the ASK, indicating they were bought, and is a bet that the stock declines. The trader paid about $6.25 per contract, and that means the equity would need to fall to around $35.75 by the expiration date. It would amount to a decline of about 25% from the current stock price of $47.85 on April 6.The stock has been in a steep downtrend since the end of February and, technically, looks very weak. That downtrend should serve as a healthy level of technical resistance, which could result in the stock retesting its recent low around $36.50, which is a decline of about 23.7% from its price on April 6.Should the stock rise above the downtrend, it would be technically bullish. It could result in the stock rising to around $56.25, an increase of about 17.5% from its price on April 6. Additionally, at this point, it is tough to tell just how long this economic slowdown may last. It is entirely dependent on the length of time the coronavirus continues to spread or that it remains a risk to the public health. Should the coronavirus abate sooner, it could result in the economy and Square seeing a surge in growth; if it lasts longer, it could drag revenue even lower.At this point, everything in the economy, the stock market, and Square are fluid with obvious risks and several uncertainties."

Avoid this investment, here's why:I've been bearish this stock for a considerable amount of time:Without picking the top, but simply picking my initial coverage here's the performance:(source)Objectively, I have absolutely no doubts that Square will continue to prosper.In fact, not only do I very much respect and admire CEO Jack Dorsey and his team, but I believe its two platforms both solve friction points for customers and both platforms are highly sticky. Find me inconsistent?You should not. My thesis is contingent on its valuation versus both its growth rate and its unimpressive profitability profile.Specifically, we can see that its growth rate is consistently declining: (Source): Author's Work, Unquestionable Slowdown, Avoid This. ***excluding Caviar (divested business)This was Square's total revenue growth rate before COVID-19 forced Square to pull its 2020 guidance.Accordingly, we know now that its growth rate will be substantially below the 30% growth rates previously guided when compared with 2019 (shown above).For clarity, below are Square's two segments:(Source): Investor PresentationAs it stood at the end of Q4 2019 its Cash App accounted for 27% of total gross profit, up from 25% for 2019 (shown above).Meaning that the pace at which Square's Cash App is growing, Cash App is rapidly becoming a larger portion of Square's total gross profits.Indeed, Square notes in its update that Cash App's gross profit had grown 118% year over year in January and February 2020:Source: author's calculations, press statementsNote that Square states, that COVID-19 only started impacting its business starting in March 2020.Consequently, even before COVID-19 having any significant impact on its transaction, Square's crown jewel was already reverting back to the pace we witnessed in Q3 2019. Furthermore, the figures above are year-over-year, so this removes any impact from seasonality.Again, Square's biggest segment, its Seller Ecosystem segment has been decelerating for some time:Source: author's calculationsNote, I'm not arguing that Square's Seller Ecosystem was rapidly decelerating, simply noting that it was trending down from the highs of 2017-2018.Square's market cap at $23 billion simply leaves investors with too little upside and too much downside for three reasons:1) As discussed above, Square's consolidated revenue growth rate continues to steadily decline. Even though its Cash App is growing at a very strong clip of triple digits, this is going to meaningfully contract as a result of the global recession.2) Square's Seller Ecosystem accounts for approximately 75% of Square's gross profits. Consequently, even if Square's Cash App posts strong growth, its performance will be out shadowed many times over by the performance of Square's Seller Ecosystem.3) We have absolutely no tangible evidence of Square's actual ability to turn a clean profit once we account for its heavy stock-based compensation. Here are the maths: Square's free cash flow in 2019 was $400 million. Of that, its stock-based compensation reached $300 million in 2019, meaning that actual 'clean' free cash flow was approximately $100 million.Paying approximately $23 billion market cap for Square's $100 million of clean free cash flow implies that the stock trades for 230 times free cash flow. Going into a global recession that is no way aligned with a rewarding investment opportunity.4) Even if we disregard Square's actual ability to generate free cash flow, under the premise that Square is not intent on maximizing free cash flow at this point in its operations. Even solely focusing wholeheartedly on its adjusted EBITDA figures for 2020, that we know Square has stated it will now miss.Square was expecting its 2020 adjusted EBITDA to reach the midpoint of $510 million. Even with this 'hypothetical' adjusted EBITDA figure, Square was still being priced at 46 times forward figures.Even before COVID-19 and the global recession, Square was already showing signs of slowing down its revenue growth.Even before this devastating impact on our global economy, Square was trading for 46 times forward EBITDA figures.Now, with the economy abruptly closing its doors at numerous, if before it was expensively priced, it is now even more expensively priced as Square cleanly notes that it will miss its 2020 guidance. Avoid this stock for now."

As the economy reopens and new business trends develop, I believe Square could pick up its growth rate at an even faster pace.Square's downfall from $85 to the low $30 was fast, maybe excessive, but justifiable. In fact, Square’s biggest business segment, the Seller ecosystem, relies extensively on small businesses that were forced to shut down for several weeks due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on the company's recent updates, the damage in Q1 amounts to a decline in Gross Processing Volume (GPV) of more than 25% year over year for March. Pre-COVID-19, in January and February, Seller ecosystem gross profit grew 32% year over year. Based on this data, we can run the numbers to estimate the net outcome weighting on the Seller ecosystem:Figure 2 – Source: Author calculations based on Square Press releaseFor January and February, I estimate revenue growth of around 32% (gross profit and revenue rate is constant historically), while for March a decrease of 35% (derived by a volume decline of 25%+ as per company’s update). This leaves a year-over-year growth of 10% in the transaction-based revenue.Considering 2019 YoY growth of 26%, Q1 growth deceleration amounts to -16%.The Cash App ecosystem will partly offset the Seller segment losses. Cash App ecosystem gross profit grew 118% year over year in January and February, and in March, the COVID-19 impact on gross profit has been less pronounced than for the Seller ecosystem.I believe that the COVID-19 disruption will significantly benefit the Cash App ecosystem. Adoption will significantly increase, as the necessity of moving money between family members could open the door to less penetrated customer segments such as parents (an older, generally wealthier segment). Confirmation of higher interest in the app can be found in the trend below:Figure 3 – Source: Google trends (cash app)Moreover, the stock market has gained lots of attention due to its recent wild movements. With people stuck at home, there has been a growing interest in stock trading and investing (Figure 4). Riding the trend, Cash App should see an influx of new small market participants that could be attracted by the simplicity of the app and to the small capital required due to Cash App fractional investing.Figure 4 – Source: Google trends (stock trading)Cash App is strengthening, and it has certainly increased its reach during this pandemic. The app is building a strong foundation that will likely lead to accelerated growth in the second half of the year and beyond.Historically, Square transaction-based revenue has been the weakest in the first quarter. Although weakness will continue for at least the beginning of Q2, the ecosystem should have majorly recovered by Q4, where GPV is at the highest point due to holiday sales. The COVID-19 disruption is, therefore, happening in a “lucky” quarter, where business damage is the lowest.Square eCommerce segment should also benefit as more and more business moves online. Moreover, in these challenging times, Square Capital should also see an increase in loan volumes as small businesses stumble back to their feet.The recent 60% decline in stock price was certainly an overreaction, especially for investors focused on the long term. My estimates show that growth will decelerate by around 20%, and I believe that the decline of almost 30% from $85 to $60 has sufficiently priced in the slowdown. However, while the main business is slowing, the slowdown should be limited to the short term, while the positive trends of Cash App and eCommerce will last well beyond the pandemic.Source: FinvizSquare is not a one-trick pony. COVID-19 will impact the company in the short term, but Cash App increased adoption and returning transaction volumes will bring the company back to previous levels. At 30% discount over pre-COVID prices, I believe it is worth initiating a small position as the company maintains significant long-term potential."
4334952,98236,2020-03-30T10:52:46-04:00,Square held a virtual analyst meeting on March 24.The company discussed some favorable operating trends that it had experienced in the first two months of the year.It presented revised guidance for the first quarter given the impact of the virus on the overall economy.The company had enjoyed a very substantial upside to expectations through the first two months of the quarter.The company had seen a fall-off of something like 35% year over year in the transaction of GMV in the last few days before March 24.,"This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Another day, another set of analyst projections that are centered around the impact that the Covid-19 virus will have on the economy and some profound angst as unemployment claims go through the roof. The market continues to take investors through roller-coaster ups and downs with not all that much in the way of logic. No matter.This is going to be an article about the investment merits of Square (SQ)-particularly based on some of the information the company released during its virtual analyst day that was held on 3/24. Although Square's presentation wasn't as far reaching in some ways as I might have hoped, mainly because of just how fluid the situation is, it should change the calculus of some as to what the real opportunities are for this company - albeit, after the worst impacts of the lock-downs and shut-downs recede. The company will obviously take a major hit in the revenue from its Sellers segment - after all, many of those sellers are closed and others are doing business on a limited basis.As of Thursday's close, Square shares are up by about 40% this week. That is somewhat crazy, but an artifact of these very volatile times through which we are passing. Square has had a relatively significant short interest with about 8% of the float short as of the middle of March. I have to assume that some of this spike is based on short covering, as negative sentiment might have diminished given the strength the company reported in its operations prior to the onset of the panic, the closures and so forth. And, for what it is worth, the shares are still down by 33% so far in March.Square's trading pattern has been more than a bit volatile in the years since I first became a holder and a follower. In the last year, the shares have been as low as $32 and as high as $87. Underlying all of that range has been concern relating to 2 discrete factors.One of these has been a steady decline in the percentage growth of the company's transaction volume. Square started its life as a payment processing company and it still derives lots of revenues and margins from that segment of its business. Last quarter, the Sellers segment represented 59% of total gross profit and was up 27% year over year. It has been a bit disconcerting for some investors -- and perhaps this writer -- to see the growth slippage in that component -- particularly given the many opportunities in that eco-system.What I found particularly interesting as part of the presentation was that gross profit growth from the seller's segment had accelerated to 32% growth in the first two months of this quarter. Obviously, financial statements are not built on two months of data. And no one will ever know how the quarter might have turned out had there been no economic turmoil and social distancing and lockdowns. But that number, at least to me, was particularly encouraging suggesting that there were some green shoots to be seen from its investment in accelerating the growth of its sellers eco-system.On the other hand, and somewhat exactly opposite, is the concern that the growth of Square Cash is just too good to last. After all, how can there be a competitive advantage to providing cash for customers and taking a fee for doing so. Initially, I was a bit skeptical of how that would work out - but seeing has to be believing. And people are still signing up for the app and doing so at a record pace.The cash app has shown exceptional growth over the past couple of years. Last quarter its revenues grew 96% and the total revenues for this segment which includes software and services grew by 78%. Apparently, based on the guidance that was provided for Q1, in the midst of a sharp end of quarter drop in payments revenues, the revenues from the Cash App and other business components must be showing remarkable growth. Overall, despite the fall-off in payment processing revenues (25% or more with downward trends as of 3/24), the company has forecast that gross profits for the entire company will fall by only 6% from its prior forecast-for this company, due to the way it reports, gross profits are essentially a proxy for revenue. The company has also suspended current charges for software to its clients to help them over this rough patch. So, the revenue growth from the cash app must be continuing at rates near the triple digit mark to achieve the kind of overall result that was forecast by Square on its investor update conference call. It seems apparent that the impact of the virus has led to some stronger demand for fintech apps pretty much across the board as part of a ""social distancing"" paradigm by customers. Apparently, the monetization of these apps has actually accelerated, as consumers need to send money and then use ancillary services.The investment case for Square shares is basically that the company has 2 flourishing eco-systems with strong technology and apparently high levels of user satisfaction. Because of the effort the company has made to create a flywheel, it has been able to create a fair level of differentiation between its overall offerings and those of the competition. The company's investment in sales and marketing, in particular, had started to reawaken the potential of its Seller's eco-system before the onset of fraught economics brought on particularly by Covid-19 and its concomitant lock-down and closures. The Square Cash app, and its own set of additional applications and services, has actually shown resilience thus far in this economic downturn. The company said that new users for the cash app had reached an all-time peak last week.Obviously, the valuation formulas that I use are distorted in this period of time as no one seriously expects companies to grow or to generate high levels of free cash flow. That said, I have, and will continue to use a 3-year growth rate forecast for Square in the range of mid-high 30%. That is lower than the company's growth prior to the impact of the economy on its operations (45%), and likely below any kind of reasonable set of expectations given the early success of some of its initiatives to revive the growth of its sellers business segment. After making an adjustment to my current year estimates to account for the impact of the economy on expectations, Square's EV/S has fallen to around 7.9X. This is noticeably below the ratio for other companies in its growth cohort. I expect its free cash flow margin to be about 12-14% this year. That will be significantly greater than average for the company's growth cohort. I consider the opportunity to acquire these shares at those prices to a better value than most other investment alternatives in the high growth space at this time.It is, and has been, my contention that readers will do themselves a great favor by trying to look through current conditions. The optimal investments now, in my opinion, aren't the largest, or the ""safest"" or the vendors whose business has seen less of an impact from the macro-economy. Why might I say that? It certainly isn't the conventional wisdom or the direction of many recommendations on SA and elsewhere. Essentially, it has proven to be popular amongst the financial analyst community to over-emphasize the negatives, both overall, and for specific companies. There has been a certain degree of neglect to try to determine which companies have seen the greatest share price impact and which companies have the best prospects of strong business trends when looking at ""the other side.""I can't quite represent all of the reasons for Square's share price performance this week other than to say it is possibly an example of my contention (joking) or a snap back from an oversold condition. What is happening now, and will be happening in the next couple of months in terms of Square's operational performance is not representative, either for Square, or for any other company. The fact that the company's GMV is plummeting as venues close and customers themselves are locked down or have lost their jobs is not specifically surprising or even worrisome in terms of evaluating Square's longer-term outlook. What might be surprising, at least to some, is that the company remains comfortably profitable even in these ""worst of times"" and that its performance during a normal economy was significantly above consensus forecasts.I have been a long-term holder of Square shares - indeed, I first bought them as long ago as 2017 back when they were far lower. I have traded around a core position for some time now and recently added to my position just before the company announced its latest results. I currently hold about a 5%+ position in my Ticker Target high-growth portfolio in Square shares, and I think that for anyone looking for a prime ""recovery"" name, this should be something to consider at this price and at this time.Square, as has been mentioned above, is basically composed of two distinct businesses that intersect at some points, but which really operate quite autonomously. Reviewing what each of these eco-systems can offer their users might help solidify in the minds of some investors the company's opportunities. The potential market for Square's seller offerings is one of the largest to be seen in the software world. It is made up of 4 basic components. These include payment processing, software, capital, and financial services. Currently, Square is focused on just the US market although it does have some efforts underway in the UK, Canada, and Australia. The Seller also includes a POS offering, and chip reader as well as 3rd party peripherals which are essentially loss leaders and likely to remain so.The company has developed and started to sell specific bundles of services for retail, restaurants, appointments (these are typically small services businesses such as beauty and barber shops and nail salons) and the Square on-line store. It also has some basic functionality to manage teams, CRM and loyalty. It offers a platform approach to 3rd party products. Square also offers functionality that is called instant transfer and core flex loans as part of its capital offering. Most of these ancillary services and software have very high gross margins. In fact, the company's instant transfer offering, which charges users 1% to get access to their transactions one day early is probably one of the biggest legal money-makers of which I am aware. The key to Square's growth is going to be a pivot from what it calls its side-car payment payments segment, to the other services the company offers. That has been happening on a consistent basis, but the company still has a very long potential runway in cross selling its small business users on its software, in particular.Over the past few years, the company has expanded its base of sellers by 70% and has increased its average gross profit per seller by more than 130%. In the last several conference calls, the company has been focused on explaining the economics of additional spend on sales and marketing for sellers. It has been able to achieve a 4 quarter payback on that type of spending which has then grown by a factor of more than 5X over 5 years.The continuation of these kinds of economics is one of the bigger bets investors face at Square at the moment. Will it be able to maintain those kinds of economics as it continues to focus on larger sellers, and ramps its spending to both capture additional sellers and to get its current base of sellers to use the balance of its offering. One doesn't have to go all in on that bet these days given the relatively modest EV/S ratio. And the numbers presented for the first two months of the quarter which showed gross profit from the sellers segment rising at 32% provides a certain level of substantiation. The overall economics for Square can get pretty impressive in a short period of time if the prior statistics regarding paybacks and cohort expansion continue into the future.That said, it is important for investors to realize that none of that is going to happen until the worst ravages of the viruses recede and businesses return to a less dire status. Right now, the company is in the midst of deleting most discretionary marketing spend relating to the Sellers segment whose value would be lost at this point. The reduction in planned spend is one reason why overall business metrics for Square in terms of actual earnings may not be quite as dire in Q1 and beyond as might otherwise be the case.But even smaller sellers need the kinds of digital transformation that they can obtain from Square and are hard pressed to find elsewhere. Most of Square's sellers simply do not have the relative equivalent of IT functionality when compared to larger sellers when it comes to managing campaigns or in terms of inventory management and basic operational automation. It is a large opportunity that is very difficult to access…unless access is already part of the payment paradigm. The company, in its investor presentation, has presented its forecast that shows that this opportunity is, overall, of the same relative size as that of payment processing. If it works, that is a major opportunity that is not really considered in evaluating the shares.Another important part of the Square Seller's Flywheel is Square Capital, the company's small business lending program. Capital has seen a consistent growth of almost 50%/year in loan originations which reached $2.3 billion last year. The business has been highly profitable simply because of the frictionless effort to originate loans and the steady decline in the core loan loss rate to well below 4%, coupled with very high interest rates that are charged. As the company pointed out in its presentation, the company has proprietary data about its loan clients based on real-time payments and behavioral data. Further, the company is in first position in payment hierarchy, and its average loan length is less than 9 months. Most of the loans are funded by long-term investors, allowing Square to leverage its capital and act as an agent with a very large commission. It simply is very hard for other lenders to match Square's opportunities to lend money at high margins and lower risk to its small business clients and there is no foreseeable way to anticipate any changes in that environment.I want to reiterate that most of the capital and the risk of Square Capital's loans are borne by 3rd party investors, with Square, itself, acting as an agent. It packages loans and sells them to a variety of large institutional investors. There have been some who have been concerned about defaults. At least through the time of the analyst day, defaults were at normal levels of less than 4% despite the kinds of customers who have taken loans. Square has used a rather sophisticated implementation of AI to determine creditworthiness. And it is in 1st position on the loans outstanding and can and does seek repayment by essentially appropriating sales-it does not loan to anyone who does not use Square as its payment processor. I expect concerns about credit losses are part of the reason for the company's share price decline - I think those concerns are overdone based on what was presented.What will happen, I expect is that loan originations will decline sharply this quarter and next quarter before resuming their upward trend. There is a great hunger for frictionless loans amongst small businesses and Square has one of the best solutions out there. That won't be changing when the recovery arrives.I am not going to try to recapitulate all of the different ways in which Square is able to grow its cash advance business. The latest numbers which show such dramatic increases in first time users speak for themselves. The company has created some kind of cachet to using its service to send cash. Just why its customers feel sending cash by Square is better in some way is not something about which this writer is able to comment - other than to say that the competition from Venmo and Zelle has clearly not made any headway against Square Cash. I have included this review of the app for readers potentially interested in this kind of discussion - but regardless of anything else, Square Cash just seemingly has a brand identity that is hard to account for but which has led to much more monetization than I or most anyone else had ever anticipated. (Square Cash App Review: What Is It and How Does It Stack up Against Its Competitors? | MagnifyMoney)After all of this time, I still have to marvel just how many businesses are willing to pay 1% to gain access to their funds a day early-but apparently that demand is close to insatiable. In addition to the Peer to Peer systems that Square offers, it allows its users to spend money. It offers a cash card, it has something it calls Boost which allows users to receive discounts if they use the Square Cash Card at participating establishments such as coffee shops, restaurants and other retail establishments. Cash SupportSquare was recently granted authority to organize an industrial bank which essentially cleans up the multiple regulatory authorities who have charters that involve some level of supervision of Square Cash services. Square Receives FDIC Approval, Aims to Open a Bank By 2021.One of the ways in which Square has been able to utilize its payment processing system to grow its cash app is what is called stored balance. Square offers a business debit card linked to the payments received by Sellers. This is the venue to transfer funds to a bank for either for free or a fee. This link details some of the ways in which Sellers typically use their stored balances. Square Card: Business Debit Card for Real-Time Access to Balance What might be noticed here is that the entire process is part of a potentially unified eco-systems that sellers can use to manage their financial affairs. It obviously starts with payment processing but potentially includes all of the other enumerated financial services and even accounting, campaign management and analytics.The record of Square's Cash Unit performance has been far stronger than most observers had thought was possible. By Q4-2019, the rate of daily transacting active users had risen by 80% compared to the prior year and this pace has apparently been maintained in early 2020, even after the impact of the virus on the economy. The revenue statistics have been equally strong with users opting for more paid services, raising the annualized revenue average to $30/year, double what it had been when the Cash Unit started operations.The economics that Square has tracked with regards to the Cash Unit show very high ROI for marketing spend, with a payback on sales and marketing spend in less than 1 year. The ultimate ROI is about 5.5X the initial spend.There continues to be some level of skepticism that Cash Unit has created a differentiated set of services and will be able to grow at hyper rates on into the future. The company guidance - when it was last provided - called for the growth of the Cash Unit to show dramatic slowing this year. That is why revenue growth expectations were forecasted at 34% compared to an adjusted 45% in 2019. At the moment, that slowdown is not happening; indeed, it appears from what was said, overall, that revenue growth at the Cash Unit has remained at hyper levels.Given the current valuation of Square shares, one does not need to forecast that Cash Unit revenues have to grow at 80%-90% to support a purchase recommendation. As a long-term growth estimate, I have used a 37% growth for the entire company, which implies Cash Unit growth in the mid-40% range and Seller growth of 32%. It seems reasonable to suggest that there is some considerable upside in terms of what might be reasonably expected given there is no current sign to suggest that the growth in Cash Unit has fallen to anywhere close to the mid-40% range.Square doesn't have the typical business model of an IT vendor. Until the last quarter, it would remove the pass through revenues from payment processing from its pro-forma presentation. For reasons not readily determinable, the SEC frowned on that practice and now the headline numbers are based on the full amount of revenue that the company collects. Almost no one uses that kind of presentation - and neither do I. Most analysts simply remove the transaction based costs to calculate revenues that are comparable to those of other companies. Last quarter for example, transaction based revenues were $832 million and transaction based costs were $519 million. So, basically, the revenues from payment processing, rather than from the fees that are passed through were $313 million, and that brought total revenue for the quarter to an adjusted level of $793 million.During calls, and as detailed above, the company uses a different and higher figure for the contribution of its seller segment, as seller revenue includes revenues that are otherwise recorded on the income statement in subscription and in hardware. The company reports a loss in its hardware segment. Some of its hardware revenues are pass-through of third party products and the company is willing to sustain losses in order to generate highly profitable services revenues.Overall, its gross margins on GMV have been around 1.08% for the past two years. The company recently made a modest tweak to its pricing for Sellers to raise prices for the smallest of transaction balanced by a small reduction in costs for larger transactions. As the company continues its efforts to recruit larger sellers to its platform, there might be some tendency for gross margins on GMV itself to fall, but this will be offset by the likely higher revenues from higher margin ancillary services.Square has been able to achieve far more substantial profitability and cashflow than most hyper-growth IT vendors. In particular, its GAAP gross margins on subscription and services revenue was 82% last quarter, up from 73% in the year earlier quarter. The gross margins on the cash segment can be extremely high, and of course software gross margins are also capable of reaching 90%. Last quarter, transaction and loan losses rose by about 33% year on year, or far less than the 96% increase in Cash segment revenues.Based on adjusted net revenues of $793 million last quarter, this company spends a relatively modest amount on both sales and marketing and research and development. Last quarter, as it was for many vendors was an exceptional quarter, and regardless of anything else, the metrics on opex last quarter were below planned levels. Last quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, the company spent only 13% of revenues on research and development, and 22% of revenues on sales and marketing. Given the economics that the company presented, the company's strategy of increasing these ratios to accelerate growth would appear to be well founded. General and administrative cost at 12% of adjusted revenues is probably in-line for companies of this size and growth rate.Last year, the company achieved operating cash flows of 17% of adjusted revenue and its free cash flow margin was 14.5%. Cash flow margins can vary depending on the timing of customer payable balances and settlement payable balances. The transaction in which the company's Caviar food delivery service was sold to DoorDash resulted in a book loss of $373 million, although of course a substantial cash inflow. Overall, last year, adjusted EBITDA came to about 15% of adjusted revenues. Prior to the upset of the economy, the company had project that adjusted EBITDA would grow about 25% this year, or less than revenue. The difference would have been increased sales and marketing expense to accelerate Sellers segment revenue growth. Given the evidence presented about past returns from greater investments in sales and marketing, it might have been anticipated that revenue growth would accelerate above 35% in future periods.Earlier in March, Square was able to negotiate the sale of $1 billion of convertible debt on terms most of us could only hope for. The coupon rate is 0.125% and the debt is convertible at around $131/share. Of course, the shares were much higher when the conversion price was set-but it does suggest the pre-crisis appetite amongst institutions for derivative instruments for Square shares.Of course, now we will never know how Square's business might have really progressed. But I believe that the potential for the strategy has been under-appreciated by investors-and the details about operations during the first two months of the current year as well as the commentary about the continuing strong growth of the Cash segment have strengthened and confirmed my belief in the future of this company in the recovery I hope will soon be at hand.There is a wide array of investment objectives at this time - and frankly a dearth of really representative operational news to support different sets of expectations. In the case of Square, I believe some of the commentary during the recent analyst call/virtual meeting was highly constructive with regards to the company's strategy to enhance growth by growing spending on sales and marketing. To be sure, that strategy is obviously on hold now until the economic impact of the virus wanes. I really don't know if that will happen in 60 days or 90 days or 120 days. This company will see noticeable declines in the revenue from its sellers sector as the fees for processing GMV fall sharply, offset, in whole or part by increases in revenue from its highly profitable cash business segment. But I am just not sure how much these kinds of interim performance metrics matter, or should matter to investors.My contention is that in normal times, this company should continue to achieve hyper-growth along with high levels of profitability and cash generation. That kind of an outcome is not reflected in the currently compressed share price. I think the shares will show a strong recovery once it becomes plain that the world is not coming to an end and is starting to recover."
4333352,104941,2020-03-20T18:13:44-04:00,"Prior to the market meltdown, I was pounding the table on Square in the low $60s. It soared to the $80s, outstripping the market by a wide margin.Now, the market has absolutely collapsed, and Square's discount has created an extremely attractive entry point.I demonstrate quantitatively why Square is a great buy today.I understand Square is now in the $40s. The balance sheet is incredibly strong. It's a great company. It will rebound. My thesis still stands in the $40s.","Source: Square.comAbout two months ago, I introduced a two-part series, in which I examined the businesses of Square (NYSE:SQ) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). In the original piece, I recommended investors purchase Square in the low $60s. Since then, Square rocketed into the low $80s, despite a 15% decline in the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY). Of course, the recent virus fear has decimated those gains, along with the rest of the market. This has created a fantastic entry point of investors who have been hoping to get long Square. I am here today to reiterate that bullish narrative and to justify it mathematically.Firstly, I will start by juxtaposing Shopify's valuation with Square's valuation so as to illustrate the irrationality of the market at present. Then, I will discuss why Square remains indispensable to a wide swath of businesses in the world. And lastly, I will demonstrate mathematically why buying Square at today's price remains a great buy for long-term investors.I will construct this section's argument in a series of charts. Hopefully, by the end of this ""slideshow"", you will see my point.To start, I will share a chart depicting Square's price to sales versus Shopify's price to sales.Source: YChartsNow, let's look at which company generates more in the way of sales.Source: YChartsAnd interestingly, Shopify was founded in 2004; whereas, Square was founded in 2009. So, Square has accomplished these revenues at a substantially faster rate than Shopify.Now, let's check out the rate at which these companies grew last quarter.Source: YChartsNext, let's look at gross margins.Source: YChartsAnd lastly, let's look at free cash flow.Source: YChartsSo, as you can see, Square has grown faster, now grows just as fast, and generates exponentially more free cash flow than Shopify. Nevertheless, the market places a 27x price to sales on Shopify and a 5.5x price to sales on Square. Something has to give here: either Shopify will meaningfully re-rate lower, or, as I expect, Square will meaningfully re-rate higher.To be fair, Shopify's gross margins are about 25% higher than those of Square, but for Shopify's price to sales to be almost 300% higher than Square's price to sales, there would need to be a much larger difference in gross margins.But it's all about growth, right? And as I expect to hear: ""Shopify's target market is not only growing faster, but it's also substantially larger!""I strongly agree with that standpoint, and hence, Shopify will likely not re-rate substantially lower. Instead, Square will continue to re-rate substantially higher.But before we get into Square's valuation mathematically speaking, let's check out why Square's business is not going to be decimated by Shopify or other competitors as many speculate.Shopify has received its rating because e-commerce is supposed to grow massively over the coming decades, and while that's true, it ignores that there are tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands or millions of brick and mortar businesses that need highly functional POS's for their specific realities.Examples include:And the list goes on and on, and within those lists are hundreds of thousands of businesses. Additionally, Square has barely begun its expansion into international markets.I write this to highlight the fact that Square has a massive runway for growth ahead of it, and it has not been firmly concluded that Shopify will control 100% of the e-commerce space. Square will also take a bite of it, though it must innovate quickly so as to maintain its position as a competitor with Shopify.As can be seen below, estimates remain very rosy for Square's growth, and these estimates will inform our valuation later in this article.Source: YChartsAs can be seen above, Square's revenues are projected to grow steadily. Also, of note, they have done away with adjusted EBITDA as directed by the SEC. I'm not sure who in the organization thought that creating their own metrics would be a good idea, as they also don't report cash from operations, which is incredibly annoying (instead choosing to report adjusted EBITDA). However, Square should leave those innovative streaks to their core business and just report its financials as 99% of all other companies report their financials.In order to determine this, I will value Square from two perspectives:This is a slightly modified version of my typical L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, and you can witness the full version of it here. So, let's get started!In light of the coronavirus impact, we must reduce our expectations for this year, which, I must note, ultimately, will only serve to create higher growth rates in the future. But for the sake of those that will surely exclaim the extent to which Square's sales will decline as a result of the virus, I will account for the very near-term decline.I project a conservative decline in sales for Q1 and Q2 would be 30%.Source: YChartsSo, let's reduce its current free cash flow per share potential of $1.20 by 30%. This results in a starting free cash flow per share of $.84. Let's model this below:Discounted Cash Flow ModelSource: Data compiled from YChartsTherefore, at a price of $55, Square is technically undervalued by 6%. Of course, this assumes that Square's sales will actually decline by 30% over the next 2-3 months. This may or may not transpire, and nobody in good faith can determine whether it will actually happen.Additionally, an average free cash flow per share growth of 25% actually becomes conservative in light of the fact that Square just grew by 40+%, and its growth rate from a 30% depressed starting point will ensure that, on average, Square will achieve a 25% annualized growth rate in free cash flow over the coming decade. That is, it only takes 3 or 4 years of 30-40% growth and 6 or 7 years of 20% and below growth to average 25% over ten years. For example, 3 years of 40% growth from this point, then 7 years of 15% growth equates to an average annualized growth rate of 22.5%.What's more, Square's domestic and international expansion opportunities create a growth runway that could easily accommodate the above growth rate scenario.Now, let's move on to step 2.Next, we will arrive at a 2030 price target, by which we will determine our expected annualized return.Source: Data compiled from YChartsTherefore, one can expect an annualized rate of return of 15.62% if one were to purchase Square at $55. Such a return will almost certainly decimate market returns over the coming decade.The greatest risk factors Square faces are the following:In reference to number 1, Square seems to have the ""Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Formula"" down pat. In that, its sleek, simple-to-use design has delighted its merchants for the last 5 to 10 years. However, this competitive moat could erode if its innovative streak wanes in light of its enormous success.With respect to number 2, I actually believe Jack is truly a genius and will go down as one of America's best CEOs of all time. With that being said, I get the sense that he's a wild card, and I know I am not alone in feeling that way about it. To be sure, this is inexcusable. As the CEO of a company, one should be aggressive, innovative, and a thought leader, but not at the expense of investors' sense of trust in you.And lastly, the third threat is very real, as such technology could come to dominate the POS landscape. Square could certainly create a competing product; although, at present, Amazon seems to be the leader within the space, which is something that must be monitored. In all scenarios such as this, I respond by ""hedging all of my positions"" by simply continuing to own Amazon.Square and Shopify, for that matter, have become fantastic buys in light of the coronavirus's impact on the U.S. economy. Of course, the market may fall another 10%. It may fall another 25%. I don't really know, nor do I really care. I can say, however, with a high degree of certainty, that buying Square at $55 will yield fantastic returns over the coming decade. Once again, I don't know what the market will do, nor does anyone with 100% certainty, and Square could fall another 15% or even 30%. I'm not ruling that out.But I bought more at $54. I don't plan to add anymore, simply because the position is already about 4% of my L.A. Stevens Investment Fund portfolio.As always, thanks for reading; please remember to follow for more, and happy investing!"
4333155,22148,2020-03-19T19:49:40-04:00,"Square gets 45% of GPVs from sellers generating under $125,000 in sales.The payments company is likely to see customers go out of business.My base case is 0% revenue growth in 2020 and a return to only 15% growth in 2021.The stock is a buy at 7x '21 adjusted revenues with potential upside to estimates.","The Covid-19 outbreak and the shutdown of the global economy has investors fleeing Square (NYSE:SQ). The mobile payment company is highly dependent on small business customers, and the economic slowdown is going to hit their customer base the hardest. Just weeks ago, my view on the stock was negative with the price back above $80, and now, the stock is far more appealing after a 50% collapse in a matter of weeks.Image Source: Square websiteSquare built their business of supplying a mobile payments solution to small businesses when other POS systems weren't flexible enough for a business outside of a traditional retail store. For this reason, a substantial amount of their revenue is derived by customers requiring physical engagement likely hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak.The company is constantly shifting business mix towards larger sellers, but Square still has 45% of their payments business from sellers generating under $125,000 in annualized gross payment volumes or GPV. These are businesses that by default can only employ a few people and are unlikely to be well capitalized.Source: Square Q4'19 shareholder letterThe stock is down for this reason due to a large portion of their business with retailers destroyed over the next month or so. Even businesses in the $500,000 annualized GPV range with 5-10 employees are likely to struggle.Square could easily see 30% of this business disappear in the next month with up to 10% never to return. The GPV last Q1 was $22.6 billion, and the payments company was on a path to 25% growth.Normalized GPV in the quarter would've been around $28.3 billion without the coronavirus disruption. One can't really predict the quarterly impact, but one has to guess the size of the customer base for Square once this virus shutdown ends.The company could easily lose up to 10% of volumes through next year. Even with market share gains, Square could see growth rates dip from a 30% range to 20% or below. On an adjusted revenue basis, revenues were only scheduled to grow 24% to $2.8 billion, so the revenue growth rate would dip to below 15% with a loss of 10% of volumes.The big question is whether Cash App revenues are disrupted. The App alone delivered $183 million in Q4 revenues, while Bitcoin revenues were $178 million. Square should see a substantial dip in Bitcoin trading revenues with the price down substantially, though these revenues don't count in the traditional adjusted revenue used to value the stock. Those revenues will shrink either during Q1 and definitely by Q2, but the only amount that matters is whether the $183 million from the Cash App revenues hold up here with the younger crowd lacking jobs and cash.Source: Square Q4'19 shareholder letterThe stock has traded down from above $80 to below $40 in weeks. With a diluted share count of 486 million, Square is still worth $19.4 billion with the stock at $40.If the company still forecasted adjusted revenues of $2.8 billion, the stock would be an extreme buy with revenues forecasted to grow at a 24% range. The question is what the market pays for the stock with a 10 percentage point hit to the revenue growth rate in the future.At only 15% adjusted revenue growth for 2021 after the best outcome of probably flat adjusted revenues in 2020, Square would generate revenues of $2.6 billion next year. Now, these are more normalized numbers as the company could see a 30% to 50% hit to revenues in the next few months.Square has a cash balance of $2.1 billion, so the company has no real liquidity concerns. The stock currently has an enterprise value of $18.2 billion.Based on updated expectations of Square not generating any adjusted revenue growth in 2020 and returning to only 15% growth in 2021, the stock trades at about 7.0x 2021 revenue estimates.Source: Stone Fox Capital calculationsThe key investor takeaway is that even with the impact to revenues, Square hasn't traded this cheap in years. Over the long run, the payments company is innovative enough to come out of this difficult time stronger and could return to faster growth than forecasted. Users could actually utilize the Cash App more aggressively in a virtual world, making Square a buy at $40. Anybody buying the stock has to brace for some volatile numbers in the next few quarters."
4334095,100666,2020-03-25T09:42:12-04:00,"Not surprisingly, Square cut its Q1 2020 guidance, but much less than most had anticipated.The gross margins of Cash App have kept the company close to its goal.The TAM of Square is $160B.Square Capital is much stronger than a lot of investors think.The stock is definitely much cheaper now.","On the day that I write this, March 24, Square (SQ) held its investor day. The company shared an update on Q1 2020 guidance and that information showed again that Cash App is the part of Square that will be the driver for growth for years to come.As everyone expected, Square revised its guidance for Q1. But the cut was a lot less than most pundits expected. Net revenue expectations were lowered from $1.34B-$1.36B to $1.30B-$1.34B or just 2.2% at the midpoint. EPS will be under the guidance just issued three weeks ago.The main reason for the cut is, of course, a slowdown in gross processing volume for its Seller ecosystem. But the impact on the Cash App ecosystem gross profit was lower than for the Seller ecosystem. Here is what the statement of the company said on the Covid-19 impact:Also as expected, Square withdrew its guidance for 2021.In January and February, the Seller ecosystem gross profit grew by 32% YoY, which is a great achievement but that's nothing versus the Cash App gross profit growth of a whopping 118% YoY.(All images come from the Investor Day presentation, unless otherwise stated)Combined, the company saw gross profits grow at 51% before the coronavirus came throwing a spanner in the works. These numbers really look very good and I even expect them to continue to thrive after Covid-19 has left the country.Because of the growing gross margins, the company has become profitable. While net income was positive for the first time in 2019, the adjusted EBITDA has tripled in the last two years, from $139M to $417M.Square now sees its TAM (total addressable market) at $160B, a combination of the seller ecosystem and Cash App:This is how the Sellers ecosystem's TAM is composed:The rest ($15B) comes from international current markets, future international expansion and the introduction of new products and applications.Don't forget that Square is also the second biggest payroll processing software for SMBs (small and middle-sized businesses) and that is also included in the Seller ecosystem:(Source)I have already mentioned that connecting Square's two ecosystems would be the holy grail for the company. But maybe that's too theoretical and an example will show you what I mean. Square's payroll service could funnel employees to Cash App's stock trading capability to manage their 401(k). I have repeated in numerous articles and comments that I like companies with these kinds of options.Square also wants to grow the Seller ecosystem by focusing more on the so-called mid-market. That consists of companies with a yearly revenue between $1M and $100M, which is a step up from SMBs:Don't forget that Square started in the micro market and was already able to scale up to SMBs. If Square can tap the middle market better, its share of the TAM would definitely go up. It stands at less than 3% right now for the Seller ecosystem. Square wants to continue to focus on bigger customers, but that trend has already started. Sellers with more than $500,000 in GPV (gross payment volume) have grown to half of the total GPV. For Cash App, Square sees a TAM of about $60B.Important here is to note that this is, as opposed to the Seller system, for the USA alone. And that huge number is also without the huge opportunities in new markets, which Square sees as something for the long term:At this moment, the company has only been able to capture less than 2% of the TAM.Especially in these dire times, a lot of investors are afraid of Square Capital. It is seen as a weak link for Square. While the total capital in loans to SMBs has risen a lot, to $2.3B in 2019, the loss-rate on these loans has come down:The reason is that Square only selects candidates that use its POS (point-of-sale) system. And that gives Square Capital insight in which businesses are eligible for loans. After all, the company has all of your sales and transactions. Depending on this information, a decision is made if you can have a loan, how big and under which terms.Square works with Celtic Bank and the money is funded by a wide range of large asset managers, 40 Act funds, bank subsidiaries, pension plans, and insurance vehicles.That also means that even if the Loan Loss Rate would go up, which is likely in this environment, Square itself doesn't hold the bag. Besides that, Square Capital works on another basis than most loans. As a business owner, you pay back the loan under the form of a percentage of your transactions. That means that this will be a relief for SMBs who had to close because of Covid-19. No transactions, no principal and interest payment. These loans are also smaller sums with a short repayment term of 18 months. The average loan is paid back in 8 to 9 months.Cash App keeps chalking impressive growth in the number of monthly transacting actives:Impressive is that daily transacting actives even grew stronger than the monthly transacting actives, at the speed of 80% YoY. This shows that for a lot of people Cash App is their primary source of financial actions. I think that the trading possibility, which was introduced in September of 2019, will also have advanced the daily transacting actives.It's not just the number of transacting actives that keeps growing for Cash App. Square is also able to gain more and more revenue from these users, despite the high growth. You would expect that new users have a dampening effect on the average revenue per user, but the complete opposite is true:And I expect this number to go beyond the current $30. After all, only about half of Square's users are monetized, but the number keeps going up steadily:As I wrote in my last article, I have already added to my Square position, first at $45 and then (see the comment section) at $33. The stock went up by 15.75% today to $46.31 (Tuesday, 25th) and another 1.92% post-market after this news was announced. I think investors were relieved that the guidance cut for Q1 was so small. That's the advantage of Square always being conservative in its estimates. But I don't know what the stock price will be when this comes out. Maybe Square is down 20% again, who can tell in this market?So I'm not suggesting that Square stock price is out of the woods now. There's still a lot of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) around the stock. We simply cannot know what the stock price will do, although there are certainly enough people who act as if they can.At this moment, we still don't know what will happen and what the impact will be on the whole economy. Of course, Covid-19 will have a serious impact on Square, but that goes for about any company. Square has cut its Q1 guidance now, but very mildly. I expect a slew of companies that follow this example.The strange thing is that people are now much more bearish than when the stock traded at $85. Yes, the stock might go down again. But I'm pretty confident that if you look back even at this price in a decade, you'll have a really good feeling about it. I often get the impression that there are more long-term investors in word than in deeds.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from a long-term perspective, feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4329201,69905,2020-03-03T13:23:47-05:00,Square's top line is guided towards deceleration.Square's Cash App continues to deliver positive surprises to shareholders.This stock is simply too expensive at 87x forward adjusted earnings.,"Square (SQ) reported highly mixed Q4 2019 results.On the one hand, the company's consolidated revenue growth rate is slowing down, rapidly. On the other hand, its Cash App segment reported astonishing growth rates. In fact, this latter segment, which makes up 27% of total company's gross profit, looks very attractive.However, Square's stock is fully priced already and leaves no margin of safety, and investors are primed for disappointment. Here's why:(source)Source: author's calculations, press statementsNote, for full-year 2019, I have used Square's adjusted net revenue growth rates excluding Caviar (45%). Including the recently sold business unit, Square's net revenues would be up 43% year-over-year - hence, year-over-year growth rate is largely unchanged with and without Caviar.However, what's important, is that in Q4 2019 there was a more pronounced difference, with growth rates of 46% excluding Caviar versus 41% including this sold unit. My point?If Square's Q4 2019 core operations were up 46% year-over-year (excluding Caviar), then why is there such a strong deceleration going into 2020?Consider this, given that Q1 2020 is guided for a 44% growth rate (excluding Cavier), to finish the year at just a 33% revenue growth rate must imply that its Seller ecosystem must be decelerating at a rapid clip.Indeed, Square CFO Amrita Ahuja noted on the call that Square's Seller ecosystem should be growing its gross profit lines stably at 26%. Even though this points towards the gross profit line, we are able to infer enough to understand that Square's revenue growth rate must be pointing towards mid-25%-28% revenue growth rates. Now onto some unexpected good news:(source)I would be lying if my heart did not race when I read over Q4 2019 results. Cash App not only looks like it's growing fast but probably equally attractive, it's picking up its pace of growth.Square's Cash App was up 147% year-over-year (no typos) having reported revenue growth rates of 115% in Q3 2019. What's more, Cash App not only is growing at a breakneck pace, but it now makes up roughly 27% of Square's consolidated gross profits, and with a run rate basis (excluding Bitcoin) of over $700 million in revenues - not a small unit in any way.Although no updates were given on Square's Cash App retention rates in Q4 2019, they were noted as being similar to its reported retention rates highlighted in Q3 2019, which were above 100%.Indeed, we know from CEO Jack Dorsey's comments that Cash App continues to benefit from very strong network effects, that once a family member or employee comes onto the platform, they invite others and so on. Then, once on the platform, users discover other popular features, including Bitcoin, the Cash Card, Boost, and fractional equity investing.The problem for investors is to find any sort of valuation edge that is not already being priced in at $35 billion, once we factor in its declining growth rates and combine it with no clear path towards strong consistent GAAP profitability.Note: Square sold Caviar in 2019 and booked a gain of approximately $375 million, without this sale Square would have been marginally GAAP profitable.Further, as we saw yesterday, Square used its high market valuation to price $1B of convertible notes. Given that Square's balance sheet already carried close to $1 billion of net cash, this latest fundraising points to Square having no clear sight on generating strong GAAP profitability anytime soon.Moreover, although Square reported adjusted EPS of $0.80 in 2019, it is guiding at the top end of its range towards $0.94 for 2020. In other words, the stock already trades for north of 80x adjusted EPS figures.Square's core operations appear to be losing some steam.However, its smaller segment, Cash App, continues to deliver very positive surprises.On balance, I fail to see how investors are likely to be rewarded by paying close to 85x forward earnings. Investors would do well to reconsider this opportunity once cheaper prices prevail."
4333915,104941,2020-03-24T13:46:27-04:00,"I lay out exactly what I've been buying and why these companies remain fantastic buys.I briefly demonstrate the thinking behind each of the buys, and I share more in-depth discussions of the companies, on which I've previously written (via links throughout the article).I rate ISRG, NOW, SQ, GOOG, and TWLO all strong buys.","Source: Mission Mindfulness BlogOk, now that you've taken a deep breath, prepare to enter a world of positivity and forward-looking optimism. In these difficult times, it may be tempting to walk away from your portfolios and bury your head in the sand, which some might believe is a valid strategy, as we could decline further from here.I am here today to offer you another perspective: Now is the time to go on the offensive and to pick your spots (or stocks if you will). Now is the time to be buying quality discounted companies, the likes of which you will find later in this article. Could we fall more from today's prices? Sure, we could. But the companies that I am about to share will almost certainly rebound strongly over the coming 6-12 months.I just quickly want to highlight my performance on nearly all of my calls over the past two months. Commenters on my recent Chipotle (CMG) article were quick to ensure accountability was upheld after it declined in line with the broad market. Interestingly, Chipotle is performing either at or above the market as of writing this article.I am sharing this not only to maintain self-accountability (I take my recommendations very seriously and only really write about stocks in which I've to invest my entire net-worth) but also to share with readers what good companies look like. These companies don't have 10%+ yields. They aren't penny stocks. They aren't companies that produce things like oil and tobacco (with which I don't take any issue, but they certainly aren't good investments). So here are some of my calls and their performance over the last two months.The majority of my calls over the past 2 months have outperformed the SPY; in that, their declines have been less than the declines of the overall market, against which my fund competes. Also, every stock I share in this article is now a very, very strong conviction buy.For example:Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) is down 24.32% versus the SPY's (SPY) decline of 27.52%. I re-iterated in the last week that this is a generational buying opportunity for Alphabet's shares.Source: My Coverage Tab in my Author ProfileLockheed Martin (LMT) is down 25.85% versus the SPY's decline of 26.42%. I re-iterated my buy recommendation on the stock in the last week or so.Source: My Coverage Tab in my Author ProfileServiceNow (NOW) is down 9.42% versus a decline of 17% by the SPY from where I originally recommended buying the stock. This is stock is lagging others, which is creating a very attractive entry point. More about this company later in this article.Source: My Coverage Tab in my Author ProfileAdobe (ADBE) is down 15.12% from where I recommended it versus a decline of 25.85% from the SPY.Source: My Coverage Tab in my Author ProfileAnd all of these stocks have become buying opportunities, of which I've been taking advantage. What's more, even if these stocks were bought last month, one should still expect their projected returns over a 10-year time span, and in many cases, these companies will return to growth as usual over the coming year or so.I share all of this not to boast, but rather to ensure the accountability my readers want. Just as you must pick good stocks, you should also pick good authors and advisors. To further this accountability, I want to share another example of me being ""on the right side of history"".I have been actively railing against tobacco stocks, oil stocks, and many of the ""get yield quick"" REIT schemes that curiously dominate Seeking Alpha, much to the detriment of investors. Again, I am sharing this so that readers understand what good stocks look like, and not just to feel good about myself. This crash should be instructive for those who may have been tempted to chase ""sucker yields"" that inevitably imploded.Here's some evidence of my position on the aforementioned:Source: My Comment HistoryMany of these ""high yield REITs"" (those that had yields in excess of 10%) are now down 60%-90%, and some have already slashed their dividends.And as for my opposition to oil stocks, here's the evidence for that. My comment history details my opposition to tobacco stocks also.I also want to be clear that I'm far from perfect.I've been bullish on Boeing (BA), which has proven to be a bad call; not because it's down, but because it now faces existential risk, which could become systematic risk to the economy if not properly addressed by the government.I'm glad you asked!Below you will find my top five buys to capitalize on this panic. If you'd like more recommendations from me, simply go through my past articles and look at the total expected return near the end of each article.What I've found very interesting in analyzing my past articles is the following. You will find a pretty direct correlation between expected return and level of decline experienced recently. That is, you will find that ""riskier"", less proven companies had higher expected returns than the more proven and stable companies. I did not create the valuations with that dynamic in mind, so it's interesting to see that my models' expected returns mirror the beta of each of the companies I've publicly examined.This dynamic also lends great credence and legitimacy to my L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, which you can see demonstrated in action here, or in most of my articles.Anyway, let's get into the analysis!I wrote at length about my in-person visit to the company and at length about the company as a whole here. In the article, I arrived at the conclusion that Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) would generate annualized returns of about 11% at a purchase price of ~$575. I then went on to say the following:So here we are, an all-in scenario.You can read my original piece on the stock to understand its future prospects for growth, which are still strongly intact; however, today, I will look at its balance sheet to assess the strength of the company's financial position.Here's a little look at it:Source: YChartsAs can be seen above, ISGR has $3.2B in cash on hand. This could cover its entire COGS, SG&A expense, and interest on debt expense for an entire year. What's more, its total liabilities are only about $1.4B, which makes for a very small interest expense. Therefore, ISRG has very little risk of bankruptcy and will likely resume normal operations in the coming weeks.Thus, ISRG is currently offering a value that likely won't come around ever again. That is, ISRG below $400 will generate well over 20% annualized returns over the coming decade, based on the math illustrated in my L.A. Stevens Valuation Model in my original article on the stock.I wrote at length about ServiceNow recently, after realizing that it is set to become the ""platform of platforms"" for thousands of major businesses. ServiceNow is the platform of platforms in the sense that the company provides the railways on which information within a business travels to and fro. From HR to IT, NOW digitizes the entire workplace experience on a simple, seamless platform.In my original piece on ServiceNow, I wrote about the ""business herd effect"", which theorizes that hockey stick growth is on the horizon for the company, as consulting agencies and competitive businesses realize that incredible efficiencies in IT, HR, and employee/customer interactions can be derived by using NOW's platform.The benefit of NOW is so incredibly clear now that I couldn't imagine CEOs not rushing to become subscribers. Take this scenario for example:Alright, so it's a great company, but what's going on with the financials?Here's a snapshot of the company's balance sheet:Source: YChartsWith $1.7B in cash on hand and $835M in receivables, NOW has positioned itself well to weather this storm and emerge even stronger, as companies realize that they must put their entire business' workflow in the cloud, which NOW enables.Further, once NOW becomes a part of a company, it becomes vital to the functioning of that company; therefore, it would be literally the last subscription a business would cancel, as doing so would destroy information flows exactly when businesses need them the most.Square (SQ) may be controversial for some, as the company will certainly be hit hard by this shutdown of the U.S. economy. However, the company has more than enough cash to weather this storm and emerge even stronger on the other side. What's more, it has shown that it has the right idea about recessions:Go on the offense while others are panicking and withdrawing!As evidence of this mentality, Jack Dorsey has taken to Twitter (TWTR) to announce that Square will be giving away money through its Cash App. This is going to cause an explosion in usage over the coming months, and hopefully, much of the usage will stick.Source: TwitterAdditionally, Jack has addressed how the company will support its small business owners, which will likely entail short term loans that will be repaid as a percentage of transactions over the coming 3 to 6 months.Source: TwitterTo bolster this position as a leader in a crisis, Square received approval for its bank charter recently. This approval means that Square's moat has become even larger.Competitors like Clover have bundled their offerings with banks, which made such an offering more appealing. Square has not had this advantaged (yet continues to dominate the landscape), but now, with the approval of its bank charter, there's much less incentive for merchants to use inferior offerings simply because they're attached to a bank and its many services, such as business credit cards. Square will now be the one-stop-shop for small business development.And Square is extremely well capitalized!Source: YChartsIt could exist for well over a year without a single dollar in revenue, all while paying its employees as usual. Hence, Square's declaration that it will start handing out money on its Cash App makes sense. Square was born in the great recession, and this recession will only empower the company further!Many of you are probably aware that I have been vocal about Alphabet's need to return capital to shareholders, especially when it's extremely attractive to do so during this temporary panic.Aside from that ideological position, I am a huge believer in the company due to explosive growth in YouTube and Google Cloud, both of which are growing well above 30% annually.According to my sum of parts valuation analysis in the article linked above, Alphabet remains undervalued by about 50% at its present valuation of around $750B. And I believe this undervaluation remains even in light of the inevitable revenue and free cash flow hit the company will take due to the virus-induced shutdown.Source: YChartsAs can be seen above, Alphabet currently trades at a valuation touched only at the very bottom of the great recession.New flash market! Alphabet is more profitable and better positioned than ever! This undervaluation highlights exactly why Alphabet needs to act decisively and execute an ASR (accelerated share repurchase), or begin strategically acquiring deeply discounted companies that could, for example, bolster its Cloud offering.Source: YChartsI wrote about Twilio (TWLO) when it was trading at about $120, stating that it was a great value at that price. The article was entitled ""6 Million Reasons Twilio Could Dominate The CPaas Industry"", and it detailed how Twilio's platform strategy would lead to a revolution in the space. So if it were a great value at that price, it's an unbelievable value at $70-$80, granted it can remain solvent, and I strongly believe it can/will.Further, the need for Twilio's services has never been higher!What Twilio DoesEssentially, Twilio provides a communications platform for businesses, whereby these businesses develop their own unique strategy for communication with customers, i.e., the companies communicate through some combination of text messages, Facebook (FB) messenger, email, app alerts, etc.Twilio's platform is used by many of the largest companies on earth, such as Home Depot (HD), Lyft (LYFT), Airbnb (AIRB), and many others. You can read a much more in-depth exploration of Twilio's business here.As for Twilio's solvency, the company has never been in a better position than today, as can be seen below.Source: YChartsWith $1.8B worth of cash and only $1B worth of expenses in the last year, Twilio could easily survive for a year without a drip of revenue dollars.But that's not how Twilio rolls! Twilio's services are predicated on a subscription model, and during a time when the need for communication between businesses and consumers/employees is at its highest, we can be pretty certain that Twilio will not lose many of its customers. In fact, it will likely yank market share out of the hands of inferior alternatives that exist within the communications platform as a service arena.At the risk of making this article unbearably long, I will conclude here. I urge any prospective investors in these companies to read my more in-depth reports so that you can develop a solid idea of what these companies do. Further, in each of my linked articles, you will find precise expected returns. As I mentioned, you will notice that the higher the expected return, the larger the decline in the stock. This proves two things: 1) My L.A. Stevens Valuation Model provides high fidelity projections (but doesn't necessarily guarantee that these projections will come to fruition), and 2) higher expected returns = greater risk (or beta in finance parlance). This means that the higher the expected return, the greater the company will diverge from the performance of the SPY. Such has been the case for Uber (UBER), on which I remain bullish, as it has declined well in excess of the broader market, but that also may be as a result of it being a transportation company.Remember, just because the market is selling off aggressively does not mean the market has any idea what tomorrow has in store for us. President Trump's aid packages could avert a recession, or they could prove to be not enough and could plunge us deeply into another great recession.Whatever transpires, all of the stocks listed in this article have fantastic cash positions that will enable them to survive this downturn and even emerge stronger on the other side!Here's a quote I will leave you with:As always, thanks for reading; please remember to follow for more, and happy investing!"
4332664,100666,2020-03-18T03:22:08-04:00,"Square has fallen ridiculously low, to levels not seen for years and down 50% in just three weeks.If you aim for tenbaggers, a 20% price difference now is just 2% if it becomes a tenbagger, so don't try to time too much.There are proper reasons that Square is down, but the issues will not have an influence for the long term.The real driver behind Square is not the POS hardware but Cash App and the integration possibility of the two ecosystems.There is a lot of optionality in Square: international expansion, advertising, adding new products and much more.","This market is wild, really wild. In just three weeks, the markets took a gigantic dive, totaling 25% after the small rebound of Tuesday.Data by YChartsThe Fed has jumped in on Sunday, basically bringing interest rates to zero and reintroducing QE. Despite this action (or maybe because of it), the markets dived again as if there's no future, wiping out all of the gains of Friday and more.It seems that the crowdsourced wisdom of Twitter did its work. On Friday, after the 10% rally, I posted a poll.(Source)I was of the same opinion, and I wrote that to my subscribers. That means that I refrained from doing anything on Friday. I did buy shares on Monday, though. I bought shares of Square (SQ) at $45. Although I found that an incredible price, the stock went down even more at the end of the day, eventually touching $40.I have a policy of not trying to time the bottom or the top. It's a fool's game, since no one can do it unless they are really lucky. I keep my positions for a very long time and add to them when I can.I believe that Square could go up at least 10 times in value. That's why it's a Potential Multibagger. If the stock price is $450 in 2030 and you have bought at $53.5 or at $45, that's a difference of just 1.6%. So, while the difference is much more now (16%), it becomes smaller and smaller the longer you hold your stocks. If you realize this, you can make it so much easier for yourself.I have written 6 previous articles about Square over the last year. If you have read any of them (thanks!), you know that I am bullish on the stock over the long term - the only term that matters to me. The quick sell-off only made me more bullish, because the only valuable argument that you could make about the stock is that it was fully priced (though not excessively so, in my opinion). Now that argument is down the drain. The company now trades at a P/S just north of 4.(Source)The stock is now back to levels not seen for years:Data by YChartsA lot of growth stocks have been hammered down, but Square even more. This is its price evolution over the last three weeks:Data by YChartsIn my opinion, this is a typical market overreaction. At the end of February, Square released its Q4 2019 results and they looked really good. That's why the stock jumped almost 5% after the earnings were released:Data by YChartsNow, not even three weeks later, the stock would only be worth half of what it was worth then? Come on...One of the best things to do as a real investor (which is inherently for the long term) is to look at the business numbers without looking at the stock price at all. If you don't know the stock price, would you hold the company based on the business results alone? If the answer is yes, just hold the stock and don't sell, no matter if it is overpriced or undervalued.If you didn't know what company this was and you would see this chart, would you be tempted to sell it if you had it in your portfolio? I know I wouldn't.And this is the growth of this anonymous company's gross margins:Don't these metrics look a lot better without the price, which often distracts us from seeing the fundamentals? Too many investors base their judgment on what the price of a stock does, not on how the business performs.Now, of course, the stock I showed you was Square. If you plot the two against each other, you can see that the stock price is underperforming versus revenue growth:Data by YChartsI have seen in more than one stock that these are the best times to buy. And that's one of the reasons I added to my position at $45 yesterday. I also added a few shares at $53.5 last week.Don't get me wrong. I'm not an all-is-rosy investor. There are serious reasons why Square stock is hit so hard. Covid-19 will have a tremendous impact on the economy in general and on the company in particular.Covid-19 keeps spreading like wildfire, and governments around the world have stepped in to prevent the disease from doing even more harm. Many bars, restaurants and shops have been closed. Those places are an important part of Square's customer base. And I wouldn't be surprised to see a full lockdown, which would hit the company's SMB base even more. Square's main source of profit, for now, is its POS (point-of-sale) hardware. (Source)So, there's no doubt in my mind that Square's revenue and profitability will be hit in the short term. The real question is: how much will this influence its long-term opportunities?The worst-case scenario for Square (and for everyone) would be that a lot of SMBs would go bankrupt because the Covid-19 pandemic doesn't go away soon enough. At this moment, everybody seems to expect that the coronavirus will be conquered somewhere around May or earlier. But suppose it would take six months or more, that would be devastating for a lot of SMBs (and larger companies too, by the way). In that case, Square could have a problem. But not just Square. If that happens, the whole economy is in shreds. Eventually, though, the economy will recover, as it has always done.A positive for Square is that people are encouraged to pay contactless in this environment, which means that Cash App will gain traction once the Covid-19 storm is over. Once you are used to paying contactless, you don't go back.I have argued before that that Cash App is more important for Square than the POS hardware. For those who don't know Cash App, it is basically a mobile app that allows you to transfer money, mostly smaller amounts, to another individual via the app or via email.Cash App was the shining star of the Q4 earnings again. Revenue of Cash App went up 147% YoY, reaching $361 million for the quarter. The number of users also rose impressively, by 60% YoY, to 24 million.(Source)As far as I know, this is the only app that you can use to pay with bitcoin as well, and stock trading has been introduced to the platform too. I have already argued that this is a very strong new feature and it will add again to the strength of the ecosystem. Square's CEO Jack Dorsey said about Cash App on the Q3 2019 conference call:I think it's very important to realize this. Young people will use Cash App from when they are young and will continue to use Cash App, disrupting services that were traditionally done by banks. Square will extend its use cases according to the demand. It's not a coincidence that the company has applied for a banking license. The adoption of the investing platform on Cash App confirms that the users ask for new features. Jack Dorsey said about the stock trading feature on the Q4 2019 conference call:In August 2018, just 18 months after its launch, Square's Cash App surpassed the number of downloads of PayPal's (PYPL) Venmo, which was launched in 2008 and was seen as the big winner in the space before Cash App came to the scene. Cash App has stayed the #1 in the downloaded financial apps ever since. This is the Google Play store ranking from 5 days ago for financial apps:And for Q4 2019, this is the top 20 of all downloaded apps, not just financials. If you see which giants Cash App features between (and has been consistently over the last two years), I think you get a better view of the possibilities:(Source)Still, a lot of investors and analysts believe Venmo is the clear winner, which it is not. While I like Venmo as well (I'm long PayPal, too), Cash App is rapidly becoming the market leader in the non-banking mobile payment service industry. And Cash App can monetize its users better and better. From the Q4 2019 conference call:A growing customer base combined with more and more monetization. That's a very strong flywheel for Square. And it still has a lot of optionalities.Very important is that Square still has a lot of options to grow. It is the proud owner of not one but two ecosystems: the merchant system and that of consumers (with Cash App). Jack Dorsey understands this all too well. The development of the two ecosystems, and especially the combination of the two, gives Square a huge runway for growth.The CEO had this to say on the Q3 2019 conference call:Another option for scaling Cash App? Advertising. Just imagine that merchants can advertise on Cash App, based on the transactions that users make. That's so much more powerful than Google (GOOG, GOOGL) or Facebook (FB) do because Square can look at the actual purchases. It's like Amazon's (AMZN) advertising business. That company, of course, also knows very well what you buy. Of course, Square is not of Amazon's size. Amazon had a total of $3.6 billion in advertising income in Q3 2019 with total revenue of $70 billion. So, that's about 5% that comes from advertising. For Cash App, that would be around $80 million of extra income, and that would certainly grow over the years. Most of it would go directly to the bottom line.Square could also use loyalty programs and many more products and services to tie the two ecosystems together.And then, there's the international opportunity. The seller ecosystem is rolled out slowly internationally. It has only been introduced in the UK, Canada, Australia, and Japan. But the results look very promising. Again, from the Q4 2019 conference call:Square has also rolled out Cash App for the UK, and now you can send or request payments with friends located there. The currency is converted automatically, and there are no fees to send a payment. This is another example of how Cash App can keep expanding.So, again, this shows how Square can grow exponentially internationally over the coming years.Adding Square at these prices is giving yourself a gift that you can only unwrap years from now. The fact that the company's two ecosystems have not been tied together yet, and that internationally Square is only scratching the surface, are just a few clear signs that Square's story is just only starting out and has a long runway to grow. Much more than the POS hardware, Cash App will be the driver for Square for years to come.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from a long-term perspective, feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4328869,22148,2020-03-02T14:14:54-05:00,Square rallied following soft 2020 guidance due likely to a confusion over net and adjusted revenues.Revenue guidance suggests only 25% growth this year.The stock trades at a very rich 76x EBITDA targets.,"Square (SQ) has a lot of moving parts in their revenue numbers so the stock rallying on Q4 numbers and more specifically on disappointing 2020 guidance has investors chasing false revenue hype again. Despite the U.S. stock markets crashing over 10%, the stock is near recent highs. My investment thesis remains negative at this valuation due to the likelihood the market doesn't understand the presented revenue metrics and the ramifications.Image Source: Square website A few months back along with the Q3 earnings report, Square announced the company would no longer report adjusted revenue due to SEC guidance. The focus on adjusted revenues impacted related margins reported to investors, but the metric was very useful to strip out transaction-based costs. In addition, the net revenues includes pass-through bitcoin trading costs offering zero-calorie revenues to Square.The jump in revenues for the Cash App is a reason to be bullish on the long term of Square while the GPV continues to decelerate in a negative signal. The big problem with the Cash App revenue is the inclusion of Bitcoin net revenues and now stock trading.The problem is the inflated revenues without the benefits misleads investors into thinking the fintech has this large revenue growth. For Q4, Square reported the following Cash App numbers:In essence, half of the revenues and a substantial amount of the boost from last Q4 were passthrough bitcoin trading costs. A prime example of how net revenues aren't a useful metric considering bitcoin had $178 million in quarterly revenues and only $3 million in gross profits.Even using the total net revenue metric, Square is forecasting a sharp slowdown in 2020 revenue growth. Excluding Caviar, the company had 2019 net revenues of $4.57 billion. The 2020 target of $5.9 billion only produces 29% growth, down significantly from 45% last year.Source: Square Q4'19 shareholder letter These net revenue numbers just aren't useful (thanks SEC). Luckily, Square provided investors with 2020 transaction-based costs of $3.1 billion.The adjusted revenue guidance is $2.8 billion to $2.845 billion. The analyst consensus was for adjusted revenues of $2.87 billion suggesting Square will actually miss consensus estimates.Data by YChartsThe actual suggestion from the stock rally is that investors are confusing the net revenue target of $5.9 billion with the adjusted revenue analyst target of $2.87 billion. The Cash App numbers were so bullish due to the bitcoin trading that some investors clearly though the company was guiding up substantially.What still drives the real revenue growth is GPV. Square is now down to 25% growth and all signs point to further deceleration in 2020. Even the shift to larger sellers isn't preventing the lower growth rates.Source: Square Q4'19 shareholder letterRegardless of whether the revenue picture is confusing or overhyped, investors can clearly just look at the EBITDA targets to value the stock. Square generated $417 million adjusted EBITDA for 2019 and guided to only $510 million in 2020.Due to this shift towards reporting adjusted revenues, it appears that investors jumped on the large net revenue target of $5.9 billion in comparison to the adjusted revenue figure below $2.85 billion. The odd part of this reality was the acknowledgement that Square would miss consensus EPS estimates of $0.95 by up to $0.05.The targeted EBITDA growth rate is only in the 22% range while the stock trades at 76x EBITDA estimates for 2020. With 485 million diluted shares outstanding, Square has a market valuation of $39 billion with the stock up at $80.Square is a prime example of where financial websites don't always list the fully diluted share count. Due to GAAP reported losses, the company only lists ~430 million shares outstanding causing a lot of websites to list a market value of only $34 billion.The hype was further exasperated by the suggestion that Square is an acquisition target. According to Investors.com, Lisa Ellis, analyst at MoffettNathanson, views Square as a takeover target:Investors shouldn't think any large financial institution is going to pay over $50 billion to acquire the fintech. Note, a 50% premium price would require a $60 billion price tag and one probably shouldn't expect the company to accept a deal below this premium requiring an all-time high offer of $120. PayPal Holdings (PYPL) only has a market cap of $127 billion.The key investor takeaway is that Square initially rallied on what appears to be a misinterpretation of 2020 revenue guidance. The company has a bright future, but investors are paying up far too much for limited growth metrics.My value target still suggests the stock should trade no more than 50x EBITDA targets or the equivalent of ~$50."
4318883,86786,2020-01-24T10:38:06-05:00,Unprofitable companies on the verge of profitability but with low expectations are rare gems for long earnings trades; Square is one such company.I calculate a price target of $95 for Square in 2020.I offer an options strategy for those wishing to go long on Square into earnings.,"I usually would not call a company with a 54 price-per-free-cash-flow valuation a Phoenix play, but by many measures it does meet my requirements for a stock that is more likely to rally hard on earnings than fall hard. Overpriced stocks can still be Phoenix plays if they have catalysts for downside pressure. For example, perhaps sentiment is low, or the stock is being pressured downward for some reason (e.g., excessive shorts or share dilution), or perhaps the potential upside is simply larger than the potential downside.One example of a downward pressure catalyst is in SQ seeing its outstanding shares increase over 5% the past year, creating dilution and thereby driving down investor sentiment:(Source: Macrotrends)In addition, my favorite value factor ratio EBITDA/EV, while objectively high for SQ, is not high for SQ within the industry. Some might consider this company strictly a payment-processing business due to its profit sources, but for the purposes of analyzing it for an earnings play, which relies more on quantitative analysis than fundamental business analysis, we best consider Square within the industry it correlates most closely to, which is financial technology (i.e., more of a software company, such as Intuit, than a pure financial services company, such as Visa). We can see that SQ correlates more strongly to fintech stocks than financial service stocks by comparing it to the iShares Financial Services ETF (IYG) and to the Global X Fintech ETF (FINX):(Correlation matrix; source: Portfolio Visualizer)The point here is that SQ’s EBITDA/EV seems low when observed within a vacuum but not when observed within its industry, where it is relatively high. If you judge a stock by its EBITDA/EV ratio alone, most software/IT/fintech/etc. companies would not be labeled Phoenix plays. However, once you investigate this metric within an industry subset, you can locate those with the EBITDA/EV ratios (though low with respect to the general market) that appear high for the industry, allowing you to find the best long earnings plays offering a decent upside skew; this, in addition with other factors suppressing the stock, allows for us to find Phoenix plays in overpriced industries.Then, we have the recent price action. SQ has underperformed the information technology (IT) market by 80% in the past year. It has also managed to fall more than 1% during a strong week for the overall market (though the market is now flat due to Friday’s politically based fears).SQ’s underperformance has led to lower expectations for its next earnings report. This is good for a Phoenix play. The fact that the stock is also trading well under its discounted cash flow valuation is also a bullish catalyst; it is clearly underpriced when you consider its future cash flows, as I’ll briefly explain below (see my other articles or this article for a more in-depth calculation).SQ has a beta of .98. Multiply this by the equity risk premium for the market, which is currently 5.5%, and add it to the risk-free rate (1.7% for US 10-year bonds). You get a cost of equity of 7.1% for SQ.You can then extrapolate analysts’ levered FCF estimates for SQ over the next ten years, multiplying them by the cost of equity to get the present value of that FCF. For example, the present value of the levered FCF expected for 2020 is $450.74M discounted by 7.1%, or $418.74M.Sum those values to get the total value of the future free cash flows (discounted). Then, divide that number by the number of outstanding shares. The final value I arrived at was $43,700M / 466M, or a fair value of $94.78 per share.That gives the stock a 49% upside to fair value (at the time of writing, Jan6). This large upside might be surprising but does make sense if SQ is able to continue its current trend financial trends. SQ’s revenue growth is strong as well as stable, and comes with economies of scale, which are actively helping free cash flow accelerate while operating expenses remain relatively flat:(Source: Simply Wall St)As a Phoenix play, the upside reward surpasses the downside risk. Still, as with any stock, SQ has the possibility of falling. The options market can help us predict a possible fall prior to a certain time, via the price of an at-the-money straddle at a certain expiration date. Currently $7.35 is the implied movement the options market is pricing. Thus, a $7.35 reduction of the stock can act as your guideline for the magnitude of downside risk over earnings.This is a sustainable trend that comes with little risk, as the company’s short-term assets ($2.76B) cover both its short- and long-term liabilities ($1.64B and $1.11B, respectively). While debt remains high, SQ’s equity growth is exceeding its debt growth, as below. The company will certainly be looking much more healthy in the coming quarters, especially when you acknowledge this trend in addition to the company’s ROE trend, the trajectory of which will make the company highly profitable:(Source: Simply Wall St)Unprofitable companies on the verge of profitability but with low expectations are rare. SQ, underpriced, with its 3-year cash runway, and with FCF growing at an 80% rate, is certainly a good Phoenix play, as the first sign of profitability is likely to drive many conservative investors and value hunters to the stock. The historic Sharpe ratio (the difference between the stock’s return and risk-free rate, divided by the square root of the variance of the stock’s returns) of holding SQ over the first quarter is 68, implying a risk/reward curve strongly in favor of the bulls in early 2020.The options market is more bullish than bearish both for the general market and for SQ:(Source: E-Trade Pro)And option prices are finally becoming fairer. For now, options are a bit overpriced, but this means you can go with credit-focused strategies (option strategies that are opened at a net credit, not debit), which we occasionally play over earnings but not often into earnings. The good news is that the separation of the statistical and implied volatility of options in early December is waning, which means that long calls will become more reasonably priced quite soon:(Source: E-Trade Pro)For now, you can consider buying deep ITM calls and selling OTM calls, which have higher theta values, to capitalize on an upward movement while avoiding falling into the premium trap of the options market on SQ at the present. Here is a possible strategy:You can roll over the short calls every two weeks, at strikes roughly $5 above the underlying. You can buy back the short leg right before earnings, holding long the ITM call. This gives you the ability to mimic holding SQ stock over earnings while still gaining time premium via the short calls.Happy trading!"
4315450,71685,2020-01-06T13:58:43-05:00,Square has witnessed some bullish option flow in recent days.The technical chart suggests momentum is shifting.Forward guidance may be the biggest risk.,"Square's (SQ) stock may be ready to rise to start 2020 despite a lousy ending to 2019. The stock has seen some bullish option flow in recent days that indicate the stock can increase by as much as 22% by the end of March. It could amount to a big jump for the stock if everything goes correctly.It is not to say there aren't some who think the stock won't perform well in the future. The sell-side analyst's shop, Wolfe Research, downgraded the stock to Peer Perform from Outperform with a $70 price target on January 6.In a side note, you can track all of my free articles written on Square and Seeking Alpha on this Google Spreadsheet I created.On January 2, the open interest level for the Square March 20 $75 calls rose by roughly 10,700 contracts. The data provided by Trade Alert indicated that the call contracts traded on the ASK, a sign that a trader bought the calls. The data shows the trader purchased the contracts for around $0.85. That would mean that the stock would need to rise to approximately $75.85 to break even, a gain of roughly 22.9% by the expiration date from the stock's current price of $61.74 on January 6.The technical chart is also pointing to a stock that is likely to rise in the future. The shares have found a meaningful level of technical support in the $60.50 to $61 region. Currently, the stock is stuck in a trading channel that is taking it lower. However, should the stock break above the downtrend and resistance at $63, then it could rally to around $67.35, a gain of about 9%.More importantly, the relative strength index is flashing bullish trends. It has been steadily trending higher since the middle of August and serves as an indication that positive momentum is finally entering the shares.The recent analyst downgrade for the stock is just one negative overhang on the company. The most significant overhang, as noted previously, is the company's history of disappointing investors come earnings time. Historically, the company has delivered better-than-expected results only to issue weaker-than-expected guidance, which has negatively hurt the performance of the stock. It also presents one of the most significant risks when it comes to future stock performance.Additionally, analysts have been trimming their earnings estimates for the company in 2020 and 2021. Since the beginning of 2019, analysts' earnings estimates have declined by 13% and 25%, respectively. That has brought forecasts for 2020 down to just $0.96 per share and $1.34 per share in 2021.With earnings estimates falling, the stock's valuation remains very high, especially when compared to peers, at 48 times 2021 estimates. Compare that to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which trades at 26 times 2021 earnings, or Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) at 20.4, it makes Square look extremely expensive. It also means that Square's valuation doesn't allow any room for earnings estimates to fall further and zero space for it to issue weak guidance when it reports results in February.For now, there is hope that Square can rebound off its weak finish to 2019 with the potential for a momentum shift. But for any bullish momentum to last beyond February, its next earnings date, the company is going to need to do something it typically doesn't, beat analysts' expectations, and raise guidance."

I provide three stocks to pick up today.I begin with a discussion regarding the Fed's recent operations. The next two bullet points highlight the main ideas of the discussion.Since the Fed began pumping money into the repo market in October of 2019 via ""Not QE"", the market has soared to record highs.The Fed has made no indication that they plan to stop their ""Not QE"" operations anytime soon and may even cut their target rate again in the future.LMT, SQ, and AVGO are fantastic businesses that still represent value in the U.S.' frothy, central bank fueled market.","Since mid-October, the Fed has been executing a generous ""Not QE"" policy. Fed Chairman Powell was quoted as saying, ""This is not QE... In no sense is this QE."" Despite the Fed's curious moniker for their current operations, their latest policy entails lower target interest rates and injecting liquidity into the repo market. The repo market is essentially where institutions, such as hedge funds and banks, access liquidity quickly.So, with the Fed injecting cash into the financial system at a rate comparable to post-crisis QE, assets will, with more or less assurance, continue to inflate, as they have done for the last decade. Many stocks have already had astronomical rises in the past 12 months; however, there are still pockets of value yet to be traded into the stratosphere. Here are a few that still have room to run!Lockheed Martin (LMT) is the largest defense contractor by revenues derived from defense contracts. However, ""defense contractor"" may not be the perfect moniker by which to call the company any longer. An aeronautical defense agency might be more fitting.According to their 10-Q, they operate in four segments; into which they segment their revenues:Source: Lockheed Martin Q3 2019 10-QHistorically, Lockheed Martin has been known as a defense contractor, and such is borne out by their ""Missiles and Fire Control"" and ""Rotary and Mission Systems"" segment, both of which have been growing steadily.But I love the stock for their orientation to the skies, where massive growth is set to occur literally indefinitely for mankind. As can be seen above, Lockheed Martin's aeronautics and space divisions grew at 12.7% and 9.6% respectively. With the introduction of the United States' Space Force, look for dollars from the government to be funneled into Lockheed Martin's coffers, and in turn, into your portfolio!The stock, as of January 20, 2020, trades at a substantial discount to its 5-year median price to free cash flow. Lockheed Martin's present valuation rests at about a 14.67% discount to its 5y median valuation. Look for the stock to test that valuation level in the coming months, which implies 17.2% upside from here.Source: YCharts.comAdditionally, Lockheed Martin's valuation has been depressed relative to their peers, likely as a result of lower free cash flow due to an acceleration in spending on working capital. However, I see this as a short-term headwind, setting Lockheed Martin up for a strong, secular share price increase in the coming years.Source: YCharts.comLMT: The King Of BuybacksIf the secular growth trend of mankind's forays into space and undervaluation relative to their usual valuation haven't swayed you, then maybe their generous capital return programs will! As you can see below, Lockheed Martin has bought back an astounding ~30% of their outstanding shares over the last ten years.Source: YChartsFew other companies can boast such generous capital return programs while maintaining robust growth in their top and bottom lines. In addition, Lockheed Martin has steadily increased their dividend over the same time period.Source: YChartsYes, Lockheed Martin has had a substantial run up from their lows during the Christmas Massacre of 2018, but for this aeronautics and defense behemoth, there's still more room to run this year and into the coming decades! Pick up this lifetime hold and set it to DRIP for multi-decade investment horizons.LMT: Discounted Cash Flow ModelSource: YChartsAs you can see in the above DCF model, Lockheed Martin is being substantially undervalued relative to their potential for free cash flow growth and generation over the coming decade. 15% growth may be generous, but with the effects of another 30% of shares being bought back, it may actually be conservative.If you'd like to read more about why I love defense stocks and why we are about to see a secular increase in defense spending globally, check out my article here. All of my opinions regarding these stocks are largely informed by my time serving as an Engineer Officer in the U.S. Army and my long-term study of geopolitics.At this point, I'm getting a bit tired of shouting to the world through my recent articles about Square's (SQ) present undervaluation, which has been brought on by their superstar CFO's recent departure and their CEO's questionable behavior, as well as narratives about their business being eaten alive by competition.However, Square's negative narratives and present valuation belie the company's fantastic underlying financials. The company has been growing their revenues at upwards of 40% yoy for the last 5 years, and despite calls for competition destroying their business, gross margins have been improving. For a company that allegedly operates in an ultra-competitive space, their 40% gross margins are sure curious.Square's present sales growth rate of 40+% yoy and 40% gross margins, along with stable, growing free cash flow, are being vastly undervalued relative to the company's peers.Source: YChartsIn the above chart, we see Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) valued at 36x sales, while growing their sales at 44% yoy. In contrast, we see Square valued at 6.9x sales, while growing their last quarter sales at 43.57% yoy. Additionally, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), at 8.1x sales, grew their sales at 18% last quarter. With 40% gross margins at Square, it doesn't take a financial savant to tell that the market is grossly undervaluing Square's fantastic core business: supplying a POS solution that takes care of inventory management, employee management, and data analytics.SQ: Discounted Cash Flow ModelSource: YChartsConservatively, Square's share price could reach $120, and I would not bat an eyelid. This may take some time, but Square's day will come.If you'd like a very in-depth discussion regarding Square, check out my ""Square Vs. Shopify: Buy This One"" article where I take a deep dive into the two companies.Broadcom (AVGO) is a chip stock that combines two formerly separate entities, Avago and Broadcom, into one company; the combination of which boasts a highly diverse portfolio of products used primarily in communication devices. The stock is prominently featured in ETFs such as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) and the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH).Perhaps to a greater extent than any other company, Broadcom has been in the crosshairs of the U.S.-China trade tensions. 50% of the company's revenue during 2017 and 2018 was derived from China; however, that number was reduced to 35% in 2019. Meanwhile, Broadcom has been consistently growing their free cash flow per share through strategic acquisitions of CA Technologies and Symantec.Source: Broadcom Company Overview FY19Due to the headwinds, the company has faced in their core semiconductor business as a result of U.S./China tensions, their valuation has become depressed to a decade low.Source: YChartsBroadcom, currently, trades at a 37.12% discount to their 5-year median price to free cash flow, which means the stock's valuation would need to increase 59% in order to reach its historic median valuation. As we've discussed Broadcom faces headwinds, to be sure, but these headwinds don't warrant a discount of 37.12%, especially in light of management's guidance for $25B in revenues for 2020, which would represent an 11% yoy increase.In addition to Broadcom's U.S.-China headwinds, the company is going through a value-depressing strategic shift in their business, where they have distanced themselves from complete reliance on the often volatile chip market. To read more about their strategic shift in-depth and why you should pick up this blue chip dividend payer, check out my recent article entitled, ""Broadcom: Oil Might Be Dead But Chips Are Just Getting Started"".Lockheed Martin, Square, and Broadcom are three of my favorite stocks in my portfolio, although they have not performed as well as their peers, in large part due to very temporary headwinds that pose not long term threat to their businesses. Nothing has materially changed for the stocks for their valuations to re-rate as they have. That is, their free cash flows are still growing steadily and their core businesses are humming along as they've always.When jumping into quality stocks that are facing temporary setbacks or just being mispriced by the market, it helps to remind ourselves of the philosophies of the greatest investors of our time:- Warren BuffettAnd to close, I want to be clear on my ratings for all three of these stocks. I am very bullish on LMT, SQ, and AVGO.Happy investing and let me know what you think!"
4323357,104809,2020-02-12T04:17:17-05:00,"Digital Banks as the future of banking with low CAC, popular option among the unbanked and ability to leverage AI and big data.Square's Cash App has made consistent steps in becoming a viable alternative to traditional banks thus allowing monetization to turn the corner and ramp up.The future is bright for the Cash App and it needs to continue to show that it is able to add more banking features such as credit cards and consumer loans.","Square (SQ) is one of my bigger position in my portfolio and I've been continuously adding to it since the last quarter as I believe that Square has pulled ahead in its development as a digital bank. Square's recent sale of Cavier is also acknowledgement that it needs to focus on its core business (seller's business/ecosystem) and its increasingly important Cash App (buyer's business/ecosystem).Square's Cash App started out in 2013 as a competitor to the popular P2P services offered by PayPal's (PYPL) Venmo which allowed users to easily transfer money between friends. However, the end goal has never been just creating a P2P app but rather develop its Cash App into a viable alternative to traditional banks as a digital bank.After taking a look at the research presented by ARK Invest and the success of various global digital bank offerings, I am confident that digital banks such as what Cash App is working towards is the future of banking for several reasons.1. Low Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) thus higher marginsIn its Q3 report, Square reported that Cash App had gross margins of 76% and had improved margins every year since monetization efforts began in 2017. Its ability to maintain and even increase its gross margins is twofold - firstly low CAC and secondly increasing average revenue per user once they're part of the Cash App ecosystem. ARK Investment Management has produced a very comprehensive report demonstrating Cash App's low CAC vis-à-vis traditional banks who traditionally have high CAC due to the need to maintain physical retail locations, staff and infrastructure. The below image clearly demonstrates the high costs in acquiring a single customer depending on financial service. On the other hand, not only does Square not have to maintain expensive physical retail locations and a large staff, it has cleverly utilised very effective viral marketing strategies to acquire customers. According to ARK, Cash App has employed a very effective Twitter marketing strategy called Cash App Fridays where users reply to the Cash App’s tweets with their Cash Tags and receive funds if selected by its marketing team. Occasionally, users can stand to win large sums ($10,000) of money which is a great way to get users to try out the app.ARK also identified other effective marketing strategies such as ""partnered marketing campaigns with brands, celebrities (Travis Scott & Lil B), podcasts and even e-sport teams. In one example, the Cash App partnered with Burger King on an offer to pay off the student debt of selected Twitter users. Nearly 100,000 users qualified by tweeting their Cash Tags to Burger King."" ARK estimates that in contrast to the $925 that retail banks pay to acquire a single customer, Cash App is able to acquire a single customer for less than $20 (calculated by taking Square's marketing & sales expenses)2. Popular option among the unbanked due to convenienceThe 2017 report by the FDIC indicates that there still remains 20 million unbanked Americans. ARK presents an extremely compelling argument that traditional banks will not be interested in targeting the unbanked due to the economics. The average annual income of the unbanked is slightly over $18,000 suggesting that it would not be profitable for traditional retail banks to target the unbanked due to high CAC.Further proof of Cash App's popularity among the unbanked was illustrated by ARK who showed that Cash App dominates in the southern states where the rates of the unbanked are highest.3. Ability to leverage big data and AI to benefit consumers The 2019 report on 'How AI and Big Data will Transform Banking in 2019' suggests that there are 5 ways in which banking will be transformed by big data and AI of which digital banks such as Square are at the forefront. Even if Cash App might not be offering such services, I believe that because it's a mobile and digital offering, it will have an advantage in terms of access to customer data and behavioral trends. This will allow digital banks to lead the way in terms of leveraging AI and big data to:Management has long touted the potential for Cash App to be the alternative to traditional banks. In 2018, then CFO Sarah Friar said:I believe that given recent developments and additional features now available in Cash App has shown that Square's vision for Cash App is increasingly becoming a reality. This has allowed it to truly turn the corner in terms of its path towards monetization (over $600 million annualized run rate vs. Venmo's $300 million).According to management, there are currently a half dozen drivers in Cash App's monetization but the two primary drivers are Instant Deposit and Cash Card.Cash App Banking Features As previously mentioned, my confidence and bullishness in Square's Cash App is in part due to its recent developments where it is providing an increasing number of services that is traditionally associated with banking. Another reason for my bullishness is that it has demonstrated on multiple occasions the ability to innovate in terms of financial products and services.While Cash App might have made progress in terms of releasing more banking features, I believe that it is nowhere close to being done. This was emphasized by Jack Dorsey in the recent earnings Q&A:This would be a discussion on what future developments I am hoping and want to see in order to cement Cash App's potential as a digital bank leader.Firstly, it needs to get a banking license which previously applied for in 2017 but withdrew its application in order to address regulator's questions. The recent development in which Axios reported that Varo had received FDIC approval and will be the first ""to receive the first de novo national bank charter ever given to a fintech startup"" hence demonstrating that digital banks receiving FDIC approval is not impossible. This approval will allow Varo to accept customer deposits.Secondly, a banking license would allow Square's Cash App to provide more traditionally banking services such as a Credit Card offering, providing loans to consumers and allowing customers to earn interest on their deposits.One need only look at China's Ant Financial to see that digital banks will be able to not only offer many banking features but do them better. For example, Ant Financial has an online lending platform, MyBank and the world's largest mutual fund, Yu'e Bao which allows users to invest for small amounts. It also allows for cross-border payments with small fees. According to Applico, ""Ant Financial also offers other financial services through ecosystems for insurance, credit, loans, credit scoring, and wealth management to that captive audience. What’s interesting about Ant Financial is how it has managed to mine gold from its Alipay customer base and use that data to create multiple interlocking platform businesses in financial services."" Ant Financial ($150 billion valuation) is ultimately the model that Square is working towards to and is the future of digital banking and fintech."
4318182,104941,2020-01-21T19:17:53-05:00,"Anti-Amazon refers to Shopify's recent acquisition of 6 River Systems, which enables merchants on Shopify's platform to offer two-day shipping through a service called ""Fulfillment by Shopify"".In this article, I explore the valuation of Shopify and Square by providing my forecast for margins and ultimately free cash flow.With around five years of public, financial data under our belts for these companies, creating a conservative discounted cash flow model is possible but not exactly easy.I maintain that the market is misvaluing Square. I alter my perspective on Shopify in light of their new fulfillment offering.","Source: The Motley FoolAs the bullet points related, this article is a follow-up to my original article: Square Vs. Shopify: Buy This One. In that article, I recommended Square (SQ) over Shopify (SHOP), and had you gone with Square, you wouldn't have done half bad.Source: SeekingAlpha.comThat's a 13.46% gain over SPY's 3.56% gain in the same period (the last three weeks). However, you would've done even better had you bought Shopify, which generated a gain of 14.41% in the same period. But none of that is too relevant, considering I advocate for buy and hold with a time horizon of at least 10 years to an entire lifetime.Before I dive into this article, I want to be clear about my position on both of these stocks: long term, their share prices will appreciate from where they are today. However, as of today, I rate Square a conviction buy and Shopify as just bullish, though any pullbacks will bring me into the very bullish camp of Shopify.In light of Shopify's recent rapid move upward, I continued to revise my perspective on the stock. Perhaps, there was something I missed, apropos the Shopify narrative, that caused the share price to rocket upward, even at 33x sales. After much consideration, I arrived at the conclusion that Shopify is on the precipice of creating the first e-commerce platform for businesses looking to sell direct-to-consumer that will be capable of rivaling Amazon (AMZN): The Anti-Amazon, if you will.In today's article, I will explore in-depth the underlying financial realities for the two companies, through an analysis of their margins and their projected free cash flow, which will begin sometime in the 2020s. Additionally, I will discuss Shopify's recent acquisition of 6 River Systems, by which the company has widened their moat for merchants looking to sell online to an unprecedented extent.Shopify and Square approach the same business from two different perspectives. That is, Shopify built their offering primarily through an online platform and has since expanded their physical offering through products such as their sleek retail POS. On the other hand, Square built their offering primarily through a physical, brick and mortar POS and has recently expanded into an online platform, via their acquisition of Weebly; though, as we will see, this offering cannot come close to rivaling Shopify's online offering.Both of the companies are focusing on enabling their customers (read: business owners) to execute an omnichannel selling strategy. But every business is different; therefore, different businesses will prefer Shopify or Square for different reasons.If you'd like to read more about the differences in the offerings of Shopify and Square, read more here.Margins are a great way to identify the extent to which a company possesses an economic moat. When margins, gross and operating, are growing or stable at 25%, 30%, or higher, you can be certain that they have some ability to command pricing power. When margins are low, i.e., 10% or lower, then the company most likely operates in a very competitive, or possibly, perfectly competitive market. I advocate that investors find those companies whose businesses generate strong gross and operating margins, because, oftentimes, these are companies that have some competitive advantage, or economic moat, such that they will generate strong free cash flow for their investors.Below, we can see that both Shopify and Square have very strong gross margins.Source: YCharts.comThat is, they generate a lot of cash from their core businesses without having to shell out a lot of cash to make that money. Further, these margins indicate that scrappy, new entrants into the POS/e-commerce space aren't successfully underpricing so as to gain market share.The most noteworthy aspect of the above chart is that, despite innumerable calls for competition destroying Square's business, they have actually grown margins. For a company that allegedly operates in an almost perfectly competitive market, it's curious that they'd have strong, growing gross margins. Further, Shopify has had calls for competition eating away at their margins also, but the data simply does not lend to that idea.Another noteworthy observation from the above gross margin chart is that Shopify's gross margin is much higher than Square's gross margin. That means that Shopify requires less money to generate their revenues, which makes sense, considering Shopify has a more online/software orientation to their business model.Now, operating margins would naturally be the next place to look for signs of profitability, but both companies presently have basically flat or negative operating margins, due to their aggressive R&D, stock-based compensation, and sales/marketing expenses. This is normal, and for growth companies, this is a very positive sign that management is committed to continuing to claim new market share and defend already held market share.At this stage in the analysis, things are about to get, shall we say, artistic. Nobody can really be sure as to what operating margins and their corresponding free cash flow will look like, not even Jack Dorsey nor Tobias Lütke. However, in the interest of determining some semblance of financial reality for both companies, I will hazard some assumptions, by which we can create our discounted cash flow models and arrive at fair, conservative valuations for both Shopify and Square.Let's start with Shopify:Source: Data from YCharts and Square's 10-Qs/10-KsIn order to arrive at the above assumptions, I took Shopify's current revenue growth rate of 44% and applied an average growth rate for the next 10 years of 35%. Next, I looked up their current gross profit margin, which has remained pretty static over the past 5 years or so. For the next two assumptions, creative license became necessary.In order to arrive at fair operating and free cash flow margins, I averaged the operating and cash flow margins (relative to revenues) of very mature companies in the software payment sector: Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). While not 1 to 1 comparisons by any means, they served their purpose.Lastly, I took the average free cash flow margin from Visa and Mastercard and applied it to Shopify's margins. As you can see above, I arrived at, in my opinion, very fair margins for a SaaS company (Shopify) that's essentially operating as a monopoly. Lastly, I assumed that FCF to Equity would grow in lockstep with revenues.Taking these assumptions, based on the data provided by Shopify's historical public financial info available to us, I created the following discounted cash flow model.Discounted Cash Flow ModelSo, get ready for the jamboree of assumptions found in the model above:I assumed that Shopify was already producing $4.78 or about $500M in free cash flow (which equates to a 34.9% free cash flow margin, which is the longer term projection). Obviously, they are not, nor are they producing cash from their core operations at present. I did this to normalize the model, as it would've been too convoluted to predict the gradual introduction of free cash flow over 5-10 years.To put the above chart into further context, paying $609.64 for Shopify today, technically, would mean we believe that Shopify will produce at least $10.8B in free cash flow by 2030. That's not $10.8B in revenue. That's $10.8B in free cash flow. This means that Shopify would need to generate $30.95B in revenue by 2030 in order to generate that amount of free cash flow.A more plausible 2030 would be one in which Shopify traded at $150B valuation with $15B in revenue and $5B in free cash flow. Such a valuation would still lend to Shopify being a buy at these levels.I certainly invite you to share your thoughts on my valuation of Shopify in the comments below. Is the company overpriced at 36x sales? Will they pull back before rocketing higher? Let me know!Next, we will assess Square using the same format as above:Source: Data from YCharts and Square's 10-Qs/10-KsAs you can see, since Square's gross margins are lower than Shopify's, their cash from operations and free cash flow margins were rated lower as well.Discounted Cash Flow ModelSource: Data from YCharts and Square's 10-Qs/10-KsIt was refreshing to do Square's discounted cash flow model, as the company has generated free cash flow for the last five years and currently has a relatively robust free cash flow per share.There really weren't any major assumptions made for Square, other than their future free cash flow growth rate. They are, in fact, still undervalued today. Eventually, the market will stop getting this one wrong, as it did with Shopify last year.The 6 River Systems acquisition really cannot be emphasized enough. Through the acquisition, Shopify has created overnight ""Fulfillment By Shopify"", which will henceforth rival ""Fulfillment By Amazon"". Fulfillment By Amazon is a segment of Amazon's business, which is reported as a portion of their ""Third Party Seller Services"" revenue segment in their 10-Qs and 10-Ks.Amazon does not detail exactly how much revenue warehousing and shipping, specifically, generates for the company. In total, ""Third Party Seller Services"" generated about $50B in 2019, and the ability to sell on their marketplace generated a portion of that. Further, it has taken Amazon decades to reach such a run-rate. So, while the 6 River Systems acquisition is noteworthy, we cannot expect it to revolutionize Shopify's financial standing overnight.One of the key, and most significant, components of Fulfillment By Shopify is that it will immediately offer merchants on the Shopify platform the ability to execute two day shipping, which will eventually become one day shipping with enough scale. This really is a game changer for Shopify and their merchants. It enables Shopify and their merchants to truly compete against Amazon in a meaningful way. That is, Amazon has studied consumers extensively and found that shipping speed is a huge component of whether they will choose to purchase from a particular online store. Hence, Amazon has become a near monopoly because of their ability to deliver expediently at a manageable cost.So, in this light, Shopify has become the ""Anti-Amazon"". I recommend all my readers to read this article regarding the new service. It represents the David Vs. Goliath narrative that has been looming over Shopify since their inception. Fulfillment by Shopify may be the rock that topples Amazon down a notch and gives Shopify and their merchants the chance to compete against Amazon's dominance.Interestingly, Square has faced the most bearish consensus as of late, yet it is the company with growing gross margins and consistent free cash flow generation over the 5 years. Further, Square was founded 5 years after Shopify. So, a company (Square) with a 5-year disadvantage and revenues 3x those of Shopify is currently being dramatically undervalued relative to their closest peer, Shopify. Mr. Market can be and is often wrong.While the narrative of 6 River Systems is incredible and will likely prove to be the turning point in Shopify's history, Shopify's share price has gotten a bit ahead of its skis. One less than perfect earnings report could send the stock tumbling. Further, if Fed Chairman Powell becomes hawkish, all bets are off for the rosy projections for Shopify and their share price.Could Shopify grow into their valuation? Of course. A 2030 where Shopify generates $15B in revenue and trades at a $150B valuation, similar to a Salesforce (CRM), is more than plausible. And under this financial projection, I'm altering my stance to bullish. However, Shopify is certainly not a conviction buy at their current valuation.In sum, the 6 River Systems acquisition has created the massive momentum we've seen in Shopify's share price as of late. The acquisition effectively eliminates any other option for online sellers looking to sell in a location other than Amazon. Shopify, or the Anti-Amazon, has truly become the only option for e-commerce first merchants, and they are being valued accordingly. Square, on the other hand, has been cast aside by Wall Street, likely due to their CEO's concerning behavior, such as wanting to move to Africa for half of 2020. Notwithstanding, Square remains a solid business that specializes in servicing an entirely different segment of the small and medium-sized business market in the U.S., and in a growing way, abroad.Once again, I am a conviction buyer of Square in the $60s and $70s, and just bullish on Shopify. When Shopify does experience some element of mean reversion, I will be a conviction buyer once again.Thanks for reading and happy investing!"
4311634,69905,2019-12-10T11:40:47-05:00,"Dissecting Square's profit margins.Rapidly expanding sector, but how much will Square carve out?Why investors should avoid this stock.","Square (SQ) is a company with strong potential. But I contend that it is significantly overpriced and that it won't make for a rewarding investment for new shareholders.Last month, I analyzed Square's growth drivers in some detail:Source: Clear Slowdown, Stock OvervaluedConsequently, rather than repeat that same theme, in this article, I'm questioning Square's potential ""path to profitability"", and the lack of upside shareholders are being offered when they pay up approximately $30 billion market cap for the company.Square has two main business units:Altogether, on an adjusted EBITDA margin, the consolidated business is guided for 19% for 2019, and Square's preliminary guidance for 2020 is pointing towards adjusted EBITDA guidance of 18%-19%.Having said that, the first aspect to acquiesce is that just over 70% of Square's trailing nine months adjusted EBITDA is made up of stock-based compensation. The bulk of the remainder of its add-backs are made up of depreciation and amortization, a figure which closely aligns with Square's capex requirements.But ultimately, the biggest cash-drag comes from the payments made for taxes on management's vested stock options. Specifically, over the past nine months, this cash use amounted to just over $164 million - more than 50% of its adjusted EBITDA.With these pesky costs, expenses and cash uses, Square's trailing nine months $298 million of adjusted EBITDA does not translate into a particularly cash generative business, now does it? (source)Square CEO Jack Dorsey is incredibly innovative, and his ''land and expand'' strategy has worked wonders with its Seller Ecosystem. Dorsey recognized an untapped opportunity in the market and went after it with substantial success.The problem, though, is that its competition has finally woken up and is already coming after it. Well funded players such as Clover (private), PayPal (PYPL), Shopify (SHOP), even Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL) are getting involved with payment solutions.To be fair, Square's Seller Ecosystem has attempted to carve out market share by being a low-priced competitor, and having educated its customer base and rapidly reached critical scale, it has already carved out some strong competitive advantages.This has been noted through Square's land-and-expand portfolio offering, where customers come onto its platform through a reference, friend or to pay an employee, but end up adopting more services, such as website builder, payroll, or to manage their finances.Altogether, this builds network effects, which will help in cross-selling products over to Square's Cash App.But the fundamental question for readers is to ask how much of these qualitative attributes are not already being priced in? And that is a much more challenging question to answer.In reality, investors don't need to know the answer to the above question. Investors simply need to recognize that Square's present valuation leaves investors with no margin of safety:Source: author's calculationsThere is little doubt that investors' appetite for high growth stocks is high. Investors appear to be willing to pay any price to participate in the rapidly expanding payment solutions sector.But I believe that investors are paying too rich a multiple for Square. As evidenced in the table, investors are paying close to 50x trailing cash flows from operations (before capex), for a company that is likely to be growing in the low 30s percent in 2020.And with its mounting competition, this will plague Square's future pricing power. Furthermore, Square's customers are not tied to long-term contracts, making switching operators relatively easy.As we progress along one of the longest bull markets in history, too many new generation investors are unquestionably believing that the path to riches comes from buying stock in rapidly growing enterprises.Naysayers, such as myself, are pushed aside. But when the economy contracts, these overvalued enterprises will rapidly reprice at much lower valuations. And only then will we know which companies offer investors a margin of safety. Personally, I believe the path to success is derived from Warren Buffett's rule number 1: don't lose money and avoid this stock."
4313591,102107,2019-12-23T07:00:00-05:00,"We look at the technology sector for our second year-end Marketplace Roundtable.The sector has been a leader even as the regulatory and valuation bullseye on it has grown, and our authors mostly expect that leadership to continue.They share a few favorite names and ideas, including big ones you expect and a few smaller ones you might not.","2019 finishes with an extra kick for investors. Part of that is the continued strong run of the market, erasing memories of last year's near bear market and extending the decade-long bull. There also are plenty of market headlines and events that have sprung over the end of the year, from Phase 1 trade deals to M&A to political whirlwinds and more.More trivially, the 2010s are ending and the 2020s begin. It's been quite a decade for equity investors, with the S&P 500 returning over 250% in that time. Even underperformance could leave a portfolio in good shape, and any alpha that was found would really leave investors well off.Where does that leave investors and the markets for 2020, at the start of a new decade? That's what we try to answer in our annual Marketplace Roundtable series. We are publishing roundtable discussions featuring more than 80 authors from across the spectrum of investing styles and focuses you find on Seeking Alpha: Macro to value investing, small cap to energy, gold to quant and alternative strategies, and more.Today's discussion focuses on the Tech sector, which was again a market leader. We're featuring the following panel:From Growth to Value: I think too much time and energy is wasted in trying to predict the market. You never know when investor sentiment will turn sour. The fact that this is ""the most hated bull market"" is rather a good thing. I see the constant bear market threat as insurance against irrational valuations.Some stocks that have outstanding results, raise guidance and fall nonetheless because the beats and the raise were already priced in. This is very healthy for the general market. It's only when there is exuberance and overreaction you might see a big fall in stocks. Some stock categories are richly valued but that is always the case in a bull market. As long as not all stocks are severely overvalued, the bull market may continue.Damon Verial: This bull market has been seen as one of momentum. Whenever that momentum is perceived to stop, such as last Q4 or back in August, you start to hear about the bull market ending. Recently, momentum is back up, and the fear mongering has ceased. However, the market doesn’t work as most people believe. Momentum typically is bullish but weakening right before a bear market – not negative. Hence investors should be fearful when they see positive but declining momentum in stocks – not after momentum turns negative.Integrator: I tend to focus more on high quality, secularly growing businesses so I'm less concerned about how the overall market performs but I will say that I expect to see a much stronger divergence in distribution of returns going forward with higher quality growth names continuing to provide stronger returns and lower quality names with limited growth prospects for revenue and earnings struggling to deliver satisfactory returns. As we likely enter into a cycle of more tepid economic growth, you will see a greater disparity between the ""haves"" and ""have nots."" Companies that can grow earnings will be rewarded and those that can't won't. I expect much lower overall returns for markets in 2020.Andres Cardenal: Many analysts tend to lose sight of the fact that the market is not driven by the fundamentals alone, but the fundamentals in comparison to expectations. When expectations are low and there is a healthy degree of fear in the market, it is relatively easy for the fundamentals to outperform those expectations and for stock prices to do well going forward. Bull markets are born on pessimism and die on euphoria, and we have not reached euphoria levels at this stage. This is indicating that the path of least resistance for the market is higher.Bull & Bear Trading: The recent momentum higher will usher us into 2020 with a fully valued market. Near term, the optimism of USMCA and China trade deals may fade as expectations are tempered by reality. A strong U.S. consumer may combine with better global growth for 3% GDP in the U.S next year. A historically strong labor market may be accompanied by further wage growth that could help move inflation toward the Fed's target of 2%. This economic strength means that a key bull market driver of decreasing interest rates may be absent in 2020.The changing interest rate environment may create less favorable conditions for the market. We anticipate 2020 to be a trading range market with a slight upside bias. Near term we are wary of a market correction.Elazar Advisors, LLC: The Fed is pumping money into the market like crazy. Buckle up. The key word being up.Julian Lin: The time to sell the market is when you can't find any stocks to buy. I am still finding many deeply undervalued stocks, and as a result I do not fear any market crash.Robert Castellano: Corporate earnings are rolling the game, but some sectors are overbought.Rick Pendergraft: The momentum is obviously still to the upside, but we all know the rally has to come to an end at some point. I am cautiously optimistic for 2020 with an eye on lowering equity allocations if certain technical events happen.Cestrian Capital Research: We believe the market will continue to rise, albeit punctuated by more spasms and sell-offs than has been the case over the last decade.Mark Hibben: I viewed the collapse of tech stocks, the focus of my service, in December 2018, as panic selling and I made clear that I thought it was a good time to buy. I added to my portfolio as stocks were going down. As I expected, the portfolio recovered, about doubling in value from the December lows and exceeding the high point of the portfolio total return in late August 2018. But that was then.Lately I've had the feeling that we're approaching the end of the bull market, either do to continuing trade tensions or recession, so I took profit and pared back the portfolio to key long term growth companies. In a market downturn, I'll be a buyer once again. In short, I regard an end to the bull market as a buying opportunity.Joe Albano: Most would agree you can't time the market. So why try predicting a massive correction, recession, or depression? Stick to your risk tolerance and goals. Keep cash at all times, and watch the charts. If things look like they're about to fall then situate yourself to hedge. I wrote an article this past month saying the Nasdaq could be in trouble before the year is out. And it could have been based. But the key was I didn't hedge or sell my portfolio. I just created a heads up for myself in case it happened. I circled the key levels and would begin hedging if it got there. If it didn't, then I hadn't changed course and I'm still fully invested (per my goals and cash allocation).EnerTuition: I generally focus on long-term wealth generation through individual stock picking and not the market. Having said that the market is very frothy which is understandable in the context of low interest rates. As a result of ZIRP/NIRP climate, there may be a correction but not a steep one as the money has to go somewhere.From Growth to Value: One of the great things about the stock market is that you never stop learning. There are many things I have learned about investing in 2019. One of the things I like the most is looking the competitive moat of a great company culture. That means how happy employees are but also customers. That can seem petty, but retaining or attracting top talent with little perks and a great company culture is really an advantage and it doesn't show up in the books.Damon Verial: One of my friends, an investment advisor, says that my ability to predict the market accurately comes from being a trader, not an investor. He says that traders, who make daily actions in the market, have their fingers on the market pulse and can predict the market more correctly than can investors. If this is true, then I believe earnings traders have the best pulse-monitoring ability of all traders, as it is earnings that move the market. I have found that monitoring my earnings trades’ directions has helped me in predicting future market movements - More short earnings trades implies a general overpricing in the market, more long trades implies too much pessimism in earnings estimations and a better chance for companies to surprise on the upside, moving markets higher.Integrator: The power of patience. The markets often give you what you want, you just have to be patient and disciplined enough to wait for it. I saw this illustrated really strongly in 2019. I happened to pick up some Facebook (FB) stock during the throes of the late December 2018 panic that saw this name heavily sold off. 2019 saw a return to business as usual and the name rebounded 50%. Similarly, I have had my eye on high growth SaaS business like The Trade Desk (TTD) and Avalara (AVLR) for sometime, but couldn't get my arms around the valuation. Opportunity struck in late 2019. You need to be patient to wait for quality on sale, and if you stick with high quality names long enough and can maintain patience in the face of turmoil, the market eventually rewards you.Andres Cardenal: I reaffirmed a key concept - do not fight the Fed. I was heavily hedged and even net short during the fourth quarter of 2018, mostly because the Fed was mistakenly rising rates and the economic data overseas was looking quite ugly. But then monetary policy started to pivot and markets were oversold, so we turned long in January of 2019. Even if there have been plenty of reasons for concern on the economic and political front during the year, being on the right side of liquidity trends has proven to be of utmost importance once again.Bull & Bear Trading: China's communists have learned to weaponize capitalism and have been waging economic hybrid warfare against the west for decades. Chinese state-sponsored, corporate espionage is an enormous economic threat that is growing rapidly. This trade war was launched by the Chinese against the U.S. decades ago and we are very late in responding. This trade war is very likely to escalate despite the headlines of a Phase I deal. Many Chinese companies listed on both U.S. and Chinese exchanges are not using anything close to accepted accounting practices and some companies are outright fraudulent. China's national debt is a house of cards that is unsustainable. Alarmingly, China has now begun to export its bad debt by the billions on world credit markets. Why would anyone ever believe that communists who refuse to provide transparency of their accounting would be responsible capitalists? These two differing ideologies are incompatible with starkly irreconcilable differences. A dragon cannot also be a lamb any more than a communist can also be a capitalist. The west is allowing the capitalist foundation of the global economy to be destroyed by communist China's refusal to allow transparency into their accounting at all levels. Decades of bad Chinese debt are now unsustainable so they are being exported to the west via world credit markets and the IMF, which may have become corrupted by China. Western capitalists believed that introducing capitalism into communist China would provide a more attractive ideology that all Chinese would embrace. Instead, this effort has gone very wrong with China's communists weaponizing capitalism as a means to increase their power, build a world-class military, become integral to the world's supply chain, and weaken the financial structures of global capitalism. Capitalists have created a communist economic monster that now threatens to destroy its creators.Elazar Advisors, LLC: This economy is incredibly resilient. It held up given this ridiculously annoying trade war. If this trade deal sticks I have to believe the economy can actually improve.Julian Lin: The public has a seemingly universal hate for share buybacks, but the hate confuses me. This year confirmed my belief that share buybacks are an efficient catalyst to take advantage of an underperforming stock price. We saw this with Facebook, which rebounded over 50% from its lows as it directed all of its free cash flow to buying back shares at 16-18 times trailing earnings. Identifying companies trading at a discount with a large share buyback program is a highly underrated investment strategy.Robert Castellano: A correlation of revenues and stock prices doesn't exist in 2019 nor 2018 in tech.Rick Pendergraft: I came in to 2019 expecting the market to rally in the first quarter and then hit some resistance at the long-term moving averages. The resistance never really materialized and I learned to trade what I was seeing, not what I was thinking.Cestrian Capital Research: That nothing matters!Mark Hibben: The big lesson I learned was not to adhere rigidly to the buy and hold philosophy. Not all companies can be the next Apple (AAPL). Some companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) and IPG Photonics (IPGP) became so overheated in value by mid-summer in 2018 that it would have been worthwhile to sell. The indicator for me was that the share value was far above (like 100% above) my calculated DCF fair value. Nvidia has recovered somewhat since then, and IPGP continued to decline. Neither company returned to their high valuations of 2018. I missed an opportunity to take profit in these companies. I still hold Nvidia, however, since I believe that it does represent a strong long-term growth prospect at its current valuation.Joe Albano: To stick to the data and act on your data. Sometimes it takes longer for a thesis to play out. If your goals and time horizon are long term, don't fuss about the short term. Everyone wants instant gratification but the mature investor knows if the story hasn't changed the market will come to grips with the story.EnerTuition: The ongoing lesson of the booming market is that shorting high valuation is not a great idea and even shorting junk may not be a good idea.From Growth to Value: Tech is the engine of change so, over the long term, it will do great. Some tech stocks have high valuations and a lot of growth baked in. But because of that, some investors shy away from the whole tech sector, which can create opportunities for long-term investors.I think it's always best to scale into tech stocks, as some are very volatile. Because of their often very high gross margins, tech stocks will be rewarding patient long-term investors.Sometimes stocks that need time to grow into their valuation. A great example is Square (SQ) that has not revisited its high of mid-2018. Because some very vocal investors look too much at the stock price as an indication for the underlying business, there have been a lot of negative comments about Square. That gives long-term investors a chance to scale into the stock.Damon Verial: Tech stocks have been taking three steps forward and one step back: For every three good months, expect one correction the next. In the short term, we have several warning signs pointing to a pullback in tech. Recently, I issued warnings for both Apple and Oracle (ORCL), the latter of which we aim to play over earnings. In the medium term, too, the risk/reward is not in favor of the bulls, as many companies are becoming unsustainably overpriced. In the long term, the momentum in tech should continue to hold as companies improve their products/services, the fruits of which will be seen in stronger earnings reports, thereby helping justify the increasingly high prices.Integrator: Tech is home to many long-term secular growth stories including the shift to SaaS (Software as a Service), digital advertising, digital payments and digital commerce. These themes have been playing out over the last few years, but what's less appreciated is that they still have many years to play out. That means more years of strong earnings and cash flows for businesses that have competitive positions in these spaces. I think the SaaS correction that we saw toward the end of 2019 was good for the sector. I see many of the SaaS names having a strong 2020, when investors realize just how disruptive this space will be for a long period of time.Andres Cardenal: Valuations are getting extended in technology, so investors need to be more selective in terms of stock picking in the sector going forward. Short-term pullbacks are perfectly normal and should even be expected. However, over the long term the technology sector is creating enormous amounts of value and innovation, so investors in technology stocks will probably benefit from superior returns over time.Bull & Bear Trading: The character named Old Turkey in Jesse Livermore's classic novel Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"" would remind you that, ""It's a bull market, you know."" However, we might like to inquire of Mr. Old Turkey how he feels about very mature bull markets that have the Fed punch bowl of decreasing interest rates taken away at the end of the party? Generally, the scenario of the Fed reaching the end of an interest rate reduction cycle can signal caution in the markets. We believe caution is exactly the correct posture to adopt at this time. Bullish sentiments may be tempered with caution now to protect recent gains. We expect 2020 to be a trading range market where stock pickers excel. The optimistic expectations for the China trade deal may disappoint by the realities of communist China's incalcitrant focus upon its own global ambitions. A strong labor market and economy is likely to combine for the Fed's 2% target on inflation being met. The discussion may evolve to rising interest rates.Elazar Advisors, LLC: We're looking for stocks with 45% upside potential. I think there's always those opportunities in every market, if you do the work. Fundamentals held up nicely in the face of a trade war. Pull that trade war aside for election year and it's easy to see how things can actually get better. Plus the Fed printing and pumping can't hurt.Julian Lin: Everyone - everyone - is saying that tech is in a bubble. While I agree that many firms have traded at lofty valuations at some point in 2019, I however believe that the general skepticism shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the software business model. I have written many times that the lack of profits at tech companies is more of an accounting than fundamental issue - over time, the inherent operating leverage from the software as a subscription ('SAAS') model should generate substantial operating margins. The key, of course, is correctly projecting one's ability to capture market share and the overall size of the market. The big winners in the stock market have been tech companies over the past 10 years, and I expect that to continue over the next 10 years.Rick Pendergraft: I think you have to handle it on a company-by-company basis. I try to start with companies with solid fundamentals and then try to time the entry with sentiment and technical analysis. There are certainly some companies where I think investors should be defensive and I have taken profits on some. I think software is primed to pace the gains within the tech sector in 2020 after semiconductors outpaced the sector in 2019.Cestrian Capital Research: We anticipate continued growth in the sector. Why not? The economy is strong and we are only midway through a tectonic platform shift in tech, from on-premises to cloud. That means plenty of enterprise spending still to come.Mark Hibben: I have been getting more defensive, in the sense that when there was an opportunity to take a substantial profit in a company, I went ahead and sold. If I had thought that the near term (next couple of years) offered better prospects, I might have just held.In many cases, I missed out on some profit. I sold Qualcomm (QCOM), Teradyne (TER), Lumentum (LITE), ASML Holding (ASML), and TSMC (TSM) this year. These companies subsequently rose above my selling price on trade optimism. In most cases, I realized substantial (40% or more) returns, so I'm not too concerned.Generally, these companies were trading well above fair value, as far as I was concerned, so they had become problematic to justify as holds in any case. My perception was that we're very near a high point in the tech sector, so that added to the imperative to sell. But overall, I think tech is a great sector to invest in during a downturn, and some of the companies I sold this year I expect to buy back into.Joe Albano: It's just getting started. Semiconductors are a large part of the sector and they only have just come alive at the end of 2019. Some have hit new 52-week highs while others are still working their way there. Don't discount data center giants like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), or Facebook either though, they are coming up on refreshes of hardware and infrastructure weighted toward the latter half of the year so it may take a few months to get rolling, but I see the momentum starting and the train gaining steam now.EnerTuition: Tech has seen a huge bull run and it is difficult to find good values unless one looks at the market with the lens of ZIRP/NIRP expansion. We are not fans of low growth companies in that context.From Growth to Value: I don't follow semiconductors closely, because I think it is more or less a commoditized sector and it is very dependent on outside factors, especially the trade war and its consequences. A prime example is the Chinese announcement that all foreign PC hardware and operating systems must be removed from all state offices in the next three years.Integrator: Largely macro, but I also feel there is a secular element to this as well. The semi's power all manner of embedded systems for connected devices, and with internet of things (IoT) still in the really early stages of a long term uptrend, I think there's some thought there could be a real structural shift underlying some of this movement and its not merely just cyclical any more. Time will tell.Andres Cardenal: One of the main positive factors is that semiconductors have already been through a slowdown in demand, and many of the companies in the sector delivered superior performance than what the market was expecting. Long-term demand for semiconductors is increasing due to technological trends, and cyclicality risk is proven to be more moderate than it was in the past.Elazar Advisors, LLC: Memory prices like NAND have turned up. DRAM is bottoming. 5G and the trade war behind us can keep the party going.Julian Lin: Commentary from semiconductor management teams has indicated that the cyclical downturn is trade-war related. No one, however, can judge the extent of the downturn. I am positioned only in semiconductor companies with strong balance sheets and ample free cash flow - Texas Instruments (TXN) is a conservative pick in the sector with an A-rated balance sheet, growing dividend, and strong share repurchase program.Robert Castellano: The semi drawdowns this year are largely company dependent depending on exposure to the China trade/technology war. But it is also impacted by micro factors such as delays in Intel (INTC) chip shipments or large inventory of memory chips at Micron (MU).Rick Pendergraft: The downswings from semis were mostly tied to the trade war as so many stocks in the industry are heavily dependent on trade with China. Now that we have the first phase of the trade agreement, we shouldn't see as many wild swings from the chip sector in 2020.Cestrian Capital Research: We believe semis will move up, but remain volatile and are challenging long-term holds, if only for the psychological damage the stocks can inflict. Trading semis can offer rich rewards, however. Trade isn't a real thing. It's just a game. It will wash out in the end.Mark Hibben: I viewed the semiconductor selloffs as trade related. Any time the Chinese market for semiconductors seemed threatened by the state of the trade negotiations, semis tended to sell off. Although my portfolio has been heavily into semis, I've avoided the more cyclical semis such as memory and storage. Instead, I've focused on what I call “new paradigm” semiconductor companies that combine extensive software and hardware into integrated products. Apple is the archetypical new paradigm company. Many of the companies I held fed into the new paradigm such as Lumentum, ASML, and TSMC.The new paradigm is not cyclical in the way memory is (or can be) but it was just as sensitive to trade concerns, especially Apple, given the importance of China to Apple, and the way that Apple's China business declined starting in the December quarter of 2018.Joe Albano: Macro is only part of it. Macro was the cloud over the recovery for semiconductors. It was an added weight on the squat bar as semis tried to stand up again as OEMs digested their inventories. The cycle is now at the bottom, as seen by the upturn in NAND spot and contract pricing and the stabilized DRAM contract pricing and upturn in DRAM spot pricing. The cycles have gotten more shallow, and each wave will be higher than the last. I see more discipline by OEMs and producers on this side of the cycle, so it may be more drawn out and more stable as things move up - which is good for reducing volatility and increasing visibility.EnerTuition: As far as the whole sector is concerned, we are still at the bottom of the cycle in terms of prospects. The valuations already discount strong up tick in the sector and healthy growth for individual companies. Outside of select segments, it is not clear that the view is justified. We see signs of growth but no signs of strong widespread uptick in 2020.From Growth to Value: The fact that Uber, Lyft and WeWork fell from their pedestals is very healthy for the markets. It separates companies that are profitable or have a path to profitability from the windmakers that just trade on sentiment. These companies put on a tech cloak but they are really just in commodity businesses, where pricing power is close to zero: taxis and real estate. The fact that investors saw through the fog these companies created, makes me feel optimistic about the market as a good judge between substance and talk.Damon Verial: Right now, tech stocks show a huge split in winners/losers. The upward momentum in the Nasdaq is mostly due to the winners outpacing the losers. As for unicorns, tech IPOs usually underperform. For long positions, stick with older companies that are producing new tech instead of hopping on the bandwagon with whatever is trendy at the moment. For example, I’ve been shorting the newly listed Slack (WORK), personally, as I do not believe it will outcompete the better-funded, more-experienced Microsoft (MSFT), with its equivalent, Teams.Integrator: I really focus on technology businesses with strong competitive advantages that are profitable, or have a path to profitability, so this is less relevant to me. I don't know if this has major impacts on the sector over all, but what it will do is make investors more discerning. Quality will continue to do well, and speculative business models will get punished. A flow on effect may be to pull down valuations of some of the earlier stage tech businesses coming to market. You are already seeing a retracement in valuations in the unlisted, venture capital space. Really high-quality tech with strong earnings and reasonable valuations will continue to do well.Andres Cardenal: I think investors are smart enough to differentiate between companies with solid fundamentals versus the over-hyped IPOs, so this is not much of a risk for the strong companies in the technology sector. But I still watch the more speculative stocks in the sector only to assess risk appetite levels and to monitor bubble risk.Elazar Advisors, LLC: I was around in the dot.com bubble. I'm earnings focused so I just ignore these distractions until I have some inkling of EPS. Ultimately a stock without earnings is a hot potato.Julian Lin: Poor IPO performance, ironically, indicates a sense of rationality in the markets. At this point, however, investors may actually wish to ask - is the IPO bloodbath overdone? Are there any buying opportunities in the former bubble party?Rick Pendergraft: I think it has a minor reflection on the industry, but almost everything I write about or recommend has been around for a number of years. The analysis tools that I prefer to use aren't really suitable to stocks that haven't been around for at least a few years.Cestrian Capital Research: The collapse of unicorn hubris is a wonderful thing for investors. It will lead to more appealing IPO valuations and more sustainable value growth post-IPO. Less catastrophic but no less meaningful that the dot com collapse. Unicorns were borne of Internet 2.0. They will pass more quietly than the casualties of Internet 1.0 but will be no more mourned.Mark Hibben: I've had no interest or holdings in these types of companies. They don't matter to my portfolio at all. These companies are grossly overvalued, in my opinion.Joe Albano: I see Uber and Lyft as having other issues coming to IPO. Other than any already bloated valuation, there were headwinds with legislation and classification of drivers. It was just a not so great time to have IPO'd with those things on the radar. For the overall tech sector, it's not impactful. For every Lyft there was a Zoom. We just hear about the ""big ones"" and the rest are forgotten or never publicized extensively. The ones with good leadership and a solid product are the ones I follow closely. Zoom is an example of that as it has come down from the IPO high (pun intended). There's going to be winners in the group of the IPOs, research and patience will lead you to the right investment with them.EnerTuition: We have advocated a short in Uber and Lyft with 70% to 80% valuation correction. Most of this has played out in 2019. Given the massive overvaluations, we see correction continuing in 2020 but likely less so given the ZIRP/NIRP dynamics.From Growth to Value: There are several aspects of regulation that make me enthusiastic as an investor. First, I think that the big tech companies are even worth more if they would be split up. The sum of the parts at Amazon (AMZN) or Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is bigger than the total. If there is a restraint on advertising power, The Trade Desk (TTD), one of the Potential Multibaggers, might benefit a lot, because it is the biggest player outside of the walled garden players like Facebook (FB) and Google.Damon Verial: Ignore the news. Focus on the products. Focus on earnings. For example, Facebook is not going to hurt in the long-run from any government pressure on what ads the company can run. Digital marketing is a rapidly growing field, and any rapidly growing field will be the talking point for politicians, who are usually just speaking for the sake of holding onto their own positions. Every company with online presence wants to advertise with Facebook, and, like with YouTube’s changes to its advertisement policies over the years, policy changes to Facebook won’t dent demand for such services.Integrator: I have some meaningful interest in large tech such as Facebook, Amazon and Google, so I'm watching developments closely. Forced divestment of acquired properties would be the most concerning to me, particularly with Facebook and Google, and would undermine their ability to provide the broad user cohort for advertisers at scale that makes them valuable franchises. I don't think this is a realistic outcome though. More likely is a more extensive disclosure regime with opt in/out notices for consumers. I don't see this having meaningful impacts on as users have generally become immune to this. Also likely is a wave of political FTC/DOJ investigations, requiring settlement, which are more a distraction rather than meaningful threat.Andres Cardenal: Chances are that the stock market is overreacting to regulatory risk. The big tech players will need to provide more guarantees in terms of data protection and antitrust compliance, but this will not impair their ability to continue producing growing sales and cash flows for shareholders. If economic history is any valid guide, regulatory uncertainty could be a source of opportunity as much as a risk factor for the sector.Elazar Advisors, LLC: You're right. This is going to be an annoyance for Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and maybe Apple. It can probably help these stocks underperform. Big government can't be good for free trade and capital returns.Julian Lin: Regulation is inevitable, but Wall Street has overestimated the potential effects on fundamentals. Facebook is trading around 24 times trailing earnings with a net cash balance sheet and 25% revenue growth. If FB was trading 50% higher then its fundamentals would still support such a stock price - the fact that shares have traded at a deeply discounted valuation for several years indicates very clearly the negative sentiment seen at mega-cap tech names. In the meantime, mega-cap tech firms continue to buy back shares at a voracious pace.Rick Pendergraft: This is certainly a talking point on the campaign trail, especially with Democratic candidates, and I do think investors need to keep an eye on certain companies. Obviously companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google are big targets and some politicians would love to make a name for themselves for helping take the monopolies down. I can definitely see more regulation toward big tech going forward, but I don't think there is enough support for major changes. One thing that could impact such regulation is whether we continue to see the strong numbers in the labor market. If the jobs numbers start to fall at all, heavier regulations on major job providers will lose their appeal very quickly.Cestrian Capital Research: We assume Amazon will be at risk, Google less so, Facebook not so much and Microsoft not at all.Mark Hibben: Much of the regulatory attention has been focused on social media companies such as Facebook (FB) for a variety of reasons. Social media appears to be easily manipulated by various malefactors spouting fake news. There are issues of competition and how the media platforms govern access. With companies like Apple, there's always going to be concern about competition, just because the company is so big. Apple has shown that it can be stupid about competition as in the e-book price fixing case. Now the main issue before Apple is the way it regulates the iOS app store and the percentage it takes from App sales (30%). Apple will probably face some regulatory push back on the app store and could see itself forced to open up iOS to apps delivered from outside the store. This would amount to legitimizing “jail breaking.” I think Apple will be able to weather whatever happens by way of regulation.Joe Albano: If anyone expects Congress to do anything other than grandstanding and smacking CEOs around, they haven't been watching C-SPAN. Now, if they were to get serious about it, exactly how would the incumbents be hurt? The only way is through telling them and forcing them not to do things with their products. Take the supposed FTC injunction reported to come against Facebook. Meddling first hand in a company's business would be the only way. But I doubt it passes judiciary muster. The market sunk FB stock on that news but has since recovered above where it was prior. Facebook has continued to bring in cash in increasing amounts throughout all of this grandstanding. This issue only slows it down temporarily but doesn't stop the cash machine. Just remember it's about image, not about justice. Equifax (EFX) still exists today.EnerTuition: This is not a threat that we play special attention to. However, of the names that we watch, Uber and Lyft have significantly more regulatory risk than others.From Growth to Value: The integration of tech and health is only starting but will probably be more talked about next year. There are a few interesting companies that try to be the first in their markets and also big tech is moving more and more into health. Apple has the lead in big tech now but if Alphabet integrates Fitbit (FIT) fluently into its ecosystem, it could catch up very quickly.Damon Verial: I don’t think Apple suing NuVia’s CEO will be a mere blip on the radar. I believe Apple will be switching to ARM-based chips for its higher-end laptops and desktops quite soon – which itself should be big news in 2020 – and the timing for the lawsuit coincides with NuVia hiring Jon Masters, the main architect for ARM for Red Hat/International Business Machines (IBM). With Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) both putting ARM development on the backburner, it would be quite a market shake-up for NuVia to go public and pose a public threat to Intel (INTC). We could also see a large movement in Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBY), which is the designer of the ARM architecture.Integrator: The role of the Internet of Things in driving digital intelligence and predictive analytics which will power a wave of digital transformation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is certainly hitting hype cycle levels, but IoT's role in powering the wave of data that makes AI really impactful is very underappreciated, because enterprises are still figuring out what IoT means to them and how to deploy it. I think 2020 is the year where this becomes a more prevalent area of focus, and the businesses that are leveraged to this start to become noticed.Andres Cardenal: Artificial intelligence in combination with big data. We are still in the initial stages of this major game changer, and we are not even imagining the possibilities that this technological revolution will produce over the long term. Investing in companies with top AI capabilities and access to strategic and financial resources can produce outstanding gains over the long term. Alphabet is a top name in this area.Elazar Advisors, LLC: Let's talk about Splunk (SPLK) and the data boom. This is a wow story for me. Revenue growth is accelerating. Cash flow is going to triple in three years. Oh and they have EPS which I love. What's crazy about this story is that recurring revenue growth is running 50% vs. their reported revenues running 30%. There's not much reason why their overall growth rate doesn't accelerate those extra 2000 basis points. That doesn't make you giggle? It did me. I like a stock when it makes me giggle.Julian Lin: It's unfortunate, but I think the narrative in tech will remain very similar to now - people will still complain about ""egregious"" price to sales multiples and a lack of profits. It may take a generational shift of investment thinking to change such a narrative.Robert Castellano: 5GRick Pendergraft: I go back to the software industry. My investment theory has always been that the fundamentals tell us what to buy and then the sentiment and technical analysis tell us when to buy it. Right now there a number of software stocks with really strong fundamentals and now it is just a matter of trying to time the entries. Instead of lagging the tech sector, like it did in 2019, I see software leading the tech sector in 2020.Cestrian Capital Research: The Trade Desk. It's a stock which is a favorite of tech folk like ourselves, but still relatively unknown amongst normal people - despite being an $11bn EV stock.Mark Hibben: Probably the arrival of Apple's augmented reality glasses, or “smart glasses.” These will be fairly inconspicuous and resemble normal sun glasses. These will be tethered wirelessly to iPhone and provide an ultra high definition display for iPhone as well as for augmented reality content that is superimposed on the real world. The glasses will also provide a way to control iPhone using voice and hand gestures. Smart glasses will be a boost to the wearables segment for Apple, but sell in small quantities initially do to their high price. Numerous pundits will criticize them as over-priced, non-essential toys.EnerTuition: AMDFrom Growth to Value: As a long-term investor, I think that most of my Potential Multibagger stocks are still great picks, but especially The Trade Desk and Square. They are both in industries at the start of a big secular trend and they are sometimes misunderstood. For Square, investors don't realize the huge potential of Cash App yet. It's only three years old, but it is already the biggest contributor to Square's revenue, bigger than the legacy point -of -sale technology. For The Trade Desk, investors don't understand enough that CTV and audio (podcast) commercials are still in their infancy and both grow by triple digits YoY.Damon Verial: With stocks nearing all-time highs, many have asked me whether to ditch stocks for bonds in 2020. The current state of the market shows that the probability favors the bulls, while the risk-reward favors the bears. In this regard, if you’re looking for both safety and income, the dividends offered in many industries, such as consumer discretionary, outperform the expected gains from bonds. Look for low-volatility, mid-cap stocks with solid dividend histories. Take a look at the ProShares S&P Midcap 400 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (REGL) or Vanguard Consumer Discretionary Index Fund ETF (VCR) for suitable alternatives to bonds.Integrator: Mastercard (MA). I've held this name for quite a long time, but the story and prospects just keep getting better. The part of the story that is known is that this business is a powerful cash generator with exceptional barriers to entry and strong returns on invested capital that is chasing the 85% of the consumer payments expenditure market that is still dominated by cash or cheque. That's a powerful secular growth story right there.What isn't as well appreciated is that the business will be a dominant player in B2B payments in 2-3 years time, through leveraging existing assets and relationships, with an addressable market that is 2-3x the size of its current core consumer payments market. Given the dynamics of this market, I see Mastercard and Visa sharing the spoils in this space over the long haul.I like to buy and hold and compound my capital over a decade long time frame or more, so I don't just see this as just a play for 2020, but one that can be held for a multi year time frame. I expect 2020 will see the company make more significant inroads into the space and that the stock will be rewarded accordingly.Andres Cardenal: The Trade Desk. The company is a market leader in programmatic advertising and it’s benefiting from massive opportunities due to the connected TV revolution and growing demand for online music and podcasting in the years ahead.Customer retention rates are above 95%, and revenue increased 38% last quarter. The company is aggressively investing for growth, but it's already producing positive earnings and cash flows.The Trade Desk has built key alliances with leading players like Amazon (AMZN) and Disney (DIS), so the company is strategically positioned to capitalize on exponential growth opportunities in 2020 and beyond.Bull & Bear Trading: We are proud of our 8-for-8 published and documented track record of trading calls on Snap, Inc. (SNAP). We were long the momentum on Snap's IPO day in March 2017. We sold short at $28 on day 3 after the IPO. And we covered our short and went long in January 2019 at $5 per share, pretty much nailing the inflection point at the bottom of the chart.We covered our short and went long Snap when sentiment was extremely negative, a good indicator of an oversold stock. During interaction in the comments section of a Seeking Alpha article on Snap, another SA contributor guided us to a very significant item of research. It was a brief Digiday article (yeah, rather obscure but that's the point here!) discussing Snap's low-end marketplace strategy just beginning to show first signs of gaining traction. In this case it was another SA contributor that deserves the credit for uncovering this golden research who contributes to SA as True North Alger. We covered our short and established a long position.This social media alternative to Facebook has successfully implemented a low-end of market strategy that has increased their market share among advertisers. 2020 may see the company begin to expand their margins and revenues by increasing prices and gaining a larger portion of ad-spend budgets. Facebook's current challenges are well documented and the threat of anti-trust regulation against tech giants has given Snap an opportunity. Newer, more experienced management has been rescuing Snap's business model methodically for the last 18 months. 2020 may be the time for Snap to begin trading at a premium in this bull market as the company's turnaround justifies the positive sentiment that has been replacing the overly bearish sentiment of the past. Snap has transitioned from the company that Wall Street loved to hate into what may become one of the best turnaround stories in social media since Twitter's (TWTR) financial engineering to boost its own stock price. However, Snap's turnaround may prove to be more legitimately based upon actual revenue growth and the taking of market share in social media than Twitter's turnaround. This revenue growth by Snap in a growth industry is the stuff that often rewards stocks with a very aggressive premium. We anticipate all-time new highs above the $29 per share mark in 2020 for this stock currently trading at about $15.00.Elazar Advisors, LLC: Tesla (TSLA). Way too many bears and volumes and margins are about to launch.Julian Lin: Simon Property Group (SPG) is my repeat favorite idea for 2020. SPG is a real estate landlord of high quality ""Class A"" mall properties. The stock has returned -40% since 2016 vs. +40% for the S&P 500. The fundamentals however remain strong, with the company guiding for 2% comparable cash flow growth in spite of numerous retail bankruptcies. High quality malls have had no trouble finding replacement tenants for store closures, but the high concentration of store closures has made the struggles appear secular rather than cyclical. SPG has a strong balance sheet with an A-credit rating and capacity to take on more leverage. SPG pays a 5.8% dividend and is generating enough free cash flow to fund the dividend, $1 billion to $1.5 billion in anchor redevelopment projects, and buy back stock. There is blood in the streets of malls, and SPG is best of breed.Rick Pendergraft: Looking at the list of stocks that currently meet my fundamental requirements, the two sectors that are most represented are tech and financials. Within those sectors, the software industry in particular is heavily represented so I can see software being attractive this year. In the financial sector, banks are well represented on my list of stocks to watch.Cestrian Capital Research: US space and defense stocks, particularly Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). Defense spending is rising and the newly-real Space Force will bring with it the arming of space. NOC and LMT are best placed to take advantage of that trend in our view. A more volatile but equally profit-capable stock riding the same wave is Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD).Mark Hibben: The recession of 2008 and the recovery of the tech sector this past year show how durable technology companies can be in the face of an economic downturn. This is the sector to buy into during the downturn to come. It's important to be selective and focus on quality companies with real technical advantages and good bottom lines. The story for the next few years will be what companies survive and prosper during the downturn compared to what companies do not. I will tend to avoid companies that have racked up large losses during the good times. Uber comes to mind.I think the “platform” companies will ride out any recession just fine. These include Apple, Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia. These companies combine hardware and software into integrated products, and have extended hardware development to the silicon level.Joe Albano: Anything semiconductor. With trade headwinds easing and inventories in the OEM supply chain normalized after a huge build up, 2020 will be setting itself up for anything with a bit or a byte in it. Nvidia, Western Digital (WDC), Micron (MU), Skyworks (SEKS), and Broadcom (AVGO). Each have their own strengths and story in the market so it depends how risky you want to get or how aggressive you want to get. I own them all, and I see large gains in 2020 and already have as 2019 comes to an end.EnerTuition: Advanced Micro Devices continues to be the top idea for 2020 in spite of being one of the best stocks in the market and Beyond The Hype subscribers in 2018 and 2019. While some view the stock as played out with a big run, we do not see slow down in market share gains against Intel (INTC) and, if fact, expect market share gains to accelerate in 2020.***Thanks to our panelists for participating!

4313783,99986,2019-12-23T04:02:52-05:00,"Square continues to massively underperform the Mobile Payments Group, with a 13% year-to-date return versus the group's 40% return.While the company continues to see double-digit earnings growth, I continue to see the stock as relatively expensive versus its peers.Fund ownership in Square continues to decline, a change in character from when dips were being bought the past two years.I continue to see the stock as an Avoid in the group, and would view any rallies towards the $75.00-80.00 level as selling opportunities.","While the Mobile Payments ETF (IPAY) has enjoyed a massive year and has outperformed the S&P 500 (SPY), Square (SQ) has been one of the clear laggards in the group. The stock has seen a mere 13% return year to date, paling in comparison to the Mobile Payment ETF's 40% return. Despite lagging the index and consolidating all year, the company remains expensive compared to its peers. This is not helped by the fact that the growth story has some uncertainty after Square noted it is abandoning its adjusted revenue metric after SEC Letter comments. Worse, funds are less eager to buy the dip than they've been in the past, with the first material drop in fund ownership in the past three years. I continue to see Square as an Avoid in the group given its relative overvaluation.(Source: TC2000.com)While several IPAY constituents have had impressive runs this year, like StoneCo (STNE) and PayPal (PYPL), Square continues to remain the ugly duckling with a mere double-digit return. While this is still a respectable performance given the stock's 60% return the prior year, I am less inclined to believe we'll be seeing another annual return like this anytime soon. Despite the stock correcting more than 30% from its 2018 highs, Square is still trading at nearly double the forward P/E ratio of its industry group. While a premium would be justified if the stock was a growth powerhouse compared to its peers, this is not the case. Let's take a closer look at the company's earnings growth below.As we can see from the below chart, Square's annual earnings per share have been in a steady uptrend since FY-2016, after finally flipping to profitable that year. In the past three years, the company has managed to grow annual EPS from $0.04 in FY-2016 to estimates for $0.78 in FY-2019, an incredible growth rate. For FY-2019 alone, the company's annual EPS is expected to grow by 66%. While this is extremely impressive, the market is no longer interested in FY-2019 growth as we close out the year in just a week. Instead, it is focused on FY-2020 and FY-2021 growth, and this is where we're beginning to see some deceleration. (Source: YCharts, Author's Chart)Current estimates for FY-2020 annual EPS are sitting at $0.95, with annual EPS estimates for FY-2021 at $1.31. While these figures represent 22% and 38% growth, respectively, these figures are substantially less robust than the growth the company enjoyed in FY-2018 (74%) and FY-2019 estimates (66%). This earnings slowdown is not ideal, as we don't have any real acceleration in revenue growth to kickstart the prior high-growth phase for Square. Instead, we have revenue growth rate averaging 44% over the past few quarters, down 500 basis points from the 49% quarterly revenue growth rate in FY-2018. Based on relatively flat revenue growth, I believe it will be more difficult for the company to trounce earnings estimates with ease as it did in the past. Therefore, I see the current earnings estimates as realistic and not overly conservative.So, what's wrong with a 22% annual EPS growth rate for FY-2020 with a stable revenue growth rate in the high 30% to low 40% range? Nothing at all; most companies would kill for growth rates like this. The issue with Square, however, is that it's valued at a growth rate substantially above its peer group despite an earnings growth rate in line with its peer group. This was not the case in FY-2019, with Square's 66% EPS growth rate soaring well above its peer's growth rates. This will come to a screeching halt in FY-2020, though, if the company can't beat estimates for $0.95 in EPS.(Source: Author's Chart)As we can see in the above chart I've built, Square's growth rate is the 2nd highest among its peer group, with StoneCo being the growth leader. These FY-2020 annual EPS growth rates are based on current estimates as of Friday's close, and I've generally found estimates to be quite accurate on $10 billion-plus market capitalization companies. The median annual EPS growth rate for the group is 19%, and Square is projected to grow annual EPS 22% next year. Therefore, Square is only a smidgen above the average growth rate for the peer group. Based on this, one could argue that Square deserves a slight premium versus Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), and PayPal (PYPL) with marginally lower growth rates. However, Square's valuation sits at double their earnings multiples. Either Square's annual EPS estimates are far too conservative at $0.95, and it's going to smash these estimates, or this premium valuation is not justified at all. (Source: YCharts)As the above chart of forward P/E ratios for the group shows, the group median forward earnings multiple is 37.21x, while the group average is 47.99x. Square is currently trading at 81.67x, which is double the median and 70% above the group average. In addition, StoneCo, which expects to grow annual EPS at nearly double Square's growth rate for FY-2020 (43% vs. 22%), is trading at only 53.6x. This is quite a large discrepancy, and I believe that this valuation disconnect is what has weighed on Square. This chart suggests that despite Square's 30% drop from its highs, it remains overvalued. While funds may be seeing something different to dictate their positioning, they certainly have not warmed up to the stock on this dip. In fact, we saw the first material quarterly drop in fund ownership in Q3.(Source: Investors.com, Author's Chart)If we take a look at the chart below, we can see that fund ownership in Square has been trending higher for over two years, but we saw the first drop last quarter. Fund ownership dropped from its highs of 1160 funds down to 1100, or roughly a 4% drop, but this was during a quarter when the share price pulled back significantly. This is a significant change of character from what we saw in Q4 2017 and Q4 2018, when Square underwent sharp correction in its share price. During these two periods, fund ownership jumped by 13% and 8% sequentially, which showed that funds were buying into weakness. The fact that this recent correction was met with selling suggests that either funds didn't care to add the stock into weakness or that they were taking advantage of strength to ring the register. The Q4 filings will be important to watch, as they will help to clarify if the Q3 2019 drop was an anomaly. Regardless, we've seen a minor change of character with funds no longer buying the dip as they did previously.(Source: TC2000.com)As the above weekly chart shows, Square is stuck in a broad range but continues to make lower highs. This is not impressive in the slightest, given the fact that the Mobile Payments group has been making higher highs all year. In addition, the stock is having a tougher time holding on to its 40-week moving average (brown line), which used to be supported from 2016 through 2018. From a relative strength standpoint, it's also made little sense to hold the stock or to expect this trend to change overnight. If we look at the below chart of Square compared to the Mobile Payments group, we can see that this ratio continues to trend lower, suggesting that Square is significantly underperforming. Therefore, if one wants exposure to the sector, it would make sense to hold the payment juggernauts Visa and Mastercard or the Mobile Payments ETF itself.(Source: StockCharts.com) Based on the fact that Square is expensive compared to its peers and funds are no longer as eager to support the stock, I see the stock as a Sell into further strength. While a rally back to the $75.00-80.00 level is possible next year, I would view this as a profit-taking opportunity. The only way I see Square reverting to leading its industry group is if it can put up annual EPS of $1.05 or higher for FY-2020. Given the flat-to-down revenue growth rate over the past year, beating estimates will be more difficult without sales surprises in the company's back pocket. For those looking for exposure to the Mobile Payments group, the group itself continues to seem like the better option versus Square."
4307528,71685,2019-11-18T14:09:13-05:00,Square is breaking out of a trading range.There has been some bullish options betting in recent days.The stock is overvalued when compared to peers.,"Square's (SQ) stock has been quiet since October. But shares have been coming back to life in recent days and could be about to surge even higher. The technical chart shows the equity is breaking out, as the options market has seen some bullish options betting.The biggest problem that Square still faces is its valuation, which is very lofty and makes the stock a risk over the longer term. This may be especially true if the earnings growth slows next year as consensus analysts estimates forecast.You can now track my success and failure rate for all of my free Seeking Alpha articles on this Google spreadsheet I created.The chart shows that the stock is breaking out rising above a level of technical resistance at $65.50. The stock has climbed to this region of resistance several times in November but has failed to advance. Now, the stock is finally pushing through, and that could result in the stock rising to the next level of resistance at $70. That is a gain of about 6.5% from the current stock price of $65.75 on November 18.Additionally, the relative strength index is now trending higher, and it would suggest that bullish momentum is coming into the stock. It would imply that the stock continues to rise.However, if the stock fails to stay above $65.50, and prove to be a false breakout, then the stock could slip lower towards $62.Someone is betting that the stock rises even higher than $70 by March 20. That is because the open interest for the March $75 calls saw their open interest increase by almost 10,000 on November 8. It sent the total open interest soaring to around 12,000 contracts.According to data provided by Trade Alert, the call options traded on the ASK, indicating that the calls were bought, and a bet that the stock will rise. The call contracts purchased for roughly $2.11 per contract. It means that the equity would need to rise above $77.10 by the expiration date for the buyer to earn a profit. That would be a gain of about 17.2% over the next few months.It is a big wager too. As of November 18, the contracts trade for $2.90, and that gives the total open interest a dollar value of $3.4 million. That is a lot of money to wager for a stock that has that far to travel for the next four months.The biggest problem that that stock may have longer term is its valuation. The equity currently trades at 67.6 times 2020 earnings estimates of $0.97. That is significantly higher than peers such as Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and PayPal (PYPL).Square's valuation is currently more than double PayPal, which is presently 31.2Data by YChartsBut the big problem for Square is that earnings growth is forecast to slow in the future. Consensus analysts' estimates currently forecast Square to see earnings growth of 66% in 2019, and then slow to just 25% in 2020. It makes the stock grossly overvalued, even when adjusting for growth. Another problem, those earnings estimates have been declining since early Spring.Data by YChartsIt seems at this point, investors may be willing to look past the long-term risk of Square and are focusing on short-term momentum. It could provide some investors who are nimble enough the opportunity for a near-term trade."
4314726,104941,2019-12-31T14:49:26-05:00,"Shopify and Square have approached essentially the same business from two opposing angles, but their valuations have diverged significantly. I answer why.The naysayers of both companies have been proven wrong and will continue to be proven wrong today, tomorrow, and into 2020s.I provide an example of ""The Noise"", of which every investor should be wary when playing the contact sport of investing in stocks.While an ideal capital split would be 50/50 between the two, valuations prevent me from recommending such an allocation at present. One is the obvious better buy.","Source: www.merchantmaverick.comBefore we dive into the comparison based on some financial metrics and intangibles, I'd, respectfully, like to shed some light on ""The Noise"", which every single investor faces when holding stocks. I will use a specific example so as to fully illustrate what investors face when buying individual stocks. I believe this is massively beneficial to new and old investors because it serves as a lesson and reminder that we should conduct our due diligence, make our own decisions, and stick to those decisions despite ""The Noise"", which could even come from trusted experts in the investing community at times.Boy, oh, boy have Square (NYSE:SQ) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) been great companies for the longs, the optimists, and the small business owners. Not only have the companies produced outsized gains for their investors over the last 3-5 years, they have also facilitated the growth of millions of small business owners' operations.Those for whom these have not been great investments have been the naysayers, the pessimists, the perennial bears, and a certain firm whose name begins with Cit and ends with ron. As an aside, we're looking forward to the charitable contribution Citron will be making in April of 2020 to the tune of $200k.Source: Citron's TwitterTo be fair, Shopify has one more earnings report on February 11th, 2020 before Citron's donation becomes set in stone.Though I haven't written on either of these companies as yet, you will find that throughout my comment history I've been a staunch advocate for Shopify, from when it was trading around $190. When it was trading at this level, ""The Noise"" was ringing loud and proud. The Citron bet you see above called for sub $100 within the year; however, for me, the narrative behind Shopify was just too compelling to believe that the market would allow an entry point below $150, much less below $100.I want to be clear that I'm not just hating on Citron. I don't dislike them because I focus on the long side of investing, and they the short side (usually). I actually believe they are essential market participants whose presence benefits all investors immensely, most of the time.I cite their call in April of 2019, because I think it's exceptionally important to portray to investors that ""experts"" can be wrong and are often wrong (Just look at Buffett's Kraft-Heinz investment). And if you feel convicted that a company is a great buy because you use their service or have had a great experience with the company, then you should remain resolute and stick with your investment, despite what any expert shouts at you through their hyperbolic writing and statistical speculations.So, I defended Shopify, purchased more of its stock and have ridden it to where it rests now in the low $400s.I certainly did not expect Shopify to rocket to its current price level. In fact, when I was defending the stock, I didn't entirely expect it to rise much into the 200s, as it was already priced very expensively; however, I knew such a tasty entry point as sub $100 wouldn't arrive without something of a black swan event for the company.With respect to Square, I've continued to add at its current 50s-60s price level for a few reasons.Source: YCharts.comFurther, relative to Shopify, Square offers a significantly more compelling value. At just around 6x sales and 40% sales growth, the company isn't what many would consider outlandishly expensive. Conversely, Shopify is what I think nearly everyone would consider outlandishly expensive. Such can be seen in the chart below.Source: YCharts.comFor just 32x sales, you can have the pleasure of owning a company that doesn't currently generate free cash flow. I say this tongue-in-cheek because Shopify's growth initiatives, such as Fulfillment by Shopify (which they initiated with a $450M investment in an already existing warehousing service, 6 Rivers Systems) are eating not only into their operating margins but also their free cash flow. Nevertheless, from whatever perspective you view Shopify, it is extremely expensive at its current valuation.So, from a valuation perspective, Square is unequivocally the better buy. In fact, I could not in any sense recommend buying Shopify at its current valuation, despite loving the company. Shopify is simply priced to absolute perfection, and the slightest slip-up in an earnings report or during a conference call could easily send the stock sliding 15-25%. Easily.What I find most interesting about Square and Shopify is that they were conceived with the same objective in mind: furnish to small business owners the tools to create the businesses of their dreams. However, the path to achieving this goal occurred at different ends of the small business spectrum for each of the companies, respectively.For Square, the original tool was the little square attachment that plugged into smartphones, which allowed merchants to receive payments from anywhere. This evolved into an entire POS system that served brick and mortar small businesses. This part of the narrative is essential to understanding how these companies are presently valued, because it sheds light on how they've evolved into the giants they are today and, more importantly, their trajectories moving forward.So, Square began catering to brick and mortar small businesses, and today, that remains their bread and butter. They have, however, entered into the online space more aggressively with their recent acquisition of Weebly. While this hardly scratches the surface of competing with Shopify, it does promote omni-channel execution by Square's primarily brick and mortar customers and ensures these small business owners can stay in Square's ecosystem without having to use the software of a competitor. Brick and mortar will continue to be a fantastic business for Square, as there are innumerable businesses that operate entirely offline, i.e., barbershops, ice cream parlors, and miniature golf courses to name a few.On the other hand, Shopify began catering to online sellers through what was essentially an online framework, into which small business owners would plug and play (read: sell) their offerings. Today, Shopify boasts over 1 million merchants on their platform (Find a list of their best hosted stores here.) Further, their gross sales volume is increasing at about 50% yoy.Shopify has emphasized creating tools for online sellers, and as a result, today, Shopify is basically the only option for individuals looking to sell their products, first and foremost, online through their own brand. Yes, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) allow small businesses to sell online, but no small business could truly develop their own brand without their own online storefront.As you've probably gleaned by now, Shopify has approached small business from an online first angle; whereas, Square has approached small business from a brick and mortar first angle. This has created very different realities for the companies in terms of what they can offer new or transitioning business owners, and their evolutions are worth considering when you decide into which company to pour your capital.Will e-commerce absolutely dominate brick and mortar in the future? I would say that e-commerce is having its time in the spotlight through its meteoric growth, but brick and mortar will persist, and businesses that cannot operate online will still usually seek out Square before any other option.Because of this dichotomy in their business models, i.e., Shopify focuses primarily on online sellers, and Square focuses primarily on brick and mortar, I believe we have seen a massive divergence in the two companies' valuations. While playing around with their charts, I stumbled on a comparison of what $10k would look like, had it been invested in the two companies five years ago. Source: YCharts.comFor the first few years, they traded in almost lockstep. However, recently, there has been a stark divergence between the two companies. I attribute this fact to the idea that Square's brick and mortar offering has been somewhat commoditized, though we could say the same for Apple's products, yet their strength of brand and quality of product continue to build and maintain their moat. Further, Investors have woken up to the massive moat that Shopify has constructed, (I'm about to make another Apple analogy... sorry) which is similar to the ecosystem Apple created, and out of which many ne'er venture. Shopify has become the central platform for developers to build apps that facilitate commerce on the internet, with over 3200 available to business owners that operate on Shopify.That is, while Square's moat has seemingly had bridges built over it left and right by competitors, Shopify has grown theirs in a prodigious way, through their ecosystem and now via Fulfillment by Shopify that investors have fallen in love with the narrative. Keep in mind that Square's moat that allegedly has all of these bridges continues to generate approximately 40% yoy revenue growth with around a 40% gross margin. Hardly a company that has been dismantled by a perfectly competitive industry.In sum, today, I recommend picking up only Square, because it actually offers a compelling valuation that has lagged the broader market. I would say Square is a ""growth at a reasonable price"" (GARP) situation, to quote the great Peter Lynch. In contrast, Shopify's valuation has taken the form of what I'd call ""irrational exuberance"". Yes, Shopify is the only option for small business owners looking to truly win at online retail. However, at the present price, there's just no room for error, and they are executing incredibly ambitious projects that won't roll out with absolute perfection over the next 12, 24, and 36 months. There will be some degree of reversion to the mean eventually for Shopify; at which time, I will write again and recommend that everybody buy the fantastic company that is Shopify."
4309303,105256,2019-11-26T16:08:02-05:00,"For the last few weeks I've been promoting the idea of riding the rips. I think now that this powerful rally is well accepted the market could favor relative laggards.Of the group reviewed, the charts favor Nutanix, Square, Home Depot and Splunk.The VIX is now below 12; it just makes sense to do some low-cost hedging. Cash is the cheapest hedge; trim some long-held positions.We are approaching my 3,150 top, and now it seems like Phase 1 will get approved. I now have no concrete reason why the market may sell off. That means people won't be psychologically prepared for it.","Yesterday morning, I had the notion that it might make sense now to look for names that may have been poorly treated by the market. By poorly treated I mean stocks that the market had misread their earnings and under a bit more review would have been found to be innocent.Take Nutanix (NTNX), they are rocking today after a great report. They say global spending on cloud is up. NTNX has fallen quite a bit over the last year or so. The big problem, actually two problems, is, first, the transition from a hardware-software ""go to market"" to a purely cloud-based subscription service. As the hardware portion of the sales goes away, it drives down the revenue; however, the software is where all the profit is. The last earnings report also showed some lumpy contract wins which really spooked the bulls. We have seen other young companies that have lumpy sales with delayed contracts. A great example is Arista Networks (ANET), which I am going to leave alone today but I think is a buy too. Let's chart NTNX, and see where it might go...Source: tradingview.comI can't believe I am saying this, but with the stock being up 5 points now, from a chart point of view, there is only about 4-5 additional points to the upside. Don't get me wrong, an inverse head and shoulders is very bullish, but it looks like the chart has already sniffed out the rally. If you look at the bottom of the formation which is the ""top"" of the head, you see that the low was about $17, then if you go up to the neckline, you have about $27ish. If you subtract the bottom from the top, you get 10 points which take us up to $37ish for an interim top. Could NTNX go higher? Of course. But we need more data, an analyst meeting, and new product announcements to take us higher. I think there might be a risk that NTNX falls to the right shoulder near $29ish. Let's wait a few days to decide to get in.The Bed Bath And Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) bull case has elements similar to the emerging recovery of General Electric (NYSE:GE). The new CEO of BBBY who has been fingered as the savior of BBBY is Mark Tritton. Mark was once Chief Merchandising Officer of the resurgent Target (NYSE:TGT). The similarity to Larry Culp, CEO of GE, is striking. Once the CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR) and credited with its fantastic growth over many years, it is Culp that is now widely credited with righting GE and putting it on a sustainable path. In the beginning, there was hope but also skepticism that he could get actually make a difference so late in the game. Similarly, Mark Tritton has a big task in front of him, but there seems to be optimism that he is the right man for the job. There have been reports of major and repeated call option buying in this name, meaning that market participants are expecting results pronto. We now have a new upgrade from Bank of America Merrill Lynch with a $20 PT. It promptly popped 5% yesterday and looks like there is more room to run. While BBBY has been improving for a while, it is up about 16% while the overall market is up about 25%. Let's see what the chart says...Source: tradingview.comWow, this is the 2nd negative surprise. The chart is not too exciting looking. Even though BBBY is up like 6% now, it looks like the stock is struggling at this level. I would wait for either the price to fall to the trendline of $13ish or wait for BBBY to break above $15. We seem to be in no man's land.We recently made note that Square (NYSE:SQ). It broke above a meaningful interim top of $66.37. I stated that since that level was broken significantly, it was likely that SQ was going back to the yearly highs. We aren't there yet, but SQ has been toying with the $69 level this week. Now we have an exciting upgrade from a Macquarie analyst, based on the Square Cash app and its torrid growth justifies a PT of $105! That is pretty close to its all-time high. I have felt for a long time that market participants have not been giving SQ their due. Let's see what the chart says...Source: tradingview.comFinally, a bullish chart, what a relief for me since I have been touting SQ for a long time. We see a long-established uptrend (first ascending line), then we have an accelerating uptrend (Second diagonal), and we have a huge gap down that will pull the price up like a magnet. Aside from my own bias, you can look at the chart to decide. I can make a long-winded defense of SQ from the fundamental side. I don't think that payments are the only reason that SQ is an excellent risk. I believe in the narrative that small business is doing much better than what is being tracked by economists. Main Street is doing better than Wall Street. SQ is a fantastic champion of small business, not just about low cost and convenient point-of-sale tools, but its lending business. In any case, the chart agrees and I am relieved. SQ is a BUYSplunk (SPLK) beat on revenue and earnings in their just-released earnings report; they also raised fiscal year guidance. SPLK is another young company that has had lumpy sales. The fact that they raised guidance goes a long way to reassure investors that have been burned before. It jumped more yesterday when Argus Research pointed to SPLK as an ideal acquisition target. It is a best-of-breed big data tool that can surface machine generated data. SPLK can be used in enterprise application performance to cyber-security, among other uses. Let's look at the chart and see where it could run...Source: tradingview.comClearly, SPLK is breaking out. This means there is no overhead resistance. Hard to figure out where it can go, but the chart pattern seems to have a periodicity of about 18 to 20 points. That would take us to about $158 to $160ish. Argus Research had their PT at $157. This is also the average PT among 39 analysts that cover it. The outlier has a PT of $202. Just beware that SPLK has popped about 18% in just a few days.American Express (AXP) has been in business news the last few days because it is making big cash rewards to retailers to incentivize them to carry the AMEX card. I applaud the more aggressive stance by the C-Suite of AXP, if not the exact tactic. Based on the strength of Square Cash app, you might think that I would be an AXP bear, but I think there is tremendous room in the Fintech space. I think AXP could raise its profile both at the register and in the stock market. If the Phase One trade deal comes through, then the AMEX card or at least the brand and service could find a more companionable environment in China. Right now they have to be in a joint venture. Phase One is purported to free up the financial sector in China. The chart says:Source: tradingview.comYou have a nice inverted ""head and shoulders"". When you count the lowest point of the ""head"" to the neckline, you get about 8 points. That should get you to the previous high, not that big a pop, but this is not a high beta name. This is more of a slow money situation, but if they do get freed up in China, this could be a runner.My final name is Home Depot (HD). This name has been on my radar to pull the trigger. Finally, HD has started turning. I think stock market participants unfairly dumped HD. Check out the chart...Source: tradingview.comI think HD will offer a chance for alpha now. I don't think it's going to charge back to old highs in a week. I think that if you are looking to find a stock that can work with all aspects of homebuilding - new homes, old homes, sales, renovations - HD offers a 2.5% dividend so it qualifies even for conservative investing as well.Chesapeake Energy (CHK): Scotiabank analyst upgraded from a Sector Perform to an Outperform.My Take: As you may recall, we observed insider buying after the ""Going Concern"" filing. I was very tempted to pull the trigger then. So the fact that a known name iBank is upgrading this dicey name has my attention. Who doesn't love an underdog? It's trading for pennies. Obviously, you don't put anywhere near significant money on something like this. If you have bet on football for 100 bucks, then yeah throw a few bucks at this one. I still will have this name on my radar and looking for another confirmation, so for me, it's not a buy yet. I will keep you posted, but I am even more interested.AIG's (NYSE:AIG) Fortitude Re goes to Carlyle and T&D Holdings for $1.8 billion.StubHub sold to Viagogo by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for $4 billion.The bottom line, the real market participants are looking to transact business before the year ends.Revolve Group (RVLV) 12/4CrowdStrike (CRWD) 12/9Fiverr (FVRR) 12/10Chewy (CHWY) 12/11Grocery Outlet (NASDAQ:GO) 12/17*Slack (WORK) 12/17RealReal (REAL) 12/25My Take: I want you to be cognizant of the fact that these names could come under selling pressure next month. Whether you own them now, or are looking at them from an investment perspective, you should plan around these dates. They don't always fall with the lockup expiration, just be aware.The VIX is under 12; you can create a 12 by 18 call spread with a January expiration for just under $300 per contract. Please don't over-hedge. If you are a first-timer, don't hedge more than 2-3%. You should also include a put spread on the SPY. At this point, the chatter is that the deal is really happening, so I have no idea what could sell this market. I am at this point working off of the notion that 3,150 is probably the highs for 2019. The way the rally is running, we may just hit 3,200, which was my original top. We are heading for an overbought condition as well. So this is just trading hygiene. The best hedge is cash. Please chip off a few shares of each older position you are in, in your trading account. The goal is building a 25% cash cache minimum.I added to my Anaplan (PLAN), DocuSign (DOCU) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) calls. I spread my Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) and DOCU calls. I am looking to go long on the VIX today or at least before the week ends. I swept some cash out of my trading account and bought more GE equity for my investment account."
4305795,69905,2019-11-12T14:06:01-05:00,"Q3 2019 had a surprising EBITDA bump, but this not going to recur.Looking under the hood and searching for free cash flow.Why this stock should be avoided.","Square (NYSE:SQ) is an investment I have been bearish about for a considerable amount of time.Looking back, I first charged that Square was overvalued more than a year ago, with an article titled Irrational Price. This is the stock's performance since then:Source: author's coverageBelow is my unwavering stance over the past twelve months:Yet, today, the fact that Square's EBITDA growth rates are slowing down is more evident than ever before. Meanwhile, its stock remains incredibly expensive.On balance, this stock should be avoided.I'll be the first to admit that Q3 2019 adjusted EBITDA growth rates of 85% left me flummoxed.Source: author's calculationsWe can see that, from 2017 onwards, there is a consistent decline in EBITDA growth rates. Furthermore, Q1 2019 and Q2 2019 also saw declines.Nevertheless, somehow Q3 2019 posted an incredible reversal and posted 85% y/y growth.Looking back to Square's Q2 2019 results, at the midpoint of its Q3 2019 guidance, Square was expecting around $108 million versus the $131 million it actually delivered.Readers probably assume that Square was sandbagging its results, right? Partially yes, but also this bump in EBITDA growth rates was also due to the timing of operating expenses.Specifically, when questioned further on the call, Square's CFO Amrita Ahuja acknowledges thatIn other words, this bump in growth rates is not only unsustainable but will reverse in the coming quarters.Putting aside the huge bump in Q3 2019, Square's full-year 2019 results are now only guided to increase its full-year EBITDA growth rates by 1% to 61% (shown in the graph above).Thus, there is no question that Square's adjusted growth rates are going to continue to slow down going forward. The important question is just how fast?Will 2020 be marked by EBITDA growth rates of 50%, or will be it be slower and closer to the growth rates we are expecting to see for Q4 2019 (approximately 41%)?To be fair, CEO Jack Dorsey, who is also Twitter's (TWTR) CEO, is not one to shy away from innovation. For instance, Q3 2019 was marked by a brand-new product, Square's fractionalization of stocks with its Cash App platform.Furthermore, Dorsey highlighted on the call that positive network effects are starting to come into play, as friends or employees invite others onto this platform for ease of payments.Therefore, Square's Seller ecosystem and Cash App are benefiting from plenty of cross-selling, which should help to solidify Square's overall competitive advantage.On the other hand, Square's narrative aside, the graph below speaks louder than any words.Source: author's calculations, SEC filingsWe can see highlighted the discrepancy between Square's adjusted EBITDA and its free cash flow (once we factor out stock-based compensation and capex and intangibles).For its year-to-date performance, Square's free cash flow is only just generating $139 million - which pushes the question, just how much of a bargain are investors really getting when they put up close to $30 billion for Square?Many readers will be quick to retort that Square is not being valued on its potential cash flows, but rather on its potential growth rates.To this, I would note that even though Square's growth rates are clearly slowing down, the multiple investors are happy to pay to participate in the stock is anything but slowing down.Source: author's calculations, SEC filingsEveryone can look back and understand that, historically, Square was a wonderfully rewarding investment. But what matters right now is how will Square fair going forward?Even if Square delivers results in line with guidance, given that investors have such high expectations of this stock which only just makes a GAAP profit, investors are priming themselves for disappointment.SourceSquare continues to plow ahead with its ethos of empowering sellers.My sole contention is that new shareholders are going to struggle to find any positive upside potential while paying close to $30 billion market cap."
4305918,105459,2019-11-12T15:55:49-05:00,"We believe SQ's share price has limited upside from the current level due to the competitive concerns and limited margin upside.Competition rising from traditional acquirers and new entrants such as Clover and Toast that could take shares away from SQ.Our valuation of $65/share implies 45x EV/EBITDA, in-line with Adyen.","We are initiating on Square (SQ) with a neutral view as we expect limited upside on the share price as the company enters an investment year. Our target price of $62/share implies limited upside from the current level and implies 45x forward EV/EBITDA, in line with its peer Adyen.The growing competition from other merchant acquirer startups and the investment could weigh in on margins in the foreseeable future. Although consensus expects revenue and margins to recover by 2021E, we think it is still early to tell and SQ has started to become a show-me story that needs to convince the street it can withstand the competitive onslaught.On the positives, we like SQ as we believe it is one of few disruptive and innovative merchant acquirers that have a solid penetration within the SMBs given its integrated payment solution, best-in-class hardware and intuitive software that can be readily adopted by any SMBs. The total addressable market for SQ is favorable as we estimate that SQ only has less than 2% market share of the SMBs. As merchants continue to upgrade their payment infrastructure and POS amid the gradual transition towards the cashless society due to the rise of digital wallets, we think SQ is favorably positioned for the overall macro trend.In terms of valuation, SQ is currently trading at 50x forward EBITDA, in-line with its three-year average.Most of the merchant acquirers trade between 15x - 20x EBITDA but have a much slower growth profile.We value SQ at 45x forward EV/EBITDA, a premium compared with peers as we believe that it is still a growth story but a lower multiple is appropriate given the near-term competitive headwind and margin pressure. At our target multiple, SQ is largely in-line with Adyen, which has a similar revenue growth profile.Our target implies limited share price appreciation following the recent weakness. Unless there is material rebound in GPV and margin expansion, we believe that shares could trade sideways in the near term or trend lower if the competitive dynamics shift unfavorably.Risks to our thesis include:Competition heating upSQ's GPV growth has decelerated in recent years in what we consider to be signs of increasing competition from the alternative merchant acquirers that also offer simplified products and services to the merchants as well as from the traditional acquirers that have undergone consolidation.So far in 2019, the mergers of Fiserv/First Data, FIS/WorldPay, and Global Payments/Total System have brought together the large bank tech players as well as the merchant acquirers to gain better unit economics, expand the geographic footprint and achieve better economy of scale. The resulting companies can achieve better integration of the core processing, issuer processing, and merchant processing services, and allow them to better acquire and retain merchants as much of the business services migrate to the digital platform. More importantly, access to a large pool of data could facilitate cross-selling of ancillary services such as POS financing. All this could have an impact on the competitive landscape surrounding SQ, in our view.Notably, FDC's Clover payment directly competes with SQ in the SMB segment. Clover is already integrated with the major payment platforms at the major banks including Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and PNC. With the FDC/FISV merger, Clover could be easily integrated into the smaller banks that run on the FISV core banking platform, whereas before such rollout would be considered time-consuming and less efficient.We believe that Clover could potentially become a serious contender to SQ given Clover's better value proposition to the merchants in terms of pricing, hardware, and customer service.On processor compatibility, Clover allows the merchant to choose any processor that supports Clover so the increased number of choices results in better pricing for the merchant when negotiating credit card processing. This flexibility is not available for SQ.In terms of hardware, SQ was certainly early-mover into the mobile reader scene but Clover Go has a more convenient all-in-one reader that allows the merchant to take magstripe, chip, and contactless payment. SQ, on the other hand, currently does not offer a combo reader for smartphones that accept magstripe, EMV, and NFC all-in-one.When we look at the terminals Clover Flex and Square Terminal, both are touch-screen and lightweight with a built-in printer. However, Clover Flex is slightly longer as it has an NFC reader built-in and also it has a barcode scanner, whereas SQ Terminal does not, so this makes it easier for merchants to scan barcodes at checkout.In terms of pricing, Clover is more attractive to merchants that accept cards via swiping, dipping and tapping, and average transaction over $10 as well as accepting more than $3,000/month in cards. In addition, Clover's software for POS has a lower monthly cost compared to that of SQ's so it appears to be a better choice for SMB merchants.Finally, on customer service, Clover operates 24/7/365 merchant helpline and merchants can send questions via email. SQ certainly has an extensive knowledge base but most of the customer service is email-based and the phone support is only from 6 am-6 pm Pacific Time.Besides Clover, there are other competitors that investors should be mindful of such as Toast, which has gained good traction within the restaurant vertical as it can handle more customers, service types, digital ordering, check splitting and multi-location management tools that make it ideal for restaurant owners. In terms of an online order, SQ is more suitable for retail stores but Toast works with restaurants to set up direct integration with POS to sync both menu and pricing for the online customers.The growing competition is starting to cause merchants to churn from SQ's platform. We note that Joe & the Juice recently switched to rival Adyen, which has a bigger international presence than SQ. At a more local level, Morgan & York, a quick-service concept based out of Michigan also switched to Toast from Square.The current churn is not alarming as it is just the nature of the competitive market, in our view. However, we will be concerned if the churn accelerates and results in lower GPV growth in the SMB segment.In conclusion, we remain cautious on SQ due to growing competitive risk and see limited upside in share price at the current level. Potential merchant churn, investments in merchant acquisition and GPV growth uncertainty could make this stock volatile once the underlying metrics show some stabilization."
4305956,22148,2019-11-12T18:25:24-05:00,Square beat Q3 estimates.The company will quit reporting adjusted revenues due to communication from the SEC.The end result is a focus on bottom line metrics pointing towards the stock trading at a max value.Square trades at 63x '20 EBITDA guidance.,"Along with the Q3 report, Square (SQ) offered a lot for investors to absorb. The fintech saw the core business beat estimates while the removal of weak Caviar made the comparisons difficult. All while the company is moving away from reporting adjusted revenues due to SEC guidance causing further confusion. My investment thesis still has the stock overvalued based on the $31 billion market cap and adjusted revenues of $2.5 billion, suggesting investors should let all of the revenue confusion shake out before finding the stock interesting.Image Source: Square websiteNo other metric has dictated the stock price of Square since their IPO than the revenue growth metric. The stock struggled with decelerating revenue growth following the IPO until the company hit a growth spurt in 2017. Square surged to $100 based on growth boosted by acquisitions, with the stock peaking right before revenue started decelerating.Data by YChartsThe stock now faces revenue growth decelerating to 30% in 2020, down from over 40% in Q3. It doesn't really matter whether one uses the metric of net or adjusted revenue or includes or excludes Caviar from the comparisons to derive the negative trend continuing into 2020. All of these different numbers just add to the confusion.Source: Square Q3'19 shareholder letterOf course, the market is bound to look at the net revenues now with $145 million from Caviar missing from the 2020 estimates when Square officially reports net revenues. On the Q3 earnings call, CFO Amrita Ahuja guided to adjusted revenue growth, ex Caviar, in the low 30% range:No matter how one slices the numbers, Square expects revenue growth to decelerate from the low 40% rate in 2019 to the low 30% level in 2020.According to a letter from Square, the Division of Corporation Finance of the SEC sent a comment letter to the company about the use of adjusted revenue metrics. The fintech started using the metric in November 2015 and will now discontinue the metric with Q4 earnings.As long stated by Square, the removal of passthrough transaction-based costs, and now bitcoin costs, made for a more informed financial picture. The company even implies the internal use of the metric will continue, suggesting the SEC is again pushing the company towards less disclosures to investors.The odd part about this move is that Square accurately disclosures both the adjusted and net revenues. In fact, the adjusted revenues are typically about 50% of the net revenues, and most hyper growth companies want to point the biggest revenue picture possible.Source: Square Adjusted Revenue FAQFor Q3, the adjusted revenues were only $602 million, while the net revenues were $1,266 million. The company stripped out $519 million in transaction-based costs and $146 million in bitcoin costs to arrive at a non-GAAP measure for revenues.The only real point against the non-GAAP revenue measure is the gross margin assigned to the different business models. For Q3, Square generated $500 million in gross profits. Under the adjusted revenues, the gross margin is 83%. Under the net revenues, the gross margin is only 39%.An investor might view Square in a far different light with a listed gross margin of only 39%. The market prefers a high margin business with repeatable transactions or subscriptions versus a low margin business with one-time transactions.The end result is that investors likely shift away from a view of buying the stock based off a multiple of revenues to bottom line metrics. A company with net revenues set to top $5 billion in 2020 probably should be viewed in a more mature light.For 2019, Square forecasts adjusted EBITDA of at least $410 million and an EPS of $0.77. At a market cap of $31 billion, the stock is worth 76x EBITDA estimates and 83x EPS estimates.Source: Square Q3'19 shareholder letterGoing to 2020, adjusted revenue is targeted at $2.7 billion with similar EBITDA margins of 18% due to investments in sales and marketing. The company forecasts adjusted EBITDA of $490 million placing the stock trading at 63x 2020 EBITDA targets.The key investor takeaway is that maturity of Square and the more normalized revenue growth, along with a shift away from adjusted revenues, will push the investment community to value the stock based on more traditional valuation metrics. The stock remains at max value above $60 based on EBITDA growing about 20% in 2020 on 30% revenue growth.The removal of the adjusted revenue figure is a nuisance, but the move doesn't alter the stock trading at a premium valuation in the $60s as growth decelerates."
4304256,100666,2019-11-08T08:05:13-05:00,"Square has had a lot of negative comments but they are not based on how the company performs but just on the stock price.Square posted excellent Q3 2019 results, which can be summarized by beat, beat, raise.Square's two ecosystems give the company a lot of options for monetization.The moat that Square has is the fact that everything ties together.","I have written five previous articles about Square (SQ) over the last eight months. If you have read any of them (thank you for that), you will know that I am bullish on the stock over the long term, the only term that matters to me. (Source)The reason why I have written quite a few articles is to help investors see through the clouds. In this case they are the negative comments about the business and the stagnating stock price.This is Square's stock price over the last year:Data by YChartsNothing to get excited about. But as an investor, you have to phase out. Square has had a huge growth before and now it's slowly growing into its valuation. This is what Square's stock price did before the last year:Data by YChartsJust give it time. As long as the results keep coming, the stock price will follow. And results, that is the actual theme of this article.On Wednesday, November 6, Square released its Q3 2019 results. We will analyze these together.I'm reading a very interesting investment book, which I recommend to those who love my Potential Multibaggers series: 100 Baggers by Christopher Mayer.(Source)In this book, the author often refers to Thomas Phelps' book 100 to 1 In The Stock Market. One of the investment tips that Mayer cites from Phelps is to look at the business numbers without looking at the stock price at all. If you don't know the stock price, would you hold the company based on the business results alone? If the answer is yes, just hold the stock and don't sell, no matter if it is overpriced or undervalued.If you didn't know what company this was and you would see this chart, would you be tempted to sell it? I know I wouldn't.Data by YChartsThis is the growth of Square's gross margins:Data by YChartsDon't these metrics look a lot better without the price, which often distracts us from seeing the fundamentals?Too many investors base their judgment on what the price of a stock does, not on how the business performs. That's exactly how you trail an S&P 500 index (SPY). The average 100 bagger took more than 21 years to become a 100 bagger. Before you scoff at this holding period: that's turning $10,000 into $1M. You need a CAGR of 24.5% for this, which is clearly not so simple. But it is attainable if you hold your stocks and ignore price changes.Square had great results. The revenue is up almost 40% YoY to $602.22M, beating consensus by $5.37M. For a growth company like Square, this is one of the key metrics to look at. Square's products are sticky and therefore it is important to get merchants on their platform and to get consumers on Cash App.Talking about Cash App. I have been stressing the importance of this platform, Square's second ecosystem, over and over again. I think investors and pundits don't see the complete potential of Cash App to the full and that is one of the reasons why the stock price stays stagnant.Cash App's revenue came in at $307M. That is already 51% of Square's total revenue. Amazing, in just three years.The gross profit on that $307M was $123M or a 40% gross profit margin. But it's even better than it looks. On Cash App, you can trade bitcoins (BTC-USD) and this accounts for $148M of revenue, but there the gross margin is very low (just 0.01%). The most important is the rest of the Cash App revenue, which brought in $159M, up 115% YoY. Maybe even more important is the gross profit of $121M, up 125% YoY, which means a gross profit margin of 76%. These are numbers that you want to see as an investor.On the bottom line, non-GAAP EPS were up a whopping 92.3% to $0.25 beating the consensus by $0.05. GAAP EPS came in at $0.06, beating the $0.00 consensus by a wide margin.Square guided conservatively again. Just for context: for Q3, the company guided $0.18 - $0.20 for EPS. The result: $0.25, 31% more than the midpoint. For revenue, Square guided $590M-$600M and the result was $602.22M. This was not an outlier. Square has an established tradition of underpromising and overperforming.For its Q4 2019 revenue, Square guided a range of $585M to $595M, while analysts saw $621.24M. If you see this, you may wonder why the stock didn't fall. But Square's guidance was somewhat complicated this time and I had the impression that some investors couldn't figure out the guidance correctly at first. Although it seems a big guidance miss, Square has actually raised its FY 2019 guidance. There are two important elements that influence the new guidance. The first is, of course, the sale of Caviar. It was expected to contribute $45M to the revenue in Q4. The other factor is this:(Amrita Ahuja, Square's CFO on the Q3 2019 conference call)This means that Square raises its guidance by $15M. Knowing the company's history, I'm pretty confident that it will beat this guidance again.Square is the proud owner of not one but two ecosystems: the merchant system and that of consumers (with Cash App). Square's CEO Jack Dorsey understands this all too well. The development of the two ecosystems and especially the combination of the two gives Square a huge runway for growth. Jack Dorsey on the Q3 2019 conference call:Just imagine that merchants can advertise on Cash App, based on the transactions that users make. That's so much more powerful than what Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) or Facebook (FB) do, because Square can look at the actual purchases. It's like Amazon's (AMZN) advertising business. That company, of course, also knows very well what you buy. Of course, Square is not of Amazon's size. Amazon had a total of $3.6B in advertising income in Q3 2019 with a total revenue of $70B. So that's about 5% that comes from advertising. If Square could reach that same percentage, it would boost its top line by about $130M, based on FY2019 revenue. Most of that money would directly go to the bottom line since advertising is a low cost model. Square could also use loyalty programs and many more products and services to tie the two ecosystems together.Now, just to make sure, Square has not made any comments whatsoever that it has any plans in the direction of advertising but it seems a logical step to me. CEO Jack Dorsey on the Q3 2019 conference call:That's bold language and I love it. Square has got the talent and the money to make this work. The sale of Caviar brought extra cash. I have already stated that it was good that Caviar was sold to DoorDash. There is simply too much competition in food delivery and the margins are razor-thin. The collapse of Grubhub (GRUB) seems to illustrate that again. Of course, the money that is freed up in the transaction gives Square room to strengthen its network. Jack Dorsey looks at the merchants' side first. This is what he said on the Q3 2019 conference call:For Cash App, stock trades have been introduced to the platform. I have already argued that this is a very strong new feature and it will add again to the strength of the ecosystem. Can you name one other platform where you can do all of your money transactions, buy stocks and bitcoin on one platform? Jack Dorsey about Cash App on the Q3 2019 conference call:A lot of people ask what Square's moat is. Once you get the integration of all the different parts of the ecosystem, together they form a moat. Jack Dorsey on competition on the Q3 2019 conference call:Of course, a lot of bears won't be convinced by this argument. But a moat is built out over time. What was Starbucks' (SBUX) moat in its beginning years? It took a while before investors realized it was the concept of the third place.Square is just starting to scratch the surface when it comes to international expansion. For Cash App, you get this message if you look at international payments:So expanding Cash App internationally can be a very good and logical investment for Square.For the seller ecosystem, that too is still in its infancy. It has only been rolled out in the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia, and Japan. The terminal products were only introduced in the last quarter in Canada, Australia and the UK. So, again, this shows how Square can grow exponentially internationally over the coming years.Square has again printed a very strong quarter: beat, beat, raise. The fact that the two ecosystems have not been tied together yet and that internationally Square is only scratching the surface are just a few clear signs that Square is just only starting out and has a long runway to expand.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from a long-term perspective, feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!P.S.

4303849,105417,2019-11-07T14:44:15-05:00,"EBITDA Margin remains solid, despite incremental marketing investments.
        Targeted pricing reductions affect hardware products and boost revenue growth.
        Sale of Caviar business continues to signal astute M&A management.","Square, Inc. is a financial services company that focuses on software and hardware payments products. Square Register allows merchants to accept offline debit and credit cards on both smart-phones and tablet computers. Merchants enter card details through the Square Reader, which plugs into the supported smart-phone/tablet and reads the magnetic stripe.We see Square as uniquely positioned to take advantage of several major developments in the evolution of point-of-sale (POS) transactions and, indeed, the payments world as a whole over the last decade. The company stands at the forefront of payment processing, adopting and integrating recent trends. At the same time, Square’s products cater to a wide variety of merchants, from retail stores to restaurants to cabs, particularly smaller businesses – those that are often overlooked by Square’s established competitors in the terminals space, such as VeriFone and Ingenico.On Track to Maintain EBITDA Margin: We believe that the company's expense management is on track and should help it maintain approximately 15% EBITDA margin, much like we expected. Per management's commentary, the company should now be able to increase its marketing efforts and still comfortably maintain margin expectations. Specifically, the CFO said: ""We expect to invest over $75 million in incremental seller sales and marketing over 2019 levels, targeting payback periods to remain within four quarters.""CashApp Revenue to Decelerate But to Remain Strong: We expect CashApp Revenue to decelerate from its 110% Y/Y growth but still grow well in the 40%-50% range. The most significant drivers of CashApp, Instant Deposit and Cash Card, will be growing in 2020 off of a larger base, but should still post an impressive performance. Targeted Pricing Reductions: The company has recently reduced price tags on some newer hardware devices, such as Square Register and Square Terminal, which in turn fostered sharp sales increased of as much as 20%. We view these opportunistic pricing actions as very important to the health of Square's overall business, particularly since they are not driven by the competition from VeriFone and Ingenico, but mainly take place as a result of the company's intent to have various business units demonstrate solid double-digit growth. Recall, Square charges merchants a payment processing fee of 2.40%-2.75% on gross purchase volume (GPV), which is meaningfully below the merchant discount rate (MDR) of 3-4% that merchants frequently pay on non-Square transactions. In addition, the company charges a 2.5%-3.5% fee and $0.15 per transaction fee for manually entered card-not-present transactions (where the incidence of fraud may be substantially greater). We note that about 63% of transactions are card-present and approximately 27% are CNP. M&A Works Both Ways: Finally, we are pleased by the fact that the company stands ready to acquire new businesses as much as it stands ready to sell those that do not fit its profile or are not profitable. Recent sale of Caviar to DoorDash (completed on October 31) is the prime example of the company's ability to recognize that not only Caviar's potential did not live up to that of the rest of the business, but there were in fact few synergies.Investor Day in March: The company announced its Investor Day in March, which we plan to attend and provide another update then on various technology innovations.When we compare Square against its peers in the payments industry, such as VeriFone and Ingenico, as well as other players, such as GPN, ADS, V, and MA, among others, we find that the company merits a revenue multiple of 6.4x on 2020 revenue, which would result in the target price of $74. We note that our estimates and target price did not change, since these quarterly results were already largely priced in our multiple. We see the following risks to our thesis.1. Competitive Pressures:Square’s success could lead to entrance of new players, who would eat away a portion of the company’s market share2. Pricing Wars:We believe that SQ may more pricing headwinds from VeriFone and, to a lesser extent, Ingenico. Square already offers one of the lowest-priced products in this space; however, other companies are aggressively catching up.3. Economic Slowdown:As economy gradually softens in the United States, Europe, and China, we may see fewer lower payments volume, but, even more importantly, we may see fewer new merchants joining Square’s platform.4. Rise of Alternative Payment Solutions:With the payments space rapidly developing, we believe that a rise of various alternative solutions, particularly on the mobile side, possesses a significant threat to Square. Merchants are increasingly looking for an opportunity to save on the discount rate, which should foster more research in that direction and thus pose a meaningful threat to Square."

Instead, the market closed flat. Today, we have news that China and the US agreed to a phased approach for reducing tariffs. Steady incremental progress on trade is all the market wants, recession off the table, and benign interest rate environment where interest rate movement is taken off the table all adds up to the removal of all the market bogeymen. So far 75% S&P 500 companies beat earnings, and the average is 65%. This furthers confirmation that a melt-up is afoot; you are also hearing this from other market participants. What will add fuel to the fire is further confirmation of the ""ROW"", Rest of World, also returning to growth, or at least not caving any further. We have seen better news of Japan and also some firming in China (private surveys, I don't trust the communist party stats) and better news in Germany. How do we know this? The synchronized rise in interest rates the world over. I even heard some commentators start using the meme ""melt-up."" I don't know if I was the first to talk of it, but I am pretty early on this, and it is still early.The generals are running in the pre-market. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) are resuming their breakout, and in the case of GOOGL, we are just broke out to fresh all-time highs. Amazon (AMZN) will now catch up as well. The Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) has broken to new highs. Even GE, not a leader, but a name that has been running, is running again. I may regret selling it soon. I am going to hold off and see if it breaks above its 52-week high @ $11.30, and then I'm going to get back in.Market participants might be cheering the prejudice against all hyper-growth companies that aren't generating profits but that is to wide a net to cast. Companies that have a fantastic business model and good FCF but are choosing to invest in their business are ones that I want to invest in, like ROKU. This is setting up some of the best trades in front of me. At the time of this writing, ROKU the blow-up du jour has gone from 116 to 126, which is still down 10%. I believe it will make that backup and go appreciably higher. More about that in My Trading Corner below. McDonald's (MCD) is repairing the damage from the Easterbrook resignation. Match (MTCH) got an upgrade and lifting nicely.Twitter (TWTR) has already been punished for its stupid mistakes in its ad-server and also to my mind banning political ads. To me, banning a legal category of ads is a luxury that Twitter cannot afford. That's a signal that it isn't focused on growing the business. On top of that, now the shares falling 2.5% again after the DOJ charged two former employees with spying for Saudi Arabia in part by digging into user accounts on the service. I would wait a day and add to your position or initiate for a trade.Buy MCD, MTCH, and TWTR. The same can't be said for Expedia (EXPE)Expedia seems to have intrinsic problems, and TripAdvisor (TRIP) also underperformed. Expedia's stock is sliding after earnings miss estimates and full-year guidance is cut. TripAdvisor came out with quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share, missing the consensus estimate of $0.69 per share and posted revenues of $428 million for the quarter ended September 2019, missing the Zacks consensus estimate by 6.22%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $458 million. This compares to earnings of $0.72 per share a year ago. I would be wary about Booking.com (BKNG) tonight. I am not sure why the travel booking sector is underperforming, but it might be its business model. Perhaps this is another ""Empire Strikes Back"" scenario where the airline and hotels are taking back that disintermediation.Institutional investors in October went from 3:1 bearish to 2:1 bullish, 54% bullish or slightly bullish on risky assets and said they believe that there is ""still gas in the tank"" and ""path of least resistance is up"". You don't need more confirmation that we are in a bull market, but let's look at this for a moment. Sure, when people start getting bullish usually, I start talking about heading for the door. In this case, we are talking about institutional investors, and they don't turn on a dime. I think this is as I said a confirmation that there is more power pushing the momentum forward. All systems are a GO for Melt-Up...Perhaps I am late to the game on the financials, but now that the 10-year is moving decisively, I think there is more gas in the tank. My preferences were for Wells Fargo (WFC) and Goldman Sachs (GS). I left JPMorgan (JPM) aside since I thought it moved the most already. Now I see JPM has decisively to breaking out, and in this kind of market, it's time to buy breakouts if you're a trader. I don't know the regional banks, but they should be doing much better too. The Regional Bank ETF (KRE) could be interesting as well.As for the homebuilder sector, I have mostly focused on the builders themselves, but it also makes sense to look at the ""parts"" suppliers like a Masco (DOOR), or a Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS), a Lowe's (LOW), or a Mohawk Industries (MHK), and a Trex (TREX). The reason I like these is that they encompass not only just new homes but also home improvement as well. One final thing, why do I recommend LOW over Home Depot (HD)? Two things. Everyone is already in HD and LOW is getting competitive and is cheaper on a PE basis.Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) buying local TV stations. It targeted the Nexstar stations because of its presence in NFL markets. Fox Corp. is continuing its spree of acquisitions, buying three local TV stations in Seattle and Milwaukee from Nexstar Media Group in a deal valued at $350 million. The stations, KCPQ and KZGO in Seattle and WITI in Milwaukee, were targeted by Fox because they are in ""two key markets that align with the company's sports rights,"" Fox said in announcing the pact. The Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers both play in the National Football Conference, where Fox has extensive NFL rights. If you recall, I advised that traders that want to express their bullishness regarding TV advertising in this looming political season to buy Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (SBGI). Now I learned that Fox is not sitting on its laurels and is boosting its broadcasting coverage in the local market to better take advantage of the NFL footprint and perhaps Barron's has got a good idea as well. SBGI has a much better dividend if you are thinking about this opportunity as a long-term investment.Square (SQ) is up nearly 2% in after-hours after earnings. It reported an EPS of $0.25 vs. the estimated $0.20 and reported revenue of $602 mln vs. the estimated $596.85 mln. I am a fan of SQ. I think SQ has spent enough time in the penalty box. I think the chart is showing a change to the bullish side for SQ. Let's start with the three-month chart:At first blush, the inverted ""head and shoulders"" is always bullish, but for SQ overall, it has made a lot of attempts to break above this mid-60s level and failed before. However, the sharp pop today gives me confidence that in a ""melt-up"" environment that SQ will perform. Here is the six-month chart and where I can make my case for optimism.Here we see a few peaks that reach 66 over the last five months. If SQ punches through this level and holds it, the two arrows on the left give cause to be optimistic for more alpha. In charting there is a general rule that stock prices tend to fill the gaps. The right-most arrow is the latest gap down. SQ should go on to fill that gap-down and take SQ into the 70s and then into the 80s. If Square gets momentum, then PayPal (PYPL) should bull up as well. I would consider SQ and PYPL for a buy.Masonite International (DOOR): Stifel Nicolaus upgrade from Hold to Buy, yet Royal Bank of Canada downgrades DOOR Outperform to Sector Perform.Lowe's Corporation: Credit Suisse Group AG from Neutral to Outperform.My take: I think DOOR makes sense if you believe that housing should continue to do well.Apple: Goldman Sachs raises the PT to $192, a 25% upside.Datadog (DDOG): Credit Suisse Group AG initiates with a Neutral and a $40 PT, 14.6% upside.Ping Identity (PING): Credit Suisse Group AG initiates with an Outperform and a PT of $21, an upside of 27%.I had ROKU on a tight call spread with only $300 value at risk. ROKU fell hard, more than I expected, down 20 points in the pre-market. I intend to roll down the short call and turn my vertical spread into a calendar spread. I will then add to my long side at a lower strike price and effectively create a one by two spread. My expiration is out to January and I am pretty confident that ROKU will rise above even my original strike price. Why confidence? I believe that Roku-powered TVs and Roku sticks will be one of the biggest sellers for Christmas. Also, ROKU beat on earnings (lower losses), beat on revenue, beat on subscriber growth and beat on ARPU. Market participants knew the value proposition going into the earnings, so why the sell-off? The algos/robots have now been tuned to short any stock that reports losses, no matter how strong the business model. I think the ""Buy the Bomb"" theme is a winner. Cramer just got on and said ROKU disappointed. Am I allowed to disagree with him? Respectfully I do. ROKU is the single best pure-play on the turn to streaming. ROKU brings strong ad serving to OTT. Roku Channel is generating good ad revenue, which is the key to the biz model. There are a bazillion streamers besides Netflix (NFLX), Disney+ (NYSE:DIS), Hulu, HBO, but even among the big boys at this point, where is the best place to market your service or show? That's right, ROKU.If the algos are tuned to punish all companies that have falling earnings, then Disney might very well be punished today. If you own DIS in a long-term account, consider writing calls. Talk to your financial advisor and see if she agrees. Disney's consensus EPS estimate is $0.97 (-34.5% Y/Y) and revenue estimate is $19.02B (+32.9% Y/Y). It will be an interesting experiment to see if DIS is punished by the robots on falling earnings, even with the explanation that this is due to investing in the future. I may actually long a well out-of-the-money PUT on DIS. I am not critical of DIS or its desire to invest in the future. I fully endorse the streaming strategy. I am only concerned about the stupid robots that are run by rocket scientists that set up back-test macro-trading patterns. Pattern 1 right now is to short sell lower profit results, and DIS could be sold tomorrow.I checked the premium on the Put options for AAPL, I took two contracts for under $400. I think that if you are long AAPL, you should take a very small position in a low-cost Put for AAPL. If you have 300-400 shares, buying two contracts with a 129 strike price for under $200 each is a small price to pay to insure your principal. You could look into writing calls as I suggested in the previous paragraph to generate funds to pay for the ""insurance""."

A lot of them were about the valuation of the stock.Traditional ratios such as P/E or P/B shouldn't be applied to Square since it is still in high-growth modus.The OCF shows Square might have a CAGR of 28% over the next years.The 10-year forward P/E and the virtual PEG, my own valuation methods, also show that Square is at least fairly valued, as one of the few high-growth stocks in this market.","I don't have the habit of writing too many articles about the same stock over a short period of time. If you are a long-term investor, nothing much changes over the course of a week. But while an article that I wrote about Square (SQ) was only published last week, I felt the urge to write another article about the same stock. The reason is my wonderful readers.(Source)If you have read any article of my hand before (thanks!), you will know that I always interact a lot with my readers in the comment section. I feel as if it's equally important as the article itself. Readers point out mistakes (not too often, I hope), ask critical questions (I love them) or have a completely opposite point of view. When I write, I feel as if the readers and I learn alongside each other. After all, by organizing my thoughts into a text, the pros and cons of a certain investment become clearer to me too.After my last article about Square, there were some very interesting comments and questions again. Most were about the valuation of Square. Therefore, I decided to write another article in which this is the main point.To say the least, Square's valuation ignites heated debates between bulls and bears. The bears call it grossly overvalued or something of that sort. Bulls call it seriously undervalued and try to convince others that it is extremely cheap.One of the reasons for this debate is the fact that everybody looks at different metrics. Of course, on paper, with traditional metrics, Square looks very expensive. It has a negative ttm P/E ratio and a forward P/E of 55, according to finviz.com. A P/S ratio of 6.87 is not extremely cheap as well, although it looks better than the double-digit P/S ratios of SaaS companies and the P/S of 17.66 for Mastercard (MA) and 17.36 for Visa (V), for example. There will also be investors who point to the high P/B ratio of 22.5.But there are numerous other valuation methods. A conservative one is future cash flow. Simplywall.st shows Square as about fairly valued using its future cash flow:I have already talked about the operating cash flow in my last article about Square. I already showed this graph:Data by YChartsIt shows that Square's operating cash flow has reaccelerated. But I wanted to show you this FAST graph too:For those reading this on a small screen: the OCF is expected to grow by 50.5% over the five years. To make sure you understand this completely: the growth numbers until 2022 (63%, 28% and 26%) are the estimates of the analysts. I have added numbers that slow down (23% and 21%). This graph shows a potential return of 255% based on OCF or a CAGR of 27.58%. If you think this is impossible (and I know some bears will), this is the graph of Amazon (AMZN) over the last 10 years:You can see that the stock price (the black line) follows the growth on the orange line almost precisely.This is Visa's chart:Again you see that the stock price follows OCF.We could go on and on, but I think you get the point. Again, here too, OCF is not perfect. But it gives an indication that Square is not that overvalued as some claim. To the contrary.For growth stocks, I also like to use my own methods, though: the 10-year forward P/E and the virtual PEG. I first introduced the concept for a valuation of Shopify (SHOP) at $141. Everyone was shouting back then that the stock was overvalued, but in my analysis, I showed that the stock was just fairly priced or even undervalued. If you look at the stock price since that valuation, less than a year ago, you see that the market seemed to agree:Data by YChartsLast month, I took the same criteria, the 10-year forward P/E and the virtual PEG to assess Shopify again. I came to the conclusion that it was overvalued then. I don't believe in the accuracy of any valuation method, but the 10-year forward P/E and the virtual PEG at least give you an idea. I don't mind if there is some overvaluation, but when it becomes extreme, I trim my position. I almost never sell completely, since I could be wrong. You never know for sure what the market will do.Let's do the exercise with the 10-year forward P/E and the virtual PEG for Square.Square's revenue is projected to be $6.82B by 2024. With the great results from Cash App, I think this is rather conservative, but let's keep the number. For 10 years, you have to have five more years of revenue growth, of course. Let's assume in those years, Square's revenue grows by 20%.That would come in at $16.97B in revenue. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), a company somewhat similar to Square, but much more mature, has a gross margin of 45% and a profit margin of 15.40%. Let's assume that in a decade's time, Square has the same profit margin of 15.40% on its revenue (which is conservative too, imo). That would mean $2.61B in profits. There are 430M shares outstanding right now. Let's assume a dilution of 25%. Then there would be 537.5M shares outstanding. If we divide $2.61B by 537.5M, we get an EPS of $4.86. With a stock price of $60.38 (at the moment of writing), we get a 10-year forward P/E of 60.38/4.86, which equals 12.42. This is not expensive, although it might seem so. Just for the sake of comparison, these are the 10-year forward P/Es of some other well-known companies:(Compiled by the author)So this valuation too suggests that Square is fairly valued or slightly undervalued. Again, this is no precise math, but people who are shouting that Square is overvalued just look at the wrong metrics, in my opinion. As I stated in my last article about Square, operational cash flow or OCF is a better metric to value growth stocks. That OCF showed that Square's valuation was not out of whack and the 10-year forward P/E valuation just seems to confirm that. We'll look at the virtual PEG of Square to see if that also confirms that the current price reflects Square's fair value.For the virtual PEG, we take the final net profit margin and apply it to the revenue projection of 2020. In Square's case that is 15.4% applied to $3.033B. That would add up to $467M in profits. With the current 413M shares, that would be EPS of $1.13. With a stock price of $60.30, this would mean a P/E ratio of 53.36. With an expected EPS growth of 44.6% for the next five years, this comes down to a 'virtual PEG' of 1.19. Again, this shows that Square is fairly valued or slightly undervalued.It's always easy to shout that a certain stock is overvalued or undervalued. But it's important to look at the right numbers and evaluate a growth stock, which grows at an incredible pace, with criteria suitable for growth stocks, not for value stocks. I have shown that my PEG5 system works very well for the mature, stable stocks of the Dow Jones. But it wouldn't work for Square or other high-growth companies. Besides the OCF, you can also use my 10-year forward P/E and virtual PEG systems and you come to the same conclusion each time: Square is more or less fairly valued. In this heated market, it is one of the few hyper-growth stocks that are fairly valued.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from a long-term perspective, feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!P.S.

4296775,100666,2019-10-16T09:34:33-04:00,"Valuing Square on free cash flow makes no sense to me.A fall in the share price doesn't mean anything for the fundamentals of a company. Great investors prefer long holding periods. Patience is the differentiator.There are lots of ratios and numbers. To decide which one to use depends on the kind of stock.For high-growth stocks such as Square, operating cash flow is probably one of the best metrics, because it shows you how the company brings in cash without the reinvestments.","On this wonderful platform called Seeking Alpha, there is room for lots of opinions, and that makes it very versatile. I am a firm believer that opposite views balance each other out, and mostly the blend lands somewhere near reality. But sometimes readers read several opinions and get confused, of course.An example could be investors in Square (SQ), who might be confused after reading an article by Michael Wiggins De Oliveira, who came out with a piece that says that investing in this company is just living on hope. In this short article (and his other articles on the company), he looks at Square's free cash flow and concludes that the stock is overvalued. My opinion is that this is not the best metric to value a growth company like Square, though. In this article, I want to present the opposing case for Square and the metric that I see as much more suited for Square's valuation. (Source)At the moment of writing (on Tuesday, after the market closed) Square share price is at $64.29, while its all-time high, which was reached in September 2018, is 36.85% higher at $101.15.Data by YChartsThat means the stock will have to rise 58% to get back to its all-time high. About half a year ago, I picked Square as a Potential Multibagger. Since then, it hasn't really done well either:Data by YChartsAs you can see, it lags the S&P 500 (SPY) by 22%. I don't care too much, though. I have a cost base that allows me to be still in the green, and I'm holding tight to my shares. I'm a long-term investor, and although a lot of people claim to be long-term oriented, many investors sell their shares too often and too soon. And I have added to my shares recently, so if I wouldn't have a position, I'd start one now.(From the author's Twitter feed)I'm a fan of long-term investors such as Buffett and Lynch. There are numerous Buffettisms about long-term holding periods (you know the one with ""forever"", for example), but this time I think Lynch might be of more use.(Peter Lynch; Image source)Here's the first quote of his milestone book One Up On Wall Street, which I highly recommend if you haven't read it:Patience is the big differentiator between investors, in my opinion. People who don't follow the herd, who don't run up and down with sentiment, don't think that every price change says something fundamentally about a company - those are the ones who end up with big gains.As for Square, nothing has changed fundamentally. The company has become even better, working on the introduction of stock trades to its Cash App platform. Cash App is the consumer ecosystem that Square is building out at an incredible speed. The ecosystem generated $260 million in the last quarter, already more than $1 billion on an annual basis, and that in just three years after the app was launched. So, what would be wrong with Square, the company? The valuation was probably a bit stretched in 2018, and now the price takes a breather to allow the company to grow into its valuation.If I invest in a company, I always try to picture it and its products in a decade's time. Will the company be around and thriving? Are there big trends that give the products a tailwind? Are the products ready to become much bigger than they are now? For Square, I don't see any reason why there would be a negative answer to one of these questions. The valuation of the stock will, eventually, always follow the success of a company and its products.And a second quote by Peter Lynch, again from One Up On Wall Street, can be applied to this situation too:(Image source)It takes years to have great results, and again, it's patience that does the trick here. Lots of pundits will want you out of a stock that underperforms, but there is no reason to do so unless you see the fundamentals of the company deteriorate. Just be patient - for years, not months. If you have been patient for years, I'm sure you are already a happy shareholder of Square:Data by YChartsIf you bought shares at the wrong moment, at the peak, that's just one year ago, not three or four. Just be patient.Square is clearly a growth stock. You can see that from its growth in revenue, stock price and high multiples: a negative TTM P/E, a forward P/E of 58, P/S of 7 and a P/B of 23.If you just look at this, you will have a hard time valuing Square. But you should also take into account other numbers. Its sales growth in the past 5 years: 43% yearly, on average. EPS in the past 5 years: average yearly growth of 21%. Sales QoQ: 44% growth. And, not to be forgotten, EPS growth projections for the next 5 years: 45%.What is the best metric to look at? All of them combined, of course. Not one in isolation. Some make more sense than others, depending on the kind of stock that you look at. Free cash flow doesn't make much sense for a company reinvesting all of its money into its own business.One of the best numbers to look at for growth stocks is the operating cash flow, or OCF. That's the same as cash from operations, or CFO.Data by YChartsAs you can see, Square's OCF is still growing like weeds and has actually accelerated over the last year.Do you want another example of a growth stock that follows its cash from operations? I'll give you three: Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB):Data by YChartsData by YChartsData by YChartsIt's also one of the reasons I'm not that fond of Netflix (NFLX), as I have already written before:Data by YChartsThe reason why CFO (or OCF) is such a good metric is that it shows the money a company brings in from its business, stripped from investments, just the core business. Because growth companies want to grow their revenue as soon as possible and scale, they reinvest most of the money they earn back into the business. That means almost no free cash flow is left, and therefore, free cash flow is not a good metric if you want to value high-growth stocks. The best metric here is cash from operations. You would have caught Amazon early if you looked at it, even though everybody and his little sister was screaming that the company was overvalued.Square is still a company that fires on all cylinders, although the stock hasn't being doing so. This change in sentiment can be overcome by patience and a realization that great investors held for the long term too, even if their positions were down substantially.There are always a lot of metrics and numbers to value a stock and a company, but judging a high-growth stock with free cash flow is fundamentally flawed because the company reinvests almost all of its money back into growth initiatives. The operating cash flow (i.e., cash from operations) shows how the company behind the growth stock is doing fundamentally apart from the investments, and therefore, it often gives you a better idea of how a high-growth company is performing.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from a long-term perspective, feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!P.S.

Saying that, last month I noted:In this article, rather than question Square's potential, sustainable growth rates, I bring into the light exactly what investors are paying for.Why investors should avoid Square:The mobile payment company came out of the gates with an incredibly strong vision - led by an impressive founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey. Square was incredibly savvy to find a way to break into an industry that was practically begging to be disrupted - and disrupt Square did!Anecdotally, I suspect that many shareholders subconsciously theorize that Twitter (TWTR), which at one point was heavily cash-burning and succeeded in inflecting its substantial losses into strong gains, and that Square may do the same. I fail to see why that will be the case. Why? Because Square's competitive advantages are small in comparison with those of Twitter.The reason why investors were more than happy to pay up north of the $25 billion market cap for Square predominantly comes down to the fact that this most entrepreneurial management team built a highly cohesive seller ecosystem.Then, rather than resting on their laurels, within a few years they developed a very different platform, Square's Cash App, with a focus on individuals rather than sellers looking to manage and grow their own business.Looking back, we see that if a few years ago Square had any first-mover advantage, currently, the sector is littered with all kinds of offerings from numerous peers substantially offering the same.Furthermore, it should be noted that Square's main customer base, entrepreneurs are the most price-sensitive when it comes to choosing their own point-of-sale system.On the other hand, investing is rarely black or white. The market, I believe, was mostly correct that Square has tremendous underlying value. On the other hand, my contention is whether paying up $25 billion for Square today leaves investors with any upside potential? Let's dig further.While Square's share continues to steadily rise, shareholders are very content with management's adjusted EBITDA proclamations. But once Square has a slightly lackluster quarter, with a weaker-than-expected outlook, shareholders will immediately start to question whether they made the correct decision to invest in Square.Source: Author's calculationsIn the table above I have taken Square's reported cash flows from operations, and backed out stock-based compensation and capex (including intangibles - although intangibles were immaterial).Do we count Square's regular acquisitions as a recurring cost? Most investors would argue that we should not include them, particularly if they are not large. Having said that Square bought Weebly for approximately $365 million. Is that significant given that Square is valued at north of $25 billion? What about when we consider the fact that Square's 'clean' free cash is only close to break-even?For now, Square's balance sheet which has a net debt position of just $600 million, which means that Square's management team have plenty of time to prove to bearish investors (such as myself) that it has what it takes to remain relevant in an overcrowded space.However, personally, I fail to see how paying up close to 7x sales for a company which is not likely to generate strong free cash flows for a considerable amount of time makes for any sort of bargain investment opportunity.Dorsey himself acknowledges that as Square laps its acquisitions of Zesty and Weebly, as well as the pricing change on Cash App, Square's near-term revenues growth rates will become challenging hurdles to overcome.Is it worthwhile paying 7x sales on the 'hope' that Square will remain one of the dominant players in the mobile payment space? I argue that it is not and that Square's stock is avoided.On the 6th of November after hours, Square will release its Q3 2019 results. Stay tuned!"
4296576,105417,2019-10-15T08:38:40-04:00,"Digital and mobile penetration is one of the strongest secular growth trends for Square.Developing markets are key to Square's expansion, particularly in Latin America.Attractive pricing remains key to Square's competitive advantage.","Square, Inc. is a financial services company that focuses on software and hardware payments products. Square Register allows merchants to accept offline debit and credit cards on both smart-phones and tablet computers. Merchants enter card details through the Square Reader, which plugs into the supported smart-phone/tablet and reads the magnetic stripe.We see Square as uniquely positioned to take advantage of several major developments in the evolution of point-of-sale (POS) transactions and, indeed, the payments world as a whole over the last decade. The company stands at the forefront of payment processing, adopting and integrating recent trends. At the same time, Square’s products cater to a wide variety of merchants, from retail stores to restaurants to cabs, particularly smaller businesses – those that are often overlooked by Square’s established competitors in the terminals space, such as VeriFone and Ingenico.When we compare Square against its peers in the payments industry, such as VeriFone and Ingenico, as well as other players, such as GPN, ADS, V, and MA, among others, we find that the company merits a revenue multiple of 6.4x on 2020 revenue, which would result in the target price of $74.We see Square as uniquely positioned to take advantage of several major developments in the evolution of POS transactions and, indeed, the payments world as a whole over the last decade. The company stands at the forefront of payment processing, adopting and integrating recent trends. At the same time, Square’s products cater to a wide variety of merchants, from retail stores to restaurants to cabs, particularly smaller businesses – those that are often overlooked by Square’s established competitors in the terminals space, such as VeriFone and Ingenico.Digital and Mobile Penetration: According to industry analyses, approximately 21 MM out of 30 MM businesses in the United States do not accept credit cards. We recognize that many of these businesses may 1) operate online and hence may leverage other types of payment platforms, such as PayPal (albeit many of PayPal’s transactions also utilize credit cards); 2) process large ticket sizes ($1,000+), which makes check payments more attractive than credit card payments, given 3-4% in average MDR that businesses face; or, conversely 3) process small ticket sizes (under $5), where quick cash payments may be faster and more convenient. Yet, we estimate that at least 10% of the remaining non-card businesses are likely to convert to POS processing over the next 12-24 months, which represents approximately ~2 MM businesses, or ~4 MM prospective terminals. We see these terminals as a meaningful addressable market for Square. Card payments are expanding in tandem with the growth of mobile products, with contactless authentication solutions, such as Android Pay and Apple Pay, increasingly gaining traction. We note that there are currently at least 550-620 MM mobile devices in the United States, with the total volume likely to reach ~1,100 MM devices by 2020.Developing Markets Hold the Cards: With developing markets catching up to the G-20 economies in cash-to-plastic conversion, we expect payments volume and transaction growth rates to be the highest in the emerging markets, particularly given the growth from a low base. According to the 2019 Nilson data, purchase transactions in Latin America are expected to grow 13% during the 2019-2022 period, while in the Middle East & Africa and Asia Pacific regions they are estimated to grow by 16% and 19%, respectively. In contrast, growth is more subdued, yet still respectable, in Europe and the US during the same time period, at 6% and 9%, respectively. (Given that Eastern Europe has a higher card transaction momentum than the western region, we believe that traction in Western Europe may actually be somewhat weaker). Overall, we expect developing countries to meaningfully contribute to the growth in POS terminal products and solutions. These trends illustrate the importance of the international strategy for Square, where the company has little penetration at present. Several exceptions aside, the highest concentration of POS devices is in the developed countries, with Austria, Australia, New Zealand, and Greece leading the list of top 15 countries. While we do not expect developing markets to penetrate the top 15 cohort in the near future, we believe that mobile tailwinds, mainly the rise of smart-phones, in the emerging economies should generate demand not only for plastic-enabled terminals, but also for NFC-enabled terminals capable of processing payments via smartphones. In some developing markets, particularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe, many customers choose to avoid card usage altogether, opting instead to conduct many financial activities via their phoneAttractive Pricing: Square charges merchants a payment processing fee of 2.40%-2.75% on gross purchase volume (GPV), which is meaningfully below the merchant discount rate (MDR) of 3-4% that merchants frequently pay on non-Square transactions. In addition, the company charges a 2.5%-3.5% fee and $0.15 per transaction fee for manually entered card-not-present transactions (where the incidence of fraud may be substantially greater). We note that about 63% of transactions are card-present and approximately 27% are CNP. We view this pricing structure, particularly for card-present transactions, as key to Square’s value proposition, since a lot of merchants have reservations about the rising MDR, especially for more expensive American Express transactions, as well as about the overall complexity of charges, since in addition to the MDR they often face incremental processing costs, such as batch fees and charge-backs.Convenient Processing / Analytics: Square’s payments and POS services channel both hardware and software to enable payments acceptance. The Square Register product (a POS application) links into the mobile device, such as iPhone or iPad, to process the transaction. Square Analytics and Invoices allow merchants to study the back end and manage daily operations. Square acts as a merchant of record for sellers, handling complex systems and rules, and assuming the risk of charge-backs and refunds.We see the following risks to our thesis.1. Competitive Pressures:Square’s success could lead to entrance of new players, who would eat away a portion of the company’s market share2. Pricing Wars:We believe that SQ may more pricing headwinds from VeriFone and, to a lesser extent, Ingenico. Square already offers one of the lowest-priced products in this space; however, other companies are aggressively catching up.3. Economic Slowdown:As economy gradually softens in the United States, Europe, and China, we may see fewer lower payments volume, but, even more importantly, we may see fewer new merchants joining Square’s platform.4. Rise of Alternative Payment Solutions:With the payments space rapidly developing, we believe that a rise of various alternative solutions, particularly on the mobile side, possesses a significant threat to Square. Merchants are increasingly looking for an opportunity to save on the discount rate, which should foster more research in that direction and thus pose a meaningful threat to Square."
4293642,104761,2019-09-26T07:54:07-04:00,"Square has expanded its payment processing ecosystem with several new service offerings in recent years, but that innovation appears to be slowing.Though the company has expanded its service offerings through acquisitions as well, Square's continual emphasis on innovation has continued to drive investor optimism and an extreme valuation multiple.Innovation to benefit business clients appears to have slowed this year, though the company is testing stock trading in its consumer Cash App.Despite the recent selloff, Square still looks stretched in valuation. The departure of highly involved CFO Sarah Friar last year leaves one to wonder how much was lost.CEO Jack Dorsey (also CEO of Twitter) should pick a horse.","When the year began, it felt like Square (SQ) was on a continual innovation binge. It had added its free debit card for businesses in January, making the Square payment platform and services ecosystem even more indispensable to small business clients.But that innovation appears to have slowed. Square still looks like a compelling long-term bet given its track record of growth in recent years, but transaction revenue growth is rapidly decelerating and the company has decided to boost investing to find new avenues to grow service revenue and expand the company's ecosystem.The recent selloff, I believe, reflects the increasing uncertainty around future revenue growth drivers outside of Cash App, and uncertainty about the company's direction following departure last year of Sarah Friar, CFO since 2012.With the departure of Friar, we're left with a company helmed by a CEO--Jack Dorsey--who is also the CEO of Twitter (TWTR). Given the recent turnaround at Twitter, it would be nice to see Dorsey exit Twitter and focus his efforts exclusively on Square to ensure the company can fulfill the promise created with the help of Friar.Square's mission has been to continually develop a moat of technology and services for clients that makes it increasingly likely that once Square obtains a business client, or a consumer client, that client never leaves.Square started in 2009 as a payment processing vendor that would help merchants accept credit card payments anywhere at any time. Many of us first noticed Square in person when we got our hair cut or shopped at a farmers' market and watched as the business owner swiped our card through a square-shaped reader that was plugged into their iPhone or iPad.SourceSarah Friar, the CFO who left in 2018, was hired in 2012. When Dorsey hired her, he told he needed her to be the best CFO in the world. It has been argued that because Dorsey has served as the CEO of both Square and Twitter simultaneously, Friar's role as Square CFO often felt like it bled into the CEO role. Note a comment last year from a Wall Street analyst about the topic:When Square went public in 2015, 95% of revenue was from payments. The revenue mix since then has diversified as the company has developed services to complement transaction processing.As of Q2-19, just 66% of revenue is from payments as the company has expanded beyond payment processing with new service offerings designed to help businesses do business better.Square has been developing an ecosystem that makes it increasingly likely that once merchants are on board with Square, they never leave. The company's strategy to this point is to build out three different markets: retail, restaurants, and services.SourceIn retail, Square began with payment processing. Then Square analyzed the ecosystem of its retail customers in order to find ways to more fully integrate Square into the operations of its customers. Square is attempting to ease the administrative burden of running a small business by making Square services easy to use and indispensable to that business.If you run a boutique clothing store today, Square doesn't just want to process your credit card transactions. It also wants to manage your payroll, administer benefits to your staff, give you the tools to build a website easily, provide you with simple low-fee access to small business loans, and enable you to offer installment payments to shoppers like the big boy stores. The company also recently launched a larger, stand-alone credit card reader in case you don't want to use your personal iPad or iPhone to process credit card transactions.The company through 2018 and into early 2019 made several new product announcements that built upon the Square value proposition to business clients. This is what was impressive--the frequent rollout of new products and services to embolden the ecosystem.But announcements around new innovations have slowed this year. There has not been a substantial introduction of innovation for businesses in six months. And the company recently sold its Caviar food delivery service, which was one of the many services it offered to restaurant clients as part of its service value proposition.Prior to Friar's departure, the Square ecosystem moved beyond seller and also incorporated the consumer with the Cash App, a payment app that has become a success and its monthly downloads now outpace the popular Venmo app owned by PayPal (PYPL).Unlike Venmo, the Cash App supports (free) Bitcoin trading. And the company is also testing stock trading in the Cash App, and this could drive consumer engagement and revenue growth, but this remains to be seen. And as it stands now, Cash App is still just a nominal contributor to revenue at $135 million of the >$1.1 billion of revenue in the recent quarter.Of the need for innovation, Dorsey recently noted on the Q2-19 call that the company needs ""more focus and more investment."" In fact, ""tightening"" focus and ""improving"" focus seemed to be a pretty strong theme of the recent earnings call.While Dorsey has given no indication he plans to stop serving as CEO of two companies at once, maybe the thought is starting to cross his mind. Twitter is a toxic media dump that requires full attention itself. How Dorsey deals with the headaches of both businesses and gets enough sleep is beyond me.Square is not profitable. And with Dorsey's recent announcement that the company will boost spending to improve innovation, profitability will likely continue to take a back seat to innovation and revenue growth.Because it operates at a loss, the company consistently touts its EBITDA numbers, and the company narrowly beat its own revised upward guidance $250-255 million for 2018. The company expects EBITDA to rise to $405-415 million in 2019 and as of this writing trades at forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 59, which is off markedly higher multiples earlier this year. But the current multiple is still pretty high compared to payment companies like Visa (NYSE:V) and PayPal.But, of course, Square is building something that is more than just a payments company and the market runway ahead is massive. But the company is still primarily a transactions processor and transaction revenue growth rates continue to decelerate. Square may be approaching a more reasonable valuation in the low $50s compared to earlier this year, but the future value of the company is largely contingent on the innovations Dorsey, absent Friar, can drive moving forward. And it remains to be seen if new innovations will be as beneficial to the company as others to date.In short, the future is uncertain. Dorsey should consider committing to Square fully to reduce that uncertainty.Square may still be in the early innings of what could be a very long growth story. Given the recent reset with the Caviar sale and the company's devotion to more ""focus"" and innovation, it would be nice to see Dorsey exit Twitter and commit himself exclusively to Square to help the company reach the potential he has often touted."
4291924,69905,2019-09-16T20:43:59-04:00,"Great company, with a lot of potential.But its valuation leaves investors with no margin of safety.Ultimately, shares are best avoided.","Square (SQ) is a terrific company with huge underlying potential. However, it appears that its growth rate is starting to slow down, at which point valuation might start to become more pertinent.In this article, I note positive dynamics, as well as highlighting its strong financial position, while questioning its profitability. On balance, I declare that shareholders are best to avoid these shares.Square is an impressive company led by a terrific CEO, Jack Dorsey, who manages not one public company but two. Over the past few years, Square was seen as one company which could do no wrong.Having said that, last year, I wrote two articles (here and here) where I declared that investors were overpaying for the stock. Since those articles were published, approximately twelve months back, its share price has fallen by more than 30%.To be clear, I never shorted the stock, as I believed very much that Dorsey and his team are highly capable and would not put it past them to think up new and diverse revenue streams. Admittedly, despite my contrarian stance at the time, I know that as rule one should never short on valuation alone - that doesn't make for a compelling enough short thesis.But I hypothesized then, and we can see reinforced now (below), that Square is slowing down its adjusted EBITDA rates at an alarming pace.Source: author's calculationsAt this juncture, investors need to be realistic and consider that although last year's adjusted EBITDA growth rate of 85% is impressive, this year, it's guided to slow down to 60%.Then, what does Square's adjusted EBITDA growth rate look like next year? Because investors will offer a multiple based off of what they assume, Square's sustainable growth rate is likely to tail off at in the medium term.If Square can continue to post north of 40% growth rates, that's certainly impressive, and shareholders will continue to find Square to be a rewarding investment. While on the other hand, if Square's growth rates were to slow down to approximately mid-20s%, that's a whole different story for shareholders.One strong positive which Square has going for it is its strong balance sheet which offers Square ample flexibility.In more detail, Square has close to $1.7 billion of debt (2022 notes and 2023 notes), but Square also carries approximately $1.2 billion of cash and equivalents. Consequently, it has a lot of dry powder built into the company, allowing it to weather many executional mishaps.Investors should go further than recognizing a great investment. They need to have a variant perspective, which is not already priced into the investment.Thus, as the table below demonstrates, it is incredibly challenging to contend that investors are getting the necessary margin of safety in Square, at present.Source: author's calculationsFor example, note that while I highlight Square's P/Cash flow from operation metric at just over 60x, readers should remember the fact that this multiple does not account for Square's regular capitalization of costs, not to mention its capex requirements.What's more, Square, like many asset-light fintech companies, has the bulk of its cost paid to its management as stock-based compensation. If one were to consider these costs as a real-cash cost, this multiple would come out substantially worse.In the market, it is not good enough to be right when everyone else is right, too. Investors need to be right when the crowd is wrong.The mobile payments firm certainly has a lot going for it. My sole argument is that a great company does not always make for a great investment at the wrong valuation.For now, investors are better off to sidestep this investment and wait for a safer entry point to prevail.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."
4301640,69965,2019-11-01T17:18:03-04:00,"Square is winning bigger business deals and these businesses are growing fast. Focusing on just the top line without context is a short-term mistake.Square Cash allows people to pay other individuals, buy and sell Bitcoin and now stocks, what's next could be a threat to traditional banking.You have to read 42 pages to get to the good stuff sometimes. Square's last earnings report revealed somewhat surprising cash flow data.","For the last few months, Square's (NYSE: SQ) stock has exhibited a phrase that Peter Lynch coined as the EKG of a rock. Lynch used this term describing companies that previously were either rising or falling fast and then they seem to hit a plateau. When bottom fishing, he preferred to let the falling knife stick and wobble around before trying to grab it. Since the end of July, the shares have languished, while investors and analysts, try to digest revised guidance for the third quarter. The good news is there are several reasons to buy the shares, prior to Square's upcoming earnings. The company's seller ecosystem carries hidden growth, Square Cash could disrupt traditional banking and positive cash flow is on the horizon.I'm not sure why Square's guidance last quarter was met with such frustration. After Square's earnings release, one article summed up the problem:While many focused on the company's adjusted outlook for the third quarter, I would draw investors attention to the last sentence. ""The company kept constant its adjusted revenue and EPS forecast for the full year."" In other words, investors bid up Square to around $80 a share, based on certain revenue, EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS projections for the full year. If we eliminate the noise around the third quarter, investors then decided the same company, with the same full-year projections, was worth roughly $60-ish per share.If this situation doesn't explain the folly of short-term trading, I don't know what does. In the meantime, analysts have actually increased Square's annual EPS estimate for this year slightly. When short-term reactions don't match up to the fundamentals, investors have an opportunity.The first reason Square offers investors another opportunity to buy the stock, is connected to the growth of its seller ecosystem. Square got its start offering credit card acceptance primarily by targeting smaller sellers. Having worked in the merchant services industry in the past, I can tell you firsthand, most larger firms don't really want small sellers. Many large merchant processors rely on commission-based salespeople roaming the countryside trying to sign up new businesses to their system.When given the choice of talking to a company that represents a $5,000 payday, versus one that represents a $500 payday, salespeople are understandably motivated to focus on bigger deals. Square on the other hand, has moved from advertising and having small-sellers self-onboard, to offering a process to allow larger sellers to self-onboard as well.(Source: Square Up)Square seems to understand what business owners really want is a good deal along with simplicity. This is again a situation where the loudly reported facts ignore some fundamental strength. The loud facts suggest that Square's transaction-based revenue growth is slowing. In the last quarter, total revenue of this type increased by 24% annually, which was slower than several prior quarters. What is being overlooked, is the percentage of larger sellers (gross payment volume GPV of $125,000+) is growing inside of Square's ecosystem.In 2016, larger sellers made up 42% of transaction-based revenue. By 2017, the number moved up to 46% and last year, Square's larger sellers hit the 50% threshold. In the company's last earnings report, larger sellers made up 53% of volume.We already saw that overall transaction-based revenue increased by 24% year-over-year. Inside of this number, larger seller's GPV increased by 50% annually. The point is, as Square continues to earn larger deals, these faster growing sellers should help the company's transaction-based revenue growth rate. Investors who are focused on the apparent slowdown may not see this inflection point coming.The overall business market also argues well for Square's future. According to Business Insider (BI), E-commerce could exceed $1 trillion by 2023. Square's Weebly acquisition helps the company market website solutions with its payment options built in. In addition, BI says, ""Mobile in-store payments are huge in developing markets, but approaching an inflection point in developed regions."" Square's card reader, and the Square terminal, seem to fit the bill nicely. Once the company makes an earnest push overseas, its mobility first mindset should be a differentiating factor.The second reason Square is offering investors another chance, is the company's Square Cash business is evolving. Looking at the broader market, Grandview Research said that ""the global real-time payments industry was valued at $6.9 billion in 2018 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 29.3% from 2019 to 2025.""(Source: Grandview Research - Real Time Payments Market)Though person to business transactions are expected to keep the lion's share of the market, person-to-person payments are expected to roughly double in size over the next several years. Some have said, ""the ubiquity of mobile P2P services like Venmo and Square Cash will propel digital P2P to $574 billion by 2023."" However, Square Cash isn't just about paying individuals for goods or services.While some will argue real value of Bitcoin, Square seems firmly committed to helping the crypto-currency find a mainstream backing. In the company's last quarter, Bitcoin revenue of $125.1 million represented growth of more than 230% year-over-year. Bitcoin is admittedly a terrible margin business (1.7% gross margin last quarter), however this is just the beginning.Square recently announced it would start allowing customers to buy and sell stocks through the Cash App with no commission. I begin to wonder how far Square Cash can spread its wings. Users are already paying each other through the app. They can now buy Bitcoin and stocks. The company already offers the Cash Card, which is a debit card tied to the Cash App balance.(Source: Cash App Press)The company's Cash Card offers to reimburse ATM fees, ""for accounts that receive at least one direct deposit of $50 or more per month."" Offering to reimburse ATM fees, in exchange for a direct deposit sounds very bank-like to me. One of the few things missing from this being a truly one-stop shop is bill pay.While almost everyone takes debit cards with the Visa logo, there are some instances where an electronic payment or physical check might be needed. Square doesn't currently offer this as an easy option, yet there is little to discourage the company from either creating the offering in-house, acquiring a payments company, or striking a partnership on bill pay. For example, PayPal early this year, announced a strategic partnership with Paymentus, with plans to add bill pay to the PayPal system.The bottom line is the Cash App is only missing a few pieces from being a solid banking alternative. Square's management teased some new options coming to the Cash App several times in the last conference call. Expanding the Cash App into new usage scenarios, is another avenue for future growth.The third reason Square is giving investors another opportunity, has to do with the company's road toward positive free cash flow. It's no secret that Square has been reinvesting its gross profits into growing the business. For those who are less familiar, that's management speak for we are losing money, but we expect if we grow big enough, we can make money.Many investors might look at Square's six-month cash flow statement and see negative numbers and stop there. In the six-month period last year, Square's core operating cash flow (net income + depreciation and amortization) was negative $7.4 million. In this year's equivalent quarter, the company generated a negative $7.14 million. In short, Square lost about 3.5% less money in the last six months than last year. While this is improvement, it's hardly something to get excited about.However, I don't stop reading earnings reports until I get to the end. There was a little tidbit of information on page 42 of Square's 10-Q that caught my eye. In the EBITDA reconciliation table, under the three months ended June 30, 2019, it shows Square posted a net loss of $6.7 million in net income. In this same timeframe, the company recorded $18.8 million in depreciation and amortization expenses. Since the latter is an accounting allowance to help with taxes, it doesn't represent a payment of cash. If we add depreciation and amortization back into the company's net loss, we get a positive $12.1 million. This would seem to be good news, as it shows Square can generate positive operating cash flow.In addition, comparing this year, to last year's quarter, the company's core operating cash flow increased by 88%. The short version is Square is finally starting to see the benefit of scale that it keeps promising.There is a second piece to the cash flow story as well. The company's SG&A spending as a percentage of revenue is slowly but surely gaining leverage. In the same quarter in 2017, SG&A came in at 22.3% of revenue. Last year, SG&A improved slightly to 22.2% of revenue. In the company's last quarter, SG&A improved further to 21.9% of revenue. Theoretically, as a company reaches scale, the cost to build the business grow incrementally smaller.Though a small dollar improvement in operating cash flow doesn't seem like a big deal, better SG&A leverage suggests better cash flow in the future if the trend continues. Given that Square's cash flow statements have been a hot button for investors, any sign of improvement is a big deal.Square is the same company, with the same full-year outlook, yet the stock is 20% cheaper than before the company's last earnings report. It's possible some investors are worried that Square won't be able to make up in the 4th quarter, what it talked down for the third quarter. However, this makes little sense.Square heavily relies on transaction revenue and many of these businesses have some of their most significant sales in the fourth quarter. The company is spending now, to win more business in this all-important quarter. For a payment processor, that's exactly the right move. While some have worried about the sale of Caviar being a negative, the company said, ""Caviar has a lower gross margin profile than the remainder of our revenue streams related to subscription and services."" Just to put that into context, Square's overall gross margin was less than 40%. This segment of the company grew by 87% year-over-year with a 76% gross margin.We've seen Square's cash flow statement is improving, and it is successfully going after faster growing, and larger businesses. If selling Caviar allows Square to focus better on winning these larger and profitable relationships, I'm all for it. With the shares trading at a significant discount to where they have been most of the year, and no change to the end of year projected results, investors should thank short-term traders for the opportunity."
4292651,105417,2019-09-20T07:36:39-04:00,"We see SQ as a solid story with multiple industry tailwinds, such as EMV and continued cash-to-plastic conversion.Convenient processing and analytics remains key to Square's popularity.Our valuation supports at least 25% upside from the current levels.","Square, Inc. is a financial services company that focuses on software and hardware payments products. Square Register allows merchants to accept offline debit and credit cards on both smart-phones and tablet computers. Merchants enter card details through the Square Reader, which plugs into the supported smart-phone/tablet and reads the magnetic stripe.We see Square as uniquely positioned to take advantage of several major developments in the evolution of point-of-sale (POS) transactions and, indeed, the payments world as a whole over the last decade. The company stands at the forefront of payment processing, adopting and integrating recent trends. At the same time, Square’s products cater to a wide variety of merchants, from retail stores to restaurants to cabs, particularly smaller businesses – those that are often overlooked by Square’s established competitors in the terminals space, such as VeriFone and Ingenico.When we compare Square against its peers in the payments industry, such as VeriFone and Ingenico, as well as other players, such as GPN, ADS, V, and MA, among others, we find that the company merits a revenue multiple of 6.3x on 2020 revenue, which would result in the target price of $74.1. Strong Total Addressable Market: For Square, both the growth of card products and the penetration of mobile solutions signal the rising demand for innovative terminalization, as existing and new merchants increasingly require not only new hardware (both EMV and NFC-enabled), but also software to 1) accept payments; 2) process business analytics; and 3) streamline operations. The Square Register app combines with Square’s hardware to enable mobile device as a POS terminal, making the transaction process quicker and simpler for buyers and merchants. The Square Analytics and Invoices meaningfully facilitate the back-end for merchants, alleviating operational burdens, such as refunds and charge-backs, which traditional terminal manufacturers do not address.2. EMV Opportunities: With only 55% of retailers in EMV compliance (an average figure that we believe is largely skewed toward larger retailers, who are ~80-90% compliant, while micro/small merchant adoption is as low as 40-50%), Square faces a significant opportunity to market its own products. A disruptor in the space, it now operates in a rapidly changing POS environment, when the EMV adoption slows down the customer at the POS, complicates processing for the merchant, and thus raises incentives to switch to an alternative product, such as Square’s. We note that the Square Reader product can be both EMV and NFC-enabled.3. Attractive Pricing: Square charges merchants a payment processing fee of 2.75% on gross purchase volume (GPV), which is meaningfully below the merchant discount rate (MDR) of 3-4% that merchants frequently pay on non-Square transactions. In addition, the company charges a 3.5% fee and $0.15 per transaction fee for manually entered card-not-present transactions (where the incidence of fraud may be substantially greater). We note that about 70% of transactions are card-present and approximately 30% are CNP. We view this pricing structure, particularly for card-present transactions, as key to Square’s value proposition, since a lot of merchants have reservations about the rising MDR, especially for more expensive American Express transactions, as well as about the overall complexity of charges, since in addition to the MDR they often face incremental processing costs, such as batch fees and charge-backs.4. International Expansion is Key! We believe that Western Europe, Australia/New Zealand, and possibly Brazil, are the next geographic candidates for Square’s expansion. All these countries/regions saw rapid growth in smart-phones over the recent years. In addition, the number of POS terminals in the European Union is roughly equivalent to that in the United States, with about 10-11 MM terminals in both regions as of 2018. If we look at the POS terminal shipment data, for the year 2012 the United States was actually lagging many other key regions: out of a total ~20 MM terminals shipped during that year – the United States accounted for only 1.9 MM terminals, which in itself signals the vastness of the non-US opportunity for Square.5. Convenient Processing / Analytics: Square’s payments and POS services channel both hardware and software to enable payments acceptance. The Square Register product (a POS application) links into the mobile device, such as iPhone or iPad, to process the transaction. Square Analytics and Invoices allow merchants to study the back end and manage daily operations. Square acts as a merchant of record for sellers, handling complex systems and rules, and assuming the risk of charge-backs and refunds.6. Paradigm Shift in Payments: Over the past decade there has been solid transition from cash and checks to card products in the United States, with 1-1.5% percentage points of the entire purchase volume shifting from cash to cards annually. At present, there is approximately 55-60% of consumer payments volume processed on credit, debit, or prepaid cards, while about 25-30% of volume is still done via cash, checks, and money orders (“paper” transactions). According to a Nilson report, by 2022 there may be as much as two thirds of US consumer volume processed via card payments.We see the following risks to our thesis.1. Competitive Pressures:Square’s success could lead to entrance of new players, who would eat away a portion of the company’s market share2. Pricing Wars:We believe that SQ may more pricing headwinds from VeriFone and, to a lesser extent, Ingenico. Square already offers one of the lowest-priced products in this space; however, other companies are aggressively catching up.3. Economic Slowdown:As economy gradually softens in the United States, Europe, and China, we may see fewer lower payments volume, but, even more importantly, we may see fewer new merchants joining Square’s platform.4. Rise of Alternative Payment Solutions:With the payments space rapidly developing, we believe that a rise of various alternative solutions, particularly on the mobile side, possesses a significant threat to Square. Merchants are increasingly looking for an opportunity to save on the discount rate, which should foster more research in that direction and thus pose a meaningful threat to Square."

The departure of the CFO marked the top in the stock with product innovation lagging since the leading full-time executive's departure. The stock has more side as the company continues on the wrong side of momentum. Image Source: Square websiteOne can argue that Square hasn't launched a meaningful new product since the debit card for businesses all the way back in January. In March, the fintech revamped the Square Online Store and Square for Retail. These tools provide an integration with Weebly allowing for a solution to grow an omnichannel business.Either way, these are the prime product releases in 2019 since the hiring of new CFO Amrita Ahuja in early January. The reason the CFO position is notable is CEO Jack Dorsey splitting time with Twitter (TWTR). Even Twitter was most successful when Anthony Noto was the CFO running the push into streaming video partnerships.Going back to 2018, Square had these press releases for key product launches or acquisitions of products during the year:The fintech had prior to 2018 launched successful products such as Cash App and Square Capital. What made the stock so appealing to investors or traders was this constant innovation along with acquisitions that led to accelerating revenue growth. Now, the business is stagnant and reliant on the current business line that is in deceleration mode.The key gross payment volume metric based on mobile payments and other payment methods has been in constant deceleration. In Q2, payment volumes were only up 25% over last Q2 to $26.8 billion.Source: Square Q2'19 shareholder letterEven the company selling Caviar recently is a flip from the model of rapid expansion at nearly all costs.Momentum is a funny thing with stocks. Investors so willing to pay $100 for Square last year aren't even willing to load up at $60 now despite a substantially cheaper forward EV/S multiple. The combination of substantial sales growth and the stock price down 40% has the EV/S multiple down from levels topping 15x to only 8x now.Data by YChartsThe problem here is the the lack of innovation and aggressive acquisitions has the stock less appealing to the market. Investors couldn't justify the stock price last year and even now at 8x forward sales is more a fair valuation than an attractive valuation.Analysts expect rapid revenue deceleration in the next few years. The growth rate was forecast above 40% this year and the growth rate is already slumping into the 30s range in the quarter with an ultimate path to only 23% growth in 2022. Source: Seeking Alpha earnings estimatesIn essence, investors are paying $29.0 billion (487 million shares outstanding) for Square with a revenue goal of $3.9 billion in 2021 and $4.8 billion in 2022. The company still expects substantial growth in the years ahead, but the massive growth period is over as competition joins the fray whether in global payments or via alternatives to the Cash card.The key investor takeaway is that Square isn't a good value until the stock tests the $50 lows from December. The stock remains in a downtrend as the flip side of momentum catches up on the fintech that no longer innovates like prior to 2019."

The disappointing element to some investors (traders?) was the lower-than-expected outlook for Q3 2019, although everybody and his little brother should know by now that Square always guides very conservatively. Square sold Caviar for $410 million in cash and stock to DoorDash, with which it already had a partnership. Some investors and analysts were disappointed by this move and that could have put downward pressure on the stock, too. But I think this was a great decision. The margins are paper-thin and often negative in this business.The sale gives Square cash that it can use to boost its investments for bigger clients. Solutions for big retailers are still a weak point for Square and an investment there could pay itself back several times over. Don't forget that in Q2 2019, bigger sellers, with gross payment volume (or GPV) of more than $500,000 per year, already accounted for 26% of Square's revenue. In my first article about Square, I pointed out that Square's ecosystems are its biggest asset. Its products are all very tightly interconnected so it makes sense to combine them: accepting payment cards, using Square installments to split big sums into smaller installments with Square Installments, Square Capital for lending services, the Cash Card, the Square Payroll to pay your employees, etc. But these products are all from Square's original seller ecosystem, which is still expanding. A huge number of investors still associate Square just with its legacy payment system, but it has become so much more. (Square's original payment system, source)Square is rapidly building out a new ecosystem outside of this seller's ecosystem: a consumer ecosystem. And that has even a lot more potential than the first one. Crucial in this consumers' ecosystem is Cash App. It is basically a mobile app that allows you to transfer money, mostly smaller amounts, to another individual via the app or via email. Cash App is, as far as I know, the only app that you can use to pay with bitcoin as well. The Cash App ecosystem generated $260 million, already more than $1 billion on an annual basis, and that in just three years. $125 million came from bitcoin. Jack Dorsey phrased it in his own flamboyant way on the Q2 2019 conference call:That is actually incredible. $125 million in payments in bitcoin for this quarter alone. Don't forget that Cash App only started with bitcoin in January 2018. This shows its huge potential, I think.$260 million of revenue for Cash App on a total revenue of $1.17 billion is really substantial. It means that Cash App already generates 22% of Square's total revenue and has become, in a very short time period of just three years, the biggest contributor to Square's revenue, starting out from $0.(logo Cash App, source)In August 2018, just 18 months after its launch, Square's Cash App surpassed the number of downloads of PayPal's (PYPL) Venmo, which was launched in 2008 and was seen as the big winner in the space before Cash App came on the scene. And for 2018, the number of downloads was impressive. Cash App was in the top 20 of free downloadable apps of 2018, ahead that other Jack Dorsey app, Twitter:(From the Q4 2018 earnings call slides)Just to give some perspective: 15 million Venmo users engaged in a monetizable transactions and Cash App reported 15 million customers in its last quarter. For Square, the number of users is reported per month (MAUs), while Venmo counts them on an annual basis. In total, Venmo has 40 million users that are active on a yearly basis. Venmo is on its way to bring in $300 million for PayPal over a whole year, Cash app has a revenue of $260 million in a quarter. So Cash App is really outshining Venmo in a lot of aspects. Still, a lot of investors and analysts believe Venmo is the clear winner. While I like Venmo as well (I'm long PayPal, too), I think Cash App will become the market leader in the non-banking mobile payment service industry. In a Bloomberg article, it was made public that Square employees are testing a new feature for Cash App: free stock trades. As a stock aficionado and a Square shareholder, this makes my heart beat faster. The trading option again could over time grow to an important pillar in Square's consumer ecosystem that it is building out on Cash App. It would put the app in direct competition with Robinhood. That app was launched in 2014 and has become very popular among millennials because it facilitates trading stocks without charging a fee. Robinhood is very bare-boned in that sense that it just shows graphs of stocks and a limited number of corporate events, such as dividend dates.(Source)The way in which Robinhood makes money is with interest on cash in customer accounts, roundings of regulatory fees, phone transactions and foreign stock transactions. But the biggest source of revenue for Robinhood is from payment for order flow. Simplified, that is income from big players on the market that pay to influence how Robinhood makes its orders. In that way, they can make money by playing with the spread in high-frequency trading. If you want to know more about this, I would really advise you to read the article of my fellow contributor Logan Kane.Robinhood is reported to have 6 million customers. After its last funding round, Robinhood is now worth $7.6 billion. Cash App has the same group of users as Robinhood: young people. If Cash App, with its 15 million users, rolls out stock trading, a lot of young investors might want to use the feature. Maybe this will not be a big threat to Robinhood, but the feature would certainly attract clients from other online brokers. Last year, Robinhood's revenue was about $110 million, but it has grown a lot, especially because of the controversial payment for order flow, which grew by 227% versus the previous year: (Source: CNBC)Robinhood is, because it is still relatively young, still a smaller player in the big online brokerage market. E*Trade (ETFC) is the online broker that is being disrupted, but it still has a market cap of almost $11 billion, with a revenue estimate of almost $3 billion this year, on which it makes about $1 billion of profit. Robinhood and hopefully the trading feature on the Cash App platform could become this big over time, as millennials and the generations after them start using these platform. So over the longer run, the new Cash App feature could become a huge contributor to the revenue stream of Square. Of course, this needs time to play out. But if it is handled well, this could be another big win for Square. Square has been a really bad performer this year. But I think the stock needed the breather after three years of scorching results. With Cash App, the company has been building out a second ecosystem--this time, not of merchants, but of consumers. Adding a new feature, free stock trades, in this ecosystem makes a lot of sense and could boost the company's long-term revenue considerably. Although you never know what a stock will do over the short term, there are just too many positives for the stock not to follow the company's revenue growth over time.

4291677,99986,2019-09-16T06:10:52-04:00,"Square’s annual earnings per share continues to hit new highs, but revenue growth rates are beginning to decelerate.The stock continues to live under the 40-week moving average, and is acting weaker than usual at prior support levels.I see the stock as an avoid with both the fundamental and technical picture weakening.","The Payments Group (IPAY) has been one of the best spots to be for 2019, but Square (SQ) has barely been able to put up a positive year-to-date return. While the Payments Sector is up over 30% for the year, Square has a paltry 5% gain and is down 20% for this quarter alone. Investors continue to point to the fact that the stock is a steal as it's 40% off of its highs, but declining revenue growth rates suggest that the best days of growth are behind the stock. The company looks to be transitioning from hyper-growth to high-growth, and this often puts significant pressure on a company's valuation. This is especially true with the company currently trading at a P/E ratio of 100, and a price to sales ratio of over 6x. While valuation is not a great indicator for timing purposes, it does give some insight into how far a stock can fall if its trend does change. Square's monthly close below its 20-month moving average suggests a significant change of character, and this is a negative development for the stock. I see the stock as an Avoid, and I believe that 20% rallies going forward are opportunities to lighten up on positions.(Source: TC2000.com)Square was the tech darling of 2017, and this performance continued into 2018, with a more than 300% return over the two years. Unfortunately, for investors, the best days of growth seem to be behind the stock. While the company continues to see robust earnings growth with a new high in annual earnings per share [EPS] expected for FY-2020, revenue growth rates are beginning to taper off. Current revenue growth rates remain very robust at low 40% levels, but this new trend of potential deceleration is often an unfavorable period for hyper-growth stocks.Hyper-growth stocks, which I would label as those with 50% annual EPS growth and 50% sales growth, often trade at extremes at both sides of the spectrum. When growth is accelerating, they're consistently overvalued, and when growth decelerates, they can overshoot to the downside. Many investors are making the case that Square is undervalued at current levels, but this is irrelevant, in my opinion. Stocks rarely turn around on a dime just because they've touched fair valuation, just as they don't top the day they become overvalued. Instead, in the market, things oscillate from one extreme to the next. This is the reason why many traders have such a hard time trading in the hyper-growth phase as 40% corrections are run of the mill. We saw this from Facebook (FB) just last year when it transitioned from hyper-growth to medium-growth, and the stock plummeted from $218.00 to $125.00. While this correction didn't hurt those able to hang on, it certainly wasn't enjoyable for many traders who lined up to buy the stock above $170.00. The point is that I believe Square may be going through a similar situation here, and where the bottom shows up is anyone's guess. The next strong support for the stock comes in at $50.00, but this is still a reasonable amount below current levels. Let's take a look at the company's growth metrics below:Looking below at Square's annual earnings per share, we can see that the company continues to see strong growth. While there is some deceleration showing up, this is normal as a company matures. FY-2017 and FY-2018 earnings growth came in at 575% and 75%, and FY-2019 earnings growth is expected to grow an exceptional 63%. However, given that we are already in Q3 of 2019, FY-2019 earnings are in the rear-view mirror. The market is generally the most interested in the next 12-18 months, and FY-2020 earnings estimates are currently sitting at $1.11. While this still translates to significant double-digit growth at 43%, it is a material deceleration from the prior two quarters. This is not a big deal, and every single hyper-growth company goes through this as no company can sustain triple-digit earnings growth forever. However, this transition period is not always the best time to be aggressive with the stock. The reason for this is that the stock often swings from overvalued at its peak to undervalued at its eventual trough, but finding that undervalued level is not always an easy task. Given that the stock is still trading at a P/E ratio of 100 based on TTM EPS, I would not consider the stock undervalued here. The issue I see is that Square's revenue growth rate, which is the lifeblood of earnings, is also beginning to decelerate. Generally, the only way to re-accelerate or sustain earnings growth is through revenue growth. Cost-cutting is not an option for Square given all of the projects it has ongoing, and the high marketing spend for CashApp. The company's marketing expenses for CashApp were up 115% in Q2, with company-wide sales and marketing expenses up 59% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. Again, these costs are to be expected in a company looking for sustainable growth, but revenue growth deceleration coming at the same time as higher costs makes it very difficult to re-accelerate annual EPS growth. Let's look at revenue growth rates below: (Source: TC2000.com)If revenue growth was accelerating or maintaining its pace, one could make an argument that earnings growth may be able to re-accelerate. However, as we can see from Square's revenue growth rates, they peaked out in Q4 2018, and have been on the decline since. Q4 2018 revenue was $932.5 million, up 51% year-over-year, and we've seen a slight deceleration since to 45% and 44% in the most recent two quarters. In an aim to smooth out lumpiness in single quarters, I use a two-quarter average to define the trend in growth rates better. As we can see from the two-quarter average in revenue growth rates (white line), we've seen a 650 basis point slide from the 51% in Q4 2018, and are now sitting at 44.5%. This is not a massive issue as it's immaterial, but next quarter's revenues are the evident change in trend here. Not only are we expected to see the third quarter in a row of decelerating revenue growth, but this will drop the two-quarter average down to 38.5%. This will translate to a 1200 basis point drop the highs and is now beginning to look like more material deceleration. Q3 estimates are currently sitting at $1.17 billion, and investors are going to want to see a minimum of $1.20 billion to mitigate this deceleration. A miss on this $1.17 billion number by more than 1% would not be ideal.(Source: TC2000.com)Based on the fact that Square continues to trade at a P/E ratio of over 100, and is seeing decelerating revenue growth and earnings growth, this is not an ideal situation. If revenue growth was accelerating or maintaining its pace, an argument could be made for earnings growth re-accelerating. However, given that we have a deceleration in sales growth with a higher cost of sales, it's hard to see how the company is going to maintain its current earnings growth rate. I feel that the current estimates of $1.11 in EPS for FY-2020 are likely ambitious. While Square is not expensive by any means after a 40% correction, it isn't cheap yet, which is not ideal for investors buying the dip. The other significant negative is the stock's complete change of character technically. If we look at the technicals, there's not much to like across any time-frame for the bulls. On the monthly chart, the stock has put in its first monthly close below its 20-month moving average (green line) since this parabolic uptrend began. The worst part about this breakdown is that the stock has decoupled from the market and is no longer finding support with the market. While the Payments ETF, Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), and Pagseguro (PAGS) all ran to new highs this quarter, Square has been left in the dust. Not only that, the stock is busy trading below all of its key moving averages. This is a negative development and shows an unfavorable change of character in the stock. (Source: TC2000.com)On the weekly chart, the stock has strong weekly resistance at $83.00, and new short-term resistance at $63.20. Any rallies that cannot get above $63.20 on a weekly close can be considered as noise. The issue I see with Square here is that it's no longer respecting the past support levels it used to, and is acting lethargic despite a market sitting near all-time highs. This suggests that the stock is no longer in demand by institutions in the same way it was during 2017 and 2018. If Square continues to drop, the next support for the stock comes in at the $50.00 level, which is very strong support. While I wouldn't buy blindly at this level if we head there, I would keep an eye on the stock if we did begin to tag those levels as this would put the reward to risk back in the bulls' court.(Source: TC2000.com)The majority of analysts continue to remain bullish on Square, but I don't see any reason to rush in to buy a stock trading at a P/E ratio of over 100 with decelerating growth rates. The company's CashApp continues to do exceptionally well with total net revenue up from $1 million in Q2 2016 to $135 million in Q2 2019, but this has not been enough to keep revenue growth accelerating. While the stock is certainly not overvalued at current levels, I am less inclined to believe it's undervalued. Unless the company manages to beat significantly on its Q3 and Q4 numbers and guide higher, I see the stock as fairly valued at current prices. Based on the lethargic price action, I believe this is unlikely. I don't see any reason to bottom-fish on Square and see the stock as a sell into 15% plus rallies going forward as the trend is down. If the company can't put up $1.13 billion or better for revenue in its Q3 report, we may have a date with the $50.00 support level in Q4."
4289352,21798,2019-09-03T13:38:02-04:00,"Square and Shopify are both expected to grow at strong, above average rates for the foreseeable future.However, Shopify's valuation is at lofty levels, while Square's valuation is much lower.I see more upside for Square at these levels.","Square (SQ) and Shopify (SHOP) are both achieving strong above average growth. However, Shopify's stock keeps skyrocketing while Square's stock recently declined. The decline in Square's stock improved the valuation, which could make it a better buy from these levels.Square also has key competitive advantages over Shopify. Overall, I think both companies will thrive with above average growth over multiple years. However, at this point, Square is valued much lower than Shopify. That could make the stock a better buy from the current levels.Source: merchantmaverick.comThe main competitive advantage that Square has over Shopify is lower costs. Square doesn't have monthly fees (except for certain services), but Shopify has monthly fees at all levels. Square will provide a free basic credit card scanner that connects to smartphones and mobile devices for in-person businesses and their app is free to download. Shopify charges monthly fees that range from $9 to $299 depending on the level of services that you need.Both Square and Shopify charge transaction fees for every card purchase using their individual systems. Shopify charges a 2.7% fee for in-person transactions and 2.9% + $0.30 fee for e-commerce transactions. Square charges 2.75% for in-person transactions, 2.9% for e-commerce transactions, and 3.5% + $0.30 for keyed-in or card on file transactions (recurring payments). However, if you purchase Square's Register, card processing fees drop to 2.5% + $0.10.Shopify's highest tier of $299 per month does lower their transaction fees to 2.4% for in-person transactions and 2.4% + $0.30 for e-commerce transactions.Square's hardware is less expensive than Shopify's hardware. For example, Square's tablet stand, cash drawer, card reader, and receipt printer cost $535. The same package from Shopify costs $656. Square's chip and contactless card readers cost only $49, while Shopify charges $149.Overall, Square users have the cost advantage since they will pay less than Shopify users in most cases. Since Square doesn't charge monthly fees for their lower-tiered services, seasonal merchants won't have to worry about paying monthly fees when their business aren't generating much revenue.If you peruse the online reviews on each company, the consensus is that Square is typically best for those who have significant in-person sales, while Shopify's e-commerce offerings are more sophisticated, which might make Shopify a better fit for growing e-commerce businesses. However, both companies do offer both in-person and e-commerce solutions.Another competitive advantage is Square's Cash App. Cash App is Square's peer-to-peer payment service. Cash App allows users to pay for goods/services with their smartphones. What separates Cash App from other peer-to-peer payment services is that it allows users to accept direct deposit and ACH payments. It also allows users to purchase bitcoin through the app.Shopify uses Venmo as their peer-to-peer payment service. Venmo is owned by PayPal (PYPL). Venmo doesn't allow users to purchase bitcoin directly through their app. Square could attract investors who are interested in buying/selling bitcoin through the Cash App, giving Square another advantage.Both companies are growing revenue and earnings at strong, above average paces. Here's a quick snapshot of expected revenue and earnings growth for 2019 and 2020:Source: Capital IQShopify's stock took off in 2019, rising from $137 to the current price of $385 for a 181% gain. However, Square's stock went from $57 up to $81 in February, but then dropped to $60, returned to the $80s, and then dropped to the low $60s again.The sharp rise in Shopify's stock has the company trading at very lofty levels. Square's valuation is above average, but not at the nose bleed high levels like Shopify's valuation. Here's a side-by-side comparison:Source: finance.yahoo.comI look at Shopify's valuation metrics and my nose starts bleeding because the stock is trading at such a high altitude. Shopify's lofty valuation has the stock priced for perfection. Any negative unexpected news could trigger a sharp sell-off.Square's stock sold off after peaking around $100 in September 2018. Square's sell-off occurred on fears of a slower pace of growth. What if something similar happens with Shopify? Shopify's stock will probably sell off sharply on any unexpected bumps in the road or just on profit-taking from large investors.Square's stock is trading with an above-average valuation. However, it is not nearly as high as Shopify's valuation. It is reasonable for the stock to trade at an above average valuation because of their above average revenue and earnings growth.Square's growth isn't really slowing down that much. Does it really matter that its expected earnings growth rate is going from 64% in 2019 to 44% in 2020? Forty-four percent growth is still strong, above-average growth. Granted, that growth rate will probably not be sustainable forever. However, the company could still have multiple years of above average growth ahead as Square continues to expand the business.There should still be plenty of upside for Square as the company continues its strong growth and the stock gets back in vogue. The PEG ratio is a metric that has been useful to value high-growth stocks. Square's PEG is trading between one and two. This is a reasonably-valued or fair range for the high-growth stocks that I've covered. Growth stocks that trade in this range tend to outperform the broader market as their earnings typically grow at above average paces.The balance sheets of both companies look solid, but Shopify has the stronger one. It has 8x more total assets than total liabilities, while Square has 1.34x more total assets than total liabilities. Shopify has 11.5x more current assets than current liabilities, while Square has 1.5x more current assets than current liabilities.Shopify has $2 billion in total cash and $114.5 million in total debt. Square has $1.19 billion in total cash and $1.06 billion in total debt. Shopify's higher cash position and lower debt puts it in a better position for funding new acquisitions.For a point of reference, it is important to note that Square is generating 3x more revenue of $3.95 billion over Shopify's $1.3 billion over the past 12 months. There is a large disparity between revenue generated and their market caps. Shopify has a market cap of $40.7 billion, while Square's market cap is just $26.85 billion. Square generates 3x more revenue, but Shopify is trading with a market cap that is 1.5x larger than Square's. It doesn't seem like that is rational. It is not clear that Shopify will remain an outlier with such a high valuation over a long period of time, but it is possible.Shopify has a higher gross margin of 55.6% as compared to Square's 40.6%. Both companies have been running with negative net income. This is a result of high SG&A and R&D expenses. Here's how their expenses compare expressed as a percentage of revenue:Source: seekingalpha.comAlthough Shopify has a 15 percentage point GM advantage over Square, Square makes up for it with their 23 percentage point advantage over Shopify in terms of lower total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. Square's net income margin is getting close to profitability at -1.35% as compared to Shopify's net income margin of -5.98%.Both companies are expected to be profitable for fiscal 2019. However, Square is more likely to have higher net income margins as they maintain lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.Both companies are poised to grow revenue at strong, above-average paces for multiple years. The driving factor for this is the large amount of businesses that open each year. Over 627,000 new businesses open every year in the United States, according to the Small Business Administration. About 100 million businesses are estimated to start up each year on a global basis.Granted, many of these businesses will fail. Statistics show that 50% of small businesses fail within the first five years in the U.S. However, the high amount of businesses starting up each year and surviving will still be a strong driving force for Square and Shopify to grow revenue at a strong pace for the foreseeable future.Shopify's valuation is too high to be attractive. This puts Shopify's stock at a high risk of declining on any unexpected negative news. Square is valued at a much more reasonable level on a PEG ratio basis. Square's lower overall costs to their customers gives the company an important competitive advantage as new start-ups are likely to be attracted to their offerings. With the lower valuation, lower costs to customers, and above average growth, Square looks like the better buy right now.Let me know your thoughts in the comment section below."
4291407,71685,2019-09-13T11:30:38-04:00,The stock is extremely overvalued vs. peers.The put buyers have been active.The stock has broken key support levels.,"Square (SQ) has been getting hammered recently, and it seems that despite the recent pullback, the valuation for the stock still appears high. Even when comparing the equity to many peers in the payment space, the stock is overvalued. It may be one reason why some traders have been betting the stock will continue to fall.I first noted some bearish option betting taking place in Square on September 4. That was when the stock was trading around $61.20. I noted this in my SA Marketplace service Reading The Markets, Betting Square Falls. I have written on Square many times for the Free SA website in the past; you can track those articles and many more on this Google Spreadsheet I have created.The stock isn't cheap and trades at a valuation that is much higher than payment processors, Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and PayPal (PYPL). That difference isn't even small; it is by an extensive margin, based on a one-year forward PE ratio.Square indeed offers superior earnings growth to those other companies. But the biggest problem I find with Square is that it continually disappoints when it comes to future guidance. The last set of quarterly results was just another example. I noted in a previous article that Square has consistently underwhelmed investors when it comes to that guidance. We can see based on future earnings estimates that those estimates tend to start high at the beginning of the year only to trend lower.The underwhelming guidance may be one reason why the put option buyers are still coming after the stock. The options for expiration on November 15 saw their open interest rise by roughly 5,500 open contracts on September 13 to a total of approximately 11,700. According to data on Trade Alert, the options traded on the ASK, suggesting the puts were bought, a bet that the stock continues to fall from its current price of about $57.50 on September 13.The put contracts trade for about $3.30 on September 13, and for a buyer of those puts to earn a profit, the stock would need to fall to roughly $51.70, a drop of about 9%.The technical chart also shows that the stock is breaking down. The next significant level of support doesn't come until approximately $51.70, which by chance is the same as the options purchase.The chart also shows that volume has been steadily rising in the last few trading sessions. That would indicate that the stock is seeing an increasing number of sellers.The stock has already fallen sharply in recent days, and therefore there is the chance the stock sees a rebound. But at this point, if the stock does rise, it is likely to be limited. That is because resistance around $61 is expected to be very strong. That price had been an extreme level of support for the stock throughout August. What was strong support is likely to act as strong resistance once the stock breaks the support price.The most significant risk to my bear thesis isn't likely to develop until the company reports results sometime around the middle of November. Should the company report reliable results, and issue better-than-expected guidance, it will reignite the bull thesis and help to rejuvenate the buyers.However, there are many weeks between now and the next time the company will report results. Therefore the stock could continue to drift lower over the next several weeks, and if those put bets continue to pile up, it seems that the direction of the stock may only continue to lower."
4286391,100666,2019-08-17T04:58:44-04:00,"Square has announced its results on August 1, and although the company beats both on EPS and on revenue, the stock has fallen dramatically.Square actually has two ecosystems now: one for the sellers, and one for the consumers.The Cash App is still firing on all cylinders, and there are six ways in which Square monetizes it, making it the biggest contributor to the revenue now.The sale of Caviar to DoorDash for $410M in cash and preferred stock is an excellent move.In the second half of the year, the Eventbrite payment system will be launched. But Square still has lots of other options to broaden its universe.","Two weeks ago, on August 1, Square (SQ) announced its Q2 2019 earnings results. Despite a beat on earnings and revenue, the stock has lost a lot of its value. I introduced Square as a Potential Multibagger on March 11, and the stock has not done that well since then:But I am a long-term investor, and I still believe strongly in Square. In this article, I will give you seven reasons why. But first, we will dig into the earnings.(Source)Square did what it usually does: it beat earnings. Before we look at the latest results, I want to show you that Square almost always beats earnings:(Source: Streetinsider.com)This was the 13th consecutive quarter in which Square has met (twice) or beat expectations.For Q2 2019, the (non-GAAP) EPS came in at $0.21, beating the consensus by $0.05; the GAAP EPS also beat the expectations of the analysts, coming in at -$0.02 versus estimates of -$0.04. Without Eventbrite (EB) and the costs associated with it, GAAP EPS would have come in at $0.00. Later I will discuss more about Eventbrite and the big opportunity it shows.Revenue grew by 46.2% YoY to $563M, beating expectations by $5.33M.Q3 revenue guidance was essentially in line: $590-600M, while there is a consensus of $599M. I'm pretty sure Square will meet that consensus and probably beat it again.The guidance of 18 cents-20 cents EPS comes in a bit lighter than the consensus estimate of 22 cents, but here too I expect Square to at least meet the consensus.Despite the great earnings, with beats on both the top and the bottom line, Square has fallen quite a bit over the last two weeks:This too is not a unique story for this quarter. Square regularly falls after earnings, not because the earnings are not good, but because guidance is often seen as light by the analysts. This is an overview of Square's price action after it had released its earnings for each quarter since the results of Q1 2018:If you would only see these headlines, you would think that this must be an awful stock. But despite the big recent drop, it has still outperformed the S&P index (SPY) by a wide margin over the time starting from May 2, 2018, when the Q1 2018 results were announced:I think that it will continue to do so, despite the negativity of some analysts (and investors). I try to look behind the headlines of both the expectations game and the guidance game. Because the guidance game is also included in earnings: being conservative and guiding low is often seen as weakness, which I think is ridiculous. I like an under-promising, prudent, but over-delivering management.What I do focus on depends on the kind of company that releases earnings. Square is still growing at an insane rate, and for growing companies, the most important part is mostly growing revenue as much as possible, because that mostly tells you if the company is taking market share. And the revenue growth for Square was impressive: it went up by 46.2% YoY. The numbers were even more impressive if you take into account a few factors, which actually weaken the growth YoY. Square CFO Amrita Ahuja on the Q2 2019 earnings call:But what did investors react to after the earnings release? To earnings, profitability. One analyst, Mark Palmer of BTIG, gave another sell advice, citing weaker earnings guidance and revenue growth slowdown. Yawn. If you want high profitability, don't buy growth stocks, buy a dividend aristocrat or so. By the way, that analyst has sent out calls to sell from the time Square traded at $38.But that Square sinks so much may also have another reason, which is more understandable. It tends to sink faster when there is pessimism about a recession in the market. The reason is that its clients are for the most part SMB (small and medium businesses), which are seen as more vulnerable for an economic slump than bigger companies.I expect the revenue growth to come down a bit over time, due to the law of big numbers. I have had remarks about that law from readers, who may be mathematicians, scientists or programmers, and yeah, I know that there is a law of big number in probability and statistics too, but in finance, the law of big numbers means:So the growth will have to come down a bit eventually. That will probably be another reason for analysts to bring down Square. But, hey, I don't care. I love it when they bring down the stock price of excellent companies.So, Square's habit of underpromising for earnings and overdelivering is one of the seven reasons why I think it is an excellent buy.Three other reasons are in one quote. Before the actual results were revealed, Jack Dorsey, Square's CEO, said this:The words that I have set in bold and italics are three more reasons why I think Square is an excellent buy.As I pointed out in my previous article about Square, the company is outshining its competitors in its ecosystem. Its products are all very tightly interconnected into a flexible ecosystem. Clients can use Square's products all together, and it makes sense to combine them: accepting payment cards, using Square installments to split big sums into smaller installments with Square Installments, Square Capital for lending services, the Cash Card, the Square Payroll to pay your employees, etc. But these products are all from the seller ecosystem, which was Square's original ecosystem and is still expanding.But Square is rapidly building out a new ecosystem. That is reason #3.Cash App is what Jack Dorsey aptly called the second ecosystem, and it is probably the most important reason why you should own Square shares.Cash App is basically a mobile app that allows you to transfer money, mostly smaller amounts, to each other via the app or via e-mail. Cash App is, as far as I know, the only app that you can use to pay with bitcoin as well. The Cash App ecosystem generated $260M in total revenue in Q2, of which $125M came from bitcoin. Or in Jack Dorsey's flamboyant words:That is actually incredible. $125M in payments in bitcoin for this quarter alone. Don't forget that Cash App only started with bitcoin in January 2018. This shows its huge potential, I think.In general, $260M for Cash App on total revenues of $1.17 billion is really substantial. Cash App already generates 22% of Square's total revenue and has become, in a very short time period of just three years, the biggest contributor to Square's revenue, starting out from $0. (logo Cash App, source)From the app, you can use a Cash Card, basically a Visa (NYSE:V) card, to withdraw the money from an ATM or you can transfer it to your bank account. The Cash Card is a black card that looks pretty cool. By the way, there is a trend of creatively customizing the cards.(Cash Card, source)The number of Cash Cards came in at 3.5M, which is a great success since these users are monetized. Here too, the history is still very recent: the card was launched just two years ago. That shows there is a lot of leeway for it.In August 2018, Square's Cash App surpassed the number of downloads of PayPal's (PYPL) Venmo, which was seen before as the big winner in the space. And for 2018, the number of downloads were impressive. Cash App was in the top 20 of free downloadable apps of 2018:(From the Q4 2018 earnings call slides)In Square's Q2 2019 letter to its shareholders, this was emphasized again:Square monetizes the Cash App users through six different sources:Remember that all of these were introduced over the last three years and some just last year. And there is still more opportunity for Square to monetize the existing Cash App users, according to Amrita Ahuja, Square's CFO, on the Q2 2019 earnings call:And:So the Cash App is a great way to go to consumers directly. Square wants to get into the consumer financial services, not just the merchants', where it makes the bulk of its money right now.Former CFO Sarah Friar said to CNBC:(Former Square CFO Sarah Friar, source)Cash App is the part of Square that I am most excited about and will monitor closely.Square bought Caviar back in 2014 for just $90M in stock and sells the business now to DoorDash, with which it already had a partnership. ""The Grubhub (GRUB) for the rich"" as it is sometimes referred to changed hands for $410M, in cash and DoorDash stock. While this was maybe no big surprise (Square reportedly wanted to sell Caviar in 2016 already), some investors and analysts might have been disappointed by either the sale itself or the price that was paid.This is what Guggenheim’s Jeff Cantwell had to say, for example, about the sale of Caviar:(Source)I think this was a good move by Square, though. The food delivery business has a lot of competitors, with DoorDash, Grubhub, Uber Eats (UBER) and Postmates (POSTM) as the big four.(Source)Caviar got crushed in this cut-throat competition. As you can see, it is in the ""other"" category of meal delivery sales for June:The big four have a combined market share of 94%. All others combined only have 6%. That also includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Restaurants, which was actually closed down in the US in June. If Amazon, with its huge pile of cash and Whole Foods chain, cannot compete with the big four, why should Square continue its struggle for Caviar when it is not part of its core business? I think that joining the top dog in the industry, DoorDash, then seems like a great move. Square still has access to the upside by the preferred shares of DoorDash it gets through the deal, but it doesn't have the downside that it needs to invest heavily in Caviar to compete with the big four in the meal delivery space.Also, you shouldn't forget that the margins are very low in this business right now, often negative. If Square can get $410M in cash and stocks of DoorDash, the competition alone makes it a good deal. I'm not sure what happens to Zesty, since I couldn't find any information about it. The acquisition of this corporate meals startup last year now seems unnecessary. I think that Zesty will be included in the deal. If not, I expect Square to sell it soon.Jeff Cantwell, the Guggenheim analyst who sees this sale as a negative is right in one sense: Square bought Caviar in 2014 to diversify its ecosystem beyond digital payments. But Square is not the startup it was in 2014 anymore. It has already diversified enough, in my opinion. After a whole range of products for SMBs were rolled out, the company is now bringing in consumers too with its Cash App and all of the products that are attached to it.Was the Caviar buy unnecessary and even useless then? I don't think so. Square has made a large profit from the investment, but besides that, it learned how the restaurant industry works. It could develop Square for Restaurants in a better way therefore, its cloud-based restaurant management software that can handle service, delivery and counter registration. While Square Restaurants makes a lot of sense for the company (it ties into the ecosystem and has a higher margin), Caviar didn't anymore.Square has a small exposure to the trade tensions; in a sense its hardware is made in China. I'm talking about these tools: (Source)This could be one of the reasons too that Square saw its stock price plummet. Investors can be spooked about the business now that the tensions seem to be getting out of hand. After all, this is a very visible part of the company. Something physical feels real, but also vulnerable to production problems. But Amrita Ahuja, Square's CFO, said on Bloomberg that this hardware segment just accounts for 5% of Square's business. Besides the small impact on revenue, the company is also looking at other countries for manufacturing.One of the things I like so much about Square is that it has optionality. It can create an enormous amount of opportunities with collaborations and new initiatives. And that is what it does too. One of the best examples is the collaboration with Eventbrite.Eventbrite is an event technology platform. The company processes ticket sales and services for three million events yearly. Besides ticket sales, Eventbrite can also be used to promote ticket sales, manage events, analyze sales channels, etc.In September 2017, a partnership between Eventbrite and Square was announced. Because of that agreement, Square would become the standard payment platform for Eventbrite, both online as well as offline. Square also took a $25M stake in Eventbrite. The fact that Eventbrite's stock price has fallen so much is a headwind for Square now by the way after it was a tailwind in Q4 2018 after Eventbrite's IPO.Although the partnership dates back to 2017, the full implementation of Square's payments system is only expected in the second half of this year. Right now, it is in a testing phase and therefore it had an impact on Square's earnings. With more than $4B that flows through Eventbrite's system, this partnership could mean a serious boost to Square's business. Although Square will only be the American partner for Eventbrite (for now?), the US market represents 75% of Eventbrite's transactions.While Square is already quite big a big company with a market cap of $26B, there are still a lot of opportunities left for this company. International expansion is definitely one of them. The company has only been rolled out in five countries now: the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom. That's it. So, there is a lot of room for growth there.Square can also keep increasing its margins, especially now that the low-margin Caviar has been sold.Square's potential TAM is huge and it only has a tiny percentage of that. But with its two ecosystems (the sellers and the consumers) and the synergies and advantages of interconnecting the two, there is a lot of opportunities for growth left.ConclusionDespite the big fall in Square's stock price, nothing has changed fundamentally for the company. It still keeps expanding, and with its two ecosystems, the future looks bright. For investors with a long-term perspective, this is a good time to start a position in Square or to add to an existing position. As Square is a core holding for me, I have added 12% to my existing position on this big pullback.Square is a pick in the Potential Multibaggers series. More updates will follow.

4287790,62873,2019-08-25T16:58:18-04:00,"Two public companies dominate by revenue the non-bank small business financing space for the last six years. They are Square, Inc. and On Deck Capital, Inc.Their core business is called Merchant Cash Advance the hallmarks of which are no government regulation, extraordinary high rates of return on asset purchases, and a consistently expanding target market.MCAs are one of the newest fintech services and the field feels like gold rush days.","Two public companies dominate by revenue the non-bank small business financing space for the last six years. They are Square, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) and On Deck Capital, Inc. (NYSE: ONDK). Their core business is called Merchant Cash Advance (NYSE:MCA). There are a plethora of private MCA companies but we are not discussing them in this article except to point out the competition for SQ and ONDK.It is disconcerting that SQ and ONDK are rapidly growing revenues but neither generates exciting profits from their core business operations. Retail investors get no respectable ROI. So, I am reluctant to recommend retail investors put money into either of the two companies, but I believe there is more share price growth potential from ONDK in the long run because management is grappling to strengthen its core business. Source: debanked.comMCA is a largely unregulated industry growing out of and continuing to prosper from the turmoil of the 2007 economic meltdown. MCA growth is stimulated by the banking industry’s froideur to lending to small businesses. MCA companies, on the other hand, specialize in reaching out to undercapitalized businesses, owners with just fair credit ratings, and assets already pledged or doubtfully secure.A Merchant Cash Advance is not a loan as courts have ruled. Therefore, federal and state governments’ rules and regulations for loans and what is considered usurious lending rates do not apply. Additional fees, commissions to brokers, and penalties merchants may be liable for are also largely unregulated. An MCA is a purchase of future assets with the merchant buying back those assets using future credit and debit cards deposits coming from future sales. I see little standing in the way of the MCA industry continuing its rapid expansion (est. 20% annually).In exchange for a quick turnaround and little paperwork an advance lump sum payment, fewer fees, and commissions are made to the merchant from an MCA capitalbacker. The company withdraws money out of merchant deposit accounts from credit and debit cards sales on a daily or weekly schedule for a specific length of time. Here is one scenario from Georgia McIntyre, February 2019:First, privately owned MCA companies are opening every day and targeting the same merchants.Second, there are some creeping changes in bank lending. For instance, in July, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) pulled out of its working relationship originating new JPM small business loans with ONDK. Shares dived 22% on the news. JPM made no definitive statement why it abandoned the relationship but told American Banker in 2016, JPM entered into it to speed-up decision making and funding of JPM’s small business loans using ONDK technology. Third, exacerbating stress to share prices are reports that small business loan approvals at big banks are hitting record highs. Competition from banks approving more small business loan applications is worrisome, but continue merchant application processing delays and setting high credit standards. MCAs get money merchants in 48-72 hours.Fourth, and this might have spurred JPM to break off with On Deck, came a slew of bad publicity and publication of consumer complaints about MCA companies. It made headlines at Bloomberg and in newspapers. The collection tactics of some MCA capitalbackers on defaults of buybacks by merchants are reportedly much more aggressive than collecting on traditional loan defaults resulting in a lot of bad press. Nevertheless, small business merchants are not anything if not hopeful and confident. Small business merchants “know” their businesses will generate enough receipts to buy back their assets in a short time frame. The extra dollars they pay mean little over the long term. The lure of an upfront lump sum infusion of cash is enticing to get them through a tough time.Another caveat for investors is the significantly higher rate of default on assets buybacks from merchants than traditional loan makers. MCA capitalbackers with top-shelf due diligence analytics and collection agencies still experience defaults that chip away at profits. The Small Business Administration estimates its default rate is two percent. MCA buyback defaults are believed to be significantly higher but there are no figures.SQ is steadily expanding financial services it offers users but that investment is doing little to improve the financial quality of SQ. It's market cap today is nearly $27.5B. The company claimed a $31.9B market capitalization at the beginning of 2019. The 52-week high share price was $101.15 but share price dipped to $50.37 at the beginning of 2019, as the company remains unprofitable. Too many observers are impressed that the Q2 ’19 revenue of $563M is an increase of 46.2% Y/Y. EBITDA grew 54% suggesting profitability may not be far off but not in Q3 ’19 according to the company guidance.Generating excitement about the stock is not prospects for its core business but the new business plan offering other financial services. SQ introduced the free debit Cash Card, a Cash App bitcoin exchange to which the CEO is pledging to make a seminal investment, and the Cash Boost program of discounts at retailers and restaurants when users pay with their Cash Card. People extrapolate from anecdotal information that these programs are generating substantial profits but there are no breakout impact data to value their impact on a company that lost about $63M in y’17 and $38.5M in Y’18. Square posted a loss again in Q2 ’19 of $7M compared to Q2 ‘18’s loss of $6M only losing money in five of its last six quarters despite higher revenues. Observers are impressed overall revenue reportedly jumped one billion dollars in 2018 over the previous year but at this rate, the greater the revenues the faster SQ is heading to the cliff of disaster.SQ offers a stylish black card for its Cash App service that boasts 7M active users. Cash App is a mobile phone app payment service proprietary to Square allowing users to transfer money to one another or email. Users are able to transfer money to another and to a cash account via its Cash App or email. They are able to withdraw money using its debit Visa card, called Cash Card, in ATMs or transfer it to a local bank account. Users sign their name on the mobile app and the signature is printed into the card and sent to the user. Cash App also supports ACH direct deposits. July 2019 was the biggest month ever for Cash App downloads. Cash App generated $135M in Q2 for Square.Source: FintelIt appears that the 32 analysts set a price target for SQ topping $84 and recommending a hold or buy are overly impressed by revenue generation and the companies new products, rather than considering how badly the SQ core business is floundering. Institutions hold an increasing number of shares, yet insiders have been selling shares in large blocks throughout 2019. I like ONDK as a better investment than SQ at this time. There is significantly more room for share price growth by the end of 2019 strengthening the company’s organization, focus and intrinsic value. Also, management is paying serious attention to the with low-interest rates and merchants searching for alternative financing. 33% of small business owners know that “lack of capital/cash flow is their number one problem and only a small percentage are versed in financing businesses. That bodes well for ONDK with MCA as its core business.Source: Deck CapitalBeing number two in the public sphere of MCA companies gets ONDK little respect or attention. Holistically, the company’s financial position appears healthy despite suffering setbacks. But it is grappling with its problemsOn Deck offers alternative financing programs in addition to its bulk business of MCAs. It offers lines of credit and term loans. It sells technology to banks and others wanting to make fast decisions about delivering capital to merchants.Source: FintelMoreover, there is not much to say for a takeover should another company be interested with origination volume down, yield declining and loan losses are a looming threat. My concern is mostly for the ineluctable level of debt (~253%) compared to net worth; management is struggling to reduce the debt and it will help if operating cash flow continues to exceed total debt. But that is going to require strict operating procedures and smart decision making on every new MCA. Meanwhile, insiders are buying more shares than selling this year.If management is confident in the quality of its technology, which does not appear to be the reason JPM walked away, management might want to consider building the platform and marketing it to community banks, private MCA companies, start-ups in the business, etc. Technology services coupled with new financial services instruments (including some banking services) ONDK is beginning to offer could prove to be sources of significant income enhancing the core business profit center.The MCA industry is continuing its strong growth trend despite bad press and other negatives. MCA capitalbackers can strengthen their positions hiring outside firms to undertake due diligence examinations and others specializing in collections in the MCA arena. It appears too for the near term the cost of money for MCA companies will remain cheap and the stand-off position of federal and governments from regulating the MCA industry make for a gold rush time.The MCA business is growing in popularity worldwide. There is a new British MCA Association dedicated to promoting the industry to merchants. MCAs are being used in Australia and Canada (OTCPK: OTCPK:IOUFF). Small Business Trends reports having surveyed more than 2,000 small business owners. Merchants rank “money management skills” next to last among the Top Characteristics for Running a Successful Business. This leads me to believe the MCA has a whole new target market among small business owners who will be turning to capitalbackers when banks turn them away.MCAs might feel like a gold rush with promises of amazing returns to capitalbackers. Just remember what Mark Twain warned prospectors, ""During the gold rush its a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.""Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4287108,69965,2019-08-21T12:49:44-04:00,"Investors sold because of revisions to Q3 projections. It seems like they missed the part that the full year numbers didn't change.The company is targeting and winning larger sellers, and those larger sellers are growing faster as well.Love or hate Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency seems to be driving users to the Cash App.While Square's 2019 valuation doesn't look that exciting, 2020 is a far different story.","I get it, Square (NYSE:SQ), by traditional valuation metrics, isn’t cheap. Before its recent decline of roughly 20%, the forward P/E ratio sat around 100. For some investors, any change to the story was going to be an immediate sell signal. With this in mind, we need to look at why investors seemed disappointed with Square’s guidance. Based on the company’s comments, it seems this recent decline is an overreaction. Once investors realize Square’s growth narrative hasn’t changed, the shares should recover nicely.When a stock carries a forward P/E of over 100, investors are quick to judge instead of waiting around to see how the story develops. The consensus seems to be that investors sold because Square cut its third quarter estimates. However, as we can see, Square essentially left its full year forecast unchanged.(Source: Square quarterly earnings)There are a few reasons a company might cut its guidance for the upcoming quarter. It may be experiencing softness in sales, Square is not. The company might have trouble launching a big product or service, Square is not. The reason for the company’s adjusted guidance was outlined by the CFO Amrita Ahuja.One of Square’s biggest businesses is merchant services. Anyone who knows the retail industry realizes that it is very cyclical, and the end of the year is of critical importance to many businesses. One thing that many companies don’t do is make big changes to their operations during the fourth quarter. As a former salesperson to small and medium-sized business, I’ve seen this firsthand. What business owners say when you ask them for business in the fourth quarter is, “maybe at the beginning of next year we are just too busy right now.” I’ve heard it over, and over, and over again.Square is taking this information and adjusting its marketing expenses to try and grab market share. Spending money to take market share before the all-important fourth quarter is a smart move, and Square’s management knows this. If we can ignore the shortcomings in the company’s Q3 guidance, the full year guidance takes on new meaning. The company said, for the full year, it expects the same revenue, same adjusted EBITDA, and the same adjusted EPS, as the company’s prior guidance. In short, Q3 is going to look lower than investors expected, but the company expects to make this up in Q4 enough to keep full-year guidance the same.The first reason Square’s sell-off is overdone is the company’s seller ecosystem is growing fast and shifting toward larger sellers. If we look at a breakdown of the company’s recent numbers, the trend is obvious.(Source: Squareup)Square essentially started off as an option for smaller sellers. Businesses that generate smaller revenues aren’t normally targeted by many larger merchant service providers. The sellers that produce $125,000 or less in gross payment volume (GPV) represented 54% of Square’s total GPV in 2017. By 2019, sellers with less than $125,000 in sales are now 46% of total GPV. We can see from this change, even though Square still is a great option for smaller sellers, the company is setting its sights on bigger customers as well.Two years ago, the slightly larger sellers in the $125,000 to $500,000 in GPV range, represented 27% of Square’s total GPV. In the most recent quarter, these same sellers sit at 28% of GPV. The larger sellers are where the big story is developing. In 2017, Square only generated 19% of its total GPV from sellers with $500,000+ in GPV. In the company’s last quarter, larger sellers now represent 26% of that number.PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a natural competitor to Square in both merchant services and personal payments. PayPal said its Merchant Services volume increased by 30% in its recent earnings. With Square’s overall GPV increasing by 25% year over year, some investors might worry the upstart is being left behind. However, the key to Square’s future GPV growth seems to lie with its larger sellers.What some may have missed is these larger sellers are growing their GPV at a faster rate than Square’s overall GPV growth. In fact, in the current quarter, the GPV of these larger sellers increased by 45% year over year, or 80% faster than Square’s overall GPV growth. As the larger sellers become a bigger and bigger part of the whole, it’s possible Square’s GPV growth rate could increase. Since GPV essentially feeds a big part of Square’s revenue growth, faster GPV growth should translate to faster revenue growth as well.The second reason Square’s selloff seems overdone is the potential of Bitcoin to drive new users to the Cash App. No doubt when most people hear the word Bitcoin, they have a reaction. Some believe that this cryptocurrency is the future. Others believe it’s essentially no more than a lottery ticket. In either case, Square seems content to bet a big part of the future of its Cash App on Bitcoin. If we compare Square’s Cash app to PayPal’s Venmo service, at first, they look very similar. Both allow you to send money to almost anyone. Both apps are consistently near the top of the iOS or Android app stores. Where the two seem to separate is when it comes to Bitcoin.(Source: Cash App)Square’s Cash app allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin directly from the app. According to Square, “Cash App charges no fees when you buy or sell bitcoin.” Square hasn’t been secretive about how it views this capability for users. Last year, the company said of Bitcoin, “It’s not a major monetization engine.” If Square doesn’t charge a fee and doesn’t expect to make a lot of money on the service, why offer it? The answer is simple, “The goal is to continue to drive utility in the Cash App.” If we look at the volume of Bitcoin running through the App, the strategy seems to be working.In the current quarter, Square generated $125 million in Bitcoin revenue, with a gross profit of $2 million or 1.6%. During the same quarter last year, Square generated $37 million in Bitcoin revenue, with a profit of $420,000 or 1.1%. With a gross profit margin of less than 2%, Bitcoin isn’t going to be much of a factor in Square’s bottom line. However, the service’s 238% increase in revenue is a different story.This isn’t to say it’s impossible to use PayPal’s Venmo to buy Bitcoin. Given that Venmo’s total payment volume increased 70% year over year, the service is doing quite well. The difference is, to buy Bitcoin with Venmo, you need to find a Bitcoin exchange that offers this payment option. Venmo becomes little different than giving a Bitcoin exchange another payment method, there is no integration directly in the app.In the short term, Bitcoin allows Square to post eye-popping revenue growth. In the long term, Square can begin charging a small fee to buy or sell Bitcoin or increase its spread to allow for bigger profits. As an example, Coinbase (a well-known cryptocurrency site), has a spread of about 0.50% on purchases and sales. In addition, Coinbase charges a fee that can range from less than 1.5% of the total transaction to as much as almost 10%. If Square began charging a fee of, say 2.5%, on each purchase and sale, in the current quarter, this would have added about $3 million to profits.In the end, the profit margin may not be massive, but driving more customers to using the Cash App means bringing them into the ecosystem. At that point, Square can attempt to cross-sell business owners on all its other products and services.The third reason Square’s recent decline is overdone is because of the share’s relative value compared in particular to PayPal. Looking at forward P/E ratios for 2019, it’s a close race, Square’s P/E is just over 83, but with a 46% 5-year expected EPS growth rate. This puts Square’s PEG ratio at 1.80. PayPal’s 2019 projected P/E is just over 34, with a 5-year expected growth rate of just over 19%. This gives us a PEG for PayPal of 1.79. Now, there are a lot of built in assumptions, but at present, the two stocks trade at an almost identical PEG valuation.When we move to 2020, the numbers change significantly. Based on analysts’ expectations, Square trades at a 2020 P/E of 57.5. With the same 46% 5-year expected EPS growth, this drops the company’s 2020 PEG to 1.3. By comparison, PayPal’s 2020 P/E ratio is expected to be 30.4. Using the same 19% 5-year expected EPS growth rate, yields a PEG of 1.6. As we can see, by next year, Square’s stock looks like it could be a relatively better value than PayPal.There is another wrinkle to these assumptions that works in Square’s favor as well. Over the last four quarters, Square has beaten expectations each time by an average of nearly 24%. PayPal has also beaten expectations each of the last four quarters, but by an average of 10%. Given that Square has a history of beating expectations by a larger percentage than its peer, one could argue that analyst estimates may be too low. If Square is a better relative value than PayPal using current estimates, if the company can continue this hot streak, the numbers become even more compelling.Square seems underappreciated at present. The company’s revised third quarter outlook doesn’t change what the company expects for the year. On the business side, Square is targeting and winning bigger customers. These larger sellers are also growing their GPV faster than the whole. On the personal side, love it or hate it, Bitcoin is helping the Cash App to gain new users and new revenue. When we add in the stock’s attractive relative value, investors looking for a fast growth stock, at a recent discount, have an option staring them Square in the eye."

She was the highest executive working full time at Square.Data by YChartsThe selling of Caviar will further cut out revenues from 2020. The online ordering food platform was bought by DoorDash (DOORD) for $410 million and contributed somewhere in the $50 million range to quarterly subscription revenues. Square didn't provide the actual revenues, but Caviar was the second largest product line in the $251 million subscription business behind Cash App at $135 million.The core transactions business is down to only 25% gross payment volume growth. The consistent decline in the core business provides a large drag to accelerated growth needed to maintain the current market valuation. The loss of key subscription revenues will dent the bull case here no matter how much the market will try to shift back towards organic growth.Square guided to 2019 net revenues of $2.275 billion, and analysts are targeting 35% growth to reach $3.070 billion in 2020. These revenue forecasts could take a $200+ million hit from Caviar that reduces the reported growth rate to only 26%. The market will slowly shift towards the profit equation now that the mobile payments company has reached scale and maxed product innovation.Investors expecting those irrational growth rates to sustain for a longer period are likely caught off guard here. For 2019, Square only forecasts adjusted EBITDA of $410 million. With 487 million diluted shares, the stock at $65 still has a market cap of $32 billion.What typically happens now is a further rationalization of the stock valuation. Would you pay $32 billion for $400 million of EBITDA? Investors that bought Square for $100 or even held onto the stock at that price face 35% declines and are still coming to realization that the opportunity to sell at those premium prices has long passed.The impact is that Square likely retests the yearly lows at $50. A market cap closer to $25 billion provides a better entry point allowing for upside potential to new equity investors.The stock would trade at 8x 2020 revenue estimates and about 60x the adjusted EBITDA forecast for this year. The reality is that these valuations are more base case levels and not the type of valuations that should make an investor want to load up on the stock.Analysts have irrational targets still up above $80 and a market valuation approaching $40 billion. The average analyst may not be listed as bullish, but these valuations suggest analysts still need to wake up to the new growth metrics.Source: Seeking Alpha ratings pageThe key investor takeaway is that the investor community is waking up to the realization that a stock down $35 from highs isn't even a bargain yet. Square is now on the wrong side of momentum that suggests a retest of the recent December lows at $50 before even thinking of touching the stock.Once Square updates revenue estimates with the exclusion of Caviar and analysts update targets based on these cuts, one can look for an attractive entry point."
4279573,71685,2019-07-31T13:21:53-04:00,Square has underwhelmed investors with its forward guidance.There has been bearish betting in the options for the stock.The technical chart is breaking down.,"Square (SQ) will report results on Aug. 1 after the close of trading. Based on options trading, bets are being placed that Square's stock will fall below $80 following its results. Given Square's history of issuing downside earning guidance, the bets make sense.According to thefly.com, on Feb. 27, the company offered first quarter EPS guidance of $0.06 to $0.08 per share, which was less than analyst consensus estimates for $0.11 per share. It was on May 1 the company again fell short of estimates, guiding second quarter earnings to a range of $0.14 to $0.16 vs. estimates of $0.19 per share.But the history of disappointment goes back even further. On Nov. 7, 2018, the company issued fourth quarter 2018 earnings guidance for $0.12 to $0.13 vs. for $0.15 per share. On Aug. 1, the company issued third quarter 2018 eps guidance of $0.08 to $0.10 vs. estimates for $0.13 per share.The most significant risk to Square isn't the second-quarter results, but it is third quarter guidance. The company has a history of underwhelming when it comes to earnings guidance.On July 29, there was a spread trade created that resulted in the open interest for the Sept. 20 $80 puts and calls both rising by about 12,500 contracts. When digging deeper, according to data from Trade Alert, the puts were traded on the ask, which indicates they were bought. It would suggest that the stock falls below $80 by the expiration date. (Square September $80 Puts - Trade Alert)Additionally, the $80 calls for the same expiration appear to have been sold as part of the spread transaction. By selling the calls, the trader is betting that stock does not rise above $80 by the expiration date.   (Square September $80 Calls- Trade Alert)The puts were purchased for $5.00 per contract. Meanwhile, the calls were sold for $5.40 per contract. In total, the trade received $0.40 per contract to create the spread transaction.  I created an instructional video to help walk you through figuring this out in my Seeking Alpha Marketplace service. The options market currently is indicating that the price of Square's stock rises or falls by 6.8% from the $81 strike price for expiration on Aug. 2. It would place the stock in a trading range of $75.50 to $86.50 following the results. By comparison, the S&P 500 SPDR (NYSEARCA:SPY) ETF is expected to rise or fall by just 1.25% from the $300 strike price by the same expiration date. Volatility for Square is expected to about five times greater than the broader market over the next few days. The last time I wrote on Square was for my market place service on July 9, noting the stock was breaking out from its then price of $77 with the potential to rise to around $83. I created a google spreadsheet for my Marketplace service like this one that tracks all of my articles. Now I see a different case for Square. The technical setup for the chart appears to be weakening, which also would suggest that Square may be due to drop following results. The technical chart shows that Square has been struggling at a level of technical resistance around $83 since the start of July. That level has proven to be very challenging for the stock. The equity also has been rising along with an uptrend since the beginning of June. At this point, the stock needs to break out and rise above $83, or it's at risk of plunging back to $75.00 from its current price of about $81.40 on July 31, a drop of about 8%. The relative strength index is now trending lower despite the stock trading sideways. It would appear to be a bearish divergence, a sign that the stock is losing momentum and is poised to fall back to support at $75.It seems safe to say that Square has a history of underwhelming investors when it comes to future earnings guidance. After four straight quarters in a row of issuing downside earnings guidance, it makes sense as to why some traders may be betting that Square's stock falls following results."
4260761,57621,2019-05-07T01:52:29-04:00,"Square Inc.'s fair value is estimated at $74 and seeking to establish a long position between $64 and $65.I am writing put options at $65 to receive a short-term 10% yield if Square Inc. trades above the strike price by May 31st, 2019.I am bullish on Square Inc.'s long-term strategy to grow the support ecosystem for small and mid-sized retailers and on the potential of Cash App.","I am bullish long term on Square Inc. (SQ) but have yet to establish a direct investment in the company. Instead, I have opted to take a long position through selling put options on the stock while I patiently wait for an entry point, which is $64, based on a 10-15% discount over my fair value estimate of Square Inc., which is $74.(Source: Summary of Historical Financials from Sure Dividend)Note: Square Inc. publishes adjusted EBITDA figures, but I have not used the adjusted figures for the basis of valuation because I think the reported GAAP financials are relevant in evaluating the business, not simply part of its business which management focuses investors on.Based on historical performance, management has been able to grow new businesses like the Cash App, and over the course of 6 years, has grown gross profit margin from 23% to 40%. This establishes a fundamental base for Square to leverage existing businesses and build on new products. The cash-generating capability of the company has also significantly improved. As a result, I see 2019 as a period of growth and transition into a profitable, well-oiled company.However, Square Inc. share price dropped by 6% after the Q1 earnings announcement and weaker Q2 guidance on May 1, 2019. While full-year guidance was maintained, management had reported strong growth in the Cash App active users as well as growth potential post Weebly acquisition to grow the Japan market.My fair value estimate was based on price-to-sales 7x based on 2019 expected sales per share of $10.50 (30% year-on-year growth). As a comparison, PayPal (PYPL) and Shopify (SHOP) trade at 8x and 25x respectively.Investors and analysts are concerned that competition will intensify for Cash App as it wrestles for market share alongside PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Venmo and Zelle.(Source: Digital Trends)Below are comparisons obtained from SimilarWeb comparing Square's Cash App against Venmo and PayPal based on Google Play Store rankings. Clearly, Cash App is seen as the more popular app on Android. The Apple Store stats show a tighter competition between Venmo and Cash App, with Venmo having the better user ratings as well for both Android and iOS. That is probably due to its social features, which makes using the app easy and fun. Overall, my sense is that the competition between Venmo and Cash App remains fierce, but it is currently difficult to ascertain which one is in poll position. Venmo claims 40 million yearly active users, whereas Cash App claims it has 15 million monthly active users. What is clear, however, is both services are growing. Cash App reported only 7 million monthly active users in early 2018, and in its latest Q1 announcement, reported that Cash App volumes grew 2.5x year on year.(Source: SimilarWeb)With 65 million Americans under-banked or unbanked, what is clear is that there is strong growth potential for both Venmo and Cash App.While biding my time to enter Square Inc. in the $64-65 range, I am writing short-duration put options to receive some cash flow and yield.(Source: My brokerage account)I am short 2 put options of Square Inc. at $65, earning a premium of $0.70, which brings the average cost to enter the stock at $64.30 per share. Assuming Square maintains above $65 by the end of month, I potentially recognize the $0.70 as realized profit. The required margin is $1,300 for 2 options and the net yield would be $133 after commission and fees, 10% yield in this situation on the utilized margin.The fundamental view is to purchase shares in my target price range and continue earning some cash flow until I am able to establish a long position in the price range between $64 and $65.The risk, however, is that due to error in judgment or sudden unforeseen market corrections, I might have been able to acquire shares at a much cheaper price. As such, it is important that I take a long view on the strength of Square Inc.'s ecosystem and regularly assess this view based on updated insights and developments in this company."
4255697,22717,2019-04-22T12:25:49-04:00,"Since my last article on Square in November 2018, in which I argued that the company had a valuation problem, the stock has stayed flat.Based on my analysis and projections, Square's stock is likely to continue to tread water, while its growth catches up to its valuation.Larger clients is not necessarily great for its growth, which is likely why it's moving into the Cash App peer-to-peer business.","I argued in my last article on Square (SQ) ""Square's Valuation Problem,"" dated November 13, 2018, that the company was worth no more than $48-49. The stock was trading at $73.27. Today the stock is at $70.74, so it has actually fallen 3.4%. The company reported increased revenue, EBITDA and cash flow on both a year-over-year and consecutive quarterly basis. I think ""tread water"" effect is going to continue for a good while, at least a year.There are several reasons for this. As I pointed out in the last article, SQ is comparatively overvalued - without good reason. It trades at 2-4x the valuation metrics of its peers, even though its margins are subpar compared to its peers. The only logical reason for the valuation premium is that SQ's growth rates are higher than other companies in its industry. The net effect is that SQ will have to grow into its valuation. As its revenue, EBITDA and cash flow levels increase, and assuming the valuation remains at similar levels, its premium valuation will fall.These points can be seen in the following tables and analysis.The first mistake that many analysts make with SQ's valuation is by only counting its publicly traded A shares in calculating its Enterprise Value (EV). A significant number (22% of the total), $6.5 billion out of the total $29.4 billion EV, is made up of non-trading super-voting shares B shares. These are often not picked up by cursory analysts in the calculation of the company's EV:Source: HakeThis is important because by using EV rather than Market Value in the numerator of most valuation metrics produces higher ratios. Remember, EV is what a company is worth to a competitor if it were to make a buyout offer. No company is going to make an offer for just one group of shares, nor ignore the amount of debt or net cash on the balance sheet. Many analysts like the fact that SQ has no net debt, but they forget to start with the higher market value (including the B shares) when calculating EV.Source: HakeSo SQ has a $29.4 billion Enterprise Value. But it only produced $1.6 billion in sales, $225 million in adjusted net income, and $256 million in adjusted EBITDA cash flow in 2018. Here are my estimates for the next few years:Source: HakeAnd here are the resulting valuation ratios for the next few years:Source: HakeI used the same methodology to estimate future growth and margins, as in my previous article on Square in November 2018.The problem is that SQ's peers have nowhere near these vaulted valuations:Source: Hake estimatesSo, for example, SQ has a 2019 forward EV/Sales ratio of 11.9x, and even a 2020 ratio of 8.0x, whereas its peers' median valuation is only 5.4x. This is still 60% higher than the median two years out (and assuming a significant sales growth rate for SQ).The same is true for the EV/EBITDA ratio comparisons. SQ's 2020 EV/EBITDA ratio (i.e. two years from now) is 55x (assuming significant growth in EBITDA), whereas the median right now is only 20x.As I pointed out in my last article, SQ does not deserve this valuation premium due to it having higher margins. That is not the case. Square has much lower margins. The reason for the valuation premium is SQ's growth rates are much higher than the average of its peers.Here is the bottom line. Based on my analysis, I think SQ is worth no more than about $50.19 per share, using the same methodology as in my last article. This is about $20 below its present price, making it 28-30% overvalued. But I don't believe SQ will fall to this price, excluding any general market crash. It is much more likely SQ will tread water until its valuation metrics (based on the denominators rising) get much closer to the industry averages. This could take several years.One of the impediments to SQ's growth rate (i.e. a slowing in its rate of growth) is the fact that SQ is aiming to have a larger percentage of its customers as higher revenue clients. It is harder to win over these clients, especially in the restaurant and hospitality business, as the competition is much more fierce.The following chart from its 10-K shows the growth in Gross Payment Volume (GPV) base of its clients:Source: Square, Inc. - 2018 10-K Report SEC Filing, page 9This shows that less than half its clients now have revenue of less than $125K and now more than 24% of its clients have revenue of greater than $500K.The problem is that as SQ reaches for more higher revenue base clients, its pricing will not be competitive. Just to give you an example, I recently compared SQ's pricing for its Square for Restaurants product compared to one of its competitors, SoftPoint (SoftPoint | Aloha & Micros POS EMV on DataPoint), a privately-held company, and for which I am a consultant. I discovered that as the revenue of a potential client restaurant increases in value, Square's product is increasingly uncompetitive. It turns out that for a restaurant doing $1 million in sales, Square's product line is about 60 basis points more expensive. For a restaurant having up to $5 million in sales, SQ's product line is 75 basis points more expensive than SoftPoint's point-of-sale product line called DataPoint. In the long run, given that restaurants operate on thin margins, this comparable deficit is unsustainable for SQ. My conclusion is that although SQ's revenue base will continue to grow from its roots of smaller shops and restaurants. SQ will face increasing competition as the average mix of its clients' revenue increases in size and hence its rate of growth will slow from historical levels.Source: SoftPoint, LLC (www.softpointcloud.com) - Hake estimates of comparison of SoftPoint pricing to Square for RestaurantsThis also may be why Square is turning to the B-to-C market with its Cash App program, a peer-to-peer payment app. No one knows yet how profitable that market will be for it in the long run, but it is likely that SQ will push into this arena more heavily than using its resources to find higher revenue clients. First, it gets a sort of millennial valuation pop for this B-to-C revenue line. More eyes using its Cash App may lead to more lines of revenue like advertising, for example. This could give it a rebound effect on its valuation depreciation. Second, its Cash App could let the company take on other competitors like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and maybe their valuation metrics as well.Square is still 28-30% overvalued, but it is likely to trade at these levels until its growth figures increase the denominators in its valuation metrics. Growth rates will slow in its underlying business as it takes on higher revenue clients. This may lead the company to rely more heavily on B-to-C products like the Cash App to keep its valuation at these lofty levels."
4264409,22148,2019-05-15T17:54:54-04:00,Square is now down over 35% from the highs last year.Investors weren't impressed with Q2 revenue guidance.Revenue deceleration in 2019 was always a problem for the stock valuation.A double bottom at $50 would reduce the risk equation for a new long.,"Unfortunately for shareholders that bought into the moon shot thesis, Square (SQ) now trades far below $100. The market now, rightfully so, has questions about the sustainable growth rate for the mobile payments company, causing the stock to come back to earth.Image Source: Square websiteAnybody following my previous research knew that revenue growth was going to decelerate in 2019 and beyond. A stock never maintains lofty valuation multiples in such a scenario.Square saw peak adjusted revenue growth of 68% in Q3 last year. No surprise to anybody listening, the stock hit a peak of $101 in September that happens to reside in Q3.Source: Square Q1'19 shareholder letterAs highlighted over and over, Square's revenue growth was artificially boosted by the acquisitions of Weebly and Zesty last Q2. The only reason that revenue growth surged into the 60% range were these deals.In fact, without these acquisitions organic revenue growth was only 49% in the last quarter. Even worse, Square beat on Q1 revenues by over $9 million, but actually guided down for Q2 with revenues below analyst estimates of $555 million.Source: SA earnings pageFor the year, Square slightly boosted revenue estimates, but the number wasn't the typical boost forecasting growth in excess of expectations. Without a big guide up, the mobile payments leader is left to trade based on analyst estimates for revenue growth to slip into the 35% range in 2020.Analysts now forecast that Square reaches revenue of about $3.1 billion next year. The stock still has a valuation of $31.2 billion based on a diluted share count of 487 million.The stock trades at about 10x '20 sales estimates. Remember, this is based on Square down at $64, not the stock back at $100.Data by YChartsThe above chart uses the basic share count due to the reported GAAP losses, but the key metric is how the stock has finally lost momentum. The Cash app has gone through the major growth phase and Venmo from PayPal (PYPL) has started fighting back.Nomura Instinet estimates that the download gap between the Cash App and Venmo narrowed to only 296K in April. Analyst Dan Dolev and his team estimated that a 600K download gap existed in January and Cash App had 22.8 million downloads in 2018 for a 6.6 million lead over Venmo.The December stock low around $50 appears a good target price for investors looking to own Square for the long-term growth in the 30% range. At $50, the market valuation dips to $24.4 billion for a forward P/S multiple of slightly below 8x.The stock may never dip back to $50, but the returns for long-term investors are boosted by buying the right price. A double bottom would provide that ideal signal that investors are indeed getting in at the lows.The odds are far improved from those when investors bought the stock at $100 with a forward P/S multiple at an absurd 20x. Those investors are already sitting on 35% losses after holding the stock for nearly 9 months.If the stock were to reach $125 by September 2020, the following annualized returns would be achieved by investors:While this is a simple calculation using round numbers, the exercise shows the flaws in investors holding onto the stock assuming future upside. Such investors have seen significant losses or given up large gains for the potential of minimal future gains.Even under a bullish scenario, an investor will see modest upside after holding Square for two years that doesn't warrant the risk. An investor holding for a more bullish price entry has 12x the potential upside gain.The key investor takeaway is that Square is finally trading back to earth. The momentum that boosted the stock above $100 is now hurting the stock as analysts like Dan Dolev lower the price target by $15 to a still reasonably high $90.The best way to reduce risk on Square is to look for a double bottom opportunity around $50 where the stock isn't ridiculously priced based on sales estimates."
4250505,71685,2019-03-22T10:38:21-04:00,JD.com and Square have both seen an increasing number of bullish options bets.Both stocks have bullish technical patterns.JD and Square have both risen at nearly triple the pace of the S&P 500 in 2019.,"JD.com (JD) and Square (SQ) are two stocks that have rocketed higher in 2019, with both up more than 35%, almost triple the pace of the S&P 500. Now an analysis of the options market and technical charts suggest both are heading even higher in the coming weeks.I last wrote on both of these stocks individually around the end of February at the time their earnings, noting that Square's Big Post Earnings Plunge May Vanish Fast and Why JD.Com's Stock May Pop Following Results. I first noticed bullish activity in Square in the middle of January in my Seeking Alpha Market Place offering Reading The Markets: Square's Stock Is Breaking Out.Square's open interest levels for expiration on April 18 has increased sharply, rising by 6,125 contracts at the $83 calls. According to data from Trade-Alert the calls were traded on the ask, and that would suggest they were bought. For a buyer of those calls to earn a profit the stock would need to rise to approximately $84.80, an increase of 8% from the stock's price of $78.20 on March 21.The stock also has seen bullish activity in the $90 calls for expiration on May 17. The open interest has increased by nearly 3,400 contracts to a total level of approximately 5,600. A buyer of those calls would need the stock to rise to a price of around $91.90, an increase of almost 18%.The stock has been trending higher since the middle of January. Now the shares are heading toward its next level of resistance at $83, and should the stock break out and rise above that level, it could trigger a rise to nearly $92.Additionally, the relative strength index has been trending steadily higher in recent weeks. It would suggest that bullish momentum is moving into the stock.JD.com also has witnessed bullish momentum in recent days. The calls at the $29 strike price for expiration on May 17 have seen open interest rising by nearly 9,000 contracts to almost 15,000 contracts. According to data from Trade-Alert, the options traded on the ask, suggesting they were bought. A buyer of those calls would need the stock to rise to roughly $30.60, an increase of about 8% from its price of $28.70 on March 21.The $30 calls for the same expiration date have seen increased activity in recent days too. The open interest for those contracts has increased by nearly 7,500 contracts to approximately 19,000 contracts. A buyer of those calls would need the stock to rise to roughly $31.25 to break even, an increase of almost 10%.The chart shows that the stock has been consolidating around the $29 level. It appears to be creating a bullish flag, a continuation pattern. It would suggest that the stock breaks out and rises to the next level of resistance to around $34.80. The relative strength index continues to trend higher and suggests that the bullish momentum continues to enter the stock.These two stocks have been among the hottest in the market, and as long as bullish momentum in the market continues, it seems that traders and investors are betting the stocks continue to climb. However, should the global economy slow further or hopes of a trade deal deteriorate, these two stocks could suffer greatly."
4287319,98236,2019-08-22T10:56:34-04:00,"Square shares fell noticeably after a quarterly earnings release that should have heartened investors.The company continues to grow at 45% +.Concerns about the 25% growth in GMV miss the point of the company's ""eco-system"" strategy.The company is seeing triple digit growth in its ""Cash"" business segment, now 22% of total revenues and a higher percentage of margins.The company's sales of the Caviar food delivery service will allow for Square to redeploy capital while preserving a strong eco-system covering the restaurant sector.","Square reported the results of its fiscal Q2 a couple of weeks ago. The results and the guidance have not been well received. At this point, the shares have lost 22% of their value since earnings were released. Of course some of that is a function of the risk-off trading that has marked the environment over the past couple of weeks. The IGV index has lost 8% since the time of Square’s earnings release. But Square shares have not performed well this year, gaining just 10% YTD, while the IGV is up 20% over the same span. So, the question is what has happened at Square and are investors and observers missing the forest for the trees. Just to put the conclusion first-I think they are.I own Square shares and have done so for some years now. I have recommended the shares to my investment community Ticker Target. And I have directed trades in my managed accounts to own Square. I think it is very cool to own Square shares at this time and more important, I expect the shares to generate positive alpha.Before engaging in an extended discussion, I think it is well to recapitulate the results that Square reported and its guidance. Square’s adjusted revenue rose by 46% year on year. Its gross payment volume rose by 25% and its subscription and services revenue rose by 87%. Square gets about 60% of its gross profit from processing payments, and the balance of its revenues from its subscription and services business. The gross profit on subscription and services revenue rose by 102% year on year-it is a much more profitable business than payment processing. The company generates a small amount of revenue from hardware (about 4% of the total), and it loses money on that. The hardware business is part of an offering that attempts to provide all the IT requirements for small and medium size sellers. Needless to say, those percentages are, and will continue to change as the company evolves, and especially as its subscription business shows such material growth.At this point, the company’s Cash App has reached a quarterly run rate of $135 million, about 24% of total revenue, and was 54% of subscription revenues. Cash App itself, consists of 6 services at the moment, of which the two most important are Instant Deposit, and Square Card. The growth of the cash app has been meteoric, to say the least, as it really was not a revenue contributor 3 years ago. In that time, the services available from what the company calls Cash App have multiplied, and the company is enjoying a considerable network effect.Besides the Cash App, Square has a lending activity, Square Capital, a food delivery service that is being sold, Caviar; and an Instant Deposit service. In addition, it offers a variety of small business software apps which are really in a nascent state at this point. One brokerage who tracks Cash App downloads, has recently written that the “app download tracker points to a positive inflection in Cash App downloads in July.”The company has ramped some of its operating expense categories substantially, more or less in line with prior announced plans. On a GAAP basis, research and development costs rose 53% and sales and marketing costs rose 58% year on year last quarter. Much of the increase in sales and marketing expense came from costs associated with the cash app, which saw a 115% increase in costs related to peer to peer transactions, risk losses and card issuance. The increase in sales and marketing costs outside of the cash app was 32%-and as will be discussed later, that really is less than optimal for a company with the opportunities of this one.The company did achieve some leverage at scale because general and administrative costs rose by just 22% year on year. Transaction losses, as recorded in GAAP rose by 62%, a bit less than associated revenues. The cash transaction losses actually fell year on year, a significant factor in the company’s strong cash flow performance. Overall, the company broke even on a GAAP basis last quarter, a minor improvement from the prior year.The company achieved strong levels of EBITDA, which rose 55% year on year. Much of the increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by the increase in both depreciation, but in particular stock based comp., although that metric is rising a bit less rapidly than adjusted revenue.Square’s operating cash flow has more than doubled year to date. Some of that relates to much higher depreciation than in the year earlier period. Share based compensation rose substantially, although at a bit slower rate than revenues. Given Square’s business model, it does not currently generate any substantial level of deferred revenues. Much of its cash flow relates to balance sheet items and the flow of funds through Square Capital. At this point, I do not think that looking at cash flow is a substantial item in valuing the shares although I keep track of the metric, mainly for comparability.At the moment, as we calculate it, Square has a forward EV/S ratio of just a bit higher than 10X, based on a 12 month forward revenue estimate of $2.66 billion. Our revenue estimate is pretty much in the middle of the consensus for that period which is currently $2.65 billion. The consensus estimate for growth next year is 34.5%. We think for several reasons that this will prove to be substantially lower than should be the case.Our relative valuation analysis shows SQ shares at the bottom valuation of the 40% growth cohort by a significant margin. They are actually valued at average for 25% growth, suggesting that their valuation is unusually constricted. Although cash flow would not be a preferred way of valuing the shares for several reasons, the company’s current margin of free cash flow is average/above average for its growth cohort.Many analysts and commentators have suggested that the share price of Square was negatively impacted by its guidance. As is the case for many high-growth companies, it does well to look carefully and listen hard when considering guidance as a material factor in evaluating the shares. That is particularly true in this quarter, because the impact of selling Caviar, on both current results and going forward has not been made clear. We know that Square is selling its meal delivery service to a company called DoorDash for $410 million which will be a mixture of cash and preferred stock. DoorDash is the largest meal delivery service in the US and it has raised substantial funding from private equity, including $400 million in February.We do not quite know the run rate revenues of Caviar might be, although the brackets the company revealed suggest revenue of perhaps $200 million/year. Needless to say, Caviar has had substantially lower gross margins than the rest of the revenue stream from services and subscription. The interesting thing is that DoorDash is part of the Square platform/ecosystem, and apparently, that relationship will continue with DoorDash offering Square’s orders API and Square for Restaurants to its clients as part of its delivery offering. We will have to wait until after the merger is consummated before Square provides us with guidance that excludes the Caviar revenue stream. I imagine that the new guidance will not include the specifics of either a greater investment in sales and marketing as the company suggested, or any revenue increment from greater sales and marketing investment.But just for the record, Square’s guidance was unchanged on a non-GAAP for full year (the company made a valuation adjustment for its investment in Eventbrite (EB). The guidance is for full year revenue growth of 43% and full year growth in adjusted EBITDA of 60%. Is that Square’s best guess as to the outcome for the last half of the year. To be sure, it is not something that will ever be determined because of the impending sale but almost inevitably, this company has beaten revenue numbers, and most of the time it has beaten its adjusted EBITDA forecast as well.The company has a policy of reinvesting over-attainment back into its business through funding higher levels of opex. Is that a problem for investors? This writer feels that it is an appropriate strategy. Other commentators may not. During the course of the Q&A discussion, the CFO suggested that guidance had been raised enough in the prior quarter. Whether the comment ought to be taken seriously is hard to say.In any event, the 6.5% sequential growth forecast for this quarter would represent a sharp deceleration in percentage growth. Sequential growth in adjusted revenues was 15% last quarter and while there can be some summer seasonality in GPV growth, I expect that once again, Square will continue to over attain its revenue guidance. Square has forecast that Q4 growth will be around 5%. This is almost certainly a sand-bag simply because the effects of Q4 seasonality on GMV have been seen in many years.As I alluded to earlier, the growth of the Cash App alone, is likely to be greater than the sequential growth the company has forecast-particularly with the latest confirmation of strength for Cash App downloads in July from a 3rd party source.As a shareholder, I can wish that Square would raise its revenue guidance every quarter. And indeed, looking at the specifics of the revenue growth last quarter, and comments regarding top of the funnel growth and rising sales productivity, I think it would have been reasonable to have done so. But the fact that the guidance wasn’t increased, and the shares reacted as they have, affords an opportunity for investors, one that I believe can be used to advantage in constructing a high-growth portfolio.I think it is fair to acknowledge that not all investors or analysts reflect a rosy view of this company. There are several discrete issues, that I will try to deal with. The company has 31 analysts reporting their ratings to First Call. Of that group, 17 have buys and the 14 have holds. While most analysts maintained their rating, and modestly increased their price target, Evercore now has an underperform rating on the name. In general, I prefer to see a balanced set of ratings on a company, although I am not totally sure if there are real correlations between analyst ratings and future performance. Square is not really a contrarian play, but it is not a name that is particularly loved either.Here then are some of the investment issues that are likely currently constraining valuation:Much of what I have written here reprises a post I prepared for my Ticker Target subscribers about 10 days ago. I had been asked by several subscribers to comment about the putative FedNow payments system, tentatively scheduled for release in 4 or 5 years. It has been described as an “existential threat” to Square. I think it is obvious that if FedNow was really a material threat to Square’s Cash App it really would be a material threat to SQ’s overall business. But that is highly unlikely to happen. I doubt that FedNow will evolve such that it is really a threat to Square, or more particularly the banks who already offer instant deposit services.Just for the record, according to the PYMNTS.com blog, the Monetary Control Act makes it illegal for the Fed to create a service that is already available from the private sector. I do not purport to be an expert on the Monetary Control Act, or its interpretation, but it is relatively self-evident that there are many available instant deposit services of various kinds. Fed Governor, Randall Quarles, voted against proceeding with the authorization because he believes is violates the Monetary Control Act.A governor supporting the new system, Lael Brainard said as follows ""the Fed is not looking to displace or directly compete with the various private-sector services already proliferating in the market, but to leverage its pre-existing inbuilt connections to over 10,000 U.S. banks.While the private service has a large part to play in this market, she noted, the Fed’s size, scale and long history in the U.S. payments system means it can create a level of accessibility to faster payments that could not be matched in the private sector in any kind of reasonable timescale. Instead, the goal of the FedNow service is to serve as an infrastructural platform on which the private sector can easily build.”How that happens is of course not known at this point. While eliminating Square’s Cash App revenue stream would be a massive blow to the company’s financial basis, that simply doesn’t seem likely based on what both proponents and opponents of FedNow have said.I tend not to want to be either alarmist or to present scenarios that seem unlikely based on less than complete data. There are people who want to avoid risk and perhaps FedNow will be a risk-but then again, a company like Square, with so many services that are components of its futures is going to face a goodly number of challenges in terms of operational performance, regardless of the Fed.Last quarter, the various services that make up Square Cash generated $135 million in revenues. The company has forecast adjusted revenue this quarter of about $600 million. So Cash would be about 23% of revenues, and most probably a greater proportion of gross profits. Some component of Cash is based on consumer cards and services, and some component of Cash is based on various infrastructure services that depend on other Square offerings. Just how much, if any, of that part of Square could be affected by FedNow is unknowable since the Fed itself hasn’t decided on the parameters of the service.I would point out to readers/investors, that for years various banks have had instant cash options-think Zelle, and that PayPal (PYPL) has a similar set of business and consumer options-think Venmo and instant payment. Whatever winds up getting designed is going to be materially influenced by banks and other payments vendors. While other countries have government sponsored payments networks, it hasn’t seemingly impacted the performance of their banks or payments vendors.It is hard to determine, what if any of Square’s share price under-performance recently might be related to concerns regarding FedNow. It is, I believe, an evolution that bears watching, but I think the threat is likely to be far less than some may have feared. There are many barriers to the Fed actually creating a set of services that in any way competes with Square Cash, or for that matter any of the myriad other cash transfer services.While it is difficult to calibrate, and I haven’t either access or time to read all that has been written about Square, I imagine the decline in GPV growth to 24% has been the most significant factor in the under-performance of the shares in since the earnings release. One might reasonably compare the GPV growth of 24% for Square to the 51% growth in GMV reported by Shopify (SHOP) and wonder if the Square growth engine has been or will stutter or if Shopify is taking market share from Square in situations where they compete.One thing to note is that GMV growth for companies the scale of either Square or Shopify simply has to come from sellers with greater sales volume. And Square has been a bit slow in pivoting its marketing so that it focuses more marketing resources on cultivating larger sellers. As it happens, the larger sellers for Square showed a 45% year on year growth in GMV this past quarter.I noted earlier that Square’s growth in sales and marketing, excluding the amount spent on the Cash App grew 32% last quarter. Given the numerous opportunities Square has had to fund, it seems likely that the company has under-funded efforts to build its seller community at substantial rates.The company over the years since it has been public, has focused far more on its eco-systems both for Cash and for Seller, than on creating a large funnel to acquire new users. Shopify, which basically has a different financial model in getting lots of its revenue from helping users create web sites, has cultivated that opportunity assiduously.I do not think that 45% growth is a disappointing level of revenue attainment for this company. And ultimately, the company will make more money on services and software than on processing payments. And the CFO noted that GPV from the Cash App is not included. But the company is now focused on building its funnel of new customer acquisition, and that should start to have a material impact on results by the end of this year The company is going to accelerate some sales and marketing spend with the proceeds of the Caviar sale.One of the obvious questions at this point is what does Square need to do in order to compete with many other companies who offer mobile/cloud POS solutions. I believe that much of the skepticism regarding the shares has to do with analyst belief that the growth rate of the GMV, which has been less than 30% for 2 quarters now, is more representative of the future of this company, than the 45% revenue growth that has been achieved over that same span.The differentiator that is being missed, is, has been and will be the eco-system. The payment process itself, is, to be sure a fungible one-although Square claims it does it better than competitors. But what is not so fungible are the services to which sellers can acquire that can be integrated with payments that is available from Square and not available from some of its competitors. I have talked to a few Square sellers over the years, and I believe that the eco-system strategy is one that has worked and continues to provide potential value to Square’s user base.Again, I do not know exactly how Square compares to the many competitors in the space in terms of all of its features/functions. Linked here is a 3rd party evaluation that says that it is https://fitsmallbusiness.com/best-mobile-credit-card-processing/-. But overall, it seems to have the set of software apps that are optimized for mid-sized users that apparently resonate with its seller community and with 3rd party analysts and potential users. These apps, which are very easy to install and use without professional assistance. encompass things such as payroll, CRM, invoicing, appointments and inventory. In addition, there are numerous 3rd party apps for Square. Here is a link to a list of apps that are said to be the best available for Square users-Best 14 Square Apps for Small Business Payment Processing - Small Business TrendsI think that Square management has made a good case that additional investments in sales and marketing , as well as through offering of hardware that appeals to potential sellers is likely to lead “to very good outcomes.” The statistics that were presented during the call would certainly suggest that the ROI for Square is very high on that kind of spending-the payback is said to be 3 quarters and to have most recently improved from a 4 quarter payback. The comment that the company is “going to pull the string” to accelerate the growth in its various user cohorts obviously makes sense if the company has the best solution, and has the solution with the highest level of potential revenue drag.There are, to be sure, many reasons why investors are willing to afford SHOP shares very high valuations. But one reason is obviously the persistence of GMV growth of greater than 50%. I am not sure what the target for Square’s focus on acquiring new and larger users might be in terms of GMV growth-it probably isn’t 51% and it doesn’t need to be that high. But I think the opportunity is significant, and the tactics-for the most part (other than advertising seen on the New York City subway shuttle urging riders to build their Square ecosystem)-seem well thought through. The company said that its initial foray into the program reached 7 million sellers and that it delivered positive early traction in terms of top-of-the funnel metrics.As mentioned, Square has seen a tsunami of growth in the various services that make up its cash app. Once again, I think that some investors/analysts don’t appreciate the “why: and simply confine their analysis to skepticism that the company can maintain such performance. I confess when I first read about Instant Deposit, for example, I had a hard time believing that a large group of business people would surrender 1% of their revenue to get their money a day sooner.Square Cash apparently grew at triple digit levels last quarter based on my inference from the company disclosure. I obviously do not imagine it will continue to grow at that level indefinitely, not does it need to do so in order to suggest that the current consensus growth forecast for 2020, which is less than 35%, is likely to be significantly exceeded.Overall, Square Cash has 6 sources of monetization these days. At the moment, the sources are 1) Instant Deposit; 2) Cash Card; 3) Business Accounts; 4) P2P transactions funded with a credit card; 5) Bitcoin; 6) Interest on customers’ stored balances. The preponderance of the revenues are coming from Instant Deposit and the card. The company only counts the gross margin it earns on Bitcoin transactions on revenue-that was $2 million last quarter. The company CEO apparently loves Bitcoin, but he is certainly not taking improvident steps to invest Square in that technology.As I wrote earlier, based on downloads, Square Cash is gaining momentum and surpassing the results of competitive services including Venmo, offered by PayPal and the originator of the category, and Zelle, the service owned by several large banks. There are services that rate just about everything these days-including an analysis of cash transfer apps. The one linked here suggests that Square has the best service-from the point of view of consumers and it makes sense, therefore, to find it a massive share gainer. Here is the link for those interested. Send Money as Easily as you Send an Email with Square Cash.By having a rather extensive set of interrelated offerings, Square has found it easier to monetize the activity generated by the cash app at increasing levels. Square Cash volumes apparently grew by 150% last quarter, and capital originations grew at 36%.Square offers a service calls Boost. Boost is an offering that permits Cash Card users to get instant discounts on merchandise and services when they use the card. Obviously the discounts are paid for by merchants but the program has proved exceptionally popular and is one of the levers that has stimulated the growth of Cash Card.I have linked here to another review-this time of Square Cash for Business. This service is also highly rated and it is a service that has been generating specific revenues at an accelerating rate. It seems the author is suggesting that it is cutting into the market for PayPal’s services-although we would have to see both offerings evaluated side by side with revenue statistics to actually know that. Here is the link-Square Cash App Review | Merchant MaverickOne thing that might be noted is that while there is really GMV associated with Square Cash, because of the nature of the offering, Square does not include that metric as part of what it reports as GMV. It is one reason, why using the GMV metric as a way of evaluating this company simply misses the point-it is the success of the eco system and total revenue growth that is most significant.Square doesn’t forecast its results below the total revenue line. And I do not imagine that Cash will continue triple digit growth-although the demand for Instant Deposit transactions continues to amaze this writer. I do believe that the company will continue to develop services to keep its overall rate of growth for Cash well above the growth of “the market.” I expect more sellers to take advantage of Boost which is really just in its infancy. I think the service which offers P2P transactions funded with a business card has very substantial potential in the market that is Square’s target.Just to sum up, SQ shares have a relatively reasonable valuation. Based on my current estimates that were revised in the wake of the company’s earnings and forecast, the shares are trading at less than 11X forward revenues. My guess is that the current forecast for 12 month forward revenues from the First Call consensus, which is about $2.66 billion will be exceeded by a noticeable percentage. The EV/S ratio of Square is at the absolute bottom of the 40% growth cohort.We have mentioned earlier that Square’s free cash flow is a bit difficult to use in valuation. Square has some components in its financial makeup of a bank and other components as that of an operating business. But the company is quite profitable for a business with this kind of growth. The company is forecasting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18%. EBITDA margins have risen mainly because of revenue growth, and the leverage the company has had on general and administrative spend. The company, from time to time has forecast increased opex spending will impact the company’s EBITDA margin-but so far that has not really been the case.This company, under its current leader, has proven to be exceptionally innovative in developing new products and services for its user base. It is always difficult to evaluate management on an objective basis. I might like Jack Dorsey better in a different outfit, and with less hair on his head and on his face and a different political outlook. But regardless of those things, and the fact that he continues to run 2 complex businesses simultaneously, his team has done an outstanding job with Square’s franchise and I think the user reviews which are linked in this article, and the analysis of the company’s opportunities from management’s perspective are reasonable evidence that things are going better at Square than is currently embodied in its valuation. At some point, I expect the concerns that have been constraining the shares to relax so that investors will get higher valuation on coupled with rapid growth. That is a formula for positive alpha."
4265035,20521,2019-05-18T00:06:55-04:00,"Square is looking to offer a comprehensive ecosystem of services that's sticky or something that a young entrepreneur or startup might grow to use.These include business loans, payroll services, POS solutions, and now omnichannel commerce.This expansion of its ecosystem makes it attractive but also increases its range of competition.","Earlier this month, mobile payments platform Square (NYSE:SQ) announced its first quarter results. While the results outpaced market expectations, a lackluster first quarter outlook disappointed the market and the stock fell 8% since the results announcement.Square's gross revenues grew 43% to $959.36 million. Adjusted revenues for the quarter grew 59% over the year to $489 million, ahead of the Street's expectations of $479.63 million. It ended the quarter with a net loss of $38 million, or $0.09 a share, compared with a loss of $24 million, or $0.06 a share reported a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the EPS came in at $0.11, compared with the market's forecast of $0.08.By segment, subscription and services-based revenues grew 126% over the year to $ 218.9 million. Transaction-based revenues increased 26% to $656.8 million. It generated $12.2 million revenues from the hardware business and revenues from Bitcoin soared 92% to $65.5 million.Among other metrics, Square's gross payment volume came in at $22.6 billion, marginally short of the estimates of $22.8 billion.For the current quarter, Square forecast gross revenues of $1.09-$1.11 billion, adjusted revenues of $545-$555 million and an EPS of $0.14-$0.16. The Street was looking for adjusted revenues of $557 million for the quarter with an EPS of $0.18. Square expects to end the current year with revenues of $4.41-$4.47 billion, adjusted revenues of $2.22-$2.25 billion compared with the market's forecast of $4.42 billion, and adjusted revenue forecast of $2.26 billion.Square is continuing to drive growth through several key initiatives. It's focusing on larger sellers, those who generate more than $125,000 in annualized gross payment volume. During the quarter, it saw revenues from these sellers grow 37% over the year and account for 51% of its total GPV as against the 47% contribution a year ago. It's also driving adoption in the mid-market sellers with annualized GPV of more than $500,000. This segment grew 50% over the year and accounted for 24% of total GPV, compared with 20% contribution a year ago.Its Cash App ecosystem also is continuing to thrive. The peer-to-peer payment app now allows direct deposit, Instant Deposit, and Cash for Business features and has seen transactions grow nearly 2.5 times within a year of its launch. Within Cash App, it's not only seeing a growing number of monthly active Cash Card customers, but also an increase in transaction frequency per customer.Recently, Square also entered into an agreement with Postmates. Postmates offers a network of couriers who deliver food, groceries, and alcohol locally. As part of the agreement, Square customers can use Postmates' couriers to get goods to customers who place orders with Square. Square already has its own food delivery service Caviar, based on a company it had acquired in 2014. But the deal with Postmates will help expand its market reach since Postmates is present in more than a thousand cities.Square also is investing in the AI segment. Earlier this month, it acquired Eloquent Labs, a small business-focused conversational assistant. Based in Redwood City, Eloquent Labs uses AI tools to enhance live chat customer support agents at eCommerce players. Its flagship product Elle can hold natural and conversational dialogs with customers fully autonomously by relying on natural language processing and AI capabilities. Square plans to leverage the solution to offer an AI-enabled chat solution to its payment customers. Prior to the acquisition, Eloquent Labs had raised $1.5 million. Owler estimates its annual revenues at $6 million. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.Besides building a robust product portfolio, Square also has helped build a thriving developer community. It allows developers to use APIs and SDKs free of charge. Developers can build self-service kiosk applications that are powered by Square Reader SDK and are streamlined for in-store ordering processes. It also offers several third-party apps on its marketplace that provide services ranging from accounting and tax support to e-commerce, marketing, and inventory and logistics management.Earlier this year, Square released an In-App Payments SDK that provides a customizable payments flow that works with most popular payment types. The SDK will allow developers of retail organizations to integrate Square as a payment option that will be customized for the retailer. Square plans to use this service to grow its omnichannel payments platform. It's the only platform that provides a payment solution that spans across online, in-person and mobile options.Square is looking to offer a comprehensive ecosystem of services that is sticky or something that a young entrepreneur or startup might grow to use. These include business loans, payroll services, POS solutions, and now omnichannel commerce. This expansion of its ecosystem makes it attractive but also increases its range of competition to include Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) Magento, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and Wix.com.Its stock is trading at $66.4 with a market capitalization of $28.1 billion. It had climbed to a 52-week high of $101.15 in September last year. Like other tech stocks, its stock had fallen to a 52-week low of $49.82 in December last year."
4249434,103937,2019-03-18T10:32:54-04:00,"Square's differentiation factor seems quite similar to that of its competitors, a white-label software solution and hardware to process card payments.Square is a growth company, using the PE ratio to base an analysis on doesn't work. Let us look into other ratios and numbers and see how they hold up.They have tight margins, and additional growth seems to cost a lot. Is that business style sustainable?","I recently wrote an article about Wirecard (OTCPK:WRCDF), and while looking at their international competition, I stumbled upon Square (SQ). Wirecard's and Square's revenue streams differ strongly geographically. Square's main source of income is the US while Wirecard's primary sources of income are Europe and Asia.Square's free cash flow turned positive over the last three years, their revenue nearly doubled, and their valuation metrics shot up over-proportionally to their growth. In 2016, Square's stock price was nearly flat, in 2017 their stock price doubled, and from 2018 until now it doubled again.With a current stock price of $76.65, the stock is currently overvalued, which we will further discuss in this article. The US economy is in its late-cycle and Square's revenue stream, mainly coming from the US, doesn't offer enough diversification to sustain an economic downturn. Additionally, their differentiation factor is not strong enough to create a big enough moat in the market and create security for their business against current and potential competition in the US market and especially not in the global market. For long-term investors, this stock is currently not recommendable.... is to provide an all-in-one payment system, including hardware for their customers. They offer a white label platform that enables customers to add their products, manage their inventory and more. In Square's annual report, they say that their point of sale software and dedicated hardware differentiates them from their competitors. But a white label software is not a differentiation factor if one looks at the payment as a service landscape. Wirecard, Adyen (ADYEN), Shopkeep, PayPal (PYPL), and many more offer a similar offering to their customers.Source: Slashgear.comSquare has nice looking hardware that works well with their software, but I think that dedicated hardware is redundant for merchants and negatively impact Square's margins. Since most new cards will be NFC enabled and smartphones and tablets have NFC readers already built-in, dedicated hardware won't help to differentiate Square's products.What Square did was to start with a niche market, they enabled small shop owners and restaurants to process credit card payments (the famous little reader that plugs into the iPhone's audio jack). They slowly continued to expand their business from their niche market and created white label software solutions around restaurants and retailers. Their dedication to small businesses is what made them strong, which has translated into their high net promoter score of 70.Since Square is a high-growth company that puts nearly all their income into their business, they have currently negative earnings which makes it hard to interpret their PE ratio. Luckily, there are other indicators like the price to free cash flow ratio or the price to sales ratio that we can use to analyze their stock valuation. Other metrics that I use are expense ratios and cost ratios that help me to understand the health of the company.Free cash flow is the first number I look into because it shows us how much actual cash Square has available to run their business. Young startups are mostly cash flow negative since they use their capital to invest in research and development and the growth of their company, but after a few years, cash flow should turn positive, or the company will fail. To calculate free cash flow, I use operating cash flow and subtract payments for property, plant and equipment from it.Source: Square's Annual ReportsSquare was founded in 2009 and was cash flow negative until 2016. In 2017 and 2018, they became cash flow positive which is a good indicator that their business can generate cash. If we use their recent free cash flow and calculate their price to free cash flow ratio, we get 97 for 2017 and 121 for 2018. What we can see is that in 2018, their free cash flow increased by 130% and at the same time their stock price surged by nearly 300%. The increase in the price to free cash flow ratio means that investors are very bullish about the company and the opportunities they have.Square's general free cash flow trend appears to be positive and shows momentum that will, with high probability, be carried into the future. The bullish behavior indicates that investors expect Square's top- and bottom-line growth to exceed last year's. What concerns me here is that Square is too dependent on the US market and they weren't confronted with global competition in Asia and Europe.To have more data available about the company's earnings and the stock price, we can use the price to sales ratio. Typically, sales let investors see only a very rough picture of the company because the company can manipulate sales numbers in various ways. A company can show high sales growth, but at the expense of much lower profitability, which might not be sustainable if the company has to burn cash for sales growth. In this case, we can look at the price to sales ratio and evaluate their costs and expenses and put the ratio in the right frame.Source: Author's calculationsTheir price to sales ratio surged in 2017 and 2018 and reflects now high enthusiasm from investors that Square will generate consistent high growth over the next few years. The implied growth rate is 50% YoY for the next five years, which is high considering Square's size and international competition. We have to put this growth into perspective and look at their costs and expenses and how they evolved over the last few years.Source: Square Annual ReportsSource: Square Annual ReportsThe two graphs above show Square's cost and expense ratios. I divided each item of their costs and expenses by their total costs and expenses in the respective category. What I am interested in here is consistency in their expenses, and I would like to see their top-line growth to be higher than their expense growth.In Square's cost of revenue, the transaction-based costs make up their most expensive item and tight control over it is critical for them. Transaction-based costs decreased slowly from 2014 to 2017, which is positive. Looking at the transaction-based costs of their competitors like Wirecard, there is potential for Square to further reduce these costs as a percentage of total cost of revenue.For the full transaction-based costs, you have to add the Starbucks (SBUX) items of the years from 2014 to 2016 to the total transaction-based costs to get the whole picture. Their service and subscription costs, as well as hardware costs, increased in the same time frame which I interpret positively since their business offers other sources of income apart from the processing of transactions. Over the same time frame, their revenue increased by 31.14% CAGR, their cost of revenue increased by 26.16% CAGR, and their operating expenses increased by 29.91% CAGR.Source: Square Annual ReportsIn 2018, Square's revenue and expenses nearly equaled each other due to a very positive development over the years. I have no concerns about the fundamental direction of the company. But comparing these numbers with the price that investors are willing to pay for the stock, I find the premium too high. Maintaining a growth rate of nearly 50% for the next five years means that Square has to grow its revenue five-fold over the same time frame.The business seems to be healthy and well managed. A few concerns that I have is that Square's revenue is mainly from the US and has little exposure to the international market. The global market has strong competitors that offer similar products that make Square's differentiation factor, on a global level, small.Their product development expenses are nearly 40% of their total operating expenses, which I find quite high. Nearly all cards will soon be NFC-ready, and a smartphone or tablet will be sufficient, making their hardware unnecessary and expensive on their margins. Competitors like Adyen, Wirecard, and PayPal offer very similar products like Square. Paypal has the advantage that it was one of the first online payment processors that worked over the internet. The first one (in this case PayPal) in the market has a slight edge when it comes to market share. Wirecard has positioned itself as a link between Asia and Europe which makes their income stream safer than that of Square's.Square is a well-managed company with costs and expenses growing slower than revenue. I think that we will soon see positive earnings. They offer attractive products for restaurants and merchants.The entry barriers into the payment as a service market are quite small, and switching costs are hard to establish for Square. Their revenue comes mainly from the US, and if there will be economic hardship, Square's dependency on the US market will hurt their income. When Square expands more globally, future revenue streams can be even more expensive, because of more competition in the international market. These costs will push down their margins.The price investors are willing to pay is quite high no matter which valuation metric you choose to analyze. Square's price to sales ratio is at an all-time high and investors are expecting 50% YoY revenue growth over the next five years. They have to quintuple their revenue in the next five years, and considering that we are already in the 10th year of the economic expansion in the US, the chances are high that economic hardship will occur.Their free cash flow is now positive, which underlines my point that management is building a fundamentally strong company here. Nevertheless, their price to free cash flow ratio is currently at 121, and it increased over-proportionally to actual free cash flow growth in the last year.Investors are very bullish about Square and pushed the premium too high for me to consider it as a good investment.If you liked this article, feel free to click the follow button.I always welcome constructive criticism and open discussions.

The principles are more qualitative than quantitative and I think that is appropriate for growth stocks. The results of the Potential Multibaggers have been excellent, beating the market by more than 20%. So, the theory works.A lot of them are highly scalable and quantitative ratios do not tend to find the winners. Amazon (AMZN) has never been a buy if you looked at quantitative ratios, and neither were Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA) or almost all other growth stocks. For people who are not convinced: Yahoo! would have won over Alphabet/Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) any time if you would have looked at measurable ratios. But we all know how that turned out.The basic philosophy of the Potential Multibaggers portfolio is that stocks can only go down by 100%, but they can go up by 1000s of percentages. A few big winners are more than enough to compensate for quite a few losers and still make you beat the index. Of course, because these are growth stocks and not megacaps, the stocks in the portfolio of Potential Multibaggers will be quite volatile by nature. You should have the stomach to sit out the big swings and concentrate on the only period that matters for investing: the very long term.In the articles in this series, I pick stocks that I believe to have the potential to become multibaggers over the course of years. These are no short-term plays, but stocks to hold in your portfolio for decades. All of them have the potential to be ten-baggers or more. And exactly that element had kept me from writing about the pick that I am going to present you in this article.The ninth pick in this series is Square (SQ). (Source)Square has been a red hot stock for a while now. I have it in my portfolio since February 2017 and it has been a good performer: I am up 333% on my initial buying price, but way less from my average price since I have been averaging up to around $58. This is the price evolution over the last five years:Data by YChartsAlthough I started this series in May of 2017 and have picked eight stocks so far, for one reason or the other I thought Square was not a Potential Multibagger. I thought it was already too big. But although Square's market cap is more than $30B now, I have been convinced by the last earnings call that Square still can be a Potential Multibagger, which means that I see the potential for Square to grow to $300B over time. That is a lot more difficult than growing from $2B to $20B but I really am convinced that Cash App is a game-changer for Square and that it can propel the company to the giant cap category over time.After the earnings were released on February, 27, Square fell by 6.66% after-market, as if Satan himself had a hand in it. This is what the stock price has done since the earnings:Data by YChartsNot a huge drop, but down anyway. I have made use of the opportunity to buy a few shares again, averaging up to $58. I consider Square as a core holding and from now on a Potential Multibagger as well. This is by far the biggest Potential Multibagger, which could make it somewhat less volatile than picks like Shopify (SHOP), Baozun (BZUN), Weibo (WB) or Momo (MOMO).The fact that the stock initially went down and now again was not because of the earnings release, the results were good, but because of the guidance for next year, which was seen as weak. In this article, we analyze the earnings, look at the guidance and evaluate the long-term perspectives of Square. Then we will look at the traits of a Potential Multibagger and apply them to Square.To be clear from the start: I was impressed by the earnings of Square. The Q4 Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.14, beating estimates by $0.01; The GAAP EPS of -$0.07 beat by $0.01 too. I have been saying for a while that I don't care that much for what I call the expectations game. Because it is really a game: hitting, beating or missing. There is enough financial trickery to bend the numbers in your advantage, even with GAAP. How about share buybacks, for example?But that doesn't mean earnings results are not important. But I look behind the headlines of both the expectations game and the guidance game. Because the guidance game that is also included in earnings: being conservative and guiding low is often seen as weakness, which I think is ridiculous. I like an under-promising, over-delivering management.What I do focus on depends on the kind of company that releases earnings. Square is still growing at an insane rate and for growing companies, the most important part is growing revenue, because that mostly tells you if the company is taking market share. And the revenue growth for Square was impressive: it went up by 64.2% YoY to $464.25M. That is huge growth and that is what is important for Square. And before you shout: 'Acquisitions! Weebly, Zesty!': excluding acquisitions, the revenue growth was still a jaw-dropping 53%.But what did investors react to after the earnings release? To earnings, profitability. The guidance there was weaker than expected: $0.06 to $0.08, while analysts were expecting $0.12. One analyst, Mark Palmer of BTIG, gave another sell advice, citing higher spending and weaker earnings guidance. Yawn. If you want profitability, don't buy growth stocks, buy a dividend aristocrat or so. By the way, that analyst has brought out advice to sell from $38.The proof of the shortsightedness of analysts? Square sees the FY2019 earnings coming in at $0.74 to $0.78 cents, exceeding the consensus of $0.70. But still, only the focus on Q1 2019 guidance. Sigh...What I find important for a growth company is revenue growth guidance and that was fine: the Q1 2019 revenue was guided between $472M and $482M (consensus of $474.0M), up from $307M in Q1 2018, growing at 55% midpoint. Those are huge growth projections. I expect these numbers to come down a bit over time, due to the law of big numbers. I have had remarks about that law from readers, who may be mathematicians, scientists or programmers, and yeah, I know that there is a law of big number in probability and statistics too, but in finance, the law of big numbers means:(Source: Investopedia)So the growth will have to come down a bit eventually. That will probably be another reason for analysts to bring down Square. But, hey, I don't care. I love it when they bring down the stock price of excellent companies.Until now, Square has been mainly focusing on products for businesses and that still is where Square makes most of its money. But businesses are not the end game for Square.Where Square is outshining its competitors is that its products are all very tightly interconnected into a flexible ecosystem. Clients can use Square's products all together and it makes sense to combine them: accepting payment cards, using Square installments to split big sums into smaller installments with Square Installments, Square Capital for lending services, the Cash Card, the Square Payroll to pay your employees etc.As Jack Dorsey, Square's famous CEO, said on the Q4 2018 earnings call, this ecosystem also attracts developers:So the fact that the ecosystem is so strong attracts more developers... which will make the ecosystem even stronger. It is a virtuous circle that bodes very well for Square's future.I think little people will dispute the fact that Square is very successful. But despite this huge success, the company only has a few million SMBs as its customers. I write a few million because the most recent number I could find was 2 million at the end of 2017. Maybe a reader has more recent information?Investing in growth stocks is often projecting and imagining. Now try to imagine that Square could create a similar interconnected ecosystem of products for consumers as they have done that for merchants. Well, Square has actually started doing that and therefore I think the company is still in the early stage of its development.What do I mean by 'Square has actually started doing that'? Square has developed Cash App, which is basically a mobile app that allows you to transfer money, mostly smaller amounts, to each other via the app or via e-mail. Cash App is, as far as I know, the only app that you can use to pay with bitcoin as well.(logo Cash App, source)From the app, you can use a Cash Card, basically a Visa card, to withdraw the money from an ATM or you can transfer it to your bank account. The Cash Card is a black card that looks pretty cool. By the way, there is a trend of creatively customizing the cards.(Cash Card, source)In August 2018, Square's Cash App surpassed the number of downloads of PayPal's (PYPL) Venmo, which was seen before as the big winner in the space. And for 2018, the number of downloads were impressive. Cash App was in the top 20 of free downloadable apps of 2018:(From the Q4 2018 earnings call slides)But downloading an app is not using it yet, of course. Last year the Cash App had 7 million users. Now, on the last earnings release, it was announced that the app had more than 15 million users. And users means MAUs in this case, or Monthly Active Users. Those are ordinary people, not just SMBs (Small and Midsize Businesses).So the Cash App is a great way to go to consumers directly. Square wants to get into the consumer financial services, not just the merchants', where they make the bulk of their money right now.Former CFO Sarah Friar said to CNBC:(Former Square CFO Sarah Friar, source)This is a major paradigm shift for Square. The consumer market is so much bigger than only SMBs. And, mind you, Square wants both SMBs and consumers and larger customers. CEO Jack Dorsey on the earnings call:So that may be the focus for the next few years. But for the longer term, I see Square transitioning to the consumers' market too. That means there is huge potential: savings accounts, personal lending, a platform to make your investments etc. Square could be the alternative to banks that a lot of people have been hoping for since banks have lost their solid reputation in the financial crisis of 2008-2009. And you can see that in the very low numbers of satisfied customers of banks:With the Cash App user base growing so fast, this opens huge opportunities for the long term. The new CFO Amrita Ahuja on the earnings call:(bold and italic: FGTV)The Cash App probably still loses money now. There is some monetization, but Square spends a lot on promoting the app. And I think this is a good idea. Growth is all that matters right now. Getting consumers on board of the Square platform is much more important than profitability right now. Later on, these consumers can be targeted to cross-sell other products.I am not sure investors or analysts see the full potential that Square has in this area. Or maybe they see it, but it is too much long-term thinking for them.For my Potential Multibaggers, I have a set of qualities that I look for. Let's look if Square has got the qualities of a Potential Multibagger.Now, this may seem petty, but companies that have ideas that they can articulate well and make investors enthusiastic about will probably have the same conviction in trying to win their customers. It is always great if you can summarize what the company does in one sentence that everybody understands. For Square, I think that after this earnings call, with the huge growth of the Cash App and the remarks of the management, you could easily say: 'Square, the bank of the future.'Square has reapplied for a banking license. The fact that it takes so long (the first application was already in 2017) is just because the technology and infrastructure of Square as a 'bank' is so new for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the institute that grants the licenses.One of the most valuable aspects of growth stocks is having a visionary leader, someone with exceptional qualities who knows where he or she has to steer his or her company to surf the wave to the future. I especially, but not exclusively, like founder CEOs, since they have had the drive and the capacities to start something and to make their baby big. Another great asset is if they are great communicators since they can probably bring their message across both to the (financial) media and their team.Do we really have to talk about this for Square? Square's CEO is Jack Dorsey, one of the most visionary CEOs of our time.(Jack Dorsey, source)Jack Dorsey first developed open source dispatching software, some of which is still used today by taxi companies, then founded Twitter (TWTR) and in 2009 Square. So yes, the man knows a thing or two about communication.He is sometimes criticized by both Twitter and Square shareholders that he doesn't focus on one company. But look at almost all big visionary CEOs of this time: they all have multiple companies. Jeff Bezos also has Blue Origin besides Amazon (AMZN). And the Washington Post. And then we don't count the numerous companies inside Amazon: Audible, Goodreads, Zappos, Wholefoods etc.Elon Musk? The same thing, as you probably know: Tesla (TSLA), SolarCity (incorporated in Tesla now), Space X. Oh and NeuraLink, The Boring Company, and all of his other projects. And that was after selling PayPal (PYPL) of course.Steve Jobs? Apple (AAPL) and Pixar, which was then later acquired by Apple.Despite his years of experience, Jack Dorsey is still only 42, which means he can be CEO of Square for decades to come.A growth stock must be innovating. If the company doesn't innovate, it won't have growth. The Austrian-American economist Joseph Schumpeter, one of the most influential economists ever, coined the term ""creative destruction"" in 1942. In ""Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy,"" he defined it as the:For Square, this is a reality, more than for maybe any company of its size. The products that have launched in the last five years now contribute to more than half of the total revenue, which you mostly only see in companies that are much smaller than Square already is:(Source: Q4 2018 earnings slides)So, there is no doubt that Square keeps innovating. And it also innovates in different areas: food delivery with Caviar, corporate catering with Zesty and web hosting for online shops with Weebly.Mostly I'm a buy-and-hold investor. In my bio here on SA, there is the sentence that I think defines me very well: I don't think in years but rather in decades. As a consequence, I pick stocks of companies that have a vision for the future and that I believe will thrive over the next decade(s). I know that predicting is hard, especially about the future, but what I mean is: I want the company in the sweet spot of what I think is a new evolution in a market or submarket, preferably, of course, a secular trend.Square is certainly such a stock. It invests in its fintech and does that for the very long term. There has been much talk about the cashless society, but I think we are only in the very first inning here.As I have already mentioned, the end goal for Square is the consumer market and banking services. But the approach is step by step and with a clear destination, like only a company with a long-term vision can.I want double-digit growth over the next five years because otherwise, it is impossible to evolve from a Potential Multibagger to a real multibagger. Finviz.com expects 50% EPS growth for Square over the next five years. This is the expectation that FAST Graphs gives:As you can see from the graph, Square's EPS is expected to grow exponentially over the next few years. For 2022, there is an expectation of 26% but that is still far away. The conclusion is that Square really will continue to grow enormously. And that is even without the introduction of new products or acquisitions.This is the last point on the checklist for potential multibaggers. Stocks that want to be picked as a potential multibagger should have as much as possible of what I call the three Os: overachieving, owning, and overdelivering.OverachievingBeing the CEO of two multibillion companies? I call that overachieving. Taking on PayPal's Venmo with Cash App, even if PayPal has a market cap of more than $110B? I call that overachieving. Trying to become the new banking service, undercutting banks who have had the monopoly for this for centuries? That is overachieving Squared.OwningI like executives that have skin in the game. If the stock does well, they will do well financially too. Their interests and that of the stockholder are aligned.According to Forbes, Jack Dorsey owns more than 60 million shares of Square, good for 85% of his wealth. His 2% stake in Twitter is responsible for just 11% of his wealth, which I also think is telling.According to Square's most recent SEC filing, there were 405.731M shares outstanding for Square. If this information is correct, Dorsey owns almost 15% of Square. That is extraordinary but also typical for the best founders-owners of this time. Jeff Bezos still owns about 10% of Amazon and Elon Musk even has a stake of more than 20% in Tesla.But Dorsey also did something extraordinary for Square. In 2013, he gave 10% of his stake in Square back to the company. 10% of his shares was about 3% of the whole company then since Dorsey owned about 30% of Square. The reason: he wanted to thank his team but without diluting the owners. Just to give you an idea: that stake was worth around $100M then and would be worth almost $1B now. Those kinds of gestures create loyal and motivated employees, of course.Over-deliveringIf you look at the growth in the stock price of Square, I surely would say that this is over-delivering already. Here is the graph of Square's stock price since its IPO compared to the S&P 500:Data by YChartsI have stated several times, though, that the stock price doesn't tell anything on its own. It is just a barometer of the stock market's sentiment but doesn't always tell you that much about the company behind the stock. You can read more about this in my previous article, 7 Suggestions For When Your Stocks Fall.At this moment, Square's stock price has fallen 26.5% from its top at $101.15 at the beginning of November 2018. But after the Cash App results were so good, I wouldn't be surprised that it surpasses $100 fairly soon again.But Square is also an over-deliverer on earnings, not just on stock price performance. These are the last four quarters, for example:(Source: Seeking Alpha)This is the point that most value investors have their doubts about. They look at all kinds of ratios and say the stock is expensive. But look at all the great companies of our time, they all are or were very expensive if you just looked from traditional ratios such as P/E: Amazon, Tesla, Netflix (NFLX), Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) (before it became Alphabet), Facebook (FB)... Ratios just don't matter that much as qualitative elements for growth stocks.With a P/S ratio of 9.5, Square is certainly not extremely expensive for a high-growth stock. Just to compare: Okta (OKTA) stands at 25 and Zscaler (ZS) at 30, for example. That doesn't mean I don't like these stocks, to the contrary: I own both of them, but Square has a huge potential for expanding and high-profit margins over the long term too. Just think of the potential Square has internationally, where it has barely scratched the surface.I know you cannot really compare between different industries, so let's do it in (more or less) the same sector: fintech. Visa (V) P/S: 15, Mastercard's (MA): 15. PayPal is valued at a P/S of 7.3. So, Square may actually be relatively moderately valued. But again: the companies are not identical and ratios are always relative, so on its own, this doesn't mean all that much. Qualitative research stays the most important to me.I think Square might be a Potential Multibagger over time, despite the fact that it has already a market cap of more than $30B.If you see the huge potential of the company as a sort of alternative for traditional banks, I think it might become one of those mega-companies everybody knows, like Visa or Mastercard. With the drop after earnings, I have added again to my position and I consider Square as a core holding for my portfolio, probably for decades.This was the ninth installment of the Potential Multibaggers series. More episodes will follow. If you don't want to miss those, feel free to hit the follow button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4246286,22148,2019-03-04T18:15:33-05:00,Square continues to generate substantial growth.The mobile payments company uses a lot of share dilution to generate their high growth rates.Even aggressive growth rates in the next couple of years still leaves the stock trading at an absurd 70x '20 EPS estimates.,"For Q4, Square (SQ) generated the results that will keep most people bullish, but the guidance wasn't anywhere close to enough to make the stock exciting near $80. The $40 billion market cap for a company with a small revenue base and decelerating revenue growth remains problematic for the stock. The results were nowhere close to strong enough to alter my negative view on Square.Image Source: Square websiteThe biggest problem for any momentum stock is decelerating growth. Square faces a scenario where growth will fall off a cliff in the next year.The key to the revenue decelerating story is that Square doesn't appear to have another card up its sleeves to further boost growth whether on an organic basis or not. The fintech company guided to Q1 revenue growth of 55% after reaching 64% in Q4. The growth rate is expected to further decelerate in 2019 to only 41% suggesting end of year growth rates in the low 30s%.Source: Square Q4'18 Shareholder LetterAs one can see from the below stock chart over the last few years, Square trades based on the trend of revenue growth. Following the 2015 IPO, the stock failed to see any rally as questions mounted on growth. As the company started ramping up new products and revenue growth accelerated, the stock burst higher going from $10 to over $100 in less than two years.Data by YChartsThe big hiccup is that the stock, not surprisingly, hit a wall as the growth rate stalled and has now started heading down. A analyst forecast of going from the 60% growth rate to only 30% is a substantial deceleration in a matter of quarters.Another part of the equation entering the story is the bottom line as Square is set to top $2 billion in revenues in 2019. The fintech is already highly profitable questioning whether the upside margin expansion actually exists to the extent the market projects.The company spends very aggressively on research and development with most of the costs hidden via the use of stock-based compensation. In the latest quarter, Square took a $41 million hit for product development costs alone and $59 million for the company as a whole.Source: Square Q4'18 Shareholder LetterWhile my investment philosophy prefers excluding SBC from EPS calculations, analyzing a stock become dangerous when looking at EBITDA numbers that don't factor into per share measures. Square is a massive spender on stock options to employees causing the average diluted share count to surge from 427 million last year to 479 million in 2018. The share count topped 488 million in Q4. These hidden costs don't always so up in the financial metrics reviewed by shareholders, but it's a prime reason that Square appears a lot more attractive to investors looking at growth metrics and not valuation metrics.In comparison to PayPal (PYPL), Square spends a substantially larger amount of GAAP expenses on R&D as a percentage of revenues. In fact, PayPal has about 8x the revenues and only spends double on R&D placing Square at double the R&D expense level to revenues.Data by YChartsAs shown above, a big portion of those expenses go towards SBC that are hidden in EBITDA calculations and of course not a part of the revenue growth metric that makes the momentum trade work so well.When looking at the P/E multiple, Square trades at a substantially higher multiple than PayPal. As revenue growth slows down, Square won't deserve to trade at a such substantial multiple in comparison to a peer like PayPal.Data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that Square isn't on pace to generate enough growth to justify the massive stock valuation, greatly boosted by rampant stock option issuance. The problem with the stock at an already stretched valuation is justifying even higher prices that would be needed to reward shareholders.Decelerating revenue growth in 2019 will hold lead to an under performing year for Square."
4245292,104905,2019-02-28T13:27:24-05:00,"The stock sold off 6% after its Q4 earnings release, missing analyst expectations of Q1 adjusted EPS guidance and issuing soft top-line growth guidance for the full-year 2019.
        You could also lament that the company stopped accelerating adjusted revenue growth in Q4, a trend that has been ongoing since Q1 2017.
        But the company reported excellent numbers, growing adjusted revenue by 64%, subscription and services revenue by 146%, and adjusted EBITDA by 98% suggesting that the business is firing on all cylinders.
        Square is improving its ecosystem which is evidenced by the huge success of newer product offerings and their continued output of innovative new functionalities.
        This article discusses all you need to know about Square's Q4 2018 earnings report. Shares are a buy.","Square's (SQ) stock sold off 6% after the earnings release, missing analyst expectations of Q1 adjusted EPS guidance and issuing soft top-line growth guidance for the full-year 2019. With their lofty valuation – a real evergreen subject among hyper-growth companies – and volatile shares, investors could worry if slowing growth and lower profitability outlook could mean tough times ahead for Square. However, looking at the earnings numbers, there is nothing really to worry about. Square just reported a great quarter in Q4 2018. Investors can expect strong business and share price performance going forward.Since Square (SQ) reported Q3 earnings in early November the stock has been on an up and down ride, falling from the low $80s to around $50 and up again to the mid $70s. All of that after reaching the $100 mark at the end of September.What happened with Square's business during that time? Well, first of all, the stock was on a huge tear over the summer with lots of enthusiasm baked into the stock – probably too much. Then, the company announced that their well-liked CFO, Sarah Friar, would leave the company to become the CEO of a smaller private company called Nextdoor. It didn't make things better when Square's CEO, Jack Dorsey, decided to abandon his company for a meditation retreat in the South Pacific. It took Square until early January to announce their new CFO, Amrita Ahuja, former CFO at Blizzard Entertainment (ATVI). In the meantime, the overall market saw one of the biggest drops in recent memory, especially hurting the tech-sector. In Square's case, recession fears were perceived even more troubling since the company's small business customer base was believed to be more vulnerable during economic hardship, which would reflect back on Square.What is so fascinating about Square's recent stock price volatility is how quick perception can change: In the summer of 2018, the market believed that Square, led by a visionary founder-CEO, would take over the world by disrupting banking from the bottom-up and was surely on its way to becoming an international juggernaut. Nothing could stop them. Fast forward a couple of months and the market looked at an eccentric and distracted CEO, who was losing grip on his management team and was looking at an economy that was surely headed towards a recession – an event that would severely hurt this bearly profitable company. All of a sudden Square's business looked fragile, the competitive landscape threatening, and their future prospects uncertain.What is interesting, though, is that the company never really saw any changes in their actual business, other than continued progress in operational performance and the addition of new product features, like their free debit card for business or improvements to their payroll app.Is it only a funny coincidence that the stock today is trading approximately around the level it was trading in mid-to-late August before their huge run-up, sharp downturn, and quick recovery? And where does that leave us looking forward? Will the stock continue to climb or could we see another decline?The company just issued a typical beat and raise quarter, clocking in 64% yoy-growth in adjusted revenue, 97.6% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 75% growth in adjusted EPS – all metrics handily beating prior guidance. Subscription and services-based revenue – their big growth motor – was $194 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 (up 144% yoy), and $592 million for the full year of 2018 (up 134% yoy). This recurring and high margin subscription and service revenue represented 37% of adjusted revenue in 2018, up from 25.6% in 2017, and 11.1% in 2016. Now, if you were to find a hair or two in the soup of an amazing quarterly earnings report, it would have to be conservative guidance and a slight growth deceleration from the previous quarter. Actually, the company broke a trend that has been ongoing for quite some time: Since Q1 2017 the company has accelerated its quarterly adjusted revenue yoy-growth every time. From 39.7% in Q1 2017 to 40.4%, 44.4%, 47.4%, 50.5%, 60.4%, and 67.7% in Q3 2018. The 64% growth in Q4 2018 represents the first time in a long time that the company didn't accelerate growth. You can see this slight growth deceleration from Q3 2018 basically among all the key metrics. Should this broken trend worry investors? I think not. While I believe that much of their strong share price appreciation in the last two years was a result of rapidly accelerating growth rates, I don't think that the share price will reverse because of a coming deceleration in growth rates. This company is still growing at such high rates (north of 60%!) at such a big scale (they just passed $1.5 billion in TTM adjusted revenue) that you had to expect the growth acceleration at some point. That's what we are seeing now, nothing more.But what about their guidance? As I wrote in a previous article about Twilio (TWLO), it's fashionable among growth companies today to give conservative guidance that can easily be crush later on, especially on the top-line. Square is one of the main disciples of this low-ball-estimation-school. Looking back a couple of quarters, the company guided 60.3% growth in adjusted revenue for Q3 2018 and came in at 67.7% (+7.4%). For Q4 2018 the company guided for 59.4% adjusted revenue growth and made 64% (+4.6%). For Q1 2019 Square is guiding $482 million adjusted revenue and 57% growth (using the top range of guidance) which should put the company above 60% growth again at the end of the day.Conservatism in guidance is even more apparent when looking at full year guidance. The company sees adjusted revenue growth of ""only"" 41.8% in 2019, which would obviously be a great growth number in itself (management called it ""remarkable given our scale"", which it is), but for Square, it simply makes no sense. If the company grew 57% yoy in Q1 2019 their average growth rate in the remaining three quarters of 2019 would have to drop to around 38% to get the company to a full-year 2019 growth rate of 41.8%. It's hard to see that really happening. Let me also remind investors that in Q4 2017 the company actually guided for 35% yoy-growth in 2018 at the high end of the range. Twelve months later and we are looking at over 61% yoy-growth in 2018. Some companies simply like to raise their full-year guidance every quarter of the year. Understanding this fact, a more realistic growth rate for 2019 would probably be somewhere between 55% and 60%. If weak guidance makes you think about selling shares, you should really think again.For the last two quarters, the strong interest of analysts in EBITDA margin expansion has been quite fascinating. In the Q3 earnings call, one analyst mentioned an ""unwritten contract"" between management and investors to deliver less EBITDA margin expansion when higher revenue growth is achieved and, conversely, more EBITDA margin expansion if the growth were to slow a bit. Since the company, already back then, guided for greater than 40% adjusted revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion similar to 2018, some analysts took that as a breach of that unwritten contract. However, as I just mentioned, you cannot look at 2019 guidance and think, ""yes, that's reasonable"", it simply isn't. In that vein, similar margin expansion to 2018 just means business as usual.  In yesterday's earnings call, EBITDA margin was again very popular, with three questions being raised about the subject. While the company explained that Q1 typically is seasonally slower quarter than Q4 and that the company usually invests more at the beginning of a new year, the key takeaway here is that management reiterated their long-term EBITDA margin goal of 35%-40% but still prioritizes top-line growth to deliver the maximum absolute dollar profits in the future. That sounds like a very sensible strategy. Square raised EBITDA margin from 8% in 2016 to 14% in 2017, 16.1% in 2018, and now expects 18.4% for 2019. EBITDA margin expansion might be too slow for some analyst's liking but it's still a visible trend. The company also reported 82% gross margin (on an adjusted revenue basis) for the fourth quarter and for the full-year 2018. Even though that's slightly down from 85% in 2017 and 84% in 2016, their long-term EBITDA margin goal seems very attainable.Having said all that, it doesn't make a lot of sense to see shares trading down on the headline of missed Q1 adjusted EPS guidance estimates by 4-6 cents, especially, since the company beat full-year adjusted EPS guidance estimates by 4-8 cents. But it really doesn't matter. Square's management is building this company for the long-term. Who cares, if they miss on accounting profit estimates for a quarter?Square's focus is to create great products and scale them to increase the value of their ecosystem, customers value, and, ultimately, shareholder value. CEO Jack Dorsey reminded investors again that their ecosystem is the core differentiator for Square in the market. For example, while they have seen some customers moving to larger competitors recently, lured in by aggressive pricing, they typically returned right back to Square after some months. The reasons for these quick comebacks are the quality of Square's software, its simplicity, their many product offerings and the seamless pairing with their hardware – in short: their ecosystem. Ecosystems are creating durable customer relationships and, therefore, are very sticky. To keep your ecosystem healthy and justify charging premium prices you have to invest in it. That's what Square is doing, and it's paying off.Source: Q4 2018 Shareholder Letter, square.com/investors.Here are some nuggets from the earnings report regarding products:As already mentioned, shares have been on a volatile ride in the recent past and are trading considerably below their all-time-high valuation levels. Still, historically shares are not cheap:Now, this graph obviously uses total revenues for the EV/S calculation which in my opinion shouldn't be used for evaluating Square's shares. However, it is a helpful illustration and approximation of the development in valuation, so it's worth a look.Square should really be valued based on adjusted revenues. As of this writing, at $74.46 in pre-market trading, with 488 million shares outstanding and a net cash position of roughly $260 million, the EV amounts to approximately $36 billion. Thus, at approximately $1.6 billion TTM adjusted revenue, the company is trading at a TTM EV/S ratio of 22.5. Without counting forward share dilution, which the company doesn't provide guidance for, and a calculated 2019 growth rate of 55% the forward EV/S ratio drops to 14.5.This is not cheap but given the excellent business execution, long-term industry tailwinds (I didn't mention the phrase ""war on cash"" yet, did I?), enormous TAM, and future profitability outlook, I think the current after earnings share price drop – if it holds – is a good opportunity to add to or open a new position. Investors shouldn't worry over missed EPS guidance estimates, conservative top-line growth guidance, slight growth deceleration, or the current high valuation but rather focus on Square's strong long-term outlook. Square remains a buy in my opinion.If you like what you just read, consider following me so you get notified when my new articles come out and you can read them before they hit the paywall.

4245210,71685,2019-02-28T12:07:37-05:00,"Square's stock is falling after reporting strong results.The outlook for the company remains strong, and short-term challenges will not last.The technical chart continues to point to a stock on the rise.","Square's (SQ) stock is falling a bit following the fourth quarter results, but the pullback is likely not to last. The technical chart suggests that there's a healthy level of support in the stock around $74 and that there was some bullish options betting going into the results.The results themselves were robust, with the only disappointment coming in first quarter earnings growth. But the revenue and earnings growth for the year is substantial and impressive.The company's guidance for the first quarter was for $477 million at the mid-point, while earnings guidance came in at $0.07 at the mid-point. According to YCharts, consensus analysts’ estimates had been for earnings of about $0.11 per share, on revenue of approximately $474 million. It would suggest that margins are taking a bit of a hit.However, the full-year guidance would suggest that whatever hit margins may have in the first quarter will not last. That is because revenue guidance for the full year is at $2.235 billion at the mid-point vs. analysts’ estimates of $2.25 billion, basically in-line. Additionally, earnings guidance is for $0.76 at the mid-point vs. analysts’ estimates of $0.71. It would seem at the very the very least that margins will begin to expand starting in the second quarter.It's also worth noting that Square has topped analysts revenue estimates eight quarters in a row going back to the first quarter of 2017. It would at that very least suggest that Square tends to give conservative guidance. Additionally, the company has topped analysts earnings estimates eight quarters in a row as well. The technical chart continues to point to a stock that will rise, not fall. The stock is holding technical support in the $74 to $75 region, which is critical to the stock rising in the future. Additionally, the uptrend in the stock continues to hold strong as well and also points to a stock rising. However, should the stock fall below that support zone, the shares could drop to around $65.50.Additionally, the relative strength index continues to point to the stock rising as well. Meanwhile, volume has thinned out as the stock price has increased which would suggest that the number of sellers is likely waning. Additionally, the volume at a price, - the volume on the right hand side of the chart, would suggest that most of the heavy lifting for the stock to rise further has been worked through at lower levels.Open interest levels for Square continue to increase. The $83 calls for expiration on March 15 have increased by nearly 5,000 contracts. According to data from Trade Alert, those calls were traded on the ask side suggesting they were bought. For a buyer of these calls to earn a profit the stock would need to rise to roughly $84 by expiration. This comes in addition to the bullish options betting I had observed before the results at the March $80 calls, in the article Square's Stock May Jump Following Its ResultsThe decline in Square from a fundamental and technical point of view appears to be something that's likely not to last. The fundamental outlook for the business continues to look as if it's progressing nicely. The short-term impact from higher costs appear to be temporary. The company also has a very good ability it would seem to manage investor expectations.The one knock that continues to go against Square is its valuation, but as long as the company continues to deliver significant growth, that valuation will continue to work for the stock."

Click here to find out more »Square, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) is currently valued at around $30 billion. It is my view that the price of SQ has significantly diverged from its true value and currently carries considerable downside risk. Square, Inc. has yet to report any significant operating income, the growth rate of liabilities is outpacing the growth rate of assets (current and long term) and growing competition from established merchant service providers may constitute headwinds for future valuation growth. The continual operating losses are being fueled by exponentially increasing stock-based compensation. This approach to compensation dilutes the current pool of outstanding shares, motivates executives to increase the price in the short run, despite possible negative implications on long run value, and can also add considerable selling pressure.When a firm aggressively compensates with options or by granting restricted stock to employees, as is the case with Square, Inc., it hurts all current equity holders. The real economic cost associated with such compensation is often overlooked, but, it goes without saying that as the level of options and grants increase, as does the total of outstanding shares. Existing equity gets diluted and each share is entitled to a little less. In theory, this reflects negatively on the price per share of Square over time. In the short run however, there is incentive for executives to push the price as high as possible before their eventual liquidation.Take a look through any of Square, Inc.’s shareholder letters, and you will quickly notice financial metrics that have been adjusted to bolster their GAAP counterparts. Below is page one of Square's latest letter to shareholders:Source: Square Investor Relations - Q3 2018 Shareholder LetterIt is worth noting that they have highlighted ‘adjusted EBITDA’, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses, as if they do not represent a real economic cost to the firm. For the nine months ended September 2018, Square, Inc. reported a GAAP operating loss of $33.5 million and $41.2 million for the same period a year prior. Take away stock-based compensation and Square, Inc. would have reported a GAAP operating income of $124.5 million for the nine months ended September 2018 and $70 million for the same period a year earlier. - Warren Buffett (2015 Berkshire Hathaway letter to shareholders)Source: Square Investor Relations - Q3 2018 Shareholder LetterOver the past 6 months, CEO Jack Dorsey, received, and subsequently sold, 103,035 shares of SQ every week. Along with diluting existing shares, this creates unwarranted downward pressure on the stock’s price. At an average of $70 per share, that is approximately $7.2 million USD per week being absorbed by open market participants to cover the wage of one executive. This recurring $7.2 million expense, and others like it, represent zero cost to the firm though, according to their adjusted earnings.Stock-based compensation at Square has been on the rise ever since the company went public in late 2015. In 2016, stock-based compensation totaled $139 million. In 2017, stock-based compensation grew by ~12% to $156 million. During the nine months ended September 2018, stock-based compensation had already reached $158 million, up ~42% from the same period a year prior. Net income grew by $37 million, while stock-based compensation grew by $46 million during the same period. With Square, Inc. set to release 2018 Q4 numbers in late February, expect a continuation of this trend to emerge.Despite reporting a positive net income in Q3, which was due to the revaluation of an investment in Eventbrite (NYSE:EB), Square continues to struggle financially, with the growth rate of liabilities outpacing the growth rate of assets (current and long term):Data compiled by myself from Square, Inc.'s quarterly and annual reports With competitors such as Chase Merchant Services (the merchant services subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank (NYSE: JPM) who took over processing payments for Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) when Square's deal expired, a deal in which Square lost a substantial amount of money), PayPal Here (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Shopify POS (NYSE: SHOP) all battling for market share, Square, Inc. has a challenging road ahead. Future growth will likely depend on sustainable competitive advantages, which Square currently does not have.Although aggressively ramping up options and grants is not the conventional path to sustainable growth, Jack Dorsey, who is also CEO of Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), has navigated these waters before. During the first four years of Twitter being public, they had seemingly high stock-based compensation expenses, but managed to eventually turn a profit and drastically lower these costs. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that management could be following a similar path here and the growth of these expenses could be reduced in the future.If management at Square, Inc. is unable to curb their addiction to stock-based compensation though, it could continue to pose a problem for current investors and Square's financials. This cavalier approach to stock-based compensation is not sustainable in the long run and should raise concern if it continues to grow at this pace. While it's possible Square turns things around in the short run, I expect a significant retracement in the price of SQ before any notable improvements are made."
4236818,22148,2019-01-30T16:35:53-05:00,Square faces a year of decelerating revenue growth that will hold the stock back.The elevated total growth in Q3 will make comps in 2019 tough.The market will increasingly look at high margins as a negative for long-term growth.The stock won't trade above 15x '19 sales estimates based on these metrics.,"A lot of data continues pointing to Square (SQ) reaching peak organic growth right when the stock peaked over $100. The problem with stock momentum derived by revenue growth is that eventually that trend reverses. The biggest mistake an investor can make is to view the downside from the peak as an opportunity rather than reviewing the fair price of the related stock.Image Source: Square websiteMy investment thesis warned on multiple occasions that the stock was insanely priced above $70 and offered limited long-term upside above $100. The problem for shareholders is that the stock got hit on January 29 due to Raymond James targeting that thesis as a reason Square will struggle in 2019. Per analyst John Davis (via Barron's):The analyst placed a $56 target on the stock based on a $0.99 EPS goal for 2020. The problem for investors is that the stock ended down 10% for the day and is now down 30% from the $101 high back in September. Even with that low price target, the stock trades at nearly 57x updated EPS estimates.One needed to act on the knowledge of peaking organic growth before the concept became widely disseminated like now. The stock trading back down to $70 looks technically broken with the analyst likely correct that the $50s are retested.One might even be reminded that the well-respected CFO Sarah Friar announced her resignation on October 10 following the quarter where Raymond James proclaims as the peak organic growth. At the time, my suspicions were that the now ex-CFO saw a peak opportunity to exit on the highs.The Raymond James analyst focused on organic growth, but my view is that the market gets trapped into a total growth view. In the below chart, Square struggled around $10 following the IPO as the quarterly revenue YoY growth rates were falling. The stock surged as revenue growth surged in 2017 and 2018.Data by YChartsPart of this growth rate was fueled by acquisitions that just boosted revenues in Q3 by $25 million and contributed a large part to the climax peak at $100. The Weebly and Zesty acquisitions boosted Q3 growth rates by 12 percentage points in the quarter helping accelerate revenue growth to 68%.The above chart only captures gross revenues and not the adjusted revenues so the stated growth rate is listed at 50.8%, not the actual 68%. The chart does accurately capture the important trend. As the below table shows, growth rate trends will slow meaningfully with 2019 only forecast to grow at 43%.Source: Yahoo! FinanceThe above YChart already proves that the trend is what matters to investors in this growth story so don't get caught up on the fact that 43% is normally exceptional growth for a company. Remember that those deals will actually artificially inflate the revenue numbers in 2019.The point here is that the market just isn't paying higher prices than $35 billion for a stock expected to generate only $2.25 billion in revenues this year. Stocks with decelerating revenue growth don't normally maintain highly elevated P/S multiples of 15.6x.During 2019, the market will start shifting towards looking at margins. Exiting the year, Square will enter a year in 2020 where the company will push towards $3 billion in adjusted revenues so the fintech will be a rather large company at that point.An actual problem is that Square will have sizable margins in order to generate an ~$1 EPS in 2020. On 500 million shares outstanding, the company would need to generate $500 million in net income to reach that target. On $3 billion in sales that assumes a nearly 35% revenue growth rate for the year, the company would drop nearly 17% of revenues into income.In essence, one is paying 70x '20 EPS estimates of a company already generating substantial margins. One is paying a lofty multiple for a company that can't easily double and triple margins.Great for the company, bad for the stock.The key investor takeaway is that Square shareholders face further repercussions from the end of the momentum trade in this stock. The market won't like the stock above $70 on decelerating revenues in 2019 and beyond.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4245669,105102,2019-03-01T10:25:31-05:00,"The drop in Square following its earnings announcement was unjustified and the stock has room to grow.
        Read why I think Square is in a position that justifies investment at this level, but the window to act may close soon.
        Square is exposed to risk from deterioration of macroeconomic conditions since its main source of revenue comes from very small businesses.","Below I will look at the current state of Square (SQ) and the potential for equity appreciation over the next 12 months. Coming from a background in banking, Square and the crop of fintechs that emerged in the wake of the 2008 crisis such as Lending Club (LC) and On Deck (ONDK) have been one of my favorite group of companies to watch. In the 2010-2015 period these companies caused some heartburn for bank managers due to their rapid growth and the potential for industry disruption by Silicone Valley. Since then, the threat of complete disruption has subsided, but some of the fintechs continue to make good progress - Square being one of them. This article looks at Square through a fundamental business analysis and puts it in the perspective of the macroeconomic late-stage business cycle in the United States. My thesis is that Square is a fundamentally successful company with solid leadership and a proven ability to innovate. However, Square's source of revenue is risky (very small businesses) and it may suffer a significant drop in demand whenever the next economic downturn occurs. Since economic indicators in the US suggest that a downturn is not imminent, the recent drop in Square price is a good opportunity (at least in my personal opinion) to enter the stock. (Source: Square)Square started in February 2009 and took over the country with its unique white dongles for mobile phones which enabled anyone to accept credit card payments. It was somewhat reminiscent of the white headphones Apple introduced in the early 2000's which made the products instantly recognizable. Aside from pure investment purposes, I like Square for a number of reasons. I have personally experienced their products on many occasions and have always had a good experience - definitely an improvement over what existed before them. I have seen small businesses and individuals exchange money for simple services, something which otherwise may not have occurred since there were no other user-friendly tools. By enabling small businesses and sole proprietors to exchange products and services, Square is undoubtedly helping expand the economic pie. This is something which should be celebrated. However, when we are considering investing in the equity of a company we must look for indicators which will drive that value up. Positive externalities are nice but it's not what we're here for.So let's look at Square's Q4 presentation. (Source: Square)The company continues to grow fast. Net revenue, Gross Payment Volume (GPV) and EBITDA are all growing impressively. While Square made two acquisitions (Weebly and Zesty) in 2018, they were not large enough to distort the results. Including the acquisitions Adjusted Revenue growth was 64%, excluding them it was 53% - Square is not relying on acquisitions alone to boost revenue. Its core business is also growing.(Source: Square)Looking at revenue by client cohort shows us that the clients who are signed up each year contribute progressively more revenue. Even more importantly, the revenue derived from the same cohort grows over time. This trend is significant because it demonstrates that the company continues to deliver increasing value to clients over a multiple years. Client churn does not seem to be a concern because if a lot of the clients were leaving, the revenue from the cohorts would decline over time. Clients are staying and they are paying more.(Source: Square)Another important source of strength is the revenue diversification. While the transaction-based revenue is still the lifeblood of the company, subscription and services-based revenues are increasing faster and can provide some counterbalance in the case of an economic downturn (more on that later). Services-based revenues include Instant Deposit, Caviar, Square Capital and Cash Card, which are all offerings that are complimentary to the core payments business. While Square's stock dropped about 5% in after hours trading on February 27th from $79.35 to $75.92, it bounced back to around 81$ per share the next day. In my opinion the drop following the earnings announcement was a knee jerk reaction to revenue growth that was slightly less than what the consensus expected. We have to keep min mind, however, that Square is still a growing company that is investing in many new products and most metrics will bounce around. The forward P/E ratio has stabilized at the lower end of the range from the last year at around 110. Yes, this is a high P/E ratio which implies a forward EPS of around $0.7, but Square is a growth company and if it is successful at rolling out its ambitious new products to its existing and future customers, I think the valuation is justified. If Square surprises on revenue growth in the coming quarters, it is plausible that the forward P/E ratio can return to higher levels. In fact, for the stock to grow to $100, the forward P/E ratio will have to stand at around 150, which is well below its previous highs. Therefore, I believe a range of $95-100 is reasonable for Square provided no unforeseen circumstances. (Source: Square)Square has come a long way since its early days. The company now provides a large suite of products to small businesses including, payment acceptance, processing, debit cards, employee benefits and an In-App Payments SDK for online businesses. The increase in new products and services sets Square apart from other fintechs who were born around the same time. Many have stagnated because their original product has not seen wide adoption and others have struggled to pivot to new products. (Source: Square)Products launched in the last five years contributed 51% of Adjusted Revenues, a significant indicator of Square's ability to continuously innovate. Square also released one of the most popular apps in 2018 - Cash App. The Cash App may actually be Square's secret weapon because it leverages on the lessons CEO Jack Dorsey has learned form his other company - Twitter. While not a significant driver of revenues yet, Cash App was able to tap into major network effects and rocketed to the #17 place for free apps in the Apple App Store.(Source: Square)I am very excited for Cash App because launching a successful payments app is incredibly difficult. Just ask Zelle or Google Wallet. If Square is able to grow Cash App it has the potential to take marketshare from Venmo, which has stagnated in terms of new features. And this is where Bitcoin comes in. Cash App allows users to buy Bitcoin, although that is not its main use. I don't believe Bitcoin plays a major role in Square's pans for growth, but including this feature makes the app different and cool enough to take users away from Venmo. The results speak for themselves - the app had over 15M active monthly users as of December. Speaking of Venmo and PayPal, Square doesn't seem to have much new competition. I am not aware of new fintech entrants who are trying to go head to head with Square. Affirm may eventually be a challenger but for now the two companies seem to be going after the opposite sides of the register - Square goes for the business owners, Affirm goes for shoppers. With regard to existing competitors, Square has successfully maneuvered them over the last ten years. There is little reason to believe things will change dramatically over the next twelve months. If you've read everything above, you probably think that I am all in on Square. I would be except for one fairly significant concern which isn't a problem with Square specifically - it's the business cycle. One thing that Square has in common with other fintechs that came after 2009 is the they never lived through an economic downturn. While a couple other lending fintechs imploded even without the help of a recession, this is a valid concern for investors. Not only is the management team potentially untested in this area, but the main client base of Square is made up of very small businesses. Typically in a recession, small businesses do worst. Unfortunately square doesn't have a lot of ways to escape this predicament, although it is trying to diversify as fast as possible. (Source: Square)As of Q4 2018, more than 50% of Square's sellers generate GPV of more than $125,000. A business that does $125,000 in sales isn't tiny but it definitely isn't large. Even the largest category of sellers that Square breaks out (those over $500,000 in GPV) aren't exactly large businesses and can fail in a recession. Square's efforts to break into larger and more diverse businesses are absolutely necessary and need to be done ASAP before we reach the next downturn. Servicing larger businesses will ensure that the lifeblood of Square, the GPV, doesn't drop too much in a recession. The good news is that most economists and market observers do not foresee a recession in the next 2-4 quarters. Some have said that indicators are flashing signals of a late stage cycle, but there are no obvious reasons that things will change dramatically overnight. The St. Louis Fed published an article which examines four housing indicators which are typically canaries in the coal-mine for recessions. They concluded that:The analysis of the indicators is a mixed bag, but not an immediate alarm. For these reasons, it is my opinion that owning Square equity for the next 12 months offers a unique opportunity to benefit from the story of this company. Square has shown that it can endure challenges from incumbents and other startups. It is one of the few fintechs that is introducing products on a consistent and successful basis. The hidden weapon of Square is the Cash App which has a realistic chance of gaining significant marketshare and challenging Venmo as the preferred payments app in the US. The Achilles heel of the company may be a recession which hits its core demographic hard, but such an event is unlikely in the next 12 months. Lastly, this is not one of the safest investments as it should be obvious with any early stage tech company. I present it simply as an idea which I believe exists for a limited time based on factors which I believe are indicative of future success for the company."
4238257,104269,2019-02-05T14:17:15-05:00,"Square is building out services and making partnerships at breakneck speed with no sign of slowing.Square's high margin services like Payroll have more interest than ever.Why Square is in a better position than banks to do banking services for sellers.All together, this shows Square is becoming more of a business platform company than a mere payment processor.","Ah, dear reader, to look back upon the Square (SQ) of old:What's it look like today?(Not all partnerships and services shown.)I see a trend. Don't you?The humble customer can be forgiven for thinking of Square as a just a payment processor. But to think so as an investor would be living in a state of sin. Payments are not Square's platform, they are just a part of doing business. Doing business is Square's platform, and they are determined to buy, build, or charter until they can help every business accomplish everything it needs to compete. Is that a goal too lofty? Study the Diagram, dear reader.Square makes no secret of this. From their About page:Square has made it their mission to build or improve every service a business could use, and added some that consumers (Cash App) might need on top of that. If the economy is one long gold rush, Square is selling the shovels and the jeans. Less metaphorically, Square is turning technology into economic empowerment. Technology is all about leverage and scale, so strategically, I think we're seeing the brilliant start to one of the biggest business platform company of the future. Personally, I haven't been this optimistic about a company since Amazon's AWS started looking like a true platform in 2010/2011.How is the expansion going? Square partnered with Eventbrite (EB) in late 2017, Etsy (ETSY) in March 2018, and eBay (EBAY) in July 2018. Cash App has had a debit card out for over a year (all of 2018 they were #1 in Finance on the App Store and a higher rank than Venmo in Google Play), and as of mid-2018 allow direct deposit.Square acquired Weebly to round out their e-commerce in early 2018. In May 2018 Square announced Square for Restaurants, a dedicated hardware solution to address specific market needs. More market needs were addressed with the launch of Square Terminal in October 2018. To address needs for bigger customers, in August 2018 Square released the Square Reader SDK to allow customers to build their own custom hardware and run Square, like Shake Shack (SHAK) does. Shortly afterwards, they launched a partner program to facilitate companies building their own hardware.Then in January of this year, Square launched their Payments SDK: ""In-App Payments SDK rounds out Square's omnichannel payments platform, making Square the only provider with first-party products across online, in-person, and mobile app payments.""On the banking front, Square re-filed for a bank charter in December, now offers installment loans to customers, and just released a debit card for Square sellers. Now Square makes money on both their seller's revenue and their expenses (through debit interchange). It's no stretch to suspect that business credit cards are next in the pipeline, perhaps once the bank charter is accepted.Yes.In terms of risk management Square actually has a huge edge on traditional banks. Here's one illustration. At first glance, it might look silly:This tells us something big, and it's not that we should go out and start a juice bar. This tells us that Square has all the fine-grained economic data that banks could only dream of having.Originating business loans is something of a guessing game full of risk-aversion. The loaner wants to make sure the business isn't fraudulent, and isn't going to fold before it can repay. The party that is most likely to know if a business is legitimate and successful, or will be successful, is not the bank or even the borrower, it's the payment processor. Square knows everything about the business applying for the loan: Not only every transaction they make, how much and when, but everything about other businesses like theirs, and other businesses more broadly in the town or city they are operating in. With enough sellers, Square has a bird's eye view of economic data, and should be able to assess loan risk far better than traditional banks, which are working in the dark by comparison.I hope it is clear by now that Square is not a company that stands still.Even Square's ""older"" services, like Payroll (which now also offers benefits as of Nov 2018), seem more popular than ever. We can glean this from Google Trends as an approximation of interest:The massive expansion of services becomes even more striking when you look to other companies in the same market segment as a benchmark, like PayPal (PYPL). Compared to Square's list of partnerships, new markets and businesses, what has PayPal built themselves in the last ten years? In my opinion, PayPal's primary accomplishments of note are both acquisitions: Braintree (Venmo) in 2013 (great idea) and iZettle in 2018 (yet to be seen). iZettle is probably a good buy for PayPal, because their home-grown PayPal Here seller hardware seems to have stalled. (Have you ever seen a business use one?) As for partnerships, I'm not the first to note that PayPal lost their eBay partnership in the same year eBay and Square made one (note well: not for the same thing. Square originates loans for select eBay sellers. eBay intends to replace PayPal with Netherlands-based Adyen).Compared to Square, PayPal's development is sclerotic. This is not to say it's a bad business, PayPal is a large company that does serious amounts of transactions, but only one of them looks like a serious growth story in 2019. I wouldn't be surprised if Square eclipses PayPal's market cap within 5 years.The only place that Square appears fairly timid is international expansion. Square is available in a few countries, and their own page says: ""We're working to bring payments processing to more markets,"" But it's anyone's guess as to when. Of course, this is not a bad thing in itself: If you're investing today, it only means that Square has a lot more room to grow."
4243336,71685,2019-02-22T12:59:20-05:00,Square is due to report results on Feb. 27.The chart shows that the stock may break out and rise to $83.The options are suggesting the stock rises 11% following the results.,"Square's (SQ) stock may be getting ready to leap higher in the coming weeks, based on the technical charts and an analysis of the options market. The stock has consolidated since the end of January in a range between $68 and $75. Now the chart suggests the shares could surge by 10% over the coming weeks.The biggest drawback to Square is its valuation trading at nearly 70 times 2020 earnings estimates of $1.08 per share. That is much higher than many of the payment processors stocks, such as PayPal (PYPL).The company is set to report results on Feb. 27. Consensus analysts’ estimates are for earnings to have increased 68% in the fourth quarter to $0.13 per share on revenue growth of 61% to $453.9 million.Square's chart shows that the stock is forming an ascending triangle, a bullish continuation pattern. It suggests that the stock breaks out, rising above technical resistance at $78. If that happens the shares could go on to rise to around $83, its next level of resistance.Additionally, the relative strength index has been trending higher, and that would suggest that bullish momentum is entering the stock. Also, volume levels have started to decline as the stock has been rising. It would indicate that the number of sellers in the equity is likely diminishing.If the stock can climb above resistance at $83, it could open the door for an increase to $91.75.An analysis of the options suggests that Square’s stock could rise or fall by 11% from the $75 calls due to expire on March 15, using the long straddle strategy. It places the stock in a trading range between $66.75 and $83.75 by that date. The number of calls at the $75 strike price outweighs the puts by nearly 2 to 1, with about 20,000 open call contracts. It indicates the bets are for the stock to rise.Additionally, there are more than 21,000 open call contracts open at the $80 strike price. Those calls have gradually seen their open interest levels nearly double since the end of January. A buyer of the $80 calls would need the stock to rise to $82.25 to earn a profit.The one problem with Square is its valuation at 70 times 2020 earnings estimates. That is much higher than peers such as PayPal at 27.5 times 2020 estimates, Visa (V) at 23.7, and Mastercard (MA) at 25.Even when adjusting Square’s valuation for its earnings growth it's tough to justify the current valuation. The PEG ratio for 2020, based on its expected earnings growth of 53%, for the stock, is 1.3. That places the stock on the upper end of a reasonably valued stock.Momentum is bullish for the stock, and the options bets would seem to suggest that traders are looking for shares to jump in the days following results. However, volatility is expected to be high following the results, and the valuation is not cheap. It just means that the company is going to not only have to beat results but deliver a robust outlook for the shares to keep rising."
4233159,103416,2019-01-14T08:43:13-05:00,"Transaction-based revenue makes up about 75% of their total revenue.As sellers and individuals use more services, their activity with Square increases, which reinforces the company's recurring revenue model.The global opportunity for Square is potentially five times greater than the U.S. opportunity. This is exciting.","Square, Inc.'s (SQ) revenue is expected to grow 40% given its strong business model and brand reputation. Investors should be most excited about the company's high net promoter score of over 70, which means their sellers recommend the services to others. As the company expands its tentacles to other customers and industries, the company will only grow larger. This is known as the waterfall effect and should have positive results for the company. Management team has continued to execute and are strategic for 2019 and beyond.Square, Inc. creates tools that help merchants start and grow their businesses. Square allows sellers to accept card payments. The huge benefit for sellers it that there is a wealth of data for them to improve on future sales. Benefits include reporting and analytics, next-day settlement, and chargeback protection. Square's point-of-sale software and other business services help sellers manage inventory, locations, and employees; access financing; engage buyers; build a website or online store; and grow sales. These metrics are vital for any small business to grow. This is a competitive advantage for Square, and most other competitors do not even come close to being able to provide this data to customers.Square became a publicly-traded company on November 18, 2015, and began trading on the NYSE on November 19, 2015. Square sold shares to the public at a price of $9 per share in its initial public offering. Figure 1 shows that Square has fallen from the highs of $100 and is now currently trading around $55-60. Although the stock is under the key 50-day and 200-day moving average, there may still be hope for the company given its moat.Since Square offers tools for sellers to start, run, and grow their business, customers will naturally gravitate more products and services offered by Square. As sellers and individuals use more services, their activity with Square increases, which reinforces the company's recurring revenue model. In other words, once you start using Square, you will grow with the company and who else would they turn to for better service?(Figure 1 - Source: Stockcharts)On November 7, 2018, the company reported their Q3 earnings. The total net revenue grew 51% year over year. Net income includes a gain of $37 million as a result of the initial public offering of Eventbrite (EB). Without their investment gain from EB, the company would have actually suffered a -$17 million net income loss in Q3 2018. Figure 2 shows that the company is still operating at net loss (if we remove the EB investment), but the company has maintained a stance of continued reinvestment in the company for future growth. There are no major concerns for negative net income. The reason is because the company still has $750MM in cash on their balance sheet. This will provide ample time for the company to mature and ultimately switch the flip to become profitable.(Figure 2 - Company's presentation)Square's revenue comes from four different areas: Transaction-based revenue, Subscription and services-based revenue, Hardware revenue, and Bitcoin revenue. Transaction-based revenue makes up about 75% of their total revenue. Their subscription and services-based revenue make up 18% of total revenue. When the company decided to obtain Bitcoin revenue, it shows how the company is nimble and flexible. Management team is willing to venture into new avenues to grow their revenue, which bodes well for shareholders.(Figure 3 - Company's presentation)The company is guiding total net revenue of $895M to $905M for Q4 2018. The company consistently ranks well in iOS App Store for Business Applications. As a result, this can imply that the company has gained trust from users and will likely be a 'sticky' product for them. Users won't want to keep switching brands and usually, stick to just one company. Square is ranked top 15 in iOS App Store for Business Applications, which implies a strong market share in this space. Again, there is no comparable competitor that will threaten Square's continued revenue. Shareholders should expect net revenue to sustain 35-40% YoY growth due to loyalty from existing customers and also the ability to grow with customers.Shareholders are betting that the company can continue to capitalize on the largest revenue component, transaction-based revenue, by charging its sellers a transaction fee for managed payments solutions. The company selectively offers custom pricing for certain sellers, which incentives loyal customers to stay with the company longer. Square's brand is predicated on the idea that customers will trust them and find value in building and growing their businesses with their products and services.As the company's revenue has increased, their growth rate has slowed. Specifically, the company states, ""Future revenue growth depends on our ability to retain existing sellers, attract new sellers, and increase sales to both new and existing sellers."" The company's total net revenue grew from $1,267.1 million in 2015 to $1,708.7 million in 2016 and to $2,214.3 million in 2017. This is a great sign of continued and sustained growth. As the years go on, if the company can continue building its brand, then it should have no issue with boosting revenue. As you can see here, the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the total net revenue was $2,365.6 million. This already exceeded the full 2017 revenue.Investors should be excited about the global opportunity that is potentially >5x than in the U.S. Figure 4 shows that the company is understanding the next step in its trajectory. Management team is beginning to think and will likely be more aggressive in targeting the global market. Therefore, future revenue is looking to be strong as well. Of course, initial uptake and cost of establishing presence will be costly at first. However, in the long run, this may be a sustainable business model for the company.(Figure 4 - Company's website)Economists expect that 2019 will be a slowdown in economic growth. As a result, most companies are already slashing earnings such as Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Macy's (NYSE:M), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), and many more. Square's business model runs on transactions from customers. If the economy slows and customers don't shop as much, then this will hurt Square's bottom line. The U.S. Growth Domestic Product is expected to be 2%, a reduction from around 3%. It is likely Square's revenue may decline as much as 15%. This number is the usual corporate earnings decrease during recessionary periods.Given the recent 40-50% pullback in the stock and upcoming earnings, Square may be a potential company to have on your radar. Especially, given the holiday season that just ended, the transactions are likely to be higher for Q4 2018 as news was reported that there has been strong consumer spending. From a longer-term investment, Square has the management team with the desire to execute and they are able to strategically plan for global market share. Perhaps, the global potential is the more interesting part for the company as this will yield revenue and possibly push the company into positive net income in the nearby future. Square is one of those companies that have a strong advantage over other competitors based on product and loyalty to businesses. This is a great recipe for success."
4229679,23998,2018-12-21T14:13:28-05:00,"In September, I presented two ways of hedging Square in light of its large run-up and concerns raised about its valuation. Since then, the stock is down more than 35%.Here, I show how the two September hedges have ameliorated the decline.I also briefly discuss possible courses of action from here for hedged Square longs.","Square-using doughnut shop The Doughnut Project (via Square's Instagram).Shares of Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey's other company, Square (SQ), went on a tear after I shared it as a Portfolio Armor top 10 name with Bulletproof Investing subscribers on Feb. 8. Over the next six months, SQ was up nearly 80%, as the chart below shows.Chart via Portfolio Armor.The chart above ended in August. The following month, I noted a warning about Square's valuation, and presented two ways longs could hedge (Crash Protection For Square). Here, I show how those hedges have reacted to the stock's drop since.Since I shared those Square hedges, the stock has dropped more than 35%.Let's look at how the hedges ameliorated that slide and briefly discuss courses of action for hedged Square longs now.On Sept. 18, these were the optimal, or least expensive, puts to hedge Square against a greater-than-18% drop by mid-March (screen capture via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app).Note that the cost was a bit high: $7,250, or 8.24% of position value (calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts).Let's look at how that hedge has reacted to the 35% drop.Here's an updated quote on those puts as of Thursday's close (via CBOE):SQ closed at $87.89 on Sept. 18. A shareholder who owned 1,000 shares of it and hedged with the puts above then had $87,890 in SQ shares plus $7,250 in puts, so the net position value was $87,890 + $7,250 = $95,140.SQ closed at $55.90 on Thursday, Dec. 20, down more than 35% from its close on Sept. 18. The investor's shares were worth $55,900 on Thursday, and the put options were worth $24,675, using the midpoint of the spread. So, the net position value as of Thursday's close was $55,900 + $24,675 = $80,575. $80,575 represents a 15.3% drop from $95,140.On Sept. 18, this was the optimal collar to protect against a >18% drop in SQ by mid March, while not capping your possible upside at less than 19% by then.In this case, the net cost of the hedge was negative, meaning you would have collected a $2,250 net credit, assuming, conservatively, that you bought the puts and sold the calls at the worst ends of their respective spreads.Here's an update quote on the put leg of the collar (note that it's at a different strike than the first hedge):And here's an updated quote on the call leg:Recall that SQ closed at $87.89 on Sept. 18. A shareholder who owned 1,000 shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had $87,890 in SQ shares, $3,800 in puts, and if the investor wanted to buy-to-close the short call position, it would have cost him $6,050. So, the net position value on Sept. 18 was ($87,890 + $3,800) - $6,050 = $85,640.Since SQ closed at $55.90 on Dec. 20, the investor's shares were worth $55,900, the put options were worth $16,000, and it would have cost $175 to buy-to-close his calls, using the midpoint of the spread in both cases. So: ($55,900 + $16,000) - $175 = $71,725. $71,725 represents a 16.2% drop from $85,640.Square dropped by about 35% from Sept. 18 to Dec. 20, both hedges were designed to protect against a >18% drop and the optimal put hedged position was only down 15.3%, while the optimal collar hedged position was down 16.2%. In both cases, the time value of the put options gave a little bit more protection than promised since the hedges were structured to protect based on intrinsic value alone.This depends on what you think Square shares are going to do between here and March, and that probably depends, to a large extent, on what you think the market is going to do. The nice thing about being hedged, though, is that it gives you options (no pun intended). You don't have to worry so much about how much further Square might drop between now and March because your downside is strictly limited. You can exit now, for a smaller loss, you can buy-to-close the call leg of your collar to remove your upside cap, if you're bullish, and if you're even more bullish, you can sell your appreciated puts and buy more Square shares. In any case, you have breathing space to let the dust settle and decide on your best course of action without the anxiety of an unhedged investor."
4225692,71685,2018-11-30T14:24:11-05:00,Options activity has been bullish.Technicals point to a near-term breakout.Stock is overvalued and a rebound may not last.,"Options traders are making some big bets that Square Inc.'s (SQ) stock rises over the next two months. Yesterday saw increased call buying for expiration in January which has led to open interest levels at the $75 and $85 strike price to surge. The technical chart also suggests the shares of the payment processor may continue to rise as it nears a potential breakout. Square has fallen sharply since the beginning of the tech-led stock market sell off in October. But for a good reason, the company issued mixed fourth quarter guidance. That has led some sell side analysts to cut their price targets. But perhaps the most significant risk to the stock is its lofty valuation, which appears high, and suggests any rise in the stock may be short lived. Options traders were buying the Square options for expiration on Jan. 18 at the $85 and $75 strike price yesterday. Open interest at the $85 strike price rose by roughly 20,000 open contracts to a total of 28,000 open contracts. The $75 strike price contracts also increased by approximately 10,000 open contracts to around 25,000 open contracts. The $75 strike price calls trade for roughly $3.50 per contract and for a buyer to make a profit the stock would need to rise 12% to $78.50. Meanwhile, the $85 calls trade at roughly $1.20 and would need to increase 23% to $86.20 to earn a profit. The total open interest at the $75 strike price is worth about $8.5 million, a big wager. The chart also is pointing to a rise in the stock in the coming months as it nears a breakout. The stock has been in a downtrend since peaking in October. Now the stock is nearing that downtrend, and should the stock rise above $72, it would trigger a breakout, and may result in the stock rising to technical resistance at $83 The relative strength index also has been in a steady decline in recent months. But that too is showing signs of breaking out. It would suggest that bullish momentum may be moving into the stock. One reason for the bullish outlook may be the upcoming holiday season, which investors are expecting to be strong. It was yesterday that Guggenheim noted it anticipates a healthy holiday season based on recent indicators and expects the payment companies to benefit. One reason for the stock's big rise over the past year has been the promise of enormous growth, which the company has delivered. But that doesn't erase the recent struggles the company has seen in past months. The first being the loss of their CFO, along with the company issuing mixed fourth quarter guidance. The company is guiding earnings to $0.125 at the mid point vs. analysts estimates of $0.15. Despite analysts cutting earnings estimates 8% during the past three months, earnings are still expected to grow in the quarter 69% to $0.13, just on the upper end of the company guidance. Revenue growth for the quarter also is estimated to rise by 60%. Some could argue that Square is cheap when valuing the stock on a price to sales ratio, trading at fairly reasonable close to Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). But consider that Square is forecast to grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate through the year 2020 at 46%. Compare that to Visa at 11% and Mastercard at 15%, one can argue Square deserves to trade at that premium valuation.Even with the stock's sharp decline, the stock trades at 96 times 2019 earnings estimates of $0.73. It's also high when adjusting the stock's valuation for its compounded annual earnings growth rate of 60% through the year 2020, with a PEG ratio of 1.7. The stock is expensive vs. many of its payment peers such as PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), Visa and Mastercard. When valuing the four companies on an EV to forward EBITDA, one finds that Square is greatly overvalued vs. the rest as well. Analysts also have grown more negative on Square since the disappointing fourth quarter guidance. According to TheFly, Nomura Instinet lowered its target to $107 from $125. The recent market volatility is one of the greatest risks to the stock rising over the short term, such as another sudden downdraft in the market related to increasing trade tension between the U.S. and China following the G20 summit. Square is an extremely volatile stock and a change in market sentiment could easily send the stock sharply lower. Additionally, new data could show that the holiday season is not tracking as well and spending will not be as robust as some are betting, which would be extremely negative for the stock. Finally, trying to follow bets investors are making in the options market can be very tricky because they can change suddenly and without notice. ConclusionWhile momentum seems to suggest that Square could rise over the short term, it may only prove to be short lived. A strong holiday spending season could get the bulls juices flowing once again in this high-flying stock, but that doesn't mean the stock's valuation isn't stretched and that it may not come crashing down after all the holiday cheer.

4230727,22148,2018-12-30T18:32:03-05:00,Square shareholders have to reset expectations with the stock down $50 from the highs.Decelerating revenue growth trends will not be helped by a slowdown in the economy.The stock still trades at an elevated 12x '19 sales estimates.,"Despite obvious valuation issues, Square (SQ) investors were riding the stock higher above $100 earlier this year. The mobile payments provider traded at a market valuation approaching $50 billion, while the company only guided adjusted revenues to $1.57 billion for the year. My previous article discussed that even a dip to the recent price of $50 would leave the stock in a stretched valuation, so investors need to be careful chasing the stock here.Image Source: Square Cash websiteThe recent stock collapse has Square back down to where the stock traded in May prior to the irrational rally to $100. The stock is down $50, or 50%, in that time period.What an investor has to decide is if the move is a washout or a reset. The most noteworthy metric is that the forward P/S multiple is still elevated at 10x forecasted sales for '19.SQ PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsIn addition, when fully factoring in the 496 million outstanding shares, the market cap reaches $27.7 billion. Based on a $2.26 billion '19 revenue estimate, the forward P/S multiple reaches 12x. The multiple surges to 15x revenue estimates on a rally to $70 where the market valuation reaches $34.7 billion.The biggest risk to Square holding $50 is Q1 guidance. The company has generated accelerated revenue growth throughout 2018, but the weakening economy could impact the growth rate going forward.Square ended '17 with revenues growing at a 47% clip and reached 68% in the last quarter. A key aspect of the revenue surge is that Weebly and Zestry revenues contributed to reported Q3 growth rates with organic growth only at 56%.Source: Square Q3'18 shareholder letterIn addition, the gross payment volumes that make up the core of the business is only growing 29%. Hot holiday retails sales could provide a big boost to Q4 numbers, while setting up the company for deceleration in Q1.According to data from Mastercard, holiday sales surged 5.1% to more than $850 billion. The good news for Square is that traditional retailers like department stores struggled with a forecasted decline. The suggestion is that small retailers likely to use a payments solution from Square had a better holiday season, but the results could just reflect a further shift towards Amazon (AMZN).Either way, Square is likely to have participated in the strong retail season. Analysts are at Q4 revenues of $454 million, suggesting a growth rate of 60.5%. The issue is the Q1 guidance at 54% growth for revenues of $473 million. The analyst community only forecasts '19 revenue growth at 43%.The biggest problem is that the economy is going to provide a big headwind to accelerating revenue growth. After the U.S. printed a 4.2% GDP surge in Q2 and maintained a solid 3.4% GDP in Q3, the GDP forecast for 2019 according to Kiplinger is down around 2.6%.Note that Square grows in line with the economy due to expanding its product line, but the interesting point is that adjusted revenues grew at a 40% clip when '17 started. Considering the economy and acquisition headwinds and even the business scale two years later, the company growing in excess of the '17 growth rates appears illogical.The market hates declining growth rates for a high-multiple stock. Revenue growth is likely to decline from reported rates of nearly 70% in Q3 to possibly not even 40% next Q3. For this reason, Square is likely to fail to rally much above $50 in '19.The opportunity might exist to rally to prior support at $70 that could turn into strong resistance. This chart shows a likely bottom here at $50, with the stock headed back to a couple of layers of strong resistance topping out at $70.The key investor takeaway is that Square is poised to rally off the recent support at $50. The biggest risk threatening the thesis is that strong holiday sales combined with weak economic forecasts for '19 sets up the business for a substantial slowdown in growth rates next year.The stock will not trade at 12x '19 revenue estimates, much less maintain a rally above this level, if revenue trends head lower as forecast.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4223516,98236,2018-11-20T09:43:11-05:00,"Square reported very strong results and yet the shares plunged. Overall the shares are now down by more than 35% since their peak on September 28th.The results were once gain a substantial beat in terms of both revenue growth which reached 68% and adjusted EBITDA which more than doubled.While revenue guidance, which calls for 59% growth this quarter and growth above 40% next year should please almost all shareholders, the guidance for adjusted EBITDA was apparently a disappointment.Like many hyper-growth shares, Square has seen a rather substantial retrenchment in its share which has decline by more than 30% in the last 6 weeks.But this earnings report and concomitant conference call might reasonably be looked as another attainment for the company justifying its extended valuation.","Last week, Square (SQ) announced the results of its latest fiscal quarter. As has happened all to frequently this earnings season, investors found issues with the numbers and sold the shares aggressively. Overall, the shares are down 30% from their price at the end of September, and they have lost 15% of their value since earnings were reported on November 7th. One can look at half full and half empty glasses in assessing where Square is-although I think the glass is about 95% full. The shares declined because the company said it would spend more money on opex. But this is a company that just reported 68% growth, most of it organic. Its adjusted EBITDA for the quarter grew by 107%. For the first nine months of the year, adjusted EBITDA has risen by 77%, and the adjusted EBITDA margin has reached 15.5% up from 13.8% in the prior year period. The company raised revenue guidance for the current quarter to 59% and raised full year revenue growth guidance to 60% and suggested that adjusted operating margins would continue to grow at the same cadence next year as had been the case in the first 3 quarters of 2018. That is a pretty impressive margin forecast, and based on the historical track record, it will almost certainly be exceeded. .Square suggested that its growth in 2019 would surpass 40%. That means that revenues next year will reach $2.25 billion or higher. Viewed objectively, the fact that this company is planning on spending an extra $20 million on opex this quarter is really not an event that should be a cause for alarm. I would turn the analysis on its head and suggest that Square’s evaluation of its opportunity has clearly ramped up and it sees investment opportunities that it had not heretofore defined.I have found it surprising, to say the least, that headline writers haven’t picked up on the company’s forecast that 2019 margin expansion to what has been achieved in the first 3 quarters of 2018. The business model that has gotten this company to where it is, continues to improve at a remarkable cadence and I think that will continue to be the case. This is a company who has demonstrated leverage at scale quite consistently, and there is absolutely no evidence that the company will not continue to do so.From time to time, other issues plague Square shares. Most recently the departure of the company’s CFO, Sarah Friar has been an issue for investors. Sometimes investors can conjure issues that really do not exist. It has been speculated that the departure of Ms. Friar-and Friday was her last day-will lead to spending that is less focused and controlled. As it happens, Square has announced a dual CFO structure. The lead dog is going to be the company’s VP of strategy-and he has done that for some years now. Given that product strategy has been one of Square’s most compelling investment qualities, the appointment should, perhaps, have been received positively. But in this “risk-off” period, just about any change is considered a negative, and this one has driven Square shares down a couple of additional percent Friday morning.No one can “replace” Sarah Friar. She brought an element of calm and stability to Square’s business that is not likely to be replicated. And her background as a well-known analyst certainly provided that community with some confidence in how the company would be run.But perhaps the new duumvirate will be able to pick up the pace of innovation. I simply do not think that the departure of Ms. Friar is going to lead Square into an era of uncontrolled and poorly focused op-ex expansion. If the company believes that it can accelerate growth a few points by spending some extra opex, I think reasonable observers have to give a company with this record of execution the benefit of the doubt.Rationally, it is hard to believe that this kind of increased spend should be the cause for a market capitalization implosion of more than $6 billion. My guess is that Square shares are suffering from the same “risk-off” mentality plaguing almost all high-growth shares. Investors seem to believe that at the least a growth recession is impending and that higher-growth companies as this one is, should be re-rated to substantially lower multiples than had been the case earlier this year Somehow, the fact that Square’s growth rate is accelerating is seemingly not considered as valid in the analysis. There is a bit of cognitive dissonance in approaching a company such as this, where the percentage growth rate expectation has doubled over the past year.Square shares are not cheap on an EV/S basis. Most analyst use adjusted revenues in calculating valuation metrics and that makes sense as the additional revenues reported are just a pass-through. In the wake of the company’s most recent quarter and its guidance increase, Square has a 12 month forward EV/S of 14X. That puts the EV/S metric significantly above our best fit calculation for that metric. The question, as it is for almost all of the other hyper-growth names that wind up above our best fit average, is what the growth rate will actually turn out to be. So far, Square has been consistently successful in beating the guidance it has provided. If it continues to do that, then the EV/S metric will come down steadily. That is the scenario I think is most likely and is the basis I have for continuing to recommend shares.Square’s closest analog is thought to be PayPal (PYPL), although I think that is bit of a stretch, really. PayPal shares have an EV/S of less than 6X and an anticipated growth rate 1/3rd that of Square. PayPal is far more profitable and has a much higher cash flow margin compared to Square. The question for investors is growth versus profitability. I think both names are worth owning and I think both companies have strong futures. Despite the belief of some that this is a zero sum game, it turns out not to be. PayPal will compete with Square with its I-Zettle acquisition and Square's Weebly will be a more direct competitor of Shopify (SHOP) and the market will turn out to be large enough for all of these alternatives and more. This is a tsunami in terms of how people pay for things and bank and transfer money.I don’t propose to comment on the economy-this is an article about Square. Obviously, that said, however, Square is a company that derives a substantial component of its revenues from the retail sector and from the hospitality industry. Those sectors are frequently correlated with macro trends. I simply do not believe that macro trends are that dire as to put a hole in Square’s growth story. Others, no doubt will draw different conclusions. Square is too new a company to test any hypothesis regarding its correlation to the economy. I believe that the strategy of Square, which basically has and continues to be based on a rapid but controlled expansion of its offerings in a fashion that similar to that of building blocks is an element of exceptional opportunity. I believe that the strategy and its execution is the reason Square shares can sell at what appear to be elevated multiples without the multiples really being that elevated.When I look at the economy, I note that while housing starts and automobile sales have been slow or spotty, and growth outside the US has slowed in some geos, there hasn’t been some kind of massive slowdown that might lead to a reasonable conclusion that a recession is impending. Fed Chairman, Jerome Powell, in a Q&A session on Wednesday talked about the strength of the economy and his perspective on the need for future interest rate increases. For what it is worth, the macro presumably most correlated with Square’s outlook is retail sales. There is no sign that the growth in retail sales is tailing off. Consumer confidence is high and stable and obviously job growth has been rapid.Overall, the macros’ that might be significant in driving Square’s outlook are improving and not worsening, and I will try to document some of the growth drivers in the balance of the article. The company continues to morph from selling payments solutions to selling software that solve numerous business problems for SMB merchants and of course consumers as well. Just last Thursday, Square announced a revamped and expanded set of payroll solutions for its users., a rather significant opportunity not yet factored in to growth projections.There are some commentators on this site who seemingly take pleasure in attempting to approach their evaluation of this company without troubling themselves about how the company has gotten to its current growth rate. One contributor likes to talk about the use of stock-based comp as some unique issue for Square. Let’s face it, Square does use lots of stock-based comp-but it is worth noting that the stock-based comp ratio has started to fall. For the first 9 months of this year, stock-based comp was 14% of revenues compared to 16% of revenues in the same period a year ago. I would add that neither ratio is an outlier for a hyper growth company such as this is, who is engaged in acquiring talent at a rapid cadence.When I look at valuation, I consider the components of how the growth story for a company is put together. I would point to a single statistic that is worth considering in that regard. Last quarter the company’s subscription and services business grew by 155%. These solutions, which are quite diverse in nature, carry gross margins that reached 72% last quarter. These solutions are now 41.5% of adjusted revenues. I really have no special forecast that allows me to suggest how long Square might be able to maintain its growth in new sectors. But a reasonable investment thesis, or valuation analysis, simply has to consider the opportunities that Square has been able to identify and monetize.Square shares are notionally expensive-although less so now than a few months ago with higher growth and a lower share price. At the moment, I have the forward EV/S forecast to be 14X. ( I calculate Square revenues based on the company’s reported adjusted revenues which exclude pass through transactions and the company’s and Bitcoin revenues.) Some of that valuation relates to the company’s ability to generate cash and report a modest level of non-GAAP earnings. But the basis for evaluating Square relates to the length of time the company will be able to maintain its hyper-growth. I think that the trajectory of growth will be long and elevated. That is the basis for my recommendation to readers to acquire the shares while they have retraced so much of their gains from earlier in the year.Most analysts who cover Square are specialized in the financial services segment, and based on that, regard the company as a payment processor. Of course it does process lots of payments and the vast preponderance of its clients use its payment processing services. But payment processing revenue growth is now at far lesser levels than had been the case a couple of years ago. In this past quarter, payment processing revenues grew 29%But that is not why anyone is paying 14X EV/S for the shares. The major components of Square’s subscription and services business are its form of food delivery/restaurant payments etc., Square for Retail, Square for Appointments its cash advance program, its instant deposit program for both merchants and consumers and most recently the company’s installment financing product. These products reported growth of 117% last quarter, with non-organic growth from the acquisitions of Weebly (a web site builder) and Zesty (a corporate catering company based on SF) bringing the reported amount to 155%. But this is a company that is really focused on putting together a suite of solutions that provide the basis for an overall IT solution for its seller. The other day, Square announced an advanced payroll capability for its offering. The new capabilities add employee benefit modules to the company’s payroll capability. The company offers a rudimentary, but adequate CRM product for smaller sellers called Square Marketing. The company offers a solution, Square Invoices, for its sellers whose businesses do not lend themselves to taking payments from a credit card terminal. And it offers a primitive form of Inventory solution, sort of like an ERP product for small business.As I have written in past articles, Square is not going to be successful in every initiative it launches. There are plenty of execution and competitive risks that need to be overcome. But the opportunities-the TAM if you prefer-for some of these new capabilities is huge. Some of the opportunities are larger than the company’s overall current revenues.Like almost every other software vendor, part of the company’s strategy is to move up-market. At this point, 52% of its GMV is coming from larger merchants. The ability Square has to develop solutions used by larger merchants has been and will remain part of the company’s growth opportunity. At this point, the company does have a number of fairly large users such as Shake Shack (SHAK). It is also working with Eventbrite (EB), one of the sellers of tickets to events, to establish a payment relationship. But most of its larger sellers are businesses such as Joe and the Juice and Yassin’s Falafel-not household names but certainly not the kind of businesses that fail regularly either.The company has also developed hardware products that are showing a substantial level of growth. Many investor/readers are not likely to be particularly enamored with Square’s hardware business. The history of POS terminals has not been a happy tale for investors. But most Square hardware products are quite a bit different than POS terminals and are actually part of a total solution. The CEO has been quite eloquent about the product called Square Terminal. He describes legacy hardware as a stegosaurus He describes the black boxes that are used in restaurants and other retail establishments as something from the Dark Ages.The Square terminal, in its current incarnation lists for $400 and can be used on either a wireless or wired basis and takes most payment types. The company has spoken about selling millions of units. If that were to happen, revenues for Square would be noticeably impacted, but it is hard to handicap the potential success of this kind of a hardware device.The product the company emphasized as a growth driver this quarter was something called Reader SDK. Customers do not use Reader SDK by itself. In fact, the functionality comes as part of a platform approach Users use the Square hardware as part of a solution for their own , custom-built payment solution..Overall, the company sold $17 million of hardware last quarter which was 4% of the company’s adjusted revenue, but up 74% year over year. Based on the conference call commentary, it does seem as though the company intends to develop a robust hardware business That said, at least currently, the value of the company’s hardware is that it is a major component of the company’s competitive advantage in selling its overall set of software solutions. Often, the availability of the hardware is the deciding element in a customer decision. Square SDK for example is meant to appeal to software developers who can integrate the hardware into their solution with only a few lines of code. At the moment, the hardware business is not of great enough scale to produce GAAP gross margins. I would imagine that if the company’s plans in this space are realized, hardware adjusted EBITDA will show a major positive trend over the next several years.As mentioned, last quarter saw adjusted EBITDA rise by 107% year on year and the adjusted EBITDA margin rose from 13.4% to 16.2%. Part of that increase was a function of the growth of stock based comp expense, but in fact, stock based comp expense rose at a 45% rate year over year compared to the growth of 68% in revenues. The company reported a $35 million growth in net income in the period but that was offset by accounting for the mark to market gain when EB became a public company. Two of the larger factors in the growth of EBITDA were depreciation and amortization, which rose by almost 70% and the deferred revenue adjustment which contributed about 16% to the overall increase in adjusted EBITDA. In addition, net interest income rose by a noticeable amount. But the point is that commentators talking about Square’s margin problems haven’t taken the trouble to look at what the company is actually reporting.The company actually had a small decline in its GAAP research and development spend ratio. On the other hand, the sales and marketing expense ratio rose modestly as a percentage of revenue on a GAAP basis. The ratio of GAAP general and administrative costs fell noticeably in the period. There really is nothing suggesting the company is embarking a material upswing in operating expenses. Indeed, other than the impact of operating expenses from Weebly and from Zesty, both of which were loss making when acquired, Square would have shown an even more rapid increase in profitability than what it actually reported.Overall, Square, because it has so many interrelated offerings, has not been in a position in which it needs to compete on price, as its major competitive tool. There are plenty of competitors of Square who have price advantages in one area or the other. But looked at holistically, and considering Square’s set-up advantages and its ability to provide integrated solutions, Square has a very defensible competitive moat and that is only getting stronger as the company expands its footprint.More than a few commentators are concerned that Square’s competitive positioning is vulnerable to a host of competitors, some old and some new. Self-evidently at this point the competitors haven’t impacted the company’s business in any perceptible fashion. But over time, as Square gets larger, the natural course of events will see the company encounter more and diverse competitors in different business segments. Obviously, Square’s newest set of solutions announced last week that provide offering to users in the benefits space, brings the company into competition with companies such as ADP (ADP) and Paycom (PAYC). But the competition that arises will not be head to head. Square is not likely to want to sell its payroll/benefit solutions on a stand-alone basis where its advantages will not be substantial. And that is the whole point about how Square competes. It doesn’t necessarily have a better product in everyone of the many categories it sells. But it has been able to build a competitive advantage because users can add-on solutions to their core functionality.Most often, analysts consider Shopify and I-Zettle to be Square’s nearest competitors. I-Zettle, which was founded in Stockholm, was bought by PayPal for $2.2 billion. I have linked here to an article regarding Square’s competitors. The article, from a source called Merchant Maverick, focuses on Square from the point of view of its readership base. And it points out that Square’s platform is complex, and layered and appeals to many different kinds of businesses.In the last couple of quarters, Square has seen explosive grow in Square Cash-which might be described as a personal banking app. The growth of Square Capital has “leveled out” at 34%, but the instant deposit service continues to grow at extraordinary levels. Caviar, about which I have written in the past, also is continuing to maintain torrid growth-there is a way for a food delivery company to become a growth vehicle.Nowadays, the company has an offering called Square for Restaurants which can include Caviar but is also based on all of the other IT task involved in operating a restaurant business. The product was just launched in May of this year so its success is as yet not determined.Square’s competitive edge is not that it has better hardware than its competitors although at different times and in different categories, it does provide a differentiated solution. Its competitive advantage is the broad range of offerings it can offer SMB on a single platform. Without some tiresome review of all of those offerings, it is the platform and the interrelated solutions that are the special sauce, not the ability to take mobile payments from a Square card reader.As mentioned, I have recommended Square shares to readers in the past at different valuations. It would be nice to say Square share shares have to be bought because their valuation is compelling. My guess is, however, that if the valuation were compelling the business outlook would be far worse than it is today. My guess is that for the foreseeable future, the valuation of Square will never be compelling, but that it will provide investors with an excellent investment and positive alpha nonetheless. Looking backward to establish a valuation for a company that is growing at 60% simply makes little sense. And while Square has raised guidance consistently, the odds are it will continue to beat guidance in the future as it has in the past. That makes the shares worth owning"
4226510,24849,2018-12-05T13:57:12-05:00,Shares decline after small price target cut and market selloff.Company continues to beat estimates and raise revenue guidance.Company set up for the future of payments.,"While it wouldn't be hard to find a big loser after Tuesday's market selloff, payments company Square (SQ) was one of the biggest losers. While the name did see its price target cut by a street analyst, the note itself wasn't that bad and the analyst still sees tremendous upside in the stock. As the company is well positioned in the evolving global payments space, investors might want to consider buying the dip.Stifel did maintain its Buy rating on the stock, with the price target going from $100 to $95. Considering that shares closed Tuesday at $63.51, analyst Scott Devitt believes the name will still head much higher from here. While he did talk about the potential for added competition in the future, his main concern was that Square's share count is rising thanks to investors converting some of their convertible debt for equity, so he factored that into his valuation. This isn't major news, since the company did talk about it in its Q3 shareholder letter:Like many growth companies, especially ones where early investors and management hold a lot of a second share class (Class B here), Square investors are facing a bit of dilution in terms of the publicly-traded Class A. The Class A share count went from 269 million in November 2017 to more than 308 million in November 2018. Some of this is from the conversion of Class B shares to Class A, and the convertible notes mentioned above factor in as well. Of course moving forward, settling debt entirely in stock means more dilution, but less cash needed to be paid out. The company's balance sheet remains quite strong at this point, with about $1.8 billion in cash and investments against a little over $1 billion in debt.One of the things I like most about Square is that it continues to beat estimates and raise guidance. As you can see in the graphic below, top and bottom line beats have been seen every quarter over the last two plus years, and revenue growth has been accelerating at a nice pace. The company has lost money on a GAAP basis so far this year, but that's mainly due to investments in future growth. Q3 2018 did see a GAAP profit, however.(Source: Seeking Alpha Square earnings page, seen here)When management gave its original forecast for this year in the Q4 2017 shareholder letter, adjusted revenues were expected to be in a range of $1.30 billion to $1.33 billion, or 34% growth at the midpoint. The most recent forecast calls for the adjusted top line to be in a range of $1.569 billion to $1.574 billion, 60% growth at the midpoint.Investors that have followed Square are used to revenue guidance being raised quite often. As we close out 2018, I'm currently looking at estimates for next year, and they have certainly risen over time. On March 1 of this year, the street was looking for adjusted revenues of $1.69 billion in 2019. The current estimate stands at $2.25 billion, and it certainly would not surprise me to see a higher number when all is said and done.Over the last couple of years, shares of Square were one of the market's biggest winners. They started 2017 in the mid teens, but as the chart below shows, they peaked out at over $101 just a few months ago. Recently, shares bottomed under the 200-day moving average, and they fell below that key technical level again Tuesday during the selloff.(Source: Yahoo Finance)Investors looking to take advantage of Tuesday's market selloff should consider Square. The payment company has seen a significant pullback in recent months, yet it continues to beat estimates every quarter and raise its revenue guidance time after time. The average price target remains in the mid $80s, so analysts see the name heading much higher. With a strong balance sheet helping to foster future growth investments, Square is set up for a nice future.Author’s additional disclosure: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in this article.

4221814,22717,2018-11-13T15:18:28-05:00,"Square, Inc. (SQ) is overvalued on an absolute and comparable basis.SQ is worth no more than $48-49 per share, even taking into account its large expected growth rates.Look to sell if you have a large profit.","Square, Inc. (SQ) is a fast growing payment ecosystem company whose stock price is expensive from an absolute and comparable valuation standpoint. Square's market value is $30 billion with two share classes. The A shares are worth $22.4 billion, and the B shares ($7.7 billion) are not traded:Source: HakeSQ is valued very high on an absolute basis. By our estimates SQ sells for 136 x earnings and a Price/Earnings ratio of 85x next year earnings. SQ's Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is extremely high: 119x this year. 74x next year EBITDA cash flow:Source: Hake Some argue this is a well deserved valuation. They point to the huge growth SQ has shown over the past several years. Look at the table below:Source: SQ SEC filings and Hake estimatesYou can see that for the past two years SQ's quarterly growth rates year-over-year of Adjusted revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income have been growing, up until Q3 2018. This past week SQ announced quarterly guidance which shows that the mid-point of the expected growth is slowing.Source: SQ Q# 2018 Shareholder LetterWe used the mid-points for 2018 guidance. These are shown in blue for Q4 2018. So,for example, Adj. EBITDA is expected to be 82% higher in 2018 than 2017, compared to 210% last year. Also Q4 YoY growth numbers (at the mid-point) is going to be lower than reported than Q3 2018. More importantly, margins are showing deterioration. Look at the table below:Source: SQ SEC filings and Hake estimatesFirst, on an absolute number basis, one would expect that a stock selling for 19 x sales on an EV/Sales basis would have massive margins. But SQ's margins are low. EV/EBITDA is only 16.5% of Q3 sales. Adj. Net Income is only 15% of Sales. That is respectable but not deserving of such a high valuation. But maybe margins are expanding rapidly. Not so. Margins fell in Q3 compared to Q2 2018, and the same is expected (on a mid-point of guidance basis) in Q4 2018, as seen in the table above. So, for example, Net Income margin is only going to be 14.5% in Q4 compared to 15.2 in Q3. And EBITDA margin in Q4 will still be below Q2 2018, although it will be higher on a YoY basis, but just marginally higher than Q3 2018. Based on this trend, we estimate that 2019 margins will be 10% lower.SQ is not worth its present stock price, based on comparison with other payment related stocks. This can be seen in the table below:Source: HakeThis table shows that SQ is valued 6x higher the median P/E ratio of 9 other comparable stocks. Its EV/Sales ratio is 4x higher than the median and its EV/EBITDA ratio is over 6x higher than the median. The two highest P/E ratios are about 35x earnings, whereas SQ's P/E ratio is 136 x this years' expected earnings. The two highest EV/EBITDA ratios in the group are about 25 x, whereas SQ is valued at 119x (and 75x based on 2019 estimates, as seen in the first table in this article). Well, maybe comparable stocks have lower margins than SQ. If that is the case, then maybe SQ should be valued much higher. Look at the table below:Source: SEC filings and Hake estimatesSQ has much lower margins than than median of each of its sector comparable companies. Its Net Income margin is 14%, or which is 29% below the median. Its EBITDA margin is 30% below the median, and its operating cash flow and free cash margins are both over 40% below the median margins. The obvious conclusion is that SQ is not worth anywhere near the massive premium valuation its stock trades at compared to 9 other sector comparable stocks. There is a worthwhile explanation of why the market is so enamored with SQ. SQ's growth rates are significantly higher than its peers. Look at the table below which shows the Most Recent Quarter (MRQ) growth rates of the top 5 largest comparable stocks, which have a similar size to SQ:Source: SEC filings and Hake estimatesThis shows that SQ's sale, Net Income and EBITDA growth rates are significantly higher than its peers. But the Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow rates are much lower. So as long as sales growth and Net Income rates are much higher than its peers, SQ may continue to enjoy the market's favor. But in the third table to this article we showed that the Q3 and Q4 2018 estimated rates are slowing. Its superior growth rate will continue to slow, as its base numbers get larger. Here is our estimate of SQ's growth rates:Source: Hake estimatesYou can see that we assume sales will grow 10% per year lower than 2018, with an increment of 1% lower each year, and margins will grow 5% lower than 2018. The net effect is that over the next 4 years will sales will grow to almost $7 billion, over 400% higher than 2018. Net Income and EBITDA will be almost 4x higher as well. The net effect is that the valuation ratios fall:Source: HakeBy the end of 2022, SQ's valuation ratios are similar to its peers, based on its expected growth of about 4x in sales and income and cash flow.To account for SQ'a significantly higher growth rate, we adjust our valuation analysis upward, as seen below.Based on our analysis, SQ is not worth its $73-$74 price. Based on our analysis, SQ is overvalued by $50 per share, and is worth $48.66. Here is how we came up with that figure.We used three comparable valuation ratios and adjusted them. First based on a comparable P/E ratio, used the median sector P/E ratio, SQ is worth $12.30:Source: HakeBut based on our estimates of the growth in Adjusted Net Income from $221 million to $798 million over the next 4 years, we adjust the expected P/E valuation by 3.6x:Source: HakeSQ's expected price is $44.24 based on P/E comps and expected Net Income growth.Second, based on the comp median EV/Sales ratio, SQ is worth $18.83:But taking into account the expected 440% growth in sales over the next four years, we adjust the EV/Sales comp based target price by 4.4x:SQ's expected price is $83.14 based on comps and the expected sales growth.Third, based on the median EV/EBITDA ratio, SQ is worth $12.50:Sources: HakeBut since its growth in EBITDA over the next four years will be 360%, SQ would be worth $44.95.Source: HakeNote, in all of these we did even deduct from the valuation based on SQ's sub-par margins. We gave SQ the benefit of the industry median valuation. But SQ's margins are lower than the median comps, so we adjust the valuations:Putting these altogether we get a price of $48.66 per share on average.Source: HakeThis is $25 lower than the SQ's present price. It is 33% overvalued based on this analysis.Don't buy SQ at this price. It is worth no more than $48-49 per share, taking into account its comp and growth valuations. This is based on our estimates of continuing growth in sales and EBITDA but at lower than recent rates, as well as SQ's margins, which are below the industry average. There is a lot of good news built into this stock. If the company's growth falters significantly over the next several years, the stock has no margin of safety built into it. It is overvalued even today with its expected growth built into the stock. Look to Sell over the next quarter if you have a large profit, and wait to buy SQ once its ebullient valuation is deflated."
4220552,22148,2018-11-09T15:42:50-05:00,"Square actually traded down following a big Q3 beat.A lot of the negative signal from prior to the quarter contributed to the weakness in the stock.The market has missed that share counts are exploding, up 15% YoY.The stock still trades at about 23.5x '18 adjusted revenue estimates.","As some shareholders hate, my previous articles on Square (SQ) pointed out the substantial risks in owning the mobile payment provider with limited profits at stretched valuation multiples. Following the release of Q3 results, some more cracks are starting to form in the runaway growth story where my investment thesis already identified negative signals.Image Source: Square websiteThough mostly ignored now, the GPV (gross payment volume) growth slipped below 30% for the first time. The majority of Square revenues are still based on the transaction fees and growth continues to decelerate as Square shifts toward subscription and services revenues.Source: Square Q3'18 shareholder letter Another issue is that the Weebly and Zesty acquisitions closed in Q2 provided an incorrect view of substantially accelerating revenues. In reality, these deals added $25 million in additional revenues that contributed a large amount of the accelerated growth and beat in the quarter. Without these deals, revenue growth was 56%, not the headline number of 68%.The midpoint growth rate for Q4 dips down to 59%. Square typically beats their very conservative guidance, but adjusted revenues at nearly $450 million will require another substantial beat to match the Q3 growth rate.Remember that the CFO leaving was a negative signal that some growth rates weren't sustainable at these levels. In addition, the company is almost spastically moving into new areas like installment loans, corporate catering and website building. All areas moving away from their core payment processing business and related fintech business opportunities.These moves all add to revenue growth in the next year, but all revenues aren't equal. Square is going to have a difficult time managing a full suite of business tools with best of breed products as the company becomes extremely diversified. At some point, the company might need to let some other company handle food delivery, catering and website building. The company is better suited to developing the tools to integrate payment processing with online food ordering and delivery.The hidden costs of the Weebly and Zesty deals plus continued large amounts of stock options given to employees is that the exploding share count. Square only listed 432 million diluted shares last Q3. The amount surged 15% to 496 million in the last quarter and my calculations in the previous article only used 470 million.For this reason, the market value of the company is now an incredible $37 billion even after this 25% dip from the highs to $75. A lot of the focus on revenue increases will now require investors to start shifting toward per share measures.The key P/S ratio continues to show the stretched valuation even after these dips. Even with the inclusion of the new revenue streams, Square only forecasts adjusted revenues of $1.57 billion for the year. The below metric is crazy high, but it's far behind the actual metrics. The forward P/S ratio is closer to 23.5x using the correct market cap.For this reason, investors need to keep an eye on the divergence of these key metrics for next year. Revenue estimates have surged by ~$600 million in the period, but EPS estimates remain virtually flat, having hovered around $0.75 all year.The point here is that the per share metrics aren't improving due to a confluence of higher share counts and soaring costs. In Q3, operating expenses were up 56%. The farther the company expands away from payment processing and some of the related financial modules like payroll and business loans, the more difficult the ability of the company to generate leverage in the business.The key investor takeaway is that Square appears to be chasing business at this point. The exit of the well respected CFO Sarah Friar is still a red flag while the stock trades at elevated levels as if the payments company has a highly profitable core business growing at the headline growth rates.The market will probably like the stock back at $70 again. An investor needs to keep in mind that even down at $50 that Square will have a $25 billion market cap. The stock will still trade at a crazy P/S multiple of 11x '19 revenue estimates.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

Cash is a peer-to-peer (P2P) payment solution similar to PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo. Recode calculates that Cash had seven million users in 2017.Two million sellers and 250,000 invoice sellers were using the Square point-of-sale (POS) devices in 2017, Expanded Ramblings calculates. The Square Terminal could increase the company's footprint use, because retailers of all shapes and sizes can use it.To explain, the Terminal is a small device that allows users to pay with mobile wallets, swipe cards, and insert chip cards. The Square Terminal is small enough to work with any cash register. Therefore, large retailers such as supermarkets, or discount stores, could easily adopt Square through Terminal.An obvious use for Terminal is modernizing the payment systems at dollar stores. For instance, the POS at my local Family Dollar, a Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) subsidiary, is slow and expensive, and often fails to work with the store's digital coupons.Importantly, Cash is a money-transfer app accepted by big retailers. Recode claims Walmart (NYSE:WMT), America's biggest retailer, and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) were the biggest recipients of Cash payments. That indicates Cash is reaching a mass market with ordinary people.CNBC claims 33.5 million people downloaded the Cash app in August 2018. If that is true, Cash has more users than Venmo. They downloaded Venmo 32.9 million times.In detail, Cash supposedly lets you send money instantly in exchange for a 1.5% fee. Square offers a personalized Cash Card that allows for ATM withdrawals and provides discounts at some merchants.Therefore, a huge opportunity at Square is to offer POS devices integrated with Cash. To explain, consumers could pay with Cash, receive Cash-based rewards points, and use Cash at ATMs. A Terminal that allows Cash users to receive change in paper cash will be a popular product.Okay, Square is growing and has great opportunities in front, but does it make money?No, the company is losing money right now. For example, it reported a net loss of $5.91 million and an operating loss of $2.65 million for the second-quarter 2018. However, Square recorded revenues of $8.5 million and a revenue growth rate of 47.77% for the same period.Markedly, SQ achieved a gross profit of $315.82 million for the second-quarter 2018. Therefore, I think it is on the verge of making money. For instance, the company had an operating cash flow of $18.98 million and a free cash flow of $3.92 million on 30 June, 2018.Unfortunately, Square reported a financing cash flow of $788.77 million for the second quarter. That indicates it is borrowing to finance its expansion.Square now has some money. It reported $1.428 billion in cash and equivalents, and $318.64 million in short-term investments on 30 June, 2018.Consequently, Square had $1.747 billion in the bank at the end of the second quarter. That number exceeded its debt of $1.071 billion.Those numbers prove that Square can make and keep money. Now it needs to generate income.Predictably the company pays no dividend and has no dividend history. However, its stock was valued at $71.12 a share on 26 October, 2018.I think Square is an interesting fintech play because of its fast-growing platform. The popularity of Cash in particular shows the company could become a major financial services player.If you are looking for a risky fintech stock with long-term potential, Square is a good speculative play. I expect SQ to start to make money and its share value to grow in the next few years. However, I do not expect it to pay a dividend soon.Investors might make money because Square is a likely acquisition target. I think a big bank or credit card company could buy Square to expand their fintech business.Under those circumstances, the likely buyers for Square are large US banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Citibank (NYSE:C). Another possible buyer for Square is the fast-growing Chinese financial services company Ant Financial.The privately-held Ant owns the world's second most popular payment app Alipay, but it lacks an American footprint. Buying Square will give Ant access to the American market via Cash.Moreover, Ant Financial is probably the world's most valuable unicorn. Reuters claims analysts valued Ant at $150 billion in July 2018. However, it will have a difficult buying Square because of the growing anti-Chinese hysteria in the United States.Other suitors for Ant could include Uber Technologies, Inc., Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), SoftBank, and Walmart. Walmart has been on a digital acquisition spree recently.In addition, Walmart is a major player in financial services with its own mobile wallet, Walmart Pay. Buying Square will make give Walmart more control over fintech and empower its efforts to crush NFC payments.Ant, and its competitor Tencent Holding Ltd. (OTCPK:TCEHY), owner of WeChat Pay, have the money to buy Square. Notably, WeChat Pay is the world's popular payment app with 500 million users, Business Insider calculates. However, WeChat Pay has no market penetration in the United States.Obviously, Square is now a prime acquisition target because of Cash's success. Furthermore, being an acquisition target makes the company a good speculative stock investment. Square shareholders will profit through the money the acquiring company pays for their shares.Square has become one of the most interesting fintech stocks around. Look at it if you want an alternative to PayPal.This article was first seen at Market Mad House."
4213168,21523,2018-10-22T13:29:45-04:00,"Square is one of the fastest-growing payment processing stocks in the market.Payment processing is one of the most attractive industries for investment.While Square faces risks both acute and chronic, the market potential is immense and the valuation is reasonable.","Earlier this year, we went through many of our very favorite industries to go hunting for investments in.One of the industries we highlighted was the payment processing industry.There are so many wonderful attributes of this business. For one, payment processing is a very stable business, with a very high percentage of recurring revenues. These companies process millions of transactions per day from their customers, taking a small percentage cut of each. While certainly, transaction volume would fall in a recession, the fact is that a lot of these transactions are non-discretionary, for items like food, housing, child care, transportation, and so forth. Payment processing companies can rely on stable cash flows.Another great aspect is the fact that there is a global ""war on cash"" occurring right now. Electronic payments are faster than cash, safer than cash, and easier to track and record than cash. Consumers, merchants, and governments all three prefer electronic payment for the most part - a real rarity! This sets up an enormous addressable market where there will be 750 billion electronic payments per year by 2020 - and increasing at double-digit rates! There are few markets in the world as enormous that are growing this rapidly.Finally, payment processors have what we call a ""sticky"" business. Payment acceptance is one of the very core processes of any business, and once a working system is in place, most merchants are loathed to switch out of it. This creates inertia that allows payment processors to keep their customers, benefiting as they grow their sales.So, clearly, payment processing is a wonderful business. However, a lot of the major names in this space are big, over $100 billion companies. While all these are damn good companies - and likely successful investments - the real impressive gains come from finding somewhat smaller companies with similar market potential.In this vein, this month we'll profile just such a company - Square (SQ). Not only does Square fall into the smaller, higher growth end of the payment processing space, but the stock has also taken a 25% haircut over the past month, making it more enticing than ever. Is it a good buy right now? Let's see...Square started life by providing a rather clever solution for traditionally cash-or-check only businesses to accept credit card payments.Basically, Square built a simple card reader device that plugs right into the merchant's smartphone or tablet device. Combine this with a matching app (the software side) and, voila!, the merchant instantly had a point-of-sale terminal! Square merrily took about 3% of each transaction, along with some money for the hardware and onboarding fees.The company has since built out its offering into adjacent categories. Square now offers additional software for inventory management, payroll processing, invoicing, gift card management, and order management. It also has a business lending arm (Square Capital) and a restaurant delivery service (Caviar). Additionally, it has tailored its point-of-sale software for specific industry categories, such as restaurants, retail, and appointment-based service businesses. Square offers many of these add-on features as cloud-delivered software-as-a-service (SAAS), which customers subscribe to and pay for on a recurring basis.Perhaps even more important is that Square has been able to sell its payment and software services to ever larger customers. At the end of last year, customers with over $500K of gross payment volume accounted for 20% of customers, up from 9% just a few years earlier. This is a big deal, as larger customers tend to be stickier and less likely to go out of business, be acquired, or try something else.In all, transaction fees still account for the vast majority - about 80% - of revenues. Subscription fees account for 16% of sales, while the rest (hardware and bitcoin) make up the remaining 4%. It should be noted, though, that subscription fees are the fastest growing. Just 3 years ago, they were only 5% of sales.Square is delivering big-time growth. In the most recent quarter, revenues grew 48% year-over-year. Even considering the impact of acquisitions that represents a pretty impressive step up from 30% growth delivered in 2017.Management believes it has a very large market to address. In the U.S. alone, Square estimates a potential $26 billion market for small/medium business (SMB) payment processing, $14 billion from Square Capital, $12 billion from its various subscription software offerings, $11 billion from Caviar, and $6 billion from e-commerce software, putting the total addressable somewhere near $65 billion. What's more, they also estimate the international opportunity in the same verticals as more than 5 times that large!All told, this is a very attractive growth market for a firm that will just cross $3 billion in revenues this year. When compared to competitors like PayPal (PYPL) ($15 billion in revenue) or Visa (NYSE:V) ($20 billion), Square is just getting started. That makes its growth potential all the more enticing for us as investors.While payment processing is a great business that mitigates a lot of typical business risks, Square is certainly not without its challenges, both acute and chronic.Acutely, much of the recent stock price drop was due to the announcement that CFO Sarah Friar is leaving the company at the end of the year to take the CEO spot at Nextdoor. This is a big hit, as Friar is easily the most visible company officer to investors. It is also worth noting that she may be its most important executive, considering CEO Jack Dorsey doubles up as chief executive for Twitter (TWTR) as well. Top level turnover is always reason for pause, and this is no exception.On a more chronic basis, given that this is a huge potential market, the lineup of competitors is both long and strong. PayPal offers very similar services to Square, with a more robust international footprint, wider vendor acceptance, and stronger e-commerce offerings. Large tech companies, notably Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have introduced their own payment processing layer services. Countless other SaaS firms are attacking the business software market for inventory, payroll, and order management.At present, the market is plenty large enough for all of these players without affecting pricing. However, should we start to see competitors resort to price wars to win new business, it would raise concerns. Additionally, should Square's revenue growth trajectory take a massive hit due to competitive deficiencies, it would be another cause for concern.One big difference between Square and some of the competitors we mentioned is that, to date, Square is unprofitable - although it should flip to profitability late this year or early next year.That said, the firm is cash flow positive, which is far more important. While cash profitability is still pretty minimal at this point (4.6% on revenues last year and 2.7% in the trailing 12 months), management has reported ""adjusted"" EBITDA margins of about 15%. These are a decent proxy for targeted cash flow margins. Similarly, more mature competitors like PayPal generate free cash flow margins in the low 20% area. It seems reasonable to assume that Square will eventually be able to generate the same kind of profitability.To get a valuation, let's lay out some assumptions on top of this 20% long-run free cash margin assumption. We see revenue increasing at 45% this year, 30% next year, followed by a gradual decline from the mid-20s. Share dilution has been meaningful, so we model a 9% increase in shares this year, 7% next year, and 5% for several years after that. We use a target mature P/E ratio of 21, which is fairly conservative for this kind of business. Lastly, a 12.5% discount rate bakes in the reasonable amount of risk faced from an unprofitable business with a lot of strong competition.After the math, we get a target price of about $79. That makes the company's $74 current price seem like a decent - if not screaming - buy.Over the long term, Square looks like a solid business that should do very well for shareholders, and today's price seems like a good place to get in for new investors."
4219835,104746,2018-11-08T10:43:00-05:00,"Square's earnings has put the company in a position to succeed and continue growth.Square's products have shown excellent growth and look to keep going.Jack Dorsey, CEO, has mentioned that the Square Terminal could become their best selling product.","Square (SQ) has released an exceptional earnings report that is being mistreated by traders. As of right now, the stock is down after the shareholder letter, yet Square was able to show profit and great guidance. Last earnings report, the dip didn’t last long. I believe this will be the same as earnings were top notch. The biggest part for me about this earnings was their ability to prove earnings. This is because many bears believe that since the company has a $30 billion market cap and wasn’t profitable, it is a scam. Now since profit was found, that argument dies and this stock becomes a steal at the price. With all of their products growing at extreme rates, Square looks to become a giant and the investors will be paid for it. All of their investments and products have paid off and are seeing growth out of the roof. This earnings report reassures investors and shows that the company is headed in the right direction.Square released Q3 earnings on November 7th, and the price has dipped even though the earnings were good. This is very similar to Q2 earnings as they dipped then jumped to all time highs in the coming weeks. This being said, the dip that Square stock is seeing should not worry any investors.Image Source: Shareholder letterAs seen in the shareholder letter, Square was able to turn a $6 million net loss last quarter into a $20 million net gain this recent quarter. This is huge as it shows they are able to make profit with a growing business model. As well as this, their revenue was able to grow to $882 million or 51% year over year. All of this growth could be attributed to subscription and services-based revenue of $166 million in the third quarter of 2018, up 155% year over year. Dorsey has also mentioned in the conference call that the new Square Terminal could be their best product yet. This is huge as it shows that Square still has a lot of room to run. Another good thing mentioned in the conference call would be that Cash App is continuously a top 25 app on the market and cash card is helping drive growth. To add to this, Caviar has grown 100% year over year. These are all huge as it continues to prove that Square is able to grow at a rapid rate.Many people may be wondering why Square was down after hours and in early trading Thursday. To that I would most likely respond that Sarah Friar the CFO is leaving. Although this was and is a known thing, this is still a lingering issue yet is affecting the price too much. As is obvious through this article, I am bullish on Square. This being said, Square is still yet to find a CFO in 3 months of searching. This is due to the fact that they want a perfect CFO to lead the companies financials. This should not be an area of concern. The only real reason for concern would be that it is simply valued very highly. I wouldn’t go too far to say it is overvalued because the potential and growth that it entails are huge and can prove to make the company even more profitable.All in all, the dip after this earnings was unjustified and the market should bring the price back up in the coming days and weeks. I see Square profitable for investors in both short term and long term and might even be able to hit $100 by the end of the year. With proven profit and growing products, Square’s future is looking very bright. That being said, Square needs to get a CFO as soon as possible and release numbers that help prove that Cash App is doing well. If these are released and obtained, Square is looking at joining internet giants. This idea of them joining internet giants isn’t crazy as Square is 13th in top retailers by U.S. sales. Image Source: Investors RelationsThis is a very interesting fact as it shows that Square is truly a widely used market. Square was able to surpass big names such as Macy’s and Apple which is an amazing feat. All in all, as long as Square can continue to improve, Square is a very smart investment at these prices."
4221309,101850,2018-11-12T11:20:51-05:00,"Strong performance in 3Q18 with a beat across street estimates.Subs and services segment remain the strongest business line, partially aided by continuous investments in new businesses.SQ adjusts forward guidance, we believe they are achievable and that growth momentum will continue at least in the near term.","Square (SQ) had a solid quarter in 3Q18, with adjusted revenue at $431 million compared to $257 million in 3Q17. The 68% yoy growth was also ahead of the street estimates by around 6%. The pace of top-line growth accelerated in this quarter from a c60% yoy growth in the previous quarter (i.e. 2Q18 vs 2Q17). Adjusted EBITDA for 3Q18 is $70 million compared to $34 million of 3Q17, ahead of the consensus estimate of c$66 million. EBITDA margin was at 16.5% vs consensus estimate of 15.9%. The results also beat street EPS estimates by 2 cents - $0.13 actual vs $0.11 estimates. Total Revenue for 3Q18 increased by $296.9mn or 51% as compared to 3Q17.We believe that this robust performance by SQ is going to continue driven by the company’s strategy to invest in strong new businesses. For this quarter, subs and services segment was the star performer.Revenue from transaction based services was at c$145.4 million mainly due to the yoy growth in Gross Payment Volume (GPV) of 29.2% in 3Q18, which continues to benefit from growth in processed volumes from the existing sellers, in addition to the contributions from new sellers. In this quarter we saw that number of sellers clocking more than $125,000 in annualized GPV represented 52% of GPV which is a surge of 48% from 3Q17, outlining an up-market push. The GPV growth was marginally ahead of the consensus estimates. Net transaction yield was broadly stable, at 1.07% in the current quarter.Total cost of revenue for the 3Q18 increased by $162.9 million or 44% yoy. Cost from transactions in the 3Q18 surged by $86.4 million or 26% yoy. Profit from transactions resulted from higher margin products together with the improvement in transaction cost.Contribution from subs and services - which was the strongest performing business this quarter - was mainly driven by Instant Deposit, Caviar, Cash Card, Square Capital, as well as acquisitions in the second quarter, increased by $101.2 million or 155% compared to 3Q17. Organic growth was at c125%, comparable to the rate last quarter, which excludes the contribution from Zesty and Weebly. Subs and services contribution towards total net revenue increased to 19% in 3Q18 from 11% in 3Q17.Cost of Subs and subscription in 3Q18 got inflated by $28.9 million or 159% yoy, mainly emphasising increased costs related to the growth of Caviar and also with the growth of Cash Card and Instant Deposit (albeit at a rate much lesser than Caviar). Cash and capital products remain one of the key drivers in this segment and will continue to see some runway in our opinion.Hardware sales driven by Square RegisterHardware revenue for the 3Q18 increased by $7.5 million or 74% yoy primarily reflects growth in shipments of Square Register, which is their first all-in-one offering that includes hardware, point-of-sale software, and payments technology. It was also driven by continued surge in sales of contactless and chip readers, as well as growth in sales of their Square Stand and third-party peripherals.The Hardware costs for 3Q18 surged by $4.5 million or 24% yoy where the increase reflects growth in sales of Square Register, Square Stand, third-party peripherals, and contactless and chip readers. Also the ASC 606 adoption resulted in an increase of $1.3 million in hardware costs for the 3Q18, which is primarily related to earlier recognition of costs of hardware sold through retail distribution channels and hardware instalment sales in line with the revenue recognition for such sales under ASC 606.The company’s Cash App started to provide customers the facility to buy and sell bitcoin. Revenue contribution from bitcoin consists of the total sale and transfer of bitcoin to the customer's account. This added c$43 million to the top-line in the last three months, and c$114 million in the last nine months. We see the impact of this new revenue channel to normalize in FY19 as revenue figures become comparable.Operating expenses increased in 3Q18 by $129 million or 55% yoy mainly due to a surge of $53.2 million (or 64%) in expenditure from product development (personnel costs related to engineering, data science, and design teams). In addition, sales and marketing expenses for 3Q18 increased by $49.8 million or 75% yoy as volume of activity with the Cash App peer-to-peer transfer service and Cash Card issuance costs increased. Also, advertising costs from online, mobile, and televised marketing campaigns during the period and sales and marketing personnel costs saw an increase during the quarter.General and administrative expenses for 3Q18 increased by $21.2 million or 33%. Transaction, loan and advance losses increased by $3.7 million or 19% and amortization of acquired assets increased by $1.1 million or 483% yoy.Amortization expenses saw an increase of $0.7 million, or 46% yoy, primarily due to the addition of customer assets post acquisition.Interest expense for the 3Q18 saw surge of $4.1million yoy, which is attributable to the issuance of convertible notes.All in all we observe that the operating costs increased hand in hand with the revenues. Signs of operating leverage are yet to be visible in the business. However, we believe that with gain of scale, SQ will display operating leverage in few years, driven by margin expansion.SQ raised its 4Q18 adjusted revenue guidance to $446-451 million and that of FY18 to be $ $1.569-1.574 billion (from an earlier guidance of $1.520-1.540 billion). Both the ranges imply a c60% growth from last year’s actuals to the range midpoint. Considering the momentum in SQ’s performance, we believe that this run rate is achievable. Further, lowered EPS guidance of $0.12-0.13 for 4Q18 and $0.45-0.46 for FY18 also look achievable. Interestingly, the 4Q18 EPS guidance saw a tightening from the earlier $0.42-0.46.While all appear in favor of the stock, and we believe that investors should capitalize on the growth momentum, we would like to highlight some risks in the business. Being a disruptive play focusing on the small business sector, the landscape is prone to economic instability (quite dependent on macro conditions) and disruption from new entrants. Credit risks also remain critical to the business. However, near term, we see the strong performance continuing."
4214069,104802,2018-10-24T19:25:56-04:00,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) and Square, Inc. (SQ) operate fairly similar businesses.Using PYPL as the reference point, P/S shows a floor of $62 and upside ranging from $93 to $146.Normalizing P/E by substituting PYPL's operating margin for SQ’s, you get a floor of $57 and an upside of $120 to $190.Various analysis point to PYPL being overvalued which means SQ has further to go.","You don't need to be a mathematician to be able to calculate Square, Inc.'s (SQ) valuation. You do need to circle back on your assumptions about whether PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) provides a good point of comparison. When Square is held up next to PayPal, it shows that though their business models may differ in some ways, they give a good reference. It then points SQ likely undervalued relative to PYPL. However, PYPL itself is overvalued.It's been proposed that PayPal offers a good point of comparison for Square. They both operate as payment service providers that allow businesses to accept payments. SQ hit the scene with their easy to use the dongle that turned your phone into a payment processor. PYPL operates almost exclusively online. In fact, for years they remained unchallenged until startups like Stripe decided to disrupt their business model.Where the two differ, come in where they operate. Square firmly sits in the real world while PayPal lives in the digital. These trends are changing with SQ actively working on establishing their online platform and PYPL's acquisition of iZettle.However, you get the sense Square is more interested in becoming the true one-stop-shop for payment processing than PayPal. Both make things easier such as payroll. However, PYPL seems to point to existing ways of using their program (IE mass payments) rather than SQ Payroll which made a specific application for payroll.It's been pointed out Square trades at a much higher P/S multiple than competitors like eBay (EBAY). But, that makes sense considering how much faster SQ continues to grow. PYPL is no slouch. Their 5-year average is 18.26%, and their most recent YOY was 20.77% with the latest quarter at 22.99%.Source: Morningstar PayPal AnalysisThat's not the same thing as SQ. People pay more for it because the company threw up a 5-year average of 61.20%, and the most recent YOY of 29.59% with the latest quarter at 47.77%.Source: Morningstar Square AnalysisAt the moment you have the P/S for PayPal at 6.7x and Square at 11.32x. Well, that kind of makes sense. If you assume PYPL at fair value, then if SQ puts up 2x-3x their growth pretty consistently over the years, you would expect the P/S to be double that of PYPL.In fact, you really could only make the argument it's overvalued based on the 2017 numbers. At the paltry 29.59% growth YOY, they should only be 1.42x the P/S ratio of PYPL instead of the 1.69x they're at now, or a 9.51x P/S and $62 a share.But if you took the 3-year average, you would be at 2.12x the value of PayPal or 14.2x for an equivalent P/S, and using the 5-year average you would be 3.35x the value of PYPL, or at 22.46x for an equivalent P/E. That would put the share prices at $93 and $147 per share. Where their growth will land is debatable. But, when you compare the valuation to that of PYPL unless the overall market itself changes, it would be tough to see share prices drop much below $60.Let's consider what the P/E ratio would look like for Square if they hit operating margins similar to those of PayPal. Right now PYPL runs an 18.82% margin. If that margin is applied to SQ's TTM, they will put out Net Income of $505m. That equates to $1.28 per share. At the current price, you end up with 57.86x P/E. That's a good bit higher than PYPL who sits at 44.33x.If you consider these companies equivalent and ignore the growth aspects, then a similar valuation of Square would give a share price of $56.74. That's not too far below the low end of what was noted above for the P/S analysis. Again, let's consider what happens when you account for the higher growth. Using the 3-year growth rate, you'd take 44.33 x 2.12 = 93.98 P/E, and the 5-year 44.33 x 3.35 = 148.5 P/E. That would give share prices of $120 and $190, respectively.It's fair to point out that the business models between the two don't work in the same way. Square actually manages not just software, but hardware devices. PayPal is only just moving into that area.Source: Morningstar Square AnalysisSource: Morningstar Square AnalysisSo far the article discussed why the valuation of Square relative to PayPal is not outlandish, as well as where potential floors and ceilings might exist. However, that relies on the assumption of PYPL being fairly valued.Referring to the PayPal financials, you can see the expansion most years. Current margins sit near 18.82%, up from 17.3% the prior year. It would be very unlikely that operating margins will get much higher than 20%. The costs of the business simply make this prohibitive (unless you decided to redefine revenues and expenses which is another discussion for another day).Take a step back to the growth rates that PayPal currently sees. Right now they've seen averages that sit between 18%-20% per year. Let's consider the S&P 500. The S&P 500 trades at a P/S of 2.14x, and a P/E of 22.60x. The earnings growth rate ranged from 6.0% to 14.41% for 5-year and 3-year periods, respectively. Just using the 18% point, you would get a multiplier for PYPL of 1.24x - 3.0x.Using these multipliers, you would expect to get a range of P/S on PayPal between 2.65x-6.42x, and a P/E of 28.02x-67.8x. Considering that the current earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 sits at 17.75%, on a relative and short-term basis, the stock is overvalued. But in considering the median for the S&P 500 sits at 12.28%, you'd be looking at a P/S of 3.17x and P/E of 33.12x. That would give you a P/E derived price of $55.64 and a P/S price of $40.12.However, the story doesn't end there. Remember that PayPal has been expanding their operating margin. That gives another multiplier to consider. The PEG ratio for PYPL sits at 2.24x. The S&P 500 sits at 1.25x. This would imply that PYPL is being overvalued, and better priced at $47.32.If you consider Square relative to PayPal, it appears to be fairly valued, if not somewhat underpriced. However, PYPL itself seems to be trading at a premium and has further to fall. This would indicate that SQ also has further to fall. That would mean it likely to find a stable value base around $60. The easiest way to trade these pairs is to take a long/short on any oscillations that cause compression in values. If SQ trades lower to PYPL, or PYPL higher to SQ, it becomes a no-brainer."

Since then, the stock is down 20%.Here, I show how the two September hedges have ameliorated the decline.I also briefly discuss possible courses of action from here for hedged Square longs.","Square-using doughnut shop The Doughnut Project (via Square's Instagram).Shares of Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey's other company, Square (SQ), went on a tear after I shared it as a Portfolio Armor top 10 name with Bulletproof Investing subscribers on February 8th. Over the next 6 months, SQ was up nearly 80%, as the chart below, via Portfolio Armor, shows. Last month though, I noted a warning about Square's valuation, and presented two ways longs could hedge (Crash Protection For Square). Here, I show how those hedges reacted to the stock's drop since. Since I shared those Square hedges, the stock has dropped more than 20%.SQ data by YChartsLet's look at how the hedges ameliorated that slide and briefly discuss courses of action for hedged Square longs now.On September 18th, these were the optimal, or least expensive, puts to hedge Square against a greater-than-18% drop by mid-March (screen capture via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app).Note that the cost was a bit high: $7,250, or 8.24% of position value (calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts).Let's look at how that hedge has reacted to the 20% drop.Here's an updated quote on those puts as of Thursday's close (via CBOE):SQ closed at $87.89 on September 18th. A shareholder who owned 1,000 shares of it and hedged with the puts above then had $87,890 in SQ shares plus $7,250 in puts, so the net position value was $87,890 + $7,250 = $95,140.SQ closed at $69.03 on Thursday, October 11th, down more than 20% from its close on September 18th.

So, the net position value as of Thursday's close was $69,030 + $16,225 = $85,255. $85,255 represents a 10.4% drop from $95,140.On September 18th, this was the optimal collar to protect against a >18% drop in SQ by mid-March, while not capping your possible upside at less than 19% by then.In this case, the net cost of the hedge was negative, meaning you would have collected a $2,250 net credit, assuming, conservatively, that you bought the puts and sold the calls at the worst ends of their respective spreads.Here's an update quote on the put leg of the collar (note that it's at a different strike than the first hedge):And here's an updated quote on the call leg:Recall that SQ closed at $87.89 on September 18th. A shareholder who owned 1,000 shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had $87,890 in SQ shares, $3,800 in puts, and if the investor wanted to buy-to-close the short call position, it would have cost him $6,050. So, the net position value on September 18th was ($87,890 + $3,800) - $6,050 = $85,640. Since SQ closed at $69.03 on Thursday, October 11th, the investor's shares were worth $69,030, the put options were worth $9,700, and it would have cost $1,815 to buy-to-close his calls, using the midpoint of the spread in both cases. So: ($69,030 + $9,700) - $1,815 = $76,915. $76,915 represents a 10.2% drop from $85,640.Although Square had dropped by about 20% from September 18th to October 11th, and both hedges were designed to protect against a >18% drop, the optimal put hedged position was only down 10.4%, and the optimal collar hedged position was down 10.2%. In both cases, the time value of the put options gave a bit more protection than promised since the hedges were structured to protect based on intrinsic value alone.That's up to you, but the nice thing about being hedged is that it gives you options (no pun intended). You don't have to worry so much about how much further Square might drop, because your downside is strictly limited. You can exit now, for a smaller loss; you can buy-to-close the call leg of your collar to remove your upside cap, if you're bullish; and if you're even more bullish, you can sell your appreciated puts and buy more Square shares. In any case, you have breathing space to let the dust settle and decide on your best course of action, without the anxiety of an unhedged investor."
4211162,22148,2018-10-11T13:32:14-04:00,Square falls after moving further into risky loans.The departure of the CFO is another big risk for the stock.The long-term margin picture is mostly misunderstood by investors leading to the insane valuation when the stock reached $100.Square is still too expensive at $70 with these negative signals.,"In a predictable move, an overpriced stock like Square (SQ) quickly surged to $100 and just as quickly gave up the gains of the last few weeks. The mobile-payments company has quickly expanded into new areas and the market rapidly accepted them as easy money. Some likely doubts are emerging over a further expansion into the loan business, questioning if Square is running out of opportunities for customer expansion in more strategic areas.With the stock trading down below $70 on the CFO leaving, investors need to grasp the actual valuations at these levels before even thinking about buying this dip.Image Source: Square Installments websiteSquare announced an intent to launch Square Installments on October 4. The stock hasn't looked back, having lost over $30 in just a few trading days.The company had previously started lending to payments clients via Square Capital. Square has the ability to view the payments trends of a business to better gauge the risk of lending capital to them. In addition, Square gets the extra benefit of small businesses with easier access to financing to drive more sales.Square Installments is far different. The program helps give the customers of their clients the freedom to make large purchases via installments. This again allows Square to help drive more transactions as their clients miss fewer sales from financing options not being available to customers.The program offers qualifying purchases between $250 and $10,000. Monthly payments are fixed for up to 12 months at rates of up to 24%. The interesting part is that the suggested terms would likely match readily available credit cards that charge rates up to 20%.The Installments plan appears to compete directly with GreenSky (GSKY) that focuses on facilitating loans in the home improvement sector via quick and easy online applications. GreenSky charges similar rates, but the company uses bank partners to fund the loans. Analyst Mark Palmer of BTIG questioned whether Square was taking on too much risk by offering such low rates with alternative lender Affirm charging higher rates.Remember that Square doesn't have any extra knowledge about the customer as opposed to their payments clients. Extending credit to these customers adds risk to the payments concept. The company already wrote off $22 million last quarter before even starting Installments.One of the more perplexing parts of the Square story is why investors are so willing to pay an insanely high multiple on sales for a low margin business. My use of the adjusted sales figures for Square got a lot of backlash in my previous article.As Square provides every quarter, sales are broken out into either gross or adjusted sales. Like most payments companies, Square has a large amount of gross revenues that are pass through transactions fees. The large expense skews the revenue figure much higher than the reality of revenues where the company collects a margin.As per the below table, Square forecasts 2018 gross revenues of $3.21 billion and adjusted revenues of $1.53 billion.Source: Square Q2'18 shareholder letterThe amounts leave a large gap due to transaction-based costs that account of ~63% of transaction-based revenues in the last quarter. As a portion of total revenues since Square continues to move into subscription revenues, the costs were ~48% of revenues. Throw in the Bitcoin transaction costs and the costs of handing transactions topped 50% of total revenues. These pass through costs aren't what one normally considers as revenues.Now investors can utilize which ever number they want to derive the valuation of stocks, but the importance is understanding the difference between a payments network like Visa (V) and payments providers like Square and PayPal Holdings (PYPL). The below operating margins are the officially reported numbers. PayPal has an adjusted margin above 20%, but the numbers don't come close to approaching the 60%-plus margins of Visa.Using adjusted net income, Square comes up closer to 2% and of course growing rapidly. The ultimate target is more like PayPal and not like Visa.Considering the comparison to PayPal, one can easily make a quick comparison on valuations. PayPal has transaction costs around 30% of revenues, but the company doesn't focus on the concept of adjusted revenues so investors need to keep that in mind. The market clearly makes the distinction in the valuations. A quick comparison to the forward P/S multiples of Square, PayPal and Visa leaves a wide gap between the valuations. PayPal has remained rather steady over the last year at slightly above 5x sales while Square more than doubled to over 16x sales. The company now matches the Visa multiple without even using diluted share counts at 470 million shares. The actual multiple is closer to 15x forward sales estimates with the stock at $70.A key here is that this comparison is based on using gross sales for both PayPal and Visa. Not exactly a fair comparison to Square. Using the same 5x gross sales multiple for Square would place the stock at a valuation under $20 billion or closer to $40. A lot of investors fail to conceive the multiples that a stock like Square trades at on forward sales when looking through rose-colored glasses at the future. Putting the numbers on paper, an investor probably gets a better view of where the stock stands now at $70 and in the next run to $100. The below revenue forecasts use the estimate of 2018 revenues at $1.53 billion and compare the P/S multiples under scenarios of 30% and 50% growth.Revenue growth @ 50% - $70/$100Revenue growth @ 30% - $70/$100Even with 50% revenue growth through 2021, Square still traded at 9.2x those revenues when the stock traded at $100. Assuming growth slows as Bitcoin revenue falls off from the $35 million a quarter rate or the size of large numbers hit growth, Square was still trading at over 10x 2022 revenue estimates with 30% growth.Another way to look at the story here is what would one pay for Square if the company achieved 20% operating margins in 2022. Under the 50% revenue growth scenario, Square would generate operating income of $1.55 billion more than four years from now. Would you pay $33 billion ($70) or $47 billion ($100) for the stock with net income after a 20% income tax rate barely topping $1 billion?The key investor takeaway is that Square is great company still trading at an insane valuation. The departure of the de-facto CEO in CFO Sarah Friar is a major problem for an expensive stock. At this point, Square still is interesting at $70 and hopefully investors have a better understanding of the insane valuation when the stock reached $100.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4211836,104269,2018-10-16T08:38:34-04:00,"Square continues to increase its reach with new products and markets.One analyst downgrades, but their new concern doesn't stand up to scrutiny.One analyst upgrades, complete with an apology for missing Square’s rise.CFO Sarah Friar is leaving to become CEO of Nextdoor. Jack Dorsey’s response gives us some tea leaves to read about the expected future leadership of Square, but also Twitter.","First, two PR headlines this quarter that go hand-in-hand:You can now use Square (SQ) to power your own custom seller hardware, instead of buying Square's, from vending machines to ordering kiosks to whatever else you can dream up. In addition, Square now maintains a list of partners who create custom hardware and also custom mobile payment solutions, e-commerce solutions, and so on, backed by Square. Together these announcements increase Square's reach and appeal to larger businesses that would be unsatisfied using out-of-the-box hardware (and out-of-the-box rates). The much-lauded example is Shake Shack's new ordering kiosks, which run custom hardware powered by Square and built by a Square partner (Fuzz). Shake Shack using Square (and being one of the first SDK users) shouldn't be too surprising, since SHAK CEO Randy Garutti is on Square's board.(Also: An older announcement from may, in case you missed it, Square launched Square for Restaurants)The other big headline this quarter:Square Installments lets sellers close more big ticket sales and get paid immediately. Square Capital originates the loans. Like the loans Square Capital already makes, Square may sell most of them and only hold a few on their balance sheet. I think this program is a logical extension of Square Capital flexing their loan capability, but the picture isn't so rosy for two Analysts at BTIG, who give Square a Sell rating on the news at a 12-month price target of $30(!).An analyst expressing extraordinary fears requires extraordinary scrutiny, so let's check their work. The BTIG report claims that:It does raise questions, but they're easily answered. First, BTIG’s assessment does not accurately reflect Affirm’s offerings. They do offer 0% APR at many retailers:An expanding list, since according to Affirm’s merchant docs on the Zero-percent Financing:According to squareinstallments.com (the official site for customers), Square’s 0% APR is only available for the 3 month installment option, so it is clearly a more conservative program than Affirm's.On top of this, Affirm is willing to originate larger (and longer term) loans, and is willing to originate loans with no minimum credit score and no minimum credit history (according to NerdWallet). It is unclear if Square Installments will play as fast and loose as Affirm does, but I suspect they will not, and either way the amounts at stake are both smaller and to be repaid sooner.So to believe BTIG, that is, to believe that Square will not be sufficiently paid for the risk it will take on, is to make a number of assumptions about how Square Installments will work compared to BTIG's benchmark company. But the fundamental differences above suggest that Affirm is probably taking on more risk than Square Installments, which explains the higher-end APR discrepancy. The lower-end APR discrepancy is simply BTIG's analysts making a mistake.BTIG's raises a concern about multiples, but this makes the same argument that drives people like Nassim Taleb insane. It is not reasonable to assume in future revenue projections that a company will just stand still: That they won't create new products, enter new markets, in new countries, and so on. If you tried to eyeball Square’s growth in 2014 based on its existing business, you would be assuming no European markets, no Cash App, no business services like Payroll, no loans at all, and so on, which would be a huge mistake. Predicting future price based on offhand multiples works well for certain classes of companies. They don't work for companies that move. Many analysts have already made the mistake of valuing Square as a transaction processing company instead of what it really is, a business services company that (as a component) also does transactions. I wrote about that before, here. Along that line, I think it's a mistake to bet on Square standing still. BTIG does grant this, mentioning in their risks:In light of this, and in light of the overblown loan fears, it seems like a thin case for a $30 price target.A similar mistake made by other analysts (but not BTIG) is assuming that payment processors like Clover may be able to eat square’s lunch by relying on some marginal transaction rate advantage. But Square reiterates on almost every conference call that a large number of their merchants use 2 or more services[1], such as Square Payroll (or appointments, or food delivery, or business loans, or invoices, or employee management, or e-commerce, etc). It is unlikely such a customer will drop the Square business services ecosystem for a few transaction points. This would be like thinking an iPhone user would switch to android over Apple Music costing a few bucks more than Google Music. Users buy into ecosystems, and ecosystems are sticky, and what most analysts failed to understand (until this year) is that Square is not a payment processor, they are a business services ecosystem.[1] ""More than half of our larger sellers used two or more Square products during 2017."" said Dorsey in the Q1 2018 call.It’s worth remembering that even big players like Amazon tried to undercut Square on rates, and failed. Analysts have been underplaying the stickiness of the ecosystem for years. Amazon Register shut down in 2015.Canaccord Genuity, which initiated coverage with ""Hold"" in early 2016 (up 384% since), has just upgraded SQ to ""Buy."" On Barrrons:Graham also wishes to temper fears about CFO Sarah Friar's departure:Also chiming in on current events was Nomura Instinet's Dan Dolev, who has a $125 price target, said last week's sell-off was an overreaction and kept his buy rating.When you listen to a lot of conference calls, you instinctively start to look forward to hearing certain voices. Sarah Friar speaks with a sincere clarity that immediately gives the impression that you're listening to a truly brilliant person, and with Friar, you are. In fact her presence is so good you have to wonder if she's CEO material. And now we know, she is: Friar stepped down as CFO of Square to become CEO of Nextdoor.C-Level departures always raise eyebrows, and seeing a favorite exec leave a favorite company certainly leaves me with a sting, but I'm not concerned for the fundamental future of Square, which should not (and does not) hinge on any one person. CEO Jack Dorsey went on to say on Twitter:As it should be.The Square board (specifically David Viniar, the former CFO of Godman Sachs) is on the hunt for a new CFO, and Friar will stay on until December to ensure an orderly transition. My conjecture, it will probably be Jacqueline Reses, the current Square Capital lead, who was also Chief Development Officer of Yahoo before Square.This changing of the guard opens a very obvious question: Friar is obviously CEO material, Dorsey is already CEO of two companies, and many already assumed Friar may some day be CEO of Square. So why didn't Square make her CEO instead?That this didn't happen tells us something, I think. Dorsey mentioned that he ""was unrealistically expecting to be working with Sarah well into our late 90s [...] Unrealistic because I knew of Sarah's lifelong ambition to run her own company."" If Dorsey is unwilling to give up the reins to Square, and considers it his lifelong project, then at the very least this signals something about where his heart lies in the SQ vs TWTR question (Dorsey is CEO of both at once). Reading between the lines we can expect:Twitter is at this interesting stage where it is just becoming profitable and also has one of the most influential platforms in terms of pop culture and politics. This must make it super attractive to some buyers (did GOOG shut down Google+ to make room for TWTR? They shut down Google Video after acquiring YouTube after all). The speculation is interesting but thin, and Twitter has always been an acquisition target, so we'll just have to wait and see.Long term, I am very long Square. Short term I think the Twitter question is interesting enough to hold a small position."
4209179,69905,2018-10-01T12:22:35-04:00,"Square is not growing as fast as investors might be led to believe.Transaction-based costs coming down is benefitting Square's adjusted revenue growth rate, but this is not sustainable.Square's valuation is too hot and leaves investors with no margin of safety.","Square's (SQ) shares continue to climb up, without stopping for breath. However, the problem with the steady climb is that it gives investors the illusion of safety that nothing can go wrong with Square. But I argue that at $40 billion market cap, all reasonable insight is priced in and that now optimism is also priced in.Square has done tremendously well of late. At the halfway marker of 2018, Square's Q2 2018 results continue to impress the market, with the top line jumping 48% YoY to $825 million. However, when we dig just a little bit further, we become aware of another leading revenue indicator, which is its adjusted revenue. This excludes transaction-based costs and bitcoin costs and adds back deferred revenue adjustment accounting. Thus, the $385 million investors saw at Q2 2018 is actually more representative of Square's actual revenue stream, which is a punchy difference from the top line investors might be thinking of as Square's top-line revenue.Given that we have now established that, we should be focused on adjusted revenue, rather than total revenue. Let's assert; what is Square's adjusted growth rate?Source: Author's calculations, SEC filings; adjusted revenueAs the table above highlights, Square's adjusted revenue is undoubtedly growing fast, at mid 50%s YoY. However, please see the table below, which highlights the total revenue growth rate.Source: Author's calculations, SEC filings; total revenueThus, hopefully, we can see that Square's total revenue is not growing at quite the pace of its adjusted revenue. In the graph which follows, I have represented this variation.Source: Author's calculations, growth rates normalizedThis table should make an investor pause for thought? Given that total revenue is growing at a slower pace than its adjusted revenue, there should be some kind of efficiencies being squeezed out of its business model?Management does not give guidance on its transaction-based costs. Thus, presently we only have data up to H1 2018.Source: Author's calculations, transaction-based cost growth ratesIn the above table, as common sense would dictate, as Square's operations increase in size, economies of scale push down the company's transaction-based costs. In FY 2016 as the total revenue was up 35%, its transaction-based costs were up 40%; then, as H1 2018 total revenue was up 46%, its transaction-based costs had fallen to 27%. Thus, given its falling costs, one would expect its adjusted revenue to grow, as we have seen above in the line graph.Now the problem is that there is a limit to how much Square's economies of scale allow for its transaction-based costs to be squeezed out.In other words, there will soon be a point where Square's adjusted revenue growth will match its slower growing total revenue. This might take 12 months or 2 years. However, ultimately its adjusted revenue growth will slow down and be led by its slower growing total revenue.Why is this an issue? Because if Square is a business which is growing mid-50% YoY, it gets priced at a certain multiple, but a business which is growing at 40% gets a different multiple on its share price.My contention is that presently investors are being attracted to management's spiel of how its growth rate is reflected in its strongly growing adjusted revenue, when in fact this metric has benefited from a temporary boost. Nevertheless, management is hoping to price Square's market cap based on the assertion that it is growing at a rate which it is not sustainably able to grow.Source: Author's calculations, morningstar.comOne does not need to have been an investor for a long time to look at the above table and realize that Square's present valuation is out of sync with the rest of its peers. Its P/Cash Flow (from operations (GAAP)) is simply irrationally priced at 360 times. There is simply no justification in its growth rate for it to be priced at this rate.PayPal (PYPL) is obviously growing materially slower than Square. However, PayPal's 3- and 5-year CAGR are both approximately 18%, which implies that its growth rate is significantly more sustainable, thereby offering investors a very rough yardstick as to how Square's cash flow will ultimately approximate as it matures. This also shows that Square is likely to go from being priced above 300X to below 50X, a steep drop in its multiple.In summary, I am not claiming that one should short Square. That is a terrible investment strategy. All I've attempted to discuss is that the company is priced more expensive than all its peers while not growing commensurately, and that its adjusted revenue is benefitting from a non-recurring boost.Author's note: The only favor I ask is that you click the ""Follow"" button so I can grow my Seeking Alpha friendships and our Deep Value network.Disclaimer: Please do your own due diligence to reach your own conclusions."
4208240,22148,2018-09-25T16:29:45-04:00,Square has reached an absurd valuation of $40 billion while 2018 sales estimates are down at only $1.5 billion.Very view analysts have Sell ratings despite the extreme valuation multiples of the stock.The success of Zelle could halt the impressive growth of the Cash app hitting a key growth driver of Square to justify the price even above $45.,"Square (SQ) was a no-brainer stock when the mobile payments provider went going public and traded around $10. The stock, though, appears in more demand now that Square trades near $90 on a rally mostly based on multiple expansion to levels that typically don't end well for investors. Image Source: Square websiteBy all accounts, Square has executed exceptionally well since going public. The issue for investors is getting caught in a momentum trap based on analysts hiking price targets and expectations to irrational levels.In the last couple of weeks, Square has had a couple of analyst upgrades or price target hikes that places the stock at a valuation of $40 billion. Yes, a company that originally guided to net revenues of $1.3 billion for the year is worth nearly 31x those estimates.The scary part is that the analyst community is virtually all bullish on the story despite these elevated valuation multiples. The SA chart below shows how very few analysts have recommendations in the Sell or Underperform levels when the average analyst view should be very mixed at these extreme valuation levels.Source: SA Analyst pageThe average analyst now forecasts that Square could reach revenue levels of over $2 billion next year. Ycharts lists a forward P/S multiple of 17x estimates of $2.15 billion. A very key point here is that a stock that traded below 10x forward sales has seen significant multiple expansion this year in the stock rally from $45 to $90.SQ data by YChartsFor the stock to reach the $100 target of Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell, Square would reach a $47 billion valuation based on 470 million shares outstanding. The forward P/S multiple would actually reach 22x.One only needs to go back to this SA news snippet on how analysts were actually mixed on the stock following disappointing Q1'16 earnings. The analyst at Wedbush trimmed his target to only $9 and J.P. Morgan was seen as bullish with a $14 target. These updates came from just over 2 years ago.The point being that analysts appeared far more rational on the stock when the market cap was only $4 billion and dangerously irrational now when the market cap is nearly 10x higher at $40 billion.The success of the Cash app has the whole banking system pushing the Zelle app. The ability to transfer cash to people with just about any bank account could squash the excitement over future signups of the Cash app. The P2P service has a network of 29 US banks and 119 additional under contract and could squash the growth trajectory of Cash app.According to Cindy Liu of research firm eMarketer, Zelle has already leapfrogged the industry leader in Venmo (PYPL) effectively cutting off the long tail growth potential of Cash app:In July, Zelle announced the P2P money transfer service had reached 100 million transactions worth $28 billion in Q2 alone. The monthly spend on the Cash card continues to surge, but one has to wonder if Zelle doesn't quell the need for consumers to even use the service in the first place going forward. In slowing in the customer spend metric will crush the stock.Source: Square Q2'18 shareholder letterThese data points will provide key clues going forward. Remember that how the momentum trade works is that a certain technology or process goes from assumptions of growth into infinite to suddenly more reasonable expectations either due to competition or regulators.One just needs to look at the other company that Jack Dorsey runs. Twitter (TWTR) went from a must own in the $40s with analysts throwing out price targets in the $50 range to suddenly the stock dipping below $30 on regulator risk and the likelihood of higher costs.The prime example here is how the story can suddenly change. Most people are still bullish on the power and growth potential of the social media platform, but investors are suddenly more cautious on owning the stock. The same could happen to Square when the momentum trade ends.The key investor takeaway is that Square is an insanely priced stock. One of their key growth engines faces a large threat that could potentially knock off all of the long-term growth forecasted for the Cash app. Investors should be careful holding onto this stock when the analyst community is universally bullish at a forward P/S ratio of 20x.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4207522,104662,2018-09-21T05:44:21-04:00,"Square has seen a rapid run, with barely any risk priced in.Litigation concerns regarding swipe fees remain a threat, and could cause double-digit organic revenue loss.Square trades similar to enterprise software stocks, despite a lack of margin strength enjoyed by its peers.Whether or not its growth drivers make up for this industry and valuation weakness isn't clear yet.I believe Square is a Hold unless clarity in the swipe fee litigation occurs.","As this article will focus on negative factors affecting Square (SQ), I first feel it necessary to disclose my holding. Square was one of the first individual stocks I ever bought, and its gains have made it by far my largest holding. With that said, there are a few reasons why Square’s shares do not look attractive at these prices, and in these market conditions. Although I do not plan on selling any time soon, it would be hard to recommend new investors to begin a position now.Below, I will outline the main industry fear that doesn’t appear to be priced in at all, then I will go over the bear case regarding its valuation. After this, I will end this analysis on a high note by going over a few of its growth drivers.Source: SquareThe biggest concern for Square is the ongoing transaction fee disputes that are plaguing Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Despite the recent $6.2-billion settlement with merchants, anti-trust and fee issues are far from over. After the settlement, the National Retail Federation stated,There is still pending litigation revolving business practices, as retailers will plan to fight against the rising swipe fees by arguing the practice falls under anti-trust behavior.Also, Trump and the FTC have increasingly raised anti-trust concerns regarding Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB). If this administration takes a trust-busting turn, then Mastercard and Visa may become easier targets than the tech giants.This isn’t the first time that these issuers have gone to court, but there still remains the risk of regulation disruption. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of American Express (NYSE:AXP) in the summer, although it isn’t likely that its ruling should be seen as an indicator for the current dispute. Kroger (KR) has planned to stop accepting Visa in some California stores, although this will likely backfire and not spread. However, merchants have been attacking these issuers in courts for years, and the risk of them succeeding and lowering swipe fees remains a possibility.Square makes most of its revenue through transaction fees. In the last quarter, transaction revenue reached $625 million, which represented over 75% of its revenue. As a convenience, Square charges a flat fee for all transactions, which allows it to make higher profits on debit cards (low swipe fees) versus credit cards. However, with the trend from debit to credit occurring in America, Square is likely seeing larger amounts of credit cards. Credit card transactions can range anywhere between 1.5% and 2.2% for Mastercard, and even higher for American Express. This leads to somewhere around a 2.93% revenue versus a 2.0% swipe fee for credit cards.Source: Square IRIn exchange for higher fees with Square versus its upstart competitors, customers gain access to all of Square’s ecosystem. This allows Square to see success with its 2.93% transaction-based revenue.If the litigation passes, this 2.93% will be under attack right away. Competitors will lower their prices to account for lower swipe fees, causing a large decrease in revenue in exchange for lower costs. If swipe fees are lowered by 0.25% all around, lower-priced competition will react by changing its fee structure. Square will be forced to lower its fees as well to avoid market share loss. A 0.25% decrease in its fees, resulting in a 2.68% transaction fee, would cause revenue to decrease by over 8%, and likely affect margins. For a company valued based on revenue growth, this could lead to significant pressure on the stock.Of course, the 0.25% reduction in swipe fees is made up. If the litigation is successful, it will be hard to determine what will change in business practices, or how low swipe fees will go. Regardless, it will likely be negative for Square, and allow these lower cost options an opportunity to gain market share.Litigation could be several years, or several months away from being resolved. Even then, merchants will likely sue again if they lose. Trump's mentions of anti-trust concerns may spread to the credit card industry as well. It’s hard to price in this risk, but with negotiations still in progress, it may be wise to wait and see, as Square has little upside to gain based on this.I believe I can sum up most of the bearish valuation concerns by stating that they believe that Square is seeing valuations similar to the (likely) overvalued enterprise software sector, and that this is uncalled for. And it is probably right.Whether Square or its peers are profitable doesn’t seem to matter anymore, and Square has been getting closer to a positive EPS each quarter. However, its P/S ratio is in line with other high growth SaaS vendors, despite the margin differences. Below, I’ll compare other SaaS growth companies with high P/S ratios and high revenue growth, which will include SailPoint (SAIL), ServiceNow (NOW), and Splunk (SPLK).Source: Seeking AlphaSquare has been consistently valued similar to other negative-earnings, high-growth software companies. Square has been expanding in the SaaS space, as its services segment makes up around 16% of its revenue. The quick takeaway would be to claim overvaluation. However, its services segment grew at a 127% rate last year, thanks to acquisitions and new services, which could lead to higher gross margins and diversification away from transaction fees. However, its gross margins won’t reach anywhere near its software counterparts, leading to less certainty in its path to profitability. Discussion on other valuation metrics isn’t necessarily relevant as long as Square remains valued similar to SaaS stocks, as this sector is valued based on revenue growth. A sector-wise correction remains a possibility, as well as a correction in Square to account for its gross margin differences.Again, Square isn’t an enterprise software stock, it just has software offerings. However, I use software stocks in my valuation analysis because I believe this is how the market has been justifying Square’s valuation.Source: SquareAs mentioned before, Square is my largest holding. This means that despite the concerns mentioned above, I believe its growth drivers create a net positive future.Growth drivers include:Unlike software vendors, Square is becoming more diversified, which leads to higher reliability and a lower floor for revenue growth. Revenue and business diversification might make up for its gross margin weakness in its valuations.The fintech landscape is also booming, as several specialized start-ups are continuing to find success in their niches. Based on Square’s recent comments regarding Square Capital, I believe Square may be eyeing a few acquisitions. The first companies that come to mind are millennials-focused investment platforms such as Robinhood, or a smaller one. Square's cash flow makes large investments unlikely, so Robinhood is likely too large.On the lending side, I believe Kabbage is an excellent acquisition target for Square. Kabbage handles small business instant loans and funding, using non-traditional methods for underwriting, such as linking its platform to its customers’ data. Whether or not an acquisition happens, I believe Square Capital will follow a very similar business model as Kabbage, in terms of lending.Source: Kabbage (link here)Square Cash and Caviar are other large growth drivers for Square. Caviar targets the restaurant and bar industry, and its growth rate (100% YoY) suggests it is acting as a disruptor in the industry, and can likely expand its offerings, similar to enterprise software add-ons, in the future. Caviar's and Square’s ecosystems take advantage of vendor lock-in advantages and software add-ons, while lending and financial capability growth will only improve their recurring revenue and vendor lock-in advantages.Square Cash has also expanded to grow beyond Venmo (PYPL), largely due to its bitcoin offerings. If bitcoin comes back, Square Cash revenue could grow substantially. However, its non-bitcoin features represent a high floor in the case of another bitcoin crash.I believe that valuation and industry condition concerns represent a cloudy short-term picture for Square. Current investors won’t see a reason to sell thanks to its growth drivers, while new investors will likely want to wait to see how the swipe fee litigation plays out, and if Trump expands his anti-trust comments to include Visa and Mastercard.Bears will point out its valuation issues, and that it shouldn’t be valued similar to SaaS vendors. Whether or not its revenue diversification, vendor lock-in and add-on capabilities make up for its lack of gross margin is hard to say.A no-news Square sell-off would likely correspond to a sector sell-off in enterprise software, which has grown substantially in the last month and is currently valued on revenue, not profits. Otherwise, a reversion to the mean for Square is unlikely in my opinion, unless it corresponds with a sector-wide sell-off, which is the greater risk. Overall, I believe Square is a Hold and should remain a Hold throughout the quarter, unless clarity in the swipe fee litigation occurs.Disclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

4207161,23998,2018-09-19T12:01:40-04:00,"Square was one of the top 10 names I shared with subscribers in February; over the next 6 months, it was up nearly 80%.
        Now Seeking Alpha contributor Marcello Pinto warns of its high valuation. In light of that, I present two ways longs can limit their risk.
        I also present my site's current take on Square, and comment on a new competitor Square is facing, and why Square longs ought to pay attention to it.","Square-using doughnut shop The Doughnut Project (via Square's Instagram).Shares of Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey's other company, Square (SQ), went on a tear after I shared it as a Portfolio Armor top 10 name with Bulletproof Investing subscribers on February 8th. Seeking Alpha contributor Marcello Pinto recently warned that Square trades at ""nosebleed valuations"" though. In light of his warning, I've posted a couple of ways Square shareholders can stay long while limiting their risk below. I also update my site's current take on Square now, and offer on a comment on a company that could potentially cross Square's moat. And, to avoid any accusations of cherry-picking, I show how the other top 10 names from February 8th did. Safety first though. Let's assume you're long 1,000 shares of SQ and are unwilling to risk a decline of more than 18% over the next several months. Here are two ways of hedging it (screen captures below are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app).Uncapped Upside, Positive CostAs of Tuesday's close, these were the optimal puts to hedge 1,000 shares of SQ against a >18% decline by mid-March.As you can see above, the cost here was $7,250, or 8.24%, calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts. Before you leave a comment saying that this is an expensive hedge:Capped Upside, Negative CostIf you were willing to cap your upside at 19%, this was the optimal collar to hedge against the same >18% decline over the same time frame.You'll notice two things different about this hedge. The first is that, after an iterative process taking into account its net cost, the hedging algorithm was able to find a less expensive put strike, one that lowered the cost of the put leg to $3,800 or 4.32% of position value (calculated conservatively again, using the ask price of the puts). The second is that cost was more than offset by the income of $6,050 or 6.88% of position value, generated from selling the call leg (calculated conservatively, at the bid).So the net cost was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $2,250 when opening this hedge, assuming you placed both trades at the worst ends of their respective spreads.Portfolio Armor's potential return estimates go out 6 months, so we track the performance of them 6 months later. So this chart shows the performance of Square and the rest of the top 10 names from February 8th versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) as of August 8th. As you can see, Square was the top-performing name there, but, on average, the top 10 names returned 25.21%, versus 11.75% for SPY over the same time frame. SQ is no longer a top 10 Portfolio Armor name - it's currently ranked #104, using the same sort of analysis, as you can see in the screen capture from the site's admin panel below, but Portfolio Armor still estimates a potential return of about 25% for it over the next 6 months (actual returns average about 0.3x the site's potential return estimates).As I mentioned above, Marcello Pinto wrote about Square's moat in his article. Chances are, if you've shopped at small retail stores, you've seen Square in action: its equipment looks slick and Apple (AAPL)-like in its aesthetics (futuristic-looking, minimalist, rounded corners, etc.). It's impressive how Square has become ubiquitous in a few short years. As ubiquitous as Square has become in bricks & mortar businesses, another payments company has taken Internet and mobile businesses by storm: Stripe (STRIP). If you're not familiar with it, I wouldn't be surprised: It's not publicly traded yet, Seeking Alpha's symbol for it only has 590 followers, and so far only two Seeking Alpha contributors have written focus articles about it, most recently, Sramana Mitra last month (""Billion-Dollar Unicorns: Is Stripe Ready To List?""). Stripe is, nevertheless, one of the most impressive Silicon Valley startups in the last decade. It is, in Y-Combinator co-founder Paul Graham's famous formulation, a ""schlep business"":The tedious, unpleasant task Stripe took on was handling payments online, which, prior to Stripe, involved integrating your business with a payment gateway, such as Visa's (V) Authorize.net, separate credit card processors, etc.  Image credit: Service Related.Since my site, Portfolio Armor, was built before Stripe started, it uses the old approach, but I can't imagine setting something like this up for a new site. Neither can many online and mobile businesses, which is why Stripe has raised $450 million in venture capital so far. So what does all that have to do with Square, and its Apple-like point-of-sale terminals and credit card readers you see at your local independent coffee shop? Stripe is going to start competing with Square in bricks & mortar. There may be enough potential business for both companies to do well in bricks & mortar, but make no mistake: Stripe is a competitor to keep an eye on."
4205469,21798,2018-09-11T05:12:44-04:00,"Potential investors can be scared away from Square's stock due to the high valuation according to standard metrics.However, the stock price has been tracking revenue growth over time.I expect the stock to achieve above-average gains as Square grows revenue and earnings at strong double-digit rates.","When you have a disruptive company growing at above-average rates, the stock can get highly valued according to standard valuation metrics. That's what we've seen with stocks like Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) over many years. Square (SQ) is another example of an industry-leading disruptor with a high valuation and above-average growth.Investors can easily be scared away from Square's forward P/E of 113 and PEG ratio of 3.54. Those same investors probably avoided Amazon and Netflix as they traded with triple-digit forward P/E ratios for many years. Square's stock tends to correlate well with revenue growth over time. So, I think the stock will continue to outperform the S&P 500 as revenue and earnings grow at a pace that is significantly above average.I do have to acknowledge that Square's stock can experience a pullback at any time. Even outperforming market-leading stocks like Amazon and Netflix experience pullbacks of 5% to 30% occasionally even during bull markets. Social media stocks, Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), and Snap (SNAP) are experiencing sharp pullbacks right now, as their consensus earnings expectations have been lowered.Even with lowered expectations, the social media stocks are still expected to grow revenue at strong double-digit rates. I expect their stocks to recover as they continue to grow at paces that exceed the S&P 500.One risk for Square's stock would be lowered revenue/earnings expectations. This could trigger a sharp sell-off like we've seen with the social media stocks. However, Square is in the payments business. So, the company is subject to a different business dynamic.Another risk for Square's stock is profit taking after such a strong run-up in price. Large investors could sell some shares to lock in profits. However, this would probably result in a smaller pullback of about 5% to 10% as opposed to 20% to 30% from a fundamental reason for lowered revenue/earnings expectations. The social media stocks are taking a hit on the large end of the scale as a result of lowered earnings expectations when their stocks were trading with above-average valuations.The good news for Square right now is that their payments solutions business is thriving. This led to the company exceeding analysts' expectations for revenue and earnings for eight consecutive quarters.Square allows small businesses to accept credit card payments anywhere using mobile phones/devices. This is a game-changer since businesses that used to be cash-only transactions can now offer debit/credit card transactions. This means that businesses that used to be cash-only such as flee markets, farmers markets, nail salons, barber shops, food trucks, food delivery, craft shows, small restaurants/bars, contractor's work, etc., can easily accept debit/credit cards for consumers' convenience.Source: Square Feb 2018 Investor PresentationThis is a win-win situation for merchants and consumers. Merchants can get the benefit of having their customers spend more money since they don't have to rely only on the cash in their pockets. Consumers get the benefit of being able to spend more per transaction without having to carry around a lot of cash.Square gets the benefit of collecting 2.75% in fees for every swiped transaction and 3.5% plus 15 cents for manually entered transactions. The company is likely to benefit from the shift from traditional cash businesses increasingly using debit/credit cards. The use of cash has fallen over time. In 2011, cash accounted for 4 in 10 purchases. However, by 2016, it was down to 3 in 10.Although a total cashless society could be many years away if it happens at all, we are still likely to see a shift from cash to debit/credit cards for small businesses. Global digital payments are expected to increase 10.9% between 2018 and 2020 to 726 billion transactions according to the World Payments Report 2017. This shift should continue since Square makes cashless transactions convenient for small businesses with their payment solutions. I expect Square to achieve strong revenue/earnings growth as this shift continues.The company's Square for Restaurants point-of-sale system is likely to be a positive revenue growth catalyst. Square for Restaurants allows food service businesses to run their businesses more efficiently. The system provides table/menu management, sales tracking, delivery/pickup service management, and convenient payment options for customers. This can be managed from iPads, which includes payment methods for customers. The system allows customers to order from smartphones, mobile devices, or PCs.When restaurants can be run more efficiently, customer service is improved. This will help spur repeat business for those restaurants as customers perceive their experiences to be positive. This represents a strong growth opportunity for Square since there are 660,755 restaurants in the United States as of Spring 2018.Square's growth momentum is evident in the 131% year-over-year increase in subscription and services revenue and 48% increase in total revenue that the company achieved in Q2 2018. These gains did include the effect of the acquisitions of Weebly and Zesty. However, revenue growth still accelerated if the acquisitions were excluded. This demonstrates the health of the core business.While revenue can be a catalyst for the stock, Square is setting up for strong earnings growth in 2019. Earnings are expected to increase 75% to 76% in 2019 (consensus). This is likely to help drive the stock higher as the business appears favorable to investors.The 2019 consensus earnings estimates can be achieved from the 40% expected revenue growth from positive sales momentum, the gross margin of about 38% to 39% and from EBITDA margin improvements that the company has been achieving.Square's balance looks solid as the company has $1.62 billion in total cash and $1.07 billion in total debt. The company has 1.44x more total assets than total liabilities with stockholder's equity of $1.08 billion. The current ratio is strong at 2.18. So, Square looks to be in great shape for handling their short and long-term debt obligations.With the shift from cash to cashless payments continuing, I expect Square to thrive with above-average revenue and earnings growth for the foreseeable future. Small businesses are likely to use Square's payment solutions so that they can make transactions more convenient for customers and to encourage them to spend more. Consumers are likely to increasingly use Square's technology for the convenience of not having to carry around a lot of cash.With the outlook looking strong, I expect Square's stock to continue to correlate with revenue growth over time. Pullbacks of 5% to 25% are likely on profit taking along the way. Larger pullbacks can occur if the stock market experiences a correction or if Square's fundamentals decline.Overall, I expect Square's fundamentals to remain intact. The shift from cash to cashless payments will help Square achieve the consensus estimate of 39% to 40% revenue growth for 2019. I give the stock a one-year price target of $107 for a gain of about 20%.I expect this to be driven by revenue growth, which the stock has correlated well with over multiple years. However, I think the stock growth rate will be less than the total revenue growth rate since a pullback is likely to occur in the stock along the way. The stock has experienced pullbacks of 20%-25% before making higher highs. So, this may happen again after the large run-up in price this year.Let me know your thoughts on the company in the comment section below.

4203377,99026,2018-08-31T09:20:41-04:00,What constitutes a breakout in a stock index?Downside support for the S&P.S&P targets and timing.Don't lose your core equity positions - YET!,"A lot of traders and investors hear the term ""Breakout"" and wonder what it means. Intuitively, we know it means that the market has broken through some type of upside resistance. To use an analogy, imagine a building with three floors, where the market is on the first floor, attempting to break through the ceiling of the 2nd floor. Once it does actually break through what is the ceiling of the first floor and is now on the 2nd floor, the downside support now becomes the 2nd story floor, and the upside becomes the 2nd story ceiling.From an Elliott Wave perspective, we look for a i ii 1 2 setup to occur, then the breakout occurs when the top of the 1 is taken out. To better understand, please refer to the attached chart of the S&P 500 Emini futures contract. Off the April 2018 low, it formed diagonal wave (I), with consolidation, or retracement of this move up as a wave (II) into late June. It then formed another impulsive move up as a purple wave 1 into late July, followed by a shallow purple wave 2 retrace into early August. At this point, it had formed a classic i ii 1 2 setup. Once it takes out the high established by the purple 1, we would consider this a full on breakout, and at no time thereafter would we expect to see it breach the support established by the wave 1 high at 2,850. The next target to the upside is the Fibonacci 1.236 extension at 3,016, and with a few consolidations, the expected target resides at 3,234 to 3,423.Our Hurst timing models suggest that this current move up will conclude in the first quarter of 2019.When breakouts like this occur, we strongly encourage our subscribers to purchase shares of breakout stocks. It's an opportunity to capitalize on the breakout scenario by accumulating profits swiftly, and with very little risk, as the stop out level would quickly become the breakout level itself once the shares show upside follow through. Breakout stocks that we like are Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Coupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP), Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) - see Short Term Momentum Set Ups below.So, if you feel the markets are getting frothy, you're not far off, but there's a good bit of meat left on its bone, so don't lose your core positions - YET! The higher the S&P 500 climbs in the coming months, the less the reward to risk skews for investors, so you'll want to exit equities in the not too distant future, but not yet."
4206631,104376,2018-09-17T09:11:30-04:00,Square is an amazing company with a solid economic moat and a large runway ahead.Management is extremely competent and has a good idea of where it wants to take the firm in the future.Square trades at an extremely high valuation. I don’t believe that there is a margin of safety at current price levels.,"Square was started in 2009 right in the midst of the financial crisis. The company started to enable businesses to take card payments and give all sellers the same resources as larger companies. It launched at the perfect time. The foundation of the company is an ecosystem which allows them to provide a full service, managed payments offering. The company’s growth has been spectacular and there is still a long runway ahead. While Square is not yet profitable, it has grown the top line explosively which will likely translate into massive future earnings. Take a look at the company’s top line growth.Figure 1: The Company’s top line has grown massively every year (Source 10k)One of Square’s key strengths has been their ability to onboard sellers and accept payments immediately. As Square has grown, they allow sellers to run their entire businesses more effectively. Sellers can manage orders, inventory, locations, employees, and payroll; engage customers and grow their sales. They can also gain access to business loans through Square Capital service. Square has partnered with some of the most important financial institutions such as Visa (NYSE:V) which have backed the company from early on. I see this as allowing Square to build on its competitive advantage.Figure 2: Square can onboard clients almost immediatelySquare has a very sophisticated range of hardware options which allows sellers to choose the product that best suits their needs. The company is a lot more than just the small white magnetic Square box it is known for. Here are some of the tools available.•Magstripe reader: The magstripe reader enables swiped transactions of magnetic stripe cards by connecting with an iOS or Android smartphone or tablet.•Contactless and chip reader: This reader accepts EMV chip cards and NFC payments, enabling acceptance via Apple Pay, Android Pay, and other mobile wallets. The reader connects wirelessly or via USB.•Chip card reader: The chip card reader accepts EMV chip cards and enables swiped transactions of magnetic stripe cards by connecting with an iOS or Android smartphone or tablet.•Square Stand: This hardware enables an iPad to be used as a payment terminal or full point of sale solution. It features an integrated magnetic stripe reader, provides power to a connected iPad, and can connect to the contactless and chip reader wirelessly or via USB. Square Stand also connects to various peripheral devices that brick-and-mortar businesses need, such as barcode scanners and receipt printers.Unquestionably, their hardware is up there with the best players in the world to process payments. This technology allows Square to grow its client base and expand the number of merchants that they can reach.The company charges roughly a 2.95% transaction fee for sellers to use its services. This famously came under attack from short-seller Andrew Left. I’m not sure if Andrew is still Short Square, but the stock has nearly doubled since he began targeting the stock. While this is fractionally more expensive than some of its competitors such as Intuit I really don’t believe that this is a massive issue for small businesses. The most important factor for small businesses is the ability to get up and running quickly and begin growing the business. This is one of the major misunderstandings of Andrew Left. Much of the run-up in price is surely due to the company’s near limitless potential to grow. The firm estimates that it has only targeted 3 percent of the addressable market so far.Figure 3: Square’s share price has crushed the market over the last yearMuch of the run-up in price is also surely due to confidence in the management team. Jack Dorsey is a visionary CEO and clearly has an extremely good idea of where he wants to take Square in the future. He also knows exactly where Square stands in the marketplace and how he believes that the firm can continue to grow.Jack reiterates that Square does not compete with companies like Visa and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), but rather that the firm works to increase the number of merchants in the marketplace to grow card payments in general. He also emphasizes that the company competes with family and friends of merchants as some services like Square capital offer loans as small as $6,000. In fact, the whole company is future focused. Here is the management on the firm's growth and expansionI don’t see Square’s core business coming under serious threat anytime soon, and the company has a solid economic moat which will surely allow it to keep growing for years to come. Sure, there is competition, but I don’t see this fundamentally eroding Square’s earnings.My main concern with regards to Square is the valuation. The company trades at a forward earnings multiple of 113 and 14 times sales. By nearly any metric, that is extremely expensive. Since the company is not profitable yet, there is also no way to return cash to shareholders by repurchasing stock or paying dividends. At this price, I don’t think that there is a sufficient margin of safety to invest in Square. While it is a great company, it is probably wise to remain on the sidelines. I would rather invest in a company like PagSeguro (NYSE:PAGS), which I believe has faster growth rates and a much higher margin of safety. Sure, Square could easily continue to rise, but it’s better to be safe than sorry."
4205316,103845,2018-09-10T12:51:12-04:00,"Square is generating more revenue from transaction fees and services offered to customers.Growth in the food industry is sustainable and can be a sustainable source of growth for the company.Its ecosystem is becoming more vertically integrated while offering customers more flexibility, further extending its appeal and reach.","Square (NYSE: SQ) is more than just a company selling card readers; it has a whole ecosystem that businesses are being buying into for handling payment and point of sale (POS). Easy to set up and easy to use, Square has found its way into your everyday experience – just check out your local coffee shop scene. While the app to use Square’s point of sale software is free, its revenues are generated by processing fees and additional services offered.Square’s growth has been driven by its rapid expansion and growth of its POS of sale offerings. Yet I believe that their aptly named newest POS service designed for full service restaurants, Square for Restaurants, represents a product that will generate increase revenues by bringing in larger sellers into the ecosystem and compliment their other two POS systems, aimed at retail and delivery. The main factors driving revenue are the growing proportion of larger sellers joining the Square ecosystem; as of Q2 2018, half of gross payment volume (GPV) came from larger sellers.Fig. 1: Gross Payment Volume (GPV) mix from Q2 Earnings Report.With their sights set on breaking into the restaurant industry, I believe that the revenue growth generated by the restaurant POS will allow for Square’s continued sustained growth. In stark contrast to their traditional, more established competitors, Square offers a powerful, easy to use and straightforward POS system that is robust and efficient. Square has also broken into providing loans to restaurants, providing a vertically integrated ecosystem both provides loans and offers tools for managing revenue for their customers.Additionally, from the restaurateur’s perspective, Square’s food ordering platform, Caviar, handles the troublesome logistics of different customer fulfillment options (pickup, delivery, etc.) seamlessly while preventing creating excessive overhead on the restauranteur’s behalf. In April 2018, Square also acquired Zesty, a white-glove catering option for corporate customers in addition to Caviar for teams, a group ordering option with a shared cart.On August 2, Square announced the Square Reader SDK, a toolkit for developers to bring new applications to the existing Square POS product. By giving freedom to their customers to interface with their existing POS system, Square is creating new avenues for expansion into subsegments with specialized needs. This has already seen applications such as a self-ordering kiosk created by Shake Shack, or a next generation taxi meter capable of fast credit card payments, allowing cab drivers to better compete with Uber or Lyft. This will likely bring on new customers in service industries whose needs were too niche for Square to develop a product in house, but who only require minor modifications to have incorporation into the Square POS system.Fig. 2: Square’s Gross Payment Volume by industry; note that retail and food/drink only represent 41% of payment volume.Lastly, while Square’s Cash App does not handle the same volume of transactions as the POS applications do, it rounds out Square’s product portfolio and gives customers incentive to stay within the Square ecosystem. It competes with other apps in the marketplace such as Paypal’s Venmo and the bank-owned Zelle. However, by offering the Cash Card, a credit card with services and utilities for customers within the Cash App, Square has provided many benefits for regular users to both receive their money and spend it. Since launching in July 2017, monthly spending in June 2018 has increased to $250M, up from $100M in December 2017.Regarding the breakdown of revenue, it is clear that the growth potential of both processing transactions and offering subscription services to its customers are the main two drivers of its remarkable revenue growth. While transaction profits are limited by transaction fees incurred by Square, the subscription and service based revenue will likely be the segment to continue to show phenomenal growth.Fig. 3: Revenue breakdown from Q2 10-Q Form.In conclusion, Square’s most promising drivers of sustainable growth will be its sales of subscriptions to existing customers and converting new large restauranteurs into the Square ecosystem. While the current pricing of the stock appears to be close all-time highs, I believe that the long term current growth rate is well within reasonable limits. Hence, I think we should see the stock reach the $100-120 range in the next 6 months. At the end of the day, businesses want a POS system that is easy to use, relatively cheap and that offers products and services that can scale and evolve as the business grows. For restaurants, having a flexible POS system to handle full service customers as well as various delivery orders with clear metrics and sales summaries will continue to win over larger customers and become Square’s new engine of growth.Not convinced? You might want to pay a little more attention to what’s going on behind the scenes next time you pay with that little Square reader."
4207194,69905,2018-09-19T14:20:38-04:00,"Square's shares continue to rise, but for how long?I question Square's actual profitability.Ultimately, I find Square overvalued.","Square's (SQ) share price continues to incessantly climb. And while Square's revenue continues to grow at a rapid clip, I argue that investors who think Square's shares can offer them a quick double should think again. In fact, investors will be shockingly surprised to know that Square already accounts for this triumphant growth - many times over. Therefore, I recommend that shareholders opt to stay on the sidelines of Square's stock, that its share price now offers nil margin of safety. On the face of it, Q2 2018 delivered a terrific set of results.  Adjusted revenue soared 60% YoY, proving that demand for Square's commerce ecosystem is not only here to stay, but picking up pace at a solid clip. During the Q2 2018 earnings call, CFO Dorsey used the opportunity to highlight to analysts and investors the launch of Square's newest offering, Square for Restaurants. This service follows Square's strong ethos of ease of use. The point-of-sale management tool allows restaurants of all shapes and sizes the ability to make more sales by freeing up time when compared with other back-office support platforms.Next, in spite seeing Square's operating costs jump 45% YoY to $318 million, its bottom line EPS number still succeeded in marginally beating analysts' estimates by $0.01 to $0.13. But this is where the good news ends.Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comAs shown in the above table, the whole sector is very much in favor with the investment community - Wall Street is simply bedazzled. However, ironically, what's even more remarkable is that while I have only listed a few peers in the table, the sector is truly littered with new upcoming competitors.Consequently, while Square is obviously in high demand right now, I question whether Square will still be in high demand tomorrow? And while I do not profess to know the answer to this question, I do not need to know. The table above tells me enough information to persuade me to stay well away.When investing in Square, you are essentially paying more than 12 times its revenue. Think about that for a second. In the past three years, Square's CAGR stood at 38%. Now, investors might argue, as alluded to earlier in the article, that Square is actually picking up pace on the top line, and that its revenue will ""grow into"" its market cap. But I question how fast will Square actually grow? Given the plethora of competition in the space, its growth is unlikely to sustainably remain above 50%, and realistically, much less than 50%. Thus, what are investors actually buying?Assuming that Square continues to benefit from its economies of scale allowing it to leverage off its fixed cost, then, further assuming that management is able to deliver on its target of adjusted EBITDA guidance of $240 million to $250 million for FY 2018, thus, implying H2 2018 delivers a 3% EBITDA margin improvement YoY. And then also, further assuming that Square is able to grow at 50% YoY in 2019, we are in the best case looking at an adjusted EBITDA of $400 million – which leaves its forward EBITDA trading 90 times – which is simply nonsensical and makes it impossible for investors to make a suitable return.At the end of the day, no matter how the narrative is spun on the street, Square is simply not growing anywhere near this level of growth rate. Besides, let’s ponder, what's Square’s adjusted EBITDA metric?At the H1 2018 marker, Square had an adjusted EBITDA of $104 million. However, the largest adjustment to this figure was management's non-cash stock-based compensation of $99 million. In other words, essentially all of Square's adjusted EBITDA came from the assumption that stock-based compensation is either a non-recurring cost (which it obviously is not). Or worse yet, that stock-based compensation is not a real cost to its shareholders. Either way, stock-based compensation, is in mind, a real cost of having Square's management run this business.Additionally, while management touts its $240-250 million in EBITDA for FY 2018, should we consider the 100% increase in capex for H1 2018 to $26 million a regular use of cash? Is this the new capex requirement in Square's investing for growth strategy?Ultimately, there are just too many assumptions and not enough growth in Square's top line, and too little actual profitability. Therefore at a $36 billion market cap, I suggest this stock is best avoided.Author's note: The only favor I ask is that you click the ""Follow"" button so I can grow my Seeking Alpha friendships and our Deep Value network.Disclaimer: Please do your own due diligence to reach your own conclusions."

This movement is powered by fintech, which is the confluence of financial and technology-driven innovation.The world is currently transitioning to a cashless society. We believe this transition will be regarded as one of the biggest investment opportunities of the century. It has already started, but we are still years away from seeing it fully implemented worldwide.The winners are across many horizontals and are subject to constant disruption and innovation. Hence, investors need to have a portfolio-based strategy to make sure they are exposed to several potential key winners.The rise of the App Economy is profoundly disrupting the financial world.Let's review some of the key winners.Image SourceFintech is at the corner of many verticals, from digital payments to online lending to wealth management.According to UBS, digital payments are going to be the main driver of the fintech uptrend in the cashless transition.While there are opportunities for disruption in the insurance or wealth management industry, we are focusing here on the rise of digital payments and the main companies benefiting from it.The growth of digital payments should continue for obvious trends that are deemed to accelerate in the coming years:Image Source: CapGeminiNon-cash payments volume is expected to increase at a CAGR of 10.9% from 2015 to 2020, according to CapGemini and BNP Paribas. Their 2017 World Payment Report is expecting E-Payment (electronic) and M-Payments (mobile) to grow at a CAGR of 18% and 22% respectively.The same study explains that emerging economies in Asia are expected to grow at about 3 times the rate of mature economies. That certainly explains why Warren Buffett just decided to invest $314 million to $357 million (22 billion to 25 billion rupees) for a 3% to 4% stake in One97 Communications, the parent company of Paytm, a digital payments firm based in India.Image Source: CNN MoneyThe dominance and supremacy of digital payments is already happening and inevitable. As described by Henri Grabar on Slate:The stores claiming “we are cashless” are becoming more common by the day. Sweden has already transitioned: it’s the most cashless society on the planet, with bank notes and coins accounting for just 1.7% of its GDP.China is far ahead, with $15.4 trillion worth of mobile payments in 2017. That's more than 40 times the amount processed in the US.Alipay, owned by Alibaba (BABA), handled 54% of those mobile payments, while WeChat Pay, owned by Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), processed 39%.Here is a link to a two-minute video from the Wall Street Journal that explains how these two companies have emerged as global leaders in M-payment.Meanwhile, the US is still lagging behind China on mobile payment adoption. The technology is already here with Apple Pay and Google Pay, but many stores or services have yet to implement the technology. But not for long.According to Recode:Starbucks (SBUX) stands out as an outlier, accounting for around 40% of all mobile payments in America thanks to an innovative reward program.Image Source: RecodeTransaction fees are the main revenue driver at this point, but in the long term, data will be the most important asset.With mobile payments becoming ubiquitous, some companies can amass data at scales never achieved before and collect user information that even Facebook (FB) would look at with envy. If mobile payments are eventually poised to become the dominant form of payment in the world, companies that have the most consumer data will be the best equipped to sell, market and adapt their lines of products and services.Key negative risks of the cashless transition include, but are not limited to:While these challenges should naturally be overcome in the long term, they could prove to create some short term setback.Portfolio management can be broken into two distinct categories – macro and micro.The rise of digital payment is clearly established, but the list of winners of the cashless transition will likely be dynamic due to the emerging nature of the fintech industry. As a result, investors need to have a diversified approach when investing in fintech, ideally with a basket of companies that are poised to benefit from the transition long term.We have broken down below the companies that are – in our view – the best equipped to ride the disruption from the cashless transition:Companies in the chart: Green Dot (GDOT), Square (SQ), PayPal (PYPL), Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), Tencent, Alibaba, Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL).Although Square is the only company in our selection that has yet to be profitable, we believe it is the one that is the most promising.Here are the reasons that make Square our favorite:Cash App vs. Venmo download rankings in the US (Apple iOS app store).

4200340,20521,2018-08-19T06:17:05-04:00,,"For nearly a year now, mobile payments firm Square's (NYSE: SQ) stock has been on the rise. Its recent financial results may not have been spectacular, but the usage metrics continue to impress the market, taking its stock to record highs.For the recently reported second quarter, Square's revenues grew 48% over the year to $814.9 million, ahead of the Street's expectations of $775.4 million. On an adjusted basis, net revenues came in at $385.4 million, compared with $240.4 million a year ago, and $366 million forecast by the market. On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss of $6 million or $0.01 per share, which was significantly lower than the loss of $16 million reported a year ago. On an adjusted basis, EPS of $0.13 was also better than the market's forecast EPS of $0.11.By segment, Transaction-based revenues grew 30% over the year to $625.2 million and Subscription service revenues grew 127% over the year to $134.3 million. Revenues from the hardware segment grew 79% to $18.4 million in the quarter. Earlier this year, Square also ventured into the Bitcoin market by allowing customers to use its app to buy the cryptocurrency. The service is yet to make a big impact in the company's financials. But during the last quarter, it raked in $37 million in revenues with $36.6 million in expenses.Among other metrics, Square's gross payment volume grew 30% to $21.4 billion. During the quarter, it facilitated $390 million of business loans, up 22% over the year. Payment volume from Instant Deposit grew to $4 billion.For the current quarter, Square forecast gross revenues of $840-$860 million, net revenues of $407-$412 million, and EPS of $0.08-$0.10. The Street was looking for gross revenues of $808.3 million, adjusted revenues of $386 million, and EPS of $0.11. Square expects to end the current year with revenues of $3.19-$3.22 billion and EPS of $0.42-$0.46. The market was looking for revenues of $3.11 billion with EPS of $0.46.Square has been counting on the new product releases and tie-ups with other retailers and etailers to drive growth. It is already seeing strong adoption for its peer-to-peer cash transfer app CashApp, which was launched in December last year. CashApp is connected to a credit card and allows users to transfer funds to others using this credit card. It also added more services to the app by focusing on financial services for the underbanked. It allows users to store money in a virtual account and has given them a virtual routing and account number to receive direct deposits. It has also given them a debit card and allows them to store money in the form of bitcoins instead of US dollars.CashApp has become a strong competitor for PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) service Venmo, which is yet to adapt its services to the emerging market trends. Square did not disclose the number of users for CashApp, but the service saw spending grow to $250 million in the recent quarter. The service is already ahead of Venmo in the number of downloads. According to data from SensorTower, cumulative Cash App downloads amounted to 33.5 million as of the end of July, compared with 32.9 million for Venmo.To get better inroads into the small business segment, Square has tied up with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) to launch a lending program. As part of the tie-up, eBay sellers will be able to raise up to $100,000 in loans from Square. It also launched a special app called Square for Restaurants, which will focus on the restaurant industry to improve their point-of-sale offerings.Finally, Square is expanding its geographical reach. It is currently present in only five markets of the US, Canada, Japan, the UK, and Australia. It is working on growing awareness about its products in the UK and Australian markets.The market is pleased with Square and any doubts over Jack Dorsey managing to turnaround Square appear to have been put to rest. Its stock has grown nearly 165% over the past twelve months. It is currently trading at 52-week high levels of $72.76 with a market capitalization of $28.2 billion. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $24.22 it had fallen to nearly a year ago."

You may have also seen the clean and crispy shiny white stand holding an iPad, and have it swung around to you so you can hastily jot down your signature and one-touch add a tip. If you haven't paid too much attention before now, know that you were interacting with Square (NYSE:SQ).Square is a payments processor that has become so much more than just a credit card swipe to pay for baked goods at a bake sale, and has evolved into a small business management platform.Initially launching with payment processing, and giving away free $10 readers, Square now boasts a whole suite of tools for small businesses, including:All of these streams of revenue seem to be paying off for Square as well. On the Q2 earnings, Square's earnings per share came in at $0.13, beating estimates by $0.01, and they had revenue of $385 million, up 60% year over year, and beating revenue estimates by $17.41 million.So with all of these positives, why should you be looking for a market correction for Square?Outlook for Square doesn't look too hot, at least in the short term. When analyzing the stock with our financial models, the 5-year EBITDA Discounted Cash Flow model shows a 20% downside to the stock, with a price target of $53.67 from its last close of $66.86. This is coming from revenue, as well as growth velocity. It also seems that a rating from Credit Suisse may have an impact as well, with the bank putting only a 15% upside on a very volatile stock, and such a small upside would be a reason to sell. (If the upside was 100%+, then that is a reason to double down)With industry peers not really able to match Square's offering, as well as no real comparables company-wise, we feel Square might be misjudged. They are bringing in more revenue than ever, and are starting to expand and really create an entire ecosystem around their platform, much like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has done. Once you are on it, it's incredibly difficult to leave.A fantastic entry point for this stock would be in the $55-$60 range, allowing you to get in on the downswing, and then hold tight for upswings once they start to beat estimates even more.Gross payment volume rose 30% year over year, transaction-based revenue was also up 30% year over year, a major profit center, subscription based revenue was up a massive 127% year over year, and the Cash App customers spent $250 million with Cash Card.Take a seat, grab a latte and read your digital receipt, because once Square pulls back, the time to swipe up shares will be then."
4202278,104746,2018-08-27T11:56:15-04:00,"With Cash App improving with features such as Cash Card and Cash Boost, there's increased revenue and increased spending with the card.Square has lots of potential to continue growing at its rapid pace.Square’s ability to constantly innovate and improve all of its products keeps it ahead of all of its competitors.Once spending on growing and expanding slows down, profit is set to explode.","Square (SQ) is a stock that investors will be looking back on in 10 years, wishing they'd had the foresight to invest in it. Since it made its debut in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in November2015 it has risen almost 450%, and in two years to date, almost 500%. This extreme growth can turn some investors away with the fear of Square hitting its peak and plateauing, but this stock has a lot more to grow before it’s done. As Square grows it continues to better itself by constantly improving upon its already existing services and by adding new ones. Square has yet to hit anywhere near its potential as it's still spending its gains on growth. Not only is this the case, Square has many products in many industries that are set to boom in the years to come.Square has yet to have a profitable quarter in its years as a publicly traded company, but many expect to see that change in the near future. Since Square is still a relatively new company - started in 2009 - lots of its early years required spending on research and developmentand on expanding the company itself. Now nearly 10 years later, the company no longer has the need to throw money into these early stage problems. Obviously there will still be money going into expansion as well as R&D, but much less will be needed as time moves on. Proof of this was reported in Q2 earnings, as the net loss for the second quarter was only $6 million compared to the $24 million in the previous quarter. Although they have been increasing their quarterly revenue at a relatively steady rate, the cut in losses is thanks to a dramatic cut in unnecessary spending. Image Source: Q2 Earnings ReportIn Square's recent earnings report, Q3 and 2018 guidance didn’t make shareholders happy. With a lower EPS and a higher net loss per share than expected, shareholders believed that the company wasn’t doing as amazingly as had been thought. This would be the case had revenue not been higher than expected proving that business is better than ever. The reason for this off-putting information is not because of horrible management or lower user base but rather because of the path Square is choosing to take. Square has decided to reinvest its gains to focus on growth rather than focusing on short-term profits. For this reason, I believe the guidance was actually quite excellent yet was being misread by shareholders. With these growth stocks, many choose to take short-term profits to please shareholders, yet I believe Square has taken the route to becoming an influential company rather than one that plateaus into nothing.Square makes money through its services quite efficiently and without disrupting the user. Square adds on 1% for each expedited deposit, and for businesses charges start at 2.75% per each transaction using a card as well as 15 cents in addition to 3.5% for manually entered transactions. This allows Square to earn money off of its service without providing any unnecessary inconvenience to its clients. However that isn’t the only way that Square is making its money. Bitcoin is very lucrative for the company. They reported $420,000 in profits last quarter just from selling Bitcoin alone through Cash App. To expand on this, Square also began using private brokers to buy and sell their Bitcoin and expanded that particular service to all 50 states. Square has partnered with companies such as Shake Shack in order to offer incentives through their Cash Boost program giving them another way to make money. Although Square's plan to make money seems great, Square has still yet to see profit.Some come to the conclusion that Square's lack of profit and stock prices at all-time highs make the stock not buyable. A point I hear often against Square is that it's ""overbought and over valued,"" which I understand. As for the overvalued argument, I believe that is true to the shallow eye. People may see Square as overvalued as it's still yet to see a profitable quarter and it's reaching all-time highs. Despite Square's extreme growth this year, shareholders will continue to buy for what is to come in the future. With an increased product line, a focus on growth over short-term profit, and reinvesting its gains on improvement, shareholders know that this stock will see huge profit in the relatively near future.Square shareholders have fought outsiders looking in on whether or not the stock is good. Shareholders believe this stock is the holy grail of stocks while outsiders think there are holes in the company's profile. With a lack of profit yet stock prices at all-time highs, many believe that Square is overvalued. This is a fair point that's stated a lot in the bear market. To go along with this, Square's Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been over 70 for a little while making it overbought, worrying analysts. Bears believe Square stock will fall back to the 60s before it can make a push back up. Overall, risks to investors include Square being overbought, lacking a profitable quarter, and growth that's hard to continue at its rate. Although there are arguments against Square, I believe the reward outweighs the risk as the risks are mainly short term.Square has focused on growing their presence by expanding into fields with a promising future. With a growing delivery market, Square has created Caviar, its food delivery courier. Another venture Square has created is off of Cash App's extreme success, and it plans on capitalizing on this opportunity in more ways than one. For starters, Square has made additions to Cash App such as Bitcoin conversion to keep it growing and allowing it to part from other peer-to-peer transaction apps.To continue on the point of expansion, Square has made sure that Caviar is the best food delivery app for both the restaurant and the customer. With Caviar taking over the logistics of ordering so that the restaurants can focus on food, many restaurants have decided to solely use Caviar. Because of these great improvements, revenue in Q2 has more than doubled year over year. With a growing food delivery market that's expected to be worth $15.5 billion by year 2022 Square has made sure to capitalize on this. Of course, even with expansion, Square has stayed true to its roots and continued to create card readers. These card readers have brought in $18 million in revenue through selling just the hardware and $625 million through transactions. As Square's leading product, Square has continued to update these readers to create a perfect environment for both the vender and customer. These card readers now have the ability to read chips in two seconds rather than over 10 with competing readers. Overall, these updates are sure to bring in even more revenue. I imagine that hardware revenue will reach $25 million and transaction revenue will reach $1 billion by Q2 2019.To continue to grow, Square has spent their gains rather than focusing on short-term profit. In continuation of expansion growth, Square has acquired Weebly, a web development site, to grow into the web design field. This, I see as a waste as Weebly was acquired for $365 million, money they could have spent on improving other sections. With websites slowly dying and apps growing, I see this as a waste unless they can create Weebly into a app development site. All in all, I love the route that Square has taken by focusing on growth over everything else.With Square, there's a profuse number of reasons to invest. With technology that's proving to be the best in its field, and growing user base and growing revenue, there are many reasons to buy Square. For Square stock, outsiders and shareholders have argued whether this is a buy or sell, overvalued or undervalued, hit its peak or nowhere near settling. Many see its lack of profit as a growing problem without realizing the direction Square has decided to take. As I have said over and over throughout this article, Square's management team is reinvesting its gains rather than focusing on short-term profit. I will continue to remind shareholders and traders alike that their lack of profit is not an issue, rather a decision. With Square's amazing product line, profit would be as easy to come across as a snap of the fingers. On another note, although thought of as overvalued and over bought, I would heavily disagree. Again, many believe Square stock is overvalued due to its lack of profit and growth of 165% in the last year. As shareholders see, the stock is in fact undervalued as Square is the best growth stock in recent times. This being said, Square has spent money effectively as their net income loss is down to $6 million. Even though Square has focused on growth, I believe their product line will be able to bring in profit in as little time as Q1 2019. With all of these products, Square has extreme upside to go along with amazing management. For these reasons I believe Square is an investment that will pay off heavily in as little as Q2 2019 yet also an investment that can last 10 more years."
4194371,20049,2018-08-03T10:32:15-04:00,A look at Apple's milestone.A look at a trade for clients.An interesting new fund from WisdomTree.,"By virtue of closing above $207.05, Apple (AAPL) is now worth one billion trillion gazillion dollars.There is some precedent for this sort of milestone to coincide with market tops. Cisco (CSCO) today has a $200 billion market cap, down from $500 billion in 2000 when it was briefly the largest company in the S&P 500. This is not about trying to predict anything, but this sort of excitement is simply a negative. There is always a bull case and a bear case to be made for equities, and I would add this to the bears' side. But if somehow the market is topping, I would say it is more of a coincident indicator bordering on curiosity. I will be interested to see if it matters or not, but understanding the history is worthwhile.The other day I mentioned owning Square (SQ) for clients and how it had a rough day. This was Monday. That post was about whether the market was on shaky ground and not selling into a mini-swoon. However, I decided that day that I would sell on the next pop, which came Thursday. I sold kind of early in the day so didn't get a great price relative to the day, but it was a huge gainer. I bought late last year around $40. An eight-month hold is very short for me; I have quite a few holdings for clients that go back to 2004/2005.Clients have owned Mastercard (MA) for many years, and I perceive a lot of overlap there. Both stocks are featured in the ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF (IPAY), so there is a fair bit of overlap there. I've also been concerned that we are close to the equity market cycle ending, and I am convinced that whenever the bear starts, Square will get pummeled. Mark Yusko is fond of Tweeting that risk happens fast, and I believe SQ is vulnerable to that idea. I would much rather regret selling it too early than regret holding on too long if risk does end up happening quickly in the name.There was a wave of excitement in the part of Twitter where I hang out on Wednesday when Fidelity announced two new broad-based, equity, traditional mutual funds that will have no expense ratio - Fidelity ZERO℠ Total Market Index Fund (FZROX) and Fidelity ZERO℠ International Index Fund (FZILX). Mike Venuto from Toroso shared some insight at ETF Trends on how Fidelity might still make money from them, but I think what might be more interesting is that as traditional funds, Fidelity can have the assets be captive at their firm, Venuto mentioned that the Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF (SCHB) only charges 0.03% with better tax efficiency. The idea that all of this is a race to zero in terms of expense ratios and commissions makes sense, and even if not literally zero, a portfolio can be constructed for peanuts now, which is a great and democratizing thing, and if it gets cheaper or more funds, narrower funds, also drop to 5, 10, 15 basis points, then all the better.Speaking of democratization, WisdomTree has been doing some increasingly interesting things with strategic ETFs. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about ways to use and misuse leverage. WisdomTree's latest fund appears to take a stab at using leverage constructively. The WisdomTree 90/60 Balanced Fund (NTSX) is trying to enhance the 60/40 portfolio. From the literature, it tries to more efficiently capture a 60/40 portfolio by putting 90% in equities and 10% into Treasury bond futures such that the notional value works out to a 60% exposure. They make a point of saying that this then allows for some sort of alternative overlay, or really any alpha seeking overlay whether that be nominal or risk adjusted. If you just read that and you're thinking ""yewhatnow"", Jake @EconomPic figured this out back in November when the concept was discussed on Twitter:The idea is very interesting to me, but I am not sure implementing a leveraged strategy like this one, constructive as it may be, nine and half years into a bull market is a great idea. Also the Treasury futures currently in the fund expose it to interest rate risk. NTSX is actively managed, and although the process is quantitative, perhaps they can actively manage the interest rate risk.For now, I think the type of leverage using the Salt truBeta High Exposure ETF (SLT) (linked above) might make more sense if we are in fact late in the cycle. The idea there was 40% in SLT and 60% in bond proxies (actually equates to 50/50) because SLT leverages up with beta not notional exposure. Play around with the numbers, but some mix of SLT and fixed income favoring the fixed income would seem to more defensive. NTSX mixed with an effective market neutral strategy could be a way to overcome the issue I am raising.After a large equity decline, I think NTSX could make a lot of sense."
4193392,67855,2018-08-02T07:00:12-04:00,"Headline numbers were great. Both revenue and EPS beat analyst estimates.Gross payment volume growth continued to fall. 30% isn't bad by itself, but it's the worst in the company's public history.Service revenue increased significantly, boosting the company's profitability with its superior margins.Bitcoin didn't live up to the hype, with revenue just $3 million higher than that of Q1.I am impressed with the company's growth in services, but with GPV growth deceleration continuing this quarter, I am not buying the company's premium valuation.","Square’s (SQ) Q2 earnings beat analyst estimates across the board. The $385 million of revenue was $17 million higher than the $368 million estimate and adjusted EPS of $0.13 was $0.02 better than the consensus of $0.11.Profitability probably never mattered much to investors at this stage, but revenue came in meaningfully above analyst expectations, which should signal better than expected growth ahead relative to analyst estimates. Despite the positive headlines, the immediate reaction was quite muted, with the stock fluctuating around the close in after-hours trading.Overall I liked the quarter, but I didn’t see anything that would change my mind about the company’s expensive valuation (read Square: High Risk, High Valuation).Gross payment volume growth continued its quarterly decline. The company grew its volume by the 30% year over year to $21.4 billion, while impressive by itself, this was in fact the slowest growth the company has ever experienced. For comparison, PayPal grew its volume by 27% in Q2, and the dollar value of the growth was more than six times that of Square ($31.6 billion vs. $5 billion)Below is a graph of showing Square’s GPV growth since its IPO.Source: data from company press release and conference callsIn less than three years, growth has declined from 45% to just 30%. Keep in mind that Square processes just 15% of PayPal’s (PYPL) volume, meaning that if it is having trouble growing at a rapid pace today, growth will likely taper off quickly as the company matures.Service revenue has become an increasingly important part of Square financially. Revenue from services grew 127% year over year to $134 million, trouncing the growth of transaction revenue, which increased in line with GPV, rising 30% to $625 million.Service revenue also carries much higher margins compared to the core payment business. Gross margin for services expanded year over year to 70% from 69% in Q2 2017. Contrast this with transaction revenue’s margin of 37%, continued growth of service revenue is clearly critical to Square’s success.What could make Square more appealing is if the company discloses the makeup of the service revenue, as business from “mission critical” services like payroll is much more sticky than, say, Square Capital, which is just another name for the highly commoditized merchant advance service.While revenue may pick up in the future if Square’s Cash app becomes a dominant Bitcoin trading platform, it was no doubt a disappointment this quarter. Revenue from Cash app’s Bitcoin operation was a mere $37 million, a $3 million increase form Q1.Based on the how the stock reacted to Bitcoin developments in late 2017, I think investors wanted a little more than a measly $3 million dollar increase quarter over quarter.If the management wants to write a completely new platform to wrestle away business from established Bitcoin exchanges, it could be another leg to the Square story; but based on Q2’s revenue numbers, I foresee negligible value in Square’s cryptocurrency effort.Growth at Square’s core payment service continued to decline; however, the strong growth in services more than made up for it. If the current trend continues, revenue from services will eclipse Square’s core payment business in several years, which should theoretically make the company a lot of valuable given the 70% gross margin. However, I believe that such a projection fails to recognize that services are an extension of payments. Square is ramping up the monetization of its users by introducing ancillary services, but if the core payment business flounders, there won’t be a service business left. As I discussed in my previous article, iZettle is PayPal’s response to Square and if Square doesn’t take action soon, it could experience an existential crisis. I suspect that iZettle’s ability to tap PayPal’s vast amount of wallets on-premise will make it a meaningful alternative to Square; as such, I believe that investors still need to pay attention to GPV growth.Overall, I am impressed with the company’s services revenue growth, but the decline in GPV growth means that I still can’t quite agree with the stock’s premium valuation."
4188596,103511,2018-07-20T00:29:43-04:00,"Recently I did a Q&A interview with Sam Quigley, Square's Risk and Security Lead and a member of Square's executive management team.The Executive Interview series provides you with firsthand insight into the technology industry through discussions with newsmakers, industry leaders, and experts themselves.Founded in 2009 and IPO'ing in 2015, Square is a financial services company focusing on merchant services aggregation and mobile payments. It currently has a roughly $28 billion market capitalization.We discussed Square's various business segments and products, its history, growth trajectory targets and plans, and what makes it distinct from other mobile payment transactions services.","The Executive Interview series, as part of Tech Investment Insights, provide you with exclusive interviews with newsmakers, industry leaders, and experts in the technology industry.Interviews do not imply endorsement of the company, its products, or any associated securities. Rather, it is meant to provide you more information for your consideration from those currently directly in the industry itself.Recently I had the opportunity to do a Q&A interview with Sam Quigley, who oversees engineering, product management, and data science for risk and information security at Square (SQ). He is a member of Square's executive management and has worked at Square since 2010, previously serving as Head of Information Security before becoming Risk and Security Lead.Square is a financial services company focused in particular on merchant services aggregation and mobile payments transactions. It had over $70 billion in gross payments volume in the past 12-months and currently has a public market capitalization of over roughly $28 billion.Through a variety of software applications and hardware products it was one of the first companies to allow mobile credit card transaction processing through its ""Square Reader"" hardware add-on. Currently operating in a variety of software and hardware products both on the merchant and user side, it offers an array of B2B, user-merchant, and user-to-user services and products as well as other payments support, financing, and processing mechanisms.It was founded in 2009, IPO'ed in 2015, and is headquartered in San Francisco. It was founded by Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey who also is CEO and Chairman of Square.(Source: Square)Q: What is your history and current role with Square?A: I lead risk and information security at Square as a member of the company's executive team.I’ve been interested in computers and what makes them work (and break!) since I was a kid. While I originally planned to get a computer science degree at the University of Chicago, I found a passion for philosophy and changed my major. I know this is pretty non-traditional training for information security, but I’ve found that my philosophy background has really been a strength. Having an open mind, thinking critically, and approaching problem-solving from every possible angle is incredibly helpful for success with high-stress, complicated security issues. For me, it’s been a huge advantage. And I think what’s great about Jack is that he also greatly appreciates and values this approach.I joined Square in 2010 as the first information security hire, and today I lead a variety of teams and products at the company including information security, risk, operations, and machine learning infrastructure. For the 10 years prior to Square, I held security leadership positions at a number of tech companies including both product and consulting companies.Q: Since its founding in 2009 Square has significantly disrupted the payments space, particularly in mobile. What do you think has led to Square's success, especially in a payments industry long considered difficult to enter?A: Our trust-first approach. At Square, we’ve always sought to create an inclusive environment for our customers—this may not initially sound groundbreaking, but it is when you realize we wanted to incorporate this trust into risk management. We wanted to bring more sellers onto Square and into the financial system. And we were able to achieve that objective: Square’s seller acceptance rate is more than 95% whereas the industry standard is less than half of that. Importantly, we’ve been able to do it safely by using data science and machine learning to effectively manage risk. This has enabled us to create an entirely new market that has resulted in the millions of businesses and individuals that Square serves today.Q: Square has seen almost $70 billion in gross payment volume pass through it in the past 12 months. How would you describe Square's business model and how it makes money?A: Square is a cohesive ecosystem of tools that help sellers start and grow a business: payments and point of sale, hardware, and software services such as marketing, appointments, e-commerce, payroll—the list goes on. We charge either a transaction, subscription, or service fee for the product—we do what makes the most sense for Square and for our sellers. For example, with Square Invoices we charge a transaction fee. That means that a seller pays only for the invoices they send. Some invoice products have monthly subscription fees, which means a seller pays for the product even if they don’t send an invoice in a given month. And what’s great about our products is that they’re designed to grow with our sellers. And when our sellers grow, we grow.What’s even more exciting is that we’re also building an ecosystem of financial tools for individuals with Cash App. Cash App began as a peer-to-peer service that allowed people to send and receive money with their friends and family. In the past couple of years, we’ve built upon and expanded beyond that. Cash App now has a Cash Card, which is a Visa prepaid card that customers can use to spend the balance they store in Cash App. They can even use the Cash Card to withdraw money at an ATM. We’ve also added the capability for customers to receive direct deposit payments, such as those from an employer, and customers can buy and sell bitcoin in Cash App.As we reported in our first quarter earnings, Square is continuing to scale and growth is accelerating with Adjusted Revenue of $307 million, up 51% year over year.Q: What are Square's business goals, both in the short-term and the longer-term?A: At the highest level, all of our business goals are oriented toward our purpose of economic empowerment. We believe that everyone should have the tools to participate and thrive in the economy.In the more near term, we’ve outlined three focus areas for this year. First, we want to strengthen our omnichannel commerce capabilities to enable our sellers to engage with buyers wherever they are: in person, messaging channels, websites and apps, and digital marketplaces. This was the driver of our acquisition of Weebly in May—the company’s tools and technology make it easy for anyone to build a professional website or online store. Second, we want to provide more financial services to sellers and individuals, particularly those who have been underserved by the traditional financial system. We see a great opportunity here with Square Capital and Cash App. And third, we’re going to continue to grow our current international markets of Australia, Canada, Japan, and the UK.Q: What makes Square stand out from competitors in the payments space, particularly other digital and mobile-oriented ones such as PayPal and Apple Pay?A: What sets Square apart is the cohesion of our ecosystem. A seller can come to Square and receive the products they need to start and grow a business, and more importantly the products are integrated and designed to work together seamlessly. For example, one of our newest products, Square Register, is an all-in-one solution of payments, point of sale, and hardware. With other providers, a merchant would have to at least three different vendors plus a bank to get all of those services.We also place a large emphasis on enabling our sellers to not just take payments, but to manage payments, and this begins from the moment they begin using Square. Square serves as the merchant of record for our sellers and handles security, PCI compliance, dispute management, and up to $250 in monthly chargeback protection. This enables our sellers to focus on their customer and making the sale.And I just want to correct that Apple Pay is not a competitor! Like magstripe or EMV chip cards, Apple Pay is one of the many payment types that sellers can accept with Square.Q: Are there any particular Square products that you believe have been most successful in recent times, as well as any upcoming sub-sectors that you think may be particularly worth watching?A: Well, because I’m the risk and infosec guy, one of the Square products that I’m really proud of is mobile PIN, which is the ability to accept a personal identification number on a mobile device. When Square entered the UK and Australia markets, we needed to provide our sellers there a way to accept payments that use PINs to authenticate chip card transactions instead of signatures (which are used in the U.S.). So we actually built a new way to enter PINs into the Square app on a mobile device. This solution is secure and easy to update because it’s software based, ensuring that our sellers always have access to the latest and safest technology. Furthermore, mobile PIN eliminates the need for expensive hardware PIN pads, which makes card acceptance more accessible and aligns with our purpose of economic empowerment. Along the way, we’ve worked with industry partners to evolve standards for this new mobile PIN acceptance capability, which is the first of its kind for payments.Q: How do you think cryptocurrency is transforming the payments space? How is Square handling cryptocurrency's recent rise?A: As you mention, there are a few dimensions to this, and I’ll start at the highest level which is what does this mean for the payments industry? Cryptocurrency, because of the underlying technology of blockchain, can bring transparency, accessibility, and lower cost to payments. These aspects can make things like cross border transactions, which are currently very difficult, much easier. And of course we’re always looking for ways to increase transparency and accessibility at Square, so we’re also examining how blockchain can be applied to our own processes and projects. From a customer perspective, we heard from them that they wanted an easy way to buy and sell Bitcoin, so we built this functionality into the Cash App earlier this year. In doing so, we were able to make this financial service available to more people.SQ data by YChartsSQ Market Cap data by YChartsExplore other segments of Tech Investment Insights' Executive Interview series below:"
4192192,67855,2018-07-30T21:18:33-04:00,"Square's valuation is way to high for its risks.
        Volume growth is slowing despite its small scale, this does not bode well for future growth.
        The company is not yet profitable, but its take rate is higher than that of PayPal.
        PayPal could aggressively market iZettle, which will likely negatively impact Square's take rate.
        Q2 results won't be affected, but investors will be forced to look at these issues when the iZettle acquisition closes in the third quarter.","Square (SQ) is slated to report earnings this Wednesday and investors will continue to look for growth. I have no doubt that the company will continue to grow, but at what point will investors start to pay attention to its valuation?The stock has been on a tear after a brief post-IPO slump, sending its already high valuation multiples into the stratosphere.I can understand where bullish investors are coming from as Square is the only pure-play small-business payment, however, I fail to see how the current valuation justifies its risks.Gross payment volume (GPV) is still growing nicely every quarter, but the pace of growth has decelerated from 34% in Q1 2017 to 31% in Q1 2018. Note that this growth excludes the exit of Starbucks in 2016, which had accounted for more than 10% of GPV. Today no significant portion of Square’s GPV is concentrated in just one customer, so subsequent GPV growth can be seen as strong secular growth.While ~30% growth is indeed impressive on the surface, is it that impressive when we compare to its peer PayPal (PYPL)? Square processed just 13.5% of PayPal’s volume in Q1 ($17.8 billion vs. $132 billion), yet growth was just 400 bps higher (31% vs. 27%).As I stated in my article about PayPal, volume growth is key for future profits as payment processors have high operating leverage. The fact that Square’s volume growth is already slowing down at this stage does not bode well for its future. If Square is growing volume just a hair higher than PayPal despite its smaller size, I fail to see why it deserves its premium valuation today.Even though Square is not profitable on a GAAP basis today, it actually has a transaction take rate that is meaningfully above that of PayPal. Square’s transaction take rate in Q1 was 2.94%, a whopping 56 bps higher than PayPal’s 2.38%. While 56 bps seem small, it is significant given the sheer dollar amount processed. Based on Square’s volume of $17.8 billion in the first quarter, every 1 basis point equates to $1.78 million, or 0.3% of Square’s transaction revenue.The management has always given analysts the runaround on whether this level of take rate is sustainable. For example, below is an exchange between the CFO and a JP Morgan analyst in May:While it’s true that Square has a software business attached to the core payment business, at the end of the day, take rate is still a big part of a customer’s decision. Just as every 0.01% is meaningful to Square, it is also meaningful to its customers.I believe that Square will be able to maintain its high take rate in the short-term because presently there is no meaningful competition for a straight forward on-premise payment processor. If a small business wants to accept electronic payments without any commitment, Square is the obvious choice. However, I believe that the competitive dynamic will soon change.While PayPal has not yet spoken about its plans for iZettle in detail (likely due to the fact that the transaction has not yet closed), I believe that the logical step with this acquisition is to aggressively grow its on-premise business. Because PayPal’s on-premise presence is basically non-existent right now, aggressive marketing (i.e. through a highly competitive take rate) will not be dilutive to PayPal’s core business. I believe that this will likely pressure Square’s take rate in the long-run.If Square were to give up just half of its 56 bps advantage over PayPal, its transaction revenue will decline by 10%. I believe that constitutes as a meaningful headwind.I believe that Square does not deserve its premium valuation today given its slowing growth and potential take rate compression stemming from competitive pressure.While the effects that I just described will unlikely be felt this quarter, investors will have to be on high alert as the impending catalyst for escalating competitive pressure is just around the corner with PayPal’s expected close of the iZettle acquisition in the third quarter. ."
4181600,23998,2018-06-14T09:05:44-04:00,"Square was one of the top 10 Portfolio Armor names I presented to Bulletproof Investing subscribers last December. Since then, it's up nearly 71%.To head off questions of cherry-picking, I show how the rest of that December top names cohort has performed so far and offer a broader look at top names' performance.I also discuss the analysis that made Square a top name in December, and what that analysis says about it today.Finally, in light of its big run-up, I share a couple of ways Square longs can limit their downside risk from here.","Square-using doughnut shop The Doughnut Project (via Square's Instagram).Shares of Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey's other company, Square (SQ), hit new highs on Tuesday in the wake of the company revising its guidance upward last week. Square is now up nearly 71% since I shared it as a top 10 name with Bulletproof Investing subscribers last December. In light of its huge run-up, I've posted a couple of ways Square shareholders can stay long while limiting their risk below. First, anticipating accusations of cherry-picking, here's a look at how the top 10 names I've presented to subscribers so far have done. Next, we'll look at the analysis that made Square a top name, and how the rest of December 14th top names cohort including Square has done so far. And then before we get to the hedges, we'll look at what my system's current analysis says about Square going forward.Each week since June 8th of last year, I've been presenting Portfolio Armor's top 10 names to my Bulletproof Investing subscribers. These are the names that, out of the subset that is hedgeable against single-digit declines, the site estimates will have highest potential returns over the next 6 months. So far, their 6-month performance has been fairly strong, as you can see in the table below. You can find an interactive version of this table on this page of my website, where each of the starting dates is linked to a chart showing the performance of every top name from that cohort. I've removed all but one of the links from the table below, to comply with Seeking Alpha's limits on links; the link I've kept is for the worst-performing cohort so far, so you can see that my system doesn't always get these picks right.So Portfolio Armor's top ten names averaged 16.23% over the average of these 27 6-month periods versus SPY's average of 9.40%, an average outperformance of 6.83% over 6 months.The December 14th cohort will be added to that table on June 14th, but here's what it looked like when I posted on Bulletproof Investing then. I'm posting this here so you can get a sense of the analysis that went into making Square a top name then.My system relies on price history and options market sentiment to rank securities. The ""6m Exp Return"" column in the table above represented the mean of the most recent 6-month total return for each security, and its average 6-month return over the last 10 years, with that long a history. Since Square didn't have that long a history, one of its competitors (as determined by Nasdaq), CA (CA), was used as a long-term proxy.The next step in this analysis was as a gauge of options market sentiment, attempting to find an optimal, or least expensive, collar to hedge Square over the next several months using the 6m Exp Return figure as a cap. When that test was successful, that was considered Square's potential return. Essentially, the site started with an assumption of mean reversion and then checked with the options market to see if that assumption looked plausible, and it did. Next, the hedging cost was deducted, and based on Square's potential return net of hedging cost, it ranked among the site's top 10 on December 14th.It's logical to assume mean reversion in security returns because that's the general trend, as financial advisor and Forbes blogger Lawrence Hamtil points out in the tweet below.But mean reversion doesn't happen all the time, and in Square's case, over the last 6 months, it has shot higher instead. Square has outperformed all of the other top names from the December 14th cohort with Insperity (NSP) trailing it by a few basis points. On average, the top 10 have outperformed the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by more than 22%, as you can see below.SQ is no longer a top 10 Portfolio Armor name - it's currently ranked #141, using the same sort of analysis, as you can see in the screen capture from the site's admin panel below, but Portfolio Armor still estimates a potential return of about 26% for it over the next 6 months (actual returns average about 0.3x the site's potential return estimates).In the event it's wrong, let's look at a couple of ways you can limit your risk while staying long.Let's assume you're long 1,000 shares of SQ and are unwilling to risk a decline of more than 19% over the next several months. Here are two ways of hedging it (screen captures below are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app).Uncapped Upside, Positive CostAs of Tuesday's close, these were the optimal puts to hedge 1,000 shares of SQ against a >19% decline by late December.As you can see above, the cost here was $3,750, or 5.93%, calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts.Capped Upside, Negative CostIf you were willing to cap your upside at 18%, this was the optimal collar to hedge against the same >19% decline over the same time frame.You'll notice two things different about this hedge. The first is that, after an iterative process taking into account its net cost, the hedging algorithm was able to find a less expensive put strike, one that lowered the cost of the put leg to $2,250 or 3.55% of position value (calculated conservatively again, using the ask price of the puts). The second is that cost was more than offset by the income of $3,950 or 6.25% of position value, generated from selling the call leg (calculated conservatively, at the bid).So the net cost was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $1,700 when opening this hedge, assuming you placed both trades at the worst ends of their respective spreads.If you've owned Square since the beginning of the year, you're already up big. Getting paid to limit your downside risk in the event it pulls back is worth considering. Alternatively, if you're a Bulletproof Investing subscriber, you could consider buying and hedging the current top 10 names."
4170603,67855,2018-05-07T07:33:14-04:00,"Square's rapid growth continued in Q1.GAAP revenue growth was helped by the introduction of Bitcoin transactions.Adjusted revenue grew 51%, so the core business is doing well regardless of Bitcoin.Strength in the services business will enable Square to increase customer retention.Valuation is a big concern for the stock. Square is not on sale yet.","Square (SQ) printed decent Q1 numbers last week. Headline revenue and EPS both came in above analyst estimates and guidance was positive as well. Even though the company delivered on growth, with adjusted revenue up 51% year over year, I still have no appetite for the stock.I am not overly bearish however. For a high growth stock like Square, it often just takes one bad earnings for investors to temper their expectations, followed by multiple compression (i.e. lower prices). Unfortunately for bears, I don’t see any meat that they can sink their teeth into in Q1.Square’s growth engine is firing on all cylinders. GAAP revenue rose 45% year over year from $462 million to $669 million, accelerating from Q4 2017’s growth of 36%. A major contributor was Bitcoin, which generated $34 million of sales in the quarter, or 739 bps of growth. If we exclude Bitcoin from revenue growth, Square still grew 37%, showing no sign of deceleration in its core business.Adjusted revenue, a metrics that subtracts transaction based costs and Bitcoin costs (i.e. what the company bought it for) from GAAP revenue, showed a much stronger growth rate of 51%. While this Non-GAAP metric looks like one of those accounting tricks that the management uses to confuse investors, I actually think it is a reasonable gauge of the business. By subtracting extrinsic costs, investors can see a clearer picture of the company’s “core” revenue growth. Imagine if there is interchange fee increase that the company is passing on to its customers, GAAP revenue will see a jump, but adjusted revenue will not; this would be an accurate depiction of the business trend.The payment processing revenue saw gross payment volume increase 31% year over year to $17.8 billion. Note that this lags the adjusted revenue and GAAP revenue growth. The big reason is that services revenue increased by a whopping 97% from $49 million to $97 million, a slight acceleration from Q4 2017’s 96%. Given that payment is a highly competitive business, generating more revenue from the more differentiated services business is a positive development. The services business also feeds nicely into the payment business, as services could be seen as a way to retain existing customers by making them more invested in the Square ecosystem. Some services that make Square more “sticky” include payroll management and customer engagement tools.The business is great, but the valuation is not. The company trades at an astounding 14.6x current year’s adjusted revenue estimate.Much of the price appreciation came from multiple expansion, meaning that the company has gotten progressively more expensive. Contrast this with Visa (V):We can see that there hasn’t much change in Visa’s valuation multiple (here we are using P/E since Visa is profitable), but the stock price has risen nevertheless. This means that the stock has not gotten more expensive, instead the stock price is getting rewarded purely as the result of better fundamentals (i.e. higher earnings).No matter how good the business is, if you pay too much, you are going to get a bad return. I certainly do see a lot of potential for Square, but I believe that the current valuation is too rich. There is a limit to valuation expansion, because fundamentals ultimately catch up. A stock can’t triple its price-to-sales multiple every year. That being said, there has always been rumors of Square getting acquired, so perhaps the market is pricing in a premium based on that possibility. Should the rumor intensify, perhaps we will experience another jump.I see no major red flags in first quarter results. If I were a bear, I wouldn’t be too happy as the business is firing on all cylinders as demonstrated by high adjusted revenue growth and services revenue growth.Valuation is still a big question mark for me. Much of the stock’s run can be attributed to multiple expansion. While nothing is out of the question, it is highly unlikely that we will experience multiple expansion of a similar magnitude in the future. Speculators can take a gamble on a takeover, but that is the extent of my bullishness on the stock."
4181481,102797,2018-06-13T15:01:36-04:00,"Square has been in the spotlight following the surge in its share price over the last 6 months, and uncertainty now surrounds the space still left for appreciation.The company has a compelling strategy, a long runway for growth and strong stickiness to its offerings; hinting at much potential yet to be realized.Shares are about fully valued when a conservative approach is taken. However, the wider range of possible prices on the upside presents a favourable risk-return tradeoff.","Investing wisdom and academic studies alike caution one against chasing the high beta, glamour stocks. From the tulip mania of the 17th century to the cryptocurrency craze earlier this year, examples abound of markets that tanked following periods of exuberance; with investors who are late-comers to the party taking the hardest of the brunt. While not an extreme example, Square (SQ) is arguably a glamour stock; with widespread coverage following the 78% surge in its share price year to date, a high beta and its association with the buzzwords of fintech, payment processing. Yet, these alone are not reasons to stay away. A contrarian writing this off would still be herding, though with a different crowd and facing a different pitfall. In this piece, I study Square’s business and place a value independent of the recent noise on it.For a few years now, the increased adoption of contactless payment-enabled devices such as wearables, wallets and cards have seen electronic and mobile commerce volume grow at double-digit rates. This is expected to continue at a CAGR of 32% globally through 2022. While the shift towards an increasingly cash-free economy seems inexorable, the rate of its advent does not accrue equally across all sizes of enterprise. The economics of retail at the small and medium business level, with thinner margins and lower volume, are incompatible with the overheads and the fees associated with processing these. Payment structures are also often complex while registration processes are cumbersome.Square has been able to address this segment of the market by allowing retailers to convert their smartphones into card accepting devices, making the registration process efficient and their pricing simple. Above easing the onboarding payment experience, studies found that retailer acceptance are likely to be enhanced by ancillary services that support their businesses. A finding congruent with the gamut of services that Square is providing alongside their core offering. In addition to complementary analytics, the company provides inventory management, payroll services and credit lines, among others, that can enable retailers to manage and grow their businesses.Of eminence are its customer relations and omnichannel enhancements. Customer engagement and mobile loyalty, able to transcend the traditional pitfalls of loyalty programs, have been attributed as key drivers that would see mobile payments hit $503 billion by 2020. Omni-channel retailing is also pivotal, with emerging consumer behaviour trends pointing to annual web-influenced store sales of $1.4 trillion and opportunity costs at 10% of revenue for non-adopters. Square’s customer engagement solutions and recent acquisition of Weebly positions it to provide strong value amidst these trends, indirectly contributing to its own customer equity.Square’s Cash App is to consumers what Payments is to SMEs; in some aspects. While Payments caters to the cashless transaction needs of businesses, Cash App allows consumers to engage in P2P transfers and consumer-to-business payments. What the former has in a suite of services built around it, the latter has in Cash Card, Bitcoin services and Cash boost. These value added services have the effect of supplementing and entrenching the popularity of the core. With 7 million active users and counting, Cash App is also growing at a rate faster than PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and has recently surpassed Venmo in popularity on the app store. Overall, Cash App is in a nascent stage but displays much potential in its high adoption rate, pending evolution of its Bitcoin services, and the possibilities for consumer loans and synergy with its other businesses.(Source:Created by Author)David Robertson, in his book The Power of Little Ideas, expounded a low risk, high reward approach to innovation that bears a striking resemblance to the approach of Square. The Senior Lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management argued for a strategy distinct from the binary options of incremental innovation or disruption. That is, to create a family of innovations around a single promise. Lego and Apple turned around fading fortunes and exceeded past successes by doing the same around their key offerings - at one stage - of the Bionicle and iMac.Square exhibits a similar approach with their services built around payment processing for businesses and individuals. Even recent acquisitions of Zesty and Weebly serve to enhance their core offering by providing synergy and entrenching its value to customers. It is also striking how attuned to customers’ need Square has been. To provide flexibility, it has built an open platform that integrates with 3rd party solutions that customers may use. It also organized services around SMEs, with Square Appointment, Square Retail and Square Restaurants. These allow for the delivery of its family of innovations in a simple and targeted dose. Besides increasing recurring revenue streams, these create a high level of stickiness to its ecosystem of services.A good business frequently has a product or service that sells increasingly well with years. A better business has customers returning with recurring revenue. The best acquires these customers at reasonable costs and continually rakes in sales in multiples of that. Square, to some degree, has characteristics belonging to the last.Products & Services(Source: Square's Investor Presentation)While Square began with payment processing services, it has added a slew of promising offerings alongside that over the years. Besides attracting more merchants onboard, these new offerings are contributing a greater proportion of revenue with each year. That, even as the payment volume processed through its core offering is sizeable and growing at a double-digit rate. There is no question of the demand of Square’s services.Recurring Revenue(Source: Square's Investor Presentation)Of interest to an investor aside from the margins on those volume would be their potential for recurrence. A metric often used to gauge stickiness is Revenue Retention. It measures the ratio of dollar amount (not necessarily the number of customers) recurring from each period of operations. While anything not diminishing is desirable, Square has customers from each cohort spending more in subsequent periods and this appears to be persisting. A high retention rate translates to stronger growth and margins in the long run as it typically cost multiple times of retention to acquire new ones. The corollary is a stable and sustainable source of funds for reinvestment and eventual profitsCost Coverage(Source: Square's Investor Presentation)While a high lifetime value of customers is sought after, it can be negated by a disproportionate cost in their acquisition alongside the other operating expenses incurred. In this regard, the economics appear to be desirable for Square, with each cohort breaking even with associated sales and marketing expense within 3-4 quarters. Recurring revenue contributes fully to improved margins thereafter while fixed cost per customer falls as revenue grow in the double digit. However, it is noteworthy that sales and marketing expenses are but approximately 30% of operating expenses.Narratives and disparate figures should not cause one to buy stocks. Especially when they seem obvious and compelling. An overpriced stock requires even wilder expectations for multiples driven growth. That, while any blip in earnings could see sharp slides and losses. In the best case, a long time could elapse before the shares grow into its valuation, causing one to miss out on better options to deploy his capital.Operating IncomeIn valuing Square, I first stitched together the TTM financial statements to derive the most up to date records for a rapidly growing company. I then adjusted operating income to derive a stable figure for cash flow projection. First, operating leases are capitalized and adjusted for. These expenses are contractually established in terms of outflow and frequencies and they provide for tax deductions while being independent of operations. They represent a commitment quite like that of debt and ought to be treated as such in cash flow projection since it affects perceived leverage, growth and value. Also, I capitalized Product Development costs and amortized them over the typical period of 3 years for software to reflect the economic benefits that would extend beyond the current period.(Source: Created by Author using 10-K and 10-Qs)ReinvestmentsWith reinvestments, I derived the TTM accounts and adjusted them for the capitalization of operating leases and product development. This nullifies any cash flow impact, but retains the bearing on their individual projection. I included normalized acquisition costs in its calculation which are really external reinvestments.(Source: Created by Author using 10K and 10Qs)Free Cash FlowRevenueThe CAGR of mobile POS system in the US is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31.6% till 2020. Square’s GPV growth in the last 2 years averages at 32% (Investor Presentation), tracking the national rate. In projecting revenue, I assume a similar growth rate for Square Inc. till 2020. This is likely a conservative estimate as Square’s competitive position could see it grow faster than the national rate by taking a larger piece of the market. The acquisition of Weebly, alongside Square’s presence in various countries could also see it gain traction internationally. I retained the transaction-based revenue of 2.93% as it has proven to be stable over the last 4 years.Other revenue is approximately at 16% of the total in the last 4 quarters. This is generated primarily from subscription and services provided. I assume a linear rate of increase with a cap of 25%. Caviar, its catering and delivery segment, is in a saturated space while services could see budding competition from PayPal or even Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). It is also unlikely for these revenues to grow at a rate similar to that seen in transaction volumes as the latter is a result of trends on wider scales.Operating Margin & ReinvestmentsOperating margin is estimated to eventually be comparable to PayPal’s at 22.5%, with adjustments made to reflect the higher margins from subscription and services. A constant sale to capital ratio is used to estimate future reinvestments on forecasted revenue. A small increment is made to the TTM ratio to reflect scale that would arise from brand awareness above that from capital expenditure.(Source: Created by Author using 10-K and 10-Qs)Intrinsic ValueCAPM is used to estimate the cost of equity.

4169842,22148,2018-05-04T12:19:56-04:00,"Square trades weak following blowout Q1 numbers.The company remains phenomenal due impressive innovation and product line expansions.The stock valuation remains stretched as some expenses expanded faster than revenues.Using the diluted share count, Square trades at 17x sales estimates.","Anybody following my articles on Square (SQ) since the company went public back in late 2015 knows that my view on the stock switched from extremely bullish to very bearish. The recent weakness will pass based on the blowout Q1 numbers, but the stock needs to get cheaper first. Source: Square website The discussion on the company is relatively simple. Square continues to innovate, expand product offerings and grow revenues at an exceptional clip. Not much to not like about the company. The mobile payments processor was able to grow adjusted revenues by 51% in Q1. The company did the unthinkable of expanding revenues even faster than the 47% rate in Q4. Source: Square Q1'18 shareholder letterThe guidance for Q2 predicts 49% growth in the quarter. With a another typical beat of $10 million or more, Square will easily exceed the 51% growth of Q1. The market loves accelerating growth. The shift to larger sellers in the $500K GPV size makes it easier for Square to expand revenues. The company doesn't need to add many large customers to boost $18 billion in quarterly GPV. The big reason for the accelerating growth is the ancillary business lines of Instant Deposit, Caviar, and Square Capital. Subscription revenues nearly doubled YoY, but unfortunately Square didn't break out any of the specifics in this category except to exclude Bitcoin from the discussion as a boost to the business.Bitcoin boosted adjusted revenues by a meager $200,000 and likely cost far more to implement. Source: Square Q1'18 shareholder letterThe discussion on the stock is much more complex than the company. The valuation above $50 was problematic. With a diluted share count of 462 million, Square had a market valuation of $23 billion. The share count jumped from only 427 million in Q4 so that remains a big part of the issue. As well, most financial websites list the valuation based on the non-diluted share count of below 400 million. The incredible negative on the stock is the stretched valuation. Square trades at 13.5x forward sales based on a share count of only 395 million. Using the fully diluted count, the stock trades at 17.0x forward sales. SQ PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsAnother negative with the stock is the lack of leverage with the massive growth. The EPS beat was a meager $0.01 despite blowing past adjusted revenues by $14 million or nearly 5%.One will notice that the adjusted EBITDA picture is vastly different than the adjusted revenue one towards the start of the article. Revenues are accelerating on a quarterly basis, but the EBITDA margins are not. In fact, margins declined from last year to only 12% of revenues. Source: Square Q1'18 shareholder letterSure, the company is investing in the future. Adding Bitcoin trading helps build the Cash App and on and on. The stock though can't continue trading at extreme P/S multiples without a corresponding improvement in margins. Square spent heavily in engineering and product development with expenses surging 52% and above revenue growth. A shareholder better be glad that revenues accelerated to 51% growth or the stock would be down more than 5% with this cost escalation. Even sales and marketing grew in excess of revenue due primarily to the Cash App.Neither areas are necessarily bad for building a business, but both are problematic for an expensive stock. Most companies can grow revenues by spending more. The key is the ability to leverage revenue growth into improving the bottom line. Square could've limited expense growth in these categories to 40% and generated significant leverage by dropping another 9% to the bottom line. Some of the expanding service revenues for Caviar and Bitcoin aren't proven to effectively build long-term value. Can Caviar successfully compete against GrubHub (GRUB) in food delivery and will consumers really sign up for Cash App in droves to trade Bitcoin when so many other options exist? Would a cryptocurrency collapse actually add risk to the business model and move Square away from payment transactions in a negative manner. Will buying Weebly actually work or make the business more complex?The key here is to not blindly believe the positive narratives. Some of these new business lines could actually back fire and detract from the growth in the future. Paying an extreme multiple for the stock adds further risks. A great cautionary note is that Square first approached $50 back in November. Anybody holding the stock over the last six months now sees a lower price despite the accelerating revenue growth to over 50%. The key investor takeaway is that the Square is so priced for perfection that even spectacular results aren't pushing the stock higher. This predictable weakness will pass, but only as the stretched valuation is reduced by continue growth or a reduced stock price. Avoid Square until one or both occur."
4171087,98236,2018-05-08T10:33:20-04:00,"Both Shopify and Square reported the results of their March ending quarter this past week.In both cases, the results were substantially above the consensus and guidance was increased substantially.In both cases, some of the negative buzz that had arisen based on the comments of a professional short seller were proved erroneous by various elements of positive operational performance.In both cases, shares did not experience a substantial increment despite the strong performance and the stronger outlook.In both cases, with the outlook stronger and the share price stable, valuations have become more attractive and can readily generate positive alpha for investors.","This past week was perhaps the apogee of the earnings season, at least in tech. So many companies, so little time. There has been a consistent theme in the plethora of earnings reports that have cascaded endlessly through the ether. Most companies are enjoying their best quarter in years with exceptional revenue growth, strong operating cash flow and rising earnings. The other side of that picture has been the lackluster response to earnings. Just because it's apropos to mention, it seems that Apple (OTC:APPL) shares are seeing a very muted response to its quarter, so much better than feared by so many, so vocally. (Not following Apple in detail, there are some who say the quarter was just good enough-but the quarter was certainly better than some of the negative whispers emanating from brokerages and elsewhere). Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) blowout quarter has been greeted, basically by a yawn. And Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares, despite the best quarter for that company in decades, are actually below where they 2 weeks ago.I don't think writing about the large-cap growth names above at this point is likely to enlighten most readers significantly. There are many articles-too many perhaps-on SA and elsewhere, a host of brokerage commentaries, TV interviews, YouTube presentations and chat board encomiums to enlighten anyone remotely interested in these companies. I could, I suppose write about market dynamics, and indeed in writing the article to follow, I do have to drag in some commentary about the market; stocks do not exist in a vacuum.I was struck a few days past by reading a piece on SA regarding Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). The author recounted many of the metrics that SHOP had achieved this recently past quarter but then concluded he wanted to buy the shares in the low $100 range. The author noted that SHOP's growth has been exemplary, and at its scale, is exceeding growth rates of any other IT vendor, but that wasn't enough. I do think the author missed a couple of salient trends, but then again, I am sure I will as well. But the issue that I found a bit more off-putting than analytical judgements had to do with the commentary that there were plenty of other investment equivalents that have a lower EV/S ratio. And so there are. And of course, the author reprised, at least in part, the issues about our president and his tantrums about Chinese imports, which are certainly a part of the business model for some SHOP customers-the so-called drop-ship paradigm.For some investors, it can be difficult to buy shares in highly valued IT vendors. There is a sign/advertisement that JetBlue Airlines (NASDAQ:JBLU) posts within many web pages and on the TV screens in seatbacks to the effect that no one ever likes to pay full price for an airline ticket. Not much quarrel with that. And, so far as it goes, most investors want to buy the next…well Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) or Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) or Arista (NYSE:ANET) or Shopify or Square (NYSE:SQ) before it becomes recognized as so-called ""growth aristocrat.""The problem with that philosophy is that an emerging growth story often fails at some point along the way. In the venture cap world, a batting average of 20% or 30% is OK because one of those successes can appreciate ten-fold or more, and that makes up for the misses and the also-rans. In the public equity markets, the only way that I know of to have one of those 10-baggers is to buy and hold and not to be fixated by valuation. OK, I do not always follow my own dictum and in another time or place I could share numerous names that I have bought and sold because they spiked higher, or their valuation was too high or…the reasons for disposing of highly valued, high growth names is endless.Over the years, and unlike the JetBlue passenger, I have come to believe that it is far better to pay full-price for my ticket on a growth equity, if that is what it costs, then attempt the feat of trying to find a growth company at some supposed discount that is ""almost as good."" It is worth repeating that time and time again in tech, market share matters and the company with the leading market share will wind up with a disproportionate share of the profits and likely a disproportionate share of the growth in a particular space. No one is going to accuse the valuation of SHOP of being modest. Depending on one's estimates, the shares are perhaps selling now at around 9X or 10X EV/S based on a realistic expectation of revenues most likely to be achieved in 2019. But what is better as an investment-SHOP shares selling at what appears to be a stretched valuation to some now, SHOP shares before the company was recognized as the category killer in its space or shares of a modest growth business such as PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) - just as an example.At the moment, I do not own shares in SHOP or in Square - simply put because I sold them too soon. But while I certainly look for bargains and opportunities, and take them where they exist, I would actually be reluctant to buy SHOP shares if they fell by another 15% to the low $100's range. The reasons for the shares depreciate to that extent would almost certainly be such that either overall stock market valuations were under pressure because of geo-political factors or because the SHOP story, so to speak, was being severely challenged by either competition, a change in the demand picture for the solutions SHOP offers or a failure of the company's business model. I like SHOP shares as they are today; down about 19% since they made an all-time high in March, but still up a healthy 50%+ over the past year.The quarter reported by Shopify this past week, was its 11th quarterly report since going public-and its 11th quarter of beat and raise. It suggests that investors should not put too much stock in what appears to be conservative guidance. This is also the first quarter that guidance was articulated by a new CFO, Amy Shapero. I think it is fair to assume, that Ms. Shapero was even more cautious than the prior CFO, Russ Jones in forecasting company results.A brief review of SHOP's results shows a growth re-acceleration, centered on what the company calls merchant solutions, which grew by 75% year on year. Much of this increase was driven by the company's revenues from ancillary services such as capital and shipping, but the company also achieved strong growth in processing fees on the gross merchandise value transacted through its platform.Subscription solutions revenue grew by 61%. Shop doesn't provide the details of its subscription solutions revenue mix every quarter, but on a qualitative basis, the company substantially increased additions to its base of Shopify Plus users.The company grew its gross profit margin from 57% to 58% despite some notable headwinds impacting that metric, as the company moves its infrastructure to AWS and maintains duplicate infrastructure for the next several quarters while accelerating depreciation on its current investment in company data centers. Over time, gross margins are likely to continue to grow as duplicative spending will abate and the company will continue to derive more of its revenue from high margin sources such as Capital and Shipping and the other services that can be acquired through the ecosystem.Last quarter, the company increased its operating expenses by 65% on a GAAP basis, slightly below its rate of revenue growth. Sales and marketing costs rose by 67% and general and administrative costs rose by 40%. The company is recruiting developers at a prodigious rate. GAAP research and development costs rose by 81%. As is typical these days, hiring lots of developers means that stock-based compensation will rise more than commensurately. In fact, stock-based compensation for research and development more than doubled and this enabled the non-GAAP research and development ratio to be contained to 17% of revenue.Many readers may wonder what creates a competitive moat for SHOP. Basically, the company's moat has been created by a rapid introduction of new products coupled with the company's ecosystem. Spending money on research and development is a competitive tool that this company has successfully utilized on countless occasions. This year, the company is focused on developing versions of the product in many languages, a tedious and expensive undertaking, but one which significantly expands the company's TAM.At this point, SHOP is not generating cash and while cash flow is likely to modestly exceed GAAP profits going forward, the difference is small. That said, the company has a cash balance of $1.6 billion at this point in the wake of its share sale in February. The CFO, in her script, said that she was ""a big believer in the strategic benefit of optionality. So we will ask you now to stay tuned on that front as the year progresses."" Presumably that means the company will use part of its cash balance to make acquisitions that extend the company's product offering. One reason to imagine that growth will significantly exceed the company's 50% expectation is the expectation that this company will be adding some inorganic growth to its revenue base.It is probably worth noting at this point, that the strong performance of Shopify Plus is going to have a material impact on financial results as the year progresses. While the number of new accounts last quarter was more or less consistent with prior net customer adds (although better than expected because of seasonality), Shopify Plus net adds showed a strong increase. The basic Shopify offering costs $29/month and that is the one chosen by the vast majority of merchants. Shopify Plus starts at $299/month and goes up from there. Shopify Enterprise starts at $2000/month. The financial implications of increasing Shopify Plus users are probably underappreciated at this point, and will have, I imagine, a noticeable impact on growth. Some new Plus customers that were closed in the quarter included UGG, Sportsac, HarperCollins, Colgate-Palmolive, Nestle, and PepsiCo/Lay's where users can customize the packaging of potato chips. The need to put one's face on a bag of potato chips is something that baffles the understanding of this writer-but as the saying goes, whatever. The point is that these kinds of customers spend tens of thousands of dollars each month. Overall, Monthly Recurring Revenue grew by 57% year on year to $32.5 million, and most of that increase was driven by Shopify Plus which now accounts for 22% of MRR up from 17% in the year earlier quarter. One of the reasons to be optimistic about this company exceeding guidance is the very strong MRR metric; MRR is now accounting for almost 40% of projected full year revenues.As many readers are doubtless aware, Shopify shares have been a focus of Andrew Left and his Citron Research. That company has suggested that Shop shares are overvalued and that it has a flawed business model. Citron has also attempted to link SHOP with the Facebook (FB) data scandal. Rather than reprise all of the scurrilous drivel and so-called research advanced by Citron at this point, I will focus on the issue of Shop and its drop ship customers-something that may be a legitimate concern of some. Shopify offers a service called Oberlo. Oberlo is a service which essentially allows entrepreneurs who want to start a Shopify store, to set it up and start importing product in less than 30 minutes. Presumably that 30-minute metric doesn't include this writer who is rarely successful in using elements of new wave technology.In any event, Oberlo has gotten lots of interest and lots of publicity and it is certainly a factor in Shopify achieving strong new customer statistics. But it is still tiny in terms of its revenue impact-far less than some have speculated, based on what the company's CEO said on its conference call. It is not the main thrust of the company and the company's success going forward is not going to be predicated on developing a new revenue source of customers paying $29/month so they can import Chinese printers.In addition to Oberlo, and perhaps as an adjunct to that service is something that is offered called ePacket. ePacket is a service that has made possible faster deliveries from countries like China, HK and Korea to US e-commerce sellers. It is definitely another factor in encouraging entrepreneurs to set up Shopify stores to import products from China. It is cheap, and easy and most of all offers a very quick way of importing products from that part of the world. But again, it is far too easy to create a straw man around ePacket and suggest that plans the Trump administration may have to limit its utility might affect SHOP. At the least, those concerns would seem to be a gross exaggeration of any likely impact from modifying the capabilities of ePacket on SHOP's current business. I am far more inclined to believe the input that the CEO of this company imparted on these subjects during its conference call than the innuendos and half-truths on offer by Andrew Left and some of his colleagues. While Oberlo and ePacket are certainly services that have added to the growth Shopify, they are not central elements in the company's business strategy and certainly not elements of undue risk in owning the shares.Are Shop shares overvalued? I don't think they are. I am not going to try to construct a detailed financial model with a DCF analysis as has been done by one author on this site. I simply do not have the detailed data to do so and I think models are no better than the variable they contain with minimum confidence. What I do believe, is that Shop is showing substantial operating leverage at scale, and that it continues to be a category killer. Clearly, this quarter's gross margin attainment in the wake of a strong headwinds from accelerated depreciation of existing data centers coupled with the use of both Amazon and on-premise infrastructure needs to be carefully considered. And the fact that SHOP has upped its development spending by 81%, far from being a negative should more logically be thought of as an expression of the company's opportunities which are increasing substantially. The potential leverage at scale is increasing rather than decreasing.There really are and have been many competitors in SHOP's space and that is true since I first wrote about the company and its prospects. Its attainments have been made in the midst of many competitive offerings. The other day, a viable competitor in this space, with several hundred thousand paying users, Weebly announced it was being acquired by Square. Is that going to have a material impact on SHOP? I doubt it. Square needed more of a multi-channel capability beyond selling to physical stores and remote payment points. The amount of overlap between Square and Shop has been small and it probably will remain small.So, the basic question in evaluating valuation is the potential growth of the company. It is almost certainly more than 50% for the next couple of years. I think a 2019 revenue estimate that tries to capture some of the growth opportunities of this company as well as the impact of likely acquisitions, based on the huge war chest the company has amassed for that activity, is probably around $1.6 billion. The company's enterprise value, after today's 8% share price appreciation is about $12.3 billion. So, I think the EV/S based on next year's revenues is about 7.7X. Yes, valuations of most tech names have shown some propensity to contract so far this year, and that may continue to be the case, depending on the track of interest rates or other potential risk elements. But I think the EV/S of this company, looking out just a year or so, is quite reasonable and suggests plenty of potential alpha. I think the shares should be bought by anyone constructing an optimal long-term growth portfolio.The stock market can be a demanding mistress. Sometimes a company reports a blow-out number, dramatically raises guidance and the shares still turn out to put in a negative or mediocre performance. And in a single sentence, that is about what happened to Square's shares in the wake of a very strong quarter. Square has defied the conventional wisdom regarding compressing growth rates as a business scales. This is actually the 4th quarter in a row in which its growth rate in adjusted revenue has accelerated. It reached 51% last quarter compared to 39% adjusted revenue growth in the 1st quarter of 2017 and beat prior net revenue expectations by about 5%. (Most analysts measure this company in terms of growth rate and profitability by looking at its adjusted revenue, as opposed to net revenue). The company increased its percentage growth forecast for Q2 from 39% to 49% and it increased its full year growth forecast from 34% to 44%. Somewhat incredibly, Andrew Left got wrong footed once again-his ignorance about so many of his targets is overwhelming and the attention he receives for sensationalist nonsense is perhaps an indication of the lack of current journalism standards.I had personally given up on writing about Square shares when some investors decided it was a bitcoin vehicle and bid up its price based on the price of crypto-currencies. Square, for better or for worse, is not a crypto-currency analog; its adjusted revenue contribution from bitcoin transactions was all of $200k last quarter and while that amount will grow significantly, it has little to do with the company's prospects and future growth rate.The principle reason to buy Square shares is based on the company's ability to re-accelerate growth at scale. To the extent that such performance resonates with investors, as it does with this writer, is the extent to which the company's shares are attractive. The company is enjoying growth re-acceleration because of the ancillary services, which actually grew 98% year on year (24% sequentially) last quarter. Square is attracting larger sellers and they come to Square not because it processes payments better-although it is certainly competitive in that regard-but because of the company's ecosystem. Adjusted revenue from the larger sellers grew by 60% last quarter. At this point, subscription and service-based revenue has reached $97 million and was 32% of adjusted revenues last quarter. Square is no longer really a specialized payment processor and while it GPV growth of 31% is not inconsequential, and it wouldn't have an ecosystem if it didn't process payments, the reason for its growth are the many offerings from its ecosystem. In addition, the company generated 60% growth in its hardware revenue which was 4.5% of adjusted revenues last quarter. At this point, Square is not making money on its POS hardware but it has been a tool with which it has been able to attract larger sellers, who, on average, consume a far greater proportion of high margin services compared to the average Square customer. Much of the growth in services revenue came from the instant deposit service, the Caviar food delivery service and Square Capital. I have reviewed these services at some length in prior articles. But it is probably worth reviewing again, an optimal use case for Square.I happen to have a sweet tooth and that has led me to patronize an artisan bakery in New York City called Mille Feuille. The bakery uses Square to process transactions in its two locations. But it has also used Square Capital to help it finance remodeling and to finance other capital expenditures. And it has used instant deposit to gain rapid access to funds. As it happens Mille-Feuille will be using the Seamless service for taking orders on-line and for deliveries-but it could use Square's on-line ordering and delivery service called Caviar. And it could use the Square payroll service as well. It does use Square for some primitive analytics and to deliver offers to some customers, but it could enlarge its consumption of Square software.I am amused at least at some level, that Mr. Left and his minions think investors do not understand Square and think it is a bitcoin play. It may be that some investors do not understand the entirety of the potential Square value proposition. It is far beyond taking bitcoins as a medium of payment and much more about helping physical sellers automate their back-office requirements. The reason that growth has been re-accelerating, even at scale, has to do with all of the capabilities that Square can offer beyond payment processing-and frankly it is still in the top of the first in terms of its potential exploitation of those opportunities. The fact that Square can offer sellers both instant deposit, and capital advances puts it in a different position when compared to other IT vendors offering a remote payment terminal. And its ecosystem of literally thousands of applications that users can access, is another part of the ability that Square has to distinguish itself from competitors.Square, as mentioned earlier in this article, has announced the acquisition of Weebly, to propel the company into the non-bricks and mortar component of e-commerce Square has partnered with Weebly for some time, but owning is a different level of engagement when compared to partnering. Many Square users will want to be able to create a web presence using a Square branded solution, and Weebly is a good way of providing that, and providing a multi-channel approach for Square sellers.Most recently Square's shares were impacted by some announcements regarding Amazon Pay. Needless to say, anything with the word Amazon leads investors to concerns about competitive encroachment. But again, Square is about far more than accepting remote payments at this point, and Amazon's strategy doesn't seem to be focused on developing a holistic service for small business merchants comparable to what they can get from Square.Essentially, Square increased its revenue estimate for this current year by about $100 million but did not increase its forecast for EBITDA. Initially, when Square reported its results and provided its forecast the shares were under pressure, as the net impact of how the guidance was provided lead to a reduction in the Q2 EPS estimate. It took a while on the following trading day for the shares to shake off their weakness, and even now, despite the strong beat on revenue coupled with a massive increase in the company's forecasted growth rate, the shares are where they were before the earnings release while the market has shown some buoyancy.Simply put, Square is taking the additional revenues it expects to generate, and which will no doubt come with very high incremental gross margins, and upping its bets on product development and sales and marketing. The company CFO, Sarah Friar suggested during this last conference call that the company has many strong, ROI positive investment opportunities. The focus of these opportunities is going to be the expansion of Square's omni-channel offerings, financial services and international. These opportunities are ones that are supposed to drive incremental growth in 2019 and beyond. The current growth rate estimate most recently published by First Call for 2019 is just 30.6%. I think it is far more likely that Square is going to be able to grow at a 40%+ rate next year, after growing in the 45%-50% range this year including a few hundred basis points of growth from the pending acquisition of Weebly.One of the more interesting questions during the conference call came from an analyst who wanted to know with the company's former projection of long-term 20%-25% growth, which really is a key determinant in valuation. While not answered explicitly, the CEO, Jack Dorsey, suggested that the company has developed a strategy and tactics that are going to have a material impact in terms of increasing the growth rate and the CFO talked about the contrast between 20%-25% and 44%. Basically, she said, ""read my lips,"" and this will probably turn out better than the Republican campaign slogan in 1988.It is more than a bit difficult to forecast a long-term growth rate for a set of solutions that have never before existed. What smaller businesses can do with Square today is not something that could be done using any available alternatives in the recent past. If nothing else, the availability of cash both instantly and through Square Capital has never been something that users could access. And Square, as well as SHOP, has made it substantially easier for entrepreneurs to set up a business that can focus on retail expertise as opposed to having to deal with all kinds of back-office and cash flow issues.In this quarter's letter to shareholders, Square calls out a business in the UK that had been unable to accept cards because of costs. Square's offerings allowed him to economically accept cards again, and it facilitated the sale of a set of Square hardware as well. It is those kind of use cases that will work wonders in terms of retaining this customer as a Square user into the foreseeable future. That is not the kind of demand growth that is easy to measure.At this point, I think Square revenues over the next 12 months are likely to reach around $1.6 billion and will probably reach above $2 billion in calendar 2019, compared to the prior First Call consensus estimate of $1.76 billion. The company currently has a market capitalization of $19.7 billion and an enterprise value of $19 billion. While that is an EV/S ratio of almost 12X on the next 12-month revenue estimate, this company has achieved some moderate level of non-GAAP profitability unlike many other newer IT vendors. And the company's torrid growth opportunity is reducing the EV/S ratio rapidly; I project that it is less than 10X for calendar year 2019.At this point, neither cash flow from operations or earnings has reached a level that might support the company's valuation, at least in the opinion of this writer. That said, however, the company is efficiently run and has managed general and administrative costs carefully, and the ROI of its newly funded investments is likely to be substantial.Square shares remain a bit controversial with First Call reporting recommendations that include 16 buys and 13 holds. I think that ratio provides investors with the opportunity to see additional banks raise their rating on these shares. Now that a certain amount of the bitcoin hype has dissipated in the wake of the latest quarterly report, I think that investors are gain poised to earn significant positive alpha going forward."

If you increase the granularity, you will see other states like Nevada and Montana going blue for short periods of time.We can see in this data the ascendancy of a payment platform and its relative success. If you don't know what makes it so attractive, here are a few key differences:Venmo still has a lead here, but I don't think it will last, and I can imagine more ways that Square can enforce a stickiness to Cash App. As a simple thought experiment, Square currently charges its business vendors a transaction fee of 2.75% (or 2.5% with the new Register). Suppose there hits a critical mass of Cash App users, Square could offer lower pricing when customers are using Cash App to pay. Square could bypass credit card fees completely as one of its apps (Cash App) pays another (The Square register), generating discounts for the businesses using Square (lower fees) and better margins for Square. In such a situation, credit card companies don't take their cut, Square could keep it instead.In such a way, Cash App may have more avenues to be monetized while producing a positive feedback loop for Square. With a thoughtful setup, Square could turn its business customer base into de facto Cash App evangelists.Square applied for an ILC (Industrial Loan Company) bank charter back in September 2017, and after considerable discussion with the ILC committee has decided to withdraw the application and re-file. If this is anything like other industries, this is usually a very positive sign as the application gets straightened out for a shoo-in. No ILC has been approved in FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams, who joined the agency in June, gave some encouraging words to such charters at a banking conference, suggesting that a re-filing will not take so long before Square has a verdict on the charter:(Quote from American Banker)What would Square do if approved? Several other companies have ILCs, such as Target and Morgan Stanley, General Motors, Harley Davidson, and so on. Most of these companies chartered in order to offer financing to their customers. Square already does this through Square Capital, offering loans that are repaid on every customer swipe. Square has already stated this will be expanded (and was indeed just expanded on July 24th through a partnership with eBay).After ILC approval, Target started issuing business credit cards to anyone (eligible) who wanted one. This was a poor fit: The median Target customer is rarely a business owner, never mind in need of a Target-branded credit card, and TGT ended up ditching this product a few years ago. But credit cards for businesses would be perfect for every single Square customer, since every Square customer by definition is running some kind of business.In this way Square can offer revolving loan products (credit cards) to all their customers, making money perhaps on interchange fees, but also just by generally extending the lines of credit far out from what's currently possible. (No need for approval for a Square Capital loan when a business needs to buy a new walk-in fridge, say.)I think we can expect business credit cards and other such revolving lines of credit to be the first products from Square's ILC, which should be lucrative. Since Square already has all the information on a business' revenue (Square is already running the transactions for that business), they should be in an excellent place to determine who is and is not a good fit for such financial products. In fact, Square should be able to determine loan risk much better than traditional banks, who have less comprehensive data on their customers. Square not only has great data on each loan customer, but also the entire market the business is in, and the city the business is in for that matter, if there are enough other Square sellers in the same market or city.Square acquired Weebly in April, and this upcoming earnings will give us an update on the integration. Websites and e-commerce are (in my opinion) Square's biggest weak points, especially contrasted with its competitor Shopify (SHOP), so I'm excited about the integration of this acquisition to better fill out Square's online offerings.Square also announced their foray into restaurant-specific systems this quarter with Square for Restaurants. As their own press release mentions, Square is the only company to own both the ordering platform and point of sale.If you read much about Square, including my own long bull analysis of SQ written back in March, you will know that Square isn't just a payment company, they are a company that is trying to do every single service a business needs. The transaction processing is just a gateway to a host of services: loans, payroll, invoices, ordering, and a host of other verticals that are overlooked outside the industry. Most Square customers know about these, and many use two or more of them, which makes Square incredibly sticky and customers unlikely to switch. What is perhaps astonishing is that most investors are still blind to just how many services Square has its hand in, and just how much of a moat this gives Square. (Because investors may not ""get it"" until they see results show up in revenue several quarters later, I think Square may still be very under-valued at present.)So Square for Restaurants is really another building block in the empire. Restaurants can already use Caviar (Square) for delivery instead of having to schedule their own drivers. They can use Zesty (Square) for catering. They may already be doing transaction processing and payroll through Square. Now they can run the tables with Square, too.Back to growth. If we look at the last three 10-Ks, Square's transaction revenue is climbing nicely, but it is the services revenue that is meteoric, with super high (and climbing!) margins. Those numbers quickly:(See Square's last 10-K here.)Square is the epitome of a growth company. Every service they add, every market need they address, ensures more customers and more sticky customers for years to come. PayPal, while quite the revenue generator, hasn't had a home-grown new success in ages, and the only memorable thing they've done in the last decade is acquire Braintree (and with it Venmo).Square is only about one-quarter of the market cap of PayPal, but it is rising faster, growing in more directions and with more home-grown success. I expect within a few years it will be butting up against PayPal's market cap. If you are looking for the most interesting growth companies to hold for five years or more, Square should be on your list."

Services have doubled as a % of SQ's total revenue in the last two years.The growing revenue and margin of Services may make for a nice surprise the next two to three quarters, and won't be under-stated for long.Square sees great opportunity here, and has applied for an ILC bank charter to further their Square Capital and Services goals.For the Point-of-Sale business, other companies, including Amazon, have tried and failed to compete.Cash App has been the #1 Finance App on iTunes this entire quarter.","Most of Square's revenue falls into two major categories: Transactions, money made on card swipes, and Subscription & Services, money from Square Capital Loans, Payroll, Appointments, Inventory, Delivery, and more. Businesses usually start with Square for the credit card transaction processing, but Square's number of services and the cross-selling of its services has greatly picked up in the last year.Hidden behind the total figures are some very encouraging numbers: Transaction-based revenue is strong and growing (+32% year over year), but Services revenue grew +95%. This is starting to have a considerable impact on Square's bottom line, while generating double the gross margin compared to transaction-based margins.In other words, the less obvious part of Square is growing way faster than the ""obvious"" card-swiping part, and this fast-growing part of Square is also printing money at 70% margins. In the words of CFO Sarah Friar, ""It's certainly nice to see a line that's growing 96% year-over-year when it's pounding out the amount of absolute dollars that you also see in the quarter.""Finding a small, yet rapidly growing line of business hidden within a company is the holy grail of value investing. I have only stumbled upon one other ""in the wild,"" with Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS back in 2011. AWS was listed in the ""Other"" revenue column on their 10-K, even though by that year, it was AMZN's #1 area of revenue growth. Today it prints money. We may be seeing something similar here with Square's Services: Fast growing, incredible margin.Square's point-of-sale transactions are a foot in the door, the cross-sold services that give small businesses a huge leg up are the under-sung hero of Square's financials. Square knows this of course, which is why Square applied for an ILC Bank Charter back in September:In the Point of Sale space, there's not a lot of meaningful competition. Data from March approximating popularity with app store reviews:SQ and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) recently dipped on potential news that Amazon mulled getting into the payments business. This is a half-credible fear, but it's worth remembering that Amazon has already directly competed with Square before, in the Point of Sale space, and lost.NY Times 2015: Amazon Shutting Down Its 'Register' Credit Card ProcessorAmazon's track record is mixed, and investors often forget the failures. In the point of sale space, Amazon is more likely to acquire Square than replace it. As long as Square holds the Point of Sale crown, they hold the door to all business services.In the p2p and phone app payment space, PayPal's Venmo still has a large popularity lead, but Square's Cash App has been the #1 downloaded app in the Finance category on iTunes for the entire quarter.Unlike Venmo, Cash App allows users to directly deposit paychecks into their account, and issues debit cards, so Square gets part of the interchange fee. This is a monetization advantage that Venmo does not have. Cash App sees a bump in activity every Friday (most common deposit payday) that is now plainly visible on Google Trends:Highlighting April 20th, Friday activity. Cash App bursts ahead of Venmo in popularity.It's unclear how profitable Cash App is, but users treating it like a bank bodes well for future growth expectations, and the debit card (and its interchange fees) give Cash App a leg up on Venmo in terms of value to the company and to consumers.With all this in mind, I think the coming quarters as Square approaches profitability will be the most exciting yet.For a more comprehensive take on Square's future positioning and financials, read: Square Assembles an Army of Services."

Weebly’s website builder serves as an onboarding front end into Square’s network of service offerings.Over the past 12 months, Square’s stock has nearly tripled in value as the firm has posted improving financial results, as the chart below indicates:(Source: Seeking Alpha)The Weebly acquisition is one of several deals that Square has made to further build out its offerings to small business owners looking to either streamline their operations or access more potential customers.I expect to see a steady stream of acquisitions to continue this buildout, with special emphasis on international expansion throughout English speaking countries and other regions with strong entrepreneurial activity."

4141013,90215,2018-01-29T15:04:58-05:00,"PayPal's acquisition of Square would make a lot of sense strategically.Square's share price appreciation means that it's an expensive target.PayPal can make the deal work by issuing equity and raising debt, but it will be EPS dilutive in all scenarios.A deal is likely to irk some investors and is therefore unlikely to happen at current valuations.","Fintech was one of the most impressive growth stories of 2017. Card payment incumbents Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) saw returns of ~40%. PayPal (PYPL) gained ~83% thanks to its double-digit growth in key areas, Venmo hype and a strengthening balance sheet. PayPal’s smaller competitor Square (SQ) saw the most explosive share price growth, gaining 151% in 2017. I think it’s fair to say that investors have finally bought into CEO Jack Dorsey’s vision and execution of digitizing offline retail (by very rough estimates, offline retail still represents 90-95% of worldwide commerce) and recognized tremendous growth that this opportunity could bring.PYPL data by YChartsSquare has been touted as a potential target for PayPal for some time now. There are some clear strategic motives for PayPal to pursue this acquisition, which we will look at below, but has Square become too expensive an acquisition for PayPal given that the company’s market cap has more than doubled over 12 months? This is exactly what this article will discuss, with a simple merger model presented below to answer some key questions about the acquisition, if it were to happen in the coming weeks.Strategic ConsiderationsBefore examining how Square might fit into PayPal financially, let’s examine how the companies compare strategically. The key takeaway is that aside from several overlaps (e.g. Square payment terminals and PayPal Here) the two companies seek to address different markets. PayPal seeks to address ecommerce merchants of all sizes – from simple internet start-up shops to large multinational corporations such as Uber, Netflix and Ryanair where payment via PayPal is possible. The core focus and the main source of profitability for PayPal, however, are medium- to large enterprises. Square, on the other hand, seeks to address small- to medium-sized businesses. In its 2017 Investor Day presentation, the company estimates that in the United States there are 21M such businesses which would approximately bring $3TN in TPV, which in turn should yield about $26BN in revenues. As of Q1’17, SQ achieved a penetration rate of less than 3% within this addressable market. This potential $3TN US TPV is more than seven times PayPal’s global TPV currently. Lastly, small and medium sized businesses are for the most part price takers and do not have the opportunity to negotiate lower take rates in return for volume and visibility as large companies can with PayPal. I admit that SMEs can also take their business to Stripe, iZettle, AdYen or another competitor, but the point prevails that SMEs are a more profitable segment of the digital payments market. If we take the crudest (and illustrative at best) estimate of take-rate possible (Revenue/TPV) for both companies during trailing 12 months, PayPal achieves a take-rate of 2.9%, while Square boasts 3.5%. In fact, Nomura’s recent equity research piece argues that Square’s take-rate/yield should remain stable as payment volume grows. This is, of course, a highly speculative point and I would still expect take rate deterioration for Square but I believe that the main point remains: achieving even a 25% penetration in the small- to medium-business space could increase PayPal’s scale exponentially as well as boost profitability.(Approximate TTM TPV, based on PYPL and SQ 10-Q filings)The acquisition would also significantly strengthen PayPal’s strategic position in the point of sale (POS) market, where PayPal Here competes with Square’s swipe readers and terminals. Currently, the U.S. pricing for the two services is almost identical: Square charges 2.75% for swipe/dip/tap transactions (PayPal Here charges 2.70%) and 3.15% + $0.15 per keyed-in transaction for both Square and PayPal Here. Consolidation of the two products (probably under the stronger Square brand) can bring about some synergies and provide another way for PayPal to promote Venmo.(Source: Square Investor Day 2017 Presentation)Similar arguments can be made for Square’s ecommerce and business management tools which can be consolidated into PayPal’s. Some areas such as Caviar are more tenuous and may have to be sold.PayPal will also be able to scale Square internationally. Currently, Square is only available in the major Anglophonic nations plus Japan. PayPal has a strong presence in EMEA and a more modest one in APAC. PayPal has a European banking license with a banking structure in Luxembourg. This is a valuable asset with which PayPal can launch Square at scale in all EU countries and offer an extended range of services. With the global economy growing at a steady clip, diversification into Europe and Asia appears to be a logical next step.Speaking financially, an acquisition of Square helps PayPal kill two birds with one stone – it will eliminate an emerging strong competitor and it bring further growth to the company in areas where PayPal would like to be more present. It’s true that PayPal has healthy growth upwards of 20%, but Square is growing north of 30% and is much more focused on the SME space as discussed above. This comprehensive presence across large and small businesses would help to achieve Dan Schulman’s fuzzy vision of having customers use PayPal at least once a day.Merger ModelLet’s talk numbers. How big of a premium will Square’s board want for them to recommend the deal to their shareholders? Which premium will keep activist investors such as Elliott Management at bay? Can PayPal afford Square + premium given SQ’s steep share price growth? If so, how can it finance such a merger? What synergies can be expected from this merger? Well, the truth is that I don’t know. But by analysing various scenarios and building some sensitivity tables we will be able to see what premium PayPal can afford to pay, how much equity it can issue and how much debt it can raise. We will see EPS accretion/dilution for each scenario and determine the level of synergies needed for the deal to be at least EPS neutral. Given how expensive Square is using traditional multiples, we can reasonably say that the rationale for acquiring the target will have to be more of a strategic one rather than a financial.I’m conscious of the fact that I’m writing this article just a couple of weeks before we will have FY2017 numbers available. PayPal could well have some material update on how tax cuts affect the company’s balance sheet but this analysis uses the Q3 balance sheet figures which are the latest available. Think of it as a conservative scenario, since tax cuts may well improve the picture there. For income statement items, I’m using mean analyst projections taken from Thomson Reuters Eikon, which again, should be quite accurate for FY2017 and reasonable estimates for profitability going forward.PayPal has about $4.9B of cash and short-term investments and no debt. Its market cap is $102.6B and its Enterprise Value is $97.7B. Square is currently worth $18.5B (and an EV of $18B). PayPal trades at 2018 EV/EBITDA of ~24x, while SQ trades at ~72x. Square is indeed expensive by any traditional metric.For the base case I will assume a 25% share price premium with a 50% stock consideration. I will also assume zero synergies. This base case is a stab in the air regarding financing and valuation, but since we are running sensitivity tables it doesn’t matter how accurate it is once it’s in the general ballpark. In all scenarios, I’m making an assumption that PayPal can pay $3B in cash from its balance sheet. This will leave PayPal’s cash and short term investment balance at almost $2B, which I think is a reasonable amount to continue its existing operations. I’m also assuming 1.5% of advisory fees on top of the acquisition enterprise value of the target.In the base case, Square’s equity purchase price is $23.2B. Adding $341M of advisory fees on top we have a total use of funds of $23.6B. $3B will be paid from existing cash. With a 50% stock consideration, PayPal equity issuance will raise another $11.6B, and finally $9B of debt will be raised to cover the rest. At current income statement projections from analysts, the combined entity will be 12% dilutive to EPS in 2018 and 6% dilutive in 2019. The pro-forma entity will also have a Net Debt/EBITDA of 2.3x and EBIT/Interest Expense of 6.7x. Current PayPal shareholders will have 89.8% ownership in the combined entity. You will need $330M of synergies in 2018 for the deal to break even and $230M in 2019.(Source: own model)Many will find my base case assumptions unrealistic, so it’s more useful to look at sensitivity tables based on these parameters.(Source: own model)Looking at the EPS Accretion/Dilution Analysis we can see that assuming zero synergies, all variations of stock consideration and premium paid will give an EPS-dilutive deal in 2018 and 2019. However, dilution is less the more equity PayPal issues to finance the acquisition. This makes sense, considering PayPal’s stock has also appreciated 83% in 2017 and a further 16% YTD in 2018. This makes PayPal stock a powerful means of payment for the company and if there is a good time to finance deals using equity, then this year would be it for PYPL. Interestingly, even a 40% share price premium will deteriorate EPS by less than 20% this year.This brings us to the next important question: how much of net synergies will the deal have to generate to make up for this dilution?(Source: own model)My model indicates that anywhere between $200-460M in 2018 and $160-300M in 2019. This is almost certainly an unachievable task in 2018, provided that are synergies typically not realized in the year of the acquisition. Comparing this with Square’s projected EBIT of $207M in 2018 and $356M in 2019, PayPal would certainly be hard pressed to find these cost savings and cross selling opportunities. We can clearly see that PayPal will not be able to use synergies alone as a justification for this acquisition.Finally, let’s have a top-level look at credit analysis, since PayPal will probably have to issue debt to bring this deal over the line. Here, there are certain limitations to PayPal’s debt capacity despite their current debt-free balance sheet.(Source: own model)PayPal will probably not have an investment grade if its Net Debt/EBITDA is higher than 4x, so I’ve used this as a cut-off point for leverage. Similarly, credit rating agencies will be reluctant the rate PYPL higher than BB+ if their EBIT/Net Interest Expense are lower than 7x. In this model, this restricts PayPal to finance more than half of the acquisition using equity. The base case of 25% premium and 50% stock is below the waterline for the EBIT/Net Interest expense requirement. It’s not a good idea for a tech company to lever up this much at the top of the cycle, so this reinforces the point that PYPL must issue equity to finance the deal.ConclusionThere are some obvious strategic reasons for PayPal to buy Square, as I’ve outlined above. Unfortunately, the company should have been acquired one year ago, when its valuation was a lot more reasonable. At current levels, the only realistic way for PayPal to finance the acquisition is by issuing the bulk of the ticket price in equity and levering up to fund the remainder and live with significant EPS dilution. Despite being in my opinion a great fit for PayPal, there is admittedly limited scope for synergies in this deal when compared to the target’s EBIT and how much would be needed to make the deal EPS accretive. I believe that this deal still makes a lot of sense for PYPL, but it is a much more risky move now than it would have been one year ago. PayPal’s executives will face many difficult conversations with the board and investors about the strategic direction of the company should they pursue this acquisition. There are other takeover targets for PayPal on both sides of the ocean and Square may not be the best fit. But one thing is likely: competing with Square could turn out a lot costlier for PayPal in a few years time."

Aside from the odd audience limitation, Amazon's past failures suggest they might have an easier time making an acquisition here.","On the surface, the most popular P2P payment apps have similar appeal: Install app, connect a bank account, and start sending cash to anyone else with the same app. This makes everything from paying for yard sale items to splitting dinner a little easier.As I detailed here, PayPal's (PYPL) Venmo has a large lead in this space, but Square's (SQ) Cash App has some big functionality advantages. With Cash App, every user can get a debit card, and therefore, essentially a bank account, including the ability to receive direct deposit from their jobs and use the debit card at ATMs. This differentiation seems to be enough to drive heavy adoption in areas of the US that are (in CEO Dorsey's words) under-banked. From here, we see Cash App growing in popularity.Have a look at the Google Trends maps for Cash App vs. Venmo, on the timelines of 12 months, 30 days, and the last 7 days.Not only is Square's Cash App growing in popularity but their avenues for monetization are larger. The ability to get a debit card hugely increases the value to the under-banked, and it also makes generating revenue much easier for Square. The Visa debit card means that every debit transaction made with the Cash App card gives Square a cut of the merchant fee.As a minor note with little to show for it yet, Cash App is now available in the UK. (Venmo is still US only). We might expect Cash App to expand next into the other markets Square already serves: Canada, Japan, and Australia.If you're following AMZN, SQ, or PYPL, you've probably seen the headlines:Amazon's Next Mission: Using Alexa to Help You Pay FriendsFirm looks to make voice commands the next wave of commerceAt first blush this plan bakes in an obvious demographic disadvantage: Owners of an Alexa are a much smaller population than owners of an Android or iPhone. Of course, you could download the 2.5 star Alexa app on iTunes, but the description suggests it only works if you own an Alexa speaker. Maybe that would change.On the other hand, if Amazon wants to try and enter a space, they certainly have the resources to do so. Many a stock has fallen because Amazon merely mulls a market.However, it's very important to remember that Amazon does this kind of thing all the time and most people just forget the times that it fails. Remember for instance the last time Amazon competed with Square?NY Times 2015: Amazon Shutting Down Its 'Register' Credit Card ProcessorNot every venture inside the monolith actually pans out. There's a similar story for Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) competition (with a similar Etsy stock price drop on announcement, actually). Remember it?WSJ 2015: Amazon Targets Etsy With 'Handmade' MarketplaceAmazon's handmade efforts didn't get very far.You can see when they are announced, and you can see that no one cared by Christmas.Amazon's ethos of ""Announce fast, Release fast, if it fails, oh well"" is intentional. From Bezos' point of view, this is actually a feature. In a shareholder letter in 2016, he called Amazon ""The best place in the world to fail."" He wants lots of teams working on lots of products, and if some of them don't pan out, that's OK. This has lead to a lot of successes, but also a number of small headaches for consumers who use products that are quickly discontinued and (charitably) forgotten.In this latest case, Amazon might have a better time trying to buy PayPal for Venmo or Square for Cash App but also to compete in the small-biz transaction field that Amazon tried and gave up on. It would be amusing if this details-thin announcement was calculated to hit PYPL or SQ's stock price for a cheaper acquisition. That's probably way too cheeky, but for a lot of markets, Amazon has had more success acquiring than building their own.Personally, I think it's somewhat unlikely that AMZN would acquire PYPL due to a clash of cultures when it comes to customer service. (Amazon's: Very good. PayPal's: Legendarily evil). This reputation may also be the reason PayPal has kept their own name off of their Venmo acquisition product until very recently.I think there is a very slight chance that AMZN would try to acquire SQ. It would allow them to really break into small-vendor retail where they have failed with homegrown solutions before, and give them instant access to a growing P2P transaction market. Everybody loves to speculate about such acquisitions though, so I wouldn't hold my breath.I've written my own bull analysis of Square before here, though I am obviously not only a fan of Square. All three companies show promise in their own way."
4159310,29361,2018-03-27T15:27:27-04:00,"Branding: Square stands out as a preferred brand in the cyclical, commodity industry of credit card payments.Bundling: allows Square to increase revenues with lower customer acquisition costs.Beyond payments: setting up an ecosystem and network increases its stickiness with customers.","Square (NASDAQ:SQ) is down 6% to $53 in a broad market sell-off of 3% on the looming trade war between the US and China. I own Square, having first bought it in the low thirties; I will be a buyer again between $45 and $47 and recommend it for long term investors for 5-7 years.Square stands out as a preferred vendor for credit card accepting merchants across several categories, for its wide reach and simple solutions. Square expanded the non-cash payment market by targeting micro merchants, such as food carts, barbershops, delis, individual service providers such as CPA's -- by providing simple and cheap solutions on mobile phones and tablets. Sections, which were earlier under-served by traditional, slower competitors.In the process, with a huge help of new technology, Square created a brand, which didn't exist in the commodity business of payment processing, where the only differentiator was price. How many of you have heard of First Data Corp's (NYSE:FDC) Clover, Chase Paymentech or Elavon, owned by Costco (NASDAQ:COST).The focus on smaller players allowed Square to expand the market and grow unfettered, a segment mostly reliant on cash - its last 4 year revenue CAGR was 35%. In contrast, First Data grew at 2.5%.Very importantly, Square also did away with a lot of the complicated fees and time consuming set up.Square's bundling strategy to provide other services such as lending, analytics and same day payments allow it to get more revenue from the same customer without the extra customer acquisition costs.In 2014, Square got 98% of its revenues from processing transactions, which shrunk to 87% in 2017. 11% of its revenues now come from higher margin subscription fees and other services. I expect this segment to increase to 21% by 2020.Square's loans to its credit card customers are significantly less risky than other lenders, because it takes recurring principle and interest repayments directly from credit card receipts. When you're in your customer's cash register, you have access to his cash before him! Additionally, with the huge technology and analytics advantage that Dorsey and his troops have, Square is a lot more nimble than others in monitoring risk.What I find compelling in spite of the nosebleed valuation of 66 times 2019 adjusted earnings, is the relentless pursuit of finding new ways to keep the customer in the Square network. Take for example, its peer to peer mobile payment app Cash, which has over 7Mn Monthly Active Users second only to PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo's over 10Mn. Cash could become a significant revenue base for Square in the future. Payments from customers or your paycheck can go directly in to the cash account, which can then be used for paying for services, online, mobile or via swiping a debit (cash) card. Who needs a bank, right?Square struck up two significant partnerships - Eventbrite and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP). Eventbrite lets Square add new customers by being embedded in its app and website. SAP allows it to add medium and large scale business, who can add a payment processor to their accounting/back office systems, saving them the hassle of finding and integrating another processing system.Another trend in Square's favor was the estimated growth of 10-15% in global non-cash transaction volume in 2017 and expected credit card transaction volume growth of 54% and debit card purchase volume growth of 33% by 2020. While it's a rising tide and lifting all boats, Square with 30% revenue growth clearly outperformed it in 2017. By my estimates of 28 to 30% revenue growth in the next 3 years, Square should easily continue to outgrow the industry.Even as Square positioned itself as a small business solution, it developed hardware to acquire larger customers, where a mobile app or IPAD would just not do. Consequently, large customers have now grown to 48% in 2017 from 33% in 2014, bringing in higher revenue per customer.I believe Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), could be a significant competitor; while they are a much smaller company, ($673Mn revenues in 2017), they grew at 73%. Shopify's main product is providing vendors access to online sales via partnerships with the likes of Amazon and facilitating all aspects of e-commerce transactions, including website design and back office processing. And yet, 54% of these revenues come from transaction processing, Like Square, Shopify is a champion bundler and a huge hit with the same target demographic as Square's.First Data, is also not sitting idle with two strategic acquisitions in 2017- Blue Pay and Card Connect. It's a much larger player with net revenues of $8.1Bn.PayPal, with Venmo is a huge competitor in the peer to peer space and is very strongly supported by Millennials. PayPal, being much larger, with 2017 revenues of $13Bn has grown significantly slower at 13% in the last three years. PayPal is a not strict apples to apples comparison, because it's used for both receiving payments as a processor and paying as a customer. PayPal has been extremely strong in Mobile with one touch. I see Square making inroads into that space with Cash, but I expect the fight to be intense.The banks are also fighting back with Zelle, and they have the incumbent's advantage, but will have an uphill battle reaching Millennials.Higher margin services are growing twice as fast as transaction processing and will comprise 21% of Square's revenues in 2020, based on my estimates.This should lead to overall gross margins improving to 41% in 2020 and net income of $ 276Mn in 2020 and an adjusted EPS of 1.18.Sure, it's expensive at 66 times forward earnings but with 58% and 48% adjusted EPS growth in 2019 and 2020, its worth buying on declines."
4155572,104269,2018-03-12T11:45:12-04:00,"Investors and consumers are familiar with Square as a card payment processor. This perception is out of date and does not reflect the present or growth potential.Square’s transaction processing is the gateway to Square’s loans, payroll, invoices, ordering, and a host of other service verticals that are overlooked outside the industry.Transaction-based revenue is strong and growing (+32% year-over-year), but services revenue is higher margin, and growth is meteoric at +95%. These may eclipse transaction profits over time.Square Cash has stiff competition from PayPal's Venmo, but performs banking functions Venmo does not (direct deposit and debit card), and is currently more popular in app stores.The mis-perception in point 1 will not last forever, and presents an overlooked buying opportunity. Square may be very undervalued.","Processing credit card transactions was just the beginning. Square (NYSE:SQ) is gearing up two huge ecosystems around profitable business services and banking the under-banked.Before we break down Square's offerings, let's take a very quick look at Square's Point of Sale popularity versus the competition:Square is clearly winning the PoS war. (Toast, founded in 2012, could either be considered up-and-coming or aptly-named.)Distancing themselves from their PoS rivals might make Square a better bet than Shopify (SHOP) or PayPal (PYPL), but it doesn't explain why Square itself is undervalued. Read on.In addition to Point of Sale transaction processing, Square now does:Most of these are essential components of a modern business. Several big companies roll their own, spending hundreds of millions in the process. Everyone else stitches together hardware, software, payments, loans and payroll services from different vendors. If these services cannot easily be done, many smaller companies simply go without.Square now achieves major differentiation by selling not just point of sale, but a host of business needs in what has traditionally been a highly fragmented and complex services environment. Many of these services represent significant margins with few costs to Square, and cross-selling is easy once a customer is on the platform. Square is no longer just a payment processor, but a business ecosystem company.Customers get big value from this closed loop, and Square gets big value in the cross-selling.Square Capital offers exclusive access to small business loans for Square customers. They can do this better than traditional business loans for three reasons:Together, this means Square can originate loans faster and with less risk than a bank offering business loans. Again, the closed loop presents a big advantage for both Square and their customers. Every single Square business is a potential customer any time they need extra cash to expand or experiment.Example loan offer from squareup.comLoans are sized from $500 to $100,000 with an average payback period of 9 months. For growing businesses, this presents a huge opportunity and another reason to pick Square. For Square, it's very high margins and minimal risk.Every point of sale customer is a potential customer for Square's other products, and Square's other products are an increasing share of their revenue. Here I have revenue, cost, and margin numbers for the last three years. Note how Subscription & Services went from 4.58% of revenue to 11.41%, while having almost double the gross margin versus transaction-based margins.Tabular data is my own work. Every number can be checked using their last 10-K.Not only is the Subscription and Services gross margin impressive, but the Subscription and Services costs consist ""primarily of Caviar-related costs"" (from their 10-K). The other services like payroll and loans practically print money, or in the words of CFO Sarah Friar, ""It's certainly nice to see a line that's growing 96% year-over-year when it's pounding out the amount of absolute dollars that you also see in the quarter.""So Square does transactions, and that's where the meat of their revenue comes from today, but services growth and services margins are not to be overlooked. It reminds me of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) back in 2011 when AWS was listed in the ""Other"" revenue column on their 10-K, even though by that year it was Amazon's #1 area of revenue growth. Anybody who read that 10-K and didn't buy AMZN was insane, and today of course AWS is a sea of pure profit for that company and in its own category.I think these easily cross-sold services that Square is putting out will be a similar money-printing machine for Square, and an easy decision for almost every one of their customers. Of course, Point of Sale transactions are still the very important foot in the door, and that's a foot Square is solidly ahead on in the US market.(Square's growth overseas probably deserves its own article, so I won't talk about that here. If you don't know: They are in the US, Canada (2012 and with Interac, 2017), Japan (2013), Australia (2016), and the UK (2017). They have announced the intention to expand to additional markets but have not named names.)Gross Payment Volume mix by seller size. Larger sellers are becoming more of Square's base. From the 10-K.Square is often considered a payment processor for small businesses, but is increasingly serving larger sellers. The perception that Square is just for small businesses may hurt the company in the near term as medium and large businesses don't yet consider switching, but it also represents an opportunity for investors looking for stocks that might be undervalued because of this mis-perception.(Besides, today's small businesses are tomorrow's large ones, and today's small businesses are using Square.)Square acquired the food delivery service Caviar in 2014 and has been building out the brand since. Food delivery is an extremely crowded market but we can tell Square is confident that this idea is worth exploring because they keep taking on acquisitions to support the model. They acquired the 32-year-old company Entrees On Trays, a Texan food delivery service, and OrderAhead, a pickup service, to expand reach and expand beyond just delivery. Unique Caviar-only options slightly increases the brand value. Square's pitch to new customers is similar to its other services:(And their pitch to customers: ""Find hot, single food in your area."")Square's addition of food pickup makes for an easy track to on-board Square's restaurant customers into the service. It is in the interests of most restaurants and cafes to offer mobile order-ahead options, and places too small to offer delivery can easily add the option with the service, since Caviar provides the drivers.I'm not pessimistic about Caviar, but I left it for last because I don't think we can expect significant growth from it in the near term, relative to all the other services. As I mentioned earlier, it is a significant source of cost for the services revenue section.First, ask yourself: What do you need to open a bank account for the first time? Is it easier than downloading an app, creating a custom signature, and getting your debit card in the mail? If it's harder than that, sorry banks, Cash App has already won the next generation of customers.Square's Cash App directly competes with PayPal’s Venmo (an acquisition), and illustrates a second ecosystem for Square.Venmo has long maintained a popularity edge over Cash App, which is reflected in the review numbers: Cash has 26,302 reviews versus Venmo’s 108,275 in Google Play store, or 30.7K reviews (Cash App) vs. 1.9M reviews (Venmo) in the Apple App Store. This reflects a considerable incumbent lead for Venmo over Cash App.However, app popularity numbers are starting to edge into Square’s favor, which suggests that Venmo’s incumbent advantage may be eroding. Right now, Square Cash wins in all app store rankings (As of March 10th):Venmo and Square both make money by charging a small fee for instant deposit, as well as charging businesses that accept them as payment options. However, Square has two new avenues for growth and revenue that Venmo does not.In April 2017, Square's Cash App launched Cash Card, a debit card you order and customize with your signature, which is linked to your Cash account. From that point on users can make payments anywhere a debit card is accepted, and like any card, Square gets a cut of the fee from the debit-accepting merchant.Venmo scrambled to beta test a similar debit card offering in September 2017, which was available to only a few people, derided as ugly (it was literally a picture of pizza dough, they promised the design wasn't meant for general release), and seems to have dropped off the radar since then. Cash App's card is almost upon its one-year anniversary.Then in March of this year, Cash App announced support for direct deposit of paychecks. This means Cash App now approximates a bank, with every user that wants one getting payday deposits, a routing number, account number, and debit card. There are no bank fees, and the setup is ATM capable. Square reaps the profits from users purchasing with their debit Cash Cards (through merchant vendor debit fees, not charging the users fees).Issuing account numbers and debit cards means Square's Cash App ecosystem is much more than just P2P payments, it is the easiest way for an under-banked person to bank. And this banking product is reaching a segment that traditional banks have had a hard time dealing with (and seem to actively shun, with account minimums and maintenance fees).According to Jack Dorsey, the Cash Card is reaching the under-banked audience successfully, with the two most popular uses of Cash Card being McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). And after them, Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), which suggests millennials are using it in big numbers too. Dorsey also called out usage among everyday services, like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).In other words, Square has re-invented the basics of banking, packaged into a simple app, with zero-friction onboarding. Every bank's dream is to get the new generation of people to sign up, and Cash App's simplicity has the opportunity to take the lion's share.This is a differentiation from Venmo that might lead to a total reversal in incumbency. Cash App not only has services Venmo does not, but more avenues to monetization. CFO Sarah Friar said, ""Over a third of all Cash App transactions are monetized"" through instant deposit, Cash App business, using a credit card, or now particularly through the (debit) Cash Card itself. Cash App does not have its own revenue line in Square's 10-K, but we can presume it is relatively profitable, and the debit card advantage suggests it has a much higher percent of monetized transaction than Venmo, since it has more avenues.Unfortunately, PayPal also does not give specifics on Venmo's profitability, they only state transaction volume (and in the 10-K, hardly mention Venmo). In January, CEO Schulman did say about Venmo: ""While we're still in the early stages of monetization, we're very encouraged by our initial leads on engagement.""I don't have an MBA, but I think that translates to ""It's not profitable, but look at the great user count.""Yes, you can buy and sell bitcoin with Square Cash. Friar noted it is ""really immaterial"" to Square's financials, and I suggest you take their word for it. If you want to invest in bitcoin, don't buy SQ, just download the Cash App and buy bitcoin.The impressions that Square is just a payment processor and just for small businesses are some of its biggest weaknesses, but it is a marketing problem and only a matter of time. If it is a weakness, then it is also a buying opportunity.There are payment processors, but no payment, payroll, loan, inventory and employee management systems except Square. I expect growth to be stronger, and the gains stickier, than any of Square's current competitors.There are peer-to-peer payment apps, but no competitor gives you a debit card that can be used anywhere including ATMs, and accepts your paycheck as funding. As I said above: What do you do to open a bank account for the first time? If it's harder than installing an app, Square's Cash App has already won the customer.Square is experiencing big growth and iterating fast on two fronts, and I think it's only a matter of time before we see the market value it to reflect its real potential."
4135432,102875,2018-01-04T20:04:05-05:00,"Since its IPO in 2015, Square’s stock has gone through periods of deep depreciation and exponential growth.At the moment, Square is financially inefficient, as its business model still has to prove that it’s relevant in the current market environment.We have opened a short position in Square and plan to hold it for a couple of months, as there is more downside than upside to its price.","Since its IPO in November 2015, Square (NYSE:SQ) has gone through two major periods. The first period was right after its public offering, when the company failed to attract serious investors in the first few months and as a result its stock has gone through a period of turbulence, when its share price has fallen to its all-time low.The second period started in mid 2016, after Square’s stock began to rebound from its lows and managed to almost triple its share price by November 2017. Such growth was managed mostly thanks to the improvement of the company’s earnings results, constant beat of analysts’ estimates and an overall growth of the market.Source: BloombergAs Square’s stock is having a pullback from its all-time high, we believe that the third period is forming right now, as its stock starts to correlate and the new earnings results won’t guarantee future growth.Below is the comparable analysis table that compares Square to its rivals from the overall finance sector. Since the company’s main business is financial services, even though its payment solutions could be considered innovative and slightly better than those of its competitors, we decided to put Square against other financial services enterprises to help us better understand how financially strong Square is among its industry’s peers. The table below also shows that all of the major Square metrics have negative multiples, its business is still unprofitable, even though the company is in operation since 2009, and its revenue is relatively small in comparison with its high enterprise value. In addition, Square loses money on the operational level, which leaves it with no opportunity to spend cash in the next stage of its business process. Because of that, we couldn’t really define multiples for its EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT metrics and we believe that the company is overvalued at the current market price and its stock is overbought.Source: Capital IQ, Own estimatesIn addition to that, another table below shows how efficient Square is from the operational standpoint against its peers. If you look closely at the numbers, you’ll see that the company has negative stats among an overwhelming majority of metrics, with gross margin being the only one metric that is in positive territory. While Square doesn’t have any debt, it has high shareholder capital, which leads to a higher weighted average cost of capital. Because of that and because of the poor efficiency, we have not been able to create a traditional DCF model, since the final fair value will have too great of a discount from the current market price.Source: Capital IQ, Own estimatesLooking at both of those tables and comparing all the numbers above, we believe that Square still hasn’t exited the startup stage, as its business model still has to prove that it’s financially efficient and relevant in the current market environment. With the capitalization of around $15 billion and revenue of a little more than a billion dollars in the last three quarters, Square doesn’t have any profit and it’s unlikely that it will have one in the foreseeable future, considering how weak it is financially. As there is no real fundamental backing behind the current market price, we believe that Square has every chance to decrease in value in coming months. We have opened a short position of the company’s stock on Thursday morning and plan to hold it for a couple of months, as there is more downside than upside to its price and it plays a small role in our overall short portfolio."
4143953,93446,2018-02-07T08:32:18-05:00,"Total addressable market may not be as high as the company suggests.However, Square has not reached its full growth potential.Square's revenue can double within the next five years.My target price is $72 translating to 60% upside.","Square, Inc. (SQ) should be reporting revenue in excess of $2 billion at the end of February, merely nine years after its founding. As impressive as those results are, what is perhaps more impressive is the amount of revenue that remains to be captured, and reaching an additional $2 billion in revenue could occur in half the time. The premise of my article is to determine if SQ is an appropriate investment at the current price while getting a better understanding of Square’s market size.To justify purchasing SQ at this price, I would like a risk/reward ratio of 1/2.5. Additionally, I would like to hold this stock for about five years and earn at least 15% per year. A 15% annual return equates to a price of $70.40 in 2022 and selling if the price drops to $20 within five years. Square has already satisfied my 2018 requirement and is quickly approaching my 2019 target (my price target is based on the 2017 closing price).(Source: My calculations)The next step in my analysis is to create an income statement, using assumptions that some analysts have cited in research reports with regards to growth, to see what $70.40 could look like against key ratios.There is a general notion that Square can grow revenue at about 35% for the foreseeable future. I use this growth rate as a starting point for my analysis. However, instead of using a 35% revenue growth target, I will use 35% Gross Payment Volume (GPV) growth, which drives transaction-based revenue. I created a five-year income statement with 35% GPV growth and assumed that transaction-based revenue, both domestic and international, will continue to be 3% of GPV. SQ has yet to report 2017 results, but I arrive at an estimate for year 0 based on company guidance and other assumptions.(Source: My calculations and Square results)According to my analysis, SQ should reach $9.6 billion in revenue by the end of 2022 and earn about $1.92 per share. I grow diluted shares at 1% annually. Additional assumptions are as follows:(Source: My calculation)International revenue as a percent of total revenue increases 1.5% annually for the next five years, which translates to roughly 60-70% annual growth. Domestic revenue grows over 30% annually. The revenue breakdown as it currently stands is about 96% domestic revenue and 4% international revenue, but that number changes to 88.5% domestic revenue and 11.5% international revenue by 2022. Growth for other sources of revenue stays flat. In terms of per share metrics, the following table shows what 35% growth could look like for the next five years.(Source: My calculations)If I use my five-year price target of $70.40, Square’s P/E would be about 37x 2022 earnings. Price-to-sales would decrease to a more reasonable level than what it is today. If Square is still growing at 35% in year 5, a 37x P/E ratio would probably be too low, and the target price should be higher. This certainly seems like a buy. However, there is one problem.According to page 4 of Square’s 10-K, specifically the second to the last sentence, SQ states that at the end of 2016, $49.7 billion GPV was generated by 1 billion card payments from approximately 245 million payment cards:(Source: Square's 2016 10-K)Based on the number of card payments and payment cards, there were four transactions per card in 2016. I do not make an assumption for stolen, retired, or replaced cards because my research shows that the business failure rate, especially for small businesses is roughly the same percentage as the card turnover. $49.7 billion on 1 billion card payments translates to an average transaction size of $50. A summary of 2016 card data and prior years is as follows:(Source: Square 10-K and my calculations)Since the company reports GPV on both domestic and international transactions combined, I used an assumption that domestic GPV, along with card payments and payment cards, equals the percentage of domestic revenue or, in this case, 96% for 2016 and 2017.There are two key metrics that prove worrisome. First, “implied transactions per card” growth is starting to decline, and second, “implied average transaction size” is also declining. Therefore, annual transaction size is growing slowly and much slower than revenue. This is problematic because in 2022, at 35% growth, domestic GPV will be about $264 billion, larger than my calculation of the domestic market size. Let me demonstrate how I arrive at my calculation.Using Census Bureau Data, a 2016 study by the Gallup Organization, and Square results, I calculate an “implied market size”. Let me be clear, this is not a static number and does not represent a total addressable market. As metrics change, so will the market size in my calculation. Data shows that roughly 76% of the U.S. population is over 18. According to a 2016 Gallup study, of the adult population, roughly 70% have credit cards. Of those adults with credit cards, there are roughly 3.7 cards per person, on average. I could not find reliable data with regards to debit cards, but I’m going to assume every person over 18 has at least one debit card. Some studies suggest 90% of adults have bank accounts, but I am okay with assuming every adult has a debit card. The table below estimates the potential market size assuming 1% annual population growth and 3% annual transaction size growth.(Source: Census Bureau, Gallup Study cited by Creditcardstatistics.com, my calculation)Unless Square starts increasing annual transaction sizes, the market potential is somewhat limited. Revisiting my income statement for 2022, the domestic GPV calculation was $264 billion.(Source: My calculation)At 35% growth and 3% annual improvement in per card metrics, Square’s domestic market share of the American population will be 120%. 35% growth is not achievable without improvement in transaction size, and even then, Square is not going to have every American, on average, using Square at least 4.7 times per year. However, let’s assume SQ can get at least 60% of Americans to use its technology, as opposed to 120%, and GPV remains the same. In other words, I’m trying to determine how much Square needs to increase transaction sizes to reach 60% penetration (as opposed to 120%). At 60% penetration, average transaction size would have to increase roughly 15% per year and reach $100 in five years, up from the $50 it has today, or average transactions per year would have to increase from 4.7 to 9.3 in five years (or a combination thereof).(Source: My calculations)In summary, 35% growth for the foreseeable future, without larger increases in transaction sizes, is not possible. Therefore, I am not necessarily buying the hyper-growth story.Before bears start jumping for joy, my analysis merely shows that 35% is unlikely with modest transaction size growth and not necessarily that Square is a bad investment. As a matter of fact, Square doesn’t necessarily need to grow at 35%, and achieving a per share price of $70 in five years is quite possible.In the latest investor presentation, Square claims that it is operating in a $3 trillion GPV opportunity. The company’s estimate is based on credit card payment volume multiplied by 50%. I personally think this is a gross overestimation, so I am going to come up with a different approach.(Source: Square 2017 Q3 Investor Presentation)The Small Business Administration publishes data with gross receipts for small- to medium-sized businesses, which are categorized as either an employer or non-employer business. Non-employer businesses have no payroll and generate over $1,000/yr. in receipts. Employer businesses have payroll and generate over $1,000/yr. in receipts. The data consists of 18,000 categories for employer businesses and 500 for non-employer businesses with an NAICS code assigned to each.The latest data set I found dates back to 2014 and is considered static (does not take into account business births/deaths). The table below summarizes the number of businesses and the total receipts.(Source: Small Business Administration Firm Data)To arrive at my summary, I use all non-employer businesses and employer businesses with less than 500 employees. I calculate a $12 trillion opportunity and not a $3 trillion opportunity. Of course, this is not entirely accurate because there are many sectors in the calculation that would not use a Square product for transactions; for example, those in manufacturing or wholesaling. Below is sample data of industries that are part of the table that is included in the calculation but should be removed.(Source: Small Business Administration Firm Data)I went through the 18,500 data points to remove those sectors that would not, in all likelihood, be a Square customer. Retail categories, restaurants, and recreational businesses (just to name a few) remained after the data was scrubbed. After filtering out all the sectors that would most likely not use Square products, I arrive at the following summary.(Source: Small Business Administration Firm Data)According to my calculations, the GPV opportunity is closer to $1 trillion. For argument’s sake, I’m going to say the GPV opportunity is between $1 trillion on the low side and $3 trillion (Square’s estimate) on the high side for the domestic market. Obviously, this is not 100% scientific, but the idea is to get a better estimate of revenue opportunity for my valuation. I use my 3% GPV calculation to arrive at gross revenue, which means my estimate of revenue potential is $31 billion not $26 billion, higher than SQ’s estimate. However, according to an Intuit study in 2013, only 45% of small businesses accept credit cards. A study by Community Merchants USA, in the same year, stated the number of businesses accepting POS transactions is closer to 66%. Because this is an older study, and of course, we are moving towards a cashless society, I’m going to assume 75% of all businesses accept credit cards. The revenue opportunity is now $23 billion, but there is another adjustment to be made. Businesses that accept credit cards will have some portion of transactions in cash. In my analysis, I assume 75% of company sales are credit (or debit)-based. A 2016 study found that roughly 32% of transactions are cash-based. I’m going to use a lower rate, 25%. Making all adjustments, I arrive at a $17 billion gross revenue opportunity. This is much lower than the $26 billion opportunity but still quite large. Adjusting my number by 5% growth from 2014 would give a number closer to $20 billion.(Source: My calculations)According to my calculations, SQ is capturing 6.1% of the domestic market (based on my analysis) or 10.8% after adjustments (described above). In five years, capturing 17% after adjustments is quite possible translating to a potential revenue target of $3.8 billion, 104% above estimated 2017 revenue.(Source: Square results and my calculations)Previously, I discussed a method to calculate market share based on population statistics and current transaction-size metrics. I want to revisit that model to see what a gross revenue opportunity could look like in five years, assuming similar assumptions. Revisiting my calculation, assuming 1% yearly population growth, no change in demographics, and a 3% yearly average transaction size growth, I arrive at a $221 GPV market size. By my calculations, Square is currently penetrating 35% of the adult population. I would be okay to assume this number can increase to 55% within five years.(Source: Census Bureau data and my calculations)From my population calculation, the revenue opportunity is about $3.6 billion, very close to my first calculation of $3.8 billion.Based on both of my models, domestic transaction revenue could realistically reach $3.7 billion within five years.Square claims that there is a $14 billion revenue opportunity on loans over $250,000. However, according to one graphic on the Square Capital section of the company’s website, loans are made up to $100,000. I am going to use loans under $100,000 for my analysis.(Source: Square 2017 Q3 Investor Presentation)According to the Small Business Administration, there was an estimated $151 billion in loans outstanding with origination amounts less than $100K. The top companies accounted for $108 billion of those loans. Sample data is presented below:(Source: Small Business Administration lending data)The top 100 banks are some of the largest institutions that cater to clients who can be offered a more favorable rate than Square Capital, which charges a flat fee but has an implied average rate of 15% on average. In all likelihood, the borrowers of Square loans are probably deemed “risky” by traditional lending institutions. The average SBA loan is about 7%, so my guess is that most consumers would not choose to pay double the rate for convenience. I am going to assume that the potential opportunity is roughly $42 billion in loans outstanding, which represents the arbitrarily defined riskier portion (riskier portion defined as loans not serviced by the top 100 companies). According to the 2017 Q3 conference call, currently, $58 million sat on Square's balance sheet as loans outstanding. This implies a .14% share of the “riskier” loan availability on loans outstanding. In 2017 Q3, Square Capital facilitated 47,000 business loans totaling $300 million ($1.2 billion run rate) or 3% market share based on loans made (either sold or outstanding as a percentage of loans outstanding).The revenue potential assuming Square can capture 20% market share is:(Source: Small Business Administration and my calculations)If SQ were to make 100% of the loans, $42 billion in loans not serviced by the top companies, it would only reach about $1 billion in revenue, not $14 billion, quite a difference. Again, my $42 billion opportunity is not static as some customers in the less risky pool might in fact choose Square for ease (or other reasons). For now, I’m going to use $1 billion for my revenue target.(Source: Small Business Administration and my calculations)Within five years, I believe Square can make over $2 billion in loans. Assuming a default rate of 2%, an average interest rate of 15% per year with a 4% cost of capital, I arrive at a revenue target of $286 million.I use two methods to estimate revenue potential for payroll services. For my first calculation, I revisit the SBA data of business receipts for employer and non-employer businesses. Using NACIS code 541214, Payroll Services, I arrive at the following calculation of revenue potential:(Source: Small Business Administration and my calculations)Achieving 5% of this revenue stream within five years is quite possible translating to $406 million in revenue. My second method derives from a National Small Business Association survey in 2017. According to the survey, small businesses spend an average of $500/month on payroll services. I use this number along with the number of small businesses that I calculated above (my $1 trillion calculation) of 1.26 million employer companies. I assume Square can capture at least 5% of those companies within five years.(Source: Small Business Administration and my calculations)This is potential revenue of $378 million. One thing to keep in mind is that I am only using payroll service numbers for small companies. This is a service that Square can provide to larger companies, which means revenue potential would be a lot higher.I am going to leave out other sources of revenue, specifically with regards to Caviar, Bitcoin, and hardware for the sake of simplicity as I see those as continuing to being a being a smaller part of revenue in five years. Nevertheless, I’m going to make an assumption with regards to revenue for those areas. The table below summarizes my revenue stream. Note: International transaction revenue and international market size are somewhat arbitrary, based on percentages of domestic revenue. I did not want to get into a discussion of international revenue because that deserves its own write-up. Let's just say there is a lot of revenue to capture, which I seriously underestimate.(Source: My calculations)I use two methods to calculate a target price, both based on average multiples for Square’s peers. My 5.5x price-to-sales ratio yields a $67-69 price while my EBITDA calculation yields $72-75. Revisiting my share price estimates, and using $72 as my exit point, I arrive at a 12.5% four-year return assuming today’s price is 2018’s closing price. My upside decreases to 60%, not as high as my initial 100%, unfortunately. Additionally, my risk/reward moves to roughly 1/1.8.(Source: My calculations)Revisiting my income statement, I arrive at the following numbers:(Source: My calculations)In five years, this company will be overvalued if using a 77x PE ratio, but I would be willing to accept this higher valuation as the company should still be growing.I omitted a discussion of price based on a discounted cash flow model. I have enough experience that I can guess a DCF model will show an intrinsic value of $35 or at least I can play with the terminal growth rate to achieve a desired result. However, I also know that shorts based on valuation rarely work out unless one can time the peak. My analysis shows that $2 billion in revenue is nowhere near its peak and even though Square may not grow at 35% for the next five years, I’m okay with taking on the risk because there is enough growth in other areas to compensate. Square’s revenue is not close to peaking with only an estimated 15% market share within five years, which is still reasonable and offers plenty of upside. My analysis does not even get into a good discussion of international revenue, which also holds plenty of upside. Thus, I am hoping to take a long position within the next 30 days and re-evaluate when the price reaches $70. I would not advocate allocating 100% of a portfolio towards SQ but feel very comfortable buying as part of an overall portfolio strategy. If transactions sizes continue to decrease, then I may consider selling, but right now, there are not enough catalysts that would convince me not to buy.Update: In light of recent market events, I am now long SQ at a purchase price of $40."
4151873,22148,2018-02-28T14:33:01-05:00,Square ended 2017 with revenue growth accelerating to 47% YoY.The company faces a negative trend in 2018.The Cash App generates limited actual transaction value.The stock remains grossly overvalued.,"As Square (SQ) investors look towards 2018 numbers, the company is fighting a trend that most don't even realize. A big clue was provided in the guidance that will make stock gains from a struggle after the big rally in 2017.The one trend that gets all growth stocks is decelerating revenue growth. The market pays up for growth stories like Square, but the stock losses pile up when the trend ends.In the case of Square, the company just ended an exceptional year. Adjusted revenues surged 47% in Q4 and ended a period where the growth rate accelerated each quarter during the year starting at only 39% in Q1.The biggest concern comes with sustaining those growth rates in 2018. The mobile payments provider guided to only 34% revenue growth for the year while Square forecasts starting at 44% in Q1. The trend will completely reverse what occurred in 2017 and cause the market to extrapolate where the trend ends.Source: Square Q4'17 shareholder letterThis problem wouldn't be a huge issue if it wasn't for the stretched P/S multiple. Square trades at about 14x the updated revenue estimates of $1.3 billion.SQ PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe one saving grace to longs is that Square absolutely crushed the original 2017 revenue estimate of possibly reaching $900 million. Adjusted revenues ended up at $984 million last year.The difference in the story is that Square guided to Q1 revenues growing 31% last year and 30% for the year. The company wasn't facing a big GPV headwind. At 31% growth in Q4, the vast majority of the revenue base is slowing towards only 30% growth.Source: Square Q4'17 shareholder letterAs predicted in my previous article, the Cash App isn't much help to revenues. The mobile payments provider now has 7 million active accounts, but the total December spend by customers was only $90 million. The average active account only spent $12.80 during the month or hardly enough for a dinner by even a thrifty diner.The bitcoin thesis isn't likely to play out to any meaningful revenues with big investors already having accounts at Coinbase or other providers. The Cash App generally appeals to the younger crowd.The business is all generally additive to the prospects of Square and adds to the scale of the company. Using this business line to build a case for owning the stock at a valuation of $19 billion (427 million diluted share count) is a far different story.The key investor takeaway is that investors are paying a healthy price for a stock that faces the unfortunate trend of decelerating revenues. Square remains an exceptional company, but the key to the story is paying a better price for future growth."
4134277,104083,2017-12-28T12:22:36-05:00,"Square is among the top technology performers of 2017, up 162% YTD.The Bitcoin trend hit the mainstream this year and shows little signs of weakness.Square recently released a beta for Bitcoin trading on their cash app.Square's latest Bitcoin ventures will not translate to revenue in the near term, but may be a catalyst for the company in the future.Consider Square as an alternative to buying Bitcoin.","The latest Bitcoin craze may be too risky for traditional investors, but there is still opportunity to capitalize on the trend. Bitcoin itself has had an astronomical year, up 2294% at the time of writing this article. Bitcoin currently has a market cap of 265B, 45% of the total crypto market. Square (SQ) has also held its own, up 162% in the past year. Rightfully so, the stock has received a lot of attention for stellar performance, and recent connections to Bitcoin. (Figure: Bitcoin Price YTD, Source, Bitcoin.com)(Figure: Square Price YTD, Source: ycharts.com)Square is not alone in their crypto ventures, most recently Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) announced their intentions to open a Bitcoin trading desk. The Goldman announcements following the New York Stock Exchange intentions to bring multiple Bitcoin ETFs to market. Alternatively, many other Wall Street giants are taking a wait and see approach with Bitcoin. Still the trend is clear, companies are making strategic moves into the cryptocurrency market. While bears are watching intently from the sidelines. Square has shown an impressive track record of innovating payment technology through software and hardware offering. By utilizing their point of sale technology and capital lending services, they have incredible sources for consumer financial data. Being one of the first large public companies to become involved in the bitcoin ecosystem, Square is positioning themselves well if the Bitcoin bull case is true. Worst case, the company can dismiss the experiment and phase out the venture with a simple application update. Square will take away valuable blockchain currency knowledge that likely has a role in the financial markets moving forward.By offering a Bitcoin trading platform they can immediately have an impact on the current crypto exchange landscape. Currently the space is dominated by companies such as Coinbase. Coinbase is an online platform for buying crypto currencies including Bitcoin among a few others. They have been the most popular platform for new investors lately, but have received allegations of insider trading. Also the company has received backlash for multiple trading pauses, claiming the site has been delayed by high volume. Furthermore, customers and Bitcoin users face relatively high trading fees with the service. Coinbase Fee Structure(Figure: Coinbase Fee Structure, Source: Coinbase.com)If the past is an indication of the future, Square will find a niche in payment transactions. For example, Square gained traction in the payment processing market by offering a simple pricing structure of 2.75% for swiped transactions. Combining an attractive pricing structure with intuitive hardware, Square made a name for itself at storefronts across the country. With the advent of Square capital, they provided small business loans designed to ""eliminate paperwork and lengthy application processes"" according to the latest letter to shareholders.Square's business model is well positioned to capitalized on the crypto market, primarily Bitcoin. If Square can establish a viable bitcoin trading platform and integrate it into their current offering, they can capture a share of Bitcoin users that are unsatisfied on unproven, highly criticized platforms such as Coinbase. By entering the Bitcoin transaction market, Square can further diversify their revenue streams to join their already successful payment processing and loan services. While the recent price increases have been a product of the Bitcoin hype, this venture is something to keep an eye on in 2018. I believe Square will continue their recent success and establish a price point of $40/share in 2018. As their Bitcoin service matures, it will serve as a catalyst for the company to push toward, and possibly reach $50 by the end of 2018.Although Bitcoin is an extremely volatile investment, Square is an alternative to invest in the asset. If you believe in the legitimacy of Bitcoin and it's applications but are hesitant to invest in the currency directly for security or volatility reasons, invest long in a company like Square. If Bitcoin is successful Square will feel the effects, but if it is not, Square has a proven business model to maintain their value."
4130144,103976,2017-12-06T13:22:57-05:00,Square has enjoyed steady gains and appears to be a favorable acquisition target amidst the consolidation in the digital payments industry.Square has a large amount of convertible debt on its balance sheet.The large amount of overhang could dissuade potential investors and strategic buyers due to dilution and an intense due diligence process.,"Square (NYSE:SQ) has enjoyed a nearly 196% YTD increase in its stock price and been the subject of investor optimism throughout the year. With such rapid growth and increasing consolidation in the digital payments industry, some investors are left wondering why Square has not been acquired by another tech firm.Square offers a niche service enabling businesses to turn their mobile and computing devices into payment and point-of-sale solutions through sophisticated software and affordable hardware. Revenues have grown 38.62% and 48.41% during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively, and, despite being such a young company, total cash flow and cash flow from operations have both been positive for two of the last three years. Square Capital, a service that offers loans to sellers based on their payment processing history, is an innovative development that has further contributed to the surge in Square's stock price (currently trading at $39.31). As of September 30, 2017, Square Capital has been one of the main drivers of subscription and services-based revenue, which has increased by $29.7 million or 84% and $84.4 million, or 95%, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.Among the various tech firms breaking into the growing digital payments industry, some investors consider Square to be an ideal takeover target for the online payments company PayPal (PYPL). PayPal could use Square to further its presence in brick-and-mortar retail stores and further promote Venmo through these platforms. After other payment processing companies have made similar acquisitions, like Vantiv's (VNTV) acquisition of WorldPay, such a deal seems even more urgent. Furthermore, with over $2.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet, operating cash flows of nearly $2.7 billion, and $170 million in debt associated with its recent acquisition of Swift Financial already paid off, it seems as if PayPal is well poised to finance another acquisition.So, why has such a young and successful tech company with an innovative product not been acquired by a company like PayPal yet? It is true that many U.S. tech companies are trying to expand their geographic presence through the acquisition of companies overseas, but part of the answer could lie in the company's capital structure. As of September 30, 2017, Square had $354 million in long-term debt on its balance sheet, all of which is convertible debt. In fact, on March 6, 2017, Square issued $440 million of convertible debt, which is convertible at an initial conversion rate of 43.5749 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. This translates to a conversion price of nearly $22.95 per share of Class A common stock. To hedge its position, Square has the option to purchase 19.2 million shares of the Class A common stock at a price of $22.95 per share and sold warrants to counterparties, which gives it the option to purchase 19.2 million shares of Class A common stock at a price of $31.18 per share. Such a large amount of convertible debt on the balance sheet could potentially dissuade potential strategic buyers from acquiring Square. With convertible debt comes the threat of dilution, and with such a rapidly growing company like Square, it seems as if many of the convertible bonds will actually be converted to common stock. This should ring in the ears of investors as well. As the options are exercised, Square's earnings will be spread over a larger number of shares, so it is important that investors consider the effect of dilution.Square's recent issuance of convertible debt this year highlights the confidence management and investors have in the growth of the company, but creates more overhang that could further push buyers away. Additionally, all of this convertible debt would make for an extremely long and expensive due diligence process for any strategic buyer. This is coupled with the fact that Square has two classes of common stock. Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share, and Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share. Square does not have any Preferred Stock outstanding, but it is authorized to issue one billion shares of it. While not uncommon, it further complicates the due diligence process that would follow if an acquisition were to occur, and the difference in voting rights could contribute to certain shareholders with more power to prevent a deal from going through.A closer look at Square's capital structure reveals that acquiring Square is not just a quick process that any tech firm can undertake without thinking twice. With all the hype and success stories surrounding tech startups, it is easy to overlook some of these fundamental issues. This is not to say that Square is not a solid acquisition target or investment opportunity - it offers an innovative and extremely useful product and service and has a solid operating history. However, these are not the only things that matter from an acquisition standpoint, and it is important that investors at least consider these factors when purchasing shares of the company as well."
4146285,22148,2018-02-13T16:28:36-05:00,Square cooled off following another run towards $50 due to the Bitcoin craze.The company is unlikely to attract large Bitcoin trading volumes as other services already corner the market.The valuation remains stretched as revenues aren't even set to top $1 billion for 2017.,"Square (SQ) was trading back towards the all-time highs near $50 due to more excitement around Bitcoin before the market collapse. The stock valuation remains aggressive considering the limited utilization of the Cash App and the crashing value of cryptocurrencies. Square has now failed on two runs at $50.Square announced interest in implementing Bitcoin going back a few months ago. The stock surged to nearly $50 and a market valuation of around $18 billion based on digital currency hype.My previous research labeled the rally as irrational and the stock quickly tumbled back into the $30s. Bitcoin has now tumbled over 50% from the highs to only $8,600, yet Square raced back up to the highs on the release of the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin via the Cash App.Cash App on TwitterSquare remains an innovative payments company so the inclusion of digital currencies should provide no surprise. The Cash App already allows people to immediately transfer money and make payments without needing a traditional bank account and can quickly integrate into the existing financial system.The one reason for hope is that Coinbase estimated that revenues topped $1 billion last year. Square though doesn't have any clear indication of how the company will earn money based on customers buying and selling the cryptocurrency. Coinbase charges a fee on each transaction and reportedly had over 13 million accounts.Based on the FAQ, customers will pay a margin or spread with each transaction and presumably Square will keep a portion of that amount:The Cash app is a small portion of the business at Square where transaction volumes on mobile payments dominate. The addition of Bitcoin trading could drive demand and investors will want to watch for such indications.Net revenues are targeted at $1.28 billion in 2018 and $1.65 billion in 2019 after hitting $950 million last year. The stock has a valuation of nearly $15 billion even after the market sell-off.SQ Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsThe success of Coinbase adds some indication that cryptocurrency volumes are now large enough to drive revenue growth, but the innovative Square might actually be behind the curve. Coinbase already has 13 million accounts and allows customers to trade in additional currencies like Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum.The more sophisticated and larger buyers are likely to stay with the leader in the sector than shift assets to Square. For this reason, Bitcoin trading will remain a marginal business for the mobile payments provider. Even based on the 2019 revenue total that factors in 29% growth, Square already trades at 9x those revenue estimates.Nomura placed a $64 price target on the stock, but the key that investors need to understand is that the stock doesn't deserve such a valuation. Square doesn't deserve a market value in excess of the current $15 billion valuation unless animal spirits' re-emergence due to the Bitcoin craze.The key investor takeaway is that Square has made two irrational runs above $40 due to the Bitcoin craze. Without Coinbase-type volumes that are unlikely, the stock can't justify trading into the $40s."
4128227,22148,2017-11-28T18:57:03-05:00,Square fell on a negative analyst call.The stock rally was propped up by irrational excitement over cryptocurrency.Key sales metrics point to decelerating revenue growth that will end the rally.,"Based on a simple downgrade, Square (SQ) plunged 16% on Monday. Dip buyers bidding the stock up on Tuesday should be aware that my previous research identified the stock as priced for perfection back at $39. Though the sell off on Monday appeared brutal, Square only crossed $41 for the first time as recently as November 15. Should dip buyers resist the urge this time around?The main thesis of the BTIG call (login required) is similar to mine in that Square traded at an extreme multiple that discounted years of fast growth while ignoring some possible risks on the horizon. The $30 price target is actually similar to where a previous call recommended buying the mobile payments provider on dips.Basically, Square hit a market valuation around $19 billion as the stock approached $50 last week while adjusted revenues won't even reach $1 billion this year. Mark Palmer of BTIG has a target of $964 million for the year while the company guided to a similar goal. Square originally set a revenue target of $890 million for 2017 so the market is probably starting to assume large revenue beats will continue.The analyst is slightly below the average analyst estimate for this year, but mostly inline. The key though is that analysts only forecast Square reaching $1.27 billion next year.BTIG is down at only $1.21 billion so Mr. Palmer starts deviating from the crowd with this call. The average analyst calls for revenue growth of 31.5% in 2018 while BTIG is down at only 25.9% growth.The deviation though isn't why Square dipped 16% on this call or why the stock is priced for perfection at $39. Regardless of the forecasts, the company is poised for decelerated growth, which the market hates.SQ Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsThe average analyst expects revenue growth to dip to only 33% by Q1 after hitting 45% in Q3. Square tends to beat estimates, but the company needs a massive beat to get these estimates to end up with accelerated growth.Part of this reason is that GMV growth is slowing and ancillary services can only push the needle so far. Volumes have slowed from 39% growth last Q3 to only 31% in the last quarter. Source: Square Q3'17 shareholder letterBTIG thinks Square Capital has some credit risk issues that were unearthed via the $3.4 million credit loss reported in Q3. Square Capital only grew loan volumes 45% in Q3, down from 68% YoY growth in the prior quarter. In fact, loan volumes dipped from 49,000 businesses and $318 million in loans during Q2 to only 47,000 businesses and $303 million in Q3.Regardless of whether BTIG or the market is right about sales growth, Square is an extremely expensive stock now trading at 27.2x 2020 EBITDA estimates of $610 million. Even assuming BTIG is too conservative on their estimates and the company hits $700 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020, the stock trades at 23.7x those estimates.Note that the company only guided to 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $133.5 million. To hit the $610 million 2020 EBITDA target of BTIG, Square has to grow the number by over 350% over the next three years.The prime reason that Square soared from $40 to nearly $50 was the mention of Bitcoin a day following my previous article on November 13. The company enabled the Square Cash app to buy, sell and hold bitcoins sending the stock soaring in an irrational fashion in just a few trading days.SQ data by YChartsThe move doesn't allow people to even make payments to friends via Bitcoin or even venture into any of the standard mobile payments business arena as the CFO was clear on CNBC that sellers weren't requesting this option. What the move does is validate Square as a fintech innovator willing to listen to customers and explore new avenues of business.The company isn't likely to make any money on Bitcoin in 2018 if the only application using cryptocurrency is the Square Cash app. The loss on Monday didn't even bring the stock back to the $39 level where Square traded prior to the Bitcoin hype. The key investor takeaway is that Square is still worth roughly $16.6 billion while 2018 financial metrics such as sales are targeted at levels below $1.3 billion and BTIG only forecasts adjusted EBITDA reaching $234 million. The company remains an incredible innovator, but the market is insanely pricing in future growth valuing the stock at roughly 71x these adjusted EBITDA targets.Forget going out to 2020 estimates where the stock still remains expensive. Square traded up to nearly $50 on irrational reasons suggesting a rally that won't hold, especially considering key sale metrics point to decelerating growth."
4125723,103859,2017-11-16T21:13:11-05:00,"Square is up roughly 200% YTD at an all-time high. Its current valuation is out of control, even with growth priced in.Square's revenue stream is not diversified; with 87% coming from transactions, the business is inherently risky.At 2.75% per swipe, Square's payment processing fee is on the high end of the spectrum. This could invite disruptive competitors and limit its international growth.There have been a few insider sales.Square's promotion of Bitcoin baffles me; I see Bitcoin as Square's biggest threat.","If someone were to ask me what I think of Square, Inc. (SQ) I'd have more than a few good things to say, starting with its financials. In the first three quarters of 2017, Square had a ~40% YoY adjusted revenue increase and ~32% YoY gross payment volume. The company in relatively good financial health with a 1.81 current ratio as of Sept. 30, 2017. The company also has a state-of-the-art payment ecosystem that provides solutions for countless small businesses in an ever-expanding market. Anyone who has used the Square system can tell you how seamless and easy it is to use.Source: Square's Q3 Shareholder LetterUnsurprisingly, Square's stock price has more than reflected the company's good performance. Q3 results sent the stock price above $40, up almost 200% YTD. On Nov. 15, it announced a new initiative to make buying and selling Bitcoin available on its platform, sending the stock to yet another record high. Before yesterday, it was the second largest position in my portfolio and one of my best performers.However, I am increasingly wary of the stock price, which is currently trading as if it's without risks. After seeing that it jumped another 2% after the Bitcoin news, I decided to sell my entire position. A quick skim of the SQ Stocktwits page will tell you that my decision to do so is in the absolute minority. The sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish, and I anticipate more than a few disagreements in the comments section of this article. But, to me, that's precisely part of the problem.""Be fearful when others are greedy."" -- Warren BuffettI am by no means a technical investor. But I do think that the RSI (Relative Strength Index), a popular momentum indicator that measures the speed of stock price movement, is worth a quick look:SQ Stock Price Vs. RSI YTDSource: Fidelity Active Trader ProNotice that every time the RSI goes to a new high, the stock turns red. The RSI is currently sitting near a record high at 82.40, indicating that it's overbought (anything over 70 is considered overbought).Rest assured that the RSI alone does not mean that the stock price won't go up. In fact, SQ has been considered overbought for weeks. So why sell now?SQ's stock price, even with growth priced in, doesn't make sense to me anymore. It is currently trading at 162 times its 2017 forecast earnings. In comparison, Paypal (PYPL) is trading at 54 times 2017 forecast earnings, which is not low by any standards. To match Paypal's P/E, Square needs a 296% increase in its current EPS. Considering Square's recently improved but still low EBITDA margin of 13% in Q3, this kind of increase will likely take years. It could just be a matter of time when the stock price corrects itself to a more reasonable value.87% of Square's 2017 revenue comes from the transaction-based fees. That in itself is risky. Also, with a fee of 2.75% per swipe and a low profit margin, the company can't really afford to lower its prices. And that invites the very real possibility of a disruptor. The high price also limits its ability to expand globally. My company in China accepts credit cards and the POS fee is a mere 0.06%. Some might say that Square is more than just a payment company, as its software provides a streamlining of services beyond payment. That's true, but the high cost should still make it challenging for Square to invade countries like China, which has a significantly lower fee.Source: SquareWithin the past few days, there have been a few instances of insider selling activities:Source: FidelityJim Mckelvey, the co-founder of Square, cashed in 400,000 options and CEO Jack Dorsey gave away 286,000 options. Keep in mind, however, that the amount of these sales is small compared to their remaining holdings, so this doesn't say anything about the fundamental outlook for the company by any means. Nonetheless, I do think the timing of these sales tells a story about the near-term future of the stock.I don't think I can finish my point without mentioning today's big news, SQ's incorporation of Bitcoin. Jim Cramer called it ""something big."" Zach Miles of Techcrunch.com actually tested it and called the experience ""instant and seamless."" However, I view Bitcoin as a negative for Square. The very purpose of Bitcoin is to decentralize currencies and eliminate the control of government and third-parties, thus eliminating transaction fees -- the bread and butter of Square. So why would anyone think Bitcoin is good for Square? If every merchant started accepting bitcoin, Square would go bankrupt. The only logical explanation I could come up with is that Square does not really believe in Bitcoin, but sees a short-term opportunity to profit from Bitcoin trades.For me, SQ's current risk is much bigger than its reward. The stock had a phenomenal run and is now overvalued, even after pricing in substantial growths. For the first time in a while, I had to sell a company that I like."

Despite that, I find shares of Square continue to be 35% overvalued and place their fair value at $27/share. I am excited to see Square's launch of Bitcoin sales in Square Cash, but believe it will have relatively little impact on the company's top and bottom line.While I believe in Square as a company, shares have simply rallied too far, perhaps on the back of irrational exuberance over Bitcoin's recent rally. Until shares of the company fall back to Earth, I will remain on the sidelines.Source: Square, Inc.Square is primarily known for its Square Reader and Square Register products, which allow businesses to accept credit cards, debit cards, and other payment methods. These point-of-sale systems have allowed entrepreneurs and small businesses to accept credit cards where they may not have otherwise been able to offer this service. Square was founded by its CEO, Jack Dorsey, who is also the CEO and co-founder of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).Although Square charges for its hardware, Square's revenue is primarily generated by transaction fees. For example, the Square Register accepts all major cards for a cost of 2.5% plus 10 cents per transaction. This transaction-based revenue accounts for 88% of Square's total revenue over the past 12 months, while hardware sales make up 2% of the company's revenue.These terminals are Square's best asset as a company. Square's services are widely used and widely known. This enables Square to reach customers at a much higher rate than some of its lesser-known peers. Square also benefits from a simple payment system, although it can be more expensive than its peers. Further, consumers know and trust Square devices, whereas some consumers may be skeptical of lesser-used processing systems. Square's branding thereby provides it with some level of enduring competitive advantage, although this is contingent on Square continuing to offer competitive products with its peers, including Clover Go and PayPal Here (NASDAQ:PYPL).Three services make up the remaining 10 percent of Square's revenue and are categorized by the company as subscription and services-based revenue. Square Instant Deposit offers Square users the ability to have funds instantly deposited into their account, for a 1% fee, instead of using free payments which take one to two business days. Caviar is a service which allows users to order food for either delivery or pickup which Square acquired in 2014 for about $100 million. Rounding out Square's services, Square Capital offers small business loans and financing in order to allow them to grow. Together, these three businesses contribute 10% to Square's revenues.^NYB data by YChartsBitcoin has been in the news quite a bit recently, with the cryptocurrency breaking through the $9,000 barrier, and nearing $10,000. As I write, Bitcoin is currently trading at $9,800 on a popular trading site. Bitcoin is a fascinating technology and is a tiny part of my portfolio (less than one bitcoin), although its current price is divisive, with plenty of bulls and bears alike.Square has gotten into the Bitcoin spotlight as well, with word that the Square Cash app is letting some of its users use the app to purchase Bitcoin. This support is still being tested, according to Tech Crunch, but could potentially allow customers to buy and sell Bitcoin using the app.Source: Google TrendsThis could potentially be big news for both Square and for Bitcoin. Bitcoin's popularity (and price) is at an all-time high, and Square could be one of the first major, publicly-traded companies to allow users to trade the currency, which could aid wider adoption of the currency.Further, Square could potentially increase its revenue through Bitcoin sales. Daily Bitcoin volume is, according to Bitcoinity, approximately 150,000 bitcoins, or about $1.47 billion. Trading fees at major exchanges tend to be around 0.1% to 0.2% per side, while fees at less specialized sites tend to be around 1.5% plus credit card processing fees where applicable. Square's pricing structure is likely to align with that of Coinbase.Square's revenue from this business is highly speculative. While the market is a billion-dollar market, Square's portion of that market is likely to be smaller. For example, Square might attract 5 million Bitcoin customers by 2019, and each might purchase $500. With 1.5% commissions, this would represent slightly more than 1% of Square's revenue in 2019. This relatively small contribution is part of what led Mark Palmer to downgrade the stock:Square's relationship with Bitcoin is also potentially dangerous due to the dramatic price fluctuations of the currency. Square could potentially be impacted by large price movements if Square holds a large float of the currency to buy and sell to customers rather than merely offering an exchange. Further, customers' trust in Square could be hurt if they purchase the currency through Square Cash and it subsequently declines in value.For this reason, I view the offering as somewhat of a double-edged sword. While I am personally long a small amount of Bitcoin, it is a highly risky asset, and Square should balance the risks to its balance sheet and reputation with the potential gains from offering the currency.Square has also been in the news recently for its application to become a bank. Square filed an application to become an industrial loan company (an industrial bank) with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Square's bank would be headquartered in Salt Lake City and capitalized with $56 million.In an interview, Square's head of lending, Jacqueline Reses, described the bank as allowing Square Capital to offer small-business loans directly and to also offer deposit products to small businesses. Square Capital loans are currently available but are issued by Celtic Bank rather than Square.In his downgrade of Square to a sell, Mark Palmer also expressed disapproval of this decision and contrasted the decision with PayPal selling its U.S. credit assets:I appreciate that Square is attempting to remove its dependence on Celtic Bank or other outside banks, but the move to become a bank is dangerous. As Mr. Palmer suggests, increasing the financial complexity of the company makes it much more difficult to value accurately. This is a problem that current General Electric (GE) shareholders are familiar with, as GE is a notoriously complex company, which may have masked its recent problems until it was too late.SQ data by YChartsUnlike my recent valuation of GameStop (GME), I am bullish on the future of Square. Square's prospects in the future are strong despite competition from PayPal and others, due to its strong product offering, simple fee structure, and great brand recognition as a first-mover in the industry.I have used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value Square. To do this, I have calculated its cash flows for the next 10 years. Using a DCF longer than five years is necessary because Square is growing so quickly: Square's subscription and services-based revenue has risen 92% TTM, while Square's transaction-based revenue (from point-of-sales systems) has risen 33% TTM. Accordingly, I believe it will take more than five years for Square to reach a terminal growth rate.Figure 1: Valuation ResultsBased on my valuation of Square, I value the company at $27 per share. While I am bullish on Square's likelihood of continued success in the future, I believe that the company is overvalued by the market. Shares have climbed from $12 to over $40 in the past year. In my view, this ascent has far exceeded the underlying value of the cash flows of Square, and Square is due for further price corrections to return to its true value.The terminal growth rate used here is the same as my risk-free rate, and all values are discounted back at the appropriate cost of capital (see Figure 4). Values of options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and convertible debt are all based on the current Square stock price of $41.Figure 2: Fourth Quarter and Annual ProjectionsAbove are my projections with for the fourth quarter, as well as for each year from 2018 to 2027. I expected revenue growth of 28.1% in 2017, based on Square's fourth quarter projections. I expect this revenue growth to rise slightly in 2018 (due to continued strong growth in subscription and services-based revenue, see Figure 3), before ultimately declining to a terminal growth rate. In this projection, Square's terminal revenue is $8.4 billion. This is approximately 5x Square's 2016 revenue but is still lower than PayPal's revenue.Adjusted revenue is a non-GAAP measure that Square uses, which excludes past Starbucks-related (NASDAQ:SBUX) revenue and also excludes the cost of revenue for transaction-based revenue. This is intended to be a better measure of revenue, according to the company, since the transaction-based costs are largely processing fees paid to credit card companies. Because Square typically uses this figure, I have chosen to project it here as well.The changes in gross profit margin are driven by changes in the makeup of Square's revenue, as shown in Figure 3. I expect Square's tax rate to be 0% until its loss carryforward burns off in the middle of 2020. After that, I project a 35% tax rate. Based on this projection, I expect Square to make an operating profit for the first time in 2018 and for that operating profit to grow steadily in the coming years as revenue also rises.Figure 3: Growth and Gross Margins By SegmentBy segment, I project transaction-based revenue and subscription and services-based revenue to decline to a terminal growth rate in 2027. However, I project Square to continue growing its revenue by double-digits until 2024. I expect Square to maintain its COGS margins on transactions and on hardware. For subscription and services-based costs, I expect the company to continue to make small gains, having moved from 61% gross margins in 2015 to 70% in 2017.I also expect that Square will be able to lower its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in the future. Because of economies of scale, Square's R&D costs and SG&A costs are unlikely to continue to match revenue growth in the future, leading to increased margins.Figure 4: Cost of CapitalMy valuation is based on Square maintaining an optimal debt ratio in the future. This debt ratio is optimized, to the nearest 10%, based on bond ratings by interest coverage ratio. Averaging to the nearest 10% results in a slightly ""lumpy"" cost of debt, but minimized the cost of capital to Square in any given year, based on their tax rate.The beta I am using is an adjusted bottom-up beta. Square's regression beta is not meaningful, due to the limited period of time Square has been trading. To get a beta, I have taken an unlevered beta from a collection of financial services firms and averaged those betas. I further adjusted that unlevered beta each year, so that as Square matures into a stable, low-risk company, its unlevered beta will decline to that of its larger peers. Accordingly, Square's unlevered beta declines from 1.81 down to 1.03, which is the average of its larger peers' betas.I have then levered the unlevered beta, and multiplied by the equity risk premium and added the risk free rate. The equity risk premium here reflects that Square's business is almost exclusively conducted in the United States rather than in riskier overseas markets. The resulting cost of equity is then weighted averaged with the cost of debt (after tax) to form a cost of capital. Using this method, my cost of capital begins at 11.0% but declines to 6.8% as Square reaches maturity.Figure 5: Cost of Capital SensitivityFor those who prefer to use their own costs of capital, I have also provided a cost of capital sensitivity analysis. Each of these costs of capital is a constant cost of capital, rather than the varying cost of capital that I have used for my valuation.As shown by movement on Monday, analyst ratings provide a potentially potent catalyst for movement in Square's price. Further catalysts include:I am bullish on Square's future as a company. Square has a strong brand name with good recognition from consumers and small business owners. Square offers great point-of-sales products with simple fee structures. Square combines this offering with a strong analytics package and useful features, including Instant Deposit. These factors will allow Square to continue its double-digit growth well into the future. Square may also be able to capitalize on becoming a source for Bitcoin in the future.Despite that, I find Square overvalued. I place the value of shares of the company at $27/share, which is 35% less than their current price. For this reason, I would avoid shares of Square as an investor. Because of the high-growth nature of Square, short-selling shares of Square is quite risky. However, long-term puts may limit downside risk while still providing strong returns if Square's price continues to falter.(I typically invest in a retirement account that does not have access to margins or to options, so I will remain on the sidelines.)"
4125127,23998,2017-11-15T10:50:20-05:00,"It's unusual enough for one CEO to helm two separate public companies simultaneously, but the divergence between Square and Twitter over the past couple of years has been remarkable.Our system has been bullish on Square recently, including it in an aggressive portfolio we presented to our Marketplace subscribers last month.We update the interim performance of that portfolio here, note the divergent opinions on Square now, and present a couple of ways longs can limit their risk.","Image via Square's Twitter pageShares of Square (SQ) have been on a tear this year, but on Seeking Alpha, opinions diverge about where it goes next. We've been bullish on it. Below, we recap the portfolio we included it in last month, update its performance, and present a couple of ways Square shareholders can stay long while limiting their risk in the event we end up being wrong. Let's take a moment first to consider the extraordinary juxtaposition between Square and Jack Dorsey's other company, Twitter (TWTR). Almost two years ago, Seeking Alpha contributor SevenSeas Research highlighted the challenges Jack Dorsey faced helming Square and Twitter at the same time (""A Part-Time CEO Facing Full-Time Problems""). Since then, it's been Twitter's share price that has lagged while Square's has soared. As D.M. Martins Research suggested recently (""Square Can Climb Even Higher""), the divergence is due in part to Square having a ""sticky"" business model and being exposed to the right trends and sectors:This is in contrast to Twitter, which, as we've argued, has never adopted its natural business model, of facilitating commerce between frequent users. While D.M. Martins Research saw more upside in store for Square, Stone Fox Capital argued Square was ""priced for perfection,"" comparing its valuation to that of a competitor in the payments space, and concluding that Square has ""significant downside risk"":Our Portfolio Armor system has been bullish on Square recently, including it in an aggressive portfolio we presented to our Bulletproof Investing subscribers last month. More on that in a moment, but we should note here that Portfolio Armor has actually been even more bullish on PayPal recently. It's been one of our site's top 10 names fairly consistently since August 3rd.Square is currently the No. 19 name in our system, and it appeared in our October 12th aggressive portfolio below, alongside several of our other top names at the time: Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU), Cognex (CGNX), Netflix (NFLX), Nvidia (NVDA), and TakeTwo Interactive (TTWO). We called this an aggressive portfolio, because Square and the other securities in it were hedged against greater-than-20% declines, rather than single-digit declines as in some of our recent examples of hedged portfolios. If each of the underlying securities in it does well, this should outperform the hedged portfolios with smaller decline thresholds, because of its lower hedging cost. On the other hand, if one of these stocks declines significantly, it will have more of an impact than it would in one of the more tightly hedged portfolios. Our system's hedged portfolios each last for six months. The one above is only a little more than a month old, but here is its performance so far, versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY):In case we're wrong about Square, and Stone Fox Capital is right about it being priced for perfection, we'll present a couple of ways of hedging it below. The first hedge is fairly expensive, and is presented mainly for informational purposes. The second hedge has a negative cost, and is an updated version of the Square hedge in the portfolio above, from last month. In both cases, we'll assume you have 1,000 shares of Square and are unwilling to risk a decline of more than 20% over the next several months. Positive Cost, Uncapped UpsideAs of Tuesday's close, these were the optimal, or least expensive, puts to hedge 1,000 shares of SQ against a greater-than-20% decline by mid-June.As you can see above, the cost of this protection was $3,700, or 9.31% of position value. This was calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts, so you could probably have opened this hedge for a bit less. Nevertheless, we assume this will be more than most readers would want to pay to hedge (but feel free to tell us if we're wrong about that). Negative Cost, Capped UpsideHere, we use Portfolio Armor's current potential return estimate for Square, 25%, as an upside cap. This was the optimal, or least expensive, collar, as of Tuesday's close, to hedge 1,000 shares of SQ against a >20% decline by mid June, while not capping your possible upside at less than 25% by then. Due to the negative net cost of this collar, our algorithm was, after an iterative process, able to find a less expensive strike for the put leg of this collar, the cost of which was $2,250, or 5.66% of position value. The income generated by the short call leg below was a bit higher though: $2,400, or 6.04% of position value. This income was calculated conservatively, using the bid price of the calls.So the net cost of this collar was negative, meaning you would have collected $150, or 0.38% of position value when opening the hedge, assuming you placed both trades at the worst ends of their respective spreadsIf you own Square now, and want a shot at additional gains while limiting your risk, one of the hedges above is worthy of consideration. But you also may want to consider a holistic approach, where you are buying and hedging a handful of securities that offer the best potential returns, net of hedging costs, given your risk tolerance. We think that may be a better approach to portfolio construction."

My previous research suggested that buying the stock on any dip below $28 after last quarter was the safest way to play the mobile payments market.The stock though ended the week at $39 now and the updated guidance for full year revenues only rose about $35 million at the midpoint or around 4% of total revenues. The question is whether investors have any upside potential after the stock has risen over 30% since the last quarter and some 300% since the 2016 lows?Square reported adjusted revenues of $257 million and beat estimates by an incredible $12 million. The company continues hitting on all cylinders as movements into registers, virtual terminals and loans expand market opportunity all while moving up the food chain to larger sellers. The market always likes a company that can reaccelerate growth at rates above 40%. Q1 revenue growth dipped to only 39% and the last two quarters have ramped back up to above 41% growth and hit 45% during Q3. Source: Square Q3'17 shareholder letterThe market though apparently glazed over the guidance for Q4 revenue growth of only 37%. Square has to beat revenue estimates by about $15 million or the company is back into a decelerating growth situation that never ends well for a pricey stock.The forecast is nothing horrible from a company standpoint when growth could still top 40%, but a big problem for a stock with a valuation approaching $15 billion when including diluted share counts. Remember that the revenue run rate is only $1 billion now. At some point, the issue of profitability will pop up into the market concern. Stripping out stock-based compensation and Square produced a small profit in the $24 million range for the quarter and somewhere around $64 million for the year. Source: Square Q3'17 shareholder letterEven an annual profit before taxes in the $100 million range would place the stock trading at 150x earnings. An even easier way to value Square is that the stock trades at 112x EBITDA estimates of $133.5 million for 2017. Another way of viewing the incredible ramp in the stock is this simple comparison to another hot payments stock in PayPal Holdings (PYPL). Square started the year trading a premium P/S multiple in comparison to PayPal, but the stock now trades at twice the multiple. SQ PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that Square remains an exceptional company priced for perfection. The company could grow at the current rate for several years before justifying the market valuation so investors have to consider that holding the stock at this value has limited upside and significant downside risk."
4121550,92586,2017-11-07T07:41:11-05:00,"Following an impressive run, can Square's stock maintain its momentum?The Street's expectations are set high, but I wonder if another wave of strong results might bump up full-year EPS guidance once againTaking the long-term view, I see SQ as a promising name that is worth further investigation","What a run it has been for Square (SQ). After seeing shares climb +35% since the end of September (that's right, in just about six weeks) and over +200% in the past year alone, the company is set to report 3Q17 earnings this Wednesday, after the closing bell.Following such performance, can the stock maintain its momentum?Source: MarketWatchNet revenue adjusted for transaction-based costs and Starbucks-related (SBUX) transactions is expected to come in at $244.6 million, a +37.4% YOY increase that would approach but not quite reach last quarter's +41% improvement. The Street seems to be very optimistic on the company's performance, as this projected number, if achieved, would exceed the upper limit of management's own guidance range of $241 million. I will be curious to see if momentum in the mid-market seller vertical will continue this quarter, after having witnessed growth in GPV accelerate last quarter to account for nearly one fifth of gross payment volume.Last quarter, a mix shift towards virtual terminals and e-commerce API helped maintain transaction revenue and profit as a percentage of GPV healthy. I would be surprised to see much, if any, deterioration to take rate and gross margins this quarter. Below the gross profit line, however, I find it likely that sales and marketing expenses will continue to come in on the richer side, as Square continues to invest in growth. Potential upside to earnings could come in the form of more subdued general and administrative costs, which have been growing at a much slower pace than revenues and tend not to be associated with with top-line momentum to the same extent as other operating expenses.Consensus EPS estimate of $0.05 is aligned with management's top-end of the guidance. But more importantly than a bottom line beat, I will be attentive to whether the optimism that drove the company to raise full-year earning guidance by four cents per share last quarter will persist. If results continue to come in as strongly as they have recently, we might see management's earnings expectations for 2017 rise to at least meet the Street's consensus $0.24.Although pricey by some measures, particularly for investors who feel much more comfortable playing the value game (as is my case), I appreciate SQ within the high-growth space for a few reasons. First, the company is exposed to macro trends that I perceive to be highly bullish, including strength in small businesses driven by a resilient global economy and an increase in P2P payments. Second, Square has been moving towards diversification across different services (e.g. POS, CRM, small-business loans) that should increase its odds of developing into a larger, profitable payment service company without the risks faced by many young, one-trick-pony tech companies.Third, with its equity valued at a still modest $14 billion, Square is small enough of a pill to be swallowed by peers PayPal (PYPL) or even Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA). Being an M&A target has fueled SQ's price appreciation in the past. But in this case, I believe the rumors and speculations could eventually prove accurate, and sizable stock price appreciation could still be in the works.I find it unlikely that Square will deliver much less than a solid quarter this week. Ensuring further stock price strength, particularly in the short term and following an impressive run, is a whole different story. But taking the long-term view, I see SQ as a promising name that is worth further investigation.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow D.M.

A few pundits were quick, perhaps too much so, to dismiss how the company's robust financial performance could provide uplift to the stock, citing lack of catalysts and aggressive valuations to justify moderate weakness following the print.Four trading days and nearly 9% in share price appreciation later, the markets have spoken. It looks like SQ might have room to climb higher in the end, even after the astonishing 225% run of the past 12 months.Credit: Ozark Radio NewsStock price momentum aside, I was most curious to see if Square could continue to perform as well as it has over the past several quarters, particularly in the very meaningful mid-market seller vertical. As it turns out, strength on this end of the business was credited for a robust GPV increase of 31% in 3Q17, in line with last quarter's growth rate. Perhaps to my surprise, none of Square's operating expense categories increased at a faster pace than revenues, with S&M rising 42% YOY vs. 53% last quarter. As a result, Square was able to use operating leverage to triple adjust EBITDA YOY and push non-GAAP EPS of $0.07 two pennies above consensus.I have recently stated that SQ was a growth stock that I could get behind. An otherwise value investor at heart, I believe Square has a ""sticky"" business model that's exposed to the right trends (including fast growth in small and independent businesses) within a sector that I have recently, and perhaps later than I should have, developed an interest in. It does not hurt that, as I stated before, ""Square has been moving towards diversification across different services (e.g. POS, CRM, small-business loans) that should increase its odds of developing into a larger, profitable payment service company without the risks faced by many young, one-trick-pony tech companies.""Sure, SQ's multiples, particularly when measured by the more commonly available valuation tools, look pretty stretched (see above). But I would argue that Square's growth pace has been very aggressive, and I do not have good reasons to believe that the company will reach a plateau any time soon. Top-line growth has accelerated in the past couple of quarters, reaching 45% in 3Q17. Forward EV/EBITDA is very rich at about 110x on a 2017 basis, but adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase by 200% this year vs. year-ago levels. Meanwhile, adjusted EPS has climbed from only four cents in 2016 to an estimated $0.25 this year and maybe $0.45 in 2018.If one were to look at Square a few years down the road and assume the business remains healthy as it looks like it will, paying $40/share for SQ today might not seem like an outrageous proposition after all.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow D.M.

We will see heightened spending and transaction volume in the consumer sector. Square Inc. is well positioned in a large, comfortable, and expanding niche market as it serves businesses. This figure delineates consumer payment preferences; transaction volume composition between card and cash in the past 4 years rests at a 90/10 split. A shift toward credit cards is an explicit sign the United States’ population is more inclined to take on debt.Square is able to onboard new users in a matter of minutes. Once in the system, Square customers are immediately able to collect payments. Its ventures into spaces occupied by PayPal/Venmo (PYPL) and Snapcash (for individuals’ money transfers) will take market share at a low cost. However, PayPal and Snapchat(SNAP) face stiffer competition from major banks who will mobilize their mobile applications for peer to peer payments and transfers.Square’s competitor, PayPal, charges business 2.9% of a transaction on top of a $0.30 flat rate on the transaction.Square charges only 2.75% of the entire transaction. Moreover, Square comes equipped with add-ons such as data analytics and inventory management, as well as hardware for stores. Square has successfully digitized the common business register. PayPal remains with the advantage of e-commerce offerings; however, Square has improved its e-commerce offering too. Switching costs help Square retain merchants and mobilize the company to penetrate competitors' market share.Square has paid out stock-based compensation each of the last 4 years, dating back before the 2015 IPO. It sits on total assets amounting to $1.2 billion while liable for less than $60 million of long-term debt.

However, Square’s payment processing is noted as the best-in-class by businesses. Square’s peer to peer payment process is rivaled, again, by PayPal’s Venmo. Moreover, Square faces competition from lenders such as banks and alternative lenders.Threat of New Entrants (Moderate Force)Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics make way for new players to walk into the marketplace with a better mousetrap. The market for business solutions is not difficult to penetrate, as new entrants can begin operations with a single merchant.Threat of Substitutes (Strong Force)There is no shortage of payment solution providers. PayPal can slash its transaction fees to entice merchants to employ their solutions.

The mobile-payments provider continues to expand the ecosystem that now includes working towards a banking license that has to be balanced with the higher valuation.The stock has seen a roughly 200% gain off the lows after the disappointing IPO back in 2015. The market misunderstood the opportunity to expand the total addressable market beyond just the small businesses that needed a mobile payments option to a full ecosystem. Has the market now overestimated the business opportunity?Square reported Q2 adjusted revenues of $240.4 million. Revenues absolutely surged from the Q1 levels of $204 million while the annual growth rate actually expanded to 41%.The prime reason for using the adjusted revenue is that transactions have high costs and don't accurately reflect the revenues that Square obtains prior to actual costs of providing services or hardware. For Q2, transaction-based revenue was up at $482.1 million while transaction-based costs were $311.1 million leaving the adjusted revenues for transactions at only $171.0 million or just slightly about 1% of the $16.4 billion gross payment volumes.Investors pay attention to the 2.94% take rate, but the transaction margin is actually much more important. CFO Sarah Friar does a detailed explanation of the situation in the transcript from the Deutsche Bank's 2017 Technology Conference. The take rates for large customers and international locations are typically lower including only 1.75% in the U.K., but the transaction margins can sometimes actually be higher.Source: Square Q2'17 shareholder letterSo when investors look at the adjusted revenue targets of $930 million for the year, the current market valuation in excess of $11 billion based on over 400 million diluted shares appears excessive. Square now trades at roughly 12x revenue estimates.The fintech is only marginally profitable so paying roughly $27.50 for the stock is hard to swallow, especially for those that had all the opportunity in the world to buy Square under $10. The company though continues to expand the ecosystem.Square is looking to get a banking license in Utah for a unit called Square Financial Services. As well, the recent move to allow installment loans for customers of seller accounts expands the lending aspect of the business.For this reason, the company is attractive due to the expanding market outside of mobile payment transactions. Subscription and services-based revenue nearly doubled in the quarter which is the reason that traditional transaction revenues only grew 32% while total adjusted revenues grew at a much higher 41%.The recent trading action in the stock though could easily provide the clues to investors. The valuation concerns are possibly the reason that Square is showing a double top potential around $28 with a lower high this week.The key investor takeaway is that Square has run too far despite the excellent results. Investors should keep an eye on the recent trading action and look for a solid dip to own the mobile payments provider on a dip."
4115056,103793,2017-10-20T12:02:00-04:00,Square as a well-positioned growth stock.Entry into the growing alternative loan industry with Square Capital.Potential massive market share to be captured for inventory tracking software systems: Square for Retail.,"Square's (SQ) success in the point-of-sale system (PoS) area is self evident as many small businesses from different industries have adopted it to streamline their operations. Square has proven to be a market leader by meeting the needs of small businesses through technology. Now, the company is diversifying its services by offering Square Capital and Square for Retail. These two services will allow Square to further gain market share in the micro-loan industry and grow its revenue streamline by aiding the retail industry with powerful inventory management tools.I believe Square is a well-positioned growth play now because of the potential market it can capture in the alternative loan services niche in the future and the continuing revenue growth of 100% YoY in the subscription segment. Square also has been able to bring in a strong base of business owners as customers that do not have the capital to outsource their operations such as payroll and marketing. Along with a friendly interface and easy to use point-of-sale system with competitive fees, Square is currently building a strong moat and brand loyalty.Square Inc. has had a strong YoY revenue growth of 34.9% for fiscal year 2016 along with a robust EPS growth of 70.8% YoY for the same year. According to management guidance, total revenue for FY 2017 is expected to be in the range of $2.14 billion to $2.16 billion, growing at ~27% YoY from a year ago. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $120 million to $128 million in 2017. This will represent a 7-point improvement YoY.Square is expected continue to show sustainable growth in the next few years, primarily driven by its competitive transaction fees charged at their PoS systems across a diversified array of businesses. Supplementing that source with its fastest-growing segment, the subscription-based segment (Caviar, Square Capital and Instant Deposits with Square Cash), which nearly doubled on a year-over-year basis, growing at 100% YoY.Square Capital has shown strong adoption and growth. Loan volume grew 68% year over year. $318 million of loans were facilitated and they were provided to almost 50,000 sellers.Loan amounts provided to business owners are in the range of $500-$100,000. The average loan size is $6,000. The idea behind Square Capital is for small business owners to get approved through a speedy process and not have the inconvenience of asking their relatives or big banks for such micro loans. This is very innovative as Square positions itself as an online lender because they are not competing against big banks or the entire lending industry.Instead, Square is creating a niche in the market to serve businesses that do not want to go through the hassle of taking a large loan from a traditional lending institution. Also, Square uses machine learning, data analytics and automation to approve loan applicants. More than 90% of sellers are automatically approved. This has been successful in managing risk, maintaining loan repayment default under 4%.Square provides the platform to make relatively small alternative loans accessible to its subscribers.According to Harvard Business School, new online marketplaces are disrupting the traditional market for small business loans. New tech-based alternative lenders are providing ""easy to use online applications, rapid loan underwriting, and a greater emphasis on customer service.""Also, 12% of firms under $1 million in revenue seek credit from online lenders such as Square Capital:Figure 1: Source: ""2016 Small Business Credit Survey"" Federal Reserve.Square serves businesses under the Online Lender category to less or equal to $1 million in revenue. It encompasses only 12% of the market. There is still plenty of market share to capture for online lenders such as Square.Why do Small Businesses Use Loans to Grow Their Business:Figure 2: Source: ""2016 Small Business Credit Survey"" Federal Reserve.Businesses use primarily loan capital to grow their business and operating expenses. This greatly reduce the risk of start-ups failing to pay their loans back. Businesses use primarily loan capital to grow their business and operating expenses.Massive Market Share To Be Captured For Inventory Tracking Software Systems: Square for RetailSquare for Retail is a software that gives the retailer inventory management tools that streamline the process and reduces errors.Square created Square for Retail with the approach to help small retailers to smooth their operations by providing inventory management tools that are effective and friendly to use like their point-of-sale systems. Again, Square is trying to capture a niche in the retail market and position themselves as a market leader. According to the company, there are 450,000 small to medium sized retailers in the U.S. alone and they generate over $700 billion in annual gross receipts. By focusing on retail needs such as inventory management, I believe retailers will quickly adopt Square for Retail.I used a Discounted Cash Flow (NYSE:DCF) Model using free cash flow to calculate the intrinsic value of Square Inc. The cash flows were forecasted for the next five years (2017 - 2021). To calculate revenue growth for 2017, I used 13% growth, a more conservative approach than guidance provided by management of 15%. Sales growth estimates were developed by a catalyst revenue breakdown forecasted, using market opportunity estimates. A discount of 11.40% was used. A target price of $39.46 was generated with an upside of 18.78% in comparison to closing share price of $33.22 on 10/16/2017.Figure 3: WACC Calculation:Figure 4: Valuation ResultsFigure 5: Revenue GrowthFigure 6: Discounted Cash Flow ModelTechnology disruption and Security BreachCEO Operating Two Separate CompaniesCrypto Currency As A SubstituteSquare maximizes the usage of their huge database and uses automation, data analytics and machine learning to meet small businesses' needs while keeping a practical, easy to use software and hardware.

4118801,103772,2017-10-31T17:09:17-04:00,"Square's cash flow is increasing by even more than its sales on a percentage basis.Square is becoming more of a cash flow machine, giving it more opportunities to expand its business and reach profitability.With a strong increase in free cash flow relative to its operating cash flow, Square has the ability to allocate more funds to future prospects.","Square (SQ) is a company that is seen as a business of the future with high prospects. As people are starting to move away from cash, Square came in and offered a quick and simple way to pay from your mobile device. The business has grown immensely over the past few years. However, it is still not profitable. This may worry investors as they see a company that possibly does not run its business effectively and will use their money elsewhere. My goal with this article is to show, through the analysis of cash flow ratios, that Square is improving and headed towards profitability.By no means does this analysis completely explain why the stock has gone up, as there are surely many other factors that drove the stock's price up over 100% this year. Cash flow or profitability must be present to experience such growth (take Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for example). Despite Square still not being profitable, my analysis concludes that Square has effectively increased its cash flow in a manner that will cause it to transform into a profitable business model. Here are my findings:SQ data by YChartsThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio compares operating cash flow to sales revenue. Basically, the final number shows how much cash a company is getting for each dollar of revenue. In this case, the higher number the better, as having more cash relative to your revenue shows how well the company is able to turn that revenue into cash that it can invest back into the business.With Square, I'm not that focused on how high the number is, I'm more focused on its growth. Over the past year, it has increased from .017 to .077, representing quite a large increase. In other words, they went from getting a little under 2 cents of cash per dollar of revenue up to nearly 8 cents most recently. This should be appealing to investors because even as Square's revenue has gone up, its cash flow has gone up even more relative to its sales revenue. This is a sign that the company is gaining a greater ability to convert sales into cash, which can be put towards improving their margins, acquiring customers, and so on. If Square is able to continue this trend, positive profit margins will be able to be attained through the offering of new products, obtaining higher end customers, or cutting costs.Source: E-TradeThe Asset Efficiency Ratio measures how much operating cash flow a company has relative to its total assets. In summary, the higher the ratio, the more efficient a business is at using its assets to obtain cash from customers and sales revenue.As can be seen in the table, Square had a negative Asset Efficiency Ratio a little over a year ago. This is understandable for a business that is relatively new, but still, as an investor, it would be ideal to see your money being put into a company that can generate some sort of positive cash flow from its assets. Soon after, Square transitioned into having a positive Asset Efficiency Ratio and has worked its way up to .052. This also can be interpreted as every dollar of assets that Square has is able to generate about 5 cents of cash.A thing to look for when analyzing this ratio is if the company's total assets has increased or decreased over the time period. This is because if a company has decreasing total assets, the Asset Efficiency Ratio will seem to be improving even if the operating cash flow is remaining stagnant or even decreasing. This is not the case for Square, however. It's managing to increase its ratio along with vastly increasing its assets as well, both great signs for a potential investment.As Square establishes its foothold in the mobile payments industry and beyond, I expect the Asset Efficiency Ratio to continue to rise. The Current Liability Coverage Ratio also relates to the Asset Efficiency Ratio, as Square is also becoming much more efficient in paying back its short-term creditors. The ratio compares how much operating cash flow a company has relative to the total amount of current liabilities on its balance sheet.Paying back creditors can put a dent in income, so Square having the ability to pay back quicker means that its cash and income situations are improving. Therefore, with the more and more leftover cash Square is left with due to its increased efficiency in paying back creditors, it can invest more heavily in its assets. This, combined with using its assets much more effectively, will lead to greater cash flow in the future. The final result will be that Square will have significantly more cash available relative to what it has now. Since cash is king in business, there are many ways that this cash can be put into use. Along with investing in their own business, management could take on a more aggressive acquisition strategy, buying more companies that will help contribute more revenue to Square in the future.SQ data by YChartsSource: E-TradeThe Cash Generating Power Ratio divides the operating cash flow by the sum of the operating cash flow, cash inflow from investing, and cash inflow from financing. The final number represents the company's operating cash flow as a fraction of its total cash inflows. Typically, the higher number is better because that means that more of a company's cash flow is coming from its core business, rather than things such as issuing debt or more stock.The original figure of -.23 from Q2 2016 means that Square could not generate enough cash from just its operations, so it had to keep issuing more stock to increase its cash balance. However, looking at the same ratio a year later, that ratio increased to .29. Not only does this mean that Square finally obtained a positive operating cash flow but also means that it no longer needed to rely on financing or offering of more company stock to fund the business's operations. This doesn't mean that Square will never offer marketable securities again, as most large companies issue debt offerings to finance certain ventures. The whole point, though, is that Square doesn't have to issue this debt in order to maintain its operations anymore. Since it has enough cash flow from operations to run its daily business, it can now use the proceeds it receives from issuing debt towards advancing its business through a variety options: such as acquiring companies that will set them up to own the future industry of mobile payments.Source: E-TradeThe FCF/CFO Ratio determines what percentage of a company's operating cash flow is made up of free cash flow. Free cash flow is found by deducting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, resulting in remaining cash that the company can use for expansion, acquisitions, or just backup cash for when the market or industry faces headwinds. If a company has a higher number, it means that the costs of running the everyday business are not reducing the company's cash flow by a large amount.In Q2 of 2016, Square had a ratio of -1.5. This is because, at that time, the business was still experiencing negative cash flows. However, over the next quarter, Square managed to increase this ratio to .525. That means that for every dollar of cash that the business received from operations, it received approximately 53 cents of free cash flow. In other words, once Square paid its capital expenditures, it still had over half of its initial cash to spend on whatever management felt necessary.Investors may be skeptical as to why Squares FCF/CFO ratio dipped back below 0 in Q4 of 2016, and so was I. Looking at the cash flow statement, I saw that Square spent over $25 million on fixed assets - significantly higher than any past or future quarter. A purchase of this magnitude makes sense for a young business, as it needs to fill its business with assets that will help the growth of the business in the future.After the major purchases of fixed assets, Square experienced a sharp decrease in capital expenditures over the next two quarters. Its FCF/CFO ratio increased all the way up to about .850. With Square now being able to use 85% of its operating cash flow towards its business's growth, the stage is now set for the company to make the transition from a non-profitable business to profitable.It is difficult to argue with the notion that Square has a huge amount of growth potential due to the fact that the world is experiencing such a transformative shift into virtual currency. A more reasonable argument, in my opinion, is to point out that it has not yet announced a positive EPS figure. Despite this, Square's cash flow situation has been improving from all aspects, as it grows into becoming a more efficient company. As the company grows the amount of cash it has, it is able to seek out more opportunities to expand its business. This will allow it to acquire more customers and raise its margins, causing it to finally turn into a profitable company. By analyzing these cash flow ratios, I wanted to signal to the investors that it is only a matter of time before Square makes the step into running a profitable business based on its cash flow over the past year. The recent run in its stock price is only just the beginning as Square continues to expand its footprint and develop new products for consumers. By exposing this perspective, investors will have a greater understanding as to how Square's cash flow has grown and how it can translate into a profitable company."
4109869,103696,2017-09-27T13:35:31-04:00,"Data will allow Square to effectively sell its non-transaction based services.Business Analytics, Square Capital, and Payroll capital will help Square hold on to transaction based customers.Square's entry into the rapidly growing alternative loan industry gives real growth potential and justifies Square's high valuation.","Square (NYSE: SQ) is a risky, yet rewarding investment opportunity due to the growth potential of its subscription and loan services. Square Capital will become a main revenue source in the near future due to Square’s access to current PoS customers and the rapid growth of online loans. Furthermore, business analytics, payroll, and marketing services will provide supplemental revenue, and create an economic moat around Square’s PoS revenue. These growth opportunities justify Square’s high valuation, and will lead to substantial gains in the long run.Square’s competitive advantage is the data it receives from point of sale (PoS) services. Transaction based revenue from PoS services is the backbone of Square’s revenue (87% of total Q2 2017 revenue), but it also gathers the data Square needs to successfully expand into other markets and services. Transaction based revenue will likely remain Square’s largest source of revenue in the near future, but Square’s other services will provide supplemental revenue and an economic moat around transaction based revenue. As a tech company, Square knows the power of data, and will make full use of consumer and business data collected from their network of card readers and e-commerce transactions to expand business.Square’s data powers their real time business analytics and payroll services which will become invaluable to small and medium sized businesses. Square has proven their ability to get small and medium size businesses to sign up for their PoS hardware through simple setup, competitive fees, and a friendly interface. Square, however, will keep their existing PoS customers by providing business analytics and payroll services through the same PoS interface. Business owners with less than $500,000 gross payment volume (which make up 81% of Square’s total gross payment volume), often need these analytics and tips to properly run their business. Their businesses are not large enough to outsource these services, so Square’s combination of business analytics, payroll services, and point of sale system provide the simplest, most effective way for small businesses to operate. Furthermore, Square PoS hardware is so widely used that customers and employees know how to operate the interface from prior experience. Although Square’s subscription services only accounted for ~10% of Square’s total revenue, subscription based revenue grew 100% YoY compared to a 32% YoY growth rate for transaction based revenue. Subscription services are expected to grow faster, and now that the software is developed subscription services will have higher profit margins.Square can also use their data to improve their marketing and promotion services. Through Square’s network of PoS hardware, Square can track consumers spending habits and personalize ads and promotions to target the best fitting consumers. Many small businesses also fail to properly run ads and promotions, but if Square can prove their ability to use consumer data to effectively provide marketing and promotion services, Square can further grow subscription revenue and make PoS services even more valuable to small businesses.While these two subscription growth opportunities create an economic moat around Square’s PoS revenue, they will not bring in a large portion of Square’s future revenue. On the other hand, Square’s move into the loan business (Square Capital) will be hugely profitable in the next 5 years. In Q2 2017 Square Capital facilitated over 49,000 business loans totaling $318 million, a 68% YoY increase. Square Capital won’t take over the loan industry, but it has the potential to succeed in the small-micro business loan niche. Historically small businesses turned to local banks for business loans, but new online lenders like OnDeck, Kabbage, and Funding Circle are gaining market share due to their simple application processes and quick credit decisions. Alternative lending to small businesses grew from $800 million in 2013 to $4.8 billion in 2015, and firms with revenues less than $100,000 had the greatest unmet funding needs. Morgan Stanley estimates a 47% CAGR for US small and medium-sized enterprise loan balances through 2020, and expects marketplace/online lenders to issue 13.7% ($47 billion) of these loans.Square Capital is well positioned to succeed due to their access to existing customers and real time data. The shift to online lending shows small businesses pick lenders based on convenience and simplicity, and what could be more convenient than the company that already processes your PoS, payroll, and business analytics services? Square’s entry into lending also makes sense due to their ability to track the finances of their borrowers. Data from PoS services will allow Square to determine current counterparty risk, and track how it changes up to the maturity date. This in-house data will allow Square to save money on outsourcing to data providers, and potentially provide superior data. Furthermore, Square has shown their initiative to expanding into the loan industry by applying for loan licenses during a time of loosening lending regulations.I expect Square to continue its current 100% YoY growth in subscription service revenue, resulting in $240 million from subscription services for Q2 2019. In Q2 2017 cost of revenue for subscription services was only 29% of subscription service revenue, while cost of transaction based revenue was 65% of transaction based revenue. Square’s expansion into subscription and service revenue amid the growing loan industries justifies its -$0.21 EPS. Square may seem expensive, but Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), a comparable, growing company, is trading at a P/S of around 22 while Square is trading at about 5.5. Furthermore, established companies like PayPal and Visa have P/S ratios of 6.5 and 13.25 respectively. Square has spent money expanding into its subscription service ventures, that will pay off in the coming years. Powered by Square Capital, I see SQ becoming profitable by 2018, and reaching $50 in 2019.Investing in Square is reserved for the brave. A young company like SQ could have trouble gaining market share in the transaction business dominated by PayPal (NYSE: PYPL), Visa (NYSE: V), and others. Square also must compete against the swarms of young companies trying to establish themselves in the online loan business. However, Square has competitive advantages and solid growth strategies into multiple developing industries. Business analytics, payroll, and marketing services will provide supplemental revenue, and create an economic moat around Square’s established PoS revenue. Square Capital will also be very profitable in the future due to the rapid growth of the online loan industry and Square’s ability to offer loans to their current PoS customers. SQ has rallied around 130% the past year causing many investors to label it overvalued; however, SQ’s growth potential in high profit margin subscription services will make Square hugely profitable in the next couple years."
4113481,52752,2017-10-14T00:40:55-04:00,"Relentless application of cutting-edge technology sets Square aside from competitors.Fast, accurate and reasonable loan services is SQ’s sweet spot.New tailored Square solutions to service the $700 billion market of small businesses will increase the company's stickiness.","Square (NYSE:SQ) is the brainchild of Jack Dorsey after he faced problems paying for his purchase in 2009. Eight years later, Square is a leading payments player in the global economy. It started trading in 2015 with a share price of $9, and it stands at $33 today. Square had grown its revenue from $850 million in 2014 to $1.7 billion in 2016. It is still unprofitable with earnings of negative $33.5 million in 2016, but losses had shrunk considerably from $107.3 million in 2014.Payments is a crowded field with incumbents such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and challengers such as Stripe, Adyen, Braintree, WorldPay (OTC:WPYGY) and even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Payments. What sets Square aside from the intense competition would be its relentless commitment to automation and machine learning together with its full suite of accompanying services which locks in clients.As an investor, the price which you buy into the company is an important consideration. After a 267% run in three years, the big question would be whether Square is still a good buy. Taking a deeper look into Square’s business would give you the answer.While Square started as a payments service, its expansion into loans is a big attraction for investors. JPMorgan sees Square Capital as the most profitable value-added service in the Square empire. The client onboarding services is fully automated, and Jack Dorsey reported that 99.95% of loan applications gets decided automatically by the system.The average loan size is small at $6,000 but the portfolio loss size is respectable at 4%. The World Bank sets the acceptable microloan loss rate at 5% globally. For small businesses that rely on its payments and point-of-sales services, Square has a strong database to access the credibility of its retail business borrower which it enhances its predictive ability with machine learning and data analytics. Such technology can even extend to consumer loans in the near future.Source: SquareDue to its hefty investments into these leading technologies, Square Capital is comfortable lending to small businesses with less than two years of operating history while mainstream banks pull back. Square’s interest rates are reasonable at between 10% and 16% per annum for small businesses, which is comparable to the bank’s lending rate. Since its inception in 2014, Square Capital had lent $1.8 billion in loans and it has grown by 68% over the previous year.For small businesses that get their first business loan from Square, it is highly addictive which pushes them to use its other suite of services such as POS, CRM, Payroll, and cash management services such as Instant Deposit.Given Square Capital’s strong value proposition for small businesses, it is logical for the company to leverage on this strength into a new adjacent category to provide Square business solutions to various retail verticals such as F&B, professional services, retail and so on which adds to its ecosystem.Jack Dorsey estimated that the 450,000 small and medium businesses in the United States alone generate $700 billion worth of gross receipts. Considering that Square charges 2.65% per transaction, transaction revenue alone would bring in $18.55 billion. We are excluding the added services such as inventory management which are sorely needed.Square’s customer relationship management services allows businesses to gain $10 of sales for every $1 of discount given to selected customers which uses powerful analytics to recommend sales campaign for small business owners.Given Square’s propensity to upsell its clients for more advanced solution, this approach should reduce its hefty cost of sales which currently stands at 66.5% of its revenue. Square is currently on a land grab where it is trying to convince its clients in the US, Canada and UK to accept its superior payments, loans and other ecosystem services. Square aims for a win-win solution with smiling customers that will stick to it for the long run.While Square is unlike to get the Visa (NYSE:V) like 60% margins, we can foresee a reasonable margin of 25% in the next two years on a revenue of $2.5 billion. Square had been very aggressive in its expansion and customer acquisition, which results in losses, but the losses are narrowing. It would be surprising if it were to report over $600 million of profit over the next two years given its current momentum.This is provided if Jack Dorsey decides to focus on profitability over revenue growth. Otherwise, it can take a leaf of out Jeff Bezos' playbook and continue its aggressive expansion. Yes, Square had risen 267% within just three years, but the race had only just begun. Sit tight for more expectation-smashing results."
4113492,41751,2017-10-14T06:46:22-04:00,"Square has built a brand that appeals to young hip entrepreneurs.Square's success has spawned numerous copycat competitors.As the company looks to grow, profits will decline as larger merchants demand more than just convenient point of sale hardware and service.","SQ data by YChartsSquare (SQ) introduced its first mobile phone card reader in late 2009 and almost immediately became the ""go to"" payment processor for start up and micro-merchant businesses in need of basic and cost effective processing for debit and credit cards. Since those nascent ""pre-IPO"" days, the company has grown and evolved from a ""word of mouth"" start up to one that is now intent on using that tenuous foothold to broaden the menu of services it provides to its client base.Much like PayPal (PYPL) before it, Square addressed a need from a previously ignored segment of the small business entrepreneurs - in this case, connecting to the digital payment network in a way that is convenient, secure and, most of all, cost effective. However, the same constituency that perhaps was not worth the effort as a budding start-up micro-business, starts to appear more and more attractive to traditional merchant acquirers if and when they ripen into viable small businesses. And Square then faces a challenge in meeting the evolving needs of those small businesses while remaining cost competitive, or it risks losing them to larger, more integrated merchant acquirers. In other words, Square needs to grow with its customers and to do so it needs to entrench itself into other facets of those businesses beyond just processing payments.Towards that end, the company has made some impressive early strides as it strives to offer a broader array of services. Square Register, for instance, is an application that provides invoices, receipts, inventory management and other analytic features at no additional cost to customers, while other features such as appointment software can be bolted on for a fee. Additional services such as Square Cash, a person-to-person money transfer app; Square Capital, which offers business financing; Caviar, an app that focuses on high-end restaurant service; and Square Payroll, that allows small business owners to process payroll for their employees; are all designed to allow the company to compete at a higher level and, more importantly, make switching to another provider a more involved process than just changing your transaction processor. Recently, the company applied for a bank charter so it can originate its own small business loans. In addition, the company has opened its software platform to third-party developers as it strives to create a more beneficial integrated network of services.Still, switching costs - the time, effort and financial cost for a customer to change payment vendors - remains low. And while Square has established a recognizable brand that it's justifiably proud of, it has not translated into much by way of pricing power. Put another way, while Square's clients value the service provided, most of the customer base still use Square for payment processing exclusively - something any number of competitors with greater scale and pricing power can do. To be sure, since Square introduced the little white dongle, a bevy of competitors have developed their own solutions to provide simple payment processing with pricing and products that look, act and feel remarkably similar to that offered by Square.There is a reason most larger merchant acquirers have avoided the micro- and small business marketplace; there's a lot of turnover (many start-ups fail) and profitability is low. Truth be told, that's also the reason Square needs to move upmarket if it is to survive and thrive.This graphic, used in Square's Investor Conference last May, succinctly illustrates the point. While the micro market - defined here as those with under $250,000 in annual revenue - are by far the largest segment by sheer number of businesses, the potential gross sales is the smallest. Growth in this segment is already limited for Square because it already holds a large part of market share for this niche. Some rough back-of-the-napkin calculations (Total Gross Sales in Micro Market of $450 billion x the 2.75% that Square charges for processing = $11.25 billion total possible revenue) indicates that Square, with close to $2 billion in annual transaction based revenue, already serves almost 20% of that market. Then consider that most micro businesses are not ""merchants"" in the sense that they require transaction processing and the potential in the micro market universe shrinks even further. A CPA firm, for example, or house painter will simply remit an invoice and not necessarily expect on-the-spot payment for services rendered. Therefore, moving up to the Small Business Market ($250k-$1M in sales) and the Mid Market ($1M-$100M in sales) is absolutely critical for Square if it hopes to continue its growth trajectory.Why? Well to quote Willie Sutton: ""Because that's where the money is"".If money was to be made in the micro market, one would think that need would have been filled long ago. Instead, that part of the market was left to the likes of PayPal and Square who charge a larger portion of each transaction than traditional merchant acquirers - 2.75% for Square vs. .38% on average for Vantiv (VNTV), for example - as compensation for the added risk and labor intense processes inherent when dealing with small and micro merchants.Square's draw has been its simplicity - it takes mere minutes to get set up - ""on-boarded"" in the lingo of the business, and its processes are easy to use and intuitive. But while the potential is there for long-term growth and moving up-market, competition from well entrenched traditional merchant acquirers will only intensify, as these larger companies could use their size and scale to squeeze Square at the margin. In addition, marketing - which up until recently has largely been by word of mouth from one micro merchant to another, will likely start taking a bigger slice of the expense pie, along with development costs.That said, revenue should continue to grow in a range of 25-30% annually for the next several years as payment volumes increase and the trend away from cash and towards electronic transactions also continues. But while momentum is working in its favor and the brand remains strong - especially among Square's core constituents of micro business owners, the question is: Will rising revenues translate to the bottom line in the face of increasing costs associated with expanding away from that core group?Even within the micro and small merchant market, enterprises are expecting more from their payment providers as simply processing payments is starting to be considered merely the appetizer to a integrated holistic approachTo be sure, the larger merchant acquirers such as Chase (JPM), with their Paymentech services, or Bank of America Merchant Services (BAC), Vantiv and the like, will leverage their massive scale and distribution capabilities to force every bit of margin they can from the process to provide more comprehensive levels of service at lower and lower costs to the merchant.The company is scheduled to report 3rd quarter earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, November 8th. Consensus expectations are for a loss of $.05/share on $569 million in revenue. For their part, management had previously guided to earnings between -$.06/share and -$.07/share on revenue of $565 million.For the full year, the company is guiding to a loss of $.20/share on $2.15 billion in revenues, an increase of 35% YoY on RevsSQ data by YChartsSQ EPS Basic (Quarterly) data by YChartsNo argument that the company's sales and earnings metrics are trending in the right direction, and as I indicated above, I expect revenue growth to continue. However, as the company looks to expand up-market, development costs associated with such a transition could stall earnings momentum and keep valuations stretched or result in a pullback to more reasonable multiples.SQ EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsSQ PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsClearly, on both a Price to Sales basis, as well as on a charitable EV/EBITDA (forward) measure, Square is considerably overvalued. The current EV/Sales ratio of 5.4x signals that investors have already priced in significant growth in sales. Therefore, any hiccup on the execution of the company's growth strategy, especially as it relates to the top line, could cause a precipitous price decline as valuations revert back to the mean.I conclude by observing that while Square has been impressive in its performance and execution so far, the stock is priced to perfection based on both top and bottom line expectations. Risks associated with low switching costs and non-existent pricing leverage leave the company exposed to new entrant competition, while established and entrenched mid- and large market merchant acquirers will not cede market share - at least not without a significant investment in development costs by the company. Finally, should any issues with customer security arise a la Equifax (NYSE:EFX), damage to the brand could be significant.If you are considering taking a position, it may be wise to wait for a pullback or for the company to grow into its stock price through an extended period of consolidation. With shares up over 140% YTD and entering the season when many institutional managers begin to sell their winners to ""window dress"" for year-end, it may be prudent to take some profits."
4095870,98236,2017-08-07T11:29:00-04:00,"Square reported the results of its fiscal Q2 last week.The results for the quarter were another noticeable beat; management raised full year guidance as well.Investors yawned-the shares had run up into the numbers expecting a very strong quarter.Some of the sub-headline numbers, particularly the almost 100% increase in subscription and services revenues were exceptional.Company guidance for the balance of this year remains far below reasonable expectgations.","Why write another article on Square? (SQ) I have written several and the theme is the same in all of them and this one. It is and remains a quintessential momentum growth story that is seemingly getting stronger with passing quarters. I actually decided to write about Square in the wake of a Wall St. Journal article on Square which presented some misbegotten analysis to a national audience.One of the problems faced by investors is how to deal with companies whose stocks have become recognized as hyper-growth vehicles in a relatively brief period of time. I suppose to an extent that this is a problem most investors want to confront on a regular basis-but the fact is, how does one figure out what potential appreciation might remain in a stock in the wake of a sharp move. SQ presents that kind of conundrum to investors in the wake of its recently reported quarter. Just what did Square have to report in order to see the shares continue to appreciate. What is Square going to have to report going forward to drive the shares? And how likely is it that the company can continue its hyper-growth run with concomitant share price performance.Those are the major questions that the balance of this article will try to article will try to address. And just so as not to hold readers in suspense: I think the WSJ has it wrong. Square the company is more likely than not to continue to perform at levels that will support its current share valuation and to produce significant positive alpha in the years ahead. The journalist, in his article, commits the classic mistake of trying to analyze hyper-growth companies through a rearward looking lens in an attempt to make forward projections. It is a common enough fallacy-but one that journalists can readily avoid by seeking to report the news and not trying to assume the role of providing investment advice in a mass circulation newspaper.Square reported another quarter of results that surpassed expectations. Adjusted revenues for the quarter were $240 million, up 41% year on year and up by 18% sequentially. That compares to the company's prior revenue forecast of $225 million for the quarter. In Q1, adjusted revenue growth had been 39%. That is the kind of progression that analysts want to see in a hyper-growth business.The company had forecast adjusted EPS of between $0.03 and $0.05 for the quarter. Actual adjusted EPS was $0.07. Share based compensation was 133% of reported net income for the quarter, compared to 160% of reported net income in Q1 and compared to 650% of reported adjusted net income in the year earlier period. So, while stock based comp. is still high, its growth has become small, and the quality of earnings for this company has substantially improved.The company has raised its full year adjusted EPS forecast by 20%, and by less than that for the last two quarters of this current year. The company has increased its revenue forecast by about 4% from prior levels and is now forecasting 35% growth for the year as a whole. The track record of this company since it has been public and the strength in some of the sub-headline categories strongly suggest that this forecast is one disseminated as a level to be beaten and not a realistic evaluation of the company's most likely operational performance.Just looking at the construction of the numbers, the forecast seems to be unduly conservative. To reach the forecasted revenue estimate, Q4 revenue growth would have to slow from a projected 35% in Q3 to 31% in Q4. Sequentially growth in Q4 would be only 4.2%. I doubt many observers think that guidance for either this coming quarter or the full year is meant to be taken terribly seriously. It is there merely as a reference point so that it can be said to have been significantly beaten. The fact that revenue growth actually accelerated a bit in Q2 compared to Q! would seemingly suggest that the company has yet to see any real reversion to the mean in terms of growth and its ability to grow margins, while reducing the proportion of expense attributed to stock based comp in the first half of the year is clearly is a sign that the company is on a path to GAAP profitability. None of this is really reflected in the article published by the WSJ. The inferences that I have drawn from the results and from the conference call commentary suggests that the company is more likely than not to continue the pattern of quarters that beat and guidance that is a raise which has been the hallmark of SQ's financial reporting since it became public.Square is most often thought of as a company that processes payments for micro/small/mid-size-enterprises-and it does indeed do that. But at this point, and with its current scale and valuation, most investors are looking far beyond the company's payment processing business in order to develop a positive investment thesis.In the 2nd quarter, subscription and services revenue reached $59 million, just shy of one-quarter of total revenue and up by 99% year on year. Subscription and services revenues grew by a bit more than 20% sequentially from Q1 when they were 24% of the total.I have written about Square several times as I mentioned earlier in this article. I will not, therefore try to reprise much that I have written about the gamut of services that the company is offering. But while I don't want to gainsay either the centrality or the opportunity of the company's payments business, its moat these days, and more and more of its future growth, is going to come from areas outside of traditional payment processing.Last month an analyst at a brokerage called Loop Capital suggested that PayPal (PYPL) ought to buy Square. I have no idea if such a transaction has been mooted or will ever be consummated. But one of the main reasons why Square ought to be or might be of interest to PayPal would be because of the progress the company has made in building out its eco-system of ancillary services.Square continues to highlight three of its services as major drivers in the success of its non-payments business. These are Instant Deposit, Caviar and Capital. Both Capital and Instant Deposit benefit significantly from the company's use of AI. While almost all lenders, these days, have initiated some form of AI based credit investigation, I believe that Square has made this the cornerstone of its lending business. It is a huge advantage for the company in terms of expense and credit losses and it obviously is one of the attributes it sells to its 3rd party lenders who essentially fund the business. Square Capital initiated $319 million of loans last quarter from almost 50,000 borrowers. That is a striking 27% increase from the $251 million of loans initiated in Q1.No one at this point really has any idea regarding the ultimate potential of Square Capital. The business, as it is currently structured, is exceptionally lucrative. Square has exceptional insight into the financial condition of its borrowers due to the records of revenues generated by the borrowers through its credit facility. It has what is said to be an advanced data sciences operation to develop appropriate criteria for sizing and granting loans. I believe that when readers/investors evaluate competitive moats, this is one that is under-appreciated. Square can grant loans more quickly and can do so with lower risk than would be the case without significant advantages due to its long history of using AI (algorithms) in order to facilitate its business. And it sells loans to 3rd party capital sources who would otherwise have no access to the kind of returns and liquidity of the product offered to them by Square.Perhaps, in time, other payment processing services will develop a facility comparable to that of Square. At this point, Shopify (SHOP) has begun to offer the same kind of credit facility that is offered by Square. Shopify has a payment service that it offers to the merchants who build their store on its infrastructure and who use its Shopify Pay service. At this point, however, its Capital business is in its infancy with $37 million of merchant cash advances last quarter, up almost 100% sequentially but just a bit more than 10% of the loans advanced by Square in the same period.One of the reasons why I think the Wall St. Journal analysis is ill-informed is simply the lack of commentary in the article regarding this area of Square's business.In additional to Capital, the company offers a service called instant deposit. It is sometimes difficult for observers such as this writer to appreciate the capital requirements of operating relatively smaller businesses and of being perpetually ill-funded and under-capitalized. Square doesn't really quantify the magnitude of its instant deposit business-other than to say it is one of the factors in growing its non-payment processing revenues. I think it is fair to say that the revenues generated by this service are exceptionally profitable as Square charges merchants a 1% discount on the total revenue they generate using this program to make funds available instantly as opposed to overnight. Clearly, the APR of the advances made through this program is enormous and the losses on these transactions have been exceptionally low.Again, I do not believe anyone has a real perspective on the ultimate potential of this program. It is a part of Square that is not well recognized or valued, I imagine. But it is clearly one factor that investors are likely to highly value and over time, the growth of Capital and Instant Deposit seem likely to change the business model substantially to a far more profitable plane than has heretofore been the case.This past quarter, Square initiated a program called Square Installments which allows its sellers to offer their customers installment payments on purchases. It is still in the trial mode but it certainly might become a major opportunity for Square and its sellers. Almost no seller of the size that is typical of the Square customer base can offer their own installment payment program-they typically go to banks who may not be easy to work with and frequently require individual decisions on credit applications. For the most part, the ultimate buyers looking for an installment payment option fall back on their own credit resources-which may be non-existent or undesirable to buyers.Just what the potential of the program might be and what its economics can be is unknown and undisclosed at this point. But I think most readers can appreciate the possible significance of such a program for Square as it affords Square sellers access to a facility they cannot find elsewhere and motivates them to become Square customers in the first place.The installment business, if it becomes mainstream for Square will rely heavily on the company's deep learning/AI capabilities which will give it the potential to scale. I think it is likely to prove to be that this becomes a significant revenue generator for Square and a major tool in its ability to sell merchants-and particularly larger sized merchants who sell more expensive products with larger average transaction sizes.The third major non-payment processing source of revenue for this company at this time is its restaurant delivery business, Caviar. Again, the specific numbers are unknown and at one point the business was said to be for sale due to unprofitability. Caviar was unmentioned during the last conference call so investors have no particular knowledge about its growth during the past quarter.Caviar doesn't seem like it would be something offered by a company that is focused on using technology to offer differentiated solutions to smaller merchants. Delivering restaurant meals seems to be a pretty mundane undertaking. Of course, so did ride-hailing before Uber and Lyft disrupted the taxi business-and indeed, delivering restaurant meals does have some of the technology that is used by ride hailing services.In any event, Caviar is a service for restaurants that is a bit more sophisticated than just delivering meals. Obviously, the service can include payments and Capital which is part of what makes it particularly attractive for Square. But it often includes Square's flavor (no pun intended) of CRM and the Square's payroll and invoice offerings. Basically, when investors look at Caviar, they can see a blue print for how Square wants to evolve going forward. The payment processing is a hook from which to dangle all of the other services and to prevent price erosion from attenuating the company's margins.This last quarter, the management made a point of calling out its CRM offering as something of significant value to users and one service that is gaining traction. To an extent, what Square is able to do as it processes payments, is to build a database of customers and determine what they have purchased and to provide users with the ability to launch campaigns to a targeted audience. The company CEO called out the success of the company's CRM tool and maintains that it generates more than $10 sales per every dollar of spend. Not too sure as to the basis of the calculation-and of course the more appropriate metric to consider would be additions to gross margin-but the CRM service is something that can drive revenues and build a better competitive moat than processing credit cards.Given that Square's foundation is that of processing payments, one thing it generates a great deal of are numbers. Some of these numbers are more important than others. For readers unfamiliar with this company, the top line number at which to look is adjusted revenue which excludes the interchange fees the company passes through to its sellers. Of some significance in terms of looking at Square's future is that revenues from the company's mid-market cohort of sellers grew by 61% last quarter. While the company continues to sell its basic service to micro merchants, its focus has shifted to larger sellers who can afford to buy and receive more value from additional Square services.Overall, the company has maintained a margin of a bit over 1% on its gross payment volume and that metric has remained stable for several quarters. This is a function of the willingness of larger sellers to use more of SQ's non-credit card services. The company is seeing a strong uptake in services such as invoices, Virtual Terminal and e-commerce API fees which have significantly higher rates than the fees collected through credit card swipes and these services are preponderantly used by larger sellers.I typically look at operating costs on a GAAP basis which is a more accurate assessment of actual spending. The company spent no less than 32% of its adjusted revenues on research and development last quarter-and while that metric is far higher than is sustainable long-term, it is lower than the 40% spend on research and development the year-earlier period. Sales and marketing spend increased from 23% to 25% of revenue year on year. The company is likely to sustain a rather significant cost as it enters the UK market and this cost will be front-end loaded compared to revenues. In addition, as the company is selling more software, in particular, it will inevitably see higher sales and marketing costs. Square has a long way to go in terms of building out its sales and marketing infrastructure even in this country-it does not open its telesales operation until 9AM on the east coast, for example-and it has even further to go in terms of its potential geographical expansion.General and administrative costs fell from a 30% of revenues to a bit over 26% of revenues. Overall, the improvement in operating expense ratios reached 1000 basis points last quarter, greater than company guidance had been for that metric. During the conference call, management suggested that the last two quarters of the year would not see the same cadence of improvements as was experienced last quarter. I really wonder if that will happen, given the track record of the company in terms of forecasting operating expenses. I think it is more likely that the trends of the first 6 months will continue through the balance of the year, which is one reason to anticipate that reported earnings will surpass estimates as has been the pattern for this company.As mentioned earlier, stock based compensation has declined noticeably as a percentage of revenue although it is still increasing in absolute terms. That being said, stock based compensation rose 22% sequentially last quarter, compared to the 18% sequential increase in revenues. Looked at holistically, one might reasonably expect the company to achieve positive GAAP profitability next year at some point.At this point, the company is cash-flow positive and generated $90 million of CFFO from operations in the first half of the year compared to a cash burn of $32 million the prior year. CFFO increase a bit sequentially but given there is no real record of positive CFFO, it is hard to evaluate what might be normal seasonality. Some of the components of cash flow are related to the operations of Square Capital. While some observers choose to look at provisions in evaluating loan losses, actual charge-offs were at extremely low levels and their ratio has declined year on year, while rising sequentially at a modest rate.Square does not forecast CFFO although it does forecast EBITDA which is a closely related metric. The company reported adjusted EBITDA of $63 million in the first half of the year, and $36 million for that metric last quarter. It has forecast that adjusted EBITDA will be in the range of $120 million to $128 million for the full year. On the call in the wake of one analyst expressing disbelief in the forecast, management simply said that the forecast for adjusted EBITDA for the full year was planned to exceed projections. It seems quite unlikely that adjusted EBITDA will not increase noticeably for this company in the second half of this year, particularly as it benefits from significant Q4 seasonality.I suppose that some readers may think this is the long way around in terms of dealing with the Wall St. Journal stock analysis that essentially suggested that Square is a better company than it is an investment.Currently, Square has a market cap of $9.5 billion based on 377 million outstanding shares. The company's enterprise value is about $8.9 billion. That yields an EV/S of about 8.2X based on my forward projection of revenue over the next 4 quarters. I think that the percentage revenue growth forecast carried by First Call is really not a meaningful expectation for the kind of growth expected for this company at this time.How much will the company be able to earn over the next 12 months on a non-GAAP basis? Estimates range broadly to the point where using a consensus forecast is not terribly useful. And the fact is that the projection of earnings for next year has shown extreme volatility-one quarter ago estimates forecast a loss of $0.06 for the following 12 months and now the consensus First Call forecast from 18 analysts has reached $.38 with a high forecast of $.58.The company is forecasting an adjusted EBITDA margin this year of 13%. Is it reasonable to assume that the margin that could be achieved next year would show an additional 700-900 basis point increase? The problem with this kind of analysis is that it relates to specific choices that the company will make and which are not readily visible to outsiders at this point. If the company did achieve a 20% EBITDA margin over the next 12 months, and if outstanding shares for next 12 months average 385 million, then reported EPS ought to be about $0.45 for the period. The only significant difference between EBITDA and reported non-GAAP income are depreciation, interest and the addback of the debt discount amortization. No one buying the shares at current levels is doing so because of current earnings. They are doing so based on the company's strategy and its ability to execute.As mentioned, the company is cashflow positive and should remain so for the foreseeable future. Cash flow is exceeding adjusted EBITDA because of balance sheet items, for the most part. These balance sheet items include the expense of customer charge-offs which has been very modest. I think it is reasonable to believe that the relationship between adjusted EBITDA and CFFO will remain about the same over time. That suggests using a CFFO estimate of $240 million for the next 12 months. Capex will probably be about $30 million over the coming year and that yields a free cash flow estimate of $210 million. That is a free cash flow yield of 2.5%. Again, no investors are buying these shares based on their current financial metrics.Should investors buy these shares. I am holding a significant position which is probably as good an answer as any. I think the strong growth-above 30% and faster will continue for several years. I think the company has built an under-appreciated business moat based on Capital and Caviar and that the moat will widen and deepen as the Square platform and newer services gain user acceptance. While the payment business is probably not super-exciting long-term, the lending business and the installment business are both exceptionally promising and are being built on unique technology that provides Square with market advantages, cost advantages and advantages with regards to loan losses that are hard to match.Will Square get bought by PayPal or anyone else. I have no way of knowing something like that. Square is more of a technology vendor than a payments vendor-that, at any rate, is my thesis. As a technology vendor it could attract a broad spectrum of potential acquisitors. There is certainly some level of consolidation to be seen in the fintech market at this point-but speculating that Square will be bought is just that-speculation.I obviously do not anticipate that Square shares are going to double again in the coming 7 months as they have done in the past 7 months. They may, in fact stagnate. But I like their outlook in terms of producing positive alpha for the longer term."
4088423,103450,2017-07-18T12:16:09-04:00,"Square's revenue is growing at an incredibly fast rate at has only just begun to plateau.Square Capital will bring in an entirely new market for them to grow into.The growth of Square, Inc's Cost of Revenue is slowing down significantly.","Square, Inc (NYSE: SQ) is a growing competitor in the consumer finance market that will break out due primarily to its lucratively growing business model. Moreover, Square Capital will allow the company to enter into a brand new market, thus adding another revenue stream. SQ operates as a ""cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run, and grow their businesses"" via a myriad of powerful programs and devices for payments and point of sale solutions. Unlike a vast majority of other solutions in the industry, SQ allows sellers to utilize a single, centralized system instead of resorting to the patchwork-style of cobbling multiple systems together to get things running.The first thing to look at is how much money they've been generating, both recently and historically. This information can be found at here on marketwatch.The table above is a small glance into Square's income statements for the past five years.Let's break it down a bit from the top.Starting at its annual revenue, we can see that Square has experienced tremendous growth over the years since its initial public inception. From its revenue in 2012 of $203.45M, Square has grown to a revenue generating titan of $1.71B!That's a growth of roughly 800% over the course of five short years.In 2013, revenue shot up a massive 171.53% to $552M, 53.90% to $850M in 2014, 49.04% to 1.27B in 2015, and 34.85% to $1.7B in 2016. Now, it's clear that the growth rate year-over-year has been on a steady decline. However, the numbers aren't particularly harrowing and fall well within the realm of expectation.In fact if you take the rate that the growth is slowing down at, you can see clearly that it's beginning to find some sort of ground where it is now. The period from 2013 to 2014 had a growth drop of nearly 70% from 171.53% to 53.90%, but the subsequent period only brought a drop of 10%. The final period of 2015 to 2016 had a minor uptick to 30% but it's pertinent to see how revenue growth looks for the coming 2017 fiscal year before making any rash comments. And while a declining sales growth percentage may not be the best of news nor the worst of news, a declining growth rate on the liabilities that SQ generates is a great sign.The Cost of Revenue is where SQ has historically lost most of it's revenue year-after-year. In 2012, the CoR was 68% of total revenue, and it shot up 8% to 76% of total revenue in 2013. However since then it's been steadily dropping, down 74%, 72%, and finally now resting at 66% of total revenue. A value lower than that of its 2012 initial value. On top of this, the rate at which the CoR is growing at is slowing down as well.During the 2015 to the 2016 fiscal year, CoR grew roughly 25% and while that may seem staggering at first, one must first keep in mind that:So not only did the growth rate decline, but it also declined to a rate smaller than that of the revenue's.While it certainly is nice to know that the general gist of the SQ's income is looking positive; revenue is growing faster than the cost of revenue and SG&A expenses, it is still important to know just how that translates onto their cash flow statement.Here's their cash flow statement from the same time frame of 2012 to 2016.For the past five years, SQ has indeed been running deep in the red, no question about it. In fact, up until 2015, the FCF was declining at a tremendous rate. From 2012 to 2014, the FCF sank from -55.96M to -138.19M. A drop of 246% within that time frame. However, as bad as it looked, the FCF turned around nearly instantly the next immediate year.From 2014 to 2015, SQ was able to come back from the crater it had dug, rising to -9.85M within that short time frame (92.87% change). In the most recent period of 2016, SQ grew another staggering 76.62% and drew just a couple million shy of breaking even. While it is certainly true that the number is still negative, having closed the gap and drawn so close to the black is an incredible feat in and of itself.With revenue still growing and the liabilities on the fall, a positive cash flow is looking to be their next big milestone.Now a little over two and a half years old and many people can see the value of Square Capital; SQ's lending arm. By pulling up their 2016 annual earnings report and finding their Results of Operations we can see just what sort of impact Square Capital is having. Transaction-Based Revenue (TBR) is the revenue SQ generates from the fees they collect from their managed payments services. SQ's TBR is where most of their revenue is currently generated and has been growing at a healthy rate. In fact, TBR alone generated 85% of SQ's revenue in the 2016 fiscal year. The Starbucks Transaction-Based Revenue is a similar revenue system to the general TBR, but is focused solely from the Starbucks company. SQ and Starbucks struck a deal to work together back in 2012, but that deal came to a close by the end of 2016. Luckily, the revenue stream generated a very meager amount, barely amounting to 7.5% of total revenue in the 2016 year. Hardware Revenue is effectively their physical products such as the Square Stand and the Square Card Reader. While growing naturally due to SQ's own growth as a company, the Hardware Revenue has historically amounted to very little. Its 2016 impact was a meager 2.5%. Subscription and Services-Based Revenue (SSBR) is the true focus. It is defined by SQ as the ""revenue related to services provided through software offerings or deriving from the use of underlying data."" The main generators of revenue are, in order, ""Square Capital, Caviar, and other software as a service."" Square Capital, at the moment, is the largest driver of revenue among those three as stated by SQ itself in their 2016 annual report.But what is making Square Capital such a fast growing stream of revenue? Well according the SQ, the company is in a unique position to become a lender to its sellers due to the data SQ collects on a daily basis from them. They are able to use this data to better determine which companies are more eligible for loans. Then, once a loan is made, Square then sells a majority of those loans to third parties. Those third party buyers must first pay an upfront fee and then an ongoing servicing free. SQ recently put out its first earnings report for the 2017 fiscal year and the initial fear that the lending arm would slow down has been recently dashed aside. Square Capital grew nearly 64% YoY to $251 million, a massive shot upwards already.While there are plenty of pitfalls within the lending industry, primarily coming from competitors such as American Express, I still firmly believe that the market is ripe for Square to take hold and grow.Square, Inc will become profitable sooner rather than later.Perhaps it won't be today or tomorrow. It may not be within the next quarter, even.But within the close future, this company will easily enter the black and remain there as a top level competitor in the POS market and small-business lending market. While they are a bit highly priced right now and I do expect a pullback of some sort within the year, I believe that the possible upside still outweighs the possible downside. I am tentative to give out a price target of any sort at the current moment, but if I had to give a range...I'd say this could dip to $20 somewhere soon and end up being roughly $30 by the end of the year."

MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA), Visa (NYSE: V), and PayPal Holding, Inc. (NasdaqGS: PYPL) were chosen because those companies operate in the same industry and service sector as Square. While they may not be direct competitors, they experience similar effects from economic changes. It is these changes that allow for the strength of this model.MasterCard Incorporated, Visa, and PayPal Holding, Inc. aggregate share value is represented in the above graph as the time series titled “Transaction Index.” The Transaction Index is divided by ten in order to frame in better with in the graph.After regressing this data from all 4 firms, the results are convincing. The model carries a significance F value of 9.2^-168, which means there is an effective 100% likelihood that MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal can be accurately used to model what the price of Square’s stock should be.The model currently shows Square is slightly overvalued, by about $0.90 per share, or 3.9%.This style of hedonic regression, concentrates on analyzing the evaluation of Square’s stock within the confines of the financial transaction industry, but what if the regression was expanded to more macro-financial indicators?Modeling Square’s stock price against the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices reveals the same results of the industry specific regression, Square is currently overvalued, though this model is more aggressive in its conclusory data, it suggests a sell position is more proper than a hold.Though the results of this modeling approach should stand to only reinforce the conclusion of the previous industry specific model, not usurp it. This is because there are far broader economic winds that push the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices than guide the financial transaction sector; while, the indices model carries the same weight of significance that the industry specific model, in totality the industry specific model is many orders of magnitudes greater in accuracy.When both analytical approaches are taken into account, an interesting picture is paintedDiving into the inner working of how this data translates to an actionable trading move show that holding the asset is wise. Projecting forward, the sensitivity of Square’s share price suggests that there is a distinct and present likelihood of valuation stabilization in the next couple of quarters. It is after this stabilization that a more long term decision can be made.These two models condense a few significant conclusions.The first and most vocal is that Square is overvalued compared to its equilibrium. When referencing a stock’s equilibrium, this is referring to the inherent position of where the supply of the stock matches the demand for the stock. This is an important relationship because it helps convey, in the short run, what is the appropriate stance to take on the stock.It is also important to take into to account the duration of past imbalances, historically Square’s shares return to equilibrium in the matter of a few weeks. This is the reason a hold position is preferred over a sell position. While Square’s shares are currently being shown to be overvalued, the nature of the value to quickly correct means the risk exposure to holding is far smaller than the potential reward for holding.Furthermore, with the increasing prowess of FinTech companies and Square’s propensity for innovation, an investor ridding themselves of a company that has a proven track record of seeing what is beyond the horizon would not be wise. A reduction in portfolio may be appropriate for the risk adverse investor, but a forced exodus of Square’s shares from a portfolio is not supported by these data analyses.A prime example of the rise of FinTech and the future demand that will be experienced by companies like Square, MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal can be seen in card based transactions becoming the most common form of payment in Britain last year. As economies transition away from physical monetary exchanges, firms across the economy will have to adapt. Recently, Visa announced an incentive plan to push for cashless transaction in restaurants. Square offers the first entry point, both in price and ease of use, for many small operations. This advantage of being easy to set-up and use is a substantial advantage of more traditional processing ports like VeriFone Systems Inc (NYSE: PAY). These reasons advance the vindication that Square should be held, despite being currently overvalued.As economies consider their march to cashless transaction, there is also the threat of new competition entering the market. So while Square may have the market share advantage and the clear ability to flex to the needs of the end user, investors should consider how Square adapts to the future demand on electronic transactions. If Square continues to innovate, there are strong reasons to expect them to grow their market share, but if Square can no longer maintain its ability to attract budding businesses to use their products and services this may prove to erode some market share.While this modelling is great for short-run valuation analysis, it merely conveys, with significant econometrical backing, that Square is currently overvalued; selling over its equilibrium point. In the long run, there is good reason to believe that any company on the transaction processing chain should expect growth that will outpace natural asset inflation.The industry specific model strongly suggests to hold Square and the macro-indicators support this approach. The future growth of non-cash transactions further advance the idea that while Square may not be priced properly to buy now, current holders should still expect continued long term return."

(NYSE:SQ) recently blew away first quarter expectations reporting 22% YOY revenue growth (39% YOY adjusted revenue growth), 33% YOY GPV growth, and a -$0.04 loss per share relative to expectations of -$0.08. As a result, shares have rallied over 50% during 2017 but I believe the company has significant opportunities for growth.Source: Square First Quarter 2017 Shareholder LetterBusiness Overview - Products and ServicesThe picture below provides a snapshot of Square's business.Source: Square Investor Day 2017 PresentationManaged Payments Solutions - The core of Square's business is a full service, managed payments offering. Square's services allow sellers to manage the entire payment lifecycle including reporting, analytics, next-day settlements (instant settlement, aka Instant Deposit, is available for an additional transaction fee), digital receipts, payment dispute management, chargeback protection, and PCI compliance.In-Person/Card-Present Payments - For in-person payments, Square provides hardware that can process all card payment forms for a transaction fee paid by the seller. Online Payments/Card Not Present Payments - Square allows sellers to accept online payments. For card not present payments, card information can be entered manually. Square Cash - Square Cash is an app that allows a user to send and receive money, i.e. Venmo. Square Point of Sale - Square Point of Sale is a point of sale software that can be easily downloaded to an iOS or Android device. The service also includes Square Dashboard, which is a cloud-based reporting and analytics tool. For these services Square charges either a transaction fee, a subscription fee, or a service fee. Square continues to innovate and add features to Square Point of Sale that are tailored around specific industries. Additionally, Square for Retail was recently launched which is a point of sale service made specifically for retailers. Some of the features include inventory management that supports tens of thousands of items, employee management, and analytics that allow sellers to understand customer behavior.Developer Platform - Square's developer platform, Build with Square, grants sellers flexibility to meet their individual business needs. Build with Square consists of various APIs for customized solutions.Square Capital - Square Capital facilitates loans to pre-qualified sellers. Square simplifies the lengthy and burdensome traditional loan application process for sellers. The loan terms are straightforward and once approved, sellers receive funds quickly, often times the next day. Sellers typically use loaned funds for business investments such as buying inventory or equipment, hiring employees, store expansion, etc. Square Capital launched in May 2014 and as of year end 2016 facilitated over 200,000 loans and merchant cash advances totaling $1.3 billion.Caviar - Square markets Caviar to restaurants to easily set up a food delivery platform. They are expanding the platform from a food delivery service to more of a food ordering platform and I expect this shift was driven by competition from similar well-established providers.User Base (Sellers)Square's sellers span across a wide range of industries. These sellers range from single vendor boutiques to multi-location businesses. Sellers also span across several regions including the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, and the U.K. with plans to further expand internationally. This diversity indicates Square's offerings are applicable across industries, business sizes, and geographies.Square InvoicesSquare Invoices was integrated with the Square app (previously accessible via Square Dashboard in a web browser) in November 2016 and saw robust growth during the first quarter of 2017. This enhanced functionality resonated positively with sellers. Square added more Invoices sellers in the first quarter than any other quarter which drove approximately $700 million additional GPV for the quarter.Source: Square First Quarter Shareholder LetterIncreasing Customer SizeThe chart below indicates Square has increased its percentage of higher GPV sellers since the first quarter of 2013. Sellers with >$500k GPV have increased from 4% to 15% from the first quarter 2013 to first quarter 2017 period. Square has increased its focus on larger sellers which aside from increasing GPV, these businesses are likely to use additional Square services such as invoicing, instant deposit, and Square Capital.Source: Square Investor Day 2017 PresentationHigh NPSSquare has strong brand appreciation. Square has had an average Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 70 over the past four quarters, which is roughly double the average score for banking providers. A high NPS indicates sellers are recommending Square's services to others, whereby Square benefits from efficient customer acquisition.International GrowthSquare has significant room for expansion in international markets. The markets they have entered include the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, and the U.K. To prove concept, Square tested its technology in Australia. Australia is an interesting market as it has over two million small business and +70% of transactions are contactless. As shown by the chart below, they have had a very successful adoption of their product in Australia since March 2016.Source: Square Investor Day 2017 PresentationAfter Australia, the next step was to take their product to the U.K. Square recently launched in the U.K. this past March. The U.K. is an attractive market because there are +5.5 million small businesses that represent 47% of private sector revenue. Many of these small businesses do not accept credit cards making it an attractive market for Square's business model. Additionally, the U.K. represents a doorway to future international expansion.Source: Square Investor Day 2017 PresentationLong Term Growth TargetsSquare realized 64% adjusted revenue growth in 2015 and 52% in 2016 while providing 2017 guidance for 31% revenue growth. Their long-term targets for revenue growth are approximately 20-25%. As a reminder, Square shows adjusted revenue to remove distortions from their prior relationship with Starbucks. Realized adjusted EBITDA margins for 2016 were 7% while they provided 2017 guidance of 13%. Over the long-term they are expecting 35-40% EBITDA margins which is significantly above current levels.DCF Analysis - Perpetuity Growth MethodA discounted cash flow analysis using the perpetuity growth method indicates shares at the time of this writing were trading at a discount. Square was trading at $23.57 per share and the DCF estimated value per share is $27.57, implying 17% upside.Source: BloombergConclusionDespite trading near all-time highs, I believe Square remains an attractive growth candidate to hold over the long-term. Most notably, the company is focusing on larger retailers with higher GPVs as well as international expansion. The recent first quarter results indicated the company is moving in the right direction. As the business continues to grow, it will benefit from greater stability and revenue predictability. Additionally, Square is able to leverage its existing user base by driving product adoption through integration. This was demonstrated by Square Invoices growing significantly after it was integrated within the Square app. Square continues to remain competitive against its peers, mainly PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Here and Shopify POS. As indicated by iOS app store business application rankings, Square remains ahead of PayPal."
4085347,103060,2017-07-02T22:34:27-04:00,Western and Asian nations have begun further moving away from cash transactions.Millennials are expectedly at the fore front of this sizable shift.Square has established itself as a leader in enabling and hastening this process by allowing traditionally cash based small businesses a full digital alternative.,"Square (NASDAQ: SQ) has now operated for over six years, having been founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey (CEO) and Jim McKelvey (Director), and has established itself as one of the more readily identifiable brands in the fintech world. A sector that has been expanding at a torrid pace as more and more payments are being processed digitally. Projections have 90% of smartphone users making a mobile payment by 2020.Below is an abbreviated timeline of how quickly the digital payment space is evolving, courtesy of the same tech crunch article linked in the previous statistic:Fintech is on pace to surpass $1 trillion Gross Payment Volume (GPV) in 2017 in the US alone with similar figures in China according to statista. A CAGR of 18% through 2021 is projected.Cash remains the biggest (and most stubborn) hurdle to overcome; as of 2016 22% of consumers in the US still used it in half of their purchases versus 20% five years earlier. This is somewhat countered with cash only use having declined to 10% from 19% in that same timeframe.Another informative graphic is a comparison of cash-in-circulation as a percentage of GDP in the U.S., U.K., Sweden, and the eurozone, 2010–2014:Cash is still rising in circulation in the US although at a slower pace. As many may already be aware, Sweden (along with other Nordic nations) is trying to lead the way globally into becoming a cashless society, these figures support that trend; with the UK now exhibiting a flat projection, it too could join in the negative growth rates of cash availability.The various figures and data above serve to demonstrate the ripe business sector Square finds itself in. We can now turn to what the company itself has on offer, starting off with the very people at the helm.In every investment opportunity, I seek a strong and reliable management team. This is an unquantifiable metric of invaluable quality and one which is stressed in nearly all of my articles. Square has thus far successfully navigated a complex, increasingly evolving industry full of impressive and intimidating competitors. Members of the company’s leadership have held prior senior positions at names such as Salesforce (NASDAQ: CRM), Visa (NASDAQ: V), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). It’s a group that undeniably helps make possible the vision that Jack Dorsey has for the brand and one that is creating added value by the day.Square is best known for its white square payment dongle that attaches to a smartphone or tablet via the audio jack. Yet, it has successfully diversified itself into many other payment related offerings (as well as a delivery service) while remaining a point of sale (POS) centric company ($1.5B of $1.7B total 2016 revenues was transaction based). Square processed nearly $50B in Gross Payment Volume (GPV) in 2016, up 39% from 2015’s total and 108% over 2014’s.These alternative avenues of growth include the Square Capital service, which offers loans to sellers based on their payment processing history; Build with Square developer platform (APIs) which allows businesses to customize their business solutions while utilizing services provided in the Square ecosystem; Appointments and Square Inventory; and finally Caviar, the aforementioned delivery service which the company describes as “a food ordering service that helps restaurants reach new customers and increase sales without additional overhead.”There has been much attention as of late on SQ (the ticker has broken out into all-time highs and with good reason) as evident in the nearly weekly Seeking Alpha articles. The coverage has been overall detailed but I have a belief that it has been greatly undervalued in its mid-term (6-12 month) potential. We’ll start from the top in laying out the case for a drastically higher valuation for this very much still nascent name.What has really struck me is the ability for Square to continue capturing larger income driving businesses quarter over quarter. Below is a chart that displays this trend in GPV: through EOY 2016.In the Q1 2017 earnings report, the company highlighted that this movement to larger grossing clients has not slowed, “Larger sellers, which are those that generate more than $125,000 in annualized GPV. In the first quarter of 2017, GPV from larger sellers grew 44% year over year and accounted for 43% [vs. the 42% in Q4 16 above] of total GPV, up from 39% of total GPV in the first quarter of 2016.”This is a measure that offers more than just numbers and dollar figures. It indicates that business owners with larger responsibilities and risks trust the Square brand to deliver for them day in and day out. This shift will only further solidify revenue growth as it originates more and more from stable sellers who can be inferred to have more substantial customer bases. This dynamic can already be seen playing out in the figure below; customers that chose Square’s payments platform in 2015 grew rapidly in the following year, same for those in 2014.These new clients growth has positively impacted Square’s bottom line. Net Income as of late has been basing just below the watermark, building up to breaking even in the pending quarters. It is worth noting that EBITDA has been just a penny shy of break-even for the last two quarters (management has preferred to concentrate on an adjusted EBITDA which removes its Starbucks losses and shows results in the black instead).The company mutually split from its agreement with Starbucks. According to its S-1 filing, Square revealed that in 2012, it received $9.47 million in revenue from Starbucks, with the amount increasing to $114.45 million a year later and $123 million in 2014. But if you looked at the transaction costs, it’s was a very telling story: Square paid $12.54 million in fees in 2012, $139.8 million in 2013, and $150.96 million in 2014 (net losses for all three).For Q1 2017, Square did $33 million in revenue generated through this Starbucks deal with a marginal profit of $4 million. This showed improvement from the prior year that featured $34 million in revenue and a loss of $7 million, but may have been too late. In the end, the relationship turned out to be more of a marketing gimmick for Square to get its name out nationally and attract the attention of business owners who may have frequented the coffee chain themselves (arguably successful in that regard).Square Invoices has shown solid quarterly adoption, jumping 65% this Q1 to $699m ($423m Q1 2016) in revenues due to mobile integration (50% of invoices are now sent on a mobile device vs. 34% this past October). This gives great flexibility for clients to charge their customers either in person or online using whichever peripheral is most convenient for them. Square Capital is another revenue driver growing at very high double-digit percentage rates (64% in this case), facilitating $251m in business loans for Q1 2017 vs. $153m LY. Both Invoices and Capital far outpace the adjusted (excludes Starbucks) 36% revenue growth YoY for Q1 let alone the non-adjusted 22%.Considering all of these positive tailwinds, there still lurks the very real chance for turbulence. The biggest future risk to Square is simply being bypassed or becoming obsolete as the payment processing sector is undergoing rapid tectonic (a scary oxymoron to conjure) shifts as both businesses and consumers try to find their way into a 21st century equilibrium. As outlined earlier, the methods and forms of payment at POS terminals are shifting. Although contactless, or NFC, transactions have not caught on, what has caught on is peer-to-peer app transactions. Venmo has become so ubiquitous that its very name is now casually used in the form of a verb when referencing a payment amongst individuals (it helps that it processed $6.8B in Q1, doubling LY).For instance, in a 2016 survey conducted by Accenture it was found that 32% of millennials and 27% of mass affluents use their mobile phones for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, compared to an 18% average.This same survey also provided a clue as to why NFC payments haven’t become mainstream: people are simply content with using a card to meet their needs, “Just 19 percent of consumers pay in store with their phones like last year. Those who have yet to (37 percent) point to a simple reason why. Cash and plastic cards meet their needs.”Should this type of contactless transaction (already being pushed by the bigger financial giants in the form of Zelle) become a possibility for the consumer-to-business variety, and Square is NOT part of that picture, it could mean an eventual steady decline in revenues. Compounding this risk becoming a reality is the ever expanding use of cryptocurrencies. How would Square survive in a future where blockchain becomes the standard digital payment? This is a very possible (relatively near term) future but I have full confidence that this management team will do what is necessary to not be left in the dust; as it has demonstrated in its quick and seamless entry into EMV based payments (12% of card swipes in January 2015 vs. 53% in December 2015) along with astutely identifying the opportunity to seamlessly provide financing to burgeoning businesses.The company is relatively healthy in terms of its cash situation and more notably improving. At the conclusion of the first quarter of 2017, it had $740M on hand vs. $391M in Q1 2016 and $488M at the end of Q4 2016. It was able to issue $428M in convertible notes and $57M in warrants in the previous quarter which puts it in a position to carry on operations without fear of insolvency for the foreseeable future. The only reason a sizeable increase in outstanding shares could be a reasonable possibility would be to fund a sizeable acquisition; as the path to profitability is all but secure from here forth. There were 145m shares as of March 31st, 2015, compared to 356m March 31st, 2017. That pace cannot go on in the interest of devoted investors and with recent annual net incomes of -$171m, the $740m stockpile should finally see the share count stabilize.I am encouraged to see that the often small business associated brand is making continual gains with mid-sized businesses. This not only offers better revenue security in the coming years, but also provides a lucrative channel for sizeable growth with more efficient costs of entry. The other growth driver, which remarkably remains to this day all but untapped (less than 5% of total revenues), is the international market. At the moment Square operates in Canada, Japan, Australia, and as of the past quarter in the United Kingdom (the world’s 5th largest economy). The UK offers a sizeable market for a fintech company targeting small and medium sized business, 70% of shoppers in the country prefer to pay by credit card but more than half of these businesses do not offer this form of payment. International revenue increased 37.2% from $12.1M Q1 16 to $16.6M Q1 17.‘What is Square worth?’ you might be asking at this point. From my perspective, there is no reason it cannot attain the levels of which PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has ascended.Thanks to Venmo, among other factors, PayPal has been able to grow even at this more mature stage in its history at an average rate of 17% YoY for the last three quarters. Hauling in revenues of nearly $3 billion per quarter and sporting a market cap of $63B (vs. Square’s $8.45B). It may be several years before we see such a valuation for Square, but it is within its reach with the proper execution.Although the payment landscape is shifting day by day, Square has found a way to remain relevant and has many more gains ahead of it. Confidence continues in the management’s ability to meet future challenges in the space. As society ever so steadily weans off of cash based transactions, Square stands to profit. The one issue, particularly as a potential investor today that needs to be better enforced going forward, is to see the dilution spigot turned off."
4075734,102634,2017-05-23T13:15:35-04:00,Square should continue to gain market share.Improving technology should attract more large sellers.Stock price has more upside.,"One stock that might be an intriguing pick for investors right now is Square (NYSE:SQ). This is because the company just reported its first-quarter earnings that blew past expectations. In 2017, the stock has been a strong performer, rising over 50%. What is so special about this company? Can the growth continue for the foreseeable future? I will take a closer look at the first-quarter earnings and determine if there is more upside.First-Quarter EarningsThe market seemed to love the company's earnings results reported on May 4 with the stock price closing at $19.90. For the first quarter, Square reported a 22% increase in revenue, hitting $462 million. Transaction-based revenue, which makes up about 87% of the company's total, came in higher than expected at $403 million. Subscription and services-based revenue was $49 million, up 106% year over year. Net loss reached $15 million, an improvement of $82 million from the first quarter of 2016. Gross payment volume (GPV) grew to $13.6 billion, which represents an increase of 33% year over year. Square ended the quarter with $990 million in cash, up from $576 million in 2016.Management AnalysisAt the beginning of the conference call, CEO Jack Dorsey spoke on Square having a great start to the year. The company entered its fourth international market with a new launch in UK. The launch included new technology that enabled Square to accept payments that use PINs to authenticate chip card transactions. Meanwhile, management provided an update on its food delivery service Caviar. The service now includes a pickup option with Q1 orders more than doubling year over year. Dorsey sees Caviar as being an important part of Square's ability to reach full service restaurant and provide businesses with new solutions.The revenue growth from subscription and services was a big factor in Square beating market expectations. CFO Sarah Friar pointed out that Square Capital grew 64% year over year and facilitated over 40,000 business loans totaling $251 million. ""The core part of our strategy with capital is to sell those loans on to third-party investors. That helps us to continue to fuel our growth and also help manage our risk at the same time"" said Friar. A second contributor to subscription and services was Instant Deposits. The feature allows merchants and P2P users to receive deposits up to $2,500 paying a 1 percent fee to Square. Overall, the company has seen strong demand for Instant Deposits and predicts it will continue to have a positive effect on gross margin of software and services.In the first quarter of 2017, GPV grew significantly to $13.6 billion. Square managed to see increased activity from larger sellers, which are those that generate more than $125,000 in annualized GPV. For the quarter, GPV from larger sellers grew 44% year over year and accounted for 43% of total GPV, up from 39% of total GPV in Q1 2016. As Friar explained:As Square expands its services into more international markets, I see the GPV increasing further. For example, in UK, only half of the country's small businesses accept credit cards. This is a big opportunity because 70% of shoppers in the UK prefer to use credit cards for purchases. With the current profit margin for payments at 1.07%, I see no reason why the percentage wouldn't hit 2% or higher in the future.Another service that saw big growth in Q1 was Square Invoices. After integrating the service into the Square app in November 2016, Invoices has gained tremendous popularity. For the quarter, 225,000 actives used the Invoices service and drove about $700 million of GPV. On an annualized rate, Invoices is now close to $3 billion. Meanwhile, the Instant Deposits adoption rate is 66% higher among Invoice sellers than other Square sellers. Therefore, the strong product crossover should increase subscription and services revenue in the future.Hardware revenue in the first quarter of 2017 was $9 million, down 44% from the first quarter of 2016 and flat on a sequential basis. Management attributed the year-over-year decline to the fulfillment of the backlog of pre-orders for its contactless and chip reader in the first quarter of 2016.Given the strong results for the first quarter, management raised its full-year guidance to $890 million to $910 million vs. previous outlook of $880 million to $900 million. Square now expects total net revenue in Q2 will be $532 million to $538 million. Net loss is predicted to be between $0.07 and $0.09 per share, slightly lower than the $0.08 net loss per share in Q2 2016.ConclusionAfter analyzing the earnings report, I believe Square is moving in the right direction. There is massive untapped potential as two-thirds of businesses worldwide don't accept card payments yet. When Square expands into more countries, the roughly $50 billion in annual payment volume currently processed could increase significantly and help the company reach profitability.Right now, one of the biggest competitors to Square is PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Recently, PayPal announced 14 million active merchants are using its service to accept payments. With Square eyeing the same merchant market, the competition will be fierce. For Square to maintain its high market share, it has to continuing improving the app experience with speedy transactions for large and micro merchants. Management is aware of the challenge stating:In the end, I believe Square is firing on all cylinders and will outperform in 2017."

Analysts were worried that he wouldn't be able to juggle both Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Square at the same time. But if the recent performance is an indicator, he does seem to have turned Square around for the better.Square's FinancialsFor the first quarter, Square's revenues grew 22% over the year to $462 million, ahead of the Street's expectations of $451 million. Its platform processed $13.6 billion of gross payment volume, recording a 33% growth over the year. Loss per share of $0.04 also was significantly better than the market's expected loss of $0.08 per share. During the quarter, Square did not generate any revenues from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which transitioned away from their infrastructure during the fourth quarter of 2016.By segment, transaction-based revenue increased 34% to $403 million. Transaction-based revenue as a percentage of GPV was 2.96% in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 2.92% a year ago. Transaction-based profit as a percentage of GPV also increased from 1.03% to 1.07% in the reported quarter. Subscription and services-based revenue increased 106% to $49 million. Hardware revenue in the first quarter of 2017 fell 4% to $9 million.For the current quarter, Square forecast revenues of $223-$226 million and EPS of $0.03-$0.05. The market was looking for revenues of $224 million and earnings of $0.05 per share for the quarter. For the full year, Square raised its outlook for revenue to $890-$910 million with an EPS of $0.16-$0.20. Earlier it had forecast revenues to be in the range of $880-$900 million with an EPS of $0.15-$0.19. That is still marginally shy of the revenue consensus of $902 million and EPS of $0.18 per share for the year.Square's Market ExpansionSquare has been focused on international expansion. It has now gone live in the United Kingdom, and is now available in five countries including the US, Australia, Japan and Canada. Besides international expansion, the company also is benefiting from the delay that it takes for customers to pay by credit cards containing microchips.Square has been intensifying its focus on larger retailers instead of individual sellers. Recently, it launched Square for Retail, a mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) platform that is focused on the smaller and medium retailers. It is already seeing improved results from this focus. Within its seller mix, 43% of Square's merchants process over $125,000 in annualized GPV compared with 34% a year ago. Besides generating more business, the larger retailers also are prone to demand more value-added services that Square sells such as invoicing, Instant Deposit, and working capital.Until recently, Square had been looking at selling off its food delivery service Caviar. But considering that it did not get any suitors, it appears to be working on improving the offering instead. It is now working to integrate Caviar with Square and to expand Caviar from a food delivery service to a food ordering platform. It now leverages its technology from Square Cash to complete delivery payouts to all new Caviar couriers. Additionally, Square's offerings of payments, point-of-sale and order management help it reach more restaurants. I'm not crazy about the Caviar strategy, and consider it a distraction in an otherwise well-managed progression.The market is pleased with Square. Its stock is currently trading around a 52-week-high of $20.34 with a market capitalization of $7.7 billion. Square had listed in November 2015 and prior to listing its valuation was pegged at $6 billion. It hasn't had a very pleasant ride in the stock market but has been recovering nicely from the 52-week low of $8.77 it had fallen to in June last year."
4082137,102671,2017-06-17T12:37:38-04:00,"Square's growing ecosystem of products is proving extremely sticky with users.Doesn't show a profit now, but easily could if value-added services continue growing.Low penetration of potential market means that there is a lot of room for growth.Under reasonable future growth assumptions, Square's present value likely exceeds $20 billion, a significant premium above current market value.Recent surge in tech sector valuation means that shares could be overheated - I recommend that investors wait for the euphoria to die.","In his book One Up on Wall Street, famed investor Peter Lynch writes that he discovered many successful investments simply by keeping his eyes open while going about his daily life. Over the past few years, I have observed Square's (NYSE:SQ) products infiltrating an expanding number of small businesses that I frequent. Everyone from my 25-year old barber to the 60-year old mechanic who fixes my car now uses Square to take credit cards. That observation led me to look at the stock in 2016, but I did not understand the company's competitive advantage at the time. So what if it was selling card readers? Anyone can do that, including established rivals such as Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and Verifone (NYSE:PAY). Nothing from the annual report seemed to indicate a large moat, so I put aside any thought of buying the stock.Today I regret not looking into the company more carefully. Since then, the stock has risen 150 percent, pegging Square's value at $8.6 billion. My feeling is that the shares are overheated, but we will get back to that later. Right now, I want to focus on the business, which actually looks extremely compelling. The card readers themselves, while beautifully designed and easy to use, only scratch the surface. The real attractiveness of Square lies in the company's growing ecosystem of services, especially data analytics and financing through Square Capital. Even if Square is never widely adopted by large firms, the company's small business core still represents an enormous, largely untapped market. Here I will delve into Square and describe why I think it can easily become a $20 billion company.Business ModelSquare's most widely recognized products are its card readers and point-of-sale (POS) systems, which are sold at heavily discounted prices. The newest chip-and-pin card reader retails for just $49 while the Square stand goes for $99. The two products are combined with a smartphone and iPad, respectively, creating POS systems which are easy to set up and use. Many people are already familiar with phones and tablets, so the learning curve is not steep. In the spirit of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Square's hardware products have been widely praised for their user-friendly designs and aesthetic appeal.Source: Squareup.comHowever, Square's plan for profitability does not rely on selling hardware alone. Indeed, the business model more closely resembles a razor/razorblade approach. The ""razors"" are the inexpensive consumer-facing POS systems while the ""razorblades"" consist of high-margin services that Square markets to its commercial users. The most prominent revenue streams aside from the hardware are processing fees, data analysis tools, and financial products. A breakdown of FY 2016 revenue streams is shown below.Source: Square Annual Report, 2016Square's hardware line is highly unprofitable, although this makes sense in a razor/razorblade approach. The deal to process payments for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which was terminated last year, also seemed to function more as a PR scheme than a significant source of profits. However gross margins for transactions and services (35 percent and 65 percent, respectively) make up for the losses in hardware. Transaction revenue comes from the fees that Square charges to use its hardware. Square's services revenue consists of value-added software and financial products. The former follows a ""software as a service"" model, where users pay a monthly subscription fee for various business tools. These services are listed below in a screen shot from Square's website.The company's financing arm, known as Square Capital, likely drives the majority of sales accounted for under services. This year, Square Capital is on track to lay out over $1 billion in loans and cash advances. The company says that it has lent an average of $6,000 to over 100,000 individual merchants. Square claims that access to its borrowers' financial data allows the financing arm to keep default rate at a low 4 percent. Then, there is Caviar, the food-ordering app which Square purchased in 2014. Despite pressure to divest Caviar, Dorsey believes that the service remains vital to Square's future if it is successfully integrated into the company's ecosystem.MoatSquare's power lies in its core small business base. Prior to Square's arrival, small businesses were forced to deal with a disparate hodgepodge of business and payment solution providers. All of that is changing now, with Square streamlining a lot of inefficiency and directing users into its growing ecosystem of services. Although the company is often criticized for poor technical support, the products have proven remarkably sticky even in a crowded field. Square faces many big, established rivals, but these larger companies ignored small merchants for years in favor of catering to big clients that require specialized service.Once users are sucked into Square's ecosystem, I do not see how they can escape without considerable switching costs. My general impression from talking with Square users is that they would have a very difficult time operating without the products. As cash transactions continue to dwindle, the need for a simple payment solution will keep growing. At least one big player seems to agree. Visa (NYSE:V) disclosed a stake in the company early last year that amounts to 1 percent. I usually take it as a positive sign when an industry juggernaut invests in a small upstart, even if the holding is mere pocket change for a company like Visa.ValuationEven though estimating Square's future earnings requires some assumptions, one business truism clearly applies here: when a company can keep adding revenue streams to a single pipeline, profit margins will grow immensely. Square does not show a GAAP profit today, but I think it will get there based on reasonable assumptions about margins and future growth of current business lines. Square remains cagey about crucial figures such as its merchant count and services revenue, so estimating future earnings requires a bit of legwork.First I assume that Square counts 1.3 million individual firms in its network. The company has not revealed the number of active users for years, but I reached this number based on compound annual transaction revenue growth of 50 percent since the 250,000 merchant count reported in early 2013. This means that Square services only 4 percent of small businesses in the U.S., although the percentage is probably smaller because the company also operates internationally. If the company can expand its merchant base at 10 percent a year over the next decade, it could eventually have 3.3 million merchants. That is still only 12 percent of the 29 million small businesses in the U.S. today, so I think this is reasonable.Based on the above assumption, Square Capital is lending to about 7 percent of the company's merchant base. If it can get that up to 10 percent by 2027, it will be lending to over 300,000 businesses. If the average loan stays at $6,000, then the total loan volume will grow to $2 billion. With a default rate of 6 percent (have to assume a few bad years) and an APR of about 12.5 percent, I think Square could potentially pull in $238 million in finance revenue by 2027, nearly double what it does today. If software revenue also grows at similar rate, then total revenue attributable to services will surpass $300 million. Assuming gross margins remain unchanged at 65 percent, we could be looking at $220 million in gross profit from services by 2027. As to processing fees, I assume a 15 percent annual growth rate in gross profit using the FY 2016 base of $513 million.The final step is estimating future operating margin. Square's high operating expenses relative to gross profit has kept the company in the red, but this is a business that does not require continuous injections of capital once it builds up a sizable network. An operating margin of 30 percent is not unreasonable for a more mature technology company, so I apply this to Square's future earnings. Tacking on a multiple of 25 times earnings and discounting back to the present, we obtain a present value of nearly $22 billion.Shares Overheated?The considerable uncertainty surrounding Square's future earnings means that investors should seek a considerable margin of safety. Square's current market value stands at $8.6 billion, which I think is sufficiently below my estimate of fair value to warrant investment. But as I have written before, I believe that technology stocks are overvalued and that investors buying today will probably underperform the market for the foreseeable future. Even though Square appears significantly undervalued on a long-term basis, its association with the broader information technology sector means that shares could plummet in the event of a crash in tech. Even as I was working on this piece last Friday, shares dropped up to 9 percent amid that day's brief selloff in leading tech stocks.ConclusionThe quality and stickiness of Square's products show that the company is not a flash in the pan. Square's low market penetration and ever-growing ecosystem of value-added services position the company for growth well into the future. Even with very conservative assumptions about future earnings, Square appears significantly undervalued. Under normal circumstances, I would say that Square is almost a no-brainer. Alas, the shares are caught in a strong tech updraft propelling valuations into the stratosphere. With such euphoria surrounding the sector, I cannot bring myself to buy or recommend that others do.Maybe I will live to regret not buying now, but I would prefer to wait on Square until the valuation (hopefully) falls. I think that investors who hold their fire on this one will be more richly rewarded for their patience."
4069133,22148,2017-05-04T12:38:16-04:00,Square smashed Q1 estimates.The mobile payments provider is now worth in excess of $8 billion based on the updated share count.The valuation isn't adding up with the stock above $20.,"After the close on Wednesday, Square (NYSE:SQ) reported Q1 results that absolutely smashed analyst estimates. The mobile payments provider continues to shake off doubters that CEO Jack Dorsey can handle dual CEO roles with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).The stock surged beyond $20 on the report and smashed my investment thesis along the way that Square was now overvalued. The general question now is whether these results adjust the investment thesis.In the course of the last year, Square has gone from the market doubting the ability to leverage up growth to losing their biggest customer, yet still improving margins dramatically. The mobile payments provider went with a $0.05 adjusted loss last Q1 to a $0.05 profit last quarter.Investors though need to make sure they use accurate numbers when evaluating the stock. A lot of the financial sites are using the GAAP estimates for an $0.08 loss in which case Square only beat estimates by $0.04 due to reporting a $0.04 loss on a GAAP basis.Using the adjusted numbers, Square grew the EPS $0.10 over the prior year Q1. The adjusted net income improved by an incredible $30 million in one year.Another key point is the share count. Square is now reporting shares outstanding of 404 million even after buying out a 9.5 million share warrant from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) for $55 million.Remember that the listed share count was a big issue at the time of the IPO. The company listed up to 106 million stock options and the 9.5 million warrants making the potential diluted share count possibly up to 440 million shares.Now that Square is reporting a profit, the diluted share count should accurately include the stock options in the money now. Using this share count, the market valuation is now roughly $8.2 billion.At an adjusted revenue target of roughly $900 million, the stock trades at about 9.1x that sales target. Considering Square is only marginally profitable with a high-end target EPS target for 2017 of $0.24, excluding the convertible debt costs, making a stock value above $20 highly questionable.Investors see the market value of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) now reaching close to $60 billion, so chasing the stock becomes tempting. The valuation comparison should make one pause on Square.SQ PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that Square has exceeded even my highest expectations with the Q1 results. The stock though has already far outrun the actual results."
4059423,102979,2017-03-31T10:41:16-04:00,"Square – a mobile payment service provider, that also offers financial and marketing services – is severely overvalued.With a market capitalization of $6.1 billion, the market is pricing in high margin revenue growth over an extended period.Sell side analysts are largely bullish on this company with a “greenfield” growth opportunity.We believe Square is likely to underwhelm investors – in a significant way – on both the revenue and margin front over the coming years.We estimate a fair value of Square’s stock at $2.1 per share, which is roughly 90% below current market levels of $17.4.","Full report available hereSquare (NYSE:SQ) is a Payment Service Provider.At its core, Square provides a service that allows micro-merchants with low volumes of debit and credit card sales to obtain the benefits only a separate merchant account could otherwise have provided.Square provides hardware and software to merchants that enable them to accept debit and credit card payments. The card readers and stands attach to smartphones and tablets, providing a business with a point of sale solution. We estimate a fair value of Square's stock at $2.1 per share, which is roughly 90% below current market levels of $17.4.We believe Square is likely to underwhelm investors - in a significant way - on both the revenue and margin front over the coming years for the following reasons:1. Square's customer base of financially disadvantaged and fickle micro-merchants is fundamentally unattractive: While most merchant acquirers seek financially strong and commercially thriving customers, Square targets exactly the opposite; desperate micro-merchants looking for a quick and easy payment processing solution with low up-front cost. Square attempts to onboard as many of these financially disadvantaged micro-merchants as possible to its overpriced payment processing platform - with free or highly subsidized debit and credit card readers - in the hope that a few successful micro-merchants will justify the acquisition costs of the millions of unsuccessful others. This strategy has worked to-date due to a first mover-advantage in micro-merchant payment processing and a conducive economic environment. Square's anomalously high transaction margins of over 1% and its string of surprisingly strong results over the last five quarters can be explained by these dual tailwinds.Source: Bloomberg, Author calculationsHowever, the hyperbolic growth Square has experienced over the last eight years is not sustainable. Square needs a constant influx of new micro-merchants to replenish its existing cohort of older micro-merchants, close to 70% of whom are at risk of leaving the platform at some point during their respectively business lifecycles.The underlying dynamics of Square's business are ugly, characterized by an expensive mobile payment processing solution, a customer base with median card sales of just over $400 a month, high levels of merchant and GPV attrition - reaching 40% and 20% in a normal year, respectively - and potential recessionary merchant and GPV attrition rates, exceeding 50% and 40%, respectively. This dynamic will significantly dampen Square's Return on Invested Capital, compared to other payment service providers, such as PayPal and Heartland Payment Systems, who cater to a higher quality customer base.2. Analysts comparing Square to PayPal or First Data are comparing ""apples and oranges""; Square has more in common with Fitbit and GoPro: As a micro-merchant aggregator, Square's overpriced and commoditized product caters to a sub-prime customer base, has high transaction expenses, no moat, no network effects, no vertical integration, suffers from extreme competition and has almost zero switching costs. This contrasts with PayPal's payment processing platform that caters to a prime customer base, has a monopolistic presence as the internet's preeminent online wallet, a funding mix that frequently results in 100% margin transactions and high switching costs due to network effects developed from engaging both buyers and sellers.Source: Square and PayPal Q3 2016 earnings, Author calculationsSource: Visa, Author calculationsSquare also stands in contrast to First Data - a vertically integrated merchant acquirer and payment processor - that earns abnormal profits due to low customer acquisition and payment processing costs.Square has more in common with Fitbit and GoPro - pioneers in the connected fitness and action camera markets, respectively - that severely undershot lofty analyst projections because of the effects of brutal price competition in a commoditized low-barriers-to-entry business.3. Extreme competition from ISOs/MSRs and traditional merchant acquirers will limit Square's growth and margins: A look at the micro-merchant mobile payment service provider landscape shows a bewildering number of Square competitors offering cheaper ""no-frills"" alternatives or similar polished products. Notable ""no-frills"" competitor Electronic Merchant Systems offers ""EMS+"", a service with a flat all-inclusive rate of 2.25% per swipe - compared to Square's 2.75% - and a free card reader.Products with similar, and sometimes superior pricing, hardware and software to Square, include ""Spark Pay"" by Capital One, ""QuickBooks GoPayment"" by Intuit, ""PayPal Here"" by PayPal, ""Clover"" by First Data, and Pay Anywhere.Traditional merchant account providers, which includes many Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs) and Member Service Providers (MSRs), now also offer mobile processing rates that make Square's rates look very high. First Data's Clover has been gaining market share with over 500,000 devices shipped and 16% market share amongst its SMB clients - establishing a strong presence in a Square target market.There are also several new entrants. Chase Paymentech will soon be releasing a micro-merchant mobile payment processing solution with flat rates lower than Square's. Shopify has recently introduced a suite of POS products competing for micro- and small businesses. Verifone will soon be launching ""Carbon"", a payment terminal with a POS platform in a single device. And Poynt 5 and Poynt Smart Terminal are new open-architecture POS competitors to Square.4. Square is over-earning; Gross margins will come down due to lower take-rates and stubbornly high transaction costs: Square's outsized gross margins are likely to come down substantially over time as it experiences pressure on take-rates from extreme competition and its efforts to move upmarket to merchants with higher GPV, all the while experiencing stubbornly high transaction costs, particularly high interchange and assessment fees. Analysts are extremely sanguine on these key drivers of Square's profitability - forecasting stability far into the future - despite several warning signs. PayPal's decline in take-rates and transaction margins over the last few years provides us with empirical evidence and a historical precedent, while Heartland's transaction profit margin a full fifty percent below Square's show us the real-world challenges of merchant acquirers moving up-market.Source: https://investor.paypal-corp.com/, Author calculationsExhibit 13: Square's transaction profit margins are double Heartland's due to a focus on financially disadvantaged micro-merchantsSource: Heartland 10K, Square Q3 Shareholder letterInterchange and assessment fees, which comprise over 80% of the cost of a typical transaction, are highly persistent as evidence from a Federal Reserve study over the last six years shows. In the card processing food chain, card networks - like Visa and MasterCard - call the shots. Square does not have the influence to maintain its high pricing structure or retain its successful clients.5. Square has a limited Target Addressable Market in the U.S. and internationally: Square's over-bullish management team has misled the analyst community on the potential size of their TAM in the U.S., by repeatedly citing success with ""large sellers"" and U.S. card transaction volume of $10 trillion. The reality is that 99%+ of Square's customers, by number, are financially disadvantaged micro-merchants, with only a handful of SME customers. Square's prospects with large companies are extremely limited. For a business processing debit and credit card transactions with an average ticket size of $9 and monthly GPV greater than $7,700, leaving Square for a merchant account becomes economically preferable, due to special Visa/MasterCard small ticket rates. For businesses with higher average ticket sizes, the volume threshold is significantly lower due to the cap on debit card rates imposed by the Durbin Amendment. For example, for a merchant with an average ticket size of $30, the monthly GPV threshold to leave Square for a merchant account falls to $4,400.Square's business model does not work as well in other developed markets, such as the U.K., Europe and Australia, and emerging markets, such as China and India. In the case of the U.K., Europe and Australia, consumer interchange fees are heavily regulated at very low flat rates between 0.2%-0.3%, so Square's all-inclusive flat payment processing fee is far less attractive to merchants. In the case of Emerging Markets, low levels of credit card penetration and prevalence of cash transactions for micropayments make Square's solutions significantly less attractive. In this respect, Square also faces regulatory risks that would potentially make its business model far less appealing for micro-merchants in the U.S. and Canada. A cap on credit card interchange fees, like debit card ""swipe"" fees implemented by the Durbin Amendment, could be potentially devastating to Square, yet is not a possibility being considered by analysts.Square is also on the wrong side of a powerful technological megatrend towards digital payments and its hardware gateways risk obsolescence from larger innovative digitally focused payment solution providers, such as Apple, Google and PayPal, and even new tokenization technology such as that used by Apple Pay and Cartwheel Point of Sale. In fact, countries like China are leap-frogging debit and credit cards to move straight to online payment solutions like Alipay, WeChat Payment and Baidu Wallet.6. Analysts are overestimating growth of Square Capital, which will likely experience a fate similar to other non-bank lenders, like OnDeck Capital: Square's core payment processing business lacks operating leverage, so - to justify lofty price targets - analysts are modeling rapid revenue and margin growth from upselling of Square's ""value added services"" - particularly Square Capital. Square Capital is an unattractive source of funding for all but the most desperate and financially disadvantaged micro-merchants given APRs in the region of 16%-28%. In addition to larger merchants, Square Capital also presents an economically inferior solution for successful micro-merchants compared to alternatives. SBA working capital loans - targeted at profitable and growing micro-merchants - have APRs a full 6% to 18% lower than Square Capital.Square Capital is an attempt by management to stem the effects of GPV attrition due to successful micro-merchants leaving Square's overpriced payment processing platform for a more competitive solution. The decline of other non-bank online loan providers also reliant on fickle third-party funding sources, like OnDeck Capital, should serve as a cautionary tale for Square Capital.7. Micro-merchants have neither the business need nor financial wherewithal to afford Square's ""me-too"" software products: Square's other ""value added services"" consist of ""me-too"" software solutions, such as Square Payroll and Invoice (à la Quickbooks), Employee Management (à la Zenefits), Cash (à la Venmo), Online Store (à la Shopify) and Appointments (à la Google Calendar). The median Square customer is a financially disadvantaged micro-merchant with approximately $400 of card sales that has neither the business need nor the financial wherewithal to purchase complex accounting, employee management, email marketing, and loyalty software. Given sales of Square's software are tied to the number of customers subscribing to it, not GPV volume, it is highly likely that software sales will undershoot analyst forecasts. Another indicator of the low demand Square's ancillary software is likely to generate is the lack of any mention of ""ecosystem"" by experts when comparing payment service providers.Exhibit 21: Square's software products are expensive for the median Square micro-merchant with $5000 of annual card salesSource: www.squareup.com, Author calculations8. Unattractive industry economics and poor capital allocation decisions will detract from shareholder returns: Extreme competition and the fast pace of innovation in mobile hardware and software payment providers has led to unattractive industry economics with a need for extremely high R&D. In the twelve months ending September 30, 2016, Square devoted a full $263 million to product development, or 42% of adjusted revenues of $630 million. Given the lack of traction Square's ""me-too"" software products are likely to have with micro-merchants, we believe the return on this R&D will be poor.Operating in a commoditized yet fast faced industry has led to high levels of capital expenditures (CAPEX), in the form of regular acquisition spending. For example, to get in-house access to the latest NFC/EMV technology for payment cards, in 2015 Square acquired Kili Technology- a fabless semiconductor company based in Canada. More recently, Square also bought a ""software technology related to network connections"" for an undisclosed amount. We believe such regular acquisitions, which highlight the elevated CAPEX needs of this business, will continue, negatively impacting shareholder returns.Before focusing more exclusively on the current growth opportunity in micro-merchant card processing, CEO Jack Dorsey spent significant shareholder resources developing a failed food delivery business, first organically through Square Order, then through three acquisitions - Caviar in 2014 for $90 million, Fastbite in 2015 and Main Line Delivery in 2016. The returns on these investments have so far been poor, as these businesses continue to lose money. A ""misfit"" food delivery business shows a history of poor capital allocation. CEO Jack Dorsey is stretched thin, as he is also currently the CEO of Twitter, a company desperately trying to turnaround operations.Staying true to its Silicon Valley roots, Square is a prolific issuer of stock for acquisitions and to employees as compensation, thereby diluting existing and future shareholders - if the practice continues. Over the twelve months ended 12/31/2016, Square issued $138.8 million of Stock Based Compensation (SBC), primarily to its engineering, design, and product personnel in product development ($91.4 million). This comes to 20% of the Company's Adjusted Revenue of $687MM over the same period. Given what we believe to be Square's limited prospects for profitable growth, we believe this generous SBC will detract from shareholder value. Using a dilution adjusted Black-Scholes model, we calculate the negative impact value on equity of outstanding stock options at the current stock price to be approximately $963.5 million.Exhibit 24: Square's outstanding options are valued at almost $1 billion, based on a $17.43 stock price, and represent an overhang on the company's valuationSource: Author calculations9. The market is being too optimistic; Square's fair value is 80% below current levels: By valuing Square at $6.1 billion today, the market is implying a business that will grow revenues at close to 26% over the next ten years to over $7 billion, generate over $1.4 billion in operating income at margins close to 20% a year and generate ROICs close to 20% a year. This outcome is highly unlikely in our opinion given the realities of Square's customer base and business model.Exhibit 25: Square - Combining reverse DCF with a customer dynamics model shows the market's implied steady state customer and revenue figuresSource: Author assumptionsUnder more realistic conditions, Square will likely see a sharp deceleration in revenue growth over time as the realities of its fickle and financially disadvantaged customer base become more apparent.Our estimate of Square's long-term market share of the micro-merchant card payment processing market is approximately 7 million merchants, with strong competition from PayPal Here, Clover, QuickBooks GoPayment, Spark Pay, and Shopify.* Others include ""no-frills"" solutions like EMS+ and Cartwheel Point of Sale, ISOs/MSRs like Flagship ROAMpay, National Bankcard and CreditCard Processing.com. Author estimates.Exhibit 27: Projected Square revenues split between transaction, software and hardware revenues over the next 20 yearsIn a steady state, we believe Square will generate revenues of just over $2 billion, GAAP operating margins of 15%, Return on Invested Capital of 10%, with transaction margins close to 0.77% on a GPV of $171 billion.

4070527,98236,2017-05-08T08:13:15-04:00,"Square reported the results of its fiscal Q1 last week.The results were a beat on revenues of a noticeable level and an even more significant beat on profits.Management did raise guidance modestly but not by much more than the Q1 beat and the adjustment for the interest costs of the recent convertible debt offering.Based on historical seasonality and the strength of the company's non-payments businesses, it seems highly likely that the company will be beating and raising expectations in coming quarters.The company's strategies, including exploiting the opportunities within its base for extending loans and for instant deposit are driving results beyond expectations.","Square - Is the water too hot or the valuation too extended?There has been a fair amount of what can only be described as teeth gnashing this earnings season. Bears have lots of sharp teeth but this hasn't been a good earnings season in which to be a bear in the IT sector. Far too few salmon for them to catch. Sure there have been a few blow-ups - IBM (NYSE:IBM) perhaps, or Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) - no perhaps about that one. But most earnings release in the IT sector this quarter has been beats although not always satisfactory guidance. Gigamon (NYSE:GIMO) comes to mind as an exemplar in that later categoryMany analysts just can't seem to deal with some of the tea leaves out there. People hate to hear about the digital revolution but it is real enough. Writing this particular article in the wake of another disappointing quarter in terms of productivity growth, it is evident that much traditional capex is not producing appropriate returns. Firms looking to enhance productivity have few choices other than to invest in IT since other investments are simply not achieving returns. For some time into the future, IT firms will mainly beat expectations because the technologies now becoming commercialized including AI, the cloud and a few other really do represent a revolution in the value available from IT.One such company that is benefiting from a confluence of trends is Square (NYSE:SQ) which reported its results the other day. The results were strong and probably stronger than the headlines fairly represent. The guidance increase, while at least noticeable, remains conservative enough for this writer to believe that the company will be able to reprise beats for the balance of the year. And some of the sub-headline trends, particularly those that have led to a much shorter path to profitability, are not totally recognized even by analysts who have written notes in the wake of the earnings release.Yes, Square shares have what some feel are extended valuation metrics. And yes, the shares are volatile and may from time to time, afford investors better entry points than they do at an all-time high. And I am quite aware that the shares have more than doubled the past year and are up 50% YTD. I own them and have been more than a bit gratified by their performance.I well realize that the recent appreciation cadence is not likely to be sustained going forward. But in looking carefully at the earnings release as I propose to do in the balance of this article, there is more to like beyond just the headlines and that ""more to like"" has the potential to sustain valuation levels that will keep bears gnashing their sharp and numerous teeth.Some numbers to considerJust for the record, Square reported adjusted revenues of $204 million for the quarter up 39% year over year. Adjusted revenue excludes revenues derived from Starbucks and also excludes revenues that are essentially derived as a pass-through based on the cost of processing credit cards. Most analysts use adjusted revenues in calculating valuation metrics although the metric is not the one employed by Yahoo Finance.Gross Payment Volume increased by 33% year on year with particular strength seen in volumes coming from the company's larger sellers. The company's take rate was basically consistent after adjusting for a year-ago promotional program, even with the shift to GPV from larger merchants. Most significantly, I think, for forecasting future revenue trends was the 106% increase in subscription and services based revenues. The 106% revenue growth was driven by Square Capital, Caviar (restaurant delivery) and instant deposit. These are all high margin businesses, and at scale will operate at far higher margins than the payments component of this company. While I think that Square's payment business will continue its growth trajectory and will, over time, continue to improve margins, this is the area of Square's business on which to focus. The fact that percentage growth actually accelerated quarter on quarter is a harbinger, I think of very favorable trends in both revenue growth and in operating earnings for this company.The company generated non-GAAP EPS of $.05 for the first quarter which compares to prior expectations of a non-GAAP loss. The company showed significant expense discipline in the quarter that was stronger than I had anticipated. In particular, on a GAAP basis, research and development spending rose by just 6% year on year. Sales and marketing expense rose by 30% and general and administrative costs, adjusted for a one time legal settlement in the prior year, were up by 23%. With all operating categories rising more slowly than revenues and with gross margins rising because of both mix and higher profit rates in the various categories, operating margins were positive in a Q1. It is a striking achievement and somewhat surprising at this stage of Square's development.It is worth noting that the beat was not built on the back of stock based comp increase. Stock based comp was flat year over year in the just reported quarter. The quarter also was comparing against a quarter in which the company shipped a substantial volume of new card readers. The decline in hardware shipments, caused the top line growth metric to compress by about 300 bps.The company was cash flow positive for the quarter compared to cash flow burns in the past. The major difference in cash flow year over year was the fall in the GAAP net loss. Stock based comp was 70% of CFFO. The company generated free cash flow in the quarter of about $37 million. Yes Jack Dorsey (and CFO Sarah Friar) and the rest of the team appear to know how to run a business that while still in hyper-growth mode is beginning to generate returns for shareholder.A deeper dive into those non-payments components of Square and how they may relate to guidance.Square shares have been controversial to one degree or the other since the company went public going back to the fall of 2015 when its IPO was said to flop. It is interesting to read the articles from back then about the tech bubble deflating. Of course it really seemed that way for a time.But in the event, the shares are 70% above where they started trading and are 32% higher compared to the first day close. They remain controversial and as mentioned earlier, despite the quarter just reported, two analysts, one at Guggenheim and one at CFRA cut their ratings from hold to buy although each analyst raised their price target rating by about 10%. The analysts are concerned about valuation, and should I simply take the company's guidance at its face, perhaps I would be of a similar opinion.The company's published guidance, which will inevitably be the basis for First Call consensus forecasts was raised very modestly. The forecast for revenue was increased by $10 million at the mid-point to a level would represent 31% growth in full year revenues. Non-GAAP EPS guidance is also up by just a penny despite the stronger Q1 beat. Part of the relatively modest increase in earnings expectations is the expense of the convertible the company sold which will cost $.04/share in earnings this year. I think it is reasonably certain that in the nature of things, the company did not sell the convertible to lose $.04/share and the higher cash balance will be used to augment the growth of the company's business. But regardless, the guidance didn't do much for investors.But one thing to consider at the start of this discussion is the substantial acceleration in the company's subscription/services business. Not only was it up 106% year on year but it rose by 20% sequentially. Overall, Square Capital saw revenues increase by 64% year on year and Caviar revenues more than doubled. The potential for Caviar as the flywheel of an ecosystem that includes payments, payroll, menu ordering, invoicing and other services is just starting to take off at this point and the kinds of percentage gains seen in Q1 are seem likely to extend through at least the balance of the fiscal year.I do not quite know how to describe the opportunities for Square Instant Cash. The old saw about ""nice work if you can get it' applies in spades. It is simply hard to imagine a more lucrative business that is legal. With transaction losses at negligible levels, charging customers a 1% fee so they can have instant access to the proceeds of a transaction as opposed to having the funds available in a day is one of the highest margin business opportunities available. The company did not explicitly call out the revenues it collected for the service but the growth rate was clearly well into double digits and perhaps more and it was, just in itself, a significant component of margin growth that had not been anticipated.The company has recently launched Square Cash. Square cash is a service that is very similar to that offered by PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo. It is likely, however, that it will generate some worthwhile fees for SQ as there are fees for business and credit card transactions. Specifically, and probably of most significance at this point, is that if merchants want to receive immediate payment from a customer bank account, SQ will charge a 2.75% fee. Small businesses are cash poor and are looking for ways to multiply their working capital resources. Cash and Instant Deposit along with Capital are more of a breakthrough than many investors appreciate.Square already uses the same technology that underlies cash as the payment mechanism for its Caviar delivery couriers. Last quarter the company introduced a ""pick-up"" service which allows end-user customers to order from restaurant clients on-line and pick-up the food rather than having it delivered. I honestly wouldn't have thought of something like pick-up as an important offering but apparently it is. As compared to an offering such as Uber, Square offers its sellers POS, order management and payroll as well as a API's that allow the offering to be customized. These differences appear to have distinguished the service significantly from competitors and have allowed for the very rapid growth of Caviar. Much of the enhanced profitability is coming from additional services, including of course, capital and instant deposit which are the tail of offering restaurant delivery.Food delivery is usually considered a mundane, low margin space and Square has to compete with Uber, a company who presumably has some obvious advantages in delivering both food and people. It is these ""at the margin"" services that have allowed SQ to grow Caviar at triple digit rates and for the company to penetrate far larger restaurants than would otherwise be possible.One of the major issues for SQ is just how much leverage it can achieve through the use of machine learning and other elaborations of AI in making credit decisions. Typically making credit decisions for small businesses has been laborious and time consuming. Using machine learning has dramatic implications for productivity and at least thus far is also producing lower loan losses than some might anticipate for this service. The fact is that one of the secrets of the Q1 outperformance was just that.SQ appears to be able to manage risk far better than banks or other small business lenders simply because the company sees point of sale data on a daily basis and uses that data to evaluate, on a quantitative basis, the probabilities of collecting its advance. To some, it may sound like magic but transaction and losses on advances continue to outperform guidance. The company's loan losses have dropped under 4% for the 2 nd quarter running and were one reason for the significant EPS beat.The credit services that SQ offers would not be feasible without the technology, and at least thus far, the machines are doing the credit analysis far faster, for far less cost and with better results than would be possible using humans. That is one of the company's secret sauces that is really not well understood-and it is an enormous competitive moat compared to other competitors who simply facilitate transactions.Perhaps it is not intuitive to think of the delivery of restaurant meals and cash advances as part of the foundation of a high tech growth story. It might be even more surprising to find them as competitive moats.Part of the reason why SQ has maintained a persistently high ""take rate"" even as it goes up market and sees a steadily rising percent of its business (43% last quarter up from 39% the prior year) coming from larger merchants-although SQ's definition of larger merchants relates to clients with GPV's of greater than $125k/year-relates to the entirety of its value proposition. It offers very small merchants the opportunity to get paid for sales either the same day or the next day. It offers larger sellers a great variety of services that are hard to find on a single platform beyond payment processing.Another key to this company going forward is going to be and to some extent already is, its ability to sell all of the products that it has recently launched. The company affords relatively smaller business the opportunity to use purchase orders to receive inventory and it has advanced reporting (dashboards) that allows these smaller businesses to have the kinds of analytics heretofore limited to much larger merchants such as determining cost of goods ratios for different locations.They can readily purchase all of the other services that SQ offers through the dashboard. I am a bit surprised that the strategy is working-but hey, as the saying goes, you never know. SQ offers a service that allow users to send invoices which are typically paid far more promptly than paper invoices and qualify sellers for Instant Deposit and that good old 1% haircut.The company highlights some use cases in its shareholder letter. Of course the use cases are commercials-companies like this are not going to miss a chance to articulate their qualitative success. But the fact is that the numbers, to one extent or the other, validate what appears to be happening in Square's customer universe.A customer cited in this quarter's letter was a coffeehouse chain called Philz. My impression is that Philz is a high end coffee chain that competes with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). I personally have never seen the establishment and given its location in New York, I am not sure I ever will. If the chain ever reaches mid-town or better still the Upper East Side, well that will be exciting. I love specialty coffee.But the point is that Philz is sort of a poster child for what a larger seller gets from Square. The company is able to track digital receipts to which it adds its own CRM data that is integrated on the Square platform. It uses the data to make specialized offers to specific customers who actually have consumed what is being offered. It uses Caviar delivery to reach corporate customers. And now it uses the Square pick-up ap with Square ordering so customers are spared the unpleasantness of standing in line. Square will clearly not convert all or even most of its sellers to use most its available eco-system. But it's that 43% of its GMV already coming from larger sellers who are the prime market for its add-on services. Cross-selling and up selling are clearly far easier and more productive opportunities than finding new name customers. The opportunity to grow the $49 million base of revenues outside the payment space appears very under-appreciated by some observers and analysts and it is a reason why the company's guidance is likely to prove highly conservative.There are no doubt readers on this site who will remain unconvinced that Square has laid a sound foundation for an IT service beyond a simple payment system. Payments, in particular, is very competitive space and many reader/commentators believe that price competition will interdict the company's path to profitability. Some seemingly believe that there is no real business in selling payment service to micro-merchants.I have tried to lay out what I believe the company's strategy is beyond payments. It seems to be working and it seems to be obviating price competition. I think management is more aware than anyone the risks in establishing a strong business in a space still being born with many competitors real and potential. It is very difficult to gainsay the success the company has had in its first few years of life.The $49 million quarterly number for subscription services is some evidence of what appears to be happening. I think, as well, the growth in both the company's GMV and the shift toward larger merchants are positive indications that the company is outgrowing its roots in servicing micro-merchants of uncertain longevity and financial viability. I understand the negative case and to be sure 11 of 28 analysts rate the shares as a hold, although generally because of valuation. But to my mind, the preponderance of the evidence suggests that the strategy conceived by Jack Dorsey, Sarah Friar and the rest of the management team is based on quite a bit more than wishful thinking and hype.Talking about Square guidanceAs mentioned, SQ guidance doesn't quite add up. Or perhaps it more than adds up depending on one's viewpoint. The CFO was quite insistent that analysts use a 31% full year growth rate in their models. Her comments regarding that during the conference call were unmistakable and given her former career, she know how the game is played. No doubt, all published models will do so. I know if I were publishing research for an investment bank I would most surely follow the course of least resistance in that regard. I have tried to look at some other numbers in building my own set of expectations. Given the start the company had to the year, I would be surprised if full year revenue growth did not come to 35% with EPS of $.25 or a bit greater. Management has taken a tack in which it hopes to beat and raise every quarter and that is likely to help to support and increase share price valuation.Please remember that this discussion is based on adjusted revenues rather than revenues that are seen in Yahoo Finance and elsewhere. As mentioned, adjusted revenues exclude Starbucks revenues from 2016 and exclude pass through credit card fees in both periods. Clearly, the 31% growth the company is forecasting this year, would represent a material slowdown in growth for the balance of the year after a Q1 in which revenues grew by 39%. That is simply inconsistent with both the metrics seen in Q1 as well as normal seasonality.Q2 revenue expectations are based on 10% sequential growth or $21 million. Given the rate at which non-payment revenue is rising ($8 million sequentially in the slowest quarter of the year), the company is, in essence, forecasting an 8% increase in sequential payment revenues. As mentioned, the normal seasonality of Q1 to Q2 is probably greater than that to say nothing of the company's continuing success at attracting new sellers, both micro-merchants and larger, more stable businesses. Last year, the company achieved 25% sequential growth in subscription and software revenues sequentially between Q2 and Q1. In addition, the company achieved 14% sequential growth in payment revenues in Q2.The company has launched in the UK and over time, that will probably be a significant revenue generator. But it would be surprising to see any material revenues in Q2 from the UK. Still, even marking down expected seasonal growth would leave the company the ability to exceed its projections by 4-5% both for Q2 and for the balance of the year. This incremental revenue would come at a very high margin and could increase non-GAAP earnings by an additional $.05-$.07 above current projections.ValuationI will stick with management guidance in looking at valuation metrics. The upside, should it occur, will be lagniappe, rather than something I want to embed in these numbers. And at some level, it really doesn't matter if the company earns $.20 or $.25. No one buying the shares currently is going to do so because the P/E is 80X, on a non-GAAP basis, rather than 100X.Square currently has about 367 million shares outstanding. The shares closed on Friday at a price of $19.78. That yields a market capitalization of a bit less than $7.3 billion. The company, in the wake of the sale of its convertible offering has a net cash position of $627 million. At that level of cash, enterprise value is $6.6 billion. So, the EV/S based on adjusted revenues is at 7.3X. That is probably a metric that puts the company in the middle of the pack with regards to growth rate plotted against EV/S.As mentioned, while the company is non-GAAP profitable, it has a P/E at a level that is not supportive of valuations based on traditional valuations levels for this metric. No one buying the shares these days is doing so because of its P/E and it will be a couple of years before reported earnings catch up to the share price.As mentioned, CFFO last quarter came to $44 million compared to a burn in the year earlier period. To an extent, CFFO for this company depends on the volume of loans the company originates and how much it sells. It did not report on its specific relations with 3 rd party investors who fund the majority of the company's advances to merchants. The company's charge-offs continue to run slightly below its provision for loan losses. That can be a significant factor in cash flow, but has not been an issue thus far.Last year the company generated a little bit of cash for the year as a whole, almost all of it coming in Q3 when stock based comp reached its apogee on a quarterly basis. The company doesn't provide cash flow guidance and given the issue regarding its sale of the advances it makes to its sellers, such a projection would be difficult to make for any given quarter. But assuming that metric remains as it has been and that stock based comp remains at Q1 levels (far lower than was the case at the end of 2016), the company should be able to generate $150-$200 million in operating cash. Capex for this company has been and is likely to remain minimal. It was $6.5 million last quarter and that is down a bit from the prior year. Even at the top of the range, It would seem that free cash flow is unlikely to be greater than $150 million. At that level, the free cash flow yield would be 2.3%, Again, while that is probably a better number than average these days for a company growing beyond 30%, it is not at a level that could be described as a value.I own these shares and have done so for some time now. I appreciate the strategy as I see it and believe that it will lead to sustained growth of 30% or more with a significant level of profitability. I am patient when I see so many of the company's initiatives seeming to develop in a positive fashion. While it is inevitable that the company is not going to show the level of share price appreciation that has marked its performance year to date, I believe that the probability of more beat and raise quarters will afford investors with positive alpha going forward."
4035482,102228,2017-01-10T06:46:31-05:00,"Shares in Square Inc. are back on the rise after taking a breather from the rally that saw shares increase in value over 30% in two short months.The pullback stopped exactly where it needed to, and past resistance became support. This price action is exactly the type of movements technicians look for.Options trading has been heating up again, the last time we saw this was in late October and November 2016, right before SQ broke out and started to rally.Investors should get long shares ahead of the breakout. Square is a great fundamental story with attractive technicals.","It hasn't been long since my last article on Square Inc. (NYSE:SQ). The stock market moves fast which means I must move equally quickly. In my last article on Square Inc. found here, I told readers to watch the 13.50 level in SQ shares like a hawk. 13.50 was an important level and if these new higher prices were to stick that level needed to hold. And hold it did, almost to the penny, traders took note of the strength of the support and quickly bid shares 11% higher over the next 5 trading days. The breakout from the 13.50 level and the run to recent highs at 14.75 ish was important, but Square shares have traded at these levels in the past. If SQ shares can push through 15.50, the breakout will be one of the most important in SQ's history, and many on Wall Street will likely take note.If SQ shares break 15.50 with authority, it will be what is sometimes called a ""Blue Sky Breakout."" In a blue sky breakout, all previous resistance levels are cleared, and there is literally nothing in its way, at least from a technical perspective. During a blue sky breakout, the herd mentality can take over, bidding shares to levels that beget any rational fundamental valuation. Pros often buy breakouts because they often come with momentum.Momentum is one of the few stock market phenomena that exists and can be beneficial to investors. Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management has researched the phenomenon extensively, and many of the firm's funds invest on this principal alone. At its heart momentum is when securities that have done well vs. its peers continue to do well vs. its peers for an extended period. It's why you often hear investment prostalking about investing in the stocks that have done well and not the stocks that are bombed out. The adage ""buy low sell high"" is a bit of a fallacy. Most pros out there ""buy high sell higher"" and avoid trying to catch falling knives and pick bottoms.What does this have to do with breakouts? Blue sky breakouts names can become great momentum names because as they get going, they are breaking out nearly every day. Some technicians have a bunch of fancy ways to measure how far they think the breakout might go. I've done better trimming some stock after the breakout (ringing the register if you will) and setting a stop on the rest at the breakout. I've been able to capture some really big moves using this strategy but to each their own.So why am I so certain a Square Inc. breakout is about to occur? One of the reasons why is the options flow, let's look under the hood there and see what's happening.SQ Option Flow:I've been watching SQ call option flow for the last 4 trading days. From 01/04/17 to 01/09/17 Calls have been trading over 5X vs. puts. I've seen over 7k call options bought on the bid or mid in those same 4 days, and nearly all have been new open interest (new options bought from market makers). I thought a participant was ringer of the register for a moment but saw them roll into higher options just a moment later (selling the calls they had gains on and buying new higher strikes). This rolling of options is a common practice for professional traders, and you see it when they have conviction in a trade. Even if we take just a one-day snapshot, in this case, 01/09/2017 we can see how much more volume is on the call side:(Source: Nasdaq.com)Over 4,400 calls traded on just Jan 9th vs. under 200 puts. Clearly, nobody is interested in protection in SQ shares right now, at least not with puts. I can't say I'm surprised at option action like this. Flow in this manner in not uncommon as you get close to breakouts. Market participants try to get exposure to the breakout as cheaply as they can, and there is no better tool than options for that kind of trading. Now that we have seen some of the options flow lets get down to the core of this thesis, the technicals.SQ Technicals:SQ technical picture:(Source: stockcharts.com)That right shoulder I was worried about didn't form and turned into nothing more than a quick pullback. The MACD looks good again, and the RSI, while high is not currently egregiously high. The concerns that were present before remain: SQ is quite a bit higher than all its moving averages. SQ shares are also quite a bit away from the longer trend line that goes back to when SQ shares bottomed in July. It looks like traders have become interested with its new steeper trendline that has formed since November after the company reported its 2016 Q3 numbers.If SQ shares don't go up to 15.50 and break through (or bounce off, a scenario that wouldn't be good for longs), I could see shares pulling back to 14.70 ish and would look for support there (a level that was previously resistance). I like this chart, but I'm choosing to play it with stock on this one. I just haven't had success trading SQ options but have done well with the equity, so I'm sticking with that works. A more aggressive player might take a look at those Feb. 2017 16 calls that were active on 01/09/17 for a supercharged bet that SQ shares break out and move much higher.A more conservative trader might wait for the breakout to happen and buy shares when it's confirmed; such a trader would be happy to give up 4-5% to be sure they are dealing with a true breakout. Chalk me in the ""a breakout is going to happen"" camp, it might wobble a few times before (another reason I'm going with stock and not options), but I think SQ is going through 15.50. And when it does I think you'll be hearing a lot more from the talking heads regarding this name.Conclusion:I didn't think I'd be talking about SQ so soon; sometimes that's just how it is. Pullbacks can happen over months or sometimes days; SQ went with the latter. I've talked in depth about the business opportunity Square Inc. presents. It's a story that I simply want to be exposed. If I can get exposure to a story I like with good technicals to boot I'll take it.There have been some rumors that Jack Dorsey the CEO of both Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Square Inc. might be stepping down as CEO of Twitter. I honestly couldn't tell you if that would be a good thing or a bad thing over the long-term but in the short-term, it likely would be net positive for shares of SQ. In my opinion, SQ shares have been hurt by its unwarranted affiliation with Twitter. If Square could get that bogeyman off its shoulder, it would undoubtedly be a good thing.I think Square Inc is one of the great disruptive companies of our time on both the payments side and SME lending side; it's a phenomenal company. If the street came around to SQ's story (and it looks like they are doing just that) and shares get some momentum behind them I believe it could earn a place amongst the other great momentum stocks of the world. If that happens who knows how high it could go, I'm willing to invest and see and with a chart like Square's I think you should take a look as well."

This contract expired in 3Q16 and while it will negatively impact the Net Revenue of Square as Starbucks contributed to ~11% of Square's Net Revenue, it will have a positive impact on the Gross Profit as Square was losing money in the Starbucks contract.Source: Company FilingsSquare Capital - Synergy at its bestSquare Payment platform gives Square capital an advantage which many other lending platforms like Lending Club or Ondeck do not have. Using the Square payment platform, Square capital is able to do 2 important things at no cost - Finding the potential clients and evaluating their credibility. While Square capital is doing this more swiftly and effectively, it also has an added advantage of being able to use the company's revenue as security for loans. All of this combined together makes Square capital a high margin as well as a fast growing business segment which will drive the revenue and profitability in coming years.Movement in stock priceUnlike many Unicorns, share price of Square is trading at a price higher than its IPO price. Although the stock price has been volatile in the last 1 year, the stock has been moving upward since the drop in July. SQ was trading at $14.45 on 30th Jan, 61% higher than its IPO price of $9 in Nov 2015.Source: NasdaqHow did the competitors do?Performance of share price of SQ has been better than its peers. While share price of SQ has increased significantly in the last one year, share price of PYPL (Paypal) and INTU (Intuit Inc) has not changed much. Share Price of PAY (Verifone System) has been very volatile and has fallen in the last 1 year.Source: NasdaqIs it worth investing in a loss making company?Assessing the intrinsic value for companies like Square with negative profits and high growth is a bit tricky. Square cannot be compared to a company like Paypal which is already making profits. An investor should consider the fact that SQ is not expected to make any profit in the next 2 years. However, given the robust business model and strong track record of growth, SQ can be worth putting your bet on."

Only time will tell about how this pans out for the new app in a market with several such service providers.Square, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) has just announced and launched its newest creation - the Square retail app - touted as ""a comprehensive backend package of tools that include complete coverage of inventory management, customer relationship management and employee tools.""Square is a popular tool for traders due to its wide array of software and hardware products, including the Square Reader, Square Stand, Square Cash, Square Capital and the Caviar service. Square Register, Square Payroll and Customer Engagement are all available through a monthly subscription. The launch of the Square Retail app is bound to bring a shake-up in the small business sector as merchants seek a simple but all-encompassing solution to their needs.Modern business is increasingly reliant on cashless payments, and Square seems to be keen on grabbing a large market share through customer-centric innovations that ensure safety and convenience. Square's creations are built on the concept of leveraging technology to ease commercial transactions and keep track of financial performance. The new app is the first solely-owned product of Square this year, coming after the partnership with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in January that saw the scrapping of fees incurred by Square users on Apple pay.What is on the table?The user interface of the SR app is most compatible with businesses that deal in processed or packaged products - read those that have barcodes. It contains a smart inventory management system, which makes it easier to search product information or sort out the inventory using an intuitive search bar.The new dashboard enables users to create a directory containing customer profiles and add staff notes. The inbuilt CRM feature allows merchants to keep track of shoppers' habits such as frequency of visit, average amount of money spent and type of products bought.Fragmented businesses will find the employee management tool useful in keeping track of shifts and hours worked. Perhaps the key feature of the app is its usability and convenience, which are the backbone on which Square builds all its apps. Also, SR joins the famed Square 'ecosystem', which is really about Square being a one-stop shop for all services required by businesses.One factor that will make SR a frontrunner in the business apps is the ""Build with Square"" feature that allows users to customize apps for flexibility in business solutions. Further, as with all Square products, SR can be integrated into iOS, Android or tablet computers. Apart from the traditional 2.75% transaction fee, merchants will pay $60 monthly charges per register for the SR.ConclusionSince it IPO'd in 2015, Square has amassed a membership of more than 3 million merchants. In the last earnings call, Square seems to be living up to its call of giving the best value proposition to shareholders. Quarterly revenues exceeded the previous guidance, with payment volume going up 39% to $13.2 billion. This growth was driven by several factors including improved transaction speeds on card readers, faster checkout process and an increase in large-volume merchants by 55% YoY. Being a payments processing company, the performance of Square is largely dependent on the speed and convenience it affords its users.Square is keen on nurturing the instant deposit service which allows users to transfer money to their bank account instantly at a 1% fee. Within one year, this service has seen 4 million deposits from 200,000 sellers.The SR app is expected to add onto the already hefty profits from the payments business, which grew 36% to $134 million. The robust system is expected to be received well by large businesses in need of a robust system for their multiple needs. Also, Square is on a bid to reduce the transaction speed from 4 seconds to 3. Square is currently trading at $14.73. As a whole, I consider Square to be a worthwhile investment given the innovative line of products it has on offer. In addition, the strong focus on increasing the number of merchants on its platform ensures a steady revenue stream for the company."
4038963,22148,2017-01-24T10:29:14-05:00,Square now trades near all-time highs.Pac Crest analyst oddly suggested the business model was under appreciated despite the huge run in the stock.The market appears confused on a lot of the metrics surrounding Square making the mobile payments provider one to buy on dips.,"After a stock has made a significant run, investors should re-evaluate any position. Such is the case of Square (NYSE:SQ) where my previous investment thesis was to load up some $5 lower.The mobile payments stock has made a massive run from $8.50 back last June to nearly $15 now. The stock now approaches the all-time highs for the limited time since going public at the end of 2015 potentially setting off some warning signs.About two weeks ago, Pac Crest listed Square as a top idea in the payments area. Analyst Josh Beck suggested the small and medium business software opportunity is under appreciated.My research suggests that isn't exactly the case now that the stock is up at $15. The prime issue being that investors don't always correctly factor in the outstanding share count.For Q3, Square listed an outstanding share count of only 344 million shares. The actual fully diluted share count is closer to 450 million outstanding shares. At $15, the stock is actually worth around $6.75 billion.The company guided towards full-year 2016 adjusted revenues at up to $680 million. My previous estimate was that a 35% growth rate in 2017 will push revenues over $900 million. For Q3, revenues grew at 51% suggesting 35% might is conservative.Square would trade at 7.5x those estimates sales numbers for 2017. A 30% growth rate in 2018 places the adjusted revenue target at $1.17 billion. The stock trades at roughly 5.8x those '18 revenue targets.Unlike Pac Crest, the market seems to fully value the potential of Square. Especially considering the mobile payments provider isn't even profitable according to the market.Even on this measure, the market is again oddly using GAAP measures to assess profitability. For Q3, the non-GAPP net income would amount to around $4 million when excluding the massive $36 million in stock-based compensation expenses.The below table highlights the EBITDA calculation showing that the primary difference between the reported loss and positive EBITDA is stock-based compensation.Source: Square Q316 shareholder letterThis revelation doesn't alter the valuation metrics that are off the charts if using the guidance for $20 million in 2016 EBITDA. Though the non-GAAP profit does provide cushion for the stock on the downside as the cash balance is up to $530 million from the positive EBITDA and proceeds from employee stock options.The key investor takeaway is that Square is likely trapped below $15 for most of 2017. As the company improves EBITDA in 2017 and shows sustainable high growth, the stock eventually becomes a buy, especially on any dips back to levels below $12."
4049761,98236,2017-02-26T05:43:34-05:00,Square reported the results of its fiscal Q4 late last week and did turn the corner to full-year adjusted net income.The company overattained its projected revenues and much of that dropped through to a far more robust bottom line than forecast.The company continues to record strong gains in payment processing while its software and services are growing at very strong rates and producing high margins while doing so.The company's Square Capital business continues its record of fast growth with a high level of operational efficiency.,"Square - The emergent business strategy starts to show its potentialOK, here we go again. A couple of days ago, Square (NYSE:SQ) reported the results of its Q4 and full year 2016 business results. The results and attendant guidance can be broadly characterized as another quarter of beat and raise. Interestingly to me, was that the raise part was more on earnings. The company is now forecasting growth of 30% in adjusted revenues, but it expects adjusted EBITDA to more than double in 2017.Over the past year that I have been following the name, I have been particularly impressed with the company's strategy of being able to offer lots of pieces of IT services that merchants needed in order to be successful. The shares jumped 21% last week and have reached an all-time high since the company went public in late 2015. Now what? The company has attracted some high-profile brokerage recommendations both before and in the wake of the successful quarter. These have included buy recommendations from Citigroup, Nomura, Guggenheim, Needham and Deutsche Bank. Most of the other analysts who cover the name raised their price targets, although the average price target is below the current share price and more than 40% of analysts reporting their recommendations to First Call rate the shares a hold.The balance of the article will go through the nuts and bolts of what is happening at Square - but to put it succinctly - and yes, I know what succinctly means - Square is about building a platform that enhances the ability of smaller merchants, and some larger ones as well, to optimize the IT processes of their businesses. That's working and it is not easy to quantify the dimensions of that kind of an opportunity. I won't try to assign a price target to these volatile shares. They are not cheap using some metrics. But I think the company has a significant chance of seeing growth develop at rates faster than currently forecast, and I expect that management will continue to ensure that the company can beat and raise estimates going through 2017.Square shares, after going through a period I might refer to as high amplitude stagnation after I first wrote about the name back in April 2016, have appreciated by 54% in just the last 4 months. The odds of that performance reprising are pretty low. The shares are up by 70% over the last year. That is another bar that seems a bit too high. But between that kind of historical performance and positive alpha there is a vast territory, and if the trends that the company saw in Q4 continue as I think they will and some of its product initiatives come to positive fruition, there is plenty of upside remaining.The nooks and crannies of a SquareMany observers have perceived that SQ is a payments company doomed to founder on the shoals of declining pricing and little differentiation. It does take payments efficiently and taking payments is usually the first introductions its sellers have to the company. Last quarter, the company's gross payment volume reached $13.7 billion, up by 34% and excluding any significant contribution from Starbucks. (NASDAQ:SBUX) The company's ""take rate"" on GPV was 2.94% in the quarter, consistent with prior periods. The sequential growth of GPV this last quarter of less than 4% was perhaps at a lower cadence than some might have expected, although higher than the company forecast at the end of Q3. The company has shifted its focus to larger sellers who now account for 42% of GPV and perhaps this has modified the expected growth rate for GPV while increasing overall profitability.The company reports ""adjusted revenues"" which exclude the payment processing fee charged by the major credit card vendors who process transactions recorded by the Square infrastructure. Using that as metric, as most analysts do, revenues rose 43% for the period and rose 52% for the year. Sequential growth was about 8% during the quarter and is expected to be at negligible rates in Q1 based on seasonality. Adjusted for the loss of Starbucks processing fees, sequential growth was a bit above 10% for the quarter and exceeded guidance the company had given by about 200-300 bps.Clearly, the star of the company's performance last quarter was its growth of 81% in revenues coming from subscriptions and services. These revenues, which are exceptionally profitable, now constitute 21% of total adjusted revenues and have a gross margin of 83%. The two basic reason why SQ has significantly increased its earnings forecast is because a higher proportion of its revenues is coming from more profitable sources and because of successful efforts to moderate the growth of operating expenses. Payment processing is the heart of the company's business - but the profit in software and services is at far greater margins than the profits of payment processingMost of the growth in the subscription and services segment has come from the company's Caviar service, offering meal delivery from many kinds of restaurants such as 2nd Ave. Deli and Red Farm (best Dim Sum in New York in the opinion of this writer - also the most expensive and where else can one find a pastrami egg roll) in Manhattan and Pizzeria Regina in the Boston area. Square Capital is a small loan service offered to the company's sellers and Instant Deposit, a service that gives sellers instant access to funds from sales.How did they do that?Many new IPOs and hyper-growth companies have had a very difficult time in leveraging their business models. Even those investors willing to pay for growth have a hard time in understanding the level of investment necessary to grow revenue. Square has evolved a highly profitable business model far earlier in its history than many thought possible. The company says that it has a payback period of 4-5 quarters in terms of its customer acquisitions and a positive dollar-based retention rate. While the company might present more metrics on the subject, it appears that the service is quite sticky overall, and that most users choose to expand their relationship with Square over the course of time. The emphasis on targeting larger users is one of the factors that has allowed the company to achieve that kind of payback and, of course, it is the larger users who are better candidates for the non-payment services that the company offers. I think the concept of adding customers efficiently and at reasonable cost is a secret sauce that many investors have yet to appreciate.In terms of operating cost metrics, the company has already started to achieve significant progress in its business model.Operating expense ratios improved substantially in Q4 as has been the case for all of 2016. I am going to use adjusted revenues as the denominator in these calculations as I think the GAAP revenue numbers really misrepresent the scale of the company. Passing through the cost of processing credit cards is not part of a real business model.Product development costs fell to 34% of revenues compared to 44% in the prior year. Sales and marketing costs were 25% of revenues compared to 28% in 2015. General and administrative costs are still 28% of revenues, although that is down significantly from 34% in the prior-year period.As mentioned earlier, gross profit margins rose significantly from 81% to 87% as the revenue mix moved more towards subscription and services and away from lower margined transaction based revenues (calculate gross margins based on adjusted revenues and GAAP based gross profits). Transaction and loan losses were $13 million consistent with the levels of Q3 despite higher volumes of both advances and processed payments. The company is using AI technology coupled with the data it has on its sellers to achieve remarkably low loss ratios overall, which hit a new low in 2016.Can they sustain the cadence?This is a company with lots of new products - it is always introducing new products, new services and new integrations. That isn't surprising given the leader of the business is well known both for his beard, his politics and for his focus on technology. The company has many new products that have yet to see mass adoption, including things like payroll, customer loyalty tools, basic analytics and so forth. The growth of the mainstays outside of payments is at very high levels - Square Capital's loan origination rose by 68% last quarter. The company has just introduced its first ""vertical"" solution, POS for Retail.As mentioned in the earnings release, 25% of the revenues the company reported in Q4 2016 came from products that were launched in 2014 and after. So, I think the revenue guide for the current year is likely to prove to be conservative, not so much because the company over-attains its goals for GPV, but because the both new and existing users buy more of the newer solutions and because the loan business continues to grow at rates of nearly 70%. There are some headwinds - the fact is that Q1 last year had a substantial level of revenue from users buying new technology card readers and that will not repeat. And Starbucks revenue is gone now and it represented a few hundred basis points of revenue in the earlier quarters of 2016. But I think 30% top line growth ought to be a minimum expectation and a more realistic forecast ought to be in the mid-30% range.The company has recently introduced POS for Retail which is a service that provides some of the typical benefits that have heretofore been mainly available on far more elaborate and costly retail systems, customized for mid-size retailers as opposed to service providers. It seems likely that the company will also achieve significant revenue contributions from the emphasis it has placed on connectivity, the Square platform (Build with Square) and the development of its eco-system.Overall, subscription and services revenue more than doubled last year and grew by 82% in Q4. It is now 21% of adjusted revenues. It would seem very likely that it will add 1,200-1,500 basis points to the growth rate this year even as the percentage growth of the category rate declines below 60% over the course of the year. So, GPV revenues have to grow at just a bit greater than 20% to achieve the company's forecast and that seems to be a conservative estimate given the 34% rate of growth achieved last quarter and the relatively strong growth of the annual cohorts that management spoke to during the conference call.It is worth noting that payment revenues now include a service offered by Square called Invoices. Last quarter, Square processed $634 million of invoices for its sellers. Invoices is slightly more expensive for sellers than taking a payment with a card reader, but some sellers, particularly those who offer annual service contracts, and keep card numbers on file, like to send online invoices that can be billed to customers on a monthly basis. It is just an example of the ""white space"" opportunities that are not perhaps apparent to investors that Square is penetrating.I do not know to what extent personal experience counts in writing these articles. But when looking around at what management chooses to call ""white space"" it is amazing to this writer places where Square does not do business. For example, Square is not available at all in Puerto Rico where payments technology is dominated by an old-line commercial bank that offers few of the services that users can obtain through Square. Puerto Rico is a US commonwealth whose economy has a plethora of small businesses, many of whom cannot take card payments and most of whom would love to access Square Capital. It is just a small example that I know of personally, but it is an illustration of the potential markets that Square has not yet entered that could bolster GPV growth for years to come. So far, outside the US, Square is available only in Canada, Australia and Japan - the rest of the world would seem to represent a vast opportunity - probably significantly greater than the US for the services the company offers.Management talked about achieving a 400 bps improvement in operating margins/EBITDA over the next year with much of the ""white space"" coming from the general and administrative line. While I would be surprised to see margins improve by 2,000 basis points in 2017 as they did last year, I think they are very likely to grow faster than the forecast. At the least, the changing mix between revenues related to payment volumes to revenues related to software and services is going to have a significant positive impact on margins. Square's strategy is about selling more software and services both to its installed base and to new users. That is going to happen because of the abundance of high value offerings on the platform and because the financing offers are so attractive to Square's customers. Those are very high gross margin revenue streams and will become an increasingly greater amount of the total and that alone can add hundreds of basis points/year to operating margins.Management pointed out that it was using its investments in deep learning and artificial intelligence to help its sellers in terms of support of their customer experience. But most significantly, at least in terms of the P&L, AI is a technique for automating risk analysis and allowing the company to make more and larger loans without augmenting its investment in live credit analysts. It is a significant differentiator in how this company is able to scale its capital advance business and improve operating margins. I think investors continue to undervalue the data insights that Square has in terms of its loans; it is simply not possible for other loan providers to match the quality and quantity of data that Square can access from its customer base. The use of modern machine learning and sophisticated analytics have and will continue to facilitate a major ""cost"" advantage for Square. Square can use its data and analytics to predetermine the level of loan losses that is optimal in its portfolio, something that other lenders are unable to do as they lack some of the insights that come from transaction processing.Square has also made an obvious strategic choice to rein in stock-based comp expense. Stock-based comp increased just 3% year over year in the past quarter and declined by about 7% sequentially. It is still high - it is more than 100% of reported adjusted net income and is forecast to continue to be more than 100% of reported adjusted income this current year but that compares favorably to prior ratios.The company continues to generate a modest amount of cash from operation, again, driven significantly by stock-based comp. The company has continued to fund most of its advances to Square Capital customers through proceeds from sales of its loan portfolio to 3rd party investors. There is no reason, so long as those funds remain available, that the company will not continue to grow its loan portfolio on a consistent basis. CFO Sarah Friar said during the conference call that the company has more potential buyers of loans than it has loans to sell. The combination of very high effective APR that the company charges and its ability to manage risk effectively are such that capital providers are achieving excellent returns from their purchase of Square originated loans.Overall, Square Capital initiated 40,000 loans in Q4, with an aggregate value of $248 million, 68% growth from the value of loan originations in Q4 2015 and unexpected sequential growth from Q3. Square Capital and the company's Instant Access program are exceptionally profitable (I still marvel that some Square sellers will pay the company 1% of the value of a transaction to get access to their funds a day early - but it has been one of the most rapidly growing services offered by the company. Nice work if you can get it, as the song goes), and one reason why I anticipate that the company's ultimate business model is potentially amongst the most profitable in the IT universe.Square's Valuation - A never-ending source of controversyAre Square shares cheap? Can readers invest without closing their eyes to the numbers? I have tried to make the case in this article that investors do have a significant opportunity here and one that should produce substantial positive alpha for some years in the future.I do not think at this point that Square's strategy is in question by too many observers. It has been validated at scale and in many areas over the past year. What is at issue is longer term growth and profitability.For reasons of consistency, I suppose, the published First Call consensus numbers seen on Yahoo Finance relate to reported revenue and to GAAP EPS. Those are not the numbers used by most analysts or investors in looking at the company's valuation or growth rate.Square has forecast it will grow by 30% this year. It has consistently exceeded its growth forecasts during the year it has been public, and looking at its multiple revenue sources, it seems very likely that it will continue to significantly exceed its revenue forecasts. I think one of the difficulties investors, and so far as that is concerned, this writer has in assessing valuation for Square is that it is not a static company. As mentioned earlier, the company is now deriving 25% of its revenues and a significantly greater percentage of its operating profits from services and products that didn't exist 2 years ago. That will continue to happen, I believe, as the company benefits from some of the initiatives that I have tried to write about in this report. The Square about which one writes today is not the Square that will exist 6 months or a year or two years from now and it is difficult to analyze as yet to be announced services and products.But taking a static view, the company currently has 356 million shares outstanding and the current share price is $17.43. So, that computes to a market capitalization of $6.15 billion. The company currently has net cash of $550 million. That yields an enterprise value of about $5.6 billion and based on the company's adjusted revenue forecast for this year of between $880-$900 million, the EV/S calculates to 6.3X. High perhaps, as those things go, but not as high as some other valuations in the IT world.The company's non-GAAP earnings forecast is still very modes, and even if it significantly exceeds the $.15-$.19 of EPS that the company has forecast, no one buying the shares is doing so because of 2017 EPS estimates. As mentioned, stock-based comp has been reined in to some degree at this point, although it will still forecast to be $137 million in 2017, or about 15% of forecast revenues. It is some level of progress.The company, thanks in part to stock-based comp, is cash flow positive as mentioned earlier in the article. For the year, operating cash flow was $23 million, just a bit greater than $21 million attained in 2015.Because this company does have some aspects of a financial institution, as well as elements of an operating software company, many different accounts wash through the CFFO calculation that are not easy to forecast. It seems likely that adjusted EBITDA is going to come closest to CFFO over the course of a full year. Adjusted EBIDA is forecast to grow by $65-$75 million next year. That suggests that operating cash flow could be in the range of about $100 million for the period, although there are many balance sheet items that really cannot be forecasted with any precision a year in advance.CapEx for the company was $37 million last year and probably will rise proportionately to revenues this year. So, a swag at a free cash flow forecast for 2017 would be something in the range of $60 million and that would provide investors with a free cash flow yield of around 1%. Again, no one buying the shares today is doing so because of the company's free cash flow yield based on 2017 estimates.Investors buying SQ shares at the current market price are not and should not be doing so because the typical valuation metrics represent a significant bargain. Of course they do not.One reader of a prior piece I wrote asked me what kind of technology company delivers food? Just like there is technology in dispatching taxis and optimizing fares, there is technology in delivering restaurant meals. But the real strategy behind Caviar… the kind this company offers and not the kind one eats with a little mother of pearl spoons, is that Caviar customers are likely to use SQ to process payments. And they could use SQ services to convert credit card billings to immediate cash flow or they could use Square Capital to buy a piece of capital equipment. They may use SQ to analyze which menu items sell and which don't. They could use SQ for their payroll processing and they could use specific restaurant applications that run on the Square platform which do things such as ordering provisions, take reservations and print bills to present to customers. It is the integration and the multiple services that SQ offers that is the key to Caviar being a fast growing and profitable service for the company.I think that the results of the past quarter are additional evidence that the strategy is working well and will produce significant growth and be profitable in the years ahead. This why I think that the shares are still a buy in the wake of the sharp share price appreciation seen after the earnings call."
4048816,22148,2017-02-23T09:50:28-05:00,Square reported a strong Q4 that beat analyst estimates.The mobile-payments provider faces tough resistance and valuation concerns at new highs.The large share balance remains a containing issue.,"After the close yesterday, Square (NYSE:SQ) reported another strong quarter based on key financial metrics. So far, Jack Dorsey has proven that the mobile-payments provider only needs a part-time CEO to excel.As my previous research highlighted, Square faces tough resistance above $15 and valuation concerns around the all-time high near $16. Will the after-hour price hold and send the stock to new highs?The market has always wrongfully questioned the ability of the company to leverage sales growth. Square was aggressively spending to capture a large and growing market so profits weren't the original goal of the company.The Q4 report provides solid proof that the mobile payments leader can add customers without breaking the bank and turn into a very profitable payments provider in the future. Though the stock constantly runs into a couple of issues that play against investors not doing the correct research.The primary news is that Square beat analyst estimates by a wide $0.05. The key is that the company produced adjusted revenue growth of $57 million and boosted adjusted EBITDA by an incredible $36 million. Square will go far by dropping that percentage of incremental revenues to the bottom line.Investors focusing on gross payment volumes or net revenue during 2016 probably missed the improving investment story. Due to the end of the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) contract and pass-through transactions costs, the key revenue metric was always adjusted revenues. For the quarter, those revenues grew 43% to $192 million. The new revenues only grew 21%, but don't reflect the true growth at Square.Source: Square Q416 shareholder letterThe company continues branching off into new growth areas from shifting towards larger sellers with annual GPV in excess of $500K to lending customers capital to allowing payments via a web browser that added $40K in GPV alone for January. In total, products launched since 2014 represent 25% of net revenues during Q4.So besides the company clicking on just about every financial metric and having a management team delivering new products, the dilute share count provides a huge hidden problem. Square listed the share count for 2016 up at 370 million shares while most sites use a share count of 350 million.The reality is that Square went public with a fully diluted share count of around 450 million shares. The after-hours price places the market cap at $7.3 billion.The 2017 adjusted revenue guidance is up to $900 million placing the stock trading in after hours at about 8.2x sales estimates. At an adjusted EBITDA target of $100 million, Square trades at over 70x that estimate.The key investor takeaway is that Square could reach new highs in trading Thursday. The stock doesn't offer much appeal at these levels."
4034012,98236,2017-01-03T13:55:45-05:00,"Square has been gaining some significant new and positive analyst coverage.Many investors and observers are still unclear about the vision of the company's founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey.The company is based on a foundation of complementary streams of revenue and profit far beyond its payment processing services.SQ's opportunity to finance its sellers and to provide them with instantaneous access to cash is in its infancy.The company's Caviar restaurant delivery service has started to generate gross margins and is also likely to be dragging along significant levels of other sales of Square products and services.","Square's maturing value proposition for its usersSquare (NYSE:SQ) remains a bit of an enigma to many potential investors. How, I have been asked, could a company that is engaged in payment processing and in delivering meals be considered a tech vendor? When many observers look at SQ what they see, after they consider CEO Jack Dorsey's bushy face hair, is a company that provides its users with mobile payment service. While Square may have been first in that field, these days, there is plenty of competition. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) offers a similar service with significant levels of customer support. So, does Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU). Why consider a company like this as an investment? How can Square possibly build a competitive moat?One thing that I think is important to note is that Square is, to a greater or lesser extent, a reflection of CEO Jack Dorsey's vision. Jack Dorsey is a controversial figure both in the investment world and in the political arena. Obviously, the current inability of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to find a successful place in the firmament has disheartened many investors and has perhaps tarnished the ability of Square to be judged on its own. And I think it is important to understand that Mr. Dorsey's vision for Square is rather complex and is composed of several intertwined elements. For example, I doubt that most other companies situated as Square would be selling hardware with the level of loss that Mr. Dorsey accepts. And it has been well rumored that some people in the Square organization had been pushing to sell the Caviar restaurant delivery service.I am not greatly concerned with Mr. Dorsey's politics. He lives in the Bay area and his view almost certainly reflect the consensus of his environment. Because he runs Twitter, some of those views will make it into the public domain. But I think it is important for investors to understand that making a commitment to Square shares is certainly making a commitment to Mr. Dorsey's vision. I will interpret it the best that I can. But it is nowhere near as simple as perceived by many casual observers.As I will write at a more granular level further on in this article, the fact is that not each and every piece of the Square offering is either unique or cocooned behind an impenetrable moat. But the company's offerings have evolved, viewed holistically, and are far more unique than recognized. The Square platform does represent potential value to users and that value is under-appreciated by observers in terms of the revenue and earnings estimates they have made and the price targets they have assigned.One sees many predictions about 2017 at this time of the year. Obviously one of the more frequent predictions is which stock will perform best. Square has only been public a bit over a year now-but for reasons that I will attempt to elucidate, I think that the shares are likely to do particularly well this coming year as some of the company's many initiatives start to reach the scale where they produce significant profits. At the moment, Square's valuation metrics, particularly considering more realistic expectations, seem reasonable. But companies like Square can often wind up selling for valuations that mystify or enrage investors looking to find deep value names.Again, in looking at valuation metrics, it is smart to look at adjusted revenues. The company has forecasted adjusted revenues this year to be around $680 million. I think a reasonable estimate for 2017 revenues is probably around $890 million, although that is not necessarily the estimate that the company will use when it first guides 2017. The company currently has a market capitalization of about $4.7 billion and a total cash balance of a bit more than $560 million. The company's enterprise value is thus around $4.14 billion. So, the EV/S is about 4.65X.The company generates positive cash flow although more than all of that amount is a function of stock based compensation which is running at more than 20% of adjusted revenues. But, at current levels, no investor is buying shares of Square because of either its reported earnings-which are still in the future or its CFFO which is hard to forecast and certainly not large enough to justify a share purchase yet. As I comment on later in this article, this company has a far clearer and speedier path to profitability than other high-growth businesses to which it is sometimes compared to.I have written about this company several times on SA. The shares have not quite returned to the price they achieved at the time of my initial article in April. They have, however, appreciated about 12% in 2016 which was far better than many other peer vendors. 12% may not sound like much but it is actually a bit better than the IGV index which rose by 7% and the 8% gain of the QQQ index last year. And it is far better than lots of other so-called tech ""unicorns"".The company has recently attracted a fair amount of positive attention. In the last couple of months before the turn of the year, the company received three new buy recommendation and also had the benefit of three upgrades from fairly well known brokers.Still, however, there is lots of healthy skepticism on the part of covering analysts regarding the prospects for this company. Amongst the 25 banks offering recommendations, 14 rate it a buy or a strong buy, while the other 11 call it a hold. And the price target is consensus price target is just a bit over $14 compared to the current share price which is just $.50 lower.There is a relatively significant disconnect between analyst estimates and what reality is likely to be. In particular, the 24% revenue growth estimate shown by Yahoo Finance as the 1st Call consensus is likely to be substantially over-attained. This will be, in part, because the 1st Call is looking at the wrong revenue estimate (one has to look at adjusted revenues which exclude revenue from Starbucks and the cost of payment processing that is essentially passed through in terms of GAAP revenues). And I imagine that the current earnings consensus is going to be substantially shattered by the results in this year as well. It would not surprise me to see the company show a breakeven Q4 when it reports numbers sometime in early March. I think that will precipitate estimate revisions and, perhaps, some more broker upgrades as well.Of course, In terms of addressing recent events at Square, I am compelled to mention the CEO's 10b5-1 plan and the share sales that were reported at the end of 2016. Jack Dorsey owns just shy of 70 million shares of the business (20%) and his 10b5-1 plan encompasses 7% of that amount or potentially 5 million shares. He sold 381,000 of the 5 million shares in the plan just before the end of 2016 in an automatic transaction.The potential benefits of being a Square customerI think in evaluating the prospects of Square in 2017, and beyond, it is smart to analyze how the company has been able to grow. No one enjoys surrendering 2.7% of their hard-made sales just to get the money from their customers into their bank account. While it is hard to evaluate differing pricing options with precision, it doesn't appear as though Square's success is a function of its pricing as it is not the lowest cost provider in its space.For many users, Square offers faster access to funds than alternative mobile payment solutions. And even for users who do not take advantage of the company's services, it is apparently a significant comfort in choosing a vendor to know that Square offers loans, hardware, software and instant access to the proceeds from sales processed through its service. There are plenty of small business loan alternatives available, although almost all of them have what seem like prohibitively high interest rates. What SQ offers that is somewhat unique is the ability to borrow a small amount of money secured by nothing more than a merchant account on Square that is repaid through customer payments. And SQ offers the ability to get immediate access to the funds generated by customer payments. For many smaller merchants and those aspiring start ups, access to the kind of credit that SQ facilitates as part of its payment processing scheme is a lifeline that can be the difference between the success and the failure of a business. Under those circumstances, it is perhaps easier to understand why SQ has been able to dominate its category even when its technology and customer service may seem average. (I am sure there are a variety of opinions on these subjects. Customer service is a subjective area and Square is investing money to improve what had been a weak point a couple of years ago. Management is very proud of the speed with which it can process a transaction-less than 5 seconds-and has set a further aspirational goal. How significant it will be to process a transaction in less than 5 seconds is something I will leave to others to debate.)The largest single benefit that SQ offers users is its eco-system, and that is a moat that is hard to cross. Most small businesses haven't either the time or the expertise to operate multiple non-integrated IT systems. The poster child for a Square deployment is a customer who uses SQ to process payments and the other solutions that manage payroll, prepare customer invoices, develop loyalty apps, and other kinds of CRM functionality useful for small businesses. A couple of these kinds of customers are highlighted every quarter in the company's quarterly earnings release.It is somewhat unusual to see a relatively small vendor offer developers a platform which they can launch their own solutions. Last quarter, Square starting supporting two points of sale solutions, TouchBistro for restaurants and Vend for retail. There is something of a virtuous cycle here. That is that the larger Square's installed base, the more developers are interested in providing solutions to integrate into the Square platform and, the more solutions there are on the Square platform, the easier it becomes for Square to recruit additional merchants.The company sells some hardware, most notably its chip card readers. It's hardware will sooner or later be emulated for a lower price by a competitor. But as it is obvious to many observers, Square sells hardware to help increase its moat. It has a large negative gross margin on hardware; in fact, the negative margin on hardware represents 50% of the company's non-GAAP operating loss. But again, selling hardware at a loss seems to be a reasonable way of attracting sellers as opposed to spending more dollars on sales and marketing.Delivering restaurant meals-It's all about the platform and the eco-systemNotionally, delivering restaurant meals would seem the last thing a customer involved in processing payments and trying to build a platform and an eco-system would want to do. Square bought Caviar a little more than 2 years ago for $90 million. The company has reputedly fielded offers from Uber and GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and perhaps Yelp (NYSE:YELP) although the offers were said to be lowball-and a transaction obviously hasn't happened. In December, Square bought a Philadelphia based restaurant delivery service called Main Line Delivery despite the fact that it already had a significant presence in the area with 300 restaurant sellers.There are some analysts who think that owning Caviar serves to dilute the attention of management and to depress the valuation that investors are willing to pay. And there are rumors that Square management agrees that Caviar is a distraction.During its last earnings release, however, management highlighted the performance of Caviar which it said had grown 11X in weekly order volume since Square acquired the company. Gokul Rajaram, the head of the Caviar business unit, said that Caviar is currently making money on every order which suggests that it has been able to profitably leverage its growth.But the strategy behind owning a food delivery service is not to try to ring out gross margins in a hotly competitive space where other vendors may be able to deliver meals more efficiently.The concept behind Caviar is the benefit it gives Square. It allows them to sell a multiplicity of solutions to restaurants. Obviously, to the extent that restaurants contract with Square to deliver their meals, they are a prime candidate to use the company's core mobile payment technology, both in their restaurant and in other remote locations they operate. Square reported that the annualized payment volume for a seller that uses both Square and Caviar is greater than $500,000 and, at that level, the profitability of the payment business is quite high.But restaurants also have needs in terms of payroll process, inventory management, loyalty programs and so forth. As mentioned earlier, one of the first developers with an application running on Square's platform is TouchBistro. According to 3rd party research on the subject, TouchBistro is the best POS system for restaurants. While Square, itself offers a POS system, it is far more attractive to have users buy from TouchBistro while using Square to process payments. And of course, if a user is already working with Square for much of their ""back of the house"" technology, they become a prime candidate to use Square Capital for various kinds of loans including the instant deposit feature.Synergy is a concept that is overworked in business and in business management casebooks and probably in my writing as well. But the fact is that Square is all about a platform, an eco system and synergies. As I point out in my next segment, Square's path to profitability is far better illuminated than many other vendors because of the synergies that it has available.Synergies and the art of aggregationOne of the first things an analyst is trained to do, or at least such was the case years ago was to disaggregate an income statement so it could be analyzed. Does a company have a hidden gem or is its business model fatally flawed? IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) are prime examples of companies who have serious flaws that come to light when one carefully considers the disaggregation of their revenue streams.The most obvious example of this is the synergy between Square Capital and the Square payment processing business. Square Capital is completely dependent on Square payment processing to find its customers. Its special sauce is that it costs almost nothing for Square Capital to acquire customers, and it is able to make loan decisions both more quickly and more effectively than bank rivals who do not have the ability to use a company's own revenues as security for a loan. Given that Square raises 3rd party capital to fund its loans (merchant cash advances), and that it can service loans from its own payment platform, Square has invented one of the more potentially lucrative undertakings in the IT world. While Square Capital's APR on its loans is high, the implied APR on the instant deposit option is remarkable. The CFO called it a high margin product since it is able to charge 1% for overnight access to money, which is as good as it gets.While there is a strong temptation to simply look at the opportunities Square has in loaning other people's money to its sellers at extraordinary rates of interest, the fact is that it really does offer a host of technologies that most of its customers will find useful. In aggregate, the company sold $35 million of what it calls software and data products. Most of that revenue is from Capital, Caviar and Instant Deposit, but the opportunities that this company has to sell just pure software is substantial. It is far easier for potential users to contract with Square for their requirements in terms of payroll, CRM and analytics than it is to try to select different products from different users and try to integrate the results.Again, there is a huge amount of software designed and sold to SMB's and it hard for most users to choose between all of the different offerings. There is nothing in Square's software solutions that is particularly unique or cutting edge but it is easier and cheaper together, at least in terms of the total cost of ownership.The Path to Profitability-A Road Less TraveledWhen I write about the crop of unicorns that have become public or about the many tech companies that have yet to reach profitability, I am often asked what is the path to profitability? One of Square's investment attributes is that its path to profitability is quite clearly delineated. There are several specific avenues that should lead the company to a significant and sustained level of profitability.At the current time, most of Square's adjusted revenues (about 76%) come from the fees it charges to process payments. Those fees grew by 35% year on year last quarter and are up by 36% year to date. GAAP product development costs were up by 27% last quarter and GAAP sales and marketing costs were up by 18%. So, there is a significant amount of leverage already being seen in the model. General and Administrative costs rose by 37% last quarter-more a function of the staffing necessary to support the rapid growth of Square Capital and Caviar.The basic concern for most observers of Square have is the potential for pricing to deteriorate. So far, that simply hasn't happened and, if anything, it seems that pricing has been a net positive. There has been a visible swing to larger seller's year on year and larger sellers get better pricing. (break-points start at $250,000 year of payments) Square's largest sellers who exceed $500k/year in transactions have increased from 11% to 14% of revenue and the second tier if sellers who process between $125k-$500k in annual volume increased from 26% to 28% of total GPV. So, the ability that the company has had to maintain its take rates at around 2.93% actually is indicative of what appears to be a benign pricing environment despite the fact that it is well known that Square is not the lowest cost payment processing offering.The larger sellers turn out to be more likely to buy additional software from Square and to utilize both Square Capital and Instant Deposit. While there is no scientific way to determine these things, it seems likely that Square customers are willing to pay premium prices so they can get the features that the company offers both directly and through its eco-system. As the average Square seller becomes larger, the profitability of an average account increases since there are no incremental costs in terms of processing larger transactions.The company is building out its customer support function which was said to be substandard a couple of years ago. But again, based on the numbers as reported, customer support costs are growing more slowly than the revenues the company is generating from transaction processing. Support basically requires a significant level of initial investment but has almost imperceptible marginal costs above certain break-points. Larger customers simply have fewer outages per dollar of revenue generation when compared to smaller customers.As mentioned earlier, the company has been willing to accept significant gross margin losses on hardware. Management said in its quarterly earnings presentation that selling the contactless card reader brought new sellers into the ecosystem because the product had superior functionality to the other readers on the market. It is probably both less expensive and increases account stickiness to sell card readers at a loss than it would be to discount basic services.At this point, the biggest potential profit spinners for this company are Instant Deposit and Square Capital, probably followed by Caviar. The company has not revealed its deals with 3rd party capital sources who actually fund most of its advances.At the end of the quarter the company only had $28 million of loans it held as an asset on its balance sheet. It wound up selling $393 million of the $421 million of the loans it made during the first 9 months of the year. Basically Square Capital is a new business so it is not terribly surprising that its general and administrative costs, where the costs of its risk analysis/loan approval function are recorded, rose by 38% YoY. Perhaps at some point, the company will start to break out its costs into buckets that have to do with Square Capital and those costs that are typically considered to be general and administrative.We do not know the profit parameters of Caviar. As mentioned earlier, because of the huge growth in volume, albeit from a very small base, it has started to enjoy positive gross margins. We do not know just what proportion of the delivery accounts have signed up with Square for payment processing or have installed Square supported POS such as TouchBistro. And we have no idea as to the penetration of Square's software products with its Caviar customers although it is self-evident that restaurants need and deploy both payroll and CRM capabilities in significant volume. And of course, we don't know the proportion of Caviar customers who have become customers for either Instant Deposit or for Square Capital loans. But it seems very likely that Caviar, besides generating a positive gross margin, is also starting to drive meaningful levels of revenues for other Square products and services.In the short-term (i.e. the results for the quarter that ended last week), I expect that Square is likely to post another beat. Square's revenues are closely tied to the volume of its sellers and the volume of its sellers is highly likely to have increased significantly in the holiday influenced quarter. The company is forecasting that its adjusted revenue will rise to $183 million at a mid-point. While this is a significant increase in expectations from prior guidance, it should be noted that adjusted revenues were $178 million in Q3. Almost certainly, Square has continued to add net new customers and the customers it is adding are almost certainly larger in payment volume than its current average. And it would be surprising, at least to me, if the other elements of revenue such as Capital, Caviar and instantaneous deposit did not show meaningful sequential increases. So, my guess is that the company is likely to have another meaningful beat and that, in turn, will have positive impacts on both operating margins and on cash flow.The path to profitability for Square is more of a very broad highway that is built on selling multiple complementary services to a rising volume of larger sellers. It is at least as good a strategy as any other I have seen amongst the newer companies in the IT space. It is fundamentally the reason why I think Square shares should be able to generate positive alpha in 2017."

4033601,102228,2017-01-01T04:20:37-05:00,"After writing my Square Inc. piece centering around their lending platform in mid-October of 2016, shares have tacked on an impressive 27.5%.It hasn't been a volatile run; even after outstanding earnings result, shares in the payment processor have ground higher in nearly a perfectly straight line.Why has the market come around to the story? What does the street see now that they didn't see in early October?In this article, I will try and determine if anything has changed at Square Inc. to cause the move higher and see if shares can continue higher.","When I wrote my Square Inc. (NYSE:SQ) article regarding their small business loan division found here, I was still writing like I would write reports for the Portfolio Managers at the funds I worked. In hindsight, I appreciate everyone who took the time to read that article cover to cover; it had nearly 5k words and was probably not a very easy read. I guess at the very least I hope those who read it became the expert on Square's SME lending platform and the SME lending marketplace that I am now and they did very well with their SQ shares. I'm actually in the process of generating a track-record for a Seeking Alpha Marketplace service with 10 friends using my service. SQ shares were one of my picks, and my test subs are still long the shares with a $13.50 stop as of 12/30/2016.Enough with the victory laps, why did Square shares start grinding higher all of a sudden? And more importantly to the reader, can it continue? Even before Q3 2016 ER on Nov. 1st, 2016, I started to see some things that I liked in a name beside the fundamentals. I saw Steven Cohen of Point 72 building a position larger than 5%, meaning he would have to disclose his movements, at least until he was under 5%. I saw some absolute massive options prints in the December 2016 call options and some decent flow in the January 2017 calls as well. On a technical basis, I saw shares that were being supported by the 200DMA and then I saw another round of short-term options bets, on the call side in November. All these data points and the fact I liked the name on a fundamental basis was enough to coerce me to build a 20% position in SQ shares.Was I 100% confident going into the print? No way I was, shares in Square were 30% lower just 3 months earlier, if things were bad, it could have gone back there or even lower. I've learned to take notice when I see big options prints; you have to take care and make sure they are on the ask if you are looking to get long. When a market player or a group of investors paper stocks (trade a lot of options) like they did in SQ, they usually have a good reason. Square Inc. had a very solid Q3 print no doubt, but did it come out of left field? I don't think it did, many on the street thought earnings would be solid. So what changed that caused investors to bid the shares higher? And can it continue?What Changed?Square was always cheap, at least compared to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), the biggest player on the block on a revenue basis. Square was using the oft utilized strategy of trying to grow the company at all costs and figure out the earnings later, at least until the last two quarters. Let's see what changed.Focus on Earnings:Square threw a lot of us for a loop with their positive EBITA guidance. I thought I would have to think of Square as a growth company for years into the future and use alternative valuation metrics. Square now thinks they will generate $31-33mm of adjusted EBITA in 2016, up from $18-24mm the prior quarter. You probably are well aware how much more people spend in Q4 vs. all other quarters. I think Square is super conservative with their Q4 guidance and the actual EBITA figure will end up significantly higher. You'll probably say ""yeah, but Square is worth $5bn, its EV/EBITA is still 125 even if they do beat that number"". Sure, that's expensive, but for a company growing revenue at a 50% clip, it's pretty impressive they are even generating any EBITA.When you are growing by leaps and bounds, you're usually better off plowing every dollar you can back into the company. Hyper growth like that doesn't come around very often; when you have it you need to capitalize on that growth. Maybe investors just liked the idea they were profitable on an EBITA basis that sent shares higher. There are investment shops that have weird rules including rules stating they only invest in positive EBITA companies. Square's EBITA number might have thrust its shares into more funds' ""investable universe."" Clearly, EBITA moving in the right direction is one of the reasons the stock went from neutral to drive.Square Capital:I spoke a great deal about the opportunity that Square Capital presented on my last SQ article. To put it lightly, Square Capital is en Fuego. Revenue in the Software and Data Products segment in which Square Capital sits was up 140% YoY. We know Caviar, which also sits in that segment, is not lighting the world on fire, so it's safe to say most of this growth likely comes from Square Capital and Instant Deposit revenue. Instant Deposit is a clever little business in its own right. Think of it as a payday loan type of business just not nearly as scummy. It takes time to process payments and the business to get the revenue physically. If a business needs the cash from a credit or debit card sale they just made, Square will provide that cash for a 1% fee.I wrote in detail in my last article about Square Capital, but to summarize, it is a sweet little business. They have so much information on the people they are lending to, and at the current moment, they are having no trouble finding capital to fund the loans they provide. Square extended $208mm in loans during Q3 2016; they haven't even scratched the surface as in my last article I calculated the addressable market at $200bn per year. Square doesn't break out below the line where profits came from, but we know on a net basis margins are 65% in Software and Data vs. 35% in their core transaction business. I'd wager a great deal of that EBITA beat came from the Software and Data division, but I'll likely never know. If Square Capital were making SQ shares rise because of some industry re-rating, I'd expect shares of OnDeck Capital (NYSE:ONDK) to be ripping higher as well, it hasn't been. I spoke in my last article about the superior position Square is in on the data side vs. an OnDeck or an Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) in the SME lending division; it would appear they are using this position of power. I fully expect Square Capital to be a bigger driver, at least on the earnings side to Square in the future. There is simply no player in the market with data on their clients better than Square; they will be capitalizing on this well into the future.The Big are Getting Bigger:YoY growth of GPV (gross payment volume) in the 3rd quarter of 2016 was 39% in aggregate, very respectable growth. YoY GPV growth from larger sellers was 55%, and Square earned the same margins on these accounts than they did the smaller accounts. I'm a small player, I've worked for small funds (even when I worked for a $700mm Hedge fund it was ""small"" compared to many players), and I want to start a small marketplace shortly. I'll be battling people with large established bases when I get up and running. Everywhere you look in the market, with retailers or even on a professional sports team, you tend to see one thing over and over; the big are getting bigger.Square was built to give EVERYONE access to credit and debit card readers. Hosting a garage sale? You can accept cards now. Have a $30-40k per year coffee stand? Most payments processors wouldn't have picked up the phone until Square came to the market. The Square reader presents many benefits vs. a traditional payment terminal. Trying to figure out at what times you are generating more revenue? Just look at Square's software, it will break down when you are generating the bulk of your sales allowing you to schedule more employees at these times. Does an old VeriFone (NYSE:PAY) terminal have that capability? Only if you purchase another layer of costly software will a VeriFone terminal report data with that level of detail. With Square, that's just part of their deal.Because of this efficiency, small sellers are becoming big sellers and big sellers are becoming even bigger. I've been to department stores recently when they were busy; when things get busy, all salespeople can also be checkout clerks with nothing more than their smartphone in their pocket and a Square dongle. Large companies like the mobility, they like the integration, and they love Squares Customer Engagement features. I don't think Wall Street ever thought large companies would adopt a processor like Square. Most large companies use their size to get the cheapest processing deal they possibly can acquire. Square has shown that their very system has value and larger enterprises are voting with their feet. That large seller GPV growth caught the Street off guard; I don't see the big getting bigger trend slowing down anytime soon. Unfortunately for me, I guess I'll just have to work on getting really big.They Opened their API and Partners are Using it:Companies like having ownership of their systems. By opening Square's API to growing businesses, they allow companies to move away from the systems Square built but allows Square to process the actual payment still. A good example of this in the recent integration of TouchBistro and Vend two POS system that catered to restaurants. Would you want your waiter or waitress running your check at the table with a phone? Probably not, it would completely kill the vibe. Vend and Touch Bistro has taken all the unique needs a restaurant has and effectively built it on top of Square's payment system. They can still split checks, discount items and comp a desert like they normally would, functionality just not built into Square. When the payment is processed, it goes through Square's network.Maybe that restaurant is throwing a large X-Mas party on Saturday and needs to buy the food and drinks for the party. Because the system was built on Square, they would still have access to Square Instant Deposit to bring sales from the week into their bank account to make the purchases they need to host the party. Lots of different businesses have unique POS needs; they can either build their own and still process through Square or they can use a system built specifically for their industry that also happens to use Square on the backend. They'll still get access to Deposit, Capital and Analytics, they just have a system that works better than the one size fits all package Square provides. Few companies are so open with their API; they usually want full control and they want to trap users into their ecosystems. By opening their ecosystem, Square effectively leaves no stone unturned in their search to process payments for, well, everyone. I think the street is starting to realize the value in this proposition and getting large players like TouchBistro (1bn in annual transactions as of 2015) and Vend (crossing 1bn in GMV run rate in 2016) have impressed the street.It would appear, Sarah Friar, the CFO of Square, wasn't just paying lip service on her ""executing on all cylinders"" statement. Wall Street has come around to the story, but if you look on a YTD basis, shares are only up 12.5%. However, from lows in July, though, SQ shares are up nearly 70%, that's where things get scary. So the question is can this rise continue?Where to now?:Square is a large company with a $5bn market cap. PayPal added $7bn in market cap alone in 2016, so though Square has a lot of catching up to do, it still sits on fertile grounds. The US GDP is $16-18 trillion depending on the study at which you are looking. 70% of that is consumer driven or approximately $12 trillion. Of that $12 trillion, about $2.4-.7 trillion is transacted using cards or a hair above 20%. Typically, when looking at growth opportunities for investment purposes, you don't start to worry until penetration starts getting close to 50%. I typically start to take notice around 40-45%.This growth lesson was a lesson I learned in the hardest of ways, losing a lot of money. I was involved in a company that made smartphone guts, and as smartphone penetration got near 50%, the market decided the company I was long would be re-rated. Re-ratings tend to happen in what seems like a straight line. My point is we are nowhere close to 50%, we are only going to use cards or are smartphones directly (Square is on board there too) more in the future. Square has a long way to go until electronic payments are penetrated at the 40% level where I would start to question future growth.More payments processed in Square's network benefits the company two ways. One, they make money processing the payment, easy to understand. Two, as more people use Square processing, Square has more data about their customers, as they get more data they can extend more loans or give more customers Instant Deposits. Square could potentially operate the payments business at break even and make all their money in the higher margin Software and Data division (however, I don't think they'll do this). I see quite a bit of runway for Square's fundamentals, so to answer the question regarding if this can continue, I believe it can. Let's look what SQ's technicals look like right now:SQ Technicals:See the attached chart of SQ shares for the last 13 months:(Source: stockcharts.com)You can probably get a good idea why I currently have a $13.50 stop in place on my SQ position. $13.50 proved as both resistance and support in the past, and when shares went through that level on this last run, they effectively ""broke-out."" SQ shares have left all their moving averages and trend lines in the dust. If shares form a right shoulder, it will be cause for concern for longs, at least in the short term as this doesn't look like a big formation. As long as $13.50 holds on the downside and $15.50 holds on the upside, SQ shares look to be range bound until shares can clear $15.50. A move through $15.50 would indicate a large breakout and would likely get some momentum behind it. With all this in mind, if you are not currently long shares of SQ where would you look to get long? I think for the time being you should wait and see what happens if shares do end up testing the $13.50 level. If shares start to go higher past $15, you also probably want to get long for a potential large breakout at $15.50. For the time being, I'm keeping my shares and my $13.50 stop. If we lose $13.50, I'll sell half my position as at 20%; SQ is a large position for me.Conclusion:The market is finally giving some respect that Square Inc. deserves. The dual CEO role and the fact that Jack Dorsey is not looked on very favorably is probably still weighing on SQ shares. Not only is Square a fast growing company but now it's also profitable, a very rare combo for hyper growth Silicon Valley companies. Investors should be preparing for a much bigger breakout above the $15.50 level. Investors who are already long should take care to make sure a winning position doesn't turn out to be a losing position, but both current longs and potential longs need to prepare for higher prices. If $13.50 holds with conviction, I would get long shares. Square's Q4 2016 print should be nothing short of fantastic and I would expect Wall Street to pay further attention to the story. Square is the type of company you want to hold for a long time if you can. Payments technology will be in flux for the foreseeable future, and not many companies are as geared to this change as Square is. Square Capital is another lever the company can pull, and if the US doesn't see a significant recession anytime soon, this segment could be a potential rocket ship. The pullback in Square's shares is an opportunity; investors should stand ready to benefit from it. In 2-3 years time, Square will be much larger than it already is if it's still an independent company. Out of Jack Dorsey's two babies, I believe it's an easy choice; Square is where investors should be looking."

        A bullish opportunity exists in the leader of the mobile credit card space, Square, and its ability to continually diversify and innovate within and outside the payment niche.
        One of the hallmarks of long-term successful technologies companies is the ability to improve and morph with never ending change. Square has proven its mettle many times in this regard.","By David GoodboyThe primary way investors create long-term wealth in the stock market is by riding trends. I am not talking about price trends but rather the overall societal and technological macro-trends that come together to change the world.Trillions of dollars have been made by identifying these macro trends and purchasing shares in companies riding them. The trick is identifying companies that are leaders in their niche -- the companies that possess the momentum and fortitude to withstand resistance to change, and are the first movers into the space. These three fundamental factors are what distinguish long-term winners in the stock market.One major macro societal and technological trend right now is the move to a mobile society. This trend is driven by the ubiquitous use of smartphones powered by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other companies in the space. We are all familiar with the fortunes that were made by those who jumped aboard this trend as early investors.The trend toward making everything mobile has also led to the development of various sub-trends. One of the most exciting and world changing sub-trends is the move toward decoupling the transfer of money from banks and other traditional financial institutions to upstart technology firms. Companies like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have led this revolution.Right now, another revolution in the money transfer space is underway. This revolution, built upon the infrastructure developed for mobile devices, is changing the way merchants accept credit cards. No longer are retailers required to purchase expensive credit card processing equipment and submit to an often rigorous approval process. Today, nearly anyone with a smartphone can accept credit cards. No matter how small or new the business, any merchant with a bank account and smartphone can receive payments via credit card.Right now a bullish opportunity exists in the leading company in the mobile credit card space Square (NYSE:SQ).Co-founded by Jack Dorsey, who was also the co- founder and CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Square's mission is to simplify commerce between buyers and sellers.The company is part of the huge market of credit card processing. The U.S. card processing market is about $10 trillion in annual size and Square only has around one half of 1% of the pie so far! This is despite the company growing by over 500% in the last several years, according to their investor presentation.To give you an idea of the massive growth of Square, consider this: Gross payment volume ramped higher by 52% year over year in the second quarter of 2015. The growth continued to accelerate into the second quarter of 2016 with a 42% gain year over year. Adjusted revenue has also kept up the bullish pace with 65% year over year growth in the second quarter of 2015 and 54% in the same quarter 2016. I expect this growth to continue for the next several years.Square is continually diversifying and innovating within and outside the payment niche. One of the most exciting -- and likely profitable -- recent partnerships is the one with Upserve. Upserve is a restaurant technology company with over 7,000 restaurant clients who use the company's software to manage over 20 million meals per month. Currently, more than 2% of all restaurant sales run on Upserve payments. Square Capital, which provides funding for small businesses, will allow Upserve clients the ability to select loan offers built into their existing suite of restaurant software.The partnership solves a very real need that many restaurants struggle with: finding easier access to capital. And this is just one example of Square's active expansion efforts.Unlike most other companies, Square designs both its software and hardware in house. This provides a serious edge to Square since it can quickly optimize its entire system without waiting for others. One vexing issue solved by Square's unique position is card reader speed. The company is continually reducing card reader speed with an ultimate goal of three seconds. A recent speed reduction of 25% to just over four seconds reveals Square is well on its way to the goal. Also, Square has quickly morphed to embrace the shift to chip cards. Currently, over 75% of all cards processed via Square contain chips.One of the hallmarks of long-term successful technologies companies is the ability to improve and morph with never ending change. Square has proven its mettle many times in this regard.Risks To Consider: Square is on the forefront of the mobile payment revolution. However, it is critical to note that competition from upstarts as well as embedded technology companies. Despite having an enormous first mover advantage, the competitive risk is very real for all technology companies.Action To Take: Shares have found support at the 200-day simple moving average setting up an ideal buy opportunity. Earnings are expected to be released on November 1, and I expect a solid estimate beat with shares breaking out higher. Buy now at $11.25 with initial stops set at $9.23 per share and a target price of $17.00 per share.This article was originally posted on StreetAuthority.com."

Earlier this week, Square reported its third-quarter results, which overshot market expectations. Despite the beat, though, the stock is still valued significantly short of its pre-listing valuation.Square's FinancialsFor the third quarter, Square's revenues grew 32% over the year to $439 million, compared with the Street's expectations of $430 million. Its platform processed $13.2 billion of gross payment volume, recording 39% growth over the year. Excluding Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) revenues, Square's revenues grew 51% over the year to $178 million, compared with market estimates of $172.6 million for the quarter. Loss per share reduced from $0.35 a year ago to $0.09 for the quarter and was better than the market forecast loss of $0.11 per share.By segment, Transaction revenues grew 38% over the year to $388.3 million. Software and data product revenues increased 140% to $35.3 million, driven by growth in Square Capital, Caviar and Instant Deposit revenue. Hardware revenue in the quarter grew 94% to $8.2 million. Starbucks transaction revenues fell to $7.2 million.Square's efforts to upsell itself to the bigger businesses appear to be working, albeit slowly. During the quarter, GPV from larger sellers, which are defined as those generating more than $125,000 in annualized GPV, grew 55% year over year and accounted for 43% of GPV in the third quarter of 2016. A quarter ago, that number stood at 42% of GPV.For the current quarter, Square expects revenues of $438-443 million and adjusted revenue to be in the range of $182-185 million. It expects to end the year with revenues of $1.695-1.7 billion and adjusted revenues of $677-680 million. The Street was looking for revenues of $1.68 billion for the year.Square's New OfferingsSquare's success can be attributed to its continuing product innovation. Last quarter, it launched a new offering called Scheduled Deposit to make it easier for sellers to access their funds. The service allows sellers to preset the days of the week that they would like to receive the funds on. Scheduled Deposit is an added feature of the Instant Deposit capability that Square had launched last year. Instant Deposit allows sellers to deposit up to $2,500 per deposit instantly. Since the launch of the service, 200,000 sellers have completed nearly 4 million instant deposits.Additionally, Square also launched the feature Register Card on File to allow sellers the ability to safely store and charge their customers' cards in Square Register. The enhancement allows sellers to accelerate the check-out process, especially for their most frequent customers.Square and CaviarMeanwhile, Square is trying to reshuffle its portfolio by selling off its food delivery service, Caviar. Square had acquired Caviar in August of 2014 for $90 million. Since the acquisition, Square has grown the Caviar business. Weekly order volume has grown more than 11 times, and the average annualized GPV of a seller who uses both Square and Caviar is greater than $500,000. Square also has benefited by leveraging Caviar's customers to expand its reach within the restaurant segment. But the food delivery business is now extremely competitive with the likes of UberEats (NYSE:UBER) and GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB). Analysts estimate that Caviar is losing money, though the volume of the losses is not known.According to market reports, Square has attempted to sell Caviar to Uber, GrubHub and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) for an estimated $100 million. But it hasn't received any bids at that price. It will continue to look for a potential buyer or it will have to take a beating on the asking price.It has been a full year since Square went public. Prior to listing, the company had attained a $6 billion valuation. Currently, it is trading at $11.07 with a market cap of $3.58 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $15.91 in March this year and has recovered from the 52-week low of $8.06 it had fallen to in February."
4011910,90695,2016-10-13T10:42:03-04:00,"Buying Twitter solely on the premise of a buyout is too risky for most investors.Buying Square in anticipation of a Twitter buyout exposes investors to far less risk but allows them to participate in much of the upside.I believe that if Twitter gets a bid, Jack Dorsey will be replaced as CEO and will be able to focus on running Square.","Investors have spent the last several weeks watching Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) euphorically rise and precipitously fall in seemingly endless fashion. The blue bird's rumored buyout has created a lot of distraction and noise within the technology sector and notably volatile trading days for prospective suitors, namely Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Though the former is still rumored to be in talks with Twitter, it appears as though many of the offers on the table have dried up - for now.In my opinion, Twitter, the product, is quite unique and has immense value. Twitter, the company, cannot seem to please investors. Many Twitter bag holders are pleading for the company to divest Vine, the six-second video sharing platform, and sell mobile-development platform Fabric to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Whether these initiatives will come to fruition and, more importantly, whether they will increase shareholder value, I know not. However, it is possible that a Twitter suitor will look at the aforementioned assets and think similarly, which could be the reason why some are still rumored to be in talks with the company at large.To be frank, I believe that Twitter will ultimately decide to sell itself to the right buyer. With that said, I cannot justify buying any stock solely on the basis of a possible takeover. As investors have witnessed with Twitter's recent price action, hyper inflation due to takeover rumors can lead to a catastrophic drop when the air is let out of the bag. In effect, prospective takeovers are rather binary and far too risky for most investors.Interestingly, I think the best way to profit from Twitter's possible takeover is to initiate a position in Square (NYSE:SQ). Although true that such a position does not expose investors to as much potential upside, it would allow them to participate in some of the upside with far less risk. My reason behind this thesis is that investors may believe that while concurrently the CEO of two multibillion-dollar, publicly-traded corporations, Jack Dorsey is spread too thinly. Many believe that the 39-year-old chief executive has enough on his plate with Twitter, needless to say with Square, too. As such, investors may be devaluing shares of both Twitter and Square.Given Twitter's floundering stock price and the wide frustration that has emerged under Dorsey's reign, it is possible that Twitter's acquirer would look to appoint new blood to the role of chief executive. This would allow Dorsey to focus all of his efforts on Square and warrant a higher valuation for the stock.In its current state, my investment thesis for Square contradicts my previous statement that I cannot justify buying a stock solely on the basis of a takeover. However, Square has bullish characteristics on its own, and a possible buyout of Twitter would only add to the bullish thesis.I believe that much of Square's volatility since its IPO roughly one year ago is due to the market environment in which it came public. In other words, I think that the stock's volatile performance is due to external forces rather than company-specific worries.In November of 2015, the broader market was near its top and fell rapidly in the coming months. As a newly issued stock, Square posed a great risk to investors and, as such, was among the first assets to be sold when the market turned sour.In recent months, however, investors have been able to stomach more risk. Recent IPOs Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and Acacia Communications (NASDAQ:ACIA) were applauded by investors and are now well above their public offering price, a sign of a risk-on environment. Another sign of a market that has an appetite for risk is that the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 have been outperforming the S&P and Dow Jones. In the last few months, while the latter two indices have been making lower highs, the former two have been making higher highs. In my opinion, this divergence signals that investors have been rotating out of big-cap names and into small-caps and technology, which have a reputation of risk and volatility.With the backdrop of investors' increasing appetite for risk and IPOs, if Twitter catches a bid, I believe that investors will circle back to the previously over-looked Square and appreciate the company's fundamentals.Although not recent news, I believe that Square's integration into Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iMessage will prove to be very sticky. iPhone users can now send money to their friends and family with Square Cash all without ever opening their phone (with Siri). It is also worth noting that the recent problems with the Samsung Galaxy Note have been rumored to increase iPhone sales to the tune of 15 million. If true, this would lead to an unexpectedly large new-user base for Square, which could cause an upside surprise in total revenue.With that said, Square has many competitors, namely PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and PayPal-owned Venmo. However, I think that the convenience of Square Cash within iMessage differentiates the company's product. Additionally, Square has developed a trustworthy relationship with its users, something that cannot be done overnight. In a previously published piece on PayPal I discussed the trust associated with virtual payments. In my view, trust is the greatest barrier to entry in the online payments space. It explains why companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snap (Private:CHAT) have had trouble integrating financial transactions into their platforms.Fundamentally, Square reported adjusted revenue of $171 million for the second quarter, which represents an increase of 54% year-over-year. The company forecasted adjusted revenue for the year between $655 and $670 million, up 6% from the midpoint of their previous guidance. Despite the revised guidance, I suspect that Square will guide higher in their upcoming quarter due to conservative estimates regarding the success of Square Cash on the iPhone.Couple the above prospects with the possibility of Dorsey focusing all of his attention on Square, and I think that the company should be seen in a bullish light. Buying Twitter solely on the premise of a possible buyout is incredibly risky - many investors witnessed this last week. Instead, buying Square in anticipation of the implications of a Twitter buyout exposes investors to far less risk while also allowing them to participate in the upside potential from Dorsey's undivided attention."
4018675,98236,2016-11-03T02:51:44-04:00,"Square reported the results of its September quarter earlier this morning.
        Simply put, the results were a beat on revenue and a more substantial beat on profitability.
        In addition to the beat, management significantly raised expectations for both revenues and profitability this quarter.
        The company achieved a number of discrete milestones including revenue growth of greater than 50% and 140% growth in terms of its software, delivery and credit revenues.
        The company's eco-system has shown significant expansion which is building a far different business model than has been the popular perception.","Understanding the mundane is what it is all aboutSometimes the success of an entrepreneur is predicated on very simple things. The great inventions of the 19 th century were, to a greater or lesser extent, low tech adaptations of existing technology. There was nothing whiz-bang about the telephone or the telegraph or the railway or the elevator. They used existing bits of technology in different ways to change the course of life in the 19th century dramatically. Entrepreneurs such as Jay Gould wouldn't have been able to define technology and Gould personally was scared of electricity. And yet Gould became one of the richest men in America simply by putting together low tech solutions like the telegraph (Western Union), the Transcontinental Railroad (Union Pacific)/(NYSE:UNP) and the elevated railway in New York City (Manhattan Elevated) that changed people's lives.Square (NYSE:SQ) does not really change people's lives. I cannot bring myself to agree that it does after several years of watching the story unfold. Improving the speed of an EMV transaction to 4.2 seconds is no doubt a great accomplishment, but I am not sure what it means to a user like me or even to a merchant. Every time I look at that statistic which is boldly emblazoned at the start of the shareholder letter I am reminded of the quote from Thoreau in which he says that ""we do not ride on the railroad (or a new chip card reader), it rides on us."" But then 4.2 seconds is a snail's pace-the use of Near Field Communications decreases the speed of a payment to less than a second-definitely a change in the lives of people.There have been negative articles written about Square on this site as well as a preponderance of positive articles. Some of them sadly, are inaccurate in terms of their ratio presentation which can be a bit difficult for a company like this. Some continue to emphasize the demise of the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) relationship. Others continue to emphasize the class of customer this company sells to. They are all more than a bit vitriolic and bad-tempered and seemingly mis-placed. For myself, I never have been bitten by a Square payment device and I happily use them all the time and take my 4.2 seconds to pay for my morning coffee.But regardless of what has been written by me or others, the company has thus far succeeded in a very crowded space by outperforming in terms of its solutions on the most mundane tasks in the retail world-taking payments and taking them quickly and accurately and with a minimum of hassle for merchants and their customers. The shares are up 6% today, but they are still down more than 10% YTD. The shares have appreciated by 16% since I first recommended the name in the wake of a controversy regarding SQ capital. On the other hand, it has beaten expectations twice and raised forward guidance consistently-the case for the shares, in my opinion, is stronger now than it was when I first recommended the name in May.The purpose of this article is to assess the health of the company's business drivers and to make a determination if the sum of all the parts adds up to potential returns for investors. I though they did in May and I continue to think they do in November. There ought to be along runway for this name.Jack Dorsey, scraggly beard and all, is not perhaps, the most popular cultural icon in America these days. I find his politics simply abhorrent. And I will stop right there in terms of further commentary about the man's outside activities. And the controversies that swirl about his ""first"" company, Twitter, (NYSE:TWTR) seem endless and difficult to handicap. Of course that wouldn't matter that much if the company had better operating results-but hey, you can't have everything.But give the man and his colleagues credit. He has taken a mundane task and seems to be building a business based on that. The results this past quarter suggest that most of the strategies are working. The results also seem to suggest that Square Capital, the most controversial of the strategies, is on track or ahead of the company's expectations. But what impresses me the most is how the company takes steps that to those of us, outside the small business world, seem negligible but in total, they are adding up to a company. Features such as Scheduled Deposit, or Register Card on File don't seem all that sexy or high-tech. It is more than a year since the EMV liability shift took effect and there are still merchants who haven't figured out how to speed up account processing. All of these things collectively probably amount to a few minutes a day at most, and yet that is how this business has been successful in the midst of ferocious competition.Does it sound like hyperbole or an ad for Square? Perhaps. But 51% top line growth and a revenue run rate that has now reached $700 million/year requires some kind of recognition in valuing this business. The company guidance for Q4 is for revenues of $184 million at the midpoint, a sequential increase of 3.4%. That is almost certainly a forecast that is made to be beaten and to be beaten substantially; this is a company whose primary revenue stream is processing payments for retailers and Christmas is always a seasonal highpoint. As more of Square's business shifts to larger and somewhat more mainstream retailers, the Q4 seasonality should be stronger. It is my impression from the conference call, and from the response of CFO Sarah Friar to a specific query, that the company has adopted a ""stair-step"" approach to raising guidance and that Q4 is more likely to see strong sequential growth.Indeed, in an answer to another query, It sounded very much as though the CFO felt that the company had an opportunity to sustain 50% growth into 2017. That isn't the guidance and the current consensus expectation had been for growth barely above 20%. That will almost certainly change but it will not reach 50%.What is Square's secret sauce? How does it print above expectation quarters and keep its growth higher than anticipated? Like Jay Gould (probably not Jack Dorsey's favorite hero) or the other famous entrepreneurs of the past, it is taking lots of little bits and pieces of readily available technology, cobbling them together and producing a set of solutions that proves to be highly enticing for the targeted user group. I think some writers on this site have missed that point. The little card readers, the POS terminals, and certainly the software are not really high tech offerings. Even the services that are offered are not unique. It's the combination of all of these services, available in one place at a reasonable price that is the secret sauce and the budding moat for Square. The company has launched Build with Square, a developer platform that allows users to find custom solutions that fill requirements unique to their business. It is difficult for many users to find alternatives that provide the solutions they want in a single place on a single platform at a reasonable price.Some Square recipesI will touch on payment processing and some of the other moving pieces that are part of the Square ecosystem here. Payment processing is the core of what this company does and they seem to be good at it. Payment processing is and will remain an intensely competitive business, but Square has maintained a take rate just shy of 3% for some time. Actually, the company's transaction revenues at 2.93% of GPV is a decent achievement compared to 2.95% in the year earlier period, as the company pivots significantly to larger sellers who typically pay a lower percentage rate on their transactions to Square. In order to achieve that kind of performance, the company has invested in technology and continues to drive down the cost of processing payments. The ability the company has shown of keeping its take rate stable isn't necessarily because users want to pay a premium price, but they are wiling to pay a competitive price when they can buy other services that exist on the same platform.The company has continued to confound skeptics with the growth of its payment volumes which were up 39% year on year in the just past quarter. The sequential growth in that metric was 5.6%. Typically, Q3 shows the lowest sequential growth of any of the quarters during the year. Perhaps even more impressive was the 55% jump in the payment volumes of the company's larger customers. Square is seen by some observers as an SMB company but that doesn't mean it sells to ""Ma & Pa's"" as a focus. At this point 14% of its GPV comes from customers with an annualized payment volume of greater than $500k and 43% of GPV comes from sellers with more than $125k in annual sales processed through Square. Presumably management believes that these customers will be able to buy other services from Square and will be a bit less price sensitive than the tiniest of establishments.A more typical client these days is one of those featured in the quarterly stock holder letter called Bang. Bang is a chain of 3 hair dressing establishments with 40 employees and 3 locations in metro Seattle. The company uses Square CRM and Square Capital and the value of the account in terms both of revenues and margins is almost certainly significantly greater than an average Square customer because Bang uses two additional Square services.While I expect that the GPV for Square is likely to continue to show substantial growth because of the strong eco system that the Square platform enables and because of its substantial focus on the minutiae of what users want from payment processing, over time the key to the story is the revenues the company can achieve outside of payment processing. But the CFO hastened to point out that there remain 20 million businesses in the U.S. that do not accept cards. 51% growth is possible for Square for next year. But it is going to be difficult to provide the margin growth seen this past quarter with is seen as an elevated cadence of revenue growthThe secret ingredientsThe revenue category with the most potential is one called Software and Data Products which was $35 million in the quarter, up by 140% from the year earlier level and about 20% of total adjusted net revenues at this point. This category trebled sequentially in Q3 when compared to Q2 and it is the category that will, I believe, make or break this company's success in the longer term. Although this category was only 20% of revenues, it produced $23 million of gross margin while the gross margin for the transaction business is far lower. This category includes Square Capital, Caviar, the restaurant delivery service and Instant Deposit which proved to be the service with the highest growth last quarter.No doubt Instant Deposit will be copied over time by many other payment processing providers and some of the margin the company currently enjoys will be competed away, I imagine, but it is one of the more important differentiators the company currently offers. The profitability of the service, which cost users 1% of a the value of a transaction for what is essentially a 2-3-day loan is self-evidently very high.Square Capital enjoyed 70% year on year growth and the company saw 35,000 users receive loans in the last quarter. The company originated $209 million of loans last quarter and has originated $421 million of loans year-to-date. As has been written about by many observers, Square Capital is a very profitable service that the company offers with interest rates at the very top of permissible levels. It is a business that is built on the convenience it offers borrowers who are far less concerned about the pricing of their advances and are far more concerned about availability and convenience and timeliness of decisions. The interest cost of a $5000 loan with a 2 month term and a 35% APR is less than $300 so loan pricing does not carry a significant weight in the decision of users to use Square Capital.According to management, many users have renewed their loans several times already-it is a painless way to find capital and one that can be almost addictive in its nature for a small business. It is not easy to quantify the ultimate TAM for Square Capital; because the loan loss ratio is low, the company hasn't had much of a problem in attracting investors. CFO Sarah Friar indicated that the company has lots of financial capacity with both new and with current investors. It is one of the few avenues that these investors have to generate dramatically differentiated ROI with a reasonable level of risk. And Square's loan approval process is far more efficient and predictable than any other avenue of small business finance. Overall, transaction losses declined significantly from $17 million to $12 million in the period suggesting that the company's vetting methodology is producing decent results.While the specific financial metrics of Square Capital are straightforward enough, the company has apparently seen equivalent success with Caviar. This is less easy to determine because Capital, Caviar and Instant Deposit are bundled together in terms of a specific revenue line.Caviar is a restaurant delivery service which sounds mundane enough. But Caviar is actually often bundled with software from 2 partners, TouchBistro and Vend which have partnerships with and integration with Square. I will let the CEO speak on the subject from the call transcript, ""So, Caviar has been phenomenal for us and serving restaurant sellers, driving more sales to them, removing the constraints of a number of tables they have in their physical space and allowing them to deliver whatever they make all over time. It also benefits from the fact and we' continuously benefit as we go throughout the year of any of those Caviar restaurants could eventually take advantage (of) Square services as well. And this is how we think about our ecosystem, it's not just one product, but they all work better together.""The barriers to entry for a restaurant delivery service are modest and here in New York there are many of them. But most of the services can't provide a small business accounting solution, a POS system and extend loans to the restaurant customers. That is the secret ingredient and it is not nearly so easy to copy.Valuations and RisksObviously the two are interrelated. I don't know just how many payment processors there are in the world-hundreds, dozens, enough to fill a ballroom? There are going to be more than a few skeptics amongst readers who will not accept or who are dubious that the company has built and continues to build a defensible eco-system. And I can't do much other than retort-look at the numbers and the numbers compared to forecast.Square remains a very new company. This is just the 4 th quarter it has reported a a public company. It has not reached a stage of maturity from which absolute conclusions might be drawn. I suppose one might say it has more or less proven its concept but it hasn't been through some testing event such as a recession or had to deal with the impact of a competitor aimed at its turf. I suspect that it hasn't yet reached a level of success where competitors are going to spring up to try to emulate its formula. Sooner or later, however, it will have to deal with a recession. There are plenty of foreseeable risks that a company whose income is derived by processing retail payments of smaller merchants, delivering restaurant meals and extending credit to small merchants will face in a recession. It would be foolish to even think that a recession could have a massive impact on this company and probably more than some other smaller enterprise IT vendors.And there are other readers who have a bad taste from investing in Twitter and are left to wonder if Jack Dorsey has either a Midas touch or has the kiss of death in his beard. Honestly, something like that is probably beyond my pay grade. I understand, or think that I understand, the business strategy that Square has developed and I have seen it developed successfully elsewhere in the enterprise IT space. Developing a full stack of mutually supported solutions is classically the way software companies have been built since Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) decided it needed to have financial applications to dell relational databases and SAP (NYSE:SAP) decided that it needed to sell far more than a single manufacturing solution.I believe that Square's eco-system and its continued development have mitigated risks to some extent; other readers will likely reach a different conclusion. But of course, risk is also a function of valuation.Currently Square is forecasting revenues this year of about $680 million. I think, as I wrote earlier in this article, that such a number is unduly conservative in considering seasonality alone. So, I will use $700 million as a revenue estimate for this year. ( I believe that most analysts and investors look exclusively at adjusted revenues when establish valuations for this company-the company reports a metric of total net revenue which is forecast to be $1.7 billion which includes the fees that the company collects from merchants on behalf of the credit card companies; adjusted revenues are the revenues the company earns for its role as a payment processor.)Currently, the consensus forecast for 2017 is for 21% growth. The consensus forecast, as shown by Yahoo is not really useful in determining EV/S for the company. It includes Starbucks revenue which is phasing out and it is based on gross transaction revenues and not a take rate. In any event, given that total revenues grew 50%+ last quarter, I think using a 35% growth rate for next year is reasonably conservative. So, that produces a revenue estimate of about $950 million. As of today's closing share price, the company has a market capitalization of $4.6 billion and an enterprise valuation of $4.2 billion. That produces EV/S metrics of 6X and 4.4X respective, fairly reasonable for a high growth enterprise software vendor with what is basically a recurring revenue stream.The company doesn't explicitly forecast non-GAAP EPS. The current consensus as shown by 1 st call is for a loss per share of $.60 this year and of $.35 next year. That being said, this company's margins are improving quite rapidly. Operating expenses for the quarter rose by 13% overall on a non-GAAP basis while revenues rose by 51%. Part of that was indeed substantial growth in stock based comp which increased by 80% year over year, but expense discipline was evident in the major expense categories other than general and administrative expense. Overall, the company had adjusted revenues of $178 million in the quarter, it had cost of sales of about $28 million of its adjusted revenue and operating expenses non-GAAP of $138 million. That is a pretax loss of $10 million or about $.03/share. I would expect that the company will be able to achieve pre-tax profitability of a few cents a share in Q4. I would expect that the company could generate after-tax, non-GAAP EPS of $.30-$.50 in 2017. The company does not report those numbers in any of its financial presentations, but I think they are useful to consider in evaluating the shares against those of other companies. I think that the adjusted P/E that I have derived which is around 25-30X based on a comparable method of computing non-GAAP earnings, is again very reasonable.The company is generating positive cash flow at this point. The CFO said, ""So our strategy in cash is always to keep making it. So, we'll keep doing that."" It has reported CFFO of $42 million during the quarter and that is net of $28 million in terms of the loans it has advanced less repayments. Overall, the CFO said that cash flow ought to track EBITDA.Needless to say, it is hard to develop some kind of comparable free cash flow metric with that kind of guidance. The company reported adjusted EBITDA last quarter of $12 million and it is forecasting that it will achieve adjusted EBITDA this quarter of $16-$18 million. It has reported adjusted EBITDA through 9 months of $15 million. Does that mean that CFFO will be something like $90 million for the year? I will stick with that kind of number and a free cash flow estimate of $70 million. That kind of estimate yields a free cash flow yield of less than 2% this year and perhaps 3%-4% next year.I think the takeaway from this discussion is that Square shares are not valued at some ridiculous level that could never be justified short of using some unreasonable forward assumptions. If the story is right, the valuation is such that shareholders will get a benefit-there is reason to think that if the story is right, than the company will produce significant positive alpha going forward."
4028092,102229,2016-12-04T15:45:52-05:00,Square has been generating yearly revenue at the rate of 35% ~ 55% per year in a highly competitive market.The company expects to post diluted EPS of -$0.55 for 2016 vs -$1.24 in 2015.Wall Street expects the company to post diluted EPS -0.09 for its 4th quarter.The mobile payment market currently garners about $650 billion and is expected to double in 2019.,"Source: Small Biz Survival, Huffington Post and SquareWhy do I think Square (NYSE:SQ) is heading for profitability?The company's growth rate is very impressive. In 2013, the company generated about $203 million in net revenue while the company expects to generate $1.71 billion net revenue in 2016. Accumulated growth rate from 2013 to 2016 is about 428%. While maintaining year over year higher growth rate, the diluted EPS decreased in its third quarter by about 50%. The biggest money makers are currently Square Capital, which advances cash to merchants, and Caviar, a food-delivery service, according to WSJ. The CFO Sarah Friar said on a conference call with analysts as follows:While maintaining a higher revenue growth, if the company reduces its cost of revenue (like it did in its 3rd quarter), the company will likely post its first profit in 2017.Sentiment:As we can see from the above table, the institutional ownership has been gradually increasing while short interest has been gradually decreasing, indicating a bullish signal. The institutional ownership has increased from 12% to about 24% within this year. The short interest decreased from 71% to 61% within a few months. The company has a consensus Price Target of $13.17 which is 3.65% upside, according to market beat.Square is a mobile payment company. In a nutshell the company collects money from a buyer and transfers it to a seller through its device that can be interfaced with a smartphone or tablet. The company keeps 2.65% per swipe for Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express and the remaining amount is transferred to the seller's bank account within one to two business days. There are no fees for the buyer. It is a very simple and effective business model and the company is very open about its business.Example on a $5,000.00 sale:=$5,000 x 0.0265 (2.65%)= $132.50 (Square's commission)= $5,000 - $132.50= $4,867.50 is the final amount you would receive from Square within one to two days.Source: SquareFinancial and Operational Performance and Forecast:Square has been generating higher revenue year over year. The company generated about $203 million in 2015; they are expected to generate $1.7 billion in total revenue. Although the company hasn't made a profit yet, the net loss for 2016 is expected to decrease by about 50% from the previous year.Source: Created by Author (data obtained from SEC filing)For the first three quarters of 2015, Square posted a net loss of $0.88 per share. Similarly, for the first three quarters of 2016, the company posted a net loss of $0.46 per share. The loss per share decreased by about 48% from the previous quarters.Source: Created by Author (data obtained from SEC filing)Valuation:The book value of the company is about half a billion, with the P/B ratio at about 10. This indicates that Square's stock costs about 10 times what their assets could be sold for. The average P/B ratio in the technology sector is about 4. It appears that the stock is overvalued.Source: Created by Author (data obtained from SEC filing)Market Size and Competition:The current size of the mobile payment market is $650 billion and this is expected to grow to $1080 billion in 2019, according to Statista. Source: StatistaThere are numerous competitors in this market with PayPal at the top of the heap, as the below pie chart shows. Square does offer a free reader and free app. Square is for everyone, according to Merchant Maverick.Source: QuoraDownside Risk:As they mentioned on their third quarter filing, Square relies on app marketplaces such as the Apple App Store and Google Play to drive downloads of their mobile app. Apple, Google and other operators of app marketplaces regularly make changes and those changes may make access to Square's products and services more difficult. In the event that it is difficult for their sellers to access and use their products and services, their business may be materially and adversely affected. The company further said as follows:Conclusion:The company has been generating higher revenue year over year. Wall Street expects the company to post a loss of 9 cents per share for its 4th quarter of 2016. The company's net loss decreased by about 50% in its third quarter compared to the previous quarter; so it is moving in the right direction by generating higher revenue and reducing its loss. At this rate, I expect the company to post its first profit in the second or third quarter of 2017.Based on my analysis, I recommend Square as a BUY (buy the dip; recommended entry price is $9) I always recommend that you protect your positions with insurance (option)."
4018033,22148,2016-11-02T03:03:28-04:00,"Square easily surpassed Q3 estimates.Crucial adjusted revenues are growing at an annualized level above 50%.The diluted share count has always obstructed the investment thesis, but the stock is approaching levels where the enterprise value is now appealing at levels above $10.","The title of this article sums up my thesis on Square (NYSE:SQ) and is part criticism to myself and others for not buying the stock on the dips this year below $9 on several occasions. The Q3 results provide another example of the momentum in the business with a prime question still surrounding valuation.In after-hours trading, Square trades up around $11.50. Based on the outstanding stock options not including the diluted share count of a company not reporting a profit, the stock is worth up to $5.2 billion now and far above the $3.6 billion listed on most financial websites questioning whether the market fully understands the stock options issue.As has been a pattern now for several quarters since going public, Square easily surpassed Q3 estimates and guided up for the year. The mobile payments company now forecasts the key adjusted revenues reaching up to $680 million for the year.While some investors focus on the gross numbers that include transaction costs and the declining Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) revenues, the adjusted revenues will grow 50% for the year. This is crucial as the removal of the Starbucks revenue in Q4 that accounted for nearly $80 million in revenues YTD obscures the growth rate.Source: Square Q3'16 shareholder letterConsidering the transaction costs are just pass-through costs at a rate of roughly 65% of transaction revenues, the sure size as well obscures the growth rate of the software and data products that includes Square Capital. For Q3, those revenues hit $35.3 million for a 140% growth rate.The amount is immaterial when viewing the net revenues of over $439 million that are highly influenced by the pass-through of $254 million of transaction costs. Using adjusted revenues of $178 million, the software and data segment accounts for around 20% of total revenues.So once understanding that Square is firing on all cylinders regarding revenues when looking at the right numbers, the question of valuation always pops up. Using the outstanding shares of 450 million based on my last article highlighted above, the stock is worth about $5.2 billion or an enterprise value of around $4.7 billion when excluding $530 million in cash.One hidden area where these stock options benefit Square is via the cash proceeds as employees exercise those options. For the first nine months of the year, the mobile payments company has obtained $48.3 million in proceeds that has helped build the cash position. The listed diluted share count is only 344 million, so the continued exercise of stock options will further build the cash balance as the company has turned EBITDA positive as well.If Square only grows the adjusted revenues by 35% next year, revenues will surge to over $900 million. A 40% growth rate gets the revenues all the way up to $950 million. As more stock options are cashed in, the current stock value sits at an enterprise value of 4.5x sales estimates.The key investor takeaway is that the market still doesn't seem to understand the fully diluted share count or the adjusted revenues. The end result is a volatile stock. One though shouldn't expect any more dips below $10 as value is starting to rise at valuations previously used as a crucial limit."
3997809,98236,2016-08-09T14:01:00-04:00,"Square reported an exceptionally strong quarter on just about all financial metrics, particularly with regard to adjusted EBITDA margins last week.While the shares did respond, the current share price leaves the company having the dubious achievement of producing significant negative alpha over the past several months.The company's Square Capital operation, which had been a focus of negative attention upon the release of Q1 results, showed impressive progress last quarter.The company's margins, considered by some as a potential source of future problems, remained stable despite a significant shift in mix to larger customers who enjoy better terms.The company reported that its original customer cohort that dates back to 2010 is still showing total revenue growth in Q2 2016, a key metric in terms of future profitability.","Square - A company that is fun and acceptable to attackSomehow since its birth and its IPO, Square (NYSE:SQ) has seemingly become one of the ""go-to"" companies for those searching this market for negative bets. While the shares did jump 13% in the wake of last week's earnings release, in general, the reaction of analysts covering the name was another yawn. Of those analysts who report their ratings to First Call, no brokerages changed their ratings, and all the brokerages except one raised their price target. There are those analysts who have decided that an $8 price target accurately encompasses the outlook for this company in the wake of a quarter that saw its adjusted revenues rise 55%. And which saw a rather substantial earnings beat as well. Interesting!There are really two brokerages that, for reasons not readily apparent to mere mortals, raised their price targets to $8 for a stock selling for $11+ and still rate it a hold. I think I might decide to change my rating or not cover the name at all if I had a price target 27% below the current price and rated the shares a hold - but such is the state of dysfunction in the analytical world these days.I first wrote an article about this company on April 13th. Since that time, the shares have fallen by a bit more than 25% while the IGV software-tech index was rising by 10%. That is called lots of alpha - just not the right kind. Since the start of the year, the IGV has increased by 8% while the shares of SQ have fallen by 15%. Over that time period, the company has reported its first three quarters of data as a public concern. Those results have always shown very rapid revenue growth coupled with a consistent improvement in profitability. I will drill down later in this article, but so far as it goes, there have been six significant high-level metrics published in the period this company has been reported as a publicly-held business. Five of them were greater than guidance or consensus expectations and one of them, Q1 EBITDA, came in flat with the high end of prior guidance.There are many, many skeptics who cast a baleful eye regarding the outlook for Square based on a plethora of concerns, but the facts in terms of the company's operating performance and its growth since it has been public speak for themselves. The short interest is high although it may possibly have peaked last month. But the level of skepticism is evinced by the fact that of the nine analysts reporting their ratings in the wake of the call, there were seven holds and two buys, and the highest price target amongst the analysts with buy recommendations was $15. Indeed, the company got but five analysts to even listen to its call in real-time which may be some kind of a record for a company with a market capitalization of $4 billion.So what is ailing SQ's shares?Perhaps the shares have been pressured by founder Jack Dorsey's luxuriant beard - maybe if he shaved it off, the shares would appreciate. Many years ago, a young woman from upstate NY, Grace Bedell, who was but 11 years of age at the time, suggested that then candidate Lincoln grow a beard. While making no promises to his young correspondent, he chose to add whiskers to his face despite his concern that it might be viewed as a silly affectation.Young Grace felt that Mr. Lincoln's face was terribly thin and that a beard would commend him to all the ladies who would then tease their husbands into voting for him (women did not vote in 1860). Indeed, he took the suggestion to heart, grew a beard, and the rest as they say is history.I do not know if Mr. Dorsey's face is considered thin or otherwise and I have even less idea if merchants would respond to his being clean shaven by increasing their gross payment volume to $15 billion, but it is surely a sacrifice he ought to be willing to make for such a substantial return. Entrepreneurs have obligations to investors and sacrificing a beard is a small enough burden to get the shares of Square moving.Or maybe the share price performance has something to do with the lack of success for Mr. Dorsey's ""other"" company, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and maybe there are those who do not care for the shape of the card reader and would buy the shares if the shape of the device was an oval.I think that perhaps the greatest hurdle with regards to the company's share price is the overall controversy regarding the payments space and its place in that competitive ecosystem. I will address that issue in some more detail later in this article as it seems to me the one that is most salient from a valuation standpoint. At this point, the Q2 metrics showed remarkable stability in terms of both transaction revenue and transactional profit as percentages of Gross Payment Volume despite the increasing scale represented by the company's significant over-attainment in GPV as well as the fact that large seller GPV grew by 61% to 42% of revenues (Presumably, the largest sellers are able to negotiate better pricing from SQ, and yet, despite the rapid increase in large seller volumes, the margin figures held stable).One contributor to this site felt that buying the shares of SQ was a mistake because they had been criticized by something called Cheddar TV and further dissed by Seeking Alpha. I will let readers decide on the arguments, so called, in that piece other than to wonder out loud if Seeking Alpha ever, as a web site, offers opinions on stocks. The author(s) themselves need to figure out what is the current status of the relationship between Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and SQ and to further explore the nature of the deal between PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Visa (NYSE:V).Starbucks has apparently found it more difficult than it had contemplated to transition from the Square relationship. As a result, the Starbucks revenue contribution year on year was flat and the company made $4 million on processing for Starbucks compared to a loss of $7 million the prior year. The rather cryptic comment regarding the future of the relationship is that the two companies are negotiating an extension to the agreement which had been scheduled to sunset this quarter. Square forecasts adjusted revenue which has excluded since the time the company filed its IPO. I note just to be clear that the company's adjusted EBITDA attainment excluded the profit from Starbucks and included the $6 million write down of prior year transaction costs. I might speculate that the service that Square provides Starbucks must have some significant benefits for the latter if it is to be extended on significantly better terms compared to those that have cost Square so much money over the years.I had foreshadowed my expectation that the shares would see some pressure from the expiration of a lock-up which took place in May. But some pressure and what has actually taken place are two quite different things. As a corollary to that point, one Seeking Alpha contributor observes that the outstanding count might be adjusted by more than 100 million shares to account for the potential dilution that will show up when the company is profitable. That is probably one of the better arguments regarding the most recent share price performance than many other less well-founded theories.Further, there was a substantial and apparently unfounded controversy about the outlook for the company's merchant lending business, but its 23% sequential growth in advances (loans) to merchants might possibly put paid to those concerns. The company chose to expense a $6 million item for prior periods this past quarter which muddies the loan loss provision. Overall, however, the loan loss provision held constant at 4% and transaction losses were below the (brief) historical averages for this company.SQ has not yet achieved non-GAAP profits. And it is no stranger to the use of stock-based comp which has doubled year on year. Stock-based comp was a relatively elevated 23% of revenues last quarter compared to 36% in the prior-year period. At least, as compared to some of its brethren, the company apparently has an aspiration to achieve that kind of performance. The company did achieve a 7% adjusted EBITDA margin this past quarter compared to expectations that ranged between a $4 million loss and break-even. Achieving 7 points of margin upside, even on adjusted EBITDA, is a nice feat for a company showing 54% revenue growth. Furthermore, it should be noted that the $6 million charge taken during the quarter distorted the level of profit performance that the company achieved during Q2.Some thoughts on sauces, secret, not so secret and potentially very profitableThere are many investors, readers and of course analysts who think that Square's future is fraught indeed. Many electrons have been poured into the ether about how Visa was able to take its economic power in the payments processing space and force PayPal to agree to some onerous terms to avoid an even worse fate. This is neither the time nor the place to attempt to do that analysis, but is said by many that payments processing is an unforgiving space with fierce price competition. How can it be expected that SQ can negotiate the shoals and pitfalls of its journey through what is thought to be a treacherous journey. Payments processing is not the equivalent of building a self-driving car and Square CEO Jack Dorsey has never been noted for his incomprehension regarding technology trends. I think it is reasonable to assume that Jack Dorsey did a bit of strategic analysis before venturing to build a company that while a pioneer in the mobile payment processing world certainly faces an abundance of competitors.Rather than me attempting to use a lot of words in a cadence often not to the liking of some readers, here is the crux of the issue of the moat, the special sauce or what have you expressed in the words of a Square user and Jack Dorsey. If you agree with Mr. Dorsey's answer, of which I have excerpted but a part, the decision to purchase the shares is easy. And if you do not, well the reverse is true.The question of relevance comes from a shareholder and a customer, Gerry Griffin of Real Earth Creations. Real Earth is a company that sells rocks of various kinds located in the hamlet of Mt. Ida, AK.Here is Mr. Griffin's question:And Mr. Dorsey's answer:Here is another commentary from Friar:To a certain extent, one's view as to the credibility of these comments says it all - readers can either agree or not, but the core of one of the major investment premises for this company is that Square sells something more than a card reader and a payment system. One believes that they do what they do better, more reliability and their service and products cost their users less when all relevant costs are factored into the analysis. If you believe that, much of the other controversies around this name are nullities - if you don't, no need to read further; you can justify owning the shares.I suppose that I will be accused of having rose colored glasses in this assertion, but again, the numbers that have been shown in these last three quarters are what they are regardless of who articulates them. I think that most investors and observers are well aware of just how crowded the payments space is and the difficulties of creating a competitive moat. I do not believe that there is anyone who is trying to represent that there is any one single piece of technology that is sold by SQ that is completely unique and which doesn't have competitive analogs. Mobile payments were, perhaps, a novelty in 2010 and are far less so today. Cheap card readers are becoming ubiquitous and the need for speed is impacting many older payment technologies. No one doubts for a moment that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and other similar offerings can allow a customer to be parted from his/her money in record time. None of those things are moats. I do think that it is the ecosystem of what they offer, how they offer it and to whom they offer it that represents their moat and their opportunity.Given the death rates in American business, which have been at elevated levels since the Great Recession, the ability to achieve growth from a cohort who first bought Square solutions in 2010 is an accomplishment is unquestionably one of the more important sub-headline metrics reported by this company. If the company is consistently able to attain the growth in business cohorts that were first sold six years old, then I think that it is a very high odds bet that long-term results are likely to result in both profitability and growth significantly above currently anticipated levels.I tried to do a deep dive into the overall set of offerings that this company has put together and how the offerings have significant opportunities for SQ to sell these beyond the processing of credit card payments. Rather than reprise those comments, I will simply highlight the solutions that appear to be generating some significant revenues at this point. CRM for very small retail business can often be the difference between success and failure. It isn't the CRM that Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) sells or even the CRM that NetSuite (NYSE:N) sells, but seems to be effective when replacing spreadsheets and cards. The company offers a payments module that has been purchased by 140,000 users. The company has had great success with its offerings that credits payments essentially instantaneously - for 1% of the sale. Somewhat surprisingly - at least to this writer - is the success of the company's Caviar restaurant delivery business.The company called out a set of new offerings that relate to periodic customer invoices. Many users subscribe to services or buy products that need to be billed on a periodic basis. Sounds trivial, except if a small businessman neglects to get it done and loses revenues or worse still neglects to send the required product. There are variants of this functionality which are called scheduled invoices, recurring invoices and card on file. The company has 140,000 active customers and revenue from the function increased by 122% year on year.Overall, software and data-products revenues more than doubled last quarter and grew by more than 20% sequentially and it represents about 15% of gross profits including the contribution from Starbucks. I think many readers are likely to have underestimated that component of the business opportunity, both for the potential profits it offers as well as the fact that having a broad offering greatly enhances the overall retention rates for the transaction system.Of course, the centerpiece of the software and data products revenue stream is Square Capital. There are those observers who think that Square Capital is potentially the ""jewel in the crown"" so to speak. Others feel that the service is overhyped and is fraught with pitfalls.For those unfamiliar with the service, it involves the ability of Square users to gain access to capital almost immediately and to have that capital deposited in their bank account by SQ without any lengthy approval cycle. The pricing is stiff; the loan acquisition cost is 14% for a loan that typically has a nine-month duration, but users find the availability of the capital outweighs the cost. The loan is repaid as a fixed percentage of every card transaction taken by the seller. The average loan size is all of $6,000, and clearly, it would be very difficult for most traditional financial institutions to process loans of this size profitably. At this point, the loans have had a default rate of 4%, which is probably typical for loans to small business customers. Square has massive advantages compared to other small business lenders, the most important of which is that it has nominal loan acquisition costs. Then too, it generally has all the information it needs to make loan decisions using its access to dashboards that are built into its payment processing and ancillary software.The issues most frequently cited by commentators regarding the risks they see in this business for Square relate to default rates and the availability of capital to fund the program. Last quarter, Square Capital volumes were essentially flat because of the inability to open programs for third-party investors. At this point, the skepticism that animated that hiatus has abated and loan origination more than doubled year on year and increased 23% sequentially. The company obtained five new lending sources and it has apparently a significant pipeline of institutional investors who want to fund additional loan tranches. Given the alternatives available to these investors, it isn't completely surprising that an outlet for capital, such as that offered by Square, is proving to be popular, particularly in the context of the current zero interest rate background.The default rate on the loans made by Square has been and remains 4%. Obviously a company such as SQ has significant advantages compared to other small business lenders in that it gets repayments directly from the sales of its borrowers which give it a unique priority in repayment - so long as it borrower remains in business.There are, of course, small business lending programs available from companies such as American Express (NYSE:AXP). But given that the current loan volume for this company was $189 million last quarter, it would seem that the runway it has is huge. One risk, is, of course, that regulators and populist politicians such as Elizabeth Warren may at some point attempt to regulate fees and repayment terms. That is a long way off at the moment, but it can't be quite ignored.Outlook/ValuationThe company chose to give a rather conservative forecast as part of its earnings presentation. Overall, Square's management is anticipating that full-year adjusted revenues will be in the range of $655 million to $670 million with adjusted EBITDA of $18-24 million. The margin improvement at the mid-point is 1,200 bps. While a 1,200 bps margin improvement is quite extraordinarily, looking at some of the elements that make up the forecast suggests it is likely to prove to be conservative as the growth in revenue streams that have far greater margins than processing remains at levels significantly faster than the growth of payment processing.This company has significant seasonality - it processes payments for retailers and the sales of its customers are seasonal as well, peaking in Q4. That said, it is perhaps overly conservative to forecast no increase in adjusted revenue sequentially as well as a forecast of a significant drop-off in adjusted EBITDA, particularly given the non-recurring charge in that measure included in Q2 results. While the company did increase its full-year guidance, given the substantial over-attainment experienced in Q2, it might be thought that the new forecast, particularly with regard to adjusted EBITDA is likely to prove significantly conservative.Some thoughts about valuation and balance sheetsNeedless to say, a company such as this needs to have significant beats and at least some raises if the share price is ever to work. The company reported a significant cash burn for the first half of the year, but this is not a really useful number to consider. Overall, on a net basis, the company retained about $30 million of Square Capital loans on its balance sheet. In aggregate, the company has $50 million of loans and merchant advances on its balance sheet and has cash of just over $420 million and about $280 million in debt. Absent its retention of loans, its operating cash flow was about negative $5 million, although this included $68 million of stock-based comp, which more than doubled over a six-month span from year earlier levels.Most of the traditional valuation metrics are not going to be useful, at least not yet. Obviously, there are no earnings to be seen and despite the strong increase in EBITDA margins, the level of EBITDA is far from supporting the share valuation. Even adjusting for the investment, the company has made and will likely continue to make in its loan portfolio, cash flow remains negative although it may achieve profitability later this year as overall margins continue to improve.As mentioned earlier, a Seeking Alpha contributor suggests using a measure of fully-diluted shares in terms of calculating an enterprise value that relates to profitability. There is a good argument to be made for that methodology, but the issue I have is that if one uses that kind of metric, then it might be reasonable to add back the Starbucks revenue to the numerator in the equation. I think that most observers are simply using the enterprise value based on the number of shares the company reports in its Qs and Ks and will exclude the Starbucks revenue as well. That yields an outstanding share count of 334 million and a market capitalization of $3.62 billion. The enterprise value on this basis is about $3.5 billion and on the forecast of $670 million of adjusted sales, that is an EV/S calculation of 5.2X. Not perhaps a bargain and one reflective of the skepticism articulated by many regarding the business model and the competitive issues for this company.I think that the company has put together a winning combination of products, services and an ecosystem that is just starting to show its potential. I have no objective way to measure the future course of Square Capital or how it might be valued, but I think words such as large and significant are appropriate. I'm concerned that in this populist economic climate, an interesting capital source such as Square Capital may feel the heavy hand of regulation that will choke off growth, but at much higher levels.Obviously, this company doesn't forecast 2017 expectations nor is there a consensus available. Given the extraordinary growth seen last quarter in GPV, I do not think it is outlandish to estimate 35%+ adjusted revenue growth for the period. That would yield an EV/S of less than 3.9X, which would represent good value in the opinion of this writer.Summing UpWhile the shares of Square have appreciated significantly in the wake of the recent Q2 earnings release, they remain below levels that reflect the company's value. The company's offerings which are far more of an ecosystem than simply a payments processing solution seem likely to me to lead to a sustained period of rapid growth and rising profitability and the shares hardly are valued that way."
4011801,102228,2016-10-12T21:19:06-04:00,"After a well-received IPO, Square, Inc.’s rapport with investors has been more muted for the last year.Square operates its core business, payments processing, in a hyper-competitive and cut-throat arena.A division of Square, Inc., Square Capital, is providing the strong growth and gross margins that investors crave in a low-growth environment.The opportunity for Square Capital is massive and could provide organic growth for Square, Inc. well after physical credit/debit cards become extinct.We will attempt to theorize just how much the Square Capital division might move Square, Inc.’s needle in the future.","When Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) came out with its card reader that plugged into the headphone jack of a smartphone, it seemed as though this little dongle had the potential to disrupt the entire electronic payments industry. Companies as large as Starbucks to individuals wanting to accept credit or debit cards at their garage sales jumped at the opportunity to process payments utilizing Square, Inc.'s platform. Hairdressers, cupcake shops, flea markets or even people just exchanging items listed on craigslist, the future was clear, the days of cash-only transactions looked numbered. Companies such as VeriFone Systems, Inc. (NYSE:PAY), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) were quick to bring their ""me too"" devices to the market. Overnight, consumers had dozens of choices between platforms to accept credit and debit cards. With the moat around smartphone payment processing devices breached, companies started to compete against Square, Inc. the most obvious way, on price. Although Square had a running head start, investors took a deeper look at Square, questioning whether it was the disruptive payment company they had been sold.The inclusion of fingerprint readers on smartphones allowed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to build Apply Pay and Google Wallet. These technologies would allow consumers to leave their cards at home turning their smartphone into a virtual wallet, further cutting the need for Square's services out of the picture. Not only were all these developments a negative for Square's core processing solution, the pace they were coming to market was brisk compared to how the payments industry had progressed in the past. Square was in an inopportune situation; it had sold itself as a high-growth tech company but found itself getting attacked from all angles. Square's gross payment volume was growing at a respectable 42% YoY (year over year). However, competitive pressures meant it just wasn't seeing that growth transfer to the bottom line. Even though it processed $12.5Bn in gross payment volume, it still lost $27mm in the most recent quarter Q2, 2016 (Source: squareup.com). Square needed another growth driver, preferably one with higher margins.Square Capital:Enter Square Capital, the division used Square's credit card processing data to identify potential businesses that might need additional capital in the form of a loan. It also used this same data to determine that the companies it was thinking about lending to had the ability to service that debt. It was a slick platform, taking the two hardest parts of small business lending origination, marketing to clients and then discovery on those clients. When a bank makes a loan to small businesses, if it doesn't already have a relationship with that business, it needs first to get the client to walk into their doors or contact them via phone, email, etc. Then it needs to dive into the businesses tax records, income statement, balance sheet, receipts, etc., figure out sizing and the terms of the loan that particular business could afford to hold on its balance sheet while making the necessary installment payments. Square already had clients using the Square platform to process a large portion of their revenue; it also had much of the information a lender would need to underwrite a loan already on its platform if they had been with Square for some time. In fact, Square wouldn't even need a human loan officer for many of the smaller loans it might extend; a computer could just crunch the data and immediately extend loans to clients that qualified directly through the Square app.Extend these loans Square did; it's how the majority of its clients found out that Square could even provide capital. They got to work one day, opened the Square App and discovered Square was offering a $5-100k loan to them. The business could apply for the loan paperlessly right in the Square app. Small business loans are often unsecured. Unsecured means there is no collateral backing the loan. Collateral for small biz loans can come in form as real estate, expensive equipment, accounts payable or even the inventory itself. A popular method of getting around the unsecured nature of these loans has been for lenders to take over the credit card processing of the small business it is lending. They would then work out an agreement on how the loan is paid back utilizing these credit card receipts. For example, a firm who borrowed $50k and had on average 20k of monthly credit card receipts might work out a schedule in which the lender keeps 30% of the credit card receipts per month until 58k is paid back. Because the lender takes custody of the credit card receipts first, these receipts act as a kind of pseudo collateral. Although this does open up the lender to some gaming of the system (a business owner might endeavor to get more people to pay in cash under such an agreement), this form of misuse hasn't been seen on a large scale. An advantage of Square underwriting these loans is that it is already the card payment processor; with Square loans, no changes are needed to the businesses hardware or software backend.Square Capital offers one of the better ""FinTech"" applications available in the market right now; it gets rid of a great deal of the ""pain points"" experienced in small biz lending. By reducing so many pain points, growth at the Square Capital's division has been booming. In Q 2016 Square Capital extended $189mm of capital to clients growing 123% YoY and 23% sequentially (Source: squareup.com). Square extended these loans to 34,000 businesses making the average loan amount $5,500 per customer. These small loan amounts highlight another benefit of the platform, as loans are executed electronically, and Square has the data and processing already in place, loans that typically wouldn't make sense for banks are economical for Square. Typically, it wouldn't be worth the headache for a bank to extend a $5,500 loan to businesses, Square has the platform that makes loans these small not only easy but profitable. It's clear that Square getting into small business lending was a good decision, the question is, just how big could this business be?Opportunity Size:In 2015, Goldman Sachs estimated the total market size in the US of small business loans stood at $186Bn (Source: GS The Future of Finance via betandbetter.com). With the economy recovering from the great recession, one might think the market size of these loans has been growing as well. Market growth hasn't been seen with the 10 largest banks lending $44.7Bn in 2014 down from an all-time high of $72.5Bn in 2006 (Source: WSJ.com). We can see how drastically small business underwriting has shrunk from the below chart:(Source: businessinsider.com)With the big banks continuing to de-lever their balance sheets in the wake of the credit crisis, SME (small medium enterprises) lending has been a segment banks haven't been interested. Firms such as Kabbage (KBGE) and OnDeck (NYSE:ONDK) have stepped in, trying and fill the gap left by the big banks moving away from SME loan underwriting. They haven't been able to fill this gap left by the big banks completely, and many small businesses have resorted to using their company credit cards as a source of capital, funding their day to day operations or growth initiatives. Small businesses charged an estimated $445Bn to credit and charge cards in 2015 up nearly 100% since charging $230Bn in 2006 (Source: WSJ.com). Using credit cards as a source of capital with rates as high as 20% isn't ideal when small business loans used to be available at 5 or 6%. Presented with the choice between shrinking the business, not pursuing a growth opportunity or perhaps its very survival, it would appear companies have decided just to pay credit card rates instead of those alternatives. When someone leaves a business rapidly, as in the case with large banks SME lending, often an opportunity is created. This is the opportunity that Square Capital is looking to capitalize.The question remains, just how big could Square Capital grow? OnDeck (ONDK) is a publicly listed company, because of this we find ourselves in a beneficial situation, having a comparable company that legally has to disclose its data once a quarter. In Q2 2016, OnDeck extended $590mm in various loans to small companies (Source: ondeck.com), up YoY by 47%. OnDeck underwrote 200% more loan value than Square Capital did in the same quarter. OnDeck did this without the benefit of having clients already on their platform and all their revenue data already at their fingertips, a huge advantage that Square holds vs. its competition. Kabbage, another competitor to Square Capital, was on a $5mm of loan originations per day run-rate as of October 2015 (Source: crownfundinsider.com). By now, it is likely about on par with OnDeck but back in 2015, our last data point would indicate a $450mm per quarter of originations, 140% more than Square Capital did in Q2 2016. Kabbage actually can use Square's data to help it determine whether to fund a loan or not; it however needs to get that privileged info from the business first. If Kabbage is asking potential clients for their Square records if they use the service, Square Capital in a clearly advantageous situation as it is already privy to all that data. PayPal isn't letting this opportunity pass it by either. On its Q2 2016 earnings release, it stated its working capital loans program had originated $2bn of loans since launching in 2013 (Source: PayPal.com). Not be left out is Intuit who is also facilitating small business loans. It is in a unique position as it has its client's tax data it can draw from when making lending decisions.When I'm looking at the opportunity size that Square Capital is looking, I want to look more at the pre-financial crisis figures. We've already seen that this borrowing didn't vanish, small businesses just decided to use their credit cards to fund their capital shortfall needs. Between OnDeck, Kabbage, PayPal and Square, the total loans funded in 2016 are probably in the range of 5 to 8 billion dollars (I'd go with $6-7Bn as the more likely figure based on the data points I have). These loans represent 4-5% of the loans originated in 2007 and 8.5% of the 2014 small business loans originated. We know from the massive jump in credit card use, companies tapped $215Bn more credit card capital in 2015 as the availability of SME loans decreased. I'd venture to say if banks didn't stop lending forcing small biz to use credit cards 2015 loan originations would probably be well north of $200Bn. We already saw that GS estimated the total small biz loan market at $186mm, if you added just half the additional credit card use, you'd be close to $300bn. $300bn is rather aggressive so for the purpose of this article I think $200Bn is a good estimate of the market size. If that figure is accurate, these four lending platforms likely have around 3-3.5% of the market; that is an absolute drop in the bucket. Could these companies command 15% of the market? 20% or even 25%? They could; the banks have made it clear their time is better spent elsewhere. Now that we know the opportunity size is massive, how can Square make sure it can capitalize on this opportunity, and it's not another highly competitive, low-margin race to the bottom that their payments business appears to be?How Square Makes Money on Loans:As of Q2 2016, Square has $423mm in net cash on its balance sheet, clearly not enough capital to become a lending powerhouse. Square Capital makes money by constantly unloading the loans it originates to third parties that want these loans for a variety of reasons. The lion's share of loans Square Capital makes end up in the hands of Celtic Bank, a bank headquartered in Utah.A typical deal works as follows; Square lends 100k to 10 small businesses at say a guaranteed 14% rate of return, Square takes this block of loans and sells them to a third party. Due to Square Capital selling these loans to the third party at a lower rate of return, it sells them at a premium to the value they were underwritten. If the third party informs Square it will buy those loans at 12%, Square simply sells the $100k block to the bank at $101,700 collecting $1,700 on the transaction. In addition to the $1,700, Square Capital charges origination fees on the loan to the SMEs, if it underwrote those 10 loans for $100k the borrowers might see $98k of the capital. Square collects the $2k difference between loan amount and capital deposited as well. If you translate all this into the actual APR (Annual Percentage Rate) Square Capital collects, Square is underwriting loans that yield 20-30% annualized, a healthy rate of return seeing it can unload them to its investors at low double-digit returns.Looking at the APR for loans extended by OnDeck and Kabbage, however, makes Square Capital seem far less aggressive. Effective APRs for OnDeck and Kabbage loans can be as high 120% with average rates landing in the 40-80% range. Why can Square lend at 20-30% when Kabbage and OnDeck need to lend at 40-80%? It comes down to data and control. First, Square typically has more data on the client than the others have. If Square has been its primary payment processor for some time, it has a great deal of data on that potential borrower. Secondly, Square has access to the credit card receipts first, enabling it to take its payment directly from these receipts before the business can even touch the money. Custody of these receipts makes Square Capitals loans ""collateralized"" to a certain degree while its peers have true unsecured debt on their hands. OnDeck has seen the issues with having unsecured loans on one's balance sheet fist hand. During its last quarter, its unpaid principal balance (UPB) increased 57% YoY due to it holding more loans itself. Because Square Capital has found solid partners to sell its loans to, it has been able to deliver 60% margins in the Square Capital vertical (Source: Nasdaq.com).These margins are significantly higher than its core business, payments gross margin, currently sitting at around 35%. Higher margins had led many analysts to look deeper at Square Capital and were likely the vertical that Point72 Asset Management was targeting when it made a 5.4% investment in Square, reported in August on 2016. Unfortunately, with Square Capital's financial data buried in the statements of Square under ""software and data product revenue"" and ""software and data product costs"". Included in this segment are additional Square product offerings including Caviar (Square's food delivery service), and other SaaS platforms it offers (Software as a Service). We've gone over Square Capital itself, the SME loan market and dug into how the platform works. The next step is to start modeling and ascertain how much this business might move Square's needle.Models:This first model I created was built to give an idea how much Square Capital makes on a hypothetical loan tranche of $100k. Across the X axis, I've listed the APR that the loan tranche was underwritten, along the Y axis is the APR that the investor would buy the tranche from Square. The data points show the revenue that square see's per $100k of loans wrote at those various interest rates:It's a rather simple concept for one to get their heads around. If Square Capital issues a loan at 30% and sells it at 9%, it would make more money than if it issued a loan at 20% and sold it at 15%. What's interesting is that if we take the mid-point of 25% issued and 12% sold and apply that to the $189mm of loans Square Capital underwrote in Q2 2016 the model spits out $23mm of revenue to Square Capital. This figure is not significantly different from the $29.7mm we know the Software and Data products segment did in Q2, and we know that Caviar and other verticals are classified to that segment. These other verticals are likely making up the difference. I think it would make sense for Square just to break out Square Capital on its own, especially as it is highlighting the growth of this segment more on its earnings calls.Based on the $200bn yearly small business loan estimate Square Capital has approximately 35bps of the SME loan market. Square's payment market share is a bit of a conundrum, although it has over 2mm merchants using the platform the number of active users is a quarter of that. It currently is on a run rate to process nearly $50bn of card transactions this year, the entire market in the US is multiples larger. 15% of US GDP is transacted on credit and debit cards totaling over $2.4Trillion in gross market value. Using these figures, Square has approximately a 2% share of the total market. With that in mind, would it be unreasonable for Square Capital to have 1-2-3% of the small biz loan market? I don't think it would be unreasonable at all, in fact, I think that could be just the beginning. So what would annual loan underwriting look like if Square Capital could command that market share:If Square Capital penetrated just 2% of my estimated $200bn small biz Loan market, it would be underwriting $4Bn of loans per year. While this is a long way from its current $800mm run-rate, it's not egregiously different from what OnDeck and Kabbage is doing. And we know that Square Capital is in a rather advantageous position compared to those firms. Gaining 2% of the market could indeed be just the tip of the iceberg, it's a good start. How much would Square Capital make originating that percentage of small biz loans:The above chart shows the yearly revenue Square Capital would generate under different market share figures using three different underwriting and selling interest rates. As we saw earlier, it's advantageous for Square Capital to issue loans at higher interest rates and sell those loans to investors at lower interest rates. Obviously, it has to find some happy medium where it can make sufficient revenue in the division, while still having plenty of investors standing ready to purchase these loans. Because using 25% underwrote and 11% sold produced a revenue figure that was somewhat in line with what Square did on the division in Q2 2016. I'm going to use those as the base case. With base case underwriting and selling figures, if Square Capital grew its market share to 2%, the division would generate over $450mm in yearly revenue. This revenue would be over four times the Software and Data Product division's current yearly run rate, and using the gross margins currently enjoyed by the segment would generate over $275mm in gross profit. That would bump aggregate gross profit by over 50% looking at the most recent quarter.That's assuming it captures 2% of the market. Although Square processes approximately 2% of total card transactions, its percentage of accounts to total merchant accounts is much higher. Square has over 2mm accounts. The US Small Business Admin - Office of Advocacy estimates there are $29.6mm small businesses in the US. Using these figures suggests Square's penetration across all businesses is over 6.5% in the US. Square typically targeted the $26mm estimated small businesses that didn't qualify for traditional merchant accounts with payment processors, so a higher percentage in numbers of accounts makes sense. Square used technology to make electronic payment processing accessible to the hordes of businesses it didn't typically make sense. It makes sense Square Capital can use technology to extend these same businesses capital to grow. The paperless, electronic nature of the service means businesses can borrow as little as $2,000, a loan amount that wouldn't even be entertained by banks or even new facilitators Kabbage and OnDeck.With its data pipe and robust platform, Square could effectively corner the ultra-small business loan market. This small loan market is the opportunity that many who view Square in a favorable light are hanging their hats. With current metrics, Square Capital would have to underwrite $12Bn in total loans per year for its segment to grow larger than the core processing segment itself. If it grew to that size with current gross margins, remaining, Square would be an absolute cash cow. With that in mind what could go wrong or perhaps horribly wrong as Square Capital looks to ramp this business?Risks to Square Capital:Conclusion:Square Capital is one of the most robust product offerings in the Small Business Lending space to come along in a very long time. Very few entities have more information about the inner workings of SMEs' capital flows as Square does. Access to this data puts Square Capital in a unique position; it simply has more data than any of its competition. Square's shares are going into the back half of the year, which is a good place to be in the rather shortsighted world we live. Although investors should view numbers calendar adjusted, the fact of the matter is people just spend more money in Q3 and Q4 with Summer in its peak and the November to December holiday spending boom. Square Capital has solved its near-term investor access dilemma, and we haven't seen any large macro events that would have tempered its appetite. I expect all the above to be supportive of SQ stock in the near term. I don't see any reason now that Starbucks leaving the platform has been disseminated, for SQ stock not to trade up to its 52-week highs. Square's Q3 2016 earnings will be released on November 1st, 2016; I haven't seen anything in the quarter to indicate that either the Payments or Capital businesses had hit a bump in the road. Square's guidance on the Q2 call surprised the Street to the upside. It now has had a full quarter where the Capital business had sufficient investors to gobble up as much as it could underwrite. We already know the margins are better in this segment. If it can lay down another strong quarter of growth, investors will be forced to look Square Capital's prospects in more detail. Square Capital's business could rival the core payments business if it was able to gain more market share. For a business that's currently less than 7% of the total business in revenue terms to have that much runway is a huge lever for Square to pull on to deliver growth. 2% of the total small business loan market is achievable, but I believe it could just be the start. I'd buy SQ stock here and let the next two quarters hit the market; I'll know more about the trajectory of Square Capital then. But I'm not willing to wait until after to invest; I want exposure to Square Capital right here."
4006484,61281,2016-09-15T13:58:47-04:00,"E-payment vendor Square expanded its Square Cash feature into Apple’s iMessege.Together with Square Capital and global expansion, Square could be headed higher.I’m bullish on Square for the long run.","The recent Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) event reveled new devices and features in the iPhone, Apple Watch, and service business lines, and all of them received a fair amount of critics, which ignited a unique discussion that can arise only in regards to an Apple event. As I described in an earlier article, I strongly disagree with the disappointed camp, and I think that Apple did what it had to do, and it fit my expectations correctly. Putting the iPhone, Watch, and most of the iOS developments aside, there is one new development that caught my attention: the new Square (NYSE:SQ) Cash app available to download directly in the newly revamped message app.For many, it might not seem like a big deal, but when Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) tries to monetize Messenger through P2P payments and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) tries to expand Venmo into additional apps and many other initiatives try to ride the waves of the surging e-payments market, it is very impressive to see that iOS users will be able to send money via Square Cash in iMessege and even with Siri's assistance. The P2P payments' market is clearly marching towards adopting the sending of cash within messaging apps. Amid intensifying competition in the e-payments market, this is a huge step forward for Square that could potentially generate a substantial amount of revenue for this initiative.This year, Square will end its biggest partnership with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) that was supposed to help the company promote its e-payment business. However, it ended up as a losing initiative that benefitted Starbucks more than Square. After rightfully eliminating the Starbucks' partnership, Square could potentially experience some temporary declines in its top-line figures until it succeeds in developing some new fruitful and mature revenue streams. For example, the new iMessege initiative could help Square boost its core transaction revenues segment and somehow offset the lost Starbucks' volume.Implementing a P2P payment feature in a messaging app is nothing new for Square, which partnered with Snapchat in 2014 to enable a similar feature. Expanding the in-app feature into iMessege opens up Square to hundreds of millions of additional users who either were not familiar with the service or did not use it for other reasons. Even though the deal terms between Square and Apple are not entirely known, I can only assume that since Square processes Apple Pay on its POS and Apple included Square in iMessege, that the deal is mutually beneficial for both companies. This is a phenomenal opportunity for Square.Alongside the strengthening its core transactions revenues, Square is expanding Square Capital, its loans business for SMBs that are already using Square's services. For merchants, it is a very convenient solution to receive loans to expand the business from a company that already knows them best, enabling retailers to use the same platform they currently use to manage their finances to also manage their business loans. As the e-commerce and e-payments markets grow, there is a growing demand for additional adjacent services that SMBs could benefit from. Square Capital allows Square to leverage its wide network of users and expand its offering to an adjacent business that benefits both Square and its potential clients.However, Square is also trying to expand Square Capital beyond its existing network of merchants as it did lately when it partnered with Toronto-based TouchBistrro and New Zealand-based Vend to offer the Square services to other POS providers. In my opinion, this is a brilliant, relatively low-cost move to expand Square's eco-system worldwide through partnerships. This move has a tremendous potential to generate additional revenues for Square outside of its traditional comfort zone, and it's another good sign that the company is devoted to growth.Taking the Apple partnership, Square Capital's potential, and the new partnerships aboard, I believe that Square could be an attractive FinTech investment. In the current state of the e-payment market, Square's broad portfolio and significant positioning among SMBs could make it an attractive acquisition target for either technology, e-commerce, or financial services companies, which will find Square valuable to their strategies in that area.Square Financial (excluding Starbucks impact) presents an impressive top-line growth of 50% YoY growth and a stable gross margin of around 34%, as shown in the chart below. Even though the bottom line is negative (all figures exclude Starbucks's deal impact), the net loss is narrowing QoQ, and while it is too early to think about a breakeven in Square, the narrowing loss trend is good.In the long term, I believe Square will successfully monetize its messaging app feature of Square Cash as well as Square Capital while expanding the ecosystem worldwide. The uncertainty in the market and possible fluctuation due to macroeconomics terms will probably sharply impact Square and will create an opportunity to buy the stock at an attractive price that is close to the IPO price. I'm bullish on Square for a long-term position."

Its association with millions of sellers allows it to have low acquisition costs, and its low rates are also a big draw.For the third quarter, Square expects revenue to be within the range of $410 million to $420 million and adjusted revenue to be in the range of $167 million to $171 million. Analysts expect loss of $0.10 per share on revenue of $415 million.The company raised its full-year guidance. It now expects total GAAP net revenue to be within a range of $1.63 billion to $1.67 billion. Adjusted revenue is expected to be in the range of $655 million to $670 million, up 6% at the midpoint from its previously guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $18 million to $24 million, up from its previous range of $8 million to $14 million.Square Attracting Large SellersDuring the earnings call, CEO Jack Dorsey talked about the shift in their strategy to extend its target market to large sellers, which he feels are vital to build a viable, long-term business. Companies with more than $125,000 annualized GPV now account for 42% of Square's total GPV, up from 37% in 2Q15. Larger sellers' payment volume grew by 61% in the second quarter.Analysts were concerned about the company's strategy to attract larger sellers, which could lead to pricing concerns and affect margins. However, Square has put those concerns to rest by maintaining the transaction revenue margin while increasing the large sellers' GPV.Its stock is trading at $11.30 with a market cap of $3.65 billion, which is a little over half of its valuation of $6 billion before going public. It touched a high of $15.81 in April after hitting a low of $8.34 in February this year. Of the 23 analysts covering the company, 11 have given it a ""buy"" recommendation while 12 have given it a ""hold"" recommendation. Median target estimate price is $13."

        Square’s Caviar acquisition to break into meal delivery will likely see competition from Uber and perhaps many other players.
        Square Capital is likely to be the company’s most innovative segment with the uniqueness of its lending practice and the way it can potentially scale the remainder of the business.","I have been short Square (NYSE:SQ) since mid-April, as I have reservations about the long-run vitality of the company's product portfolio and service offerings. I believe that many/most of Square's products are fleeting innovations that will have little stick in the marketplace long-term. It's not that Square cannot innovate with respect to future product releases, but I believe the long-term potential of its current product portfolio is flimsy, may disappoint with respect to meeting future demand expectations, and will cede ground or fail to achieve market share due to alternative innovations. The company's lack of competitive advantages is why I've decided to go short based on the current information available.The company's initial flagship product, Square Reader, is a credit card swiping machine that hooks up to a smartphone through the audio jack. I believe Reader lacks market staying power as phone-to-phone payment transfer becomes increasingly more common. The company already does possess a phone-to-phone payment service through Square Cash, but faces competition in a cramped market space, including established market players PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Skrillex, in addition to PayPal's service, Venmo, which is currently cost-free for bank account transfers and enjoys a high level of stickiness in its customer base due to the associated benefits of an integrated social network. The service is already popular among millenials.Square Stand is another product designed for business transactions, by allowing an Apple iPad to be swiveled around from seller-to-customer as a point of sale item. The product has a neat design, but it's highly questionable how much demand there is for this product going forward or how much value-add it can reasonably offer a business.(Source: squareup.com)The company also provides service offerings through a suite of CRM/customer engagement tools (""Square Customer Engagement""), including an email marketing system, and a payroll service for businesses. Again, it is difficult to determine how these services will capture significant market share in an already saturated space. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) are the clear leaders in this vertical. If we were to measure the popularity of the top ten CRM players by the number of social followers, in order, it goes:(Source: softwareadvice.com)In terms of number of users, Salesforce, Microsoft, and Oracle's two CRM products take up over 50% of the market share.Square's acquisition of Caviar in August 2014 showed a desire to venture into meal delivery, with a focus on higher-end restaurants. Competition is also picking up in this space. Many believe Uber will become a - or the - dominant force in this industry as a logical extension of its already popular ride-sharing service. Delivering meals provides one well-envisioned broadening of the company's service offerings beyond the on-demand taxi business model. A major, highly integrated tech power, such as Google, may also have interest in becoming involved in this area as well if it makes business sense.I believe Square Capital represents the company's strongest leg of innovative potential. The segment is unique in that it offers business loans that are repaid as a percentage of the loan acquirer's credit card sales rather than the typical path of along a fixed time schedule. Businesses may be more attracted to this model as it better aligns their interests with the lender. If the business generates revenue, Square directly benefits in proportion, as opposed to adopting the standard lending model where it makes a prediction that the interest charged on the loan will outweigh any credit risk (i.e., default risk) assumed by entering the transaction. In many respects, it brings a venture capital-like flavor to the traditional lending market.All Square Capital loans are issued through Celtic Bank, a Utah-Chartered Industrial Bank and member of the FDIC. There are certain stipulations that must be met. First, to qualify, a business must be a Square Merchant (i.e., use Square's services), and is subject to certain other conditions regarding processing volume (e.g., $10,000 or more in annual sales), customer diversity, and is in other respects a fundamentally sound, growing business.Accordingly, out of the products and services encapsulated within Square's business model, I have the highest hopes for Square Capital and recognize the value of its integration within the rest of the business as a means of scaling. But I generally have a high level of skepticism regarding many of its other offerings in terms of obsolescence risk and market penetration. Square's unique products may likely not generate sufficient demand as everyday business necessities and conceivably represent fleeting innovations and lack much in the way of foreseeable long-term demand. Its competitive offerings in other verticals, such as customer relationship management software, will have great difficulty in attracting significant market share and, as a whole, the company lacks much in the way of competitive insularity in the increasingly competitive merchant services vertical."

In fact, the stock has mostly traded within the range of the first trading day.Unlike the other hot private stocks in the prior years, Square came public reasonably priced. The IPO pricing of $9 per share instantly set what has mostly held as the floor for the stock. Though, the amount of diluted shares outstanding has worked to constrain any rallies in the stock.The quarterly results for Q2 were again strong in comparison to estimates. The company continues to lose money, but the market is starting to better understand the adjusted revenues metric. This revenue metric that excludes the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) revenues and transactions costs surged over 50%.A big aid to the growth in the company is the ability of the management team to expand the total addressable market. Square has gone from a mobile payments provider of the small mom and pop businesses to one moving up the chain into businesses with in excess of $500,000 in annual gross payment volumes.Source: Square Q216 shareholder letterAt the same time, Square has found a way to provide working capital to businesses the company helps process payments. The transactional insight into the business makes the loans lower risk.The ability to capture new business opportunities is why investing in a management team is sometimes more crucial than the original business concept.The biggest hiccup to the investment thesis remains the massive diluted share count. Square listed 334 million shares outstanding with the Q2 report. The company listed the following amount with the last 10-Q.Source: Square Q116 10-QThe nearly 124 million shares not listed in diluted share counts since the company isn't profitable is a massive hidden impact to future earnings. Square actually has the potential for over 450 million diluted shares outstanding. The end result is a stock worth closer to $5.0 billion and not the listed $3.9 billion.The confusing share counts and adjusted revenues are most visible in the following P/S ratio chart. A lot of the market data picks up the total revenues that include transaction costs and Starbucks revenue that is going away soon. At the same time, the crucial market valuation isn't pulling in the true value that includes an incredible amount of stock options.Using the high-end guidance for adjusted revenues of $670 million combined with the fully diluted market valuation of $4.95 billion, Square actually trades for roughly 7.4x projected sales forecasts.The key investor takeaway is to keep an eye on the true share count and market valuation. For this reason, Square is difficult to chase. The stock looks appealing on a dip back to $10.50 to close the gap from surge following the earnings report."

At issue is that the majority of Square's clientele - 88% - is small businesses with annual incomes under $500,000, and its biggest client, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), just pulled the plug.

One of those strategies appears to be streaming content, this time with the NBA. Previously, Twitter had taken up deals with the NFL to stream games, but this deal will be somewhat different.Twitter will stream non-game programming, which will include a pre-game show and a so far, unannounced other show as well.While it's still unknown if Twitter's efforts in the video-streaming world will help boost MAUs, other companies, particularly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), have high hopes for live video going forward.Square Eyes EuropeSticking with Jack Dorsey, let's focus on his other publicly-traded company, Square (NYSE:SQ).

It marked the worst trading day of 2016 for the video-streaming giant.But is the fall enough to slow the stock's decline? Shares are now down 25% on the year and worries persist over its ability to grow its user base, especially considering its valuation, at 266 times earnings.Although Netflix topped earnings per share estimates and reported in-line revenue expectations, the company badly missed on subscriber estimates. The company expected to add 500,000 new subs in the U.S. this quarter, down nearly 50% from the 900,000 it added in the same period last year. Instead, Netflix added just 160,000 while international subscriber results of 1.5 million came in below the company's prior estimate of 2 million.As a result, analysts are slashing their earnings estimates while Seeking Alpha contributors are out with a slew of new takes. We have Peak Netflix, No More Monopoly and Why It's A Good Buy.But Maybe the Company Will Be Okay?Although Netflix clearly got a big thumbs down from investors Tuesday - and really, it deserves it after missing so atrociously on subs growth - it does have some things going for it headed into the second half of 2016 and into 2017.For one, the company announced early Monday that it would ""be the exclusive streaming source for the new Star Trek series in 188 nations outside the U.S and Canada."" Netflix also has its streaming partnership with Disney (NYSE:DIS) kicking in later this year too.Adding to the content mix, but surely not enough to significantly soften the blow of Tuesday's selloff, Netflix also announced it will continue with the ""Making a Murderer"" series. The previous season garnered over 19 million viewers and the company is hoping to build on that momentum.Will There Be an iPhone 7 Pro?Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rumors are far from a rare thing these days, especially considering that the Silicon Valley giant has become larger, fiscally speaking, than many countries.Some investors are focused on the company's upcoming earnings report on Tuesday, July 26th, but it already seems like the majority of the focus is on Apple's upcoming iPhone, due out in a few months.Reports are now suggesting that there isn't going to be an iPhone Pro announced when the new lineup is introduced in September. Two code names, ""Sonora"" and ""Dos Palos,"" indicate that a lacking third code name implies that the Pro isn't making the final cut.

Instead it's - you guessed it - cybersecurity.Munich Re, the world's second largest reinsurer, found that in 55% of survey respondents, corporate risk managers were most worried about the cybersecurity of autonomously-operated vehicles. Given that there is currently no definitive cybersecurity prevention for automated cars, this field is ripe for potential - and for danger.Assigning liability between an autonomously-driven vehicle and human-driven vehicle was the second-largest concern among risk managers.Baidu Faces Investigation Over Potential Gambling PromotionsShares of Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) took a slight hit Tuesday, falling 2.2% after the Cyberspace Administration of China said it would launch a ""strict investigation"" into whether the Chinese search giant was used by illegal gambling sites to promote their operations.Shares of Baidu have already been under pressure, stumbling more than 14% this year and roughly 36% from its highs made in late-2014, after the issues that arose from Baidu not disclosing its paid and non-paid-for search results. The new limitations weighed on the company's most recent guidance.According to Baidu, the company is cooperating with authorities, but declined to comment publicly on the case. The CAC has said it will ""handle any illegal behavior accordingly."" Currently, Chinese search engines are to refrain from promoting these online gambling outfits.Baidu Investors Have Questions TooIt's not just the Cyberspace Administration that has questions for Baidu, but its investors do as well.The company's considered sale of video-streaming platform iQiyi.com to another group is considered ""far too low"" by Acacia Partners, a shareholder in the company. Perhaps making matters worse yet - or at least more questionable - is that this ""group"" trying to buy the video unit is being led by its Chairman Robin Li.The hedge fund argues that the unit is worth $5.8 billion, more than double the $2.8 billion offer that was submitted by Li and Yu Gong, the latter of whom serves as the CEO of iQiyi.com.Because it competes with Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), Baidu has made the case that the unit's rising costs are a hindrance to its bottom line. Still, it seems somewhat odd that, despite the rising costs, the company would want to exit the video space at a time where many others are looking to get involved. The Chinese online video market is also expected to triple by 2018, according to iResearch, making for another head-scratcher.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

(NYSE:SQ) has been nothing short of a roller coaster, trading in a volatile range between $8.06 and $15.99, with the price currently consolidated above $9.50, not far from the November IPO price and my initial price target of $9, which was outlined in my original article (available to PRO subscribers). A great deal of effort was spent highlighting an extensive list of issues related to the capital structure, business model, and the competitive environment of SQ, including the long line of ancillary products and services leveraging the company's core transactions-based, point of sales ""POS"" revenue model. With a lack of barriers to entry and a large dependency on its low-margin transaction-based revenue, SQ is left financially and heavily reliant on small- to medium-sized enterprises ""SMEs,"" which are historically very cyclical and carry substantial going concern issues at all times. The main transactions business of SQ lives and dies by the success or failure to achieve uninterrupted hyper-scale growth, while the firm stretches itself thin to grow multiple ancillary products, with the aspiration to create a global end-to-end solutions platform to diversify the obvious structural problems and naturally low margins related to SQ's transactions-based business model. CEO Jack Dorsey is faced with the daunting task of quickly growing ancillary revenues to a meaningful level and managing rapidly growing costs, all while splitting his time between two high-profile and troubled public companies.SQ's easy-to-implement, on-the-go payment solution has solved a long-standing void in the payments market (evident from healthy growth in GPVs, ""Gross Payment Value""), while 7 years of intense marketing has created a very recognizable brand among both consumers and sellers. Recent brick-and-mortar relationships with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Target (NYSE:TGT) to sell their POS hardware to retail customers is a testament to the growing strength of the brand, but also the very limited client base it can serve (SMEs, 85% >$500K GPV a year). What started out as a small plug-in device inserted into a smartphone, enabling payments to be sent and received quickly outside of the traditional stationary point-of-sales ""POS"" model, has quickly evolved into a long list of various SaaS ancillary services revolving around human resource, back office analytic services, and a direct lending businesses called Square Capital, in an attempt to achieve aspirations of being a full-scale end-to-end service provider.Besides facing a massive amount of competition in each product and service category, in Q1 the company dedicated an incredible amount of resources (1.43X Gross Profits - see ""Expense Analysis"" section below for breakout), both in the form of financial & human capital for product development, as well as large marketing costs attempting to create a long list of ways to be a full-scale, healthy, well-diversified end-to-end payment and business management solutions provider with much stronger margins. Square is spending 90% of its resources on what right now still makes up only less than 15% of the potential annual revenue well into its life cycle as a company. This is a classic Silicon Valley cash burning, ""transformative opportunity"" story pitched to public investors to buy what at best is a coin flip in a brutally competitive arena, where the profitable market opportunity has yet to be scaled, proven, leveraged, and tested on a multi-year level (Software, Services, Cash advance/Lending). The only investors who will benefit are the private investors who got in early (many of which have guaranteed return clauses associated with their shares), and executives who are being paid ridiculous amounts of stock-based compensation to make up for a part-time CEO and co-founder, while overcompensating the impressive list of talent for taking the risk to join the firm.In addition to this, Square generates very thin gross margins (30%), while operating costs explode faster than top line growth, which further fuel negative operating margins (a dangerous combination of factors) and targets set on adjusted EBITDA terms, instead of focusing on generating real economic free cash flow, ""FCF,"" to which the company lost $25 million in Q1. While SQ Capital's credit risk is transferred to 3rd-party investors who buy the income streams (and now loans), the potential for a snowball on a negative slope leaving Square naked against a sharp reversion of demand for this kind of credit paper is inevitable and will stall the availability to sellers in an environment where they would need it the most (recessionary).It seems that SQ has a lot going for it (by just briefly glancing at its growth rates and overall market size), but when one peels back the layers, one finds that the core of the business is plagued by a variety of different aforementioned fundamental issues. The phrase ""Great Product, Terrible Stock"" sums it up in a few words. Investors have given SQ a second chance at life in a more risk-on environment, but the smoke and mirrors can only hold up for so long.In this article, we break down Q1 2016 earnings, Q2 expectations, and review the business model, valuation, and competitive position of SQ, in order to gain a better understanding of the risk/reward equation since my last article now that we have a couple quarterly reports to judge as a public company. My original thesis has hit the $9 price target multiple times (well within the 6-month outlook), providing investors who followed me a current 20-30% gain (40-60% annualized), and even more if they followed my recommended option strategy (200-450%).It seems the downside opportunity has played out with regard to risk/reward, and the short-term market environment (now ""risk-on"") is setting SQ up for a potential temporary rise in price, or a sharp drop if numbers and guidance miss. Investors are best served sitting on the sidelines, while traders can take advantage of a wide trading range. I am upgrading my rating to ""Hold,"" with the potential SQ's story can keep it floating above the $10-12 a share level going into the company's seasonally strong second half until hyper-scale growth no longer feeds the narrative's fire and the smoke fades away.As a bonus, we provide a neutral-based strategy using options for investors who like to speculate, or who don't mind shorter time horizons. With a high short interest, earnings due to report on August 3rd, and a steady rebound of 10% off Brexit lows, the potential for a short-term jump in price or another post-earnings sharp drop is better than average, but the overall risk/reward for a position in either direction is relatively unfavorable given the disconnect between fundamentals and the ""story"" being sold to the public.Q1 2016 Financial Highlights include:(Source: Author using Company Data from Q1 Letter)GPVs grew to $10.3 billion in Q1. While that represents a 43% Y/Y increase, sequentially they remained rather flat (seasonality). What is disturbing as a trend, and the reason I am highlighting this area is to show how as a % of GPV, transaction margins are shrinking. On a Y/Y basis, GPV went from earning 111 Bps to 103 Bps, an 8% decline in Gross profits generated per $1 transacted. This is a clear indication that SQ has, in many ways, managed to grow at rates most management teams would envy, while simultaneously destroying the incremental economic value created through 43% Y/Y GPV growth. In turn, this is creating a situation where as the company grows, economies of scale are failing to work in its favor, with already weak barriers to entry against much larger competitors.This has a lot to do with GPV Mix By Seller Size:In Q1, over 88% of SQ's customers make less than $500K a year in revenue, and 60% make less than 125K, leaving me to question on what financial strength SQ expects its sellers to afford all these ancillary services the company is so heavily investing in, and so proudly touting as the REAL investment opportunity? While SQ has created an enjoyable experience, larger firms such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have their own capable solutions, command lower rates per transaction, and earn more at their end. The lack of margin expansion, or additional leverage being gained as SQ scales, is a clear indication profitability will be lackluster, to say the least, especially at the rate cap ex and operating expenses have grown. The failure to retain SBUX is a clear indication enterprise solutions isn't a realistic expectation, especially with so much competition across every aspect of SQ's current and future business model.Revenue Analysis(Source: Company 10-Q)There is no doubt that SQ has maintained very high top line growth rates. Whether you look at it on a net revenue, adjusted, or gross basis, however you cut it, the company has delivered healthy growth, and I expect that trend to continue for at least another year, as the base has room to go before the law of large numbers wakes them up. However, once you look past that, you realize that all the growth is burned away on the multitude of expansion projects meant to create an experience that doesn't seem to translate into profits. You also have to consider that when deceleration occurs, we will quickly see it tumble, since the current rates are so high (Y/Y comps will reflect poorly). While total net revenue grew 51%, there is absolutely no gross margin improvement, on top of expenses far outweighing any Gross Profit. These growth rates won't and can't be sustained on the top or in the middle, which is why taking a close look at cost of revenue and operating expenses is so important.Cost of Revenue(Source: Company 10-Q)On a net basis, hardware sales increased over 600%, but generated a loss of over $10 million, which is essentially part of customer acquisition costs. The hardware was what originally gave the company a competitive advantage by creating a on-the-go POS, and now a stationary portal enabling EMV and NFC, and through which the seller connects to the many services through one easy-to-use platform, making it very user friendly (SQ has great customer feedback).Software and data products produced a net profit of $14 million, thanks to the incredibly high margins that come along with the variety of secondary offerings. A large portion of these revenues and associated cost are coming from SQ Capital and Caviar (SQ's food delivery service similar to GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB). While the entire future story is based on this line item growing to become a healthy portion of total revenue, the amount of resources required to accomplish this mission far outweigh any near- or even medium-term levels SQ can achieve to justify the levels of capital allocation or investor enthusiasm. After adjusting for the loss of SBUX at the end of Q3, things look even worse regarding any hope of enterprise-level sellers taking interest in SQ. This makes the company tremendously vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the overall macro environment in the small business community.Overall weak gross margins don't support the aggressive growth strategy and the costs of acquiring growth by giving away as much as you can for free. SQ is betting that selling you its POS system terminal at a loss to attract the seller to its ecosystem will then pay off through a number of secondary services. While hardware costs aren't necessarily material, the mentality about them is certainly a valid concern looking into the future.Expense Analysis(Source: Company 10-Q filing)For every $1 in Gross Profit earned ($110 million in Q1), SQ spent $1.42 in operating expenses, including stock-based compensation (excluding one-time items). In general and administrative expenses, a one-time expense of $50 million is included from an IP legal settlement. The cost of innovation in Silicon Valley is notoriously expensive, and SQ is no exception. In order to really understand the future economic picture of the company, you have to strip out and analyze expenses each on an individual basis, as well as a collective basis, to determine if it will ever reach a positive NPV on its invested capital and if they are reasonable as a % of revenue. Many of my criticisms can be easily observed in the Operating Expense section. This exorbitant compensation structure can also be observed at Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), a testament that increased compensation doesn't yield better results relative to available talent, associated innovation, and turnover prevention. It is also an indication that SQ will be anything but a ""tightly run ship,"" which is something much needed with margins that leave absolutely no room for error.Here is a breakdown analysis of each material operating expense:Product Development - Costs 80% of Profits, Generates 10% of RevenueSales, Marketing, and General Admin - Commercials Aren't CheapTransaction and Advance Losses - Square Capital's Flawed HopesIn order to drive the necessary hyper growth (50% 4-year top line CAGR), serious investment needs to be made in the company's human capital, both on the marketing and sales side. You may have noticed plenty of TV commercials over the last year or two, pushing SQ as an easy-to-use mobile POS system. As the company transitions after SBUX, I expect Jack Dorsey to focus on trying to connect and replace it with some type of enterprise client, which would help validate that level of capability. Without SBUX (which financially proved to be more of a cost than a benefit), the entire client base is SMEs, more than half of which only gross $125K or less. This is where massive scale becomes costly, as the firm will constantly need to not only replace regular ""churn,"" but will also need to continue to grow at insane rates for years to come, in order to make the business model work.One instance is examining the growth in losses from transactions and cash advances on a multi-year basis. Square Capital is the firm's cash advance service, which charges very high interest rates and has a constant need of outside investor capital to fund it. It has now transitioned to regular small business loans, but has kept the high rates. One of the many risks inherent in this business model is the credit risk passed from the seller to SQ, and down to the investor. In addition, prepayment risk will now be an issue for the credit investors, transitioning from cash advance to small business loan CF structures. As the services grow, regardless of their ""proprietary underwriting"" capabilities, economic downturns and other factors that affect SMEs will one day pose a serious threat, in which case SQ will face losses of both sellers as well as demand from the investor side of the equation.Financial Analysis and ResultsAlthough the company would need to disclose it regardless, from the very beginning SQ has provided details and reconciliations for adjusted numbers to reflect the expected SBUX transition. GPVs are the main growth metric representing the pool of transaction volume that results in 90% of the revenue base.The main issue with the way SQ calculates Adjusted revenue is that it is a bit misleading when comparing the reason for presenting this figure versus the actual economic value it represents. By removing SBUX results, as well as transaction costs, you arrive at the level of revenue expected to be earned on a long-term basis, net of the fees and, most importantly, post SBUX.Adjusted Revenue(Source: Company 10-Q)Here's the trick - While the company adjusts for transaction costs, it neglects to include software and hardware costs, which doesn't make much sense if the number is really just meant to reflect the economic impact of losing SBUX as a client. If it were to subtract hardware costs to earn that transaction revenue, adjusted revenue net of SBUX looks even worse for the company. Problem is, the true economic revenue figure is more appropriately reflected as GAAP Gross Profit less revenue from SBUX. Since Net revenue includes both software and hardware revenue, it would only make sense the company matches the associated costs in the figure to reflect a more accurate picture of ""Adjusted Revenue."" Only SBUX-related revenue should be removed, since the basis of this presentation is to show how the loss of SBUX will impact the future. Net of hardware and software costs necessary to generate any transaction revenue, SQ earned about $110 million, after earning over $300 million from its GPVs, and $30 million lower than what SQ presents as ""Adj. Revenue"". This is why the company's expenses sitting at 1.43X gross profit is a serious issue.Adjusted EBITDA(Source: Company 10-Q)A reconciliation of EBITDA from GAAP to Non-GAAP reveals an easy way to highlight some key expenses and costs. Two items that display the careless, and expensive human capital are the massive increase in share-based compensation expense, as well as depreciation and amortization, which arise from the millions of dollars poured into R&D to develop IP and technology to hopefully one day pivot away from the company's captive revenue stream. Jack Dorsey recruited a very talented, and thus expensive, executive team at SQ, which is an additional cost to his split tenure as the CEO of two publicly traded, struggling companies, TWTR and SQ.When observing the numbers, obvious flaws are difficult to ignore and become a dangerous trap in this environment. Well-known overall Silicon Valley valuation adjustment across the board for all profit-lacking promises of a robust and successful long-term story have been out of favor and, from time to time, may catch some wind, but ultimately fail to reach previous levels. Essentially, the unicorn card is on very thin ice these days, so paying close attention to the numbers is key. What we will notice is SQ provides adjusted numbers, and from the beginning, has disclosed that Starbucks, its largest customer making up almost half its transaction volume, intends to end the relationship when the agreement ends September 30, 2016.Now that we have combed through the results line by line, quick glances could fool investors into thinking the hyper growth in revenue (40% CAGR over 4 years) is evidence of progression toward a full end-to-end (not just transaction-based) payment solutions company well on its way to generating a positive EBITDA, FCF and, eventually, Net Income (an actual profit). It's only when you examine all the layers to the story and all the numbers do you discover the story and growth can be a bit deceitful in a number of ways, while profitability remains far in the distance.Broken Business Model - Inevitable Market Forces ApproachingThe last round of financing had SQ valued at over $15 a share (December 14), leaving multiple levels of preferred shareholders with ratchet agreements (guaranteed returns or additional shares promised if ""underwater"" post IPO by a certain date), severely underwater, and public shareholders on the hook for SQ's valuation issues pre-IPO.The first sign of trouble was the manner in which SQ's valuation was treated once filing to go public, which revealed the lack of interest and skepticism on behalf of the markets regarding its cost and revenue ambitions. If the company really had a solid business model, it wouldn't have taken a 30% discount during its IPO process in order to meet demand and raise the necessary funds. Private investors were certainly urging for an exit, and the process as well as shareholder structure reveals it. Wall Street surprisingly seems to be letting Jack Dorsey slide with very little scrutiny over some very obvious problems, while choosing to endorse the false hope of prosperity because the top line remains in a hyper-growth stage, and the promises paint a vision of a totally different business. I also believe the massive media coverage and negativity surrounding Twitter and its severe management issues are being closely observed and questioned related to Jack Dorsey's dual-CEO role at SQ. At the same time, it takes the attention off SQ, allowing the company to avoid drawing more criticism. While being two different businesses, both are highly dependent on massive amounts of user growth. SQ only has a few quarters where it can still experience these levels of growth, eventually running into very similar, unsolved issues at the CEO's ""other"" company, while it hides in the shadow of TWTR's failures.With massive entities like Visa (NYSE:V), PayPal, MasterCard (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP), First Data (FDC), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), just to name a few, competing in different ways with SQ, growth will eventually drop to a much lower run rate, leaving its capital-intensive business model to compete solely to retain transaction revenue (the lowest-margin, highest-cost revenue stream). Ancillary services still aren't meaningful. I can't begin to list off the number of SaaS providers in the market for medium-to-large enterprises, as well as small businesses in terms of HR, Digital Receipts, Payroll, Accounting/Reporting, and analytical services (just to name a few) that exist in the marketplace.A complete list of each service, associated benefits and costs, and customer benefits have been provided in the first article. Since the beginning of the year, SQ has announced a number of new initiatives and services, further expanding and investing in ancillary services to upsell its current 2 million+ active sellers. SQ estimates there are 20 million businesses alone in the US that have unfulfilled needs with regard to accepting electronic payment, and along with the basic business management software, tailored to the average user. The hope is that as sellers grow, they would potentially evolve into using various SaaS products for human resources, cash management, same-day cash clearance, marketing, back office functions, as well as available liquidity through cash advances, and SQ's new service for small business loans, in addition to a direct move against PYPL, by now offering direct online cash payment services to merchants. The story has suddenly been retailored, where SQ is attempting to transform into an end-to-end global business solutions platform with a suite of services and products that fit the needs of millions of sellers. The goal is to upsell, grow, and enhance the chances for sellers to achieve success (which is the essential outcome SQ's existence depends upon). It is obvious why SQ needs its clients to achieve success (and furthermore perceive that success as a function largely in part due to using various SQ SaaS and cash loan/advance products and services).By leveraging deep-rooted technology, massive product development expenses, and an array of SaaS services that are all geared to add to the service of a POS system, the company hopes the brand and customer loyalty will beat the statistics that 50% of the sellers will go under after a couple of years (a known fact among small businesses). The main issue is, less than 10% of all gross revenue comes from anything but cards getting swiped or phones getting scanned, yet in comparison, nearly all efforts are focused on expanding services by plowing brain power and money in an effort to steal market share away from very established players, as well as many new entrants like AMZN, which already tells you enough about the competitive landscape. Thus far, SQ has been able to grow quickly with small businesses, but larger operations have proven unsuccessful, indicating the level of sophistication and client needs will most likely never reach the level of scale for the company to create enterprise-focused products and a well-balanced revenue stream with significantly higher margins and FCF generation.The Serious Risk, Not Opportunity: Square CapitalThe most prevalent issues aside expense management are related to Square Capital, including its new small business lending service, which is an additional layer of complex credit risks (including securitized consumer credit paper), regardless of ""abundant client data for underwriting."" As we recently saw with the Lending Club scandal, the waters are fairly new territory and full of uncertainty (opportunity as well).(Source: Company S1 Filing)As SQ looks for ways to maximize the value of each customer, it has entered into the market of cash advances. Everyone knows the biggest issue that plagues SMEs is liquidity. SMEs must constantly reinvest to grow, but unfortunately, many times the cash cycle of a firm and the cash requirement do not align easily, leaving them in need to fill the gaps. By providing short-term liquidity to sellers against their receivables, SQ is able to collect a substantial return, as depicted in the above picture. Any prospective investor must wonder, though, what value are these services adding to SQ's customers, besides plugging the hole, if the interest rates are in the double digits? In order to borrow $10,000, one must pay back $11,300 (a whopping 13% expense on the cash, even worse if you annualize it). Most businesses love this feature (because credit is difficult to attain), which has led to the creation of a small business loan option, selling the paper to investors like hedge funds in order to provide their clients with revolving credit terms.While this may seem like a great opportunity, as it scales the law of large numbers will subject SQ to a variety of risks and issues, such as:These are just a few of the many concerns that come to mind, especially in such a low-margin business. As we will see in the next section, SQ - like any other hyper-growth dependent Silicon Valley startup - is heavily dependent on product development, sales & marketing expenses, and attractive compensation packages required to retain top talent.Price Performance and Price TargetTechnical Outlook and SetupIn the comments section of my previous article, on May 17th, 2016, the price of SQ closed at $9.18, fulfilling my original thesis. Readers were thus advised and updated that I was closing my position out, and that SQ should now be considered a ""Hold,"" unless you are a short-term trader. This brief analysis will lay out now the crucial technical point that has built up clearly in anticipation of an important earnings report, and even more important, guidance for the rest of 2016.The chart is clearly indicating a variety of longer-term bullish signals, while flashing signs of ""overbought."" Technical analysis isn't a science, but rather, an additional tool useful in gauging market sentiment, momentum, and investor behavior. Currently, the 50-day and 20-day SMAs (simple moving averages) are testing a ""golden cross."" Although the RSI indicates overbought, the 2-month period of consolidation around the base formed and the clear ""U""-shaped double bottom have led to a double-digit rebound to break $10 and establish new ""resistance and support levels,"" flashing ""recovery"" signs and a potential short squeeze. While I remain adamant that the risk reward related to the unpredictability of SQ, and the need for hope to drive value rather than profit, investing at this moment is potentially either a short bullish breakout or a hype-built trap about to reveal all the issues I have discussed this year. The only likely conclusion I can reach is that the market will ""re-price"" SQ post earnings, and the move will be similar to the one we saw after Q1 earnings in May.Opportunistic Trade For Q2 Earnings and BeyondBy nature I am a longer-term investor, but I certainly look for opportunities to take advantage of shorter-term opportunities such as the one described above, which is a volatile directional reaction post earnings. To limit risk, I recommend a Long Strangle Option Strategy:You can also play this with a Long Straddle, which is the same idea as a Long Strangle, except you buy both the Call and Put option at the SAME strike. The trade-off is you pay more in premium, but you don't need as dramatic of a move in the same time period.Investors should also be aware of what's called a ""volatility crush."" The price of options rise (implied volatility specifically rises ""IV"") as we approach earnings or other important events expected to move the price of a security. For example, the $11 call option for September has an IV of 53 (closer to historical averages), while the August IV is 70 for the $11 call option. After earnings, most likely the August IV will drop closer to 60 and below, affecting both legs of the trade. You can mitigate this by paying more premium for time, and buying the September contracts instead of August.Either way you decide to approach it, you have to believe with conviction the price is getting ready to ""break out"" in either direction and make a significant move. The good news is total loss of capital is unlikely, as one leg will likely gain value, but may not cover the cost of the other leg in order to make a profit, with some time value left over until expiration. The above suggested trades are useful for a neutral bet on an individual security. You are betting that the stock is going to make a dramatic move, but you don't know if it's going to be up or down - you just believe it will be more than what the market is pricing within a given time period. It's a risk-averse way to make a neutral bet on an individual security's direction. It corresponds to my thesis on SQ being a ""Hold"" until we reach better risk/reward levels.Be sure to click on the links for more fundamental information on each strategy, and especially how IV will be impacted before and after earnings (the volatility crush).Q2 2016 GuidanceDue to a lack of positive FCF and/or EBITDA, the most logical way to value SQ is using a Price-to-Sales ratio, since the entire growth story is 100% dependent on a ridiculous amount of GPV volume growth required to keep this poorly constructed business model afloat as the company continues to rapidly expand and spend to acquire a large volume of sellers.It is also prudent to compare SQ to some of its competitors, in order to gauge on a relative basis reasonable valuation multiples. SQ expects to break even by year end on an adjusted EBITDA level, but that doesn't mean much if stock-based compensation remains this high.(Source: Motley Fool)Above we have a comparative chart pegging SQ against its biggest competitor, PYPL. With a market cap of $44 billion (EV $39 billion) versus SQ's $3.27 billion (EV $2.98 billion), the competition is clearly miles ahead of SQ, thanks to its 15+ year life, long-standing brand recognition, scale that has afforded the company a reasonable 15% profit margin, and the ability to compete against SQ directly at a better price (50 Bps to the seller).On the other hand, the company is a long way from making a profit (-25% profit margin). Management has guided for a full-year breakeven point, and $625 million at the midpoint of Adj. revenue. That places SQ currently at 5x expected 2016 Adj. revenue. We discussed why I feel the way SQ calculates ""Adj. revenue"" is a bit pointless, but for the sake of simplicity, we will stick with what management guides and still see that the valuation is already quite large. SQ has a good chance of beating expectations on the top line and achieving Adj. revenue of $640-650 million for FY 2016. As discussed in the first article, a potential one-time loss on certain guaranteed returns promised to private shareholders that will be based on SQ's share price. At $10 a share, currently a one-time loss of roughly $16 million potentially lingers. If SQ manages to regain its mojo for a bit and avoids any further large one-time expenses, it should be able to break even on an Adj. EBITDA level (stock-based comp will prevent the company from breaking even on a GAAP basis for at least 3 more quarters), leaving some hope left in the story, which is enough in this environment to sustain what is clearly anything but a hopeful future.With that being the case, assuming 5X EV/Sales is ""reasonable,"" in conjunction with the company's growth rate, then SQ's FV should be no more than $3 billion EV, which puts it roughly between $10 and $10.50. This is assuming no discount for all the various issues this article has discussed. Since the competition is much larger and SQ is very new to the market, the story and related results are what will really determine what the market is willing to pay. We saw this as SQ had to cut its valuation 30% from $12 a share to $9 a share to come public, and 2 subsequent retracements back to that level.In my first article, I argued that $9 a share was the ""full"" value, and that the stock would ultimately test those levels due to the heavy losses being sustained and the incredible amount of investments in product development yet to produce a healthy return. Ultimately, the thesis played out, and now it's time to sit back and let the story play out a bit before committing to a directional play.ConclusionIn both research reports, I go into great detail to break down the ""smoke and mirror""-type presentation from management that attempts to deflect the conversation over credit risks, excessive costs for ancillary software development, high risks/unproven business in SQ Capital, and many more items that make the company no different than the many failed public dead unicorns. Buying a public company in the hope that its complementary business model (outside the core revenue driver) becomes the main profit generator, without any long-term evidence of success, is a bad formula with a wide array of potential outcomes, especially if costs aren't drastically reduced. We broke down the numbers in detail, combed through the foggy hope-based future from management, and laid out an opportunistic way to approach a situation with a neutral bias (bonus for those who speculate). While I expect traders to make a nice profit from the market's volatility, in the long run the issues that SQ has have no easy solution and don't offer a proper risk reward for a long-term position for investors. Like many that came before, it's only a matter of time until the smoke and mirrors fade and the market loses faith in the story Jack Dorsey is trying to sell. In the mean time, it's best investors avoid the name until there is more concrete evidence SQ can become a profitable business with stable cash flows and stronger barriers to entry.***If you appreciated the above analysis, please be sure to tap the ""Follow"" button to stay up to date with all future publications.

If it wasn't for the shares coming onto the market that swamps the existing float, one has to wonder if the stock would have even traded down after Q1 results.At around $9, the stock trades near the post-IPO lows. Square spent most of April trying to hit new highs at $16 so the recent declines are a big hit to the stock.My post-earnings article hinted at this probable selloff providing an opportunity to buy Square below $10 as an opportunity. Any reason to abandon that recommendation now?Moving PartsWith any stock, many moving parts make the analysis very difficult in deriving the reasoning for stock moves. One prime way to review why a stock moved up or down after earnings is to see where analysts moved forward estimates after the results. Whether right or wrong, a big swing in EPS expectations usually dictates stock price moves.In the case of Square, analysts are actually forecasting a smaller loss for 2016 and a small profit for 2017. Both numbers are improvements over the expectations prior to the release of Q1 earnings.Source: Yahoo FinanceDespite some general misconceptions about the quality of the Q1 numbers, the mobile payments processor actually delivered a solid quarter. The analyst estimates confirm that the decline since the Q1 release is all noise related to misunderstanding Q1 numbers or the IPO lockup expiration.Lockup Expiration DetailsThe interesting part is that the lockup expiration appears to have a lot of noise and not much substance as well. At the time of the IPO, Square listed the following shares outstanding in the S-1.Regardless of the lockup expiration confusion, Square listed up to 440 million shares outstanding at the time of the IPO over 180 days ago. The lockup expiration makes it possible for more shareholders to unload shares, but most investors aren't going to find $9 per share appealing.The key is that Square mentioned 64 million stock options in the Q1 shareholders letter as exercisable as of the expiration date, but the reality is that over 300 million Class B shares become eligible for shareholders to unload. Most of those shares belong to executives, but about 47 million shares belong to VC firms that might dump the shares in the next year.The key to the stock options though is that the average exercise price is listed at $6.99 in the annual report. Owners of these stock options have limited reasons to exercise these options with the stock price near the exercise price. Not to mention, Square will collect nearly $7 for each option exercised providing more cash to run the company. The reason the company lists only 64 million options as exercisable is that over 35 million options at year-end have an average exercise price of $12.57.The reality is that only 5.5 million options were exercised last year while 9.8 million options were forfeited or canceled. In addition, the low stock price might cause some shares to not execute. Square listed nearly 10 million warrants with an exercise price of $10.92 that clearly won't occur at the current stock price.TakeawayThe key investor takeaway is that the recent drop in Square is related to irrational fear related to the known lockup expiration. Investors should use this opportunity to own the premium mobile payments solution provider below $10."
3992238,52712,2016-07-27T16:34:17-04:00,"Square trades at a very high premium valuation to its competitors.Large competitive headwinds from First Data and other merchant acquirers as Square moves upstream to larger merchants.Caviar (food delivery business) and Square Capital have much less scale than GrubHub and other lending platforms.Square offers its hardware for free or at costs below what it costs to manufacture it, limiting EBITDA margins.Stock-based compensation as a percent of sales rising and new acquisitions likely to continue diluting investors.","Square (NYSE:SQ) is a payments processing company, which enables anyone with a mobile device to accept card payments anytime and anywhere. Square generates the majority of its revenue from fees charged on payment volume with incremental revenue paid for software by their sellers. Square benefits from numerous trends in its favor, including the growth of payments by credit card as opposed to cash/check and the growing number of small and mid-sized businesses.However, at $10 per share, we feel this market opportunity is priced in, but the price ignores the numerous risks the business faces. Square has no clear path to profitability and is going to face increasing competition as it tries to enlist larger businesses, which are currently served by more intricate and better developed payment businesses. Additionally, investors have to accept this risk while paying a valuation much higher than that of Square's competitors to own shares of a company offering a commodity product.Brief Payment Process Overview: Square generates the majority of its revenue from payment processing and charges a fee typically 2.75% of payment volume for card present transactions or 3.5% of payment volume plus $.15 per transaction for card not present transactions. However, Square has to pay numerous parties including the acquiring processor (typically .15% of transaction value) and the issuing bank (1.5% of transaction value). Square settles transactions with merchants within one business day by Automated Clearing House (ACH) or same day via an instant deposit for an added fee. The full transaction cycle is depicted below.Source: Square 10-K FilingHigh Micro Merchant Competition: Ultimately, we feel the micro-merchant business has no significant barriers to entry. New payment companies are constantly emerging. For instance Clover First Data's (NYSE:FDC) square competitor came up on a recent mobile payment Google search and offers a nearly identical product to Square (see below). PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is also currently the major leader in online payments with approximately 184 million active PayPal accounts and 4.9 billion payments processed in 2015 through PayPal.PayPal offers an identical mobile payments reader and even charges 50 basis points less on their per swipe rate relative to Square. PayPal has assembled a very large online payments portfolio with its acquisitions of Venmo and Braintree. Given its much larger scale with a $45 billion market capitalization, it also can make much larger research and development investments and has the balance sheet to offer top engineering talent higher salaries relative to what they might receive working at Square doing similar work.Square states their competitive advantage rests in their technology and scale in their prospectus. However, PayPal has much greater scale and has invested much more in their technology and has a greater technology talent pool to pick from within their organization. Thus, we feel Square is likely to face increasing competition even within their core small business segment with numerous new start-ups offering mobile card readers likely to emerge.Source: Clover WebsitePricing Concerns In Mid-sized & Large Business Segments: We also believe Square will have trouble pricing their product effectively as they move to acquire larger merchants. As the average price tag of a merchant's goods increases, the traditional interchange plus pricing model becomes more attractive. MasterCard's (NYSE:MA) interchange fees are around 1.7% plus $.10 per transaction, in contrast to Square's static 2.75%.We understand there are small markup and network assessment charges in addition to this but the overall rate still ends up being greater when a larger merchant uses Square as opposed to a traditional merchant acquirer. Additionally, many merchant processors offer volume or value discounts, making a static pricing even less appealing. It is for this reason we see it unlikely that the greater than 500K GPV merchant (shown below) ever becomes a significant revenue stream for Square.Source: Square 10-K Filing/Author AnalysisHigh competition in all segments is likely to restrict any ability to raise prices and increase margins. The company has a history of losses, with a $212 million loss in 2015. The company also offers its readers for free or for newer chip readers at costs below that what it costs to manufacture them. To put this in perspective, hardware costs were $30 million in 2015 and hardware revenues were less than half of that amount. This inability to raise prices coupled with high hardware costs are likely to restrict margins into the foreseeable future.Most of Square's other business lines are relatively early stage (venture like) businesses within highly competitive segments. Caviar, shown below is still order of magnitudes smaller than GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), which recently purchased Seamless and charges customers for each delivery, a major negative in our view. The company also marks up food prices and charges a delivery and service fee compared to GrubHub where there is no markup.Square Capital also is a relatively small operation currently with major risks. Square Capital is dependent on third parties purchasing receivables and merchant loans, third parties may reduce the amount they are willing to pay for these loans and/or refuse to purchase the loans, which has happened historically. Square also offers limited information on these segments, limiting one's ability to evaluate them thoroughly as investments. All you can gauge is they make up a small portion of current revenue for the business but there is not enough detail to evaluate them as a reason for investing.The company appears dramatically overvalued relative to other companies offering similar mobile card readers. Square has negative operating margins and has no trailing enterprise value to EBITDA multiple, given its high costs. Analysts project a forward enterprise value to EBITDA multiple for 2016 of over two hundred times. If you are looking to invest in a payments company, why not look to invest in one that already has a feasible business model and margins. If you are looking for a venture capital type investment, then Square provides similar risk but the upside is only 20% in a perfect execution scenario as opposed to greater than 100% for successful venture deals.Their growing stock-based compensation (see below) also makes the premium valuation worse as investors are likely to continue to be diluted. This stock-based compensation increase will continue in order to retain talent and pursue acquisitions, which may or may not be accretive.Source: Author AnalysisSource: Author Analysis/Company FinancialsThe major risk to our thesis is Square being acquired. Currently, many smaller technology businesses are being acquired at substantial premiums seemingly out of nowhere, including LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and Outerwall (NASDAQ:OUTR) recently. We see this as unlikely given the commodity-like nature of their product, but it is a possibility.In conclusion, we feel Square is not an attractive investment opportunity for technology investors. The company faces intense competition within both the micro-merchant segment and will have pricing issues as it moves upstream to acquire midsized and large businesses as customers given interchange fees being more attractive.The company is very overvalued relative to its peers in terms of trading multiples and stock-based compensation is likely to continue its upward trend diluting investors. Given we see no clear path to profitability, we would suggest passing on shares until a major pullback and this becomes more of a value/distressed investment opportunity."
3995737,29591,2016-08-04T12:47:04-04:00,Mobile POS market expected to increase 400 pct by 2019.Square's EBITDA +$13 million in Q2 2016.The company is losing $2 for every $1 of hardware sales amidst a challenging credit market.Square still raising its full-year revenue guidance.,"Square Register allows individuals and merchants in the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia to accept offline debit and credit cards on iOS, Android smartphone or tablet computer. This fairly new application software supports manually entering credit card details on top of swiping the card through the small plastic device that plugs into the audio jack of any supported smartphone or tablet to read the magnetic strip. On the iPad version of the Square Register app, the interface resembles a traditional cash register.A report back in 2015 from 451 Research predicted that the global install base of mPOS will increase four times to just over 54 million units at a 32 percent compound annual growth rate in 2019, from the current 13 million devices on the market today. ""At a high level, there are more mobile lines than there are people and mobile phones are becoming ubiquitous,"" according to Jordan McKee, a senior analyst who covers mobile payments for 451 Research. At the 2015 National Retail Federation Big Show event in New York, Mobile Payments Today spoke to several mPOS providers who mentioned specialty retailers' desire to engage customers as they browsed a storefront rather than at traditional checkout areas. Mobile point of sales (mPOS) growth continues to accelerate as the technology expands and deepens its reach across vertical industries, merchants tiers and other geographies. Not to mention, rapid growth will be most evident in emerging economies where mPOS is playing a critical role in building electronic payments acceptance networks against a backdrop of rising card penetration. Both 451 Research and Transparency Market Research are expecting the Asia-Pacific region to become the largest mPOS market by 2020. The current dependence on cash-on-delivery for e-commerce transactions should also open the door for more mPOS development as credit and debit card penetration grows in India, exponentially.So where does that leave Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), you ask? Well Square's payments business, which accounts for almost all the company's revenues reported stronger-than-expected growth in Q1 2016 with revenues of $299m, which is up 45% from the previous year. Not to mention, Sarah Friar, chief financial officer at Square, says the company's user base had expanded to 2m active users. So with 13 million active users reported across the mPOS space by 451 Research in 2015, 2 million users accounted for by Square alone in 2016 would place the publicly traded company in a commanding lead, owning 15% market share in a fairly new and rising niche. So with that being said, Square continues to prove its dominance in the mPOS space as well by narrowing net losses further during its second quarter in 2016. Square posted a net loss of $27 million in Q2 2016, which is significantly less than the net loss of $97 million in Q1 2016. Square's EBITDA was also +$13 million in Q2 2016, which also exceeds the higher end of the company's projected gross revenue guidance and signals the company turning a profit sooner rather than later.However, not everything is perfect for Square so far. Mr. Jack Dorsey is still losing $2 for every $1 of hardware sales, as Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities says, ""The growth is coming from the wrong places."" Luria says, ""Lenders are no longer wanting to finance alternative lending."" Gil Luria continues on to say ""Investors are looking past the fast growth for Square's long-term viability and a lot of people are now hanging their hopes on the lending business, so Square highlighting a challenging credit market is a problem."" With hardware sales more than doubling from the fourth quarter to $16 million in Q1 2016, Square still sells its devices at a loss to gain new payment customers. The low-margin payments business is seen as more of an entry point for Square to attract new customers who can be persuaded to purchase additional services. And Square's Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar clarifies the language about a challenging credit market was included in the Q1 2016 earnings report just to reflect industry conditions. This ""challenge"" does not represent specific issues unique to Square, she says. Demand is strong for loans from Square customers and Square is said to have added two investors at the end of April that will increase funding for its lending program. Square is trying to shift all customers from advances to loans. Loans give businesses the flexibility to pay back balances more quickly than advances, which deduct payments from transactions until the balance is repaid. ""Q1 2016 was a really big quarter for laying a foundation for growth,"" Friar said, ""as Square converts more customers to loans.""So now ask yourself as an investor, how do I play this space? Square's shares jumped late Wednesday afternoon after the digital payments company raised its revenue guidance for 2016. It is truly a spectacle to every investor ready to buy this stock right now, that Square is raising its revenue guidance for 2016 despite the fact that its low-margin payments business is pushing the company in the other direction. The company still loses $2 for every $1 in hardware sales, however it still forecasted adjusted full-year revenue will be between $655 million and $670 million, up from a previous range of $615 million to $635 million. An analyst survey by FactSet had produced a consensus estimate of $642.6 million. For the second quarter 2016, Square reported a loss of 8 cents a share on adjusted revenue of $171 million. Analysts had estimated a loss of 11 cents a share on revenue of $157.8 million. And the mPOS business does not look like it is slowing down at all headed into the next decade for tech.So just imagine what happens next, once Square can begin shoring up its low-margin business in 2017 and eventually close its margin expense gap within its mPOS business? More individuals and merchants will continue to flock to low monthly maintenance mobile point of sales, as consumer growth in this niche definitely continues on an uptrend. So this stock in my humble opinion is a definite buy right here, ladies and gentlemen. Jack Dorsey got in at the bottom of mPOS and is flying high with Square at least until 2019."
3986732,99696,2016-07-06T18:34:44-04:00,"Square's revenue is mostly generated in the United States, but it quickly gaining a stronger footing in Canada and Japan.Square's potential in emerging markets is unparalleled, and is positioned to be the world's leader in promoting small businesses grow.Countries such as India are incredible opportunities for Square to be a dominating force in the transaction processing industry, especially at a post-Brexit discounted price of sub $10.","By Contributing Analyst Sean ReillyCorporate OverviewSquare's (NYSE:SQ) core business practices are currently centralized in the United States; the majority of the transaction processing company's annual revenue is generated domestically. However, it has successfully expanded to Canada and Japan and continues to grow on a global scale. Japan isn't an emerging market, but it served as a proving grounds for Square to learn and refine their international model, and create a plan of attack for the next frontier: BRIC. (Brazil, Russia, India, and China).One core facet of the short's thesis against Square is that the company may face adversity in trying to achieve consistent long-term profitability. This is supported by the idea that Square isn't the only dog in the kennel- in fact, with a market cap of just over 3 billion, the big dogs like Visa or Apple's payment transaction services may pose a dangerous threat to Square (say the shorts).However, the company is ambitious. They mention ""global expansion"" in their most recent 10-K, which spawned the idea for this piece: ""As this international base of sellers grows, so too should our Gross Payment Volume (GPV) and revenue in these regions. We serve sellers of all sizes, ranging from a single vendor at a farmers' market to multinational businesses. Our product and services are built to scale, so sellers can stay with us over the life of their businesses"". That sounds quite promising, but what merit does the statement hold if Square were to hypothetically enter a new (emerging) market, right this very minute?A Note On ""Good"" Versus ""Poor"" Emerging MarketsAfter doing some research, I've concluded that India and Brazil are likely more advantageous prospects than China or Russia for a number of reasons. China, for one, has an established competitor called QFPay. Not only that, but Square's expansion in China is also limited by the cap on transaction fees, which is a maximum of 0.78% (for reference, Square charges 2.75% per transaction). As for Russia, their annual GDP growth has contracted for the last 5 consecutive quarters. Therefore, Square's potential lies in the remaining two emerging markets in BRIC: Brazil and India.Recognizing potential obstacles and avoiding them effectively will be crucial for Square's success. I feel the company has started to understand this with their ventures abroad in Japan and Canada.Square's Uniqueness In Emerging MarketsBelow is a chart of India's consumer price index over the last 2 years. If nothing else, perhaps the graph might reveal the incredible promise that exists in India's economy and spending habits:Clearly, there is a consistent increasing trend in the index within the last 2 years in India. However, this is only made significant when connected with the following research: ""With total payments approaching $9 trillion, India's payments industry has revenues of nearly $14 billion. Payment flows are 7.8 times GDP ... Most of this derives from transaction banking, credit cards and cash and paper transactions (transaction banking includes cash management plus trade and supply-chain financing). The majority of payment flows occur to and within the business sector"" (Kamal, Thomas). The connection here is, not only is the consumer price index trending up, but India as a country is using credit cards and business transactions more often, which is great news for Square. One other plus for Square's presence in India is the fact that it doesn't have much competition. You may be thinking of Ezetap or similar startups at this point- realistically, no amount of Silicon Valley executives or their investments can elevate any similar businesses to Square's level of presence within a reasonable period of time. It is for the above reasons that Square will be able to dominate India's transaction processing market: they are an established, secure, cold-blooded and clean cut company that is serious about helping people start their businesses efficiently, and for cheap.Let's talk Brazil. Macroeconomically, their consumer confidence index looks extremely promising, with an increase of approximately 23.2% recently:This doesn't necessarily mean that Brazil is using more credit cards or banking, however. Because Square's bread and butter are transactions through purchases on credit, in order for Brazil to be a suitable target for expansion, its credit card penetration and banking presence must be on the rise. Visa's research on emerging markets in Latin America put Brazil in a solid position in terms of the likelihood of a bright, credit-based economic future. According to the report, it is the ""most trusting"" in terms of credit out of all of the Latin American countries they reported on, at 60%.Not only that, but Brazil was found to have the highest percent of ""financial consumers"", which they defined as individuals most trusting and involved in banking and financial practices, at 61%. These promising numbers make Brazil attractive to Square, again also because of Square's current advantage as the single established transaction payment processor that can expand to these promising countries.When expanding to the emerging markets like India and Brazil, Square will have the advantage over other transaction companies because of the sheer amount of services they offer, as well as the versatility in the types of plans they can sell as well. Data analytics, transaction processing, and even loans will be extremely attractive to aspiring entrepreneurs. Not only that, but the simplicity with which one can set up their business with Square, I believe, will prove to be a critical selling point for the company.A Realistic Long Position In A Promising CompanyApart from their potential in emerging markets, Square's financials are reasonable, particularly for such a young company. They've got no debt. They've had a consistent and solid increase their annual GPV (gross payment volume), which I expect to keep rising as they continue to establish themselves more:Reporting and speculation on Square's relationship with Starbucks has been beaten to death. It is true that it was not a positive financial influence on Square in the short-term. However, if not for the learning experience, simple association with Starbucks is worth something. Perhaps it is not tangible like the loss they took in the deal with the company, but their brand was certainly positively developed and grown in the eyes of the public. Given the amount of positive potential the company has, I believe the financials are at least passable for investors, given the potential for the business in various parts of the world.Overall, Square's value proposition doesn't lie in the fact that it allows one to process transactions on-the-go. As I've mentioned, many startups domestically and abroad can do the same thing. I see Square's real value and potential in the ways that the company can help one start a business from the ground up, for virtually nothing compared to the alternatives. Will QFPay, or hell, even Apple Pay, help you get a small loan so you can act on your idea for a business almost instantaneously? Will any of Square's competitors allow you to understand your customer's behaviors in immediate and meaningful ways? Will they help you establish virtual rewards programs or automated feedback systems so you can effectively improve your business? The answer is: no. This is where I believe Square's value proposition lies.Square's entire model is based on giving anyone with a passion for business the powerful tools they need to do so. This is the part of Square that truly shines, and sets it apart from its competitors.A Word On Dorsey, And Therefore RiskIt is important as an investor to be realistic. Global expansion is harder and more expensive than it sounds- and it sounds expensive in the first place. That being said, I don't worship Jack Dorsey. In fact, I don't think it's effective for Dorsey to run Square and Twitter at the same time. However, his and McKelvey's idea catalyzed something bigger than themselves, and I see potential- as many others do. In order for Square to succeed it will need to be run by someone with a combination of vision, but also someone with realistic and achievable goals as well. I see this in Dorsey, however if new management were to come about, this would not necessarily be a bad thing.ConclusionWe've already seen what Square can do domestically, and in established economies like Japan. In fact, I imagine that Square will be even more successful in emerging markets like India and Brazil; this makes complete sense, because the prevalence of smart phones and credit cards will help stimulate new ideas. When the next Steve Jobs of Brazil has his or her next brilliant idea, Square will be right there supporting that business every step of the way, and creating long-lasting relationships with people and companies of all sizes across the globe."
3973559,98236,2016-05-10T12:00:10-04:00,Square released its Q1 2016 earnings late last week and the shares fell significantly.Neither the results themselves or the forward guidance were cause for alarm.The company has achieved standout growth and has shown signs of achieving operating leverage as it scales up.Concerns about the ultimate success of the company's lending operation seem particularly misplaced given its unique aspects.The company does have a significant overhang of 64 million shares that will be released from lock-up on 5/16.,"Square Earnings: Trying to make sense out of lots of moving partsSquare (NYSE:SQ) reported the results for its fiscal Q1 on May 5, 2016. There were things to like and things not to like all that much. In the end, Wedbush lowered its ratings on the shares from hold to sell, with a price target about 10% below closing levels on Friday, May 6. Goldman Sachs, however, reiterated its buy rating with a $15 price target which would be 45% above current levels. How much credence readers want to put in the GS recommendation may depend on one's belief in conspiracy theories. No, there are no Illuminati allegedly running the share price but GS led the underwriting for this company a few months ago and the CFO, Sarah Friar, is a well-known former GS software research analyst. Those investors who didn't like the earnings release clearly outweighed those who did. The shares dropped 22% Friday and have dropped 33% since April 28. Over that 10-day stretch, the IGV (Tech-Software Index) was down by 1%. A pretty nasty example of negative alpha, to be sure. Overall, in the wake of the earnings release, there are seven buys, one strong buy, 13 holds and the aforementioned sell. Quite a bit of skepticism.I think a starting point in this discussion is to try to see what the operating results actually portrayed during the quarter and whether or not the operating results, as opposed to other exogenous factors, were really bad enough to account for a 33% drop in share values over the past 10 days.At least on a headline basis, the top line looked reasonably encouraging. The company reports revenue in four significant buckets at this point. Overall revenues rose 52% year on year. Excluding Starbucks transaction revenues, which will go away in the next several months, total net revenues rose by 54% to about $340 million.Square uses another non-GAAP measure for revenue which it calls ""adjusted revenues."" Adjusted revenue"" is calculated by subtracting both Starbucks revenue and transaction costs. Transaction costs grew by 47% year on year, compared to a 42% increase in transaction revenue. Transaction gross margins were 35.4% compared to 37.5% in 2015. The decline in gross margins was driven by the free processing that arose from credits for seller to seller referrals, the promotional processing credits for the company's newer contactless and chip reader hardware, and custom pricing for certain larger sellers. Overall, adjusted revenues, which is the company's preferred way of looking at its growth, grew by 64% in the current quarter, a rate more or less consistent with revenue growth over the past five quarters.The other revenue buckets for this company grew significantly faster than payment processing, although they represent a much smaller amount of reported revenues. Software and data products revenue grew by about 200% year on year and is now $24 million. The primary revenue drivers in that revenue stream are Square Capital, which we will detail more later, and Caviar, which is a restaurant delivery service. The revenue stream also includes traditional software solutions, including a basic payroll app, a basic CRM app and what is called Instant Deposit, which as the name implies provides sellers with an instantaneous credit for customer purchases that Square processes. Those products are relatively new, having been launched less than nine months ago, and their revenues are just starting to be noticeable.Hardware revenue increased from a very small number to $16 million this past quarter, primarily from the ramp of sales of contactless and chip readers.The revenue issue that apparently concerned some analysts and more investors related to the sequential change in the company's Square Capital program which extends loans to the company's credit card processing customers. While Square Capital's outstanding credit balances tripled year over year, they were only up 4% compared to Q4 2015 levels. The issue, management wrote in the earnings release, was the delayed signing of two new investors, which it said was a result of more challenging credit market conditions. The new investors came on board at the end of April and management wrote that new investors have begun to ramp funding.Another issue that some observers, including Jim Cramer, cited was the 4% default rate. In actual fact, as the CFO wrote further on in the earnings release, the default rate was at an all-time low. Initially, most of the loan volume that Square Capital placed was in the form of cash advances. Cash advances are what they are and this is lending to relatively small businesses that historically had high rates of default. Square Capital is in the process of transitioning from providing cash advances to providing its sellers with loans. Many of the company's clients need the flexibility to repay loans early and then start the process over again. Loans work for them better than cash advances. Regardless of all of that, transaction and advance losses were $8 million in Q1 and were a significant improvement compared to $16 million in the year earlier quarter and $13 million last quarter. I think it's pretty straightforward to believe that; as the company transitions Square Capital customers to loans as opposed to cash advances, default rates will drop since loans are secured by the transactions that run through the payment processing of the users in the program. I will comment below on the outlook for revenues of various categories going forward, but I want to focus attention on costs.Total costs that were recorded on the income statement were $207 million. I think it is important to note that these costs reflected a one-time charge that was accrued to settle a lawsuit. The lawsuit alleged that the genesis of SQ's technology was invented by a professor who was subsequently frozen out of company ownership. Absent the impact of the lawsuit settlement, GAAP operating expenses would have been $157 million, which is an increase of 31% year on year, substantially below the 51.6% increase in reported revenues or the 64% increase in ""adjusted"" revenues. On a sequential basis, GAAP operating expenses, excluding the cost of the lawsuit settlement, were flat with those in Q4.Of note, Sales and Marketing expense was flat sequentially and up by 6% year on year. The large expense increases in the quarter were Product Development and G&A expense. G&A expense, absent the charge for the lawsuit settlement, rose to $46 million, an expense ratio of 12%. While 12% is perhaps a bit higher than some companies of this scale might average, it is not too far away from normal levels. G&A expense was flat sequentially and was up by 64% year on year. Much of that increase relates to SQ's status as a public company and one that is in the loan business. This type of increase is a pretty standard phenomenon for most companies that go public. It is one reason that companies are a bit more reluctant to proceed with IPOs. Once the expense is embedded in the G&A expense line, it is not likely that it will trend higher. I imagine that going forward sequentially, G&A expenses will be stable.Of the items in the income statement that was potentially disquieting was the 63% increase in GAAP expense connected with R&D on a year-on-year basis. It troubles me that many companies seem to regard stock-based comp as an expense for which there are no consequences. This company reported the increase in the expense for non-GAAP R&D at 18%, but to me that is a figure without meaning. There are more R&D heads. The heads got paid and it shouldn't matter to management or investors what form the compensation took.The company said that part of the outsize increase in R&D stemmed from the tooling costs associated with the development of the next generation of the company's hardware products. Hardware revenues last quarter were $16 million and GAAP R&D expense rose $25 million year on year. Those new hardware products need to be quite lucrative if the company is going to achieve a significant return on its R&D expense increase.The only good thing that I can say about the R&D spend is that the sequential quarterly increase was $5 million or 8.4%. Overall, the GAAP R&D ratio for the company was 17%, pretty high for a company that gets most of its revenues from processing credit card transactions. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), probably the closest analog company there is to SQ, in its latest reported quarter spent $195 million on R&D, an expense ratio of 7.6%. PayPal reported $2.5 billion in quarterly revenue, 7X greater than SQ's revenue and yet spent just 3X SQ's R&D spend.Spending 17% of revenues on R&D will not, in itself, prevent SQ from reaching profitability. Many companies in the tech space have similar R&D expense ratios. But most tech companies have gross margins that are far greater than 29% which this company reported for Q1.Overall, it would be hard to say that Q1 was not a beat quarter for this company. It was a clear beat on the revenue side. It was a more modest beat on the adjusted EBITDA side. Most of the trends were good. The trend in R&D spending was a disappointment. I think that the overall trend for Square Capital was reasonable and should get significantly better in Q2. The drop in the default rate was noticeable and that drop was significant in increasing adjusted EBITDA.For the full year, the overall adjusted revenue for the year is now expected to be $625 million at the midpoint which is $15 million higher than previous guidance. That would be growth of 38% for the year. The new guidance for adjusted EBITDA is $11 million at the midpoint and that is up from a previous estimate of $9 million. The adjusted EBITDA guidance suggests that the EBITDA margin rate will be in the high single digits at the end of the year. Adjusted EBITDA obviously excludes stock-based comp from the calculation. It would, I think, be helpful for this company to forecast GAAP earnings, but that is not a pervasive practice at this point. That being said, overall adjusted revenues are expected to rise by 38% year on year and GAAP expenses grew by 31% during Q1. So the trends are right. Stock-based comp expense rose to $31 million in the quarter up by 138%. But stock-based comp is 8% of overall revenues, a relatively low figure in the tech world. Stock-based comp was $32 million in the last quarter of 2015 so at least the growth in that metric is slowing significantly.OK - The quarter looks decent on the revenue side, and while margins weren't great, they weren't particularly disappointing either. So what is really the issue with the stock price and overall sentiment?I think that there are several issues. One of those is the role of the CEO Jack Dorsey in trying to run both this company and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). If nothing else, it's just bad optics and the performance of Twitter certainly suggests it needs a full-time CEO. Given all of the issues at both Twitter and SQ, I think investors would prefer to see full-time CEOs at both companies. I believe, to some extent, there's concern that a black swan might creep into the pond, undetected. I obviously have no idea as to what Mr. Dorsey's plans with regard to his role might be going forward, but I do think that until SQ has a full-time CEO, its share value will be less than might otherwise be the case.Of course, in the short term, the biggest issue pressuring the stock is the expiration of the lock-up period for a significant cohort of shareholders. SQ has 335 million shares outstanding as of 3/31. The 180-day lock-up period will end on May 16, and as of that time, 64 million stock options and warrants will be free of sale restrictions. That is a substantial overhang given that SQ's IPO, including overallotments, was for 31 million shares. There's a significant short interest of just less than 15 million shares, but the overhand from the expiration of the lock-up almost certainly looms large in investor perceptions at this point. While I think investors should try to take advantage of the panic over the option overhand, there's no reason to be either a hero or to be in a hurry.But putting aside the lock-up expiration for the moment, the real issues for anyone interested in this company has to do with its market space, its differentiators and its growth prospects. The Wedbush downgrade report says that ""We believe that Square is rapidly growing a business that may never reach either peer (or guided) profitability which will become apparent as growth slows over the next couple of years on competition and pricing."" The Wedbush analyst further wrote that ""Square is selling at Wal-Mart prices with a Neiman Marcus cost structure."" Pretty nasty and somewhat scary.To a certain extent, the crux of the argument relates to whether or not Square is a technology company that gets revenues from processing credit card payments, or if it is primarily a credit card processor with a shiny and cheap card reader and some ancillary services with limited prospects and dubious value. At the end of the day, it is really as simple as that.I'm not going to try to reprise all of the statistics on both sides of the issue - it would lead to a voluminous report that still wouldn't prove much. The fact is that most of Square's initiatives outside of payment processing are nascent and don't represent huge amounts of revenue today.But the company does have, at least for now, a significant leadership role in the use of contactless card readers and it has sold a huge number of those devices. Whether or not the Coachella Music Festival is the best showcase for the technology is a subject for a different discussion. It is easy for me to reach the limits of my enthusiasm for that place. I don't love the desert particularly, I'm dubious about the music... and the food, well least said is best. But it is reasonably true that contactless technology results in a better and far more rapid customer experience. The use of the new cards and readers that allow the cards to be used will be a significant growth driver for a couple of years anyway.The company has recently developed and released open APIs for its payment platform. The significance of that will be that a number of software vendors such as Intuit/QuickBooks are going to build applications on the Square platform. This will serve to both lock in customers and probably lead to additional revenues as well.The company has offerings that it is starting to sell to current users of its payment processing technology that include a very basic form of CRM and a very basic payroll processing application. In addition, the company's Instant Deposit offering, which as the name suggests gives sellers instant access to funds that arise from transactions, is said to be beginning to make a more meaningful contribution to overall software and data product revenue.Can I prove that all of these or even a few of these is going to meaningfully change the playing field for Square? Lacking second sight, of course I can't. Will the aforementioned products help to provide Square with a defensible moat in its payment processing market and extend the period of time in which it can increase the number and size of its sellers? That seems more likely and a bit easier to prove. At the moment, while the attach rates for all of these services is low, it is growing rapidly. The company has a vast market within its current customer base for services that ought to readily appeal to many SMBs.Then there is the lending business potential. Cramer's thesis is that Square could turn into an OnDeck (NYSE:ONDK) or a LendingClub (NYSE:LC). I think it would be tedious to evaluate those companies both of which have had some recent blemishes. But the fact is, Square's lending program is quite a bit different than either of those vendors. It makes loans to its payment processing customers. The loan repayments frequently come from the revenues that it processes for those customers and it has dramatically lower costs than the other lenders because it has no customer acquisition costs - the customers are already doing business with Square. I think investors are concerned that this company might suffer significantly in a recession that would hit its small business customers hard and would certainly squeeze capital markets for small business loans. While I do not think that the hypothesis is necessarily invalid, and in a recession, this company's growth would be significantly impacted and defaults will rise, a recession is going to hobble many business both in and out of tech. If you think there's a recession impending - avoid the tech sector or at least focus on dividend paying names. The unpleasantness of 2008 is still fresh enough in my memory.I'm not going to say much more about the Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) price and Neiman Marcus (NMG) cost structure other than to comment that the cost structure of this company is a product of its view of the market opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, Sarah Friar was a long time and well respected Goldman Sachs analyst. She clearly can calculate costs and margins and other financial metrics with equal facility to the Wedbush analyst. On the last call, she said that the company was in an investment mode. In CFO speak, that means the company will spend money on opex when the opportunity arises to do so on a reasonable basis. No one should invest in this company if they do not have a positive appreciation for the company's non-payment processing initiatives, including lending, software, hardware and Instant Advance.ValuationThis company has 335 million shares outstanding and the market price as I write this is $9.88. So it has a market capitalization of $3.2 billion and its cash balance at the end of the last quarter was $444 million which yields an enterprise value of $2.75 billion. While most analysts are using reported revenue figures to calculate EV/S, I think using adjusted revenues may be a better metric to use. On the traditional GAAP basis, EV/S is 1.8X. Using ""adjusted"" revenues of $625 million in the calculation yields an EV/S of 4.4X. No need to calculate the P/E at this point. Even trying to calculate a ratio based on adjusted EBITDA is not meaningful under the current circumstances.Operating cash flow in Q1 was a negative $15 million and the company had a positive operating cash flow for the full year of 2015. The company doesn't forecast operating cash flow, but it tracks ""adjusted"" EBITDA to a significant extent. My guess is that operating cash flow for the year will be just a small positive number which means that a free cash flow yield would be meaningless.I think this company will have no problem in achieving operating leverage of a significant amount at scale. There's already evidence that it is doing so with regard to S&M expenses, usually a principal problem for early stage hyper-growth businesses. The valuation is totally reasonable if the growth is there. If it isn't - valuation will not be the problem.Summing UpSquare reported its results late last week and the impact on the shares has been noticeably negative. The results were an unequivocal beat on the top line and revenue guidance for the full year was increased. ""Adjusted"" EBITDA for the quarter was a small beat and guidance for the year was increased but just by a bit.Beyond the numbers, investors are clearly worrying about the 64 million share overhang. The company only sold 31 million shares during its IPO so having another 64 million shares potentially added to the supply is more than a bit off-putting to many investors.In addition, many if not most investors are unhappy with the CEO's dual role as trying to run Square and to turn around Twitter simultaneously. It is a reasonable concern, I believe.The other major issue on investor minds appears to be the potential for slow growth in the company's credit platform. Management said that it was unable to secure two new investors until April and hence sequential growth in this business segment. Still a tiny piece of total revenues lagged.The larger question is whether or not this company should be viewed as a payment processing vendor or as a technology leader and disruptor in the payment processing space. The company has several initiatives ongoing that are pregnant with promise, both in terms of revenue in their own right and as the cornerstones of a competitive moat in a very competitive payment processing space.I think it's a reasonable assessment to believe some or most of these initiatives will generate meaningful revenue as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA. I think concerns about the company's loan platform are hugely exaggerated at this point and it appears as well that the credit risks of that program have been substantially overstated.Some analysts believe that the company's costs are out of control. The facts when examined carefully and objectively do not support that assertion. The costs of R&D are a bit elevated but not hugely so. The company's stock based comp expense has grown lately but its growth trajectory at least in Q1 decelerated.At the end of the day, it is all about growth. If the initiatives work - then growth will remain far higher than doubters believe. And the reverse is true. Prescience is a commodity in short supply and I was passed over at birth. But that being said, the valuation is quite modest, even when using ""adjusted"" revenues for a company that may be able to sustain 30% growth for some years while achieving significant operating leverage. The Q1 share price debacle is an opportunity, I believe, and not a harbinger, although I think a bit of patience until the impact of the lock-up expiration abates is probably the prudent strategy."

The company also offers a variety of products to make transactions seamless, allowing instant transfers to seller accounts. Square Analytics helps businesses track their sales and other assorted financial services products worldwide.Recent HighlightsIn March 2016, Square announced the launch of Customer Engagement via a blog post. This tool allows integration with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) so customers can purchase Facebook ads using Square. The business software allows small businesses to target ads and to track them with the aim of teaching business owners how to be more effective with their advertising on the social media platform.Since the IPO opened at $9 per share, Square prices fell at the end of January to a low of $8.06. Since February, however, share prices have risen ~60 percent. As May 10th, shares were trading around $10.(Nasdaq.com)Overview of Management TeamSquare is led by co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, who also is the head of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Mr. Dorsey attended New York University, dropping out in 1999 and dabbling in other fields before heading toward technology. He has a background in programming and first co-founded Twitter in 2006 before co-founding Square in 2009.Competition: Apple Pay, AmazonA number of additional players have entered the mobile payments landscape, including Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon Payments (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet's Android Pay (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). During Square's six-year history, it has primarily had to contend with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) as its main competitor. Now, as more players enter the market, Square also will need to contend with them. Several are positioned well with significant infrastructure in place prior to offering their own mobile payments services.Market PerformanceSquare has experienced a significant upswing in share price since February, as previously noted. At the same time, the consensus of analysts is that the prices are expected to fall by .23 cents per share during 2016 and another two cents per share in 2017. One thing of which investors should note is that Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), a major customer of Square, announced it will be ending its partnership with the payments processor and instead going with a different company. This should be expected to hurt Square's performance for some time. However, the company has a potential market of 30 million small businesses around the world.Conclusion: Short OpportunitySquare has shown strong growth potential as an innovative company. With the potential availability of up to 300 million shares of common stock following the expiration of the company's lockup period on May 17, investors may want to consider selling or shorting the stock before the lockup expiration period for the best advantage."
3966629,99846,2016-04-20T13:02:53-04:00,"The share price of Square has climbed by 60% since February, but we continue to hold for the long-term.We believe it will start to turn a profit next year, ahead of consensus forecasts.This will be achieved through its innovation and a rise in small businesses in the United States.","We have been invested in Square (NYSE:SQ) since it suffered a sharp sell-off during the market turmoil at the end of January. Despite the incredible 60% gain we still believe there could be more to come for shareholders. For this reason, we continue to resist calls to sell and plan on holding on for the foreseeable future.As you can see below, the share price has been on a tear since the start of February. Although it has dropped a touch after being downgraded by BTIG, we still significant gains ahead for anyone investing at this point.The downgrade by BTIG was related to share price reaching what they deemed to be fair value. But they did acknowledge that the company is well-positioned for sustained growth and profitability, which is something we completely agree with.Square is one of those companies that is hard not to love. The technology, software, CEO, and the way it helps small businesses start and flourish is simply brilliant. We are not alone, it does appear that small business owners are in love with Square too.Which is exactly what the company wants. For us, small businesses are the lifeblood of Square. The good news is that technology is making starting a business so much easier than ever, with the costs to start-up much lower now than around 10 years ago. Which could go some way to explaining why there has been a rise in new small businesses.Small business activity increases at lastAfter six years of declines small business activity in the United States picked up at long last last year according to the Kauffman Index. The report shows a small increase in small business ownership to 6 percent, but the density of small business grew to an all-time high of 1,006.6 companies per 100,000 people. This is equal to 3.16 million businesses. The research shows that the main driver of this growth is an increase in micro-enterprises, which employ less than 10 employees. These are exactly the businesses which we feel Square's payment solutions are perfect for.We see this as very encouraging. The percentage of small business ownership has dropped significantly from the 7.6 percent level it was at in 1996. Admittedly, it may be too soon to claim this small increase of a couple of percentage points is a sign we have hit the bottom, but it is definitely a very positive step forward.Square is more than just a payment processorSquare does provide small businesses with so much more than just a payment processor. The recent integration with Facebook ads (NASDAQ:FB) is a great initiative and also a potentially lucrative revenue stream. We feel most owners will want their sales data and ads management in one place, so this is great for them. Additionally, opening up its API to developers is definitely the right move. We feel Square is an incredibly innovative company, but necessity is the mother of invention. Every day there will potentially be little features that users need in order to make their business run that little bit more efficiently. This should allow for that, enhancing the overall experience and hopefully boosting sales which is a win for both the small business and Square.Sourced from Square 10KAs you can see above, we believe that although small businesses with less than $125,000 of sales is still the core business. It is attracting larger businesses to its platform. The table above, which excludes Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), shows that its GPV Mix by seller size has seen a distinct rise in the $500,000+ category. This should be viewed very positively, especially if the trend continues in the current fiscal year.Trusting in Jack DorseyAnother thing that attracts us to Square is its founder and CEO Jack Dorsey. As a well-known and respected entrepreneur himself we feel small business owners are inspired and motivated by what he has achieved. Just last week he visited Australia to visit early adopters of the Square platform. This connection with the company's customers sets it apart from Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL), in our opinion, who also compete in the same space.As a CEO, even with divided responsibilities we feel he has what it takes to take Square to the next level. Which is what investors will be expecting considering it has yet to turn a profit. But we are sure that is coming in the next fiscal year.The company will be in profit soonLike the market consensus, we too are expecting a loss this year. Currently analysts are expecting a loss of 23 cents per share, with a 9 cents per share loss expected when the company announces its first quarter earnings in a couple of weeks. But we differ from the consensus next year. Currently the market sees the company delivering a loss of 3 cents per share, but we think with the help of growth in small businesses the company will burst into profit of at least 10 cents per share.Should the company start making profit earlier than the market expects, we imagine there will be a lot of buying pressure on the shares. This will undoubtedly drive the share price up even higher and through the $20.00 mark. In our opinion it is a good time to be a shareholder of Square, and we hold on regardless of the gains we have made so far.Best of luck with your investments!"

In the wake of what was considered to be a successful quarter with meaningful beats on both the topline and the EPS line, the shares have rallied significantly to new highs. The shares are up 36% since the company reported earnings and while some of that was the result of general market appreciation, the performance indicates investor pleasure with the results and guidance. (Just to be clear, when I write that the actual results for SQ were a significant beat, I do so because the Thomson/First Call numbers are not what analysts are basically tracking for this company when they look at reported earnings.). Although Square is just six-years-old, the company has already had to reinvent itself. What Square is today, with multiple revenue sources and a business model that is hard to classify, is perhaps quite a bit removed from what many readers and investors might imagine the company to be. It is, I believe, worthwhile to take a look at what Square has become in order to determine its potential investment merits.Square likes to measure itself on something it calls ""adjusted revenue"", which is a non-GAAP number that relates to the gross margin the company generates on purchases. Adjusted revenue is an unusual measure by any standard as it is quite a bit lower than the company's nominal revenues. But adjusted revenue growth was just short of 50% last quarter and was actually a bit higher in year-to-year growth than the prior quarter.Square saw 49% growth in revenues measured the traditional way and 64% growth in adjusted revenue for the quarter. Some pieces of total revenue are growing far faster for Square than its payment processing business. What the company calls software and data products grew by 52% sequentially and 272% year to year. The opportunities in software over the longer term are probably significantly greater than the revenues from payment processingSquare is lots of things to different people. Some might describe it as a POS company with some slick and cool hardware and far less complexity and much lower upfront prices. But SQ wants to be a company that offers entry level business analytics in its market space - it is actively engaged in building a small loan business based on its transaction processing customer base, and the company even offers payroll software and other SMB accounting solutions at some very basic level. It is not particularly easy to classify this company and to develop long-term projections by looking at market data and competitive data from third-party researchers.The company's CEO Jack Dorsey is well known and not particularly well liked as the CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). He is an entrepreneur and certainly has not hidden from either the spotlight or from using IPOs to generate lots of net worth. Some readers on this site do not like that but it is not all that different from most Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. There does not appear to be much commonality between what Twitter does and what Square is trying to do. The Sydney Herald described him as ""the American hipster billionaire."" He is actually a reasonably well versed developer as well as an entrepreneur who happens to have covered his body with numerous tattoos. He may have political aspirations to be the mayor of New York, but for now, he seems to have his hands full trying to manage Twitter and Square. While Twitter's share price history has not been admirable (understatement of the day), the company is still growing at 30%/year and is reasonably non-GAAP profitable. I do not think that Jack Dorsey's management is any particular reason to avoid looking at SQ's shares.SQ has a customer count of about 2 million users these days and probably most readers have seen its hardware. Users can buy the hardware from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) directly, and the company has far lower sales and marketing expenses than many other high tech start-ups. It does not employ traditional ""feet on the street"" sales tactics.I will try to describe the various pieces of a typical Square solution below. It is thought by some to be cool and hip. Whether or not that is true, I have to leave to others far better versed in determining coolness and hipness than this writer. Sometimes high-tech companies get carried away with their obeisance to contemporary culture - in one SQ publication I found a comment to the effect that it is now fun to pay for things and to pay friends using Square. Maybe I am old fashioned, but I never like to pay, and regardless of the solution offered, it will never be fun for me. I can say that the setup is small and very cheap to acquire compared to most other POS systems.The company's major business drivers are the transaction volumes that the company processes through its technology. The revenues derived from selling hardware, particularly new technology card readers, the amount of software and data products that it sells and the amount of loan volume that it can generate. A strange animal to say the least.Square's largest current customer is Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM) which uses what is called the Stand (The Stand is really just that - a stand into which users plug iPads that then with Square software becomes a POS terminal) in conjunction with other pieces of Square hardware and its POS application to take in-store payments at venues other than check-out lines. Whole Foods does sell lots of prepared food that many customers eat in cafes that are in the larger stores, including sandwiches, coffee, pizza and in some stores beer and wine. It has been a high visibility win for Square and could potentially pave the way for other, more complex applications for Stand and the company's POS solution.The Square's Stand is perhaps the company's best known device since it is the heart of the company's overall retail solution. Customers use the Stand in conjunction with custom POS kits, magstripe readers and contactless and chip readers to design their own counters. The setup is remarkably inexpensive. You can buy a Square Stand from either Google or Amazon for $99. You can buy a Square Stand bundle for just $169 which includes the Stand itself, coupled with the Square reader and its dock. Depending on the specific application, users can buy cash drawers similar to the ones used in cash registers, bar code scanners and receipt printers. Most users will buy an iPad Air for the system for $399. The company is trying to become a leader in ""embedded chip"" and contactless card readers and, of course, it has options that let customers of its users pay through their phones. There were many reasons, of course, why Whole Foods wants to partner with Square, but total cost of ownership, coupled with extreme ease of use and no training requirements, were significant factors. To a certain extent, Square uses its low-priced hardware as the basis to sell more profitable software and to win processing volumes.Back in 2012, when Square was first marketing its products and services, it made a payment processing deal with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). As with all such deals, Starbucks received very low prices in exchange for providing Square some street cred. In all, Square believes it lost $71 million in processing payments for Starbucks mainly because while Starbucks contributed 11% of Square's revenues, it accounted for 21% of the company's transaction costs. As mentioned below, I have stripped the Starbucks revenue from any quantitative analysis in the balance of this article.Does Square Have Nosebleed Valuation?As these things go, probably not. The company currently has about 335 million shares outstanding. At current prices, that represents a market capitalization of around $5 billion. Valuing a company such as this is simply not an easy exercise. It isn't so much that Square sells things that are unique. POS terminals, business analytics, small business loans and CRM solutions with targeted e-mail have been around for many years. But Square has taken a set of features and solutions that appeal primarily to the SMB market and packaged them together and that really is unique. In most articles that I write, I prefer to refer to industry consultants as supporting my growth estimates. There simply is no way that can be done with Square. Needless to say, neither Gartner or anyone else really has a MQ that defines the scope of the family of Square's solutions.Apparently, the difficulty in defining Square in conventional, easy to analyze terms has attracted lots of short sellers. Almost the entire float of 14 million shares is sold short as of 3/15. The company has almost $500 million of cash and no debt, but that really doesn't matter all that much given the current market capitalization. The enterprise value is $4.5 billion or more than 4X 2015 net revenues of $1.125 billion (excluding Starbucks transaction revenue which is, in essence, a discontinued operation as Starbucks has announced it will soon be using another payment processor). It would be quite a bit higher using the company's favorite metric of adjusted revenue, but as that is not used by most outside observers, I will also not use it for this calculation. But as the company gives guidance in terms of adjusted revenues, that most analysts then translate into net sales, it is important to have some feel for the trend of that metric. The company has forecast that adjusted revenues will be about $600 million-plus this year which is a growth of 33%-34% from 2015 adjusted revenues. The company artfully evaded answering a question on the conference call as to why adjusted revenue growth would be down from the 48% just reported for Q4. Other than the law of large numbers, which seems to be in the future for this company, I really am not sure why the growth rate decline would happen. Square processed $10 billion of payments last year, and although that may sound like a large number, it is trivial in the context of retail sales generated by SMB market participants in this country, let alone internationally. The company's solution is getting lots more traction with larger users who represented more than 39% of its business last quarter, up significantly from 33% in the year earlier quarter. I think simple math would suggest that the company needs to attract larger merchants to its platform simply to be able to achieve reasonable growth in the absence of an expensive field sales force.In any event, of the dozen or so analysts who cover this name, the consensus forecast growth for 2016 is just 23%. I find myself more than a bit baffled as to why that should be given overall company guidance and its likely conservatism, but to the extent the 23% growth actually is what the market is looking for, it presents a favorable setup for investors. This year the consensus analyst estimate for reported revenues is currently $1.56 billion which represents an EV/S of about 3X. Not to make too fine a point here, but self evidently, if the analyst consensus for revenues is too low as appears to be the case for reasons mentioned above, the EV/S calculation would come close to value levels.Needless to say, the company generates losses but not as large as might be imagined. Last year, the operating loss was $174 million and that was up by more than 15% from the prior year. The company does generate lots of reported sales at $1.125 billion last year, up 55% from $$727 million in 2014. (excluding Starbucks transaction revenues of $123 million and $142 million, respectively). There was a bit of operating leverage last year as gross margins increased to 29% from 26.5% and operating expenses declined from 44% of revenues to 43% The company suggested on the conference call that it would be EBITDA positive after Q2 of this year. It said that it is focused on driving significant improvements in SG&A as well as R&D. The company's CFO is Sarah Friar, a well-known analyst at Goldman Sachs in the software sector. She then went to Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) as VP of plans and strategies before joining this company in 2012. She knows exactly what investors expect in terms of metrics for this type of company.The company did achieve a non-GAAP operating cash flow of $28 million last year and that is up from an operating cash loss of $109 million in 2014. Although the cash flow statement has many puts and takes, as many readers might anticipate, a significant part of the improvement was the increase in share-based compensation from $36 million to $82 million. At around 7% of revenues, share based compensation is not really excessive, but it was a significant factor in driving last year's cash flow last year. Although Twitter is known as one of the big sinners with regard to stock-based comp, at least at the moment, and perhaps because of the presence of Sarah Friar, this company has been far more circumspect in its use of non-GAAP compensation measures. While at this point Square is very far from being able to justify its valuation on cash flow, this is not a particularly capital intensive business model. In essence, Square's business model is based on subscription transactions and inherently that is a model that can generate large cash flows over time.Square - typical controversies surrounding valuation and the company's long-term business modelNot terribly surprisingly, I imagine, these shares have been more than a little controversial since the IPO back at the end of November 2015. The shares started trading at $9, a far cry from the expected $9-$13 range. They closed the first day a bit above $13, but descended along with most other tech stocks at the start of the year. They made their low on February, a couple of days before most tech shares found their bottom at $8.37 and have since appreciated by more than 84% to current levels of $15.50.Of the 15 analysts who current cover Square, opinion is pretty evenly split. Eight rate the shares a hold, four rate it the equivalent of buy and three rate it the equivalent of strong buy. Of the last four analysts to initiate on the name, two ranked it a hold and another two ranked it as buy or equivalent. Interestingly, the mean price target is just $14/share and the high price target is $16. Obviously, the share price performance has outstripped the expectations of most analysts in the past couple of months.More than is usually the case, analyst estimates are more or less worthless at this point - really. Analysts have the company reducing its loss per share by 80% this year and growing at 23%. I think that if the company actually had only 23% after growing 55% last year, the shares would collapse and rightfully so. And I think it is also likely that if the company grew by 23%, it would never be able to decrease its non-GAAP net loss per share by 80%. The mean sales growth is projected by analysts is $300 million from the level reported this year or a bit more excluding revenues from Starbucks. But regardless of that, to eliminate 80% of the total losses would require operating expenses to show no increase and perhaps decline. Not a particularly likely scenario. I think a better set of expectations would be for revenue growth to be in the low 30% range or $370 million. That growth would generate about $39 million in additional gross margin. If opex were to grow by say 18%, that would probably wipe out the operating loss for 2016 as a whole. There is significant seasonality for a company like this - its revenues are based on mainly on the sales of its own customers which are far higher in Q4s and lower in Q1s. So, some time by the middle of this year, the company should start to generate non-GAAP earnings.At this point, it might be nice if I could just take some growth rate and market share estimates from a selection of third-party consultants and try to write how much it was all worth. No luck in doing that here.Selling credit card terminals, even sexy looking credit card terminals, is not considered to be one of the high growth opportunities of all time. No doubt, the SMB community and the mobile community has been underserved with regard to payment devices. Square has a first mover advantage in the space. But I don't imagine anyone thinks that the secular growth in that business is 50% or more for any significant duration. While I'm never really going to call the kind of growth that Square has been enjoying as shabby, what the company calls adjusted revenue which is really the gross profit it earns on payments through its platform has actually slowed down a bit and most analysts have percentage growth declining further over the next two years. If all Square did was to simply generate payment processing fees from its customers, its growth really might slow down to 20% rather quickly and that would really not make for a very interesting stock to most readers.But the company, just to make things a bit more complex than they already are, says that in order to make estimates for transaction volumes on its platform, one must use an analysis by cohort by which it means that volumes from existing users rise the longer the Square solutions are installed. There simply aren't the tools available to do a cohort analysis, but it is clearly adding significantly to growth. So, perhaps the reasonable estimate for adjusted revenue growth ought to be higher than 20%, although how much higher is really impossible to determine at this point.Square's own market research suggests that 20 million out of 30 million US businesses do not currently accept credit cards. The Square solution is far cheaper and probably more effective in solving that problem than anything else that is on the market today. Whether that really means it can sell its solution to 20 million businesses and whether those 20 million businesses will generate sufficient payment processing fees to facilitate the company's growth are probably unknowable at this point. I think that a reasonably prudent model for estimating the growth in transaction revenues for the next several years might be 25%.OK, so can Square's shares be justified as a long-term investment outside of the transaction revenue segment?I actually think they can. There are several major potential growth sources for this company which are probably not well modeled by anyone at this point. The first of these is the company's line called software and data products. Software at Square includes Square Payroll which is basically designed to be a functional, but limited payroll package that can be used to pay employees and calculate withholding taxes. It is geared to enterprises that pay by the hour but it can be used for salaried staff as well. It is no doubt a very basic payroll product, but then again, given the target market and the fact that it is essentially part of the payments system inherent in Square, it probably has a significant market potential. Square also sells a CRM/e-mail marketing system to its users. Many people these days think of e-mail marketing as extinct as the dodo. But Square's customer set, concentrated as it is in the SMB space, is happy to have any affordable tool to enhance their ability to use targeted marketing. Square Cash allows person to person money transfer in a fashion similar to that of PayPal and it recently facilitated the service for business to business payments. Square acquired a company called Caviar in the summer of 2014. Caviar essentially replaced Square Order which was shut down. It is a high-end restaurant delivery service for popular restaurants who otherwise could not offer delivery on an economic basis.Probably the most important software product that Square currently offers is its POS system. I do not propose to bore readers by attempting to evaluate the feature/function set of the Square solution and compare it specifically to market leaders. Square really doesn't sell that way. Its customers are acquired through the web and they are looking for cost effective, easy to use systems and can give up lots of functionality for that kind of product. Square POS does come with typical POS functionality including payments, digital receipts, open tickets inventory reports. It runs on both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Android devices. Again, Square POS features are probably somewhat limited compared to some of the more powerful systems out there but since it essentially uses other Square hardware the total cost to users is going to be very low. Absolutely no training is necessary - I know that since it is how I pay for my morning coffee. Current software allows for open tickets and split tender and it has an inventory management feature as well. It even does payables.I imagine that the furthest afield that Square gets from what most investors think about in evaluating the company is Square Capital. Square Capital is perhaps unique in the SMB financing world. The company basically offers loans to its users that are based on the volume of transactions that Square is processing. The loans are often secured by the amount of revenues generated by a typical borrower. These are really tiny loans that could never be profitably made in any traditional fashion. The company made 70,000 advances and loaned $400 million in 2015 which works out to an average cash advance of less than $6,000. The business seems to be growing rapidly as Square advanced more than $150 million in Q4, a run rate in excess of $600 million. At this point, the company does not disclose the spread it makes on the loans so it is basically impossible to determine profitability of the unit. Square funds some of the loans through its own cash balances. In addition, it has third-party investors who sometimes fund loans. Again, at some point, Square is going to have disclose spreads and origination costs and all the normal metrics that are expected of a financial services vendor but that hasn't happened just yet.It is hardly surprising that the service has been well received by users who doubtless are always capital starved and find using Square a much easier process than trying to secure a credit line from a traditional financial outlet. If anyone thinks that this writer has a crystal ball to determine just how large Square Capital can be, think again. Seriously, other than using the credit line on your credit card where can a small business go to get a line secured only by their sales or even nothing more than an assignment of future sale revenues? How large can Square Capital get and how profitable can it be? Without some projections from the company all I can do is guess. I just do not know of a comparable service that is readily available to users at a reasonable cost.An adjunct service that Square offers is called Instant Deposit. One of Square's major selling points is that it turns around invoices far more rapidly than traditional credit card processors. It will almost invariably make funds available to its customers the next day and it doesn't impose holds on larger transactions that are standard for typical ""Merchant Acquirers."" But some users need their money even more quickly and Square will send funds from a sale immediately to a seller's bank account 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. The seller pays an additional 1% fee for the service in order to get his money a day early. That is a better interest rate than my bank pays these days. The service was launched in August 2015 and by the end of the year 58,000 sellers had completed more than 600,000 transactions, instantly.Square's POS, Financial and Marketing Service revenues appear very small but they really offer explosive growth and data products look to be a very small percentage of revenue. They were 5% of total reported revenue less Starbucks this year compared to 1.6% last year. Last quarter software revenues reached 6.9% of the total excluding Starbucks, compared to 4.9% in the prior quarter. Software revenues grew by almost 5X last year and increased by no less than 52% sequentially. Square looks at adjusted revenues in tracking its software business. Software revenues tracked that way have gone from 1% of revenues at the start of 2014 to 17% of revenues last quarter. Regardless of how one defines percentages, the kind of growth that the company is achieving on the software line is really quite explosive and has the potential to significantly alter the business model over time. Needless to say, software revenues have far greater gross margins than transaction revenues. Transaction costs had what I describe as gross margins of 36% last year while software revenues had gross margins of a bit over 61%.So, I think another key question in trying to arrive at some realistic valuation for this company is the size of the target market for its software and data products. And therein lies a significant problem for many analysts and writers like myself. The Square solution does have some significant differences that go far beyond its ability to deliver a sexy looking POS system for very little money. Even Square's distribution model which is based on retail/self-service distribution is significantly different than how most other POS terminals are sold. The pricing for Square's services is easy to understand for customers, the approval process to become a Square customer takes minutes and is far less cumbersome than the approval process of traditional merchant acquirers. But probably of greatest interest to the company's customers is that settlement of charges is either next day or instant and there are no holds for larger transactions.There is no really reliable way to assess Square's potential growth rate. High - surely. Above 30% - seems likely. How much above 30% - really hard to imagine. I really haven't a clue about how anyone might go about creating a TAM estimate for all of things that this company does which is the only way I have ever seen the third-party consultants make their estimates. If you are going to invest in this company, and I certainly think that it has a more than decent risk/reward profile, you are going to have to do so without real long-term growth projections which are more or less unknowable at this point.Why no analysts like to make projections about the future - mainly because it hasn't happened yet!President Lincoln in an interview with two Wisconsin newspaper editors given in August 1864 was asked about the possibility of returning the freed African-Americans to bondage in exchange for the southern states rejoining the Union. He said to the editors that if he were to do so ""I would be damned in time and in eternity for so doing."" Nothing as seminal as that here, but the fact is that anyone trying to make a projection regarding some potential growth rate scenarios ought to realize that they too will be damned in time... if they try to be too precise. Forecasting the growth of disruptive technologies at a level of precision necessary to try to make detailed financial projections is simply not possible. I think, but I don't know, that the growth in transaction volumes over the Square platform is likely to be around or over 25% for some years to come. I think but I know with even less conviction that the growth in the company's software and data product offering might be well over 30% for some years to come. Just to look at one of the few analogs available. Constant Contact, probably the leading e-mail advertising company for the SMB space and which was recently acquired by Endurance International, was able to reach 650k customers after 15 years of extreme effort. Square, as of this writing, has more than 2 million users who are paying it regularly. Almost certainly these customers can use some form of targeted marketing. It is really lots easier to acquire targeted e-mail customers from a cohort that is paying for a processing service every month than it is to spend enormous sums on radio and TV ads, hire a significant cohort of salespeople and run all kinds of social media promotions. In its last year as a public company, CTCT had revenues of a bit greater than $300 million with decent margins. Again, the details about how the Square e-mail marketing service is to be run haven't been provided, but one can speculate that it might build up to a $50 million stream of revenues with high profitability over time. For the full year 2015, Square's software business was $58 million. I think that it is eminently reasonable to believe that Square's software component outside of its financial services group can grow at 30%-plus for several years to come.I simply have nothing substantive on which to base any projection with regards to the company's financing operations. It would seem to me that the company has many built-in advantages in attempting to develop a significant loan portfolio within its customer base. It appears to have pricing advantages and other advantages as well that go through borrower acquisition cost, security and speed of approval. We really do not know what the company earned in gross spreads on the $400 million that it advanced or even if there were any significant charge-offs. But for a company that is processing something more than $10 billion of payments across its network, I have to think that there is significant growth available in the sector. Just to take a couple of final examples.Caviar, the company's restaurant delivery service (this company sells its basic POS/payment service to numerous restaurants so it has been relatively easy to get its existing customers to sign up for a delivery service) grew by 4.5X year over year. And the company's hardware revenues, which these days comes primarily from the company's contactless and chip reader, grew to a Q4 run rate of $25 million/year, up by 215% from prior year revenues.There are some signs that the company's scale is already enabling some operating leverage. The company's S&M spend was up 25% last year, significantly below the growth in adjusted and net revenues. The company had high G&A spending in Q4 as a consequence of its public offering. It seems reasonable to anticipate that G&A spend will flatten out substantially during the course of the current year.Some Final thoughtsPutting together a cogent thesis regarding the outlook for Square is far tougher than might be expected. It isn't really just about mobile payment processing for small and mid-sized businesses. The company has acquired and continues to acquire some rather substantial customers, most notably Whole Foods, and it has driven the percentage of revenue coming from customers who process more than $125k/month in total sales to 39%, up from 33% at the start of 2015, which should be a margin driver going forward. While the percentage growth in processing revenues will probably moderate over time, the company has huge market opportunities both in the US and abroad to capture the 20 million establishments that do not currently take cards.But beyond the company processing business lie the opportunities for the company in the POS space with a far lower cost solution than anything else available. The company has begun to offer a payroll service to its customers and it now offers some kind of CRM/targeted e-mail capability as well. These are all substantial markets that have never been accessible to most software vendors because the cost of distribution is far too high as a percentage of potential revenue. The Square model potentially solves those problems since what they will be selling are add-ons to the company's installed base.Probably the company's single greatest marketing opportunity will be the loan generation of its capital operation. Again, the company has millions of small retailers who do not have ready access to capital except through their personal credit cards. Square Capital is relatively cheap, the approval process is far easier than it is for personal lines of credit other than those secured by home equity lines and at $6,000/average loan Square is able to access capital demands that cannot be meant elsewhere on an economic basis.This is, to be sure, a SaaS business in that the processing revenues will most likely go on almost forever. But unlike many other SaaS businesses, the company has a comparatively quick payback when it sells new customers since marketing expense is not nearly as high as is the marketing expense of a SaaS software vendor who has to pay substantial sales commissions and actually has some costs in building out a network with appropriate redundancy.This company has loads of growth opportunities and some of them are almost certainly going to fail or blow up along the way. I think the biggest risk this company has is trying to manage a large portfolio of so many potential opportunities with a CEO who is engaged 50% in trying to deal with another company, Twitter, that seemingly has material problems. It is reasonable to believe that the CFO is most likely responsible for a significant percentage of this company's innovations and he will, perhaps, need to revisit his dual role at some point in the near future.Overall, however, I think it isn't off the wall to project that this company might deliver revenues of greater than $4 billion by 2020 with operating margins above 20% non-GAAP. It is certainly credible to me that the company could earn well above $2/share by that time.Forecasts for a company doing so many things in so many markets where nothing at the price point that Square charges has ever existed is extremely hard to forecast. It is not a matter of taking a standard degradation curve and superimposing it on some estimates of TAM. There is no TAM to be seen here because there is no easily defined space. But at the end of the day, that is really a good thing - this company is trying to disrupt lots of spaces and if they were easy to define then they could not easily be disrupted.What's it worth? My guess is that it will be worth far more than current quotations."

The SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) agreement follows a 2014 deal with IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) through which Big Blue has been reselling iOS hardware and has developed iOS apps for various industries, and a 2015 deal with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to create a ""fast lane"" for iPhones/iPads on networks using Cisco gear and enable a ""seamless experience"" between iPhones and desk phones in Cisco environments. Apple has also been courting various independent enterprise developers.SAP and Apple will work to enable apps that can leverage the high-speed Hana in-memory database (popular with both many enterprises and independent developers) through SAP's Hana Cloud Platform, as well as access features from core SAP apps running on Hana. Much like IBM, SAP will also be developing iOS apps ""for critical business operations.""EMC/VMware's Pivotal unit raises $253M at a $2.8B valuation - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Ford (NYSE:F), and General Electric (NYSE:GE) took part in the funding round, as did EMC (EMC) and VMware (NYSE:VMW), each of which already had large stakes. Though Pivotal provides a variety of app development and big data/analytics tools and services, Microsoft, Ford, and GE's interest appears to revolve around the Pivotal Cloud Foundry app development (""PaaS"") platform. Microsoft says it wants its Azure cloud platform to be ""the best place to run Java applications using Pivotal Cloud Foundry."" GE notes that Pivotal Cloud Foundry acts as ""the foundation"" for its Predix IoT cloud service platform.EMC has discussed Pivotal IPO plans as far back as 2013, and Re/code reported of a potential early-2016 IPO last November. But with Pivotal still producing a lot of red ink - the company had a Q1 operating loss of $58M on revenue of $83M (+56% Y/Y) - EMC appears to be in no rush to take its spin-off public.Windows 10 active users top 300M; Microsoft shows off mobile ""hover gestures"" - Microsoft's latest Windows 10 user figure is up from 270M in late March and 200M in early January. In terms of adoption by the Windows installed base, Windows 10 (provided as a free upgrade to Windows 7 and 8 users until July 29) seems to be living up to the company's expectations - over 15% of all PCs now run Windows 10, according to NetMarketShare. Unfortunately, free Windows 10 upgrades might also be adding to the PC industry's recent sales woes as consumers/businesses decide they can upgrade their user experience without upgrading their hardware.Microsoft also disclosed over 63B minutes were spent using the Edge browser in March, and that Cortana (baked into Windows 10) has answered over 6B questions. The data obtained from those queries could help make Cortana more competitive with Google Now (baked into Google (GOOG, GOOGL)) Android and Siri (baked into iOS).In other news, Microsoft has shown off Kinect-like gesture technology that allows a phone user to (with the help of sensors) manipulate a screen without touching it. The Verge notes it isn't clear if the solution will be brought to market, given the current state of Microsoft's phone efforts. Licensing it to Apple and Android OEMs could be an option.eBay buys AI startup ExpertMaker - ExpertMaker, which has already been working with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for several years, declares its machine learning solutions ""continuously learn from [a company's] data"" to predict actions and personalize content. eBay, whose shopping/product browsing experience still receives its share of criticism, says ExpertMaker will help it ""build a best-in-class product catalog."" VentureBeat notes ExpertMaker could help eBay deliver better search and recommendation algorithms - much of the start-up's work has involved creating intelligent, subject-specific search engines.The acquisition is another example of how investments in machine learning - a part of AI that involves using algorithms that get better at understanding patterns as more data is analyzed - aren't just for the likes of Google and IBM. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and LinkedIn (LNKD) have also bought start-ups developing machine learning-based services.Alibaba gains after posting mixed results, reporting 41% Chinese marketplace growth; Yahoo also rises - Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) FQ4 (calendar Q1) sales easily beat estimates, as revenue growth improved to 39% from FQ3's 32%. EPS missed, thanks largely to big investments in non-core businesses such as video content/services and the Koubei local services JV with Alipay parent Ant Financial. Koubei, by itself, had a $118M impact on Alibaba's FQ4 bottom line.Driving the sales beat: Chinese marketplace (Taobao/Tmall) revenue rose 41% Y/Y, better than FQ3's 35%. At 24%, marketplace GMV growth was only a little better than FQ3's 23% (rivals such as JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) are growing faster), but Alibaba's GMV monetization rate improved to 2.47% from 2.17% a year ago, with the mobile monetization rate now up to 2.42%. Also: Alibaba's cloud computing/web infrastructure revenue rose 175% to $165M, with the AliCloud infrastructure platform (big in China) now claiming 2.3M users and 500K+ paid customers.Improving mobile monetization has boosted Alibaba's revenue. Source: Earnings slides.As of Thursday's close, Yahoo's (YHOO) M&A drama-filled 384M-share Alibaba stake was officially worth $30.3B. Yahoo's market cap stood at just $35B. There could be a good payoff for shareholders if the company finds a way to tax-efficiently monetize its Alibaba stake.3D Systems slumps after missing sales estimates; gross margin improvement lifts EPS - In March, beaten-down 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) flew higher after delivering a large Q4 beat. No such luck after the Q1 report, as a revenue miss and a related 9% Y/Y drop in product sales sparked a 6.4% drop on Thursday. 3D printing rival Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) fell 2.7%.As was the case with the Q4 report, 3D, which recently hired former HP printing chief Vyomesh Joshi to be its CEO, didn't provide formal guidance. Like peers, the company has been stung by overcapacity at industrial/prototyping 3D printer clients, even as end-user 3D printing adoption continues growing. On the earnings call, the company mentioned professional printer sales fell 23% and parts manufacturing services revenue fell 15%. Software (sales +22%), production printers (+18%) and healthcare (+12%) were bright spots. A higher gross margin boosted EPS, as did a moderate decline in operating expenses.GoPro drops after mixed results and guidance affirmation; Ambarella ticks higher - The fact that Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), a video processor developer that gets a large portion of its revenue from GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), rose slightly after-hours even as GoPro fell is telling here. It's not GoPro's sales that are bothering the market at current depressed levels - Q1 revenue beat estimates, 2016 sales guidance was affirmed, and GoPro noted (though camera shipments fell 48% to 701K due to inventory clearing) end-user camera sales were nearly flat Y/Y.Rather, it's the EPS pressure stemming from large gross margin declines (caused by both shipment declines and price cuts) and still-aggressive spending (operating expenses rose 37% Y/Y in spite of job cuts) that are troubling the Street. Also: GoPro has delayed the launch of its Karma drone (once due in 1H16) to the holiday season. That's also when the Hero5 camera line (GoPro's first big refresh since the 2014 holiday season) is due. Q4 will matter even more than usual this year.Square tumbles after beating on revenue, missing on EPS, and hiking 2016 guidance - The profitability concerns that have dogged Square (NYSE:SQ) since pre-IPO times weren't exactly dispelled by the Q1 report. Even if one backs out a $50M litigation accrual, the company saw its operating loss rise slightly Y/Y to $47.1M in spite of 51% revenue growth on the back of 45% payment volume growth. In addition, the gross margin for Square's core payment processing business fell slightly to 35.3%.But there are some reasons to think the margins will begin improving: Operating expense growth (18% on a non-GAAP basis) is slowing, Square's Starbucks business (for which gross margin is close to nothing) will soon end, margin pressure caused by the launch of Square's new card reader (sold at a loss) will diminish, and higher-margin software and data product revenue (fueled by the Square Capital cash advance business and Caviar food delivery service) grew 197% and made up 13% of gross profit.2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance was slightly hiked in spite of the Q1 EPS miss. A 64M-share lockup expiration arrives on May 16.Tableau sells off after reporting beating estimates, reporting major license growth slowdown, and hiking full-year guidance - With shares having been crushed in February following Tableau's (NYSE:DATA) Q4 report, they fell a relatively modest 5.5% after-hours on Thursday after the company reported software license growth (drives future service growth and acts as a proxy for the growth of a company's paid installed base) of 14% Y/Y in Q1, compared with 31% in Q4 and 57% a year ago. Also, $100K+ deals rose by just 8% to 268.Fears about tough competition from a slew of business intelligence/analytics software rivals - Microsoft's Power BI platform (now part of a Cortana Analytics Suite) is mentioned most often, but Qlik (NASDAQ:QLIK) Sense, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) QuickSight, and other offerings also get attention - are bound to persist. As are worries about sales execution - Tableau announced in January long-time sales chief Kelly Wright is retiring, and the company now says it's looking to hire a president to head its go-to-market activities by year's end.Nonetheless, the fact that 2016 sales guidance was slightly hiked suggests Tableau expects some improvement in license growth later this year. EPS guidance, meanwhile, was hiked significantly due to the company cutting its 2016 hiring plans in half. Though Tableau's competitive environment looks tougher than it did 12-18 months ago, its offerings are still often seen as best-in-class in a next-gen BI/analytics space growing quickly as companies look to give office workers something better than Microsoft Excel for deriving insights from business data.Gartner places Tableau in its ""Leaders"" quadrant for the BI/analytics market. But plenty of competition exists.Yelp jumps after mixed Q1 results, solid Q2/2016 guidance - Like Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Yelp (NYSE:YELP) dominates an online niche, but has been hurt by concerns about slowing growth, heavy spending/margin pressure, and growing competition. Also, like Zillow and Etsy (both surged post-earnings earlier this week), Yelp's Q1 report could reduce those concerns a bit, even if it won't eliminate them.Local ad revenue rose 40% Y/Y, an improvement from Q4's 35%. Cumulative reviews rose 31% to 102M, local ad accounts rose 34% to 121K, and ""app unique devices"" accessing Yelp rose 32% to 21M/month. In addition, Yelp reports app users were more than 10x as engaged as website users, many of whom come via Google.On the other hand, GAAP sales/marketing spend rose 51% to $95.6M and equaled 60% of revenue - that's a big reason Yelp missed EPS estimates in spite of a revenue beat. Compared with selling ads to Global 2000 companies (as Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) often do), selling ads to local businesses typically brings a much lower return per dollar of sales/marketing spend. That was a challenge for Yelp when it went public in 2012, and is still a challenge today. But with the stock trading more than 75% below its 2014 highs, the market appears willing to focus on the Q1 report's positives.Activision gains on Q1 beat and strong Q2 guidance - Full-year guidance is nearly in line. A 41% Y/Y increase in console revenue to $328M (lifted by Call of Duty: Black Ops III) more than offset a 10% drop in PC revenue to $301M. Candy Crush Saga developer King Digital (BATS:KING) contributed $207M following the February closing of Activision's (NASDAQ:ATVI) purchase of the company.Some positive metrics were also reported: Activision and Blizzard brands' online monthly active users (""MAUs"") respectively rose 10% and 23% Y/Y to 55M and 26M, and King's MAUs rose 3% Q/Q to 463M. Without giving a number, Activision states King's gross bookings rose Y/Y. 88% of total revenue came from ""digital online channels.""FireEye falls after posting mixed results, issuing soft sales guidance, and announcing a CEO change - A cybersecurity darling not too long ago, FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) has been battered over the last 12 months due to concerns about both sales execution and intensifying competition from the likes of Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Cisco, each of which have been bundling cheaper malware-protection offerings with other security products. FireEye's product (hardware/software) revenue dropped 16% Y/Y in Q1 to $33.7M. Subscription/service revenue, lifted by both organic growth and M&A, rose 58% to $134.3M.Some positives: Q1 billings of $186M (+23% Y/Y) surpassed guidance of $163M-183M, and full-year billings, EPS, and cash flow guidance has been reiterated (but not revenue guidance). On the earnings call, FireEye said its Q1 billings growth was driven by ""cloud-based solutions and especially our threat intelligence and cloud email and our FireEye as a Service capability.""That might provide some context for FireEye's CEO change and broader management shakeup. While its traditional threat-prevention hardware/software business is clearly under pressure, many of the endpoint protection and incident response offerings obtained through FireEye's $1B+ December 2013 acquisition of Mandiant remain strong points for the company. Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia is now FireEye's CEO, and Mandiant president Travis Reese has been named FireEye's president.Arista rises on Q1 beat and strong Q2 guidance - With the help of strong demand from major cloud service providers, Arista's (NYSE:ANET) high-density, low-latency switches continue taking data center switch share. Product revenue rose 33% to $212.5M, and subscription service revenue 57% to $29.7M.On its earnings call, Arista made plenty of references to strong demand from ""cloud titans,"" while also insisting demand from other service providers, tech firms (deploying for internal use), and financial firms was solid. Major customer Facebook recently forecast its 2016 capex will be at the high end of a prior $4B-4.5B guidance range.LinkedIn reportedly working on publishing feature similar to Facebook's Instant Articles - Like Instant Articles, LinkedIn's reported feature would let users read full articles from partners within its own apps, rather than having to go to a publisher site. Publishers would benefit from giving readers a better experience, while LinkedIn would get to keep users on its apps and perhaps use its professional data to deliver targeted ads against the articles.One challenge for LinkedIn: Compared with Facebook, far fewer of the company's users rely on it to consume content, and (for this reason and others) the company's advertising scale is much less than Facebook's. Facebook has convinced many publishers to embrace Instant Articles (in spite of the loss of control it brings) because of its reach and monetization ability. LinkedIn could face a tougher sell.Amazon leases 20 more Boeing 767s - Two months after striking a deal with Air Transport Services to lease 20 Boeing 767s for a U.S. air cargo network, Amazon has inked a deal to lease another 20 from Atlas Air Worldwide. Both deals have included granting Amazon warrants that allow it to obtain substantial minority stakes in the company it's leasing from.Amazon's transportation logistics efforts, of course, go well beyond air freight. Morgan Stanley sums it up: ""AMZN's continued initiatives in the space (which includes purchasing thousands of truck trailers, applying for an ocean freight forwarding license, registering with the SEC as a transportation company together with setting up its own last-mile delivery service in select cities) indicate its seriousness in building out at least the early stages of an end-to-end delivery network… we believe UPS/FDX need to at least keep one eye on the rear view mirror."""
3961850,101421,2016-03-30T01:14:38-04:00,"Square posted good growth metrics in its first report as a public company.The company is aggressively building out diversified offerings to small merchants.This build-out will take time, but presents a buying opportunity for the patient investor.","SummarySquare (NYSE:SQ) is a good medium-term bet due to a growing pipeline of value-added services to merchants, Square Capital, Customer Engagement, international expansion and nascent social network-like aspects. In the short term, the company will struggle to generate meaningful earnings due to scaling and expansion costs.Earnings ReleaseSquare recently released its first financial report (10K) as a public company. While the report showed significant top-line growth, many analysts seemed to be underwhelmed by the results. Others wondered where Square's competitive advantage lies in a world of hyper-competitive payment processor giants such as Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and others.What is Square Building?Although the company is known as a ""payment processor"" by virtue of its basic merchant service, Square is becoming much more than that:1. Analytics ProviderThe company offers its merchants analytics capabilities to help them understand their operations and customers better.This value-added service not only helps retailers become more successful, it creates a stronger relationship between Square and its merchant customers.But the value to Square is even greater: it knows in real-time what its merchants are selling and collecting in revenues, among countless other data insights.2. Square CapitalAs a result of its real-time knowledge of merchant financials, Square launched in 2014 the ability to provide short-term merchant cash advances through connecting third-party funders with merchants.By the end of 2015, Square Capital was facilitating or providing capital to merchants at an annual run rate of $600 million.Furthermore, the company says that the majority of capital is provided by third parties, so Square has minimal balance sheet exposure to potential credit losses, which it says are currently running in the low-single digits.These merchant cash advances average $6,000 per merchant, with a typical payback period of 8-9 months, per the company's annual report.Square's management says that it is considering expanding into merchant loans, presumably with longer terms and larger dollar amounts, effectively becoming an online lender to small businesses.3. Customer EngagementSquare recently launched a new service called Customer Engagement. This suite of CRM tools enables merchants to easily add customers to this suite to better ""understand and engage"" with their customers on an ongoing basis.Also recently, a major partnership Square announced for the Customer Engagement suite was with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Square merchants can now use the suite to initiate Facebook ads in order to obtain more customers as well as stay in front of existing customers.Square gets a piece of the ad spend from this partnership while continuing to provide more value-added services to its merchants through a single platform.Company management says this is only the first step in this direction. Also mentioned were other potential future service additions, such as payroll.4. International ExpansionThe company currently has operations in ""most countries worldwide"" and says it continues to expand its reach into more countries in order to broaden its user base.For example, it recently launched an office and service in Australia. Its headquarters is in San Francisco, but it also has offices in Canada and Japan.What seems clear is its growing focus on the Pacific Rim region given the location of its ex-USA offices. However, the company is wary of committing heavily to locations where the protection of its intellectual property is difficult, such as China.For the year ended 2015, International revenue totaled only $42.5 million, or 2.5% of gross revenue. There is clearly much more room to grow, especially in countries such as India which have large English-speaking populations and a large small-merchant population segment.5. Developer API SuiteSquare recently announced a suite of APIs that will provide developer access to its merchant platform. The APIs include the ability to process online purchases, integrate with any payment using the Apple iOS system and various inventory management, sales reporting and employment management functions. The new capability is seen as a direct competitor to Stripe and Braintree, which provide payment processing, but for online-only businesses.ConclusionsSquare is creating a company that is much more than a payments processor. While the payments piece is certainly important, it really is the ""on-ramp"" to enabling a full-service business relationship with small merchants.The company is aggressively developing an integrated set of solutions to under its Customer Engagement banner designed to help merchants adopt digital technologies to grow their business.Square is also creating the building blocks for what I term a ""Merchant Social Network."" By understanding the concerns of its quickly growing user base of small merchants and creating a unified platform for addressing their various pain points, it's easy to envision the addition of an online network for its merchants. I believe Square will prioritize user growth to fuel this de-facto network.This internal social network would enable merchants to develop new supply chains, learn from each other and improve the efficiency of their operations. The company could create partnerships with a variety of companies to further enhance the value of this network: training & education, product & service sourcing and logistics, to name a few.It is also conceivable that Square might under certain circumstances lower the payment processing fees it charges in order to maintain merchant lock-in, while more than making up the difference on a broad range of value-added services.Whatever the scenario, Square is building a suite of service offerings that are much more than just a simple ""payment processor."" It is building a small merchant operations platform.This build-out will take time, so the stock will likely not have much catalyst for appreciation in the short term as earnings are used for scaling and expansion.But for the medium term, I'm enthusiastic about the possibilities that Square has hinted at in its continued product expansion so far as a young public company."
3937316,98036,2016-02-27T14:54:28-05:00,"At the moment, I don't see any opportunities in Square and won't recommend its stock.Lack of communication between the executive branch is the main reason why the company is underperforming.This results in poor financial performance inside the company and doesn't create any shareholder value.","Since its IPO in late 2015, Square (NYSE:SQ) shares have quickly depreciated in value. Management fails to provide its shareholders with a reasonable explanation of how it will improve the situation and when the profits will pour in. Also, a lack of communication between the executive branch is causing even more trouble for which Square's investors pay. Until the top management is replaced, I don't see any opportunities in Square and won't recommend its stock. Here are the main reasons behind my thinking:Red Flag #1Currently Square has an operating margin of -13.96% and a net-margin of -14.66%. It makes a substantial amount of revenue, but fails to produce profits. Its overall financials are not in a good shape:Source: gurufocus.comEven before its IPO roadshow the company disclosed its quarterly loss and said sales growth is slowing. For me this is the first red flag that says not to invest in Square. Also, before going public, its second largest shareholder Vinod Khlosa of Khlosa Ventures, with a 17.3% stake at the company, decided to leave the board of directors. This sort of thing damages your reputation and is not a good sign for investors, especially if you want to raise more money.Red Flag #2In my opinion, bad performance is caused, in part, by a lack of communication between the executives at the company, especially when it comes to the CEO. Square's founder, CEO and biggest shareholder is Jack Dorsey, who at the same time also serves as a CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which is also not doing so well.I believe running two public companies at the same time causes a lack of focus and puts impossible stress on the person trying to do it. Don't believe me? Take Steve Jobs for example. In his book, Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography, Walter Isaacson writes about when Jobs was running Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Pixar at the same time. Steve described this experience as ""the worst time in my life.""Consider Elon Musk. While he runs Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX at the same time, he stated that eventually he'll take a step back from the day-to-day running of Tesla. In an interview with Ashlee Vance (via Mashable), he described the experience of simultaneously running two companies:The lack of full-time attention from the CEO is a major reason why Square is in such poor financial shape. For me, this is the second red flag that says not to invest in Square.Red Flag #3Last October Financial Times ran a story (link goes to FT subscription page) about Dorsey's role in Square and its plans to go public. The newspaper, according to its sources, says the main reason to file for an IPO was the lack of financing from VC's. As one venture capitalist said:With the lack of financing, Square will have a serious problem in the future. Eventually the company won't have enough resources to fight its competition and acquire more users into its ecosystem. And while the IPO gave Square some additional money, they will be hurt in the short-term if management continues to execute its current strategy that doesn't bring any profits.Red flag #3 is a combination of bad financials and lack of leadership inside the company, which I described above. Square plans to announce its earnings results for the FY16 on March 5, and I don't think that the situation will get any better. Until the company replaces its executive branch, I would stay away from and won't invest in its stock for the reasons described above.*Image Source: Twitter"
3791326,22148,2016-01-05T14:47:56-05:00,Square has sold off 10% this week after an analyst price target cut.Investors face the upcoming volatility of the first earnings report of the public company.The valuation doesn't warrant owning Square with the headline risk.,"One of the biggest risks investing in an IPO is the initial earnings report. For a new public company, investors have no reference as to how corporate executives guide, be it conservatively or by over-inflating growth expectations to attract investors. Not to mention, the confusing aspect of accurately reflecting the new share count in expectations and the general impact of more public awareness about the business, offset by an executive team distracted by the IPO process. The end result is a messy initial quarterly report.With the calendar changing to January, the market can now start preparing for the initial earnings report from Square (NYSE:SQ), with the stock down 10% this week. The mobile payments provider went public back in November with a weak pricing and a big pop after the open. Prior the IPO, I suggested investors wait on owning Square unless they get an opportunity to own the stock below $10.Combined with the alteration of the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) deal, is Square worth the risk heading into this potentially volatile earnings report?Outstanding SharesOne of the prime confusions heading into the initial earnings report after an IPO is that the share count isn't accurately reflected in the estimates and market data. After all, the whole point of the IPO process is to raise the share count. The increase in shares can actually help a stock like Square that generates large losses. The higher share count dilutes the loss per share and can help the company beat estimates.The IPO included 29.7 million shares sold by the company. Combined with the outstanding shares, Square reported 327 million shares outstanding after the IPO. Now this number has to be averaged for the amount of days the IPO shares were outstanding during the quarter to get the average diluted shares for Q4.Even with these numbers, the outstanding options aren't included due to the ongoing losses. So while the reported Q4 shares will under represent the total at the end of the period, it won't come close to representing the total outstanding when including all options listed in the S-1.Based on these numbers and the current stock price, the outstanding share count rises to over 440 million shares. At the current stock price of around $11.75, Square has a fully diluted market value of $5.2 billion.As an example of the confusion, popular investing sites like Yahoo Finance lists the market value of $3.8 billion. Anybody relying on that figure will undoubtedly disappointed when finding out Square is actually valued at a far higher rate.Business ShiftsPossibly the biggest impact to the quarterly results is the shift in the Starbucks' business. The company reported in the S-1 documents that the company was losing the business early, with Starbucks originally contracted to use Square for mobile payments through Q3 '16. The new deal started on October 1 allows Starbucks to shift away from Square payments along with a higher processing fee for remaining transactions that encourages a quicker move.For its part, Square published the adjusted revenue figure that excludes the Starbucks deal and transaction costs. The market though doesn't utilize that number meaning that headline figures will report the growth rate based on the inclusion of a gross revenue number. This number naturally includes Starbucks revenue.The general headlines will undoubtedly include a fear of slowing revenue growth even if the underlying adjusted revenue figure is solid. Analysts forecast Q4 revenues of $340 million compared to the $332 million produced in Q3. Combined with the forecast for Q1 revenues of only $320 million and the stock will struggle with that sequential revenue trend of flat to down.At the same time, Wedbush lowered the target on Square due to the high expense structure combined with a low payments monetization play. Analyst Gil Luria lowered the 2016 loss to an EPS of $(0.36). The number is still above the consensus loss of $(0.23).On a net revenue basis that excludes Starbucks, Square trades at over 11x revenues that will top $450 million. On a gross revenue basis, Square trades slightly cheaper than PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) that is worth nearly 4x estimated 2016 revenues.TakeawayThe investment picture remains mixed for Square. The initial earnings report is likely to bring disappointing headline numbers due to the loss of Starbucks revenues combined with a misunderstanding of the fully diluted share counts. With the expectation that the mobile payments provider continues generating sizable losses into 2016 and possibly beyond, investors don't have any reason to step into the stock prior to the initial earnings report that tends to provide a high level of volatility.The recommendation is to observe the quarterly report from the sidelines and wait for a better entry point."
3957551,22148,2016-03-10T17:21:55-05:00,Square reported generally positive Q4 numbers though the market is confused on which revenue total to utilize.The company is quickly moving beyond the winding down of Starbucks deal.The valuation is stretched when considering the fully-diluted share counts as the company doles out tons of stock options.,"In a not very surprising move, Square (NYSE:SQ) is down big following what appeared a solid Q4 earnings report. The confusing aspects of an initial earnings report following an IPO along with some particular aspects of the payments business were due to cause an unpredictable outcome. My prior recommendation was to chase the stock heading into this report and stick to purchasing the stock below $10, based on valuation.Source: SquareThe stock had rallied to the previous resistance around $12.50, so hitting a roadblock is common in these situations. The real question is whether Square will bounce after this sell-off today to set new highs or re-test the lows around $8.The Q4 numbers were generally extremely strong. The market though wasn't sure about the reported amounts as a general disconnect exists between net and adjusted revenues and the inclusion of Starbucks' (NASDAQ:SBUX) amounts.The Starbucks revenue will go away this year with the end of the deal between the two companies. For now, the revenues are net to zero gross profit with near identical transaction costs. Logically, Square removing these costs along with transaction costs leaves a more logical adjusted revenue. Using that number, revenues surged 64% during Q4 to $135 million.Source: Square Q4 2015 shareholder letterThe even more bizarre aspect of the financials is that nearly all investment sites list the net revenues, while Square provided guidance with the adjusted amounts. Based on the target to at least reach revenues of $600 million in 2016, the stock has a stretched valuation at the current fully-diluted market cap of around $5 billion. Due to ongoing losses, the company doesn't list the roughly 115 million shares tied to options and warrants highlighted in the previous article.The market now favors stocks that produce profits. In that regard, Square will struggle to see the stock move beyond the recent upper limits of $12.50. The lack of even breakeven EBITDA is a big overhang. Guidance of up to $12 million in positive EBITDA this year won't help.Square is spending substantial sums on building the top mobile payments system along with other financial-related options such as financing to build the best commerce ecosystem. In order to achieve this goal, the company is spending huge amounts on product development. During Q4 alone, Square spent nearly $60 million on technology improvements that was equivalent to 44% of adjusted revenues.The key takeaway is that Square remains a growth story with heavy spending for product development to help capture the enormous payments ecosystem. My previous recommendation to purchase the stock on dips below $10 remains intact."
3775926,89685,2015-12-29T06:00:00-05:00,"Aside the obvious practical solution, and broad customer base, the underlying fundamental strategy, card fees, and market fragmentation make it a low margin, high risk, difficult to profit business model.Dependency on ancillary sales making or breaking the profitability equation is essentially a strategy of giving the car away, with the vague hope customers buy upgraded tires and brake pads.IPO price being cut by 25% was driven by a very weak IPO market, coupled with skepticism related to a part-time CEO facing full-time issues at both his public companies.Market might sustain discounted valuation temporarily, but ultimately Square will begin to trade under more scrutiny, leaving me with a SELL Rating based on structural concerns and weak IPO environment.When available, options will be the best risk-adjusted approach, keeping in mind short-term boost from holiday sales may create temporary demand, but ultimately reality will bring Square down.","Introduction: Square and Twitter Share Same CEO, Similar IssuesThere is no doubt that Jack Dorsey is certainly one of Silicon Valley's ""SV"", greatest innovators. He has the gift of turning ideas into valuable enterprises, and the vision to execute that gift. This has led to the creation of two public companies within 3 years. His second, and most recent endeavor, Square Inc. (NYSE:SQ), is an easy to implement simple mobile point of sales system ""POS"", with related ancillary services such as payroll, analytics, and customer relations that support this main concept. By leveraging the familiarity, convenience, and on-the-go features of a smart phone or tablet, he created a company that solved a long standing issue related to payments for a variety of businesses on-the-go, or too small for other POS solutions. Small business sellers being able to accept credit cards, when having a traditional POS (point of sales) system was either not feasible, or convenient due to items such as fees (margin restriction), or location of business (an electrician working out a van), solved a very common problem, and in turn lead to a new business, Square Inc.(source)This simple, yet practical solution, made up of a small plug in device that a typical smart phone or tablet can process, created a POS system that is small, sleek in size design, and can be carried anywhere in order to accept credit or debit card payments. Unfortunately, that is about 90% of anything positive I see from SQ. Despite bringing two companies public in under 3 years, Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) well-publicized core strategy and management issues are reflected both in their performance, and the massive price volatility, sending TWTR plummeting to all-time lows well below their IPO, and forcing the board to bring back founder Jack Dorsey to run the company. Despite being two entirely different businesses, there are stark similarities between TWTR and SQ's issues such as a large dependence on massive volume businesses, with a constant need to innovate in highly competitive markets. For TWTR, growing MAUs is at the core of their valuation and success; for SQ, it's growing GPV (Gross Payment Volume). This article will focus on SQ's issues, but most investors can easily examine TWTR, and will see that the two long roads ahead have similar hurdles and pitfalls. If anything for SQ, we have seen this movie before, and so far it doesn't have a positive ending.This article will examine SQ's structural issues, product line, competitive environment, valuation, and why I feel it is best to avoid the stock as an investment. For those who like to speculate, SQ could make for a compelling long-term short position, preferably executed through the use of equity options.I am issuing a Sell Recommendation with a $9 price target based on broad assumptions and comparable valuation metrics. I essentially believe the IPO price was the ""full valuation"", with investment bankers selling the story well enough not to collapse when they came to market. As new issue equity with a lack of positive EBITDA, price targets are a function of broad analysis on comparable metrics such as price to sales (at this stage price targets are also very subjective). SQ could easily gain value in the short term, but as we will see, with even slight waves in the pool, the boat is extremely vulnerable to capsizing. After all, the captain is sailing two ships both in very rough seas, and one is already taking on water (Twitter). Over the course of the next two quarters, it is inevitable that the market will eventually scrutinize, and focus on the below issues, as they are quite difficult to ignore, and ultimately will bring SQ down to realistic valuations. As we will see, SQ is just another domino in a series of VC-backed SV IPO's showing immense weakness, in what has been a very tough market.SWOT Analysis:Often when facing a highly uncertain situation, whether related to investments or even life, I perform a simple SWOT analysis. For those who may be unfamiliar with the acronym, SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. This basic, but rather effective approach to an analysis is meant to lay the ground work, and identify important factors. We often complicate what in turns needs to be simplified, and think so hard we over look what is quite obvious and visible. Below we will break down SQ's S1, using this approach:Strengths - (Not Many, Besides First Mover Advantage)Weaknesses - (Too Many, that are too critical to success)Opportunities - (Few and far reaching, lower probability)Threats - (They are highly visible and already creating investor skepticism)As we see the strength of the company is wholly dependent on their simple to use solution, solving a very basic but necessary function for small businesses, in an unfortunately crowded space (no shortage of competition). From a painter, to a contractor, or any other type of business you can imagine, making your POS easy-to-use, on-the-go, and already linked to available hardware (Smart phone or Tablet), is responsible for the initial spike in growth. The large majority being small, under served, businesses which are a large addressable, but difficult market, highly sensitive to economic conditions. It also doesn't just provide transaction value, SQ offers various products and SaaS solutions that revolve around the main POS system that are all designed to create a SQ ecosystem for the seller (the essence of Jack trying to be like Steve). Just one problem, others can and are doing the same thing.Meanwhile in return, the value proposition to SQ is rather bleak on many fronts, but straight forward in terms of revenue streams. Besides the first mover advantage they gained, giving away the device for practically free (assume their own manufacturing costs), and make their money on the success of the small business, solely dependent on transaction volume is a very risky model. Furthermore, and most importantly, the space is riddled in competition that makes it even less likely to succeed on an enterprise level scale. This makes their business even more cyclical, especially with the majority of GPV being generated in the small business segment.The deterioration of their relationship with Starbucks is a clear indicator they will have a lot of trouble serving large, multinational enterprises. In an article here on SA, SA contributor Jeremy Raper makes a compelling, and very clear case that one good idea doesn't always translate into a viable business (Great read). He, as well as other authors have discussed the demise of the Starbucks relationship as a precursor to the vast competition, and few defense mechanisms in place for SQ to gain true growth, where scale translates into stronger capabilities. When we examine the adjusted numbers, it will be clear to see Starbucks leaving, puts SQ in a difficult place, especially without any other large customers to leverage as proof of concept and successful execution on that level. Before we get into the IPO market and relative valuations, let's go ahead and take a very close look at the products, services, and revenue opportunities SQ offers sellers, with their associated revenue models.Square's Product LineThe Ecosystem leveraged to the main product, and the ancillary, also undifferentiated add on services, leveraged on massive scale, without anything preventing the competition from copying, is a bad business model. Below we will see the vast, but rather undifferentiated secondary services and products SQ offers Sellers, eventually drawing an obvious conclusion rooted in valid concerns.In-Person PaymentOnline PaymentsSquare CashSquare RegisterSquare CapitalSquare Customer EngagementSquare Appointment, Market Place, and CavierTransaction revenue makes up 95% of the revenue stream, which in some ways is quite troubling for a business which has so many other services and hardware (minimal cross utilization). In order for SQ to increase ""up selling"" services that are integrated into their POS system, significant cap ex will be required, both on the product development side, and the human capital/sales force side of the business, in addition to evolving every aspect of the strategy. As one can see, the majority of the items above are free, or practically free, with the choice of more ""advanced"" analytical capabilities to improve sales, and similar ancillary services. There isn't anything unique about these services, as there are many competitors who offer SaaS to customers to manage inventory, human resource, and payroll functions all on a secure cloud platform. Solving these problems is extremely difficult, and the market is even more unforgiving. SQ has placed their hopes of healthier margins on being capable of driving better revenue numbers in the area of software and hardware, so the problem becomes quite clear when looking at the numbers, and the fact that each category on more advanced levels has differentiated leaders, whose sole focus is their SaaS (example Intuit).SQ Capital offers the company a valuable but risky way to provide liquidity to customers. Ultimately if a seller's only option would be that kind of deal, their credit quality would be lower, as the fees shown above are very high. Small businesses are always cash flow strapped, and giving away 10% off the top line doesn't offer the seller any significant value with rates this low. There are better options, and if the seller has the credit quality, they will already have established revolving credit facilities with local or large banks, thus leaving SQ with what seems lower credit quality customers, whose last resort is SQ Capital.In reality, besides selling the main POS services, there is little hope that the rest of the cap ex intensive offerings are going to be growth drivers facing significant competition. Eventually growth will slow, and cash will get burned faster, leaving investors to watch the valuation go down with it in flames.IPO Market Litmus Test Reading - Tis The Season To Stay PrivateTo say that this year has been brutal for SV IPOs, would be an understatement. The disconnect between private/venture capital market valuations, and shareholder structures, plays a deep role in the overall success of an IPO, which in turn fuels more growth in the Tech space with handsome returns at ambitious multiples, creating serious valuation traps. As with any good thing, 2015 has been a turning point in the market with respect to SV, and the valuations many companies are receiving privately reflect institutional demand to capitalize on years of rather ""frothy"" multiples, because liquidity has been cheap, and markets have been accommodative of the ""invest now for growth later"" concept. This is where significant capital is used in an attempt to increase growth, while remaining unprofitable in hopes of it all turning out for the best when you achieve massive scale necessary to succeed with this strategy (this topic can be its own article). The sentiment from the market only adds additional downside pressure the moment the story has a hiccup.The above relationship between private and public shifting, couldn't be any more evident by the price cut, and undersold book at the original range of $12-$14, as opposed to the $9 (2.9B valuation) final IPO, a serious discount to the last round of funding which valued the company at over $15.50 (4.5B). In addition to the price cut, a large portion of shareholders have provisions related to preferred shares from late round funding guaranteeing them a certain return, to which many are severely under water. We saw Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) go public on the same day as SQ, even though they actually have a sustainable and profitable business model, MTCH also had to cut the price for their IPO below the original forecasted range, which is a testament to the cold temperature in the IPO waters. After a very weak year for them, especially in the Tech or Internet categories, we are now seeing investors demand a discount related to valuation risk, and a lack of risk appetite in the market. This makes the likelihood or probability that the stock trades below its IPO much higher, especially after the lock-up expires, often tanking the stock. Below are recent examples:As we can see, SQ and MTCH both traded with a decent pop, but once you factor that the bankers had to significantly cut the price, these gains are really just a catch up in lost value, something seen as a sign of price instability and risk. Furthermore, almost all the above companies when you remove SQ and MTCH, are trading below their IPO price. Those are massive losses and disconnects between private and public market valuations, and a clear lack of tolerance and confidence. Aside Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), all of the above have similar issues that include a lack of profitability, macro environment that is unwary of riskier companies, a lack of barriers to entry with severe competition from the large enterprises they are trying to disrupt. AMZN is not a competitor you want in your space, yet they are competing in a variety of ways, including head on with their own cloud based services, and card reader.The examples above paint a clear picture of weakness. This has created a dangerous situation for valuations, and future IPOs from Silicon Valley. Venture Capital, Hedge Funds, and other institutional money managers who have sought out early to late stage exposure to the next big tech opportunities, are now going to be very weary as firms like Fidelity take markdowns over 20% in some cases. SQ won't have any ""hope"" built into the price, instead it will be under the very watchful, and critical eye of this unrelenting and risk adverse market.Square's Valuation AnalysisWith limited data, a short earnings history, and revenue growth reflecting embryonic stages of the business life cycle, valuations become very difficult to estimate, especially when we lack FCF or even a positive EBITDA. We have data that goes back to 2013 in their filings, both on a quarterly and annual basis. In reality the only accurate way to value SQ is to exclude and highlight all revenues and expenses related to dissolution of Starbucks, so we will use adjusted numbers. Before we do that, below we have the first round of analyst ratings coming, now that the quiet period has ended.Analyst Ratings and Price Targets(Source: FinViz.com)There is no surprise to see lead underwriter Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) express a buy rating. Other underwriters, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) have expressed overweight and equal weight ratings, respectively (no surprise or value there). As we can see above, estimates are mixed between Buy and Hold ratings, with price targets ranging from $11-$15 a share. What is interesting is Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) and Stifel (NYSE:SF) who are also involved in the deal have mixed ratings for the stock. It would be rare, for any firm to come out with a Sell rating, especially before their first quarterly report, and the 180 day Lock Up agreement expiration. GS and others also have the right to purchase up to 4.05M additional shares. Originally, the expected range was $12-$14 a share, with $13 being the midpoint, as of the S-1/A filed for the IPO. As we now know, demand for the shares was weak, forcing a 25% discount, in order to fill their books.The remaining firms issuing coverage were also mixed, but what is important to highlight is the price ranges are narrow, leaving investors looking at a best case upside of barely 20% from today's price of around $12.30, and a downside that very well could end a year from now well below $9 a share (-25%). The built in, essentially artificial 30% gain from the IPO price, is where I believe over time the price will revert, as valuations support my theory when examined on an adjusted basis (excluding Starbucks). To confirm my suspicions, let's go ahead and take a look at the price graph and their 9 month results from their S-1/A.Price - Range Since IPO $9-$14.53As we can see, the price has traded at a seriously narrow range, with roughly 450k shares trading daily (30M float). What is important to note is that on the first day of trading, the price tested, and could pass $14.78, the higher end of the original expected IPO. The market then dumped quickly, reverting to what has now been a month of very consolidated, light trading volume. What this really represents, is a lack of interest from the public, and a potential receipt for disaster, as investors anxiously await a break in either direction. Instead, early investors sitting on handsome gains (early stage Series A-C) are waiting until the lock up expires, with other potential buyers willing to step up once the value equation becomes more rational. The price may slowly float to test those previous highs, but from what it looks like, this is the calm before the storm, especially once they report their first 10Q and 10K as a public company. With the combination of all the negative factors, and under water investors, the end of the lock up expiration will also likely impact the price to the downside.Sales Figures and Valuation AnalysisSQ has grown adjusted 9 month revenues 63% Y/Y (50% unadjusted), with a gross margin of roughly 29% (260M/892M). Gross margin was calculated using 9 month unadjusted revenue, and cost of revenue. Despite having healthy growth, when one considers net revenue, and how much was attributed both on the revenue and cost side, less than half of net revenue is reflected in adjusted revenue, which more accurately reflects going forward the economic picture, but also exposes the gap Starbucks leaves behind. Things look even worse as SQ's thin margins will make profitability heavily dependent on hardware and SaaS.At these levels, without 4th quarter guidance, we used as a rough estimate Q4 2014 adjusted revenue of $75.1M and applied the 63% Y/Y Q3 2015 growth rate (observing no weakness in seasonality from Q3 to Q4 in 2014, Q3 2015 growth can thus be assumed conservative), and arrive at an expected total of $440.25M [($75*1.63)+$318M]. At a current $4.1B valuation, we arrive at near a 10x estimated sales multiple for SQ. That is ridiculously high to say the least. In comparison, PayPal currently trades at just half that valuation with a P/S multiple of 5x, and a market cap of over 48B with sales in excess of 8.8B. Despite the large P/E multiple for PayPal, they are profitable maintaining a sustainable business model with loyal customers, and are a significant competitor for SQ. This makes SQ seem at least 50% overvalued, especially when considering the surrounding factors, and the lack of profitability in the face of a severely elevated multiple, with large amounts of competition likely to slow their annual run rate over the next 2-3 years.When we examine the above, we see that SQ needs significant top line growth, as well as significant margin expansion, which can only come from hardware and software sales. Transaction costs are what make this an extremely high volume business, constantly requiring growing customer acquisitions as well as retention. The other major issue, is how sensitive SQ is to their Sellers' results. Lower GPVs, especially for small businesses, will ultimately result in growth issues, making them an inherently very cyclical business. This is a recipe for disaster if the economy has a slowdown, especially since SQ needs the economy to continuously tick upwards for at least the next two years as it seeks enough scale, and hopeful revenue diversity to establish any kind of protective barriers.Beware of the Lock-UpIn reality, due to the excessive private valuations, investors need to worry about dilution and the expiration of the lock up date. Coming public 25% below the estimated mid-point of $12, and preceding to trade range bound & locked ever since tightly around that mark, one must consider the various liabilities, investor interests, and associated risks when all restrictions are lifted. More than 50M of the preferred shareholders have a cost basis of $11 dollars to as high as $15. After their first quarterly report, it is logical that SQ will have a massive market adjustment, especially since we are trading at levels well below later rounds of private placements, and well below the first day pop that reached a high of $14.78, only to quickly selloff and flatten out between 11 and 12.50 over the last month.One such liability to consider is the 37M SQ will owe Starbucks, if shares of the stock don't reach $18.55 by October 2016, SQ will have to make up the difference on 2.27 million shares with a guaranteed 20% return, arising from certain warrants Starbucks owns.Those warrants right now are on the balance sheet as a Level III (hard to value) derivative liability, and will be marked up and down in value each quarter. In reality, there is really a built in liability of at least 8 Million [2.27M*(15-18.550], if SQ manages to beat all odds, and reach the high end of analyst price estimates of $15 (if it reaches my PT it could be a well over 18M cash liability in Q3 '16). In a future follow up, we will examine more closely the lock up date, as the multiple levels of currently underwater late stage investors, will take action based on a variety of different factors, most of which are unknown to us now. The key take away in this regard, is that SQ already has a series of investors underwater, making the odds of future pain much higher when we consider the massively competitive and difficult road SQ has in order to reach profitability.What's The Move - Put OptionsFor most investors, the move will be simply to sit back and completely avoid SQ, until my concerns are solved, and/or we have vivid proof that these doubts are proven wrong. Analyst won't come out this quick, and suggest a bearish position (a variety of unrelated reasons behind that fact). Personally, market makers are clearly leaning toward SQ going down in the long run, according to the options marketI am looking at the June 2016 $12 Put option for roughly $1.80, and will most likely hedge with shorter dated call options. The Feb 2016 $13 Call Option only costs .25 (while the $12 Feb Put costs .65), and offers a viable hedge one can roll forward at a fraction of your long dated put option. Others can simply just go long any Put option (in or out of the money), keeping in mind their basic option fundamentals, and wait for the price break out after Q4 earnings are released.When looking at going short such a young company, it only makes sense to use options, since there is a clearly defined risk, as opposed to outright shorting the stock. It is also prudent to sacrifice some potential gains to be hedged in some way in case the thesis takes a while to play out. Despite the elevated, and highly skewed option prices, the chances of SQ trading below $10.20 by June 2016 are quite high, and as indicated by market makers, more likely than trading up.Conclusion:The point of bringing the above issues to our attention is to highlight what the most likely medium, to long term outcome will be for SQ, based on numerous variables that include investor appetite and patience, a clearly broken business model, large amount of competition with few barriers to entry, a very weak amount of demand for the shares, and the worst IPO environment in years for SV ""Unicorns"". Of course the aforementioned variables are just a portion of the negatives. Just because we are clearly becoming a more digital economy with credit/debit cards making up more than 50% of transactions, with rapidly growing virtual commerce, and transaction security a genuine problem, SQ standing to be the large beneficiary over players like PayPal, Amazon, and many others who are or will compete in the space is a low probability event. The willingness to take such a cut to your valuation in order to go public at this stage showed desperation on their behalf, with a jumbled management situation to serve as the icing on the cake.Jack Dorsey got the idea for SQ by observing a friend unable to collect payment on the spot with a credit card, and saw how vast of a problem this truly was in America, and based on the trend of a digital economy, just how massive of an opportunity this solution could be for company. There is just one problem, they aren't the only player on the court, and will not likely see the end to intense competition. As we see above, the roughly 40B in GPV SQ will process this year is nothing compared to the estimated 7.6 T in card payments. Today, roughly only 9M out of the 30M estimate small businesses another picture depicts before the above in their filing only reveals the general opportunity to fill that gap, not a reason as to why they will achieve leadership. SQ chooses to highlight that 500k new business start every month, but fails to show how many are successful past 2 years. More than half fail, and with that failure so goes a SQ seller, and the need to replace them, which itself has an acquisition cost above just the hardware.Investors can see the practicality in the solution, but most logical investors can't see the profitability of the model. At best we are looking at a potential acquisition target if SQ can manage to create an ecosystem that really differentiates itself. In each ancillary category, including analytics, companies have solutions tailored and affordable that do the same thing.Jack Dorsey will forever have the world's respect as an innovator. In my eyes few can do what he has done, especially in the time period in which he manages to accomplish those goals. Unfortunately, he has yet to prove a sustainable growth model in either of his businesses to provide investors with confidence that ""Jack will figure it out."" With enough issues to drown just about any 'full-time' CEO, serving as a 'part-time' CEO, Jack faces an immense uphill battle on one leg, with half his investors already underwater.With the above considerations, and current market environment, I am initiating my coverage with a SELL Rating, and a price target of $9, indicating SQ will follow suit behind many other recent SV IPOs, whose prices are now trading below their IPO. I am betting on more unicorn blood, on Wall Street, with empirical evidence, as well as fundamental reasoning supporting this conclusion.Side Note: As a pair trade or better way to gain exposure to the massive growth in digital payment volume, and transaction security, I recommend reading my article on NXP Semiconductor: (NASDAQ:NXPI). As a chip provider for debit and credit cards, as well as a leading player in the NFC (near-field communication space), they are a good way to gain exposure without the rest of the negatives SQ, or other pure payments plays carry."
3773186,86396,2015-12-23T06:38:26-05:00,Vital information prospective investors should be aware of regarding the core of the business.Important Factors to Consider Before Purchasing Shares in This Company.Metrics and Factors To Keep an Eye on Going Forward.,"Square (NYSE: SQ), founded in 2009, has become quite the popular phenomenon among small business and merchants not only domestically but around the world. At its core, Square makes credit card readers that attach to mobile devices and make it quick and efficient for merchants to collect payments from the growing number of consumers that prefer the convenience of using a credit card, debit card, or their mobile devices.Square was co-founded by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey. Dorsey is also the co-founder of Twitter and currently serves as the CEO of both, Twitter and Square. He was appointed CEO of twitter in October of 2015.The business model and concept behind Square is quite genius. It's popularity among core consumers appears to be accelerating favorably. With that said, whether or not individual investors should start picking up some shares of this now publicly trade company is up for some discussion. Here are some factors to consider.The Strong Revenue Growth Comes with a Caveat  As outlined in the prospectus, although Square's sales for fiscal 2014 grew an astounding 54% to $850.2 million; net loss grew at almost the same rate reaching $154.1 million; an increase of over 48% from the $104.5 million lost during fiscal 2013. Square is not yet profitable.Majority of the business revenue for the business comes from a growing pool of merchants who not only purchase the physical device but also pay up to 2.75% in fees each time a customer swipes a card for payment. In 2014 alone, Square devices processed over one billion transactions. As per the S-1 filing, the business is on track to reach $1 billion in sales by the end of fiscal 2015.Even with the noted growth in revenue and number of transactions; bulk of the money goes to core and highly important parts of the business. For fiscal 2014; total transaction costs, which include payments to credit card networks and payment processors came in at over $450 million, a significant increase from the $277 million paid during fiscal 2013. Total operating expenses, which includes sales and marketing as well as product development, came in at over $376 million in 2014.Management Uncertainty  Although CEO Jack Dorsey is well tied to the business as the largest shareholder owning nearly 25% of Square's shares, and likely has a significant interest in the success of the business; we cannot ignore the fact that he is only one person. It is probably not likely that he will remain at the helm of both, Twitter and Square for very long.Both of these companies are still in an aggressive growing and development phase and need as much of the time and attention as they can get from leadership. As per a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, Dorsey usually spends half his day at Twitter before walking over to Square in the afternoons. Both offices are currently down the street from each other. As per representatives from both sides, Dorsey works about 18 hours a day.Despite Dorsey's intelligence, stamina, and undisputed talent; the lack of focus in one single business and long term management uncertainty can't possibly be favorable for either company.Competition  One factor that seriously worries me is how easy it would be for other companies to copy the Square business model and create their own payment processing devices. The business could easily be disrupted and market share could start to dwindle if the same services are offered elsewhere at a lower cost to merchants. Competition within the technology industry is extremely fierce and it is an environment that changes a lot quicker than many businesses would like.In Square's defence, they do appear to be the preferred service and a leader within their space at this point in time. They could probably keep merchants from jumping to another service by creating high switching cost. For instance, Square currently collects data from each transaction and provides information that could be valuable to merchants and small businesses regarding customer purchasing habits and other useful information. Switching can create unnecessary costs and the loss of valuable data.Although Paypal, Google Wallet, or even ApplePay are often compared to Square; its differentiation include the tangible physical devices that they offer merchants which allow for the ease of transactions. It goes beyond just an app to an actual physical product. Below are the core options offered:SourceWith that said, the business world is filled with competition that comes almost at lightning speed. And thus, it will be very important to keep a very close eye on any similar products emerging in the near future.Issues with IPO Pricing and Consequences  Prior to the IPO launch, Square made last minute agreements with major investors including JPMorgan Chase and Rizvi who agreed to buy shares at $15.46 contingent to a number of intriguing conditions. For instance, the agreement required the IPO be priced at $18.56 per share or higher otherwise both JPMorgan and Rizvi would be entitled to receive additional common shares of the stock.The plan of pricing the IPO at the agreed upon $18.56 did not materialize. The IPO was ultimately priced at $9 per share more than 50% less from the original agreement and well below the $15.46 per share secured from private investors. As a result, Square is now required to give the noted investors additional shares valued at $93 million which is the equivalent of about 10.3 million shares. As of the writing of this report, the stock is trading at $12.46 per share.Prospective Shareholders - Keep an Eye on These Factors:  If you love Square as a product and/or are intrigued by what they offer and would like to one day add this company to your diversified portfolio of stocks, consider the following:1. Wait for the business to stabilize to the point where revenue and profits exceed expenses and net losses, or at least the gap widens in favor of revenue.2. Wait a full fiscal year or two and see whether the business continues to grow and stays well ahead of any competitors. Keeping a close eye competition will be extremely imperative, specially in this space. This day and age similar companies tend to appear out of the wood works often time becoming a serious threat to first movers.3. Every quarter and full fiscal year I would carefully examine reports with a close eye not only on revenue, profits, number of transactions, and consumer acquisition growth but also on their debt obligations and revenue losses. If the business is able to turn around their EPS in to a positive territory, that'd certainly be a sign in the right direction.Conclusion and Final Thoughts I am a fan of the product and personally know many vendors that currently use Square's services and absolutely love it. However, as investors, we have a duty of looking above and beyond a product's popularity to determine whether it can sustain its growth momentum, differentiation, and competitive advantage over time.If you wish to one day own shares of Square keep a close eye on the points above and any other factors you personally consider important based on your own strategies as an individual investor. If this company is in fact a winner not only among its customers but as a business; any internal success at the core of this business should eventually be reflected in the stock price. Only time can tell where this will go but for now, consider proceeding with caution."
3772076,68985,2015-12-23T14:37:55-05:00,"Square, a leading mobile credit card processor for small businesses, completed its IPO last month at $9 per share. The shares are at $12.34 now (+37%).The company aims to leverage the expected expansion of the electronic payment sector. Credit cards are still king, but mobile payments are expected to continue to grow.We like the Square story, the industry and growth potential, and intend to stay on top of this name.","Square Post-IPO Price PerformanceFounded in 2009, Square (NYSE:SQ) is a leading mobile credit card processor for small businesses. The company aims to leverage the expected expansion of the electronic payment sector. Square completed its IPO last month at $9 per share, which was below the original expected price range of $11 to $13. The shares closed at $12.34 on Friday, December 18, which represents a 37% increase since the November 19 IPO.Credit Cards Are King… But Mobile Expected to GrowPayments have become increasingly card-based over time, with credit, debit and pre-loaded cards replacing checks and cash for many purchases. Electronic payments are now also gaining market share compared to cash and checks. The 2013 Nilson Report indicates that electronic payments comprised 8.7% of total paid expenditures in 2007 and are forecast to grow to 10.6% by 2017, which we believe could prove to be conservative based on more recent data.Mobile Payments Infrastructure LagsOne factor constraining the growth of mobile payments has been the lack of appropriate infrastructure, both on the merchant and consumer end. Penetration of POS (point of sale) digital card readers is still at early stages, and the U.S. also lags other nations in installing this POS technology. Relative to the rest of the world, ""the evolution of the U.S. retail payment infrastructure has been comparatively slow,"" according to MasterCard (NYSE:MA).First Data (NYSE:FDC) confirms that widespread adoption of mobile payments has lagged in the U.S., indicating that this is ""primarily due to the greater complexity of its financial and communications ecosystems,"" including a ""diverse array of handset manufacturers, mobile network operators, financial institutions, and payment networks,"" which have had difficulty reaching agreement on m-commerce standards and economics along the value chain.We expect U.S. infrastructure to catch up, reflecting the convenience mobile POS payment technology offers both customers and merchants. Mobile payment enables many small businesses to complete transactions they could not accept before because they were not equipped to take credit card payments. In addition, mobile contactless payments are generally faster and more convenient for many types of transactions. Consumers can pay for purchases by passing their phone near a point of sale terminal using NFC (near-field communication) technology, which allows two devices placed within close proximity to exchange data, as long as both devices are equipped with an NFC chip.As of early 2012, only a small percentage of U.S. smart phones supported NFC contactless mobile payments. However, as people upgrade their smart phones - U.S. consumers average an upgrade every 1.7 years - NFC penetration is expected to rise. Generally, mobile phone manufacturers are including NFC capabilities in newer models. NFC smartphone sales have grown 55% in 2015, according to NFC World data, and banks and processors saw a 400% increase in NFC-based mobile transactions during the beginning of the holiday shopping season this year, according to Mobile Payments Today.This is good news for small businesses that have found traditional payments solutions prohibitively expensive and difficult to use and potentially for Square, we believe. Some small vendors are denied service by traditional credit card providers. An estimated approximately 20 million domestic businesses do not accept card payments today, according to Square, which aims to address their needs. Enabling mobile contactless payments means that businesses generally need to install new technology from Square or another provider. Many leading retailers have already upgraded their POS capabilities, but among smaller chains and mom & pops, the upgrade is occurring more slowly. According to a Hospitality Technology study, 38% of restaurant businesses surveyed plan to develop or deploy a mobile POS solution.Growing Apple Pay Reach Will HelpGrowing mobile penetration and increased consumer reliance on mobile shopping apps that provide price comparisons or product reviews are also expected to fuel mobile device spending. Moreover, Apple (AAPL) Pay and other digital wallets, which are expanding their footprints and marketing their services, is also likely to drive usage by broadening access to digital payment options and boosting consumer awareness. This is also good news for Square, which processes Apple Pay and Android Pay transactions.There are roughly 1.3 billion active credit and debit accounts globally compared to about 5.3 billion active mobile phone accounts. Recent data indicates that mobile payment is growing globally at approximately 50% each year.The current transition to EMV (Europay-Mastercard-Visa (NYSE:V)) technology could also be a catalyst for growth. EMV is a global standard for credit cards equipped with computer chips. This technology is different from the traditional metallic strip on older credit cards. Square's EMV-enabled terminals and others are also equipped with contactless functionality.Square offers direct exposure to the expected continued growth of mobile payments. We believe it warrants attention but also note several uncertainties. In its prospectus, Square indicated that, ""... we do not intend to renew our payment processing agreement with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) when it expires in the third quarter of 2016. Further, ... Starbucks has announced that it will transition to another payment processor and will cease using our payment processing services altogether prior to the scheduled expiration of the agreement in the third quarter of 2016. As a result, Starbucks payment processing volumes will decrease meaningfully in the future.""Square has positioned this as a positive, as the economics on the Starbucks deal are unattractive. For example, in the first nine months of 2015, Starbucks accounted for 11% of Square's total revenue but 19% of total direct costs. Moreover, the 10% annual growth in the Starbucks revenue was a drag on the 56% revenue expansion the company would have recorded excluding Starbucks.Improving ProfitabilityThe company reported 2015 (through September) gross margin of 29%, up from 26% in the same period of 2014. Excluding Starbucks, gross margins would have been 36% and 35%, respectively. That's a big difference. Therefore, the elimination of the Starbucks business is expected to have a positive impact on the company's gross margins and overall profitability, as Starbucks contributed negative gross margins of nearly 25% in both periods. Gross margins of the company's transaction business, which accounts for the majority (84%) of total revenue, held relatively steady at about 36% in the first 9 months of both years.As Square replaces the Starbucks revenue through transactions with a growing number of smaller businesses, we expect a gross margin lift. The company charges a roughly 2.75% per transaction fee, which is generally better for vendors than other payment options. The fee has been fairly stable over time, according to the company, and Square's adjusted revenue (non-Starbucks revenue - transaction costs) has held stable at roughly 1.0%-1.2% of GPV (gross payment volume), as illustrated below. Square has ""introduced pricing programs to attract newer larger customers."" In addition, as existing customers grow and presumably negotiate terms, we would not be surprised to see some pressure on average per transaction fees over time, but we do not expect it will be significant. At this early stage in the development of this young industry, we believe Square pricing is likely to remain relatively stable for the foreseeable future.In fact, the opportunity to increase consolidated pricing and margins comes from the company's launch of additional SaaS cloud based products and services, we believe. According to its prospectus, Square has ""extended [its] product and service offerings to include financial services and marketing services, all to help sellers start, run, and grow their businesses.""The company introduced Square Capital in May 2014 and Square Cash in November 2013. Square Capital extends cash advances to customers on the payment platform and has already extended more than $300 million of cash advances over 50,000+ transactions. That equates to an average of about $6k per transaction and reflects the company's focus on the small mom & pops. Square Cash allows users to make debit card-based digital payments via email or a mobile app. Customers have spent $1+ billion through Square Cash since its inception. Square Customer Engagement offers marketing support for businesses on its platform.The company's SaaS business is small. At $35.6 million, it accounted for only 4% of total revenue in the first nine months of 2015, but grew nearly 6-fold off a small base. The SaaS margin for the period was 61%. As this business grows, we expect a lift on consolidated gross margins and move towards positive EBITDA generation. Over the past eight quarters, all but one have registered negative adjusted EBITDA (the company generated $859k of adjusted EBITDA in the June 2015 quarter).The company needs to balance new product launches with its goal to reach sustainably positive EBITDA so that growth investing does not constrain operating margins and cash flow, in our view. In fact, the above noted SaaS 61% margin was down from 82% in 9 months of 2014, presumably as the company ramps this business unit. We also believe the company needs to be strategic about the new services it launches. Offering payroll services, for instance, is competitive (see our note Paycom Vs. Paylocity), although probably less so in the small mom & pop niche.Separately, Square CEO Jack Dorsey is also the CEO of Twitter, and there has been some discussion in trade publications questioning whether one person can steer two such companies well. Perhaps that remains to be seen. We like the Square story, the industry background and the growth potential. We intend to stay on top of this name, although are not ready to buy the shares yet. Improving margins, strategic introductions of new profitable businesses, moving closer to positive EBITDA generation and international expansion could all be positive catalysts."

Square's (NYSE:SQ) recent IPO leaves 27 million shares tradable, and 295.9 million additional shares eligible for sale after 5/17/2016 (SOURCE: Square S-1/A). I recently wrote a piece, Fitbit: Beware the Dilution, discussing the dilution equity investors in Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) would experience given the large amount of options granted to employees and the potential for selling pressure surrounding the 47% of shares available for sale after the lock-up expiry ends around 2/7/2016. Several commenters wondered how lock-up expiration affected recent IPOs on average, and if anyone had studied it. I decided to look into it, and was surprised by what I found.MethodologyMy dataset included the 100 largest deals of the last five years of IPOs, not including secondary offerings. I didn't use the IPO price; IPOs are typically priced cheaply so the first trades are higher out of the gate, and most investors don't get full allocations of IPO shares, especially hot ones. I wanted to get an idea of what a secondary market investor would see as a return if he bought after the IPO was free to trade.I started with the stock price five business days after the new issue, to eliminate any manipulation from a stabilization bid, and to give the stock a little time to settle down from a volatility perspective. I compared that price to the stock price on the date of the first lock-up expiry, to generate a holding period yield. I used the lock-up expiry date, and not a period after lock-up expiry because investors are forward looking and would presumably be discounting the lock-up expiry impact as it approached. I then ran a simple statistical analysis package on the returns to see what they produced on average.ResultsThe biggest takeaway was a bit of a shock to me. If an investor bought five days after a new issue and held through lock-up expiry, on average, he would essentially be flat at +0.62%. On average, the lock-up expiration has little impact. My sample was from a pool of 7,000 or so deals, so the actual mean is within a -4.17% to 5.41% range, based on the sample's standard error. Even though, on average, an investor's performance would be flat, the ride would be very wild; standard deviation came in at a whopping 24.15%, meaning that 95% of the deal returns came within a massive range of -46.71% to 47.95%. Those numbers aren't annualized, either. Keep in mind the average term to lock-up expiry was 181 days, meaning that a rough annualization of those returns (multiplying standard deviation by square root of 365/181) would be -65.96 - 68.45%!Histogram of Returns through Lock-Up Expiry ImplicationsSo what are the implications for a stock like Fitbit or Square?The mundane 0.62% average return really only applies to investors that are always buying every new issue in the secondary, such as a passive replicator of a broad market index. For every other investor who may only buy a few recently issued names, doing due diligence and knowing the fundamentals of the company are a must; you will see extreme amounts of volatility, and you must be prepared to respond accordingly. As an investor, I was personally on the fence on Fitbit, as the stock looks cheap but the lock-up is large. These results only heighten my caution as extreme levels of volatility outweigh any comfort knowing that ""on average"" returns are flat to slightly positive."

The U.S. delivered 11% growth while international growth was flat. International processed transaction growth is 13% when you normalize for the transfer of domestic processing in Russia that started at the end of April.The only slowdown Visa faced was in Russia, due to trade embargos and geopolitical turbulence in the region.Similarly, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) saw double digital volume and transaction growth in most of its markets. It is also innovating its payment technology. By the end of 2017, all cards will support NFC and will be chip-capable. This EMV technology will strengthen the moat Mastercard, Visa, and American Express (NYSE:AXP) have I the smart payment, automated teller machine, and payment terminals market.Bullish investors are betting Square's GPV mix will contribute meaningfully to earnings.Similar to other young firms, Square will also face costs growing faster than that of revenue. The company said it will make ""significant investments in our business, including with respect to our employee base; sales and marketing, including expenses relating to increased direct marketing efforts, referral programs, and free hardware and subsidized services; development of new products, services, and features; expansion of office space and other infrastructure; expansion of international operations; and general administration, including legal, finance, and other compliance expenses related to being a public company.""Square is not a short…yetSquare's CEO, Jack Dorsey, is a talented leader. He is getting a token salary of just $3,750 (he owns 24.4 percent, or 71.1 million shares in the company). Still, his leadership may not bring positive earnings fast enough for an impatient stock market. Similar to Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) stock, Square may trade higher only on stock market momentum alone in the short-term. As insider lockups expire, though, the stock may fall, just as Twitter did months later.TWTR data by YChartsThe bottom lineInvestors should steer clear of Square's stock.

3704956,69145,2015-11-22T20:04:44-05:00,Square finished its IPO at a fairly early stage.There are some uncanny similarities with the financial state of Square and Twitter when they went public.Has Twitter's performance foreshadowed Square's future performance?,"Square (NYSE:SQ), like most IPOs, runs on stories. How an unprofitable company got into the market is beyond me. There are parallels between Dorsey's new company and his older one, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), that makes me believe that Square is on track to cause major headaches to investors who will focus on the future and not pay attention to current results.Square was founded in 2009 and just went public. It is approximately six years in business and is unprofitable. Twitter was founded in 2006 and went public in 2013. Interestingly, both went public in November in their respective years. Both companies are very young. Just as Twitter has shown, I would say that Square needed to stay private for a bit longer until it showed signs of profitability before entering the public markets.Take a look at the two financials below. The first table is Square and the second is Twitter. Notice the general similarities. Net income and cash flows are negative despite increasing revenues. What struck me as interesting is that both companies had increasing revenues and increasing negative free cash flow in their respective years as they finished their IPOs. Everyone in the investment world touts the philosophy of Warren Buffett, but no one seems to apply his sage wisdom. You just do not invest in companies that have not proven themselves out. Like Twitter, Square is still trying to prove its concept out. There is no moat established. For GARP investors, what did Peter Lynch say? He said that you need to see a tendency in growing earnings. Square shows the complete opposite.(Source: Morningstar-Square)(Source: Morningstar-Twitter)Here is where things get much more interesting. Below I extend the table and show you how worse off Twitter has been since it went public. Revenues have been increasing, but it has become very obvious that the net income and free cash flow numbers are accelerating in the wrong direction. I do not want to draw any conclusions but based on the youth of Square and the fact that it may be losing one of its biggest customers, Starbucks, I think Twitter's performance foreshadows Square's future.(Source: Morningstar-Twitter)S-1 filingsI took a look at both companies' S-1 filings to see if there were any similarities. Four of the banks who underwrote Twitter's IPO underwrote Square's. I'm very curious to know why these banks would want Square to go public given that its financials going into the IPO were much worse off than Twitter's. It may not mean much to some people, but I would not trust their judgment this time for their poor judgment last time.Source: TWTR S1 and SQ S1)When it came down to the business, models of both appear to be similar.If you notice, both the business models appear to be driven by ease of access and their simplicity. However, it's this focus on simplicity that has resulted in the downward trajectory of Twitter's stock. We saw how the simplicity of creating tweets resulted in more garbage than useful information. As a result, Wall-Street beat the stock down for not hitting expectations and consistently compared it to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Square may face a similar problem. Its primary market is the mom and pop shops, but if they do not adopt Square quick enough, Wall Street will be demanding the company to change its model, forcing them to possibly go to the big box retailers. We saw this happen with Dick Costello, former CEO of Twitter. He was trying to cater and appease Wall Street by inventing new metrics, molding the company to their liking. Finally, he gave up and resigned. I'm not saying that will occur with Dorsey, but he may have to choose which company he spearheads if Square fails to perform within the first year.Rather than put money in Square immediately, wait until the numbers show that it's ripe for investment. Otherwise you are risking your money on a ""hot"" story."

This represented a 38% discount to the $6 billion valuation that Square received during its last round of venture capital funding.At first blush, it appeared that the Square IPO transaction was a failure, causing early investors to sustain an unrealized loss on their position, and exposing a low level of demand for ""unicorn"" tech companies (startup technology firms with a valuation above $1 billion).But as shares began trading in the open market, Square's IPO started looking more and more like a successful transaction.Strong Demand Boosts Market Value of SquareWhile the $9.00 offering price for Square was disappointing, investors' initial reaction to the deal offered an entirely different perspective. Within the first half hour of public trading, Square jumped to $14.78 before settling into a range near $13 for the rest of the day. SQ closed at $13.07, up 45% from the offering price.So while SQ was forced to sell its initial shares at a discount to the expected range, by the end of Square's first day of trading, shares were actually back above the top end of the projected IPO range. This dramatic increase in Square's price could be interpreted two ways:First, investors could view the $9.00 pricing as a failure on the part of underwriters. Shares were obviously sold at a discount to market demand as evidenced by the buy orders which drove shares of Square higher. By selling shares at $9 instead of $13, Square missed out on $100 million in cash that could have been raised according to Bloomberg.The second way of interpreting the move is that Square's IPO was actually a success because the company managed to create a public market for its shares and on the first day of trading, the market valued Square at $4.2 billion. (Square will have 322.94 million shares outstanding, valued at $13.07 per share.)While this is still short of the 6 billion valuation that Square commanded in its last venture capital funding round, It still represents a valuation that is 45% above where the company was priced by the IPO underwriters, and even a small premium to the high-end of the range investors were originally expecting.Minimal Dilution and a Bullish MarketWhen looking at the details of Square's IPO transaction, it'is important to note that only a small portion of the company was sold to public investors. Square offered 25.65 million shares in the deal along with 4.05 million additional shares that were available for underwriters to purchase.Given the 45% increase from the IPO price, we can assume that the underwriters will definitely take advantage of this option. So all told, Square is selling 29.7 million shares to investors.Compared to the 297.3 million shares that were outstanding before these shares were issued, Square's IPO diluted previous investors in the company by almost exactly 10%. Offsetting this dilution is roughly $250 million in cash that Square was able to add to its balance sheet from the transaction. (29.7 million shares times $9 per share less a portion of proceeds set aside for the underwriters brings the total to near $250 million.)The fact that Square rallied in the public market, however, gives both the company and the private investors who were diluted by the IPO some much better options.To begin with, there is now a liquid market for SQ shares - a market that values these shares at $13.07. If the market continues to price shares near $13, Square can ultimately raise more cash at a higher valuation. And private investors can exit their positions at a price that is higher than the IPO price from this morning.More importantly, a rise it the share price gives investors confidence and may help drive demand for shares of SQ. If the stock had originally been priced at $13 and the stock had closed at $13.07 as it did today, selling pressure would likely set in quickly. The risk of the stock falling below its IPO price would be too great and investors would have an incentive to sell shares before this risk came to pass.But by pricing the shares low, and allowing the stock to trade higher, the underwriters engineered a bullish environment for the stock. Yes, some IPO investors will want to sell soon to lock in profits. But other investors will see the 45% increase from SQ's IPO price and will be encouraged by the prospect of further growth.This type of pricing (setting the initial price low and allowing the stock to gap higher) can often create more interest from speculative traders, which can help foster liquidity. And this liquidity will be important if SQ wants to raise more capital by selling shares over the next few months.Where To From Here?To be sure, Square is a speculative investment as the company has yet to turn an annual profit. Square reported a loss of $131.5 million during the first three quarters of this year. This is an expansion from the $117 million loss sustained in the first three quarters of 2014.On the bright side, Square is actively growing its base of vendors for which the company clears payments. According to the offering documents, Square's net revenue hit $892.8 million in the first three quarters of 2015, up 49% from the same period last year.Bloomberg offered an interesting chart which shows that at Square's IPO price the company is valued at 3.8 times the previous 12 months of sales compared to only slightly lower valuations for payment processors Vantiv (VNTV) and Global Payments (NYSE:GPN).(Source: Bloomberg)But while Square's revenue has been growing at a 45% annual rate Vantiv only grew revenue by 17% last quarter and Global Payments is only growing its revenue by single digits.(Source: YCharts)Based on this metric, it seems that Square's premium valuation is more than justified. And if the company is able to continue signing up new customers and processing payments through its easy to use interface, the stock price could continue to rally.The biggest challenge that I see for Square investors right now is the company's ability to protect its intellectual property. If Square can continue to be the ""go-to"" vendor for small businesses because of its easy setup and seamless payment system, then growth will continue and Square's valuation will continue to expand.But if Square is unable to continue to differentiate itself from other payment processors, investors will have a hard time justifying its $4.2 billion valuation and shares will trade lower.For now, I'm optimistic and I believe that the company's successful IPO transaction is the first step toward creating a profitable public market for Square investors."
3793446,24157,2016-01-06T11:33:19-05:00,"Square's business model provides great benefits to small to mid sized businesses.However, the business model requires significant overhaul to reach expectations baked into stock price.Ignore strong revenue growth as the underlying business is destroying shareholder value.","Recent IPO Square (NYSE:SQ) is in the Danger Zone this week despite its noble cause of providing payment solutions for small to medium businesses because it checks many of the Danger Zone boxes: questionable non-GAAP accounting, non-competitive business models, and an extremely risky valuation.Ignore Revenue Growth, Look For Profits (Or Lack Thereof)Investors love IPOs that tout impressive revenue growth, especially in an industry which pundits believe is ""ripe for change,"" such as the payment processing industry. The risk of focusing on revenue growth is that it does not always mean there are any profits. Square's revenue growth, 104% compounded annually since 2012, has occurred while generating losses and not any after-tax profit (NOPAT). In fact, NOPAT has fallen from -$80 million in 2013 to -$121 million in 2014. Figure 1 illustrates this disconnect between revenue and profits.Figure 1: Square's Revenue IllusionSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsSquare's business model exhibits the same trait we have seen in many cloud based software companies: expenses are growing much faster than revenues. From 2012-2014 the company's cost of goods sold, product development and sales & marketing costs have risen respectively 119%, 76% and 41% compounded annually.Furthermore, the capital being deployed into the business has not been done so efficiently as Square's return on invested capital (ROIC), which was -30% in 2013 , remains a bottom quintile -33% on a trailing twelve month (TTM) basis.Despite what management would have you believe, expanding the business has been extremely costly and destructive to shareholder value.Non-GAAP Metrics Are MisleadingWe've previously highlighted the dangers of non-GAAP earnings, whether it in IPOs or long-standing companies. Unfortunately for investors, Square uses non-GAAP metrics that serve no purpose but to make an unprofitable business look ""less unprofitable."" Square uses three different non-GAAP and misleading metrics:Competition Puts a Cap on Growth and Profit PotentialSquare faces ample competition in the payment processing industry. In fact, point of sale terminal providers Verifone (NYSE:PAY) and Ingenico are estimated to have a 49% global market share of the POS terminal market. Additionally Square faces competition from other payment processors like Vantiv (NYSE:VNTV) and First Data (NYSE:FDC), who are estimated to have a combined 53% market share of processing volume. We haven't even mentioned competitors such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), or any number of private startups who also provide mobile payment solutions.MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V), companies which benefit from Square's payment terminals, are also building their own mobile payment applications which could encroach upon Square's turf. MA and V have deep pockets and a large network. All this competition culminates to create an extremely crowded and competitive industry landscape.Worst of all, as seen in Figure 2, Square is the least profitable of its many competitors, and it's not even close. It's hard to see how SQ can compete in this environment.Figure 2: Square's ROIC Creates Competitive ChallengesSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsBull Case Requires A Sticky Business ModelSimilar to our insight into Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) flawed business model, another Jack Dorsey creation, Square's business model has a fatal flaw. The more value it provides to its users via access to the vast world of credit card commerce, the less value it offers stock holders.. The more Square raises the prices it charges users, the smaller its addressable market and the more it may alienate its existing customers and see market share loss. On the other hand, maintaining its low-cost status-quo leaves Square serving the merchants that larger providers deemed too risky, unprofitable, or both, which is currently reflected in Square's large negative profits. Moreover, the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) deal is a great example of how unprofitable and unsuccessful dealing with larger customers can be. For Square to gain traction in any larger businesses, it would have to supplant the existing payment system in place, which could entail lowered transaction fees or volume discounts, i.e. Starbucks agreement.To come close to reaching the heights implied by Square's valuation, Square must provide something sticky, something that merchants cannot get elsewhere. Unfortunately, we see noting of the sort…that is profitable anyway. Square's payment terminals are nothing special (they give many of them away), and many other competitors, including PayPal and Intuit have already created their own. Aside from simple payment terminals, the digital and mobile space exists as an avenue for expansion. Unfortunately Square has attempted mobile wallet type applications, competing with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Wallet, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay, or any number of mobile applications that allow for payment such as Starbuck's own mobile app, to no avail. Additionally, Square is still a small player in the digital and mobile payment space. In fact PayPal, which processed nearly $70 billion in payments during 3Q15 alone, dwarfs Square, which processed $25.5 billion in payments through the first nine months of 2015.Is Square Hoping to Be Acquired?With so many competitive challenges and little inherent value proposition, some investors must be hoping for a buyout to justify the lofty valuation they have assigned to SQ. While Square's technology might be easily replicated, one could make the argument that its customer data on spending habits or transaction values could be worth acquiring.If we assume Vantiv acquires Square and upon acquisition Square immediately achieves Vantiv's margins and ROIC, the company would still have to grow revenue by 31% compounded annually for the next 25 years to justify buying Square at it's current price (~$12/share). A more realistic price for Vantiv to pay is $5.50/share, which is the value of SQ's business based on the value of the firm if it achieves VNTV's 12% NOPAT margin in year 1 of the acquisition.Hidden Liabilities Make Buyout Even More UnlikelySquare has some hidden liabilities that make the company even more expensive than the standard accounting numbers suggest:In addition to these liabilities, Square has $144 million in debt, which represents 4% of its market cap. While these hidden liabilities detract from the overall value of Square the likeliest competitor to purchase Square would be another payment terminal provider, like in our scenario above. We find it hard to believe another provider would want to serve the unprofitable merchants Square currently serves. Lastly, it's unlikelythat a card provider such as Visa or MasterCard would acquire Square as it is more beneficial for them to allow Square to take on the risk of providing payment terminals and simply collect the transaction fees once Square sets up the system.With or Without Acquisition, Valuation Is Unrealistic Given Square's OperationsSquare IPO'd at $9/share, well below the $11-$13 range that was previously indicated and 30% below a private fundraising round just a year ago. Despite the already sinking valuation, investors saw this as a ""buy the dip"" opportunity and shares now trade at $12/share. To justify the current price, Square must immediately achieve pre-tax margins of 5% (-14% in 2014) and grow revenue by 26% compounded annually for the next 16 years. In this scenario, Square would be generating $32.7 billion in revenue 16 years from now, which is slightly more than all the competitors' 2014 revenue in Figure 3 combined.Even if we assume a ""best case scenario"", in which Square is able to achieve 9% pre-tax margin (above competitor VeriFone but below Vantiv, which provides more than just payment processing) and can grow revenues by 23% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is only worth $7/share today - a 42% downside.Catalyst: Loss of Starbucks A Sign Of Things To Come?Square entered into an exclusive deal with Starbucks in 2012 and this deal will end on or before 3Q16. In its S-1 Square revealed that this agreement was nothing but a money losing venture. From 2012-2014 Square had gross losses of over $56 million on the deal. However, Starbucks accounted for 14% of revenue in 2014, which makes it a large part of Square's business. When companies that lack profits go public, investors cling to top line growth as proof the business model is working. With the loss of Starbucks, Square must not only make up this revenue, but find other avenues to grow the top line or risk seeing severe investor backlash in the form of share price tanking. Unfortunately, the market eventually wakes up to the reality that these revenue growth business provide no value to investors and shares adjust downward accordingly. Take for example Box and Demandware two recent high revenue growth stocks that are down 35% and 30% respectively since being put in the Danger Zone.Also Beware The Venture Capitalist ""Cash Out""Did Square go public because it needed capital? Or did it go public to line the pockets of early/VC investors who are looking for an exit?Of the 322 million shares outstanding after the IPO, only 27 million shares were part of the IPO. 92% of shares outstanding are locked up for 180 days. After the lock-up expires, IPO buyers could be in trouble as the existing investors cash out and look for the next unicorn. As we noted in this detailed report, IPO investors must beware of the risks presented by investing in IPOs with large insider/venture capital investments.The lock-up expiration and Square's dependency on high revenue growth could provide the ultimate 1-2 punch knockout for SQ.Executive Compensation Provides Little AccountabilitySquare's executive compensation is particularly vague. The compensation committee has discretion over all metrics chosen from which to base executive bonuses on. Unfortunately for investors, these metrics include, but are not limited to any number of GAAP and non-GAAP targets such as revenues, EBIT, EBTIDA, adjusted EBITDA, stockholder return, sales bookings, or even ROI, just to name a few. We would prefer to see a more clear-cut compensation plan with specific criteria, one of which should be ROIC as it has been proven to be a driver of shareholder value creation.Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingWe have made several adjustments to Square's S-1. The adjustments are:Income Statement: we made $33 million adjustments with a net effect of removing $33 (4% of revenue) million in non-operating expenses. We removed less than $1 million in non-operating income and $33 million in non-operating expenses.Balance Sheet: we made $217 million of balance sheet adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of $19 million. The largest adjustment was the inclusion of $115 million related to operating leases. This adjustment represented 33% of reported net assets.Valuation: we made $1.1 billion of shareholder value adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by 1.1 billion. The most notable adjustment to shareholder value was the removal of $515 million due to preferred stock. This adjustment represents 13% of Square's market cap.Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."

Commodity bubbles popped. The oil bubble popped. China popped. The biotech bubble popped. Meanwhile, the overall market, while it has certainly suffered corrections, has generally moved forward.Each time a bubble popped, people were caught out and lost money. What's most remarkable is these were often people who were already rich, people who thought they were smarter than the public markets, and who had the wherewithal to go around them.Now, hedge funds and venture capitalists are feeling that popping sound. The so-called ""unicorns"" are popping. The failure of Square (NYSE:SQ) and Match (NASDAQ:MTCH) to make their full valuations as they go public today is the sound of that bubble popping. It's a good thing.Public markets are the best means we have for ascertaining price and value. Transparent, open markets, with lots of participants on each side of every trade, have a way of separating value from hype. Private equity and venture capital investors have deliberately avoided the public markets this decade, or sought to control them, thinking they knew better.What we're seeing, now, is the failure of this model, smart guys getting outsmarted, or outsmarting themselves. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square has lost one-quarter of its value this year. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has closed its macro hedge fund, and this is expected to be the worst year for the industry since 2011.It's funny, because I'm doing quite well, and chances you are too. (You're not down 24.5%, are you?) It turns out taking big positions and trying to blackmail executives into handing you money is no better a strategy than looking at fundamentals and investing for the long haul.Something similar is happening in the venture capital industry. Funds have been putting hundreds of millions into companies like Uber (NYSE:UBER), based on insane claims of valuation that had not been tested in the public market, and they're finding, when they finally emerge, that the businesses are just not as valuable as advertised.Square, for instance. It was supposed to ""revolutionize"" payments. It didn't. It has a smartphone dongle that connects small merchants to existing payment systems. It has a single, straightforward deal, a discount of 2.75%, which is fine if you don't yet have a merchant account, but not so great if you have an operating business. In that case, your bank can evaluate your risks and probably do better by you. Square's real value was giving small businesses the ability to look at the meta-data created by transactions and create reports off them. That's nice, but it's not that big a deal, especially when the tiny businesses that create them don't really know how to use those reports to create change.Match is the same. Hasn't anyone ever seen ""Hello Dolly?"" That's all Match sites do, the same work Dolly Levi did. It picks files that seem to look similar and offers them back to people. It's a card trick. It's useful, for people who have a hard time finding other people - and lots of us do - but it's not worth nearly as much as Match's venture capitalists think it is.Chances are there are lots of other such deals out there. Uber is valuable, but not nearly as valuable as its investors think right now. It's true that venture capital has created a lot of valuable businesses. But until value is tested in the public market, value is just a guess.The popping of the bubbles among hedge funds and venture capital funds is actually a very good thing. They prove that the wisdom of crowds, on which public investment has worked for hundreds of years, remains the truest market wisdom. Liquid investments, unlike illiquid ones, can be turned into real money."

The company also offers Square Register, which is a point-of-sale system that provides digital receipts, analytics, feedback, sales reports and manages inventory. Square promotes its products as one cohesive service to run an entire business by turning mobile devices into registers, providing analytics through any computer, as well as offering small business financing and marketing tools.Square derives the majority of its revenue from sales in the United States, although it has a growing customer base in Canada and Japan. Its sellers range from individual venders to multinational organizations, and its products can easily scale as a business grows.In the 12 months ended September 30, 2015, Square processed $32.4 billion in gross payment volume (GPV) through 638 million card payments made from approximately 180 million payment cards. Square generates revenue as a percentage of the GPV, and the company noted that in the same period, over two million sellers accepted five or more payments through Square, which represented approximately 97 percent of its GPV.The company also offers Square Capital, which is a financial service that extends cash advances to sellers. Currently, Square Capital has advanced over $300 million through 50,000 advances, and the company expects this business to grow significantly. Square Customer Engagement offers sellers tools to utilize feedback sent through digital receipts.Square devices accept the latest technology in payment methods, including EMV and NFC, which enables payment through Apple Pay and Android.The company had $850 million in revenue last year. Revenue for the first half of this year was $560.6 million, an increase of 51 percent over the same period last year. However, the company had a net loss of $154.1 million in 2014, and a loss of $77.6 million for the first half of 2015 and has warned that it may continue to generate losses in the near future.Executive Management HighlightsJack Dorsey co-founded Square in February 2009, and he serves as President, CEO and Chairman. He is also a co-founder of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and has served as its CEO since September 2015. He has been a director of Twitter since 2007 and an independent director of The Walt Disney Company since 2013.

3696136,22148,2015-11-18T14:15:05-05:00,Square is expected to price the highly-anticipated IPO after the close.Investors are incorrectly looking at valuation based on the price cut from the last private funding.The stock isn't attractive considering the relatively high valuation for a highly unprofitable payments processor.,"The IPO market has offered limited positive outcomes for investors over the last couple of years. Anybody trying to buy and hold a stock that is priced above the original range and rallied on the initial open hasn't seen gains. The only positive outcome with most IPOs was for investors in the public markets to flip the stock in the first few months.The Square (NYSE:SQ) IPO brings a unique situation to the normal equation of recent IPOs. The originally hot company has cooled off significantly prior to the IPO.The mobile payments service provider set the initial terms roughly 30% below the previous fund raising. The price range of $11 to $13 hasn't rose at this point, suggesting investors in the after-market might actually get access to the stock at prices relatively close to the original price terms set by the company and bookrunners.The question though is whether this price is still worthy of investing. According to the details, the company has a value of $4.4 billion at the proposed midpoint of the offering that includes 25.6 million shares sold by Square and only shareholders unloading 1.35 million shares.In the last 12 months, Square processed $32.4 billion of gross payment volumes (GPV) with over two million customers that accepted at least five payments. At the same time, the company uses Square Capital to advance over $300 million of advances to businesses that use the payments service where the company already has solid insight into the business fundamentals.The issue of valuing Square is that a big part of revenue comes from an exclusive agreement with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) that expires in Q3'16. The two parties recently agreed to an amended agreement that allows Starbucks to transition to another payments processor starting on October 1 with the expectations that the coffee retailer will end the relationship with Square prior to the original termination date.Due to the Starbucks issues, an investor needs to value the payments processor based on excluding that revenue. For the first nine months ended September 30, SQ generated revenues of $317.6 million on an adjusted basis. Revenue is growing fast at a 63% growth rate, but the amounts also exclude transaction costs.According to the financials listed below, Starbucks' transaction revenue was only $95.2 million for the first nine months of the year. Total net revenue was closer to $797 million, but the gross profit rises due to the Starbucks business operating at a $23.4 million gross loss.Source: Square S-1The biggest issue with Square is that operating expenses far exceed the gross profit of $260.9 million or closer to $284.3 million without Starbucks. With operating expenses of $387.6 million and stock-based expenses of $49.5 million, the cash expenses are $338.1 million.Either way, the valuation actually appears stretched at $4.4 billion. Using adjusted revenue, the company will trade at roughly 10x revenue, similar to Visa (NYSE:V) or MasterCard (NYSE:MA). The biggest issue in this scenario is that Square lacks the profits of those payments processors and is actually EBITDA negative for 2015 so far.Using gross revenues that include the transaction costs similar to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), the revenue total of roughly $1 billion when excluding Starbucks sets Square up for a valuation of over 4x revenues. PayPal trades at a similar multiple, but again the company is highly profitable in comparison to Square.The recommendation is that investors not chase the Square IPO. The cut in the valuation from the last private funding only brings the company back into line with other industry players that are extremely profitable. The market won't like paying market values for an unprofitable company and especially one with a part-time CEO in Jack Dorsey.The Square IPO is not a buy unless the stock dips below $10 despite the growth rates."

In every transaction, SQ sees opportunity for its sellers: to learn more about which products are selling best, to reinvest in their businesses, or to create and engage loyal buyers.Red flagsThe busted Starbucks deal cost SQ heavy losses and misdirection of management resources.Its competition includes Apple Pay, Android Pay, PayPal and others.Revenue from payments and point-of-sale servicesAlthough SQ currently generates approximately 95% of its revenue from payments and point-of-sale (POS) services, which includes the impact of revenue generated from Starbucks, the company has extended its product and service offerings to include financial services and marketing services, all to help sellers start, run, and grow their businesses.SQ works to democratize commerce-leveling the playing field for sellers of all sizes.The company's focus on technology and design allows it to create products and services that are accessible, intuitive, and easy-to-use. SQ sets attractive and transparent pricing, and it accepts approximately 95% of sellers who seek to process payments with Square.SQ provides a free software app with its affordable (often free) hardware to turn mobile devices into powerful POS solutions in minutes. The company's insights into its sellers' businesses have allowed SQ to develop services that are applicable to businesses of all types and sizes, from Square Analytics to digital receipts.SQ also continues to add advanced software features that tailor its POS solution to specific types of sellers, such as open tickets for bars and restaurants and inventory management for retailers.Because of its approach, SQ has grown rapidly. Millions of sellers accept payments with Square. These span all types of businesses, from cabs to coffee shops, lawyers to landscapers, retail stores to restaurants.Although substantially all of its revenue is currently generated in the United States, Square also serves sellers throughout Canada and Japan.As this international base of sellers grows, so too should its Gross Payment Volume (GPV) and revenue in these regions.The company serves sellers of all sizes, ranging from a single vendor at a farmers' market to multinational businesses. Its products and services are built to scale, so sellers can stay with SQ over the life of their businesses.GPV (Gross Purchase Volume)In the 12 months ended September 30, 2015, sellers using Square processed $32.4 billion of GPV, which was generated by 638 million card payments from approximately 180 million payment cards.GPV measures the total dollar amount of card payment transactions the company processes for its sellers (net of refunds), excluding card payments processed for Starbucks and SQ's Square Cash peer-to-peer service. Since it generates transaction revenue as a percentage of payment volume, SQ believes GPV is a key indicator of its ability to generate revenue.In the 12 months ended September 30, 2015, over two million sellers accepted five or more payments using Square, accounting for approximately 97% of the company's GPV.Intellectual propertyAs of September 30, 2015, SQ had 113 issued patents and 460 filed patent applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions relating to a variety of aspects of its technology. The company's issued patents will expire between 2022 and 2034 (with the exception of a single patent obtained through an acquisition, which will expire in 2016).CompetitionFor payments and POS services, SQ competes primarily with traditional acquiring processors and payment processors who sell more expensive POS systems, often bundled with long-term contracts, through direct sales and ISO channels.While competitive factors and their relative importance vary based on the size, industry, and focus of sellers, SQ believes these principal methods of competition in the market for payments and POS services are the following:Square's competitors range from large, well-established vendors to smaller, earlier-stage companies, including third-party acquiring processors or payment processors, POS software and terminal providers, peer-to-peer payment providers, and business software providers such as those that provide ecommerce, inventory management, analytics, and appointment solutions.The company seeks to differentiate itself from competitors primarily on the basis of its cohesive commerce ecosystem and focus on accessibility, speed, transparency, and trust. SQ's ability to innovate quickly to accept new payment technologies such as NFC through Apple Pay, Android Pay, and other new currencies further differentiates its payment platform from the competition.5% shareholders pre-IPODividendsNo dividends are planned.Use of proceedsSQ expects to receive $285 million from its IPO and use it for the following:Disclaimer: This SQ IPO report is based on a reading and analysis of SQ's S-1 filing, which can be found here, and a separate, independent analysis by IPOdesktop.com.

3667836,52712,2015-11-09T15:25:49-05:00,Square generates negative free cash flow and is unprofitable.Starbucks transaction processing was a large revenue stream with no clear way to replace it.Competition in the sector is intense and growing.Company processes a lot of secure data and may be subject to data security issues and/or hacks.,"Square (Pending:SQ) recently filed to go public. Square has grown their revenue substantially over the past few years, but we feel there are major risks to this stock, which we will further elaborate on. One of the core risks to Square is the online payments processing sector is very competitive with limited barriers to entry. Additionally, Square was heavily dependent on Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) for a large percentage of its revenue, with Starbucks now switching to another payment service provider. Finally Square is not profitable and has a negative free cash flow profile and is not expected to generate substantial free cash flow going forward. We do not see online payments as a winner take all space like an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (e-commerce), and thus do not feel comfortable paying for negative cash flows for years as an investor.The payments and POS market is extremely competitive. Numerous companies operate in this sector and offer similar products. Running a Google search for POS software (see below), many product offerings were found with similar or lower price points. Square acknowledges Google traffic as a major source of leads for their business and traffic from this source is likely to be increasingly competitive to acquire, as Square's competitors secure more funding. Square lists 17 competitors on their crunchbase profile, but there are many more, with even more likely to emerge given the increased interest in financial technology start-ups.Source: Author Analysis/GoogleOne major competitor to Square is Paypal. PayPal recently released PayPal Here, which looks identical to Squares hardware(see below). PayPal Here allows businesses to process payments with a mobile card reader or chip card reader. The company also has a similar business model to Square, charging a transaction fee based on the amount processed. The fact that PayPal can offer a nearly identical product to Square and not be shut down in light of lawsuits is evidence that the 113 issued patents Square has are likely to not be material barriers to entry.Source: PayPal WebsiteAdditionally, there has been little discussion of the fact that Starbucks the company's largest customer, generating 14% of the businesses revenue in 2014 is switching to another payment processor. We see this as a major concern and may be a signal that this is increasingly a price driven, commodity oriented business and that Square may never be a business which is able to generate attractive margins.Square is also not profitable and has generated negative cash flow historically (see below). We do not view the online payments business as one with inherent network effects, evidenced by Starbucks ability to change their payment processing provider with little notice. From a valuation perspective this also makes this stock very difficult to value from a cash flow perspective with little ability to predict their cash flows and the consistency of their cash flows.Source: Author Analysis/Historical FinancialsDespite being a play on small business growth within the United States and the scale Square has achieved, we advise investors to wait on the sidelines for Square's IPO. Although many times there are IPO pops, we see little fundamental reasons to own the stock at this time. Given the numerous technology investments available, we advise investors to look for other high growth businesses without these core risk factors."
3662906,61281,2015-11-08T13:04:30-05:00,"Square significantly discounted its IPO compared to its series E price.Discount reasons include concerns about private market valuations, competition, increasing losses, and Dorsey’s leadership.The investment thesis for Square IPO is only slightly changed.","Last Friday, mobile payment company Square (NYSE:SQ) priced its IPO at a midpoint price of $12 and set the IPO size at 25.6M units, reflecting a market cap of almost $4B. Square's offering is substantially lower than the IPO pricing scenarios I discussed in an earlier article and was driven by the company's preferred stock prices sold at previous private placements, upside potential, valuation compared to the competition, and mobile payments market dynamics. Does the massive discount make Square IPO more attractive?As shown in Chart 1 below, Square's IPO mid-range price offers a huge 22% discount on its Series E stock price and its valuation drops from $6B to $4B.There are a number of things that could drive Square's underwriters to offer such a substantial discount on its stock price. The first reason is an outcome from the company's presentations to potential investors that might indicate only a modest interest in the IPO either because they don't think valuation is right or because they don't think they will be able to sell it for an adequate return. While valuations are very subjective and include too many variables to challenge the decision, I can understand if institutional investors fear that they won't be able to gain significantly from selling Square's shares. That brings me to the second reason for the discount.Steep private market valuations, together with failing IPOs and the Theranos scandal, can drive retail and institutional investors away from a high profile unicorn IPO. The general concern about tech unicorns pushes investors to look for earnings and to settle only for top-line growth.Looking at Square's growth trend unveils a troubling picture for investors looking for a profitable company or one that is decreasing its losses. As shown in Chart 2 below, the company's total net revenues and adjusted revenues (without the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) deal and transaction costs) increase YoY at impressive rates. However, the company's bottom-line worsens every year. The same picture is also reflected in the quarterly financials. This type of trend is not very appealing when talking about a company that leads a particular market for a few years.The third reason for offering a discounted price is Square's relationship with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and the fact that Mr. Dorsey is managing both companies. Dorsey is the primary person the market is looking at to turn Twitter around, a job that probably takes most of his time and focus. Regardless of how talented Mr. Dorsey might be, I'm not sure investors are satisfied when a CEO in a company they own shares in spends more time managing another company. This model naturally drives investors away from Square's IPO.The fourth reason to lower the IPO price is the increasing competition from rising players such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) Pay, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android Pay, and existing players like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Payments, and many other startups. Underwriters need to make Square's investment more appealing than the other opportunities.Does the massive discount make the Square IPO more attractive?I will answer this question in regard to retail investors. When Square and its underwriters lower the initial IPO price range, it means that institutional investors will buy the shares at a significant discount and sell them to retail investors or smaller institutional players for a much higher price. Under this mechanism, retail investors will probably be able to buy Square's shares at a much higher price that is slightly above the series E price. In my previous Square IPO article, I set a reasonable mid-point price at $19 which is 20% above series E price and now appears as 55% above the initial IPO mid-point price. I still believe this price is reasonable; however, it should be the maximum price investors should pay for Square.As I outlined in an earlier article about the dynamics of the mobile payment market, I believe increased competition will drive a consolidation process where the tech giants purchase the smaller pure-play competitors. In this M&A wave, Square is probably one of the preferred acquisition targets. However, this might not be until several years from now. Investors interested in this high-risk IPO should allocate a small percentage of their portfolio for this event so it will not impact severely if it flops. However, it will gain excellent profits in the case of an acquisition."
3680496,61281,2015-11-12T14:36:35-05:00,"A change in sentiment towards tech unicorns is occurring.Uber's unbelievable P/S ratio, the Snapchat and Dropbox reevaluations, and the challenges to the Theranos model are symptoms.Square's IPO is a test for the unicorn model and will shape the IPO market of 2016.","Source: HMS Insurance and financial servicesStraight out of Greek mythology, unicorns swarmed into our lives a few years ago aiming to change different aspects of our everyday lives: from taking a cab and instant messaging a friend to finding affordable lodging abroad. These unicorns are privately held startups worth more than $1B, according to the description by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, who coined the phrase in a TechCrunch blog post in 2013. At the beginning, there were just a few unicorns; however, as consumer technology boomed in recent years with the emergence of many new smart devices (tablets, smartphones, smart watches, smart TVs, etc.), supported by an incredible network of behind-the-scenes applications, more opportunities were created for startups to evolve at a rapid pace. In 2013, there were 39 unicorns (mentioned in Aileen Lee's original post), and now there are 125, according to WSJ's Billion Dollar Startup Club.In the normal life cycle of a startup company, one of the first stages is to raise money to fund the company's activities before it is able to generate enough money on its own. This is a healthy procedure in which the startup receives funding to materialize its initial idea, and the investment firm receives an equity stake in a company that could be worth millions in the future. However, this healthy mechanism started to crack as bigger companies looked for bigger funding and more investors entered the private equity markets.There is a fundamental difference between an early investment in small startup seeking to raise a few million to develop a prototype or expand globally and a billion-dollar investment in a giant technology firm. When looking to invest in an early-stage startup, all you are interested in is whether the idea is feasible and if customers will be willing to purchase the final product/service. If the answer to both of these questions is yes, then the startup might be able to drive sales, and it might have a growth potential. However, when investing in a giant technology firm, the potential should already be proven, and you are looking to see whether this potential could be expanded to other markets and other geographies and whether this business could be profitable sometime in the future. These are two totally different aspects of investing. When the first type of question is applied to the second type of company (tech giants), there is a good chance that something will go bad at the end.The leaked document with Uber's (NYSE:UBER) financial information unveils some of the problems of the current valuations in the private market when compared to other companies of similar size. As shown in the table below, even though Uber was valued at $51B, it generates less revenue than other prominent tech companies such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), EMC (EMC), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).Source: Thomson ReutersOther non-tech companies that are evaluated roughly like Uber include great companies like General Motors (NYSE:GM), Mizuho (NYSE:MFG), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), Teva (NYSE:TEVA), Ford (NYSE:F), Metlife (NYSE:MET), and many others that are valued very closely to Uber but generate significantly more revenue than Uber. That is a direct result of applying small startup measurements to big tech companies. All the companies listed in the table and in this paragraph are leaders in their respective markets with steady revenue streams and strong balance sheets that have already hit or are planning to hit breakeven profitability. Uber is not there yet-so why was it valued so high?Uber is not the only problem in private market valuations, but it's a symptom of a market failure that is starting to unfold now. After a six-year bull market on the public markets, investors have become more careful for many reasons and question the valuation of many companies compared with their profitability and growth potential. This cautious slow move to the private market has investors like Fidelity and BlackRock reevaluating their Snapchat (CHAT) and Dropbox investments.There are many examples of the change in the market sentiment toward the unicorns. The Wall Street Journal (link requires subscription) challenged Theranos' entire business model by claiming the company uses its proprietary equipment to diagnose only a small portion of the blood tests it covers, and to analyze the other tests, the company dilutes blood samples and compromises test validity. Fidelity dropped its Snapchat investment valuation by 25 percent while BlackRock dropped its Dropbox investment valuation by 31 percent, advising the company to halt its IPO plans. Storage company Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) went public and is currently traded in similar valuation to its series F funding round, which means that investors like T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), Tiger Global, and Index Ventures yielded a minuscule return on their investments. Another unicorn, Box (NYSE:BOX) lost more than 40 percent of its value since it went public, trading below its IPO price and driving the reevaluation of its rival, Dropbox.I believe this is the beginning of a trend to bring private tech valuations back to Earth while investors look beyond growth potential and also look for sustainable growth, the path for profitability, and proven revenue generation. Square's (NYSE:SQ) IPO is the next big test for the entire unicorn valuation model. Currently, the Square IPO is valuated 30 percent lower than its latest series-E funding round, and the associated risks with this IPO (described here and here) together with the marginal financials could easily drive investors away.The outcome of a Square IPO will shape how the IPO market of 2016 will look. Failure or success of this IPO will determine a lot for tech unicorns like Lyft, Uber, Dropbox, Snapchat, and Airbnb (AIRB), which are uncertain about whether they should go public."
3581676,61281,2015-10-19T08:23:35-04:00,"$6B unicorn Square filed for IPO.Square grows at an 80% CAGR, but faces growth headwinds as competition intensifies.The company ramps up new services to compensate for the revenues lost after ending the Starbucks deal.Increased competition might make Square an attractive acquisition target.","Mobile payments service provider Square (NYSE:SQ) filed its S-1 with the SEC last week, seeking to raise $275M. The company previously has raised $590M in the private market over the last six years since its inception. The long-awaited Square IPO brings one of the hottest tech unicorns to the public equity market at a delicate time for the company.Square's deal with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is ending, and the company is starting to ramp up new paid services to compensate for the lost revenues. The mobile payments market is experiencing increased competition from new and big players like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), which are expected to gain substantial market share from the smaller ones. In light of this business environment, is Square an attractive investment?Business ModelSquare was founded in 2009 with a revolutionary idea to transform every mobile device into a point-of-sale (POS) with a simple dongle. Square offered simple infrastructure, low transaction fees, and an easy-to-use solution that attracted many small and medium businesses. Square enabled cash-only, local businesses, such as food trucks, beauty parlors, and restaurants, to also accept credit cards. With time, the company expanded its offering to other adjacent information and financial services, which merchants require to maintain their businesses, from data analytics to capital funding services.Square translates all its information and financial services into three main revenue streams:As shown in Chart 1 below, the transaction revenue stream accounted for almost 99% of the company's revenues in 2014, which is expected to decrease to 95% in 2015, when the software and data product segment is expected to grow 3x and account for almost 4% of the company's revenues.Square's annual revenues increased 77% CAGR. Gross margin is between 26% and 32%, which reflects a substantial money-generating business. However, these growth numbers, margins, and total net revenue figures unveil a misleading picture. The Starbucks revenues are not relevant for new investors, as they will be eliminated soon, and a large portion of the transaction revenues are used to pay Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and other financial institutes for processing the credit/debit cards payments.As shown in Chart 2 below, removing the Starbucks deal revenues and transaction costs shaves almost 65% of Square's revenues and, for example, sets 2014 revenues on $276M vs. $850M in the previous calculation.Adjusted revenues reflect the correct revenue trend investors should refer to when analyzing Square's financials and assessing IPO investment. Under the adjusted revenues, the 4-year CAGR slightly improved to 80%, and the company drops significantly below the $1 billion revenue threshold.Growth DriversTo compensate for the revenue lost from ending the Starbucks deal, Square develops and invests further in the software and product data segment. The company's leading service in this segment is Square Capital, which provides pre-qualified merchant cash advances to better fund their operations. Square proactively approaches merchants based on their transaction histories and offers them cash advances that are repaid in future payments according to the merchant processing volume. In the 18 months that Square operated this service, it paid $225M in cash advances that will be repaid in the future.To help drive recurring purchases and increase customer engagement, Square provides CRM software for its customers in a freemium model. Square's CRM (named Square Customer Engagement) allows merchants to engage actively with their customers, offering them special deals and promotions with a feedback tool and customer insight analytics capabilities. As other SMB software services platforms like Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) presented, CRM could be a powerful tool to increase customer engagement, and it offers plenty of room for continuous developments and improvements that could benefit Square's users.Another element that Square targets as a growth driver is strengthening its partnership with local businesses. As shown in Chart 3 below, most of Square's gross purchases volume (GPV) is generated by small businesses, and by strengthening partnerships with these businesses, Square could create long-term relationships that could benefit both parties. One of the initiatives to improve local business partnerships is based on Square's Caviar acquisition. Caviar allows local restaurants in 15 large markets across the U.S. to offer food deliveries for their customers in a fully outsourced model. Since Square acquired Caviar in August 2014, the service has handled a volume 3x higher and an increased headcount of 2x more to support that growth. As mentioned above, Caviar is not yet available nationwide, but the additional headcount will be handling that task. As shown in Chart 3, food-related businesses accounted for 15% of Square's GPV, and it's the third-largest industry driving Square's GPV. Caviar's delivery-as-a-service model is expected to drive more sales for local restaurants and increase Square's penetration in the restaurant sector.As shown in Chart 1 above, 84% of Square's revenues are generated in transaction fees and directly impacted from the company's GPV. In its S-1, Square presents information from the Nilson Report that shows that the U.S. economy is rapidly increasing the purchasing volume made through credit cards. According to the Nilson Report, the total card payment volume is expected to grow to $10T in 2023 from the $6T currently processed. This expected rise should drive an organic increase in Square's revenues solely from the increased card payment volume.CompetitionThe mobile payments market, where Square is competing, is flooded with competitors from small startups to deep-pocket tech giants and all are interested in grabbing a share of the $10T GPV market. The first group of competitors is the pure-play payment processing companies like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Here, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) GoPayment, Verifone (NYSE:PAY) Payware and others that offer similar card-sweeping and complementary services suite. The second group includes e-commerce platforms that operate a card-processing service for in-person transactions like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Register and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Direct Checkout to support a wider range of sales opportunities for merchants and include both online and in-person transactions. The third group is relatively new and includes mobile payments service by leading technology companies like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google's Android Pay that strive to use the broad eco-system each one of these player has and allow their users implement mobile payment into these eco-systems.All competitors use similar NFC solutions and provide high-quality business management platform to support the payment service. As the market is so crowded right now, the only companies to benefit are Visa and MasterCard, which process the vast majority of the payments for a significant take rate that drives transaction costs up and net revenues significantly down for players in the market. The current market structure, where there are no key leaders, drives inefficient transaction costs paid to Visa and MasterCard.In this current market status, the mobile payments market is not an attractive place for a small player like Square. I believe that in the long run, major players, like Apple, Google, or Samsung, will have to acquire the small dominant players to gain more market share and generate additional revenue from transaction fees. That means that companies like Square, Stripe, Dwolla, and even PayPal are legitimate acquisition targets by these giants, who will drive a significant consolidation process in the market.RisksThe intense competition and crowded market can have a direct impact on the company's finances and are high-priority risks investors should consider. On top of these risks, there are additional risks that Square's investors should take into consideration:Private PlacementsSquare raised almost $600M in 9 equity and debt financing rounds between November 2009 and October 2014. Early investors in Square include venture capital funds like Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Tiger Technology Global Management, as well as financial institutions such as Visa and Citi Ventures. As shown in Chart 4 below, Square's valuation increased to $6B in its latest funding round.Square's latest $6B valuation reflects a P/S ratio of 5.7 with TTM net revenues of $1.03B and a P/S ratio of 17.8 with TTM adjusted revenues of $337M. Assuming Series E investors expect at least a 20% upside on their investment it will drive an IPO share price of $18.5 which reflects a valuation of $7.2B, net revenues P/S of 7 and adjusted revenues P/S of 21.5. Assuming Square is a growth company in an ultra-growing sector, these multiples are not too high. However, the buzz and hype around the IPO could drive share price and valuation higher and push multiples much higher.Looking at the competition, Amazon has a P/S of 2.75, PayPal has 4.9, Etsy has 5.27, Intuit has 6.11m and Verifone has 1.77. Square might be on par with some of these companies (on net revenues basis), but they have a different core business that generate most of their revenues while they offer on par payment processing services. This adds to the pressure to grow rapidly that Square has on top of the risks mentioned above.ConclusionMobile payments company Square filed for an IPO last week. The company is one of many mobile processing service providers that enable merchants to accept cards payments in in-person transactions and later analyze their sales using Square SW tools. Square generates the vast majority of its revenue from transaction fees, while trying to develop a sustainable SW/data product segment to generate additional revenue and reduce the company's dependency on continuous GPV increases.With the Starbucks deal over and the software/data products segment not yet fully ramped, Square will experience a few very difficult years until this segment is more significant in the revenues mix. On top of that, Square will have to drive higher revenue from Caviar and see some results from its local businesses, focusing on maintaining a sustainable business that keeps up with the competition.As deep-pocket tech giants Apple, Google, and Samsung penetrated the already-crowded market, smaller players are expected to experience the impact. However, the large number of players prevents competitors, including the tech giants, from gaining substantial market share and generating significant revenue. That status could only be resolved once the tech giants feel the pressure to increase market share and revenue and will result in a consolidation in the market. Square will probably be one of the targets to be acquired; however, this might not be until several years from now.For long-term investors, I believe that a price range between $18 and $20, which reflects a P/S ratio of 6.9 to 7.35 (on a net revenue basis), could present a reasonable entry point. This price range reflects a 20% to 27% upside for series E investors and a market value of $7.2B to $7.6B to Square. However, as we saw in the recent Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) IPO, investors might be able to buy Square's shares for a more attractive price on the debut day. The hype and buzz around the company as well as the positive and flattering media coverage of the company and Jack Dorsey could drive the Square share price sharply up in the short-term, to the benefit of investors. In the long-term, Square must either succeed to grow its business significantly or be acquired by one of the current tech giants in the market or by a new player that wants to penetrate the market.As this is a high-risk investment in a growing market, I would allocate only a small percentage of my portfolio to Square, so that it will not hurt too much if it tanks, yet it could benefit from a nice return in the case of its acquisition. In the meantime, I believe Square investors could benefit from a moderate upside.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3624936,69265,2015-10-30T05:32:18-04:00,,"Square (NYSE:SQ) is losing money. Like, mad money.The mobile payments company is planning to go public, and filed IPO (initial public offering) documents last week, giving people a chance to comb through its financials - and on first glance…it doesn't look great.The company competes with other shops like Venmo and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in the money-transfer game - which means they will have to up their game if they want to stay competitive.Let's dig in a bit further, though. When a company goes through the process of becoming a public company, they have to submit an S1 filing, which contains its basic business and financial information. This is where we'll find our answers.In the 6 months ending June 30, 2015, Square pulled in revenues of $560 million. Not only is that an impressive number without any context, but it also represents a 50% increase from the first 6 months of 2014.Not bad.Except that for the same time period, Square recorded a net loss of almost $80 million.Yikes.If Square were to replicate its first half of the year, then that would mean it pulled in over a billion dollars in revenue and still lost more than $150 million! $150 million is no chump change; for that money, you could pay for a private company to send you to the moon…and back.However, before we call it case closed and walk away, let's dig in further. There's a metric that's always included in the S1: the EBITDA.If you're familiar with financial statements, you'll know that the EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. If you're not…well, now you know too.The EBITDA tells us what a company earns less its expenses, excluding super annoying things like taxes or amortization.Ultimately, the EBITDA allows companies to reflect what they think is the ""true"" profitability of the company, because it allows for greater discretion as to what's included in the final calculation than a straight profit-loss number.You have to be careful, though - because while some items can justifiably be excluded via the EBITDA, others may not necessarily be as justified. You really have to look at everything. With a company that's going public and looking to raise money, it's not hard to imagine why it would be in someone's best interest to dress the numbers up.Square is removing things like stock-based compensation (an expense that must stand, but as Square argues, does not reflect the true health of their core business). Can you see how it's a bit of a grey area? Compensation is a responsibility the company holds towards its employees, but for a company that is not yet public, stock-based compensation is something that won't ultimately be realized until after they go public.There is one notable exclusion. In its EBITDA, Square is taking out all of the costs associated with its Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) partnership. In a nutshell, Square loses money on every transaction that takes place at a Starbucks that is using its technology. Square makes money on all other transactions in other businesses it associates with.What makes one business different from another? Why is it that Square can exclude one business on the basis that they are losing money with them and make out like their business is doing just fine?It's like if you owned a car dealership and had sold one car all month. Not a great month, but if you exclude all the cars you didn't sell then…hey, you sold 100% of your cars. Great job!Their reasoning is that the deal with Starbucks ends in Q3 2016 - so again, the numbers don't fully reflect the health of the main business.The exclusions allowed Square to shrink their overall loss to $19 million when compared to the $80 million mentioned earlier. When you look at the number for the most recent quarter, Square's actually reporting a slight profit.Pretty nifty trick, hey?While it's true that Square will not be losing money on Starbucks transactions one year from now, it's still losing money today, right now, right this second. But as with all things, you be the judge. What do you think?The reality is that while EBITDA is a good metric to look at to evaluate a company's profitability, it isn't good at evaluating cash flow. That you have to look at separately, while making sure that a company isn't trying to hide something with its EBITDA.So how is its cash flow then?Square allows a shop owner to accept payments via a mobile phone or credit card and the Square reader. In return, the company takes a cut of the transaction (around 3-4%). As Square reports in its S1, 95% of its revenue comes from payments and it's been consistently growing for the last few years.In 2012, the company brought in $200 million, which grew to $550 million in 2013 and in 2014 Square brought in a massive $850 million in total revenue. That's good news. Square is consistently growing the business, even if actually making a profit has so far been beyond the company.So Square's latest move - filing for an IPO - likely indicates that they are looking for more money to stay afloat as they continue to hemorrhage dollars. It's a strategy that's been employed by other companies in the past. Paypal would likely not be where it is now, an $8 billion+ company, were it not for the deep pockets of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). The risk is that Square won't be able to gain enough of a toehold before operations have to be aborted.The company is precipitously balanced and it may be that going public is its Hail Mary pass. It is telling Daniele Morrill, founder of Mattermark, believes that Square could not raise money on the private market at a price it was happy with and therefore is going the public route."

(NYSE:SQ) just filed the necessary documents to take the company public.After navigating a deal gone sour with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), this could give the payment systems startup the confidence boost it needs to once again make a push for profitability.Square is one of those billion dollar unicorn startups that are so unique to Silicon Valley. It still makes 95% of its revenue from processing payments, according to Inc.com. Investors have been willing to throw millions of dollars at it at a time. But unfortunately, the current state of its finances will probably remain secret until it is forced to show its hand to stockholders.However, Inc. goes on to claim that Square burns two-thirds of every dollar it makes in running the business. The site doesn't source its claim, and they are hard to verify. But that speculation alone will be enough to make many investors think twice.The deal is being courted by Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Jefferies. The IPO could happen around the end of the year. It hopes to raise $275 million with the deal.Who is Square?Square is the hero of the small business and startup payment system. The company's mission is to simplify commerce by allowing businesses of any size to take more methods of payment.Square does not require customers to purchase or lease expensive equipment like the weboost drive 4g-x. It also does not lock anyone into an iron clad contract.Square believes that everyone should be able to accept credit cards as a form of payment. As such, its Register operates through common devices like iPhones, iPads, and Android devices.An Easy InvestmentSquare was co-founded by Jack Dorsey, a Silicon Valley staple. Not only did he co-found Square but he is also the co-founder and current CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). He also serves on the board at The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Dorsey is a capable CEO with plenty of experience and resources.Customers can rely on Square's payment systems. A startup like Square does not just land a deal to process every Starbucks payment by being innovative. It also has to be robust, secure and reliable. The Starbucks deal struck several years ago demonstrated serious confidence in Square's potential even as a young startup.The loss of the Starbucks deal is actually a good thing for Square. Square reportedly lost over $56 million on implementing the deal. Square says that when it is free from processing Starbucks transactions, it can focus more on its gross profit. The company loses money when it processes Starbucks transactions. It makes money when it processes payments for any other business.The papers released by Square show that its payments systems, which makes up most of its business, are growing quickly. In the first half of the year, Square brought in $560 million. This is a 51% increase compared to 2014. This means that it will not just survive the breakup with Starbucks, it can thrive as a result of it.Reasons to AvoidThere are major concerns regarding Square's CEO, Jack Dorsey. Dorsey is currently splitting his time between Square and Twitter. Many people are concerned about how much time will be dedicated to Square when Dorsey is in such a focused state at Twitter.Many fear that Dorsey will not be focused enough to guide Square through its IPO. The company has not yet laid out any official plans for how it intends to share its chief executive.The Starbucks deal is going to hang over the company throughout the process of going public. This may result in negative press but overall, should not impact the IPO too much as long as investors remember that processing all of Starbucks payments was never going to be Square's main business.The IPO feels rushed. Christmas is not a good time to go public historically. The partners behind the scenes are aware of this. This makes the deal seem like it is being rushed for a reason that is so far undisclosed.The Bottom LineDespite the bitter taste that Starbucks might leave, Square is a good buy. The Starbucks deal demonstrated that Square can successfully take on huge accounts in addition to small businesses, which demonstrates its virility in the diverse marketplace.Investors should not read the dissolution of the deal negatively; the Square was just cutting ties with a deal that did not make them any money. Although the breakup is public, it puts the company in a positive position to move forward with a successful IPO. Square is beloved by the marketplace and without Starbucks holding it back, it will have a brilliant future as a public company."
3580536,66213,2015-10-18T20:56:15-04:00,"Square is growing at an incredible pace.The company will face intense competition trying to capture larger clients.With poor operating margins and a recent failed partnership with Starbucks, there are better options for investors.","Square (NYSE:SQ) is a payment processing company tailored to the needs of small businesses. It has grown at an incredible pace and offers 6 different services: Square Register, Capital, Cash, Payroll, Customer Engagement, and Caviar. Although in a huge growth phase, Square is also hit with consistent net losses since its inception. Now, 5 years after the original app launched, Square has filed for an IPO. Below are 5 reasons I'm not interested in the Square IPO:The Company Has A Part-Time CEOThe emphasis on Square's executive team is on its CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey, better known as the co-founder and CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). According to Square's prospectus:Both Twitter and Square are unprofitable companies that need the full attention of their CEO. I'm sure he will divide his time and energy between the two companies; however, I am not confident that he will divide them evenly, with Square taking a backseat.It's Not Even Close To Turning A ProfitRevenue for 2014 rose an impressive 54%, but net loss also increased by 47%. Square is going to need to make significant changes to turn a profit, and I don't see any operational or pricing strategy set in motion to do so. I believe the company is going to try to run its valuation on sales growth - always a dangerous move. Normally, I would have thought a company like this would lean out for a profit and seek an acquisition; however, I think the IPO proceeds are likely to be spent on Square furthering sales, while increasing or maintaining losses.Source: Square's S-1No Need To Get Excited, Because Square Might Withdraw Its IPOAs we saw from Albertsons (NYSE:ABS) and Neiman Marcus (NMG) postponing their IPOs due to market volatility, I wouldn't be surprised if Square does the same when the time comes. What is also important to understand is that Square does not need an IPO. Although the company can't turn a profit, it has a current ratio of 1.6 and a cash ratio of 0.7. There is no pressure on this company to raise immediate capital for operational needs. Something tells me the capital it raises might be put toward capital expenditures, which the company claims it has nothing in motion for yet.Its Growth May Not Be SustainableSquare can keep taking losses to grow revenue, but that is going to catch up to the company when it moves up to grabbing larger companies as clients. Right now, Square's products are great for small businesses; however, small businesses don't produce the volume of larger businesses, and are less sustainable. Partnering with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in 2012 was Square's big move to solidify itself as a legitimate payment processor for large companies. Unfortunately, the partnership proved unsuccessful, leading to more than $48 million in losses. Starbucks will be changing to a new payment processor in 2016, which brings about the concern of competition.While Square might be fixing a problem for small businesses, there are already heavy hitters in the payment processing industry, with the biggest of them, First Data (FDC), recently going public. Gaining market share of large companies is extremely competitive, costly, and risky. Personally, I'd be more excited if I thought the company would remain dedicated solely to small businesses, as its other services, Square Capital and Square Payroll, are tailored specifically to that market segment.The Company Is Not Worth $6 BillionGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) is showing high-single digit revenue growth and double-digit net income growth, and trades at a P/S ratio of 3.1. Vantiv (VNTV) is seeing consistent double-digit revenue growth and huge 3-year net income growth, and trades at a P/S of 3.5. Square had revenue of $561 million for the first 6 months of 2015, and should be on track for $1.2 billion in revenue for the year. That would place its P/S at 5 - too high for my tolerance. I would rather invest my money in a company with a better sustainable customer base, which is already turning positive earnings at a lower valuation ratio.ConclusionMaybe Square is ""cool"" and ""techy"" enough to have a successful IPO, but I don't think this company is even ready for the public. It is still coming down from its failed partnership with Starbucks, and has enough money to sustain its operations. The sales growth is impressive, but too expensive. It is very difficult to value this company, because I believe it will remain in the red for the next 2-4 years; however, I'm positive it will hit the market much higher than I would pay."
3579206,67493,2015-10-16T17:20:47-04:00,"Square burst on to the start-up scene in 2010 with a good, perhaps even great, answer to an unmet need: how could small businesses accept payment by credit card?It has become clear that no matter how much the small-business segment has been a success, growing share with larger payers has been, all told, a failure.Square will be, once again, most entirely a small-business focused payment processor and that the company cannot make money serving enterprise clients.","Square (NYSE:SQ), the San Francisco-based upstart payments processor, is an intriguing company on a number of levels: for one, its CEO, Jack Dorsey, invented Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), has had numerous profiles appear in respected publications like The New Yorker and Wired, and has even been compared to his erstwhile idol, Steve Jobs. But aside from the ""Dorsey effect,"" Square has been ""through the ringer"" as a private company and is going public at an interesting time in its corporate evolution. All this piqued my interest so I decided to take a closer look at the company.Square burst on to the start-up scene in 2010 with a good, or perhaps even great, answer to an unmet need: how could small businesses (often mobile) accept payment by credit card? The original Square dongle - a small white appendage you plug into the headphone jack of an iPhone - immediately took off with small businesses across the US due its combination of form (sleek and sexy), functionality (easy to sign up and use) and cost (original dongles were given away free to build share, processing fees were and are set lower than the comp as well). The visual similarities, along with the innovative yet simple solution to a pressing need, initially drew the Jobs comparisons.Those comparisons were short-sighted, however, for a few reasons, but mostly because Steve Jobs would never sell a premium product at a discount to market - in fact he was famous for making the best possible product and letting consumers come to his product on his terms. Dorsey, of course, did not have this luxury: payment processing margins are so thin (around 1% net of each transaction, after paying fees to the credit cards, and before provisioning for operating costs) that he could not simply build the coolest product and hope the customer would show up at his door. Instead, he would need to seek out the customer (via loss-leading dongle giveaways), build scale, then hope to up-sell ancillary services (POS systems, invoice/receipt management, tax-related services, credit provision, etc) to build profitability later. Along the way, Square would hope to transition - or at least grow exposure to - much higher-volume enterprise (read: big business) users, since small businesses of course process many fewer transactions, are harder to scale (a new client win counts for relatively little) and are smaller targets for add-on upselling.Win share with low-value customers, build relevance, transition from low-value to high-value customers once demonstrating a value proposition, then make money - not a bad model, as far as it goes (except perhaps the part about starting with low-value customers). Of course, note that success is dependent not just on growing low-end share but also upon transitioning the offering up the value chain. The fundamental issue for Square today is that, four years in, it has become painfully clear that no matter how much the small-business segment has been a success, growing share with larger payers has been, all told, a failure - and it is thus extremely unclear whether the model will ever profitably scale. Square's experience with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a telling example.When Square first announced its deal (2012) to provide POS solutions and process all card transactions at Starbucks' 7,000-plus US outlets, it seemed like a massive win. Square was moving beyond small business and into the enterprise. It could push out ancillary products (Square Wallet, etc) to Starbucks users as well as hopefully to Starbucks corporate. And Starbucks even took an equity stake in the company.But fast forward just three years and Square's S-1 (pre-IPO) document depicts promising opportunity gone awry. Square cumulatively lost ~$80mm on Starbucks transaction processing alone (ie, not counting the operating expenses to support the business), while Starbucks has opted to move to another payments process from October this year. The problems were various: transaction volumes at Starbucks basically stopped growing this year - implying consumers simply didn't care to use the product - while Square was unable to up-sell ancillary products either to Starbucks customers (eg, the failure and eventual shut-down of Square Wallet, a Paypal/Venmo/Google Wallet competitor) or to the company. Subsequently, various articles have suggested Square only won the business back in 2012 by severely under-cutting the then-processor (Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)) on price - not exactly a sustainable way to profitably win new business.The financial implications as reported by Square also are troubling. In the IPO offering docs, Square takes the somewhat aggressive approach of removing all the Starbucks related business from their ""adjusted"" revenue and EBITDA metrics. This effectively treats the Starbucks experiment as a discontinued operation, which it is, given the service will stop from October this year. But the adjustment of Square's financial reporting to remove Starbucks numbers also gives the impression that this experiment - despite being ~15% of Square's total transaction revenues in 2014 and 1H 2015 - is immaterial to Square's ongoing operations and prospects, which I believe is severely misleading. After all, earlier in the S-1, Square proudly trotted out the below ""GPV"" (Gross Purchasing Volume, a measure of the dollar value of all transactions processed by Square) chart, suggesting a successful transition to larger merchants was an ongoing part of the Square growth story:Looking at the financials, it is clear that Starbucks represents most all of the "">$500k annualized GPV"" exposure (and likely a good chunk of the ""$125k-$500k"" range as well), since they accounted for 15% of transaction revenues and at lower-than-average take-rates (thus implying higher percent exposure of GPV). As such, the spectacular failure of the Starbucks deal demonstrates both that going forward Square will be, once again, most entirely a small-business focused payment processor, and that the company cannot make money serving enterprise clients. Both of these deductions suggest serious concerns over the ultimate scalability of the model.At this point, you are probably wondering why Square hasn't caught on with enterprise clients or larger consumer-facing businesses (despite the Starbucks debacle). After all - if it's such a hit with smaller businesses, surely the offering has something going for it? But recall that Square's initial market-share gains were a function of a) unmet needs, b) winning share on price, and c) ease/efficiency of use. Of these three factors, you could argue only in the last instance does Square hold an advantage when it comes to larger enterprises (if you believe Square's POS interface and back-end offerings are more efficient than the comp), though even this is debatable. But as for points a) and b): clearly the corporate market is highly competitive (Micros, NCR (NYSE:NCR), First Data (FDC), a number of banks, and even the likes of Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) now are all here), and Square cannot waltz in and offer a solution to an unmet need because, frankly, the need is being met. As for b): the Starbucks disaster clearly demonstrated how competing purely on price for larger-scale business worked neither for Square nor the client. That is not to say it will never work, and Square won't win any share - but certainly we should deduce that the chances of Square being able to replicate its initial and ongoing success with small businesses among larger enterprises - in the face of furious competition with more experienced, cashed-up players - is much, much lower.Competition is coming to the small business marketThe challenges Square appears to be facing vis-a-vis large enterprises are tough enough, but the coming threat to its bread-and-butter business of serving small businesses could be existential. As discussed, Square is winning in small businesses mostly because they were a first mover to an unmet need - but they are no longer the only player in town. Both Paypal and Verifone (NYSE:PAY) (among others) have already released competing dongles designed for mobile small businesses. Others, like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)m could soon follow. I will be the first to admit the Paypal and Verifone dongles don't look very cool but both companies have significantly greater financial resources than Square, and Paypal especially is on a growth mission to prove its relevance and defend its dominant share in another vertical (P2P payments) by expanding turf. Furthermore it has been an aggressive acquirer of ancillary services like Venmo and Xoom - both far superior offerings to Square's nascent ""Square Cash"" money-sending app (and we already mentioned the abject failure of Square Wallet). Suffice to say that the small-business payment processing space, though still likely to grow rapidly, may become much more price competitive going forward.The other corollary of this trend would be the need for Square to spend much more in advertising dollars to defend or win share - a problem when the business is already having trouble scaling and advertising dollars were actually cut in 2Q 2015 to make incremental operating losses seem less bad (likely to try to juice numbers for the IPO). As Square says in its S-1:While of course it's great to have a killer product that customers eagerly recommend, sentences like the above read to me as code for increasing marketing spend as the company grows beyond its initial core of early adopters - especially in the face of new and fierce competition. This does not bode well for trying to scale operating margins.The future of payments is… Apple Pay or die?I specifically haven't talked much about where the payments industry is heading, frankly because I'm not an industry expert. But even a few very broad strokes suggest a problematic outlook for Square. We already know Square is facing Herculean challenges in entering the large-enterprise space against entrenched, capital-rich competitors. But even looking at changes coming to the point of sale (PoS), it's difficult to see how Square can maintain a value proposition in the far future.Take Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), for example. At the moment this is basically a function that allows you to swipe your iPhone in front of a NFC (near field communication) terminal at CVS and pay for your groceries (via a link to your debit/credit card, etc.) without dipping your card. That is to say, at the moment, the payment architecture (whereby payment processor routes the transaction through the credit card network, receives approval/denial from the issuer, and routes it back) does not change - the consumer simply does not dip the card. This allows room for payment processors like Square but including the behemoths like First Data, etc, the ability to take a fee for processing the transaction.But if Apple Pay goes mainstream (as I and many think it will) and the technology improves slightly to allow for ""phone-to-phone"" NFC payments (this was already speculated a year ago and in my view happens in the near term), all of a sudden it becomes much more murky for payment processors. Of course, such a move immediately obviates the need for a physical dongle: this immediately puts Square's main hardware offering (and key network building-block) atop the technology dustbin. As already discussed, since Square is an entirely small business-focused processor, this move alone likely hits them harder than any of its competitors as all of a sudden their core user-base will no longer need their Square dongle and hence a good chunk of their transaction revenue could dry up.But taking this one step further, it's not a huge leap to think that Apple - already possessing many hundreds of millions of customer accounts and having built its own physical ""network"" through the dispersion of hundreds of millions of iPhones-payment terminals - will just become a payment processor itself. This puts the entire payment processing industry in Apple's headlamps - not the place you generally want to be, given their resources and track record. (As an aside: the credit card companies, who provide value because they can price the credit risk of their customers, probably have more survivability in this scenario, but will still probably see price pressure from such a development).Other issues - fraud costs a function of under-investment?This is all pretty scary stuff, and we haven't even gotten to the pricing of the shares. Actually, since the price hasn't been set, I will skip an in-depth analysis of the ""right"" valuation for Square and suffice by saying that a very high multiple of revenues (maybe 9-10x, assuming it comes at a premium to the $6bn valuation achieved in the last private financing round late last year) for a high-growth yet high-loss, high-cash burn, minimally-scaling business with demonstrated failure beyond its unprofitable core market and existential threats probably just a couple of years out, is fairly crazy. The only thing this IPO will do is make Paypal look exceedingly cheap at ~4x sales, low double-digit EBITDA multiples for a much-better positioned company (already fully scaled and dominant in its core vertical) churning out 20% operating margins and 20% top line growth today.What is actually more interesting is a couple of line items in the S-1 that may not be noticed by many but I think could be important: namely, ""Transaction and advance losses,"" as well as net capex spend in recent years. ""Transaction and advance losses"" is a line in operating expenses that the company describes as:These losses have been small in percent GPV terms as the company chooses to emphasize - but when reflected as a percent of either gross (ie, before paying fees to credit cards, banks) or net transaction revenues, these losses are concerning (4.6% of gross, and 15.7% of net transaction revenues, respectively, in 1H 2015).Clearly 16% of your net transaction revenue - when gross margins (even excluding Starbucks) are only ~35% - is highly problematic. And thinking about it another way - on a gross basis, this scale of fraud-related loss - around 5% - is strange given this is roughly what American Express provisions for credit losses - but Square is of course not a credit provider, it's just processing the transactions. To have this level of fraud-related losses hit them is fairly inexplicable and I think speaks to under-investment in necessary fraud-prevention software, human support, fail-safe transaction oversight, etc - itself a function of how capital-poor the company has been for much of the last couple of years. There also could be a corollary to Square's ease-of-use business model: the company promises transactions clear for merchants in 24 hours, which limits the window in which they can catch potentially fraudulent transactions and thus save themselves from these kinds of losses.This brings me to Square's capex, or rather lack of it. Square has spent a pitifully low amount on capex in recent years: just $29mm in 2014, and only $20mm in 1H 2015. This equates to 3-4% of revenues, while direct competitors like Paypal are spending 8-10% of revenues (on a much larger revenue base) and of course behemoths like Apple and Google, have limitless resources. It's just really tough to see how Square can even attempt to keep up with the Joneses at this level of capex intensity. Simply put - they won't.Why IPO now?All this leads back to the most important question: why IPO now? There have been persistent sale rumors regarding Square in the last year or so - apparently they were going to be sold to Apple for $3bn last December, though Dorsey turned that down and instead Apple focused on Apple Pay, while Square did another funding round at $6bn implied. Retrospectively, that move is looking more and more to me like Dorsey won the battle but lost the war.Frankly, the company as currently constituted - one good idea and great product, a number of product failures and unproven new ventures, highly cash consumptive, large market opportunity but increasing competition and existential threats around the corner, and very limited cash resources - would fit much better within the fold of a larger, cashed-up organization like an Apple or a Google than fighting on its own in the unforgiving public markets (my guess is this is what happens down the line, assuming they maintain relevance). Which of course begs the question, ""Why IPO?,"" and the pertinent answer is most likely ""dumb money"" - that is to say, strategic acquirers had no interest in paying nosebleed valuations but the unknowing public presumably will (but not you, dear reader).It will be interesting to see how Square prices and trades: the IPO market has been quite tough, given recent volatility (First Data repriced their IPO and it traded poorly), and Square will be a ""pie in the sky"" speculative offering. But even if it defies the gloomy backdrop and trades well, this is another hot tech IPO that, like so many others (Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), etc.) is more likely to end in tears. Caveat emptor.Disclosure: No positions (but may go long PYPL short Square post-IPO)."

(SSNC) is a Windsor, Connecticut-based company that provides services and software primarily for the global financial services industry, and to a lesser extent, the medical industry. With a market cap of $16.3B, and revenue exceeding $4.6B in 2019, SS&C has proven itself an established player in this space.SS&C has the capabilities and size to help serve companies' changing needs in a rapidly shifting landscape. New realities brought on by COVID have only sped up this transition. Cloud technology solutions, of which SS&C is a provider, will increasingly play a larger role in day-to-day management and operations. SS&C has the history, credibility, and resources to make further inroads in this sector.The demand for outsourcing solutions for middle and back-office operations is likely to see increased demand in the coming years. Financial firms, in particular, are expected to continue this already well-established practice of outsourcing functions, like accounting or human resources.From a revenue perspective, SS&C looks excellent. The past decade has seen revenues grow at a notable rate.Steadily rising revenue. Source: Y ChartsSS&C's trajectory has been impressive. Its earnings per share have been growing more aggressively over the past three years compared to its five and ten-year period. However, paid out dividends have slowed in growth during this period, and total asset growth has similarly slowed.How does SS&C stack up versus other large companies in the software application industry? Versus some comparable names (Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)), SS&C returns, although reasonable, have not performed as well, especially on a three and five-year window.On the other hand, SS&C shows encouraging signs in terms of other metrics. It's price-to-equity ratio, for example, is far lower than its comparables. This means its stock price is relatively low versus its reported earnings. Similarly, SS&C displays a favorable price-to-sales ratio versus the comparables, far lower than even the next best in the group.SS&C's debt-to-equity ratio, although less impressive than the comparables, is still reasonable at 1.299.From a pure performance perspective, SS&C has fared reasonably well over the past year. It outperformed the broader market, though it hasn't seen quite the same price appreciation as some other big names in the software industry. This isn't terribly concerning considering the industry as a whole has experienced impressive returns this year.U.S. outsourcing is predicted to increase by 7.5% annually, with much of this growth occurring in the financial services industry. With finance companies increasingly utilizing outsourced services for back-office functions, like accounting or compliance, SS&C will have a large pool of potential future clients. The rapid adoption of cloud services is only accelerating this reality.As far as future-proofing revenue, SS&C currently achieves high scores. Their well-established platforms, services, and systems are likely to be sought after in an increasingly remote and outsourced global economy.*Like this article?

4356291,104952,2020-06-30T01:03:56-04:00,"Even under the worst-case recovery scenario, SS&C should still expect a +$1 billion of OCF at year-end.The company also maintains its dividend growth and payment amid the crisis.The reduced net leverage to ~2.67 EBITDA and lower rates environment should allow SS&C to look for new key M&A deals in and beyond the second half.","We maintain our overweight rating on SS&C Technologies (SSNC), a company developing various software solutions for financial institutions. In our first coverage on the stock last December, we highlighted the company’s strong balance sheet and moat, driven by its presence in a high-barrier and low-switching cost financial industry market. Furthermore, DPS (Dividend Per Share) has also been growing steadily, even during the recent crisis. Against the challenging macro backdrop, SS&C will expect a bit of a slowdown in new sales for the full year. Nonetheless, some catalysts, such as more tuck-in M&As, cost-saving initiatives, and a resilient revenue stream, should allow SS&C to maintain its consistent growth and profitability profile.SS&C beat its guidance in Q1 and also announced three tuck-in acquisitions, Vidado, Capita, and Innovest. As stated in the company’s presentation, the guidance for the full year has not yet incorporated the revenues from these newly acquired companies.(Source: Company’s earnings call slide)Considering that Capita and Innovest generated $42 million and $20 million of revenues in 2019, the full-year revenue should see at least an additional +$62 million upside. Therefore, we think that the revenue outlook for the full year should look even better than the guidance. Despite the lower guidance outlook, profitability for the full year also looks solid across all the recovery scenarios.Net Income and EPS(Source: Company’s earnings call slide)Even under the worst-case scenario, in which SS&C will realize a ~$1 billion net income, the company will still maintain its earnings, EPS, and net margin figures from last year. Furthermore, SS&C can also reportedly take another $50 million to $70 million out of its cost structure, which, in addition to the lowering of its credit facilities’ LIBOR rates from 2.25% to 1.75%, should provide another profitability upside. Nonetheless, we believe that Q3 and Q4 recoveries should look more likely and conservative enough. In June, for instance, SS&C has continued landing key deals such as Mid Atlantic Group, which has chosen SS&C to automate its FINRA reporting.Revenue Retention Rate(Source: company’s earnings call slide)As such, we also believe that SS&C is well-positioned to maintain its resilience during a challenging time. As per the management comment in Q1, the majority of SS&C revenues come from the recurring business, which has been less impacted by the crisis. The ~96% revenue retention rate has also been in line with the historical average, while SS&C’s strong cash flow generation and balance sheet should allow it to reduce its leverage and acquire new companies going forward. In Q1 alone, OCF (Operating Cash Flow) increased by 7.5% to ~$148 million. As the company should expect ~$1.25 billion of OCF for the full year, we think that other acquisitions may be on the map considering SS&C may now have enough room to lever up after paying down its debts. In Q1, SS&C finally completed +$2.1 billion of debt payments related to its takeover of DST Systems in 2018, which ended up reducing its secured net leverage ratio to 2.67x EBITDA.The lower rates environment is favorable to SS&C, given that it can lever up at a lower cost of capital to engage in potential M&As. However, we think that the situation will also be favorable to both its competitors or potential high-value targets, which should now have an easier time raising growth capital. With that in mind, we believe that key acquisitions will not be as straightforward as expected, despite the potential $5.8 billion dry powder.SS&C Share Price YTD(Source: Seeking Alpha)SS&C share price has been under pressure in recent times, primarily due to the downward revision of the full-year revenue outlook to $4.5-4.6 billion from the previously $4.7 billion. The stock is currently trading at ~$55 per share, down ~20% from its YTD high, which we think presents a good entry point.SS&C Dividend Growth(Source: Seeking Alpha)As we have discussed, SS&C remains a financial software giant with strong bottom line and cash flow profitability, both allowing the company to grow its dividend and acquire attractive M&A targets. SS&C has acquired companies like Intralinks and DST Systems, which provided a significant boost to revenue growth in the past. On the other hand, SS&C also maintains its $0.125 quarterly dividend payment even during the crisis. At ~3x P/S, the price is fair given the catalysts. We feel that the P/S can always retrace the ~4x-6x levels seen in recent times upon the DST System takeover, potentially once SS&C announces another key M&A deal down the line. (Source: Stockrow)On a more speculative note, SS&C remains in a good position to do another M&A this year given the $5.8 billion dry powder, though management has indicated that it will only selectively aim for one with a strong EBITDA in addition to revenue to ensure moving the needle on both ends. Conservatively, assuming SS&C can acquire an M&A target that allows it to maintain TTM growth at ~13% (higher than the previous FY 2020 guidance, but lower than the inorganic growth upon Intralinks, DST Systems, and EZE integrations), SS&C will be looking at a potential target with ~$600 million of revenue, which is a smaller business than either DST System or Intralinks. Furthermore, assuming the unchanged ~27x P/E, SS&C should then trade at a forward PEG of ~2x, making it equally attractive from this standpoint."

4332109,104195,2020-03-16T03:50:55-04:00,Stronger-than-expected results (top- and bottom-line beats) indicate healthy organic revenue growth and improved margin in FY 20.There is significant upside from DST space (acquired in Q2/18) but timing is unclear.Strong cash flow generation likely to continue the deleveraging.,"SS&C Technologies (SSNC) reported 4Q19 adjusted organic growth of 4.7%, above market expectations and management guidance. In my view, the momentum is likely to continue into FY20, given its market-leading position, strong sales force and increasing outsourcing demand for back- and middle-office functions from alternative investment, especially private equity.The highly expected cross-selling opportunities from DST’s large customer base (61 million investor accounts) did not materialize in FY 19. The revenue from this acquired business was almost flat in FY19. I believe the challenge was two-fold. First, management focused efforts on margin improvement through automation, workforce restructuring as well as a cultural shift. After all, cutting costs without curbing revenue growth is a delicate business. Second, DST’s existing customers have already had offerings from SSNC’s competitors and high switching costs have posed a hurdle in conversion.Since the margin and revenue per employee rose back to the pre-acquisition level, driven by synergy realization and cost control, I think management now has more capacity to work on the conversion of DST’s clients to SS&C’s outsourcing platform where it offers a full suite of products.Source: company filings I think the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the conversion opportunity with improved execution and focus. The benefits (lower overall cost) of SS&C’s bundled products, strong brand awareness and the compatibleness of its systems with mutual funds encourage DST’s clients to migrate (a process that takes 5-6 months) to SS&C platforms from the current system (only offering investor accounts processing). With a conservative assumption of $20,000 per investor account, DST’s clients could potentially add as much as $3 trillion assets to SS&C’s AUA, which is the current addressable market for cross-selling and, if successful, could translate to $1 billion in revenue. However, the short-term impact on earnings is still unclear, given the time-consuming process. Highlighting the challenge was the wide range (0.5% to 3.9%) in management guidance for FY20 organic revenue growth.SSNC generated $1.3 billion cash flow from operations and paid down $1.1 billion net debt in FY19, pushing Net debt/EBITDA down to 3.77x, which I believe will continue to decline to less than 2x in FY21 and position the company for another major acquisition if it maintains mid-digit organic revenue growth.On the multiple side, the stock is currently trading at 10.6x EV/EBITDA as of Feb. 28th, compared to 11.4x on Feb. 25 (prior to market selloff) and 12x two-year historical average. On the earnings side, the market consensus estimates FY20 EBITDA at $1.916B vs. my estimate of $1.953B. I believe the upside potential outweighs the downside risks given that both a severe market meltdown (leading to earnings recession) and an economic recession (leading to multiple contraction) seem unlikely at this point.Source of trading multiples and consensus: BloombergOverall, I view SS&C as a solid long-term investment because of its high margin (40+ %) and differential advantage, supported by its large client base, a strong brand, and industry-leading technologies. I am confident that, given SS&C’s disciplined approach and strong execution, the integration of DST Systems (a potential major catalyst) will put SS&C on track to grow market share and improve operating margins while continuing to gain traction in legacy business (alternative investments), where there are opportunities for consolidation and substantial room for growth (P/E and real-estate). I would also like to point out the downside risk; that is, the valuation is highly correlated to the overall market, so a certain level of volatility is expected in the current market condition."
4260382,104662,2019-05-06T03:32:09-04:00,"SS&C Technologies stock dropped over 10% after lowering revenue guidance.The company also disappointed on both organic growth for the quarter and organic growth guidance.Secular trends in financial technology spending are still a strong growth driver.Management gave a high-level view of their plans for entering treasury management, a move that would boost the company's diversification and total addressable market.Consensus forward P/E is currently 15.9, which reflects the low organic growth and financial health.","After starting 2019 strong, SS&C Technologies Holdings (SSNC) suffered a correction last week following a disappointing quarter and weak guidance. In terms of price, SSNC likely suffered due to profit-taking, as the stock was under $45 at the beginning of the year. From a fundamentals standpoint, weakness in the company’s quarterly results could have revamped fears of its exposure to the hedge fund industry.Although the stock might have been overextended following its run into earnings, the bullish case for SSNC was built on its organic growth and cross-selling opportunities, following its mergers with DST and Intralinks. So far, this has yet to materialize. Even though SSNC has an excellent track record with acquisitions, expectations might have been too high entering into the earnings report. Investors shouldn’t panic, as synergies take time to materialize, especially regarding cross-selling.SSNC beat on the bottom line and posted in line revenue. Overall revenue growth reflects the multiple 2018 acquisitions, so the focus for investors is on organic growth. For the quarter, top line organic growth was a disappointing 1.3%, with organic revenue growth guidance decreased to 1.5% to 3.4%. Although SSNC is excelling in cost synergies from its acquisitions, the lack of organic growth is concerning, as UBS analyst Alex Kramm noted in the earnings call (the same bank which expected organic outperformance in March):Management didn’t have an exact answer to this question. They noted they’re cutting some revenue sources from DST that were no-margin products, but those don’t count in the organic revenue for this quarter. Most of the conference call was built on asking about the lack of organic growth, but no clear takeaway was made available by management.On the cost side, the company is ahead of schedule with expected synergies in the DST acquisition, as it is at $265 million versus an expected long-term target of $300 million. Although never stated by management, it's possible SSNC may have underestimated the costs of integrating DST with itself. Specifically, it sounds like SSNC is performing a full-scale reorganization of DST:Earlier in the call, SSNC noted that it added a new head of sales in financial services for DST, as well as a new head of sales for healthcare. There was also a comment about the addition of several new sales members.Despite the near-term headwinds and the disappointing quarter, SSNC is still benefiting from strong secular trends. Hedge funds are increasing their IT, compliance, and alternative data investments. Mutual funds and ETFs are continuously fighting to lower their fees, and similar to corporates investing in digitalization to lower their costs, mutual funds and ETFs need to improve their IT architecture to lower their overhead as well. To do this, they need SSNC.Source: SSNC (presentation)As high frequency trading, algorithmic trading, and nanosecond trades continue to become more prevalent, funds and financial institutions need their IT architecture to support this activity, whether it means handling a larger amount of data volumes (scalability provided by cloud architecture), automating manual processes (the recently enhanced Algo Wheel) and/or adding data integration capabilities (such as the AWD offering). Through acquisitions and internal innovation, SSNC has built an end-to-end offering to handle the entire IT architecture. This in itself lowers costs for firms, as IT departments don’t have to handle building interfaces or integrating applications.Source: SSNC (presentation)However, due to the industry environment, SSNC has to ensure it's at the forefront of tech innovation. Which means ensuring it has offerings that improve efficiency, workflow time frames, and exception handling. On the IT side, this means investing in RPA/automation, machine learning-backed workflows, and an underlying AI foundation to enhance workflow, compliance, and reporting speeds.Similar to other companies in the enterprise software space, SSNC will continue to be forced to increase spending, whether to acquire competitors or innovate internally, in order to protect its competitive position. But this also can become an advantage, as the company can pass on its technological capabilities into new offerings and new industries.One of those new offerings is SS&C Singularity, as described on the company's website:Though it is a new offering, and likely will need to go through an early adopter phase before impacting the financials, Singularity is an ambitious product that appears to be far beyond its competitors, at least compared to publicly available information regarding the company's products.Though not quite capable of entering the corporate treasury market, the combination of Singularity and the Intralinks acquisition led me to believe that SSNC will likely enter the treasury management industry soon, as Intralinks is already in that industry and Singularity is similar to an overall treasury management system. Although I speculated that SSNC could buy Kyriba to enter this space (Kyriba was bought in late March by a P/E firm), it now looks like the company may forgo buying a vendor and use its current capabilities to enter the market. As stated in the earnings conference call:Similar to what I wrote last quarter, SSNC would likely buy a cash management vendor, as its Singularity and Eze Eclipse offerings could likely be used to create a solution that handles transactions, accounting, and risk management, leaving a cash management / bank connectivity solution the lacking capability needed to be an end-to-end solution. The implication from the above quote likely refers to them assessing whether they can build this capability in-house or buy a current vendor. The two vendors I can see SSNC target are both owned by P/E firms (Kyriba and Finastra), so unless the company targets them, it looks like it will need to buy a niche player, as the other market players are likely too large for an acquisition by SSNC.Source: Strategic Treasurer (presentation link)Apps Run The World estimates that the addressable market will be $3.5 billion for Treasury and Risk Management, which appears to be measured by combining the revenue posted by the top 10 vendors. Many companies rely on Excel sheets or internal solutions to handle their treasury department, so the addressable market will likely increase as the treasury management market grows and vendors start producing lower-cost offerings.Revisiting the quarter end, management wanted the focus to be on cost savings and margins, and not on the top line weakness. When answering a question regarding whether investors can expect a return to 60% non-GAAP gross margins, management answered:Management has all but stated that margins will be deflated for the next couple years, as they perform a bit of a reorganization plan, integrate all of these new acquisitions, and bring to market their new offerings, such as Eze Eclipse and Singularity.Meanwhile, investors can expect an aggressive debt paydown strategy, as SSNC looks to regain flexibility in its balance sheet. The company is currently sitting on over $8 billion in debt versus $137 million in operating cash flow last quarter. Debt will likely drag on the financial stability of SSNC for several years going forward, and the lack of organic growth will magnify this weakness if it continues. Since the company's DST acquisition, it’s paid down over $1 billion in debt and is now operating at a 4.4 leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio. Regardless, its balance sheet is weak, and investors will need to see organic growth tick up before feeling confident in the company's financial health.This weakness also brings SSNC’s valuation down as well. Currently, the company is trading at a 15.9 consensus forward P/E. However, midpoint guidance is for $1.0 billion in net income and $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, with current market cap at $15.1 billion. If SSNC is able to overcome its rough quarter, it isn’t hard to see the company becoming even more undervalued when compared with the S&P average. However, it’s hard to outright state that SSNC is undervalued, given its organic growth disappointment, the DST integration struggles mentioned on the call, and the company's overall financial health.Now that the earnings call is over and the stock has reacted, investors need to focus on the future. Admittedly, the near-term outlook is not favorable, as expectations are low for this current quarter following that call. However, SSNC is in the process of improving internal efficiency and addressing synergy opportunities, which includes management and sales team turnover, cutting no-margin offerings, and having products that are still too new to show up in the financials.I’m still anticipating a treasury management system offering in the near to mid-term that will be in line with the company's diversification away from financial institutions and funds, which started with entering the healthcare market through the DST acquisition. Valuation reflects the lack of organic growth and financial health, and these two will likely not get significantly better next quarter. However, I believe that the market expected SSNC to integrate DST at a quicker rate than possible given SSNC’s track record.As new offerings such as Eze Eclipse, AWD, and Singularity move past the early adopter stage and SSNC finishes up its integration and reorganization of DST, the company is positioned to increase organic growth and increase margins to pre-merger highs. To support the bullish thesis, SSNC will likely need to have a bullish second-quarter conference call and post stronger third-quarter results, or else investors may start questioning the financial health and lack of value creation."
4240607,20715,2019-02-13T12:43:32-05:00,The company is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell on Thursday.Short sellers have become more bearish on the stock in recent months and the short interest ratio is at its highest level of the past year.The stock has formed a V-bottom after falling in the fourth quarter.,"Software firm SS&C Technologies (SSNC) is set to release earnings results after the closing bell on Thursday. If you aren't familiar with the company, the company provides software products and software-enabled services to the investment industry. These products help firms manage various aspects of their business including front- and back-office functions, trading and modeling, and portfolio management.Analysts expect the company to earn $0.85 per share on revenue of $1.11 billion. The company earned $0.54 in the fourth quarter of 2017, so analysts are looking for a year over year increase of 57%.Over the last three years, SS&C has averaged annual earnings growth of 23% and earnings grew by 58% in the third quarter of 2018. Sales have grown at an annual rate of 34% over the last three years and were up 137% in the third quarter.The company has beaten earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters.SS&C has strong management efficiency and profitability measurements. The return on equity sits at 16.6%, the profit margin is at 33.9%, and the operating margin is at 17.65%.SS&C rallied sharply from the beginning of 2017 through mid-2018. The stock price moved from below $30 a share to over $60 a share this past July. The stock did slip in the fourth quarter, but there were very few stocks that didn't fall in the fourth quarter.You can see on the chart how the stock fell below its 52-week moving average in October and continued lower and closed below its 104-week moving average in December. The stock has since bounced back above both of those moving averages.We see that the 10-week RSI was right at the 30-level in December and the weekly stochastic readings were hovering near or in oversold territory from October through late December. The rally over the last eight weeks has caused the stochastic readings to move into overbought territory and the RSI is close as well. The stock has gone up for eight straight weeks at this point.Turning our attention to the sentiment toward SS&C, we see that the indicators are mixed. There are 12 analysts following the stock and 11 have the stock rated as a ""buy"" while one has it rated as a ""hold"". This tells us that the analysts are pretty bullish toward the stock, but I am a little surprised there aren't more analysts following the stock.While analysts may be extremely bullish on the stock, short sellers certainly aren't. The current short interest ratio stands at 5.51 and that is the highest reading over the past year. When the company issued earnings at the end of October, the short interest ratio was only 2.85. The number of shares sold short jumped to 7.94 million at the end of January.SS&C doesn't see a great deal of options activity, but the current put/call ratio is at an incredibly low 0.40. While that low of a ratio is indicative of extreme optimism, I take it with a grain of salt because there are only 2,132 puts open and 5,351 calls open. That represents 748,300 shares of the stock and the average daily trading volume is 1.44 million shares.For the long term, I am bullish on SS&C Technologies, but there are a few things that concern me heading into the earnings report. I am a little concerned about the overall analysts' ratings being so bullish, but because there are only 12 analysts following the stock, it isn't a major concern.The second concern is the steep rally the stock has experienced in the last eight weeks. It is the epitome of a v-bottom chart and the fact that the oscillators have moved back up so much, that worries me a little.Honestly, I would love to see SS&C dip a little after its earnings report because I would love to add it to the Hedged Alpha Strategy portfolio, but I would have a hard time adding it right now based on the overbought/oversold indicators.The fundamentals are strong and there is some pessimism from the short sellers. The chart looks good in that it is in a long-term upward trend - if anything, it looks good because of the rally over the last eight weeks.I look for SS&C to continue moving higher over the next few quarters, but I would like to see a slight pullback for my own selfish reasons."
4311551,104952,2019-12-10T00:46:37-05:00,"With a solid Q3, SS&C Technologies is on track to post ~$4.6 billion by the end of the year, which represents ~34% YoY growth.It has been having positive free cash flow yield every year for the last 10 years while growing its FCF in absolute terms.The company’s recent shift into a software-enabled service business with a recurring revenue model will continue to strengthen cash flows and growth predictability.","SS&C (SSNC) has had a solid Q3 where the company grew its revenue by 15% YoY to ~$1.2 billion while also raising its Q4 and full-year outlook. With that in mind, the company is on-track to post ~$4.6 billion by the end of the year, which represents ~34% YoY growth. Overall, we believe that SS&C is an interesting company that will continue to present investors with potential upside due to a few things: 1) The company’s recent shift into software-enabled service business with a recurring revenue model will continue to strengthen cash flows and growth predictability. 2) SS&C has a strong balance sheet that continues to enable it to pursue attractive M&A deals to boost its growth. 3) The company competes in the financial services industry, which is characterized by high switching costs and entry barriers.Since 1995, SS&C has acquired 53 businesses that have contributed to the company’s strong financial performance as of today. In the last 10 years, it has also never spent a year without being profitable. The company reached a $1 billion revenue in 2015.(Source: Stockrow)Since 2015, revenue has grown by approximately three times. The company has also consistently posted a positive FCF (Free Cash Flow) yield every year for the last 10 years while growing its FCF in absolute terms. As of FY 2018, it generated a staggering $560 million of FCF. Furthermore, the company’s recent focus on increasing its software-enabled services since 2016 as the business expanded has been a margin-enhancement move. In 2018, recurring revenue from its software-enabled services made up 82% of the total revenue, which is a substantial increase from only 65% of total revenue in 2016.The strong cash-generating ability and balance sheet have enabled the company to pursue the most attractive strategic acquisition deals. In April 2018, SS&C acquired DST Systems to expand its business into the Healthcare services market. DST Systems generated a revenue of ~$2.5 billion prior to the acquisition. The recent $1.5 billion acquisition of Intralinks in 2018 is another key deal. Previously, we have known Intralinks for its virtual data room platform that allows financial services and investment firms to securely manage their sensitive documents. The acquisition creates a strategic value where Intralinks can leverage SS&C’s core client base, which includes PE (Private Equity) and hedge fund firms. On the other hand, SS&C will enrich its ecosystem of offering and drive more cross-selling opportunities across the board.Ultimately, we believe that all these will allow SS&C to extend its solid run through its strengthened moat. Given the recent expansion into the Healthcare market, the company will also see a strong tailwind from the macro perspective. As the market research suggested, the demand for insurance and retail investment will continue to drive the growth in a $26.5 trillion financial services market. The increase in retail investment activities will also drive the demand for SS&C solutions going forward.Financial services, brokerage, and investment firms need to deal with strict compliance with rules and regulations on a periodic basis. SS&C solutions serve as painkillers that help these firms to manage the painful compliance processes seamlessly across their businesses. Eventually, the opportunity cost to replace the system will be higher as SS&C clients’ managed assets and compliance complexities grow, creating a strong moat for the company.Fundamentally, SS&C remains exposed to the downside risk of the global financial market, though the company's strong balance sheet position and management help alleviate the issue. During the market downturn, however, we see a challenge where it would be difficult to raise debt financing to fund additional large-scale acquisitions necessary to move the needle given SS&C's ~$15 billion market cap.For a company that generated ~$3 billion of revenue last year and a ~21% 5-year CAGR, we believe that SS&C is attractively priced. Furthermore, there is also an upside through dividend payout, whose growth has been steady in the last few years.(Source: Seeking Alpha)In FY 2019, we will see a record-high payout growth of ~42% YoY with a DPS of $0.425. SS&C currently trades at a trailing P/S of ~3.28. With an expectation of $4.8 billion in FY 2020 and the assumption of an unchanged share count of ~252 million, we set our price target at ~$62 per share. Overall, the company’s strong financials, business fundamentals, and solid executions present a great buying opportunity for technology investors looking for exposure to the combinations of a recurring revenue model, growing dividend payout, and financial services type of moat."
4287830,104855,2019-08-26T02:03:43-04:00,Downward guidance revision was a result of revenue growth rate miscalculation back in Q1 19 and not because of a business slowdown.We anticipate that strong upsell/cross-sell opportunities of the recently acquired customer base will accelerate the organic revenue growth rate in the near future.The stock price can return back to $60 over the next twelve months.,"SS&C Technologies (SSNC) is a leader in the enterprise software & solutions for the asset management market and offers a powerful business model, with a significant cross-sell opportunity of a newly gained customer base after major acquisitions in 2018. We like the stock because of its cloud-related initiatives which are transitioning the company to a purer SaaS business model, thus driving margin expansion in the near future. According to the market research report created by Mordor Intelligence, the Software & Services market of the financial industry is expected to reach CAGR of 7-8% over the next 5 years. SSNC has been taking advantage of positive industry dynamics in the past, by generating inorganic revenue CAGR of 30% with a 95% retention rate, EPS CAGR of over 20%, combined with a very strong margin expansion since its IPO back in 2010.The company has a strong competitive advantage by offering a broad suite of products that simplify and unify tasks from several departments across the entire financial institution. Particular products help the asset management firms to make better strategic decisions when it comes down to generating excess return rather than spending time on unnecessary trade execution or regulatory tasks. Even though the company has recently cut its Q3&Q4 and full-year FY19 guidance, we still believe that the company can execute on new large deals. In our opinion, it will result from its long-term partnerships and strong customer relationships, thus making strong cross-sell opportunities or even receiving a higher number of outsourced services from the existing client base.(Source: Investor Presentation, June 2019)The company has a 97% of recurring revenues which makes it a very solid stock pick in the times of a recession or during the late-stage business cycle. We like the fact that almost 80% of revenues come from the Americas, thus making it more immune to all the uncertainty around the U.S.-China trade issues as well as the present slowdown in the macroeconomic growth of the key European economy Germany. In terms of client concentration, revenues are highly diversified as the company’s largest client represents only less than 5% of total revenues. In general, contracts are usually one to five years long and are subject to automatic annual renewal, thus making cash flows highly predictable and less volatile.(Source: Investor Presentation, June 2019)We especially like the stock because of its high margin business model with an EBITDA margin of roughly 40% over the last decade. However, given the size of DST and Intralinks acquisition in 2018, EBITDA margin dropped by 400 bps Y/Y to 37% in FY 18. Nevertheless, we are confident the company can drive its margin expansion over the next several years, especially when it successfully integrates newly acquired technologies and fully materializes on anticipated cost synergies.(Source: Investor Presentation, June 2019)The company has been highly accretive to its shareholders with an EPS CAGR of 26.7% since its IPO in 2010. We believe that once the company successfully drives down its leverage below 4.0x it will continue to drive further double-digit EPS growth with an increased number of share buybacks as well as strong earnings generation from the future business performance.(Source: Investor Presentation, June 2019)According to the figure above, industry dynamics have been very favorable for the company so far, with an estimated total CAGR of 6% between 2016 and 2021. The largest financial institutions or funds have huge internal workforces and highly sophisticated IT systems, which are very costly to maintain and are becoming more expensive year after year. Most of the internal IT systems are outdated what makes the company in the financial industry very inflexible when it comes down to implementing the most recent IT trends or solutions in the house.One of the biggest reasons for the growing trend of IT outsourcing within the financial industry is the fact that asset managers prefer to focus on their core business competencies like delivering great alpha. Furthermore, the increased popularity of ETFs has created a very high pressure on the asset management fees, therefore particular companies are trying to minimize operational expenses and be as cost-effective as possible.Because of cost optimization purposes they usually outsource certain IT services or operational functions. They usually select SS&C for outsourcing some of their key operational functions like compliance or mail center, given the fact that SS&C has built a very strong reputation and customer loyalty over the last 30 years.Considering the fact that the largest global financial institutions like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) or HSBC spend billions of dollars on their Software & IT services, management expects the addressable market of outsourcing opportunity in the size of several hundred million dollars. We believe that the company can reach this target which still makes up a tiny portion of the entire $300 billion Software & IT services spending market of financial institutions worldwide.(Source: 10-Q Filing, July 2019)The company reported adjusted revenue of $1.16 billion in Q2 19 or up 27.2% Y/Y, beating the consensus analyst estimate of $1.15 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS came out at $0.91 in Q2 19, thus beating the consensus analyst estimate of $0.85. In terms of margins, adjusted consolidated EBITDA and operating margin were 38.8% and 19.5%, respectively. The Chairman and CEO Bill Stone stated:During the quarter, the company closed several important deals with few Asian clients for Geneva, Black Diamond, Eze’s products and SS&C GlobeOp fund administration services. A very important deal was with the $12-billion asset manager which chose hosted outsourced services model over the existing on-premise software. We see a huge potential in the outsourcing services business as most of the major DST clients will most likely look for particular solutions on the market over the long run. In our opinion, management has set a very good strategy to land new clients by offering them solutions like Singularity or EZE Eclipse cloud platform at the beginning. After a while when they build a strong business relationship then clients might be more prone to outsource vital IT services to the company or choose other SSNC’s products as well.The company lowered its Q3 & Q4 19 guidance primarily because of loss of DST clients resulting in the amount of $38 million for Q3 19. However, we are optimistic that SSNC is well-positioned to further penetrate existing DST customer base with strong cross-selling opportunities of newly established products in the near future. One of the key reasons for a lower guidance revision was a lower projected annual revenue to be down $53 million from the announced guidance in Q1 19 for DST acquisition. The CEO provides even more insight during the most recent earnings call.Now we are unsure whether the management couldn’t predict the amount of DST pre-acquisition terminated clients already back in Q1 19. However, we believe that the lower guidance revision of annual DST revenue number results from a wrong revenue projection by management, especially when it comes down to the timing of a revenue generation of new large customers. For instance, it can take up to 6 months before the company starts recording revenues from this new large accounts which are very competitive to land. Management reflects that and calms down investors by providing even more detail:Even though the management revised its revenue guidance for the Q3 19 and FY 19, it is still optimistic about the future free cash flow generation of close to $1 billion. We believe that the market participants had exaggerated by plummeting stock price over 20% after the Q2 19 earnings release.Sales representatives of the acquired DST company were quite successful when it comes down of generating pipeline and landing new clients. However, the final execution of particular deals leading to a significant impact on revenue size might take several quarters or even years. We are optimistic that the execution of new large deals will be a key growth driver in the near future. We believe that the EZE Eclipse platform is the most compelling product when it comes down to landing new clients with later strong cross-selling opportunities throughout the contract duration.(Source: EZE Soft website)Eze was the key acquisition back in October 2018 in a transaction of $1.45 billion in cash. Management has very high expectations of an EZE Eclipse cloud platform which was released back in 2017. It simplifies execution and reporting of trades for asset managers in a single web interface and optimizes front-to-back office operations. We believe in the commercial success of Eclipse cloud platform, given the fact that the company works together with its clients and is labeled by longer customer lifespan compared to on-site legacy products. Management puts a very strong emphasis on making unique tailored solutions for each customer individually, thus meeting their specific technical requirements or needs. The go-to-market approach creates a unique opportunity for cross-selling of other SSNC products. For instance, newly acquired Eze Eclipse clients might decide for other flagship products like Geneva or decide to outsource some of their IT services. Management anticipates it can turn a $100,000 Eze client into several million worth of revenue. Consequently, we are highly optimistic of this long-term value extraction opportunity of over 2,500 EZE clients globally, which is not primarily reflected in the stock price at the moment.Even though Eze business line receives fixed payments from its clients and its sales force is landing an increased number of new customers quarterly, management still anticipates a $10 million lower revenue in Q3 19 related to expected slow-down of trading volume across Wall Street. Once uncertainty over the U.S.-China trade war and global macroeconomic growth vanishes, then Eze business segment is well-positioned to capitalize on the trading volume rebound and generate double-digit growth rate.We anticipate the strongest opportunity for the EZE business segment in the small to mid-size asset management market. For instance, smaller funds cannot hire a higher number of employees just to oversee regulatory or compliance requirements like their bigger competitors. In that case, smaller funds would lose time and focus on generating new investment ideas leading to a lower alpha compared to larger counterparts. Consequently, smaller firms have to use advanced technological capabilities like automation or AI. We believe that SSNC is well-positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity with the EZE Investment Suite as the best solution available on the market.Looking forward, over the next several quarters we anticipate that the company will not close any kind of acquisitions of a significant magnitude. Furthermore, we expect that management will most likely conduct a minor acquisition in financial services space to support the current development of the pipeline or to enhance existing offerings in the fund administration space. One reason is stretched valuations of Software & Services companies given the near the record levels of the major US indices and increased inflow of Private Equity and alternative funds money into the market over the last several years. Management prioritizes acquisitions with a reasonable risk/reward level and a discount to intrinsic value leading to strong value creation for its shareholders. In terms of the deleveraging process after acquisitions, the company will work on reducing net debt/EBITDA level under 4 as quickly as possible.According to YCharts figure above, the company has been very successful so far in the past. For instance, the company could bring leverage ratio down from over 6.0x to under 4.0x over a couple of quarters after its acquisition of Advent software back in July 2015. SSNC is trading at the current financial debt to EBITDA (ttm) ratio of 4.77x; therefore, we anticipate that the company will use its generated free cash flows to prioritize deleveraging process over any kind of significant share buybacks or dividend increases throughout 2019.Shares are now trading at forward P/E and EV/REV multiple of ~12.6x and ~4.4x, respectively. Both multiples are trading at a discount compared to the peer group and also at a discount compared to the S&P 500 market average forward P/E multiple of ~17.5. We believe that a further execution of new large deals combined with realized cost synergies and extracted value from the most recent acquisitions might bring the stock price back to the historical average EV/REV multiple of ~6.0x what makes up a ~40% upside over the next twelve months.(Source: Finviz)Following the disappointing guidance revision, the stock price declined approximately 17% on July 30, 2019. If we take a look at technical analysis, the stock price has been in the downtrend after it reached its peak value of $67 in April 2019. Our near-term bullish catalyst is a better-than-expected execution of new large deals over the next several quarters which can lift the stock price back to the range of $55.0-60.0. On the other hand, if the company does not execute on new deals or even announces disappointing Q3 19 earnings numbers, then the stock price will most likely drop below the key support level of $40.0 to the next key psychological level of $30.We expect that continued uncertainty over global political affairs and global macroeconomic slowdown might continue to negatively impact global financial markets, M&A market activity, and overall financial services industry. Consequently, we expect a lower business growth rate of financial services combined with lower trading volume across Wall Street, what will have a negative impact on the revenue growth rate of the key SSNC products and services.During the most recent earnings calls, management emphasizes execution of new large deals; however, there is a reasonable risk that the company might fail to do so. For instance, the company has been expanding its sales force over the last couple of quarters; however, they might need longer than expected to learn all the tricks of the underlying business and execute on new large deals. For instance, when conducting large deals they usually require multiple presentations and personal meetings compared to smaller deals; therefore, revenue growth might stay under pressure for a noticeable period.In our opinion, a new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 represents one of the major risks for the stock price performance over the next several quarters. For instance, with the new ASC 606 standard, the company has to report the total amount of revenues from its newly signed or renewed long-term contracts already at the beginning. Consequently, we believe that the revenue growth rate will be more volatile compared to the past. Additionally, management will be under more pressure to execute on new deals on a quarterly basis to meet Wall Street expectations of future high growth rate.We believe that the recent stock price decline following the Q2 19 earnings number represents a good entry point for investors who are willing to take on more risk. In our opinion, the majority of market participants most likely focused on the news headline about the lower guidance revision. However, they didn’t consider the fact that the management did a forecasting mistake back in Q1 19; therefore, we believe guidance revision wasn’t a result of an expected decline in the operational performance for the rest of 2019. Furthermore, we are optimistic that the company will be successful when it comes down to integrating the most recent acquisitions - DST Systems, Intralinks, and EZE Software as well as achieving anticipated benefits out of them. We see a great example of cross-selling opportunities when it comes down to newly acquired clients of the EZE Investment Suite as they might be willing to outsource certain internal IT services or buy the other SSNC products like Singularity or Geneva. Apart from general macroeconomic and political risks, we find one of the major risks at the moment lower-than-expected execution on the new deals as well as failed integration or value extraction from the most recent acquisitions."
4249984,103231,2019-03-20T10:29:02-04:00,"SS&C presents an attractive investment thesis based on acquisitions, growth above industry, and expansion of margins.SS&C has an attractive value offer, as the price ratios are still below historical levels.Although leverage is still a risk to consider, we see that the company will continue to increase its value in the medium term.","SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: SSNC) has experienced strong momentum that has led to a 40% appreciation in the value of its shares so far this year, reaching record highs. The price of SS&C’s shares has not only performed better than other software infrastructure companies but also holds more buy recommendations from analysts. The market has become more optimistic about the company's future as experts anticipate organic growth to increase this year, as suggested by a UBS analyst. Image source: SS&C Twitter ""Analyst Day in NYC.""Although the company's revenues have maintained a fantastic growth rate following the acquisitions of Intralinks, DST Systems, and Eze Software during 2018, we see that the enthusiasm of analysts for SS&C has been recent. The number of buy recommendations for the company has skyrocketed after the presentation to analysts in mid-November.While synergies are expected to give a healthy boost to revenues for the coming years, we believe that the company's price multiples remain below historical averages, even after the recent appreciation. We think that SS&C presents an attractive investment thesis under the following arguments: revenue growth above the industry, margin expansion, capital allocation strategy, and compressed valuations.SS&C's revenues come mainly from its software-enabled services, which allow financial service providers to automate complex trading processes. The end clients of the company come mostly from the finance sector, being the most important institutions of asset management and alternative investments.SS&C manages a broad portfolio of services, designed to fulfill specific functions for each type of client. The company makes use of the acquisitions of businesses and complementary technologies to increase its service offer since its inception in the stock market. This strategy has become more aggressive lately as executives completed three of the company's four most significant acquisitions during 2018. The purchases of Intralinks, DST Systems, and Eze Software have been successfully integrated into the SS&C offer, giving it a clear differentiation in the financial services market.Source: Extracted from SS&C’s Investor Presentation.These acquisitions, with a value of more than $8.0 billion, caused the company's revenues to skyrocket from $1.68 billion in 2017 to $3.42 billion in 2018, an increase of over 100%. Now that the company has integrated these lines of business into its portfolio, executives expect revenues for this year to be in the range of $4.69 and $4.79 billion, which would represent a 36% increase at the mid-point.In addition to this inorganic growth, SS&C has benefited from a series of trends coming from its end markets. The market for software and financial services has evolved rapidly thanks to the introduction of new products and technologies based on artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic process automation (RPA). The trend coming from internal digital transformation projects by financial institutions has driven the revenue of almost all IT system providers that offer this type of tool set. SS&C has developed SS&C Singularity to capture this trend, its first intelligent accounting system with artificial intelligence. It seems to us that this product, aimed at the capital markets and global banking segments, is well-positioned to benefit from the investments in new technologies that financial institutions are carrying out.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.Comparatively speaking, we think that SS&C maintains attractive growth rates, especially from the perspective of free cash flow. We estimate that the dynamics of the financial industry, which is being marked by a migration to cloud systems, increased regulations, the complexity of compliance, and a technological paradigm shift, will keep revenues in a prolonged organic growth streak.Although the acquisition strategy has driven growth in the top line of the income statement, these purchases have weighed on the company's profitability. Operating income for 2018 was $429 million, or 12.5% ​​of revenue, well below the 24% seen in 2017. This contraction in margins was mainly due to the costs of sales, and general and administrative expenses that soared during the second quarter of 2018, following the acquisition of DST Systems.However, the management of SS&C has made great efforts to integrate these businesses into the company's operations, which have begun to generate synergies. Both gross and operating margins recovered their normal levels in the fourth quarter, as a result of cost reduction initiatives and financial discipline. Now, executives expect to find even more opportunities for operational savings that will generate $300 million in annual savings by 2021.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.On the free cash flow side, SS&C generated approximately $551 million of FCF during 2018, a figure that was impacted by transaction costs related to the acquisition of DST Systems. We see that after the efforts to integrate the acquired businesses, this figure has returned to normal levels during the last quarter of the year. We believe that management's ability to maintain a positive FCF is an attractive feature since it has allowed the company to increase the payment of its dividend while paying down its long-term debt.Although leverage still seems somewhat elevated compared to the standards of the software infrastructure industry, we believe that the efforts to clean up the balance sheet of the debt acquired from DST Systems adds to the arguments in favor.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.In summary, we estimate that the expansion of margins observed in the last quarter will continue during 2019, as the company continues integrating the recent acquisitions into its operations. This increase in profitability will allow the management of SS&C to generate a positive free cash flow that can be used to pay down debt or increase the dividend payment. On the growth side, we expect the new lines of business to offer additional synergies that allow cross-selling of services.By looking at the price ratios, we believe that SS&C has an attractive value offer, especially from the perspective of the PS ratio. This metric that saw a rapid rebound at the beginning of 2018 has compressed after each quarterly report until falling to levels below its three-year median. We believe that the bounce in revenue after acquisitions and doubts about the integration of these businesses have contributed to this temporary imbalance.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.In relative terms, investors can see that the company mostly maintains ratios below those of the software infrastructure industry, staying at a discount compared to similar companies. We find attractive that the forward metrics of SS&C suggest a rapid compression in the future, increasing this differential even more.We believe that although the market has remained optimistic about the prospects of the company, some investors are somewhat skeptical about whether the new business lines will live up to expectations. Although leverage remains a risk that investors should consider, we see that the company has an excellent position to continue with the appreciation of its shares over the medium term."
4234465,104662,2019-01-21T01:21:02-05:00,"SS&C was one of the top performers of 2018, with the share price rising 11%.Three acquisitions during the year have hurt the balance sheet, but cost savings are already growing faster than expected.SS&C recently entered the healthcare space and could expand to the corporate treasury space next.Kyriba, a top performer in the treasury management systems market, could be an excellent fit for SS&C.SS&C is currently trading at a 13.97 forward P/E and 12.2 forward P/FCF.","SS&C Technologies Holdings (SSNC) had an eventful 2018 marked by three major acquisitions throughout the year. These acquisitions build up a solid base for revenue growth through cross-selling, product offerings, and new niche market entries. This revenue is then protected through high customer retention rates, high switching costs, and vendor lock-in. Below, I will summarize the company’s three acquisitions in 2018 and how entry to the corporate treasury management systems market is a logical next step for SS&C.SS&C acquired three companies during 2018: DST Systems, Intralinks, and Eze Software. These three acquisitions took up approximately $8 billion in cash/debt and $500 million in equity.DST Systems - SS&C acquired DST systems for about $5.4 billion. The DST acquisition increased SS&C’s client base in the institutional, alternative, and wealth management industries. In addition to growing market share, SS&C also gained entry into the mutual fund and healthcare services markets. Mutual funds are a natural expansion of the company’s portfolio, where it is now the #1 financial technology vendor for long-only portfolio administration.This acquisition has great potential for cross-selling, as new clients brought by DST can be sold SS&C’s offerings in fund and adviser services, technological offerings, BPM, automation, and ERP.Source: SS&C IRIn addition, DST also offers access to the healthcare sector, the first sector SS&C will serve outside of the financial industry. Its healthcare offerings include disease, case, and utilization management, and then overall financial and pharmaceutical management as well. Healthcare and financial services are two heavily regulated sectors where SS&C will benefit from high switching costs, as its offerings are operationally critical, and any vendor switch would be exceptionally expensive due to operational and time disturbances. Overall, healthcare is expected to take up about 11% of future revenue.Intralinks - This acquisition is based on expanding offerings rather than expanding its customer base. This is evident by the relatively low potential run rate cost savings of $15 million. On the surface, there isn’t a large value-added acquisition, which led to a DA Davidson downgrade that noted:Although I don’t necessarily disagree with this, SS&C will likely have some intangible benefits from Intralinks. Intralinks specializes in information management, which heavily consists of tracking and monitoring sensitive and confidential data. This addition to SS&C’s portfolio is an almost completely new product offering and helps the company establish a wide-ranging enterprise software offering, which creates a vendor lock-in advantage. Vendor lock-in increases retention rates and switching costs, as well as creates a platform to introduce new products and increase cross-selling potential.Eze Software - Eze specializes in providing a software ERP platform for hedge funds. Its main offering, which SS&C highlighted in the acquisition press release, is Eze Eclipse, which is an end-to-end SaaS offering covering both the front-end and back-end functions, including trading, allocation management, and compliance etc.Source: Eze SoftwareSimilar to the Intralink acquisition, this is focused on expanding SS&C’s product portfolio and on the potential to grow through cross-selling. Eze provides both front and back office functionality, which is part of the reason why I believe SS&C could acquire a company that performs a similar functionality for a different sector.Based on its recent acquisitions, I believe SS&C is in a prime position to enter the corporate treasury management system market. Several of the key challenges that CFOs note are highlighted below, which also are similar to functions SS&C provides for its core client base.Source: DeloitteThis means that SS&C could likely take advantage of run rate cost savings and synergies in any acquisition. However, specific features that relate to areas such as cash management, SEC reporting, and bank messaging are capabilities that the company currently doesn’t have. This makes me believe that the company will likely acquire a current vendor rather than build its own offering. Therefore, SS&C could acquire Kyriba.Kyriba is a treasury management systems provider known for being one of the top vendors in the market. IDC MarketScape rates Kyriba as one of the best solutions in this space and highlights its strengths in security and privacy, reporting, and bank connectivity. These strengths fit well with SS&C, whose strength would be on the front office transaction side relating to hedging, trading, and swaps. The company’s strengths in transactions would match with Kyriba’s noted strengths in cash management and accounting/reporting.Source: IDCKyriba and SS&C could create a complete treasury management software system offering a SaaS solution that covers most of the treasury workflow.SS&C would also benefit by cross-selling its front-end transaction capabilities centered around FX hedging, allocation analysis, and other trading-related products. However, it would likely focus on growing market share in corporate treasury, as Kyriba only holds a small amount of the overall treasury management system market, which could be boosted by added capabilities from SS&C.Source: Apps Run The WorldCurrently, ION Trading is estimated to be the top market leader by market share with an estimated 13% of the market. However, the definition of the treasury market isn’t clear, as IDC didn’t have ION included in their report (although they did buy Reval). Ernest & Young also reports a large amount of competitors in the market.Kyriba is reported to have around 30% revenue growth and $100 million yearly revenue. Based on the acquisitions noted above, SS&C would likely need to pay close to $500 million in an acquisition, although Kyriba is growing at a faster rate than previous acquisitions, which could drive the price up.Based on its largest acquisition of 2018, DST Systems, it is clear to see that part of the purchase was entry to a new market: healthcare. SS&C has a large and successful history of M&A, and the corporate treasury market could logically be the next market SS&C enters, one that should fit the company's strategy even better than healthcare.Regardless of possible future moves, investors should focus on what is known and the current state of SS&C, which is a fast-growing company that is in the middle of incorporating three major acquisitions. However, in the middle of the market sell-off last quarter, it also noted an increased amount of expected cost synergies.First, I will review relevant valuation metrics for SS&C below:Source: Morningstar, SS&C IRSS&C currently has a messy balance sheet and cash flow statement due to its acquisitions. Before reviewing the company's valuation, it is important to note its leverage first. Management has noted the need to lower their leverage as a priority, which lowers the potential of a major acquisition in the first half of the year. However, recurring revenue, retention rates, and vendor lock-in helps ease the pain of the leverage, as cash flow should remain stable as the company pays off debt.Source: SS&C IRSS&C will be operating with a weak balance sheet throughout 2019. However, the company has a great track record for operating with and paying off large debt. FCF guidance is $1 billion for 2019, which provides SS&C with flexibility as it pays off debt.Back to valuation, the company has a market cap of $12 billion. For 2019 guidance, this values SS&C at 14x forward earnings and 12x forward FCF. Part of this low valuation is due to uncertainty of combining three new businesses, and the synergies associated with it. Cost savings for DST, the first one of 2018 and the largest, are on track to beat SS&C’s estimates already, with management noting:In fact, analyst Surinder Singh Thind, from Jefferies LLC, noted:However, this news was released during the market sell-off, and SS&C shares weren’t rewarded for this. So far, there has been no catalyst for the company to make up for its low valuation, which explains the significant difference between recent price targets, which include Deutsche Bank with a $72 price target and Needham naming SS&C a top buy for 2019. I believe its valuation will rise as investors start seeing synergies show up in the financials.As outlined above, SS&C will have a weak balance sheet for the foreseeable future, although cash flow generation should remain strong.A stretched balance sheet may also not prevent SS&C from continuing to buy companies, which could result in more debt. Also, despite having a strong record in cost savings and paying off debt, any missteps could significantly hurt its financial health.Source: SS&C IRAlthough SS&C is expanding its markets, the company's exposure to hedge funds and mutual funds may become a headwind in the future. Hedge fund closures could accelerate and hurt its addressable market. This could also be why SS&C has been more aggressive in acquisitions this year.Investors should also consider overall market risk as well, as the market has been exceptionally volatile, even though it’s been mainly positive since 2019 started.The company has been hit hard by the market sell-off, and is trading at low multiples despite operating in favorable market conditions. Even if SS&C doesn’t enter the corporate treasury market anytime soon, cost savings and strong organic growth present a favorable growth opportunity at a low cost. As cost savings are realized and debt is paid, I believe SS&C stock will appreciate faster than EPS and FCF growth as valuation returns to a level closer to 18x EPS rather than the current 13x.Disclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

4137108,25120,2018-01-12T03:23:21-05:00,"SS&C is acquiring DST in a deal which is very well received by the market.Investors understand the strategic and financial rationale behind the deal, as the company is now valued at $18 billion.While I really like the deal, the valuation has jumped a great deal, as the valuation is too steep for me.","SS&C Technologies (SSNC) has reached an agreement to acquire DST Systems (DST) in a deal which will create quite a giant in the provision of software and related services to institutions, alternative and wealth management clients, among others.The market likes the deal a whole lot as the combination seems to have become stronger as a result of the deal, on top of the benefit of projected sizable synergies. In fact, the valuation of the combination has jumped by nearly $3 billion on the back of $150 million in anticipated synergies, indicating that the market is very happy with the deal.While I like the deal as well, leverage of the pro-forma business will be elevated at 5 times. At the same time, the pro-forma earnings multiples (even including synergies) remain very elevated nonetheless, making it easy for me to avoid shares at these levels. I would not dare to short SS&C as its dealmaking strategy is of high quality as the company has created a lot of shareholder value in the past because of its savvy deals.SS&C has reached an agreement to acquire DST at $84 per share which values the company at $5.4 billion including net debt. With the deal SS&C will obtain a provider of technology, advisory and outsourcing to the financial as well as healthcare industry.The deal seems really driven by combining the core expertise of both businesses. DST has clients in retirement and wealth management, while SS&C provides superior software platforms, allowing for increased automation and thereby improved servicing of clients at lower costs.The deal announcement is furthermore a response to rapid rate of change which is impacting the industry both on a technology and regulatory front. Furthermore, both companies have some sort of relationship and familiarity with each other after SS&C acquired DST Global Solutions back in 2014.The overlap is the key reason to become a better business and in an effort to cut costs by an estimated $150 million a year as well. As a result of a gradual increase in synergies, SS&C expects mid-teens earnings per share growth in 2019.The strange thing about this deal is that DST is actually much larger, at least if you look at the revenue number. DST generates $2.33 billion in adjusted revenue while SS&C comes in at $1.64 billion on a trailing basis.DST is much less profitable compared to SS&C. It reports adjusted EBITDA of $459 million, for EBITDA margins of 20%. SS&C has far greater EBITDA margins. Adjusted EBITDA of $678 million translates into margins of 41%, more than twice the margins posted by DST.Combined EBITDA runs at $1.14 billion and jumps to $1.29 billion following the realisation of synergies. SS&C reported D&A charges of $235 million as DST's D&A charges stand at $120 million. Including a combined 74 million in stock-based compensation, adjusted EBIT comes in at $761 million ahead of synergies or $911 million after synergies.The company will leverage up the balance sheet to 5 times net leverage which combed with $1.3 billion in EBITDA (after accounting for synergies) implies net debt of $6.5 billion. As SS&C operates with a net debt load of $2.2 billion, this implies that $4.3 billion of the $5.4 billion deal tag will be borrowed.Net debt of $6.5 billion results in interest expenses of $325 million if we assume a 5% cost of debt. That suggests pre-tax earnings of $436 million ahead of synergies or $586 million including synergies. After accounting for 25% taxes, that yields net earnings of $327 million to $440 million.SS&C has 206 million shares outstanding as it will need to issue $1.1 billion worth of shares to finance the deal. This involves the issuance of another 22 million shares at $50 per share. This dilutes the share count to 228 million shares, suggesting that GAAP earnings come in between $1.40 and $1.90 per share.While one can claim that the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is substantial as a result of large impairment charges at SS&C, multiples remain pretty elevated nonetheless. DST earned $1.40 on an adjusted basis in the first nine months of the year and $0.77 per share on a GAAP basis, which annualised works out to $1.85 and $1.00 per share, respectively. The comment about double-digit earnings per share growth in 2019 might look compelling, but I really have no taste to buy into a 5 times leveraged business, even as earnings might see a big boost next year.Even working with adjusted assumptions calling for $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings and $2.00 in GAAP earnings in a year or two, multiples are quite elevated at $50, especially given the leverage situation.Since rumours about a deal broke, DST has seen a jump from $66 per share to $84 per share. This $18 premium works out to a $1.08 billion premium in actual dollar terms, equivalent to 7.2 times anticipated synergies as the combination really seems to become a better business as well on top of the costs synergies.Investors further take comfort in the strong dealmaking capabilities of SS&C which has acquired multiple companies in recent years and brought significant margin expansion to all of them. While some of these deals were smaller, the $2.6-billion purchase of Advent in 2015 was a relatively large deal. On a pro-forma basis, this makes that the company will more than 10x increase its sales in just about a decade's time, a huge achievement by any standards.Hence, shares of SS&C have seen a big jump as well, driven by reasonable multiples paid, promise for synergies and the prospects for becoming a stronger business. Shares of SS&C themselves have jumped from $42 to $50. Including the to-be-issued shares, the valuation of SS&C has jumped by $1.83 billion, actually far more than the premium paid for DST.The combined $2.9 billion increase in value cannot be explained by synergies alone. Applying a reasonable 12 times multiple to synergies (not accounting for time value of money before they are realised, and costs incurred to achieve those synergies), that could only explain $1.8 billion in value in a very optimistic calculation.Hence the market seems to understand that this deal makes the combined business stronger, but I cannot escape the feeling that the combined business is trading at relatively rich multiples. Including net debt, the business is valued at $18 billion following the transaction, as multiples are getting a bit rich to my taste.So while I congratulate all the management teams involved and the shareholders of both firms, I see no compelling reason to jump aboard as SS&C will be 5 times leveraged following this deal (not a big issue given the predictability of the business). The issue is that multiples become quite elevated, as I see no compelling reason to buy into the stock at these levels."
4141380,76785,2018-01-31T15:03:13-05:00,"SS&C Technologies has a great history of acquisition-driven growth, along with driving margin expansion within acquired businesses within financial technology.There is no reason to assume the most recent acquisition, DST Systems, will be any different. The size presents challenges, but it is hard to bet against management.Even adjusting for stock-based compensation, SS&C Technologies prints money. The recurring revenue model and high customer retention points to stability.","Coming from a background working at financial institutions both large and small, there isn’t anything more important to day-to-day functionality than the software. The flow of information and data that must be properly funneled to all stakeholders across financials is massive and complex and is an area of the market I believe is ripe for innovation. In many ways, companies providing this software make for much better investments than the banks themselves.SS&C Technologies (SSNC) is a prime example of this dynamic. While large bulge bracket investment banks and consumer-oriented firms largely house their information technology (“IT”) development in-house, smaller players in the financial services industry – registered investment advisors (“RIAs”), community banks, hedge funds, endowments – just do not have the capital to build this infrastructure out themselves. Even in some cases, larger entities (Morgan Stanley (MS), JPMorgan (JPM), Ares Management (ARES)) find reason to use SS&C Technologies products. Heightened regulatory requirements and a tough banking and trading environment have only deepened this need, and many are looking for independent vendors that can provide full service solutions.It’s a great business model. Once a customer is locked into the new ecosystem, they are locked in; retention rates at SS&C Technologies have long been above 95% on an annual basis (97% retention rate currently). Switching costs are enormous, and it isn’t unusual for many financial firms to still be using software product (with some updates) put into service way back in the 1990s. Heavy customer retention alongside the recurring revenue model (subscription/license fees) and low capital expenditures make cash flows easy to predict and stable. These are the types of businesses I love, and while there are concerns on the sustainability of the high EBITDA margins found here, I don’t believe investors will see much risk there. The major catalyst present – to either the upside or downside – over the next several years is the closure and integration of the recently announced acquisition of DST Systems. While the company has a history of successful integration and deleveraging major acquisitions, such as Advent Software in 2015 and GlobeOp in 2012, this will be the largest in the company’s history, and it will make or break the firm.The financial technology business is growing, but it is one where market participants have a tendency to carve out niches. Within these subsects of the market, a handful of firms generally have control. When investors think of the big players in the space – Cognizant (CTSH), Fiserv (FISV), Infosys Limited (INFY) – it is generally by revenue, and margins do not necessarily follow. All of these larger players have enterprise values more than three times what was found at legacy SS&C Technologies, but all of them post margins substantially lower despite the scale and operational leverage advantage. Adjusted EBITDA margin is consistently above 40% here, and that is in most cases 10-15% (or more) above large-cap peer averages using similar calculation methodology.Earning that type of margin is difficult, and requires building a solid base of business in the right space. Boosting the investment proposition, it isn’t just a case of “luck” or being in the right business at the right time. For instance, in fund administration (which was built out via the GlobeOp and Citi Alternative Investor Services acquisitions), SS&C Technologies has gone from being a non-existent player to the top administrator by assets under administration (“AUA”): $1,483B. The margin profile today is so much better than what was present at GlobeOp which formed the major base of the business here ($800mm acquisition), so management clearly has had great success in creating opportunity to a degree where other large-scale players could not. This is all done in many cases while competing against large banking peers with internally developed systems (State Street, Bank of New York Mellon, Northern Trust). It takes a great company with a nimble management team to outmaneuver these firms which have substantially higher available capital.This type of specialization brings with it risks. More than half of 2017 revenue is set to come from alternative assets: hedge funds, private equity, real estate, fund administration. Deeper still, more than 80% will come from that group, plus insurance companies, REITs, and pension funds (“institutions”). By and large, revenue sourced from other avenues, such as private wealth management and RIAs, as well as research shops and the government via municipal finance, is just a drop in the bucket. This has long been a heavy cross that SS&C Technologies has borne and likely has led to substantial market pessimism. Despite the current high margins, everyone expects the end of the world for these companies. The new reality of passive investing has hurt both alternative asset managers and to a lesser extent institutional management, at least if viewed by the lens of the financial press. The so-called “2 and 20” model of hedge funds does appear to be on the way out, and with most of the financial sector struggling with profitability, many wonder whether services companies can really continue to extract 40% EBITDA margin off of firms that have struggled to earn real economic returns.I think the risks here are vastly, vastly overstated. While there was a period where hedge funds saw net outflows early in 2016, that has since corrected, and the expectation is for hedge fund assets under management (“AUM”) to set another all-time high this year, recording ten straight years of gains coming off the Great Recession. While the bull run in the equity markets likely has contributed to AUM, particularly among hedge funds that take an activist or leveraged long role, I don’t think we should discount that as a group, hedge funds have seen uncorrelated returns with the market. They are “hedge” funds after all, and certain types (long/short, short only, etc.) have seen outflows and lower returns. The current bull market run can’t last forever, and EBITDA is going to be much more resilient here versus other financial plays I’ve owned and traded in the past (such as active equity/fixed income managers like Legg Mason (LM)). When annual returns in the broader market taper off, I expect a renaissance in active management and hedge fund AUM.Widely speculated, the acquisition of DST Systems for $5,400mm is a game changer. The acquisition multiple is roughly 11.7x EV/EBITDA based on trailing twelve-month results from DST Systems as reported, 8.8x including the $150mm in guided synergies. Keep in mind both companies exclude stock-based compensation from adjusted EBITDA calculations, and I’m a firm believer in treating this expense as a real and recurring expense equivalent to cash outlay. The exact details of the financing side of this transaction (debt maturity, secured/unsecured, coupons, etc.) is not out yet, but management has stated that this deal will be funded by a combination of debt and equity financing. The secondary equity component is expected to be around between $500-1,000mm, which will help with pro-forma leverage given that will be above 5x at close. Likely driving the equity issuance, the company currently has a covenant requirement that leverage not exceed 5.25x, so unless that is amended that is the upper bound. The acquisition should close by Q3 2018.Strategically, the deal makes a lot of sense. DST Systems provides proprietary technology-based information processing and servicing solutions to both Financial Services and Healthcare, and that Healthcare business will be an excellent form of diversification for the company. Like SS&C Technologies, recurring revenue is in excess of 90%, and the average client tenure is nearly two decades. Products include some overlap into asset manager and brokerage solutions, a great retirement products business, and the healthcare arm. Income streams will be diversified, as beyond the healthcare diversification, exposure to wealth management will see an uptick as well. This should boost perception, and I believe the market will reward the firm on a consolidated basis for having less exposure to alternative assets and institutional clients.On the negative side, a large portion of the DST Systems operation is comprised of lower margin products aimed at providing backoffice functionality (shareholder recordkeeping, client portals, reporting, account servicing), which is better known as business process outsourcing (“BPO”). BPO doesn’t carry with it a lot of brand cache, and it is a much more competitive business. As a result, despite anticipated cost synergies, the acquisition will dilute consolidated EBITDA margin. I also expect organic revenue growth to lag that of the legacy business, so on the net, the combined company is going to lose some of its high growth, high margin luster. Taking the glass half full view, there is ample opportunity for improvement. Management can and will bring their expertise in automation and higher-end solutions to improving these products, which could drive EBITDA margin (currently low to mid 20%) at the acquired business higher over the next several years.On the risk front, management must integrate a combined workforce of more than 25,000 employees, many of which are performing mission-critical solutions for customers. The revenue base is sticky, but it also can ill afford mistakes; customers can and will walk if issues put reputation on the line. I’m not too worried. Bolstering the prospects of the deal, this isn’t the first time SS&C Technologies has worked with DST Systems. In 2014, the company acquired DST Global, the (relatively) tiny EMEA and AsiaPac business of DST Systems, for $95mm in cash in 2014. This means that both management teams have already worked together to some extent in the past, and it is likely that CEO William Stone has a better core understanding of what he is acquiring versus if they were going in dark. This isn’t his first acquisition rodeo; the company has bought more than a dozen firms over the course of its history.The management team also isn’t a stranger to leverage. SS&C Technologies was taken private in 2005 via leveraged buy-out (“LBO”) buy Carlyle Group and the management team at 6.8x net debt/EBITDA, and after the initial public offering (“IPO”) in 2010 and subsequent follow-on offering a year later, that leverage was down to 1.5x. GlobeOp was acquired in 2012, catapulting leverage to 4.2x, but that marker was back down to 1.5x three years later. That’s a proven track record of being able to navigate having a levered balance sheet and, perhaps more importantly, actually paying it down and driving margin improvement.I expect $1,285mm in adjusted EBITDA for the combined entity next year on a pro forma basis (remember Q3 2018 close). I don’t believe SS&C Technologies will have any issue pricing $1,000mm in equity at a reasonable rate near current equity prices. Based on that expectation, the combined enterprise value based on $4,400mm in additional debt is going to be roughly $16,850mm as the company sits today. Back of the envelope math puts SS&C Technology trading at 13x EV/EBITDA on a pro forma basis for 2018.Interest expense will run about $370mm per year, assuming the company prices new debt at 6% on average. That doesn’t seem like a lofty goal, as the 2023 Senior Notes that were issued in the middle of 2015 priced at 5.875% and those notes trade well above par. Assuming $100mm in taxes (lighter due to much higher depreciation and amortization rates versus actual capital expenditure outlay) and $150mm in capital expenditures, free cash flow is in the neighborhood of $590mm once adding back stock-based compensation expense as well ($75mm estimate). Given management has targeted 0.7x leverage reduction annually, a large portion of which will come from debt paydown versus growth, it seems I’m on the same page with the company’s top brass.The market looks to be pricing the company at 5.8% pro forma free cash flow yield today, which is more than reasonable in my view. Historically, the company has traded at a significant premium to those levels (20%), although with substantially less leverage. DST Systems has traded at similar ranges despite the difference in margin profiles. If management can hit reasonable targets (5% consolidated organic growth, achieve the $150mm in synergy targets, drive margin improvement in the acquired business), there is a great case for upside for the company’s shares today. It hasn’t paid to bet against SS&C Technologies in the past based on deal integration, and the relative lack of short interest despite the upcoming leverage increase points to the market agreeing.Thank you for reading this Seeking Alpha PRO article.

4195801,101421,2018-08-07T13:28:46-04:00,SS&C has announced its intent to acquire Eze Software for $1.45 billion in cash.Eze Software provides operations software for investment management firms.SSNC is taking on significant debt to fund the deal; it will need to use cash flow from operations to reduce its debt load and interest expense.,"SS&C (SSNC) has announced it has agreed to acquire Eze Software from TPG Capital for $1.45 billion.Eze Software has developed investment management software solutions.SSNC is taking on still more debt to fund the deal which promises to provide a big piece in its suite of investment software to institutions of all sizes.Boston, Massachusetts-based Eze Software was founded in 1995 to build solutions capable of maximizing results across different segments of an enterprise, from portfolio analytics and modeling to compliance and regulatory reporting, trade order management and execution, commission management, operations, and portfolio management and investor accounting.Management is headed by President and CEO Jeffrey Shoreman, who has been with the firm since 1999 and was previously Technology Consultant at Accenture.Below is a brief overview video of the Eze investment suite benefits:(Source: Eze Software)Eze Software’s primary offerings for its Eze Investment Suite include:The firm claims to have more than 2,500 customers worldwide, of which 1,800 are buy-side firms.According to a 2018 market research report by Radiant Insight, the global investment management software market has reached $2.4 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow to $5.9 billion by 2025.This represents a strong CAGR of 14.51% between 2017 and 2025.The market that is developing the fastest is in the Asia-Pacific area, especially China and India.Major competitive vendors that provide investment management software services include:SS&C disclosed the acquisition price as $1.45 billion in an all-cash deal which will be funded with a combination of existing cash and term loan debt.The firm didn’t disclose a change in financial guidance; Eze Software generated revenues of $280 million in 2017, for a Price/Sales multiple of approximately 5.2x. EBITDA was $105 million for the most recent year.SS&C said to expect $30 million per year in cost synergies by 2021 and that the transaction ‘is expected to be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings per share.’ Management typically uses ‘adjusted’ figures vs. GAAP when they want a deal to look better to investors.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing as of March 31, 2018, indicates that the firm had $74 million in cash and equivalents long-term debt of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $2.7 billion.The deal is a significant acquisition for SS&C and the firm will take on another large amount of debt to add to its current debt load.Interest expense already takes a big chunk out of earnings, so the debt load needs to be reduced by management as quickly as possible. In Q1 2018, the firm generated $70 million in cash flow from operations, so it will need to devote much of that cash flow to debt reduction.SS&C is acquiring Eze Software to help its clients improve their investment operationsAs the firm stated in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, SSNC’s stock price has appreciated in value by 47% as the chart below indicates:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)Since the deal announcement, the stock has bounced 5.2%, so public investors appear to like the announcement despite the increased debt load the firm will assume to close the transaction.SS&C’s clients not only use software to make better investments, but they want software to help them continuously improve their internal organizational efficiencies.The Eze deal provides another important piece for SS&C’s full suite of offerings for all facets of investment management, operations, and reporting.The acquisition isn’t cheap and is a major move by SS&C management to broaden their offerings to serve the entire investment process.As long as management can reduce its debt load with operational cash flow, the deal should accrue benefits to shareholders over the medium-term."
4001172,48501,2016-08-22T03:16:07-04:00,"The scope for continued acquired growth has substantially diminished.
        A period of deleveraging has begun.
        The shares are fairly valued by the market.","SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC) is a provider of software products and software-enabled services that allow financial services providers to automate complex business processes and effectively manage their information processing requirements. SSNC's 10,000+ clients globally consist of institutional asset and wealth managers, alternative investment managers, financial advisory firms and financial institutions. The company provides products and services in the portfolio management and accounting, trading and treasury operations, client reporting, financial modeling, loan management and accounting, property management, money market processing, software-enabled services, professional services and product support markets.SSNC's revenue from these products is expected to grow from $768 million in FY14 to $1.4 billion in FY16. Sales growth has been driven primarily by the acquisitions of Citigroup AIS, Primatics, Varden and Advent. These acquisitions in addition to contributing sales have also resulted in a material decline in profitability. The net income margin is expected to decline from 17% in 2014 to 7% in 2016, including cost cutting measure implemented by SSNC's leadership team. While SSNC is expected to continue its cost cutting measures to bring operating expenses closer to 2014 levels, I don't see the return on equity exceeding any reasonable investor's cost of equity through 2018.The aforementioned acquisitions were in part funded by the use of debt. Given the current level of financial leverage, I don't see SSNC being able to make another significant acquisition that is funded by financial leverage through at least 2017 and possibly 2018. Excluding a significant and pricey equity offering, SSNC will likely rely on organic growth, cost cutting, and smaller acquisitions to drive financial performance through FY18.The balance of risk is to the downside and could be driven by weak organic growth, ineffective cost cutting measures, and/or an equity offering. On the upside, SSNC could become a takeover target for a company looking to bolster its offerings in the financial services space.With SSNC priced at 66x FY16 GAAP EPS and 4.5x FY16 GAAP RPS, SSNC is trading at its intrinsic value. The growth outlook for the next two fiscal years is mid-single digits; that kind of growth doesn't command a 6x RPS or 7x RPS multiple. Simply stated, the current period of total return underperformance is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and consequently SSNC is an investment that should be underweight.Acquired Growth Turns OrganicThe aforementioned acquisitions are expected to lead to sales that doubled between FY14 and the end of FY17. Sales grew while continuing to be primary composed of re-occurring revenue. Over 90% of SSNC's total revenue comes from re-occurring transactions, with software-enabled services contributing 65% of sales and 28% of sales coming from maintenance and term licenses. Perpetual licenses represent 2% of revenue and professional services are 5% of revenue.Courtesy of Morningstar and Bottom Up InvestingFor FY16, I'm expecting revenue growth of 40% up from 30% in FY15. Profitability during FY16 should be better than FY15 as management further integrates the acquired companies and reduces operating expenses as a percentage of revenue; I expect an operating margin of 19% for FY16 versus 17% for FY15.Turning to FY17, I expect revenue growth to decline to 7% and operating income to increase 19% as management continues to reduce operating expenditure as a percentage of revenue. Expense reduction combined with a decline in interest expense is anticipated to drive EPS growth of 47%, which is down from 107% during FY16. The return on equity is expected to be in the mid-single digits during FY16 and FY17.Courtesy of Morningstar and Bottom Up InvestingI expect management to continue to decrease SSNC's debt level as a percentage total assets with the ratio falling to the low 40s. The financial leverage ratio is forecasted to fall to 2.54 at the end of FY16 from 2.76 at the end of FY15 with deleveraging continuing through FY17. Additionally, SSNC is expected to continue to make acquisitions that are less significant while shareholders' equity continues to increase.Courtesy of Morningstar and Bottom Up InvestingThe cash flows are highlighted by the resumption of growth of cash flow from operations and free cash flow, the paying off of debt, and the continuing of acquisitions. I expect management to spend about $300 million on acquisitions during FY17 and FY18. Free cash flow should grow from $229 million in FY16 to $313 million in FY18. Additionally, there is enough capital for the dividend to continue being increased, but I don't see share repurchases occurring through at least FY18.Valuations and Relative StrengthCourtesy of Morningstar and Bottom Up InvestingBased on forecasted 2016 GAAP EPS of $0.48 and the current share price, SSNC is trading at a 104% premium to the Nasdaq; the F P/E is adversely impacted by the acquisitions that have yet to be fully integrated. Given the noise in the P/E valuation, I used the P/S multiple, and with SSNC trading at 4.45x FY16 RPS, SSNC is valued fairly by the market. The company is a mid-single digit grower and consequently doesn't deserve a 6x or 7x sales multiple. Given the current valuation, the YTD relative underperformance is expected to persist."
3488486,54942,2015-09-04T14:12:30-04:00,Synergy continues to appear conservative with the real benefits of the acquisition not appearing through the P/L until the back half of this year and first half of next..Advent was much less efficiently run than SS&C so there remains significant opportunity for them to expand Advent's margins to that of SS&C..The company remains a de-leveraging story with more potential acquisitions highly likely over the next two quarters. .,"SS&C Technologies (NASDAQ:SSNC) was our top idea back in early February after they made an offer for Advent Software. The deal passed regulatory hurdles in mid-June and closed in early July. Following that deal, the company made another acquisition purchasing Citi's fund administration business. The shares are nearly halfway to our target price of $83 (they were much closer prior to the global equity sell-off) and we think the back half of this year should produce the synergy and outperformance necessary to get there.We think the shares are still in the early innings of their growth story as multiple dynamics are at play to partially cloud the picture going forward. However, we are fairly confident that synergies will appear much better than their original forecast given the spreads between the margins of the target and acquirer.Synergy Should Drive Shares Higher As Guidance Is ConservativeOperating margins continue to improve as they realize both cost synergies and increased top line growth. Management now expects to achieve above the $12 million of synergy over the next two quarters solely from the Advent acquisition and an increase in adjusted operating margins to between 39% and 39.5% in the third quarter with further improvement in the fourth.Current guidance suggests that there may be significant upside to the shares as it is simply an aggregation of SS&C and Advent's prior, separate expectations (minus a few small adjustments). We think the company is still significantly understating the potential accretion of the deal, especially as we progress throughout 2016. Management has been slightly opaque in their disclosures of the progress of the integration since their presentation in February.Advent was a far more inefficient than SS&C with EBITDA margins some 1200 bps lower. We are a user of Advent's products and would have to concur with the market sentiment that the company is not run efficiently nor optimally. We see significant potential for the company to eliminate substantial overhead from the Advent operations over the next year and boost Advent EBITDA margins much closer to that of SS&C's.We see the synergies coming from four to five areas. The first is the elimination of public company costs, which have become exorbitant in recent years due to regulatory scrutiny. That alone will achieve several million dollars of annual savings for the company. Second is facility consolidation with several high-priced office spaces in Boston, New York, and London where there exists common locations between the two firms. Then is there is the other low-hanging fruit of overlapping finance, marketing, development, and general and administrative departments. Lastly, there is the large opportunity in professional services margins, which Advent runs at break-even but SS&C runs at approximately 30% to 35%. If they can get Advent's professional services margins to that of SS&C, it would equate to millions of additional EBITDA generation.Meanwhile, the firm has been training the Advent sales force on SS&C products while SS&C's sales force is being trained on Advent's products. As we detailed in our prior write-up, the product lines are extremely complementary allowing for significant up-sell and cross-selling opportunity. We believe this could start materializing in the first quarter next year as sales personnel go back to existing customers and offer the new products in a packaged offering. This same scenario occurred when they purchased DST Global Solutions back in December. Since the purchase, they have already accelerated their top line growth achieving 16% yoy revenue increases but have also expanded their operating margins significantly.But there is a slight offset to this bullish case as the equity offering was larger than expected increasing the dilution effect. The company increased the equity offering to over 12.1 million shares and $740 million ($718 million net). They also increased their senior note offering from $500 million to $600 million. Management stated that the extra cash will be used for general corporate purposes including acquisition and integration costs. The added shares could impact fiscal 2016 depending on the timing of any potential acquisition that may happen or where they use the funds.Large Client Wins Boost Second QuarterThe fiscal second quarter results were better than the Street had expected with revenue up 12.9% yoy to $213 million. Two drivers were responsible for the growth including the acceleration of DST's Global Solutions business which added approximately $18 million to revenue. The other was several large deal wins with the firm stealing share from their competition. Gross margins were also ahead of expectations at 59.5%, up 210 bps from the year ago quarter. The outperformance there is mainly from their higher share of license revenue and not from the synergies, which leaves that on the table for future quarters.The strong gross margins offset some higher SG&A expenses due to the integration costs. However, those higher costs are likely to roll off in the near term as the company sheds redundancies in the two operations. Management called out several large wins in the quarter that are going to ramp in the next few quarters and drive the top line. They noted that many of them came from prime competitors and were crediting their improved sales force for driving some of these new clients. We think this could continue over the next several quarters as the sales forces are integrated fully and cross/up-sell their combined product offerings.Deleveraging and Acquisition StoryWe were surprised by the amount of debt pay down in the quarter, amounting to $279 million since Q2 2014 and $174 million over the first six months this year. The balance sheet is in much better shape than we expected coming out of the recent acquisitions, partly due to the increased equity and debt offering. Interest expense should be down significantly on an annual run-rate starting in the current quarter.We think this balance sheet health will give them substantial added flexibility to continue their growth strategy bent on strategic acquisitions, both complementary and supplementary, to their current product offerings. Management hinted that the added capital from the debt and equity raise are likely to be used for more acquisitions although no specific opportunity was detailed. However, given the cost of raising equity and debt, we find it unlikely that they will use it to pay down debt on debt they just raised- a largely inefficient operation.ValuationWe believe the Advent acquisition will be substantially accretive over the next year with the potential for further re-rating to the upside given the significant potential. We expect EBITDA to DOUBLE off of the fiscal 2014 base of $300 million by fiscal 2016. Some of that expected re-rating has already occurred with the EV/EBITDA ratio rising to 21x on a ttm basis on the expectation of some of that significant boost in profitability. We still believe the shares are undervalued at current levels and that the risks are to the upside as they are likely to outperform their synergy forecasts.Our forecasts still call for an increase in EBITDA margins in fiscal 2016 to at least 45% and likely higher. But a large part of our valuation is on the large decline in net debt compared to our previous forecast due to the larger equity and debt offering. Net debt is likely to be the largest question going into next year due to the potential for more acquisitions. Currently, net debt is approximately $1.95 billion with the added cash. The company has several small debt tranches due over the next couple of years with the two main chunks not due until 2020 and 2023.Our valuation thoughts have improved on the back of a higher expected multiple- by 0.5x- but also due to much lower net debt levels. This of course could change if the company makes a large acquisition that will lever up the balance sheet. An acquisition is likely by year-end but we don't think a large one on the order of Advent is highly probable.ConclusionSS&C is on their way to becoming a large financial software powerhouse with substantial long-term opportunity to grow with their current offering. We believe accretion is likely to be much better than management and the sell-side are currently thinking given how inefficient Advent is run compared to SS&C. We increased our target price on the back of lower net debt than expected but we think that it is likely to eventually be offset by one or more acquisitions that re-lever the balance sheet. We are still very bullish on the shares despite the 16% rise since our last article as we think there is much more upside to go."

At the risk of oversimplification, the company provides software to financial institutions, enabling them to integrate certain non-discretionary front/middle/back-office functions, drastically improving work efficiency. Asset management firms (whether independent or created in-house within larger financial institutions) are generally required to report, reconcile and measure their performance on a regular basis. Suffice to say, reporting gets very messy if the front office (trading) is not integrated with the middle- and back-office. SSNC provides proprietary solutions which streamline this process, which is a tremendous value-add to financial institutions.The company makes money on a subscription basis by entering into multi-year contracts (ranging from one to five years) with asset management firms. These contracts are renewable annually. Considering the mission-critical nature of the company's solutions, and the fact that its solutions are deeply embedded within its customer workflows (front/middle/back-office), customer retention is extremely high (90%+ in FY14). Thus, one can be meaningfully assured that demand would remain stable in almost any economic environment.Significant barriers to entry ensure a sustained degree of competitive advantageThis segment (software provider to AM firms) of the industry experiences significant barriers to entry. Not only would a new entrant be required to spend tens of millions developing software equivalent to an incumbent's offerings, software development would take many years. Further, due to the deeply-embedded nature of these solutions, it would be nearly impossible to convince customers to switch to an alternate provider. Additionally, even if a new entrant is able to take market share, it would have to operate at a loss for many years before it achieves scale on recurring subscriptions. Clearly, life is all well and good for the incumbent.In a nutshell, we have a business that:Of course, qualitative discussion is all well and good, but the numbers need to back up the narrative. And they do. EBITDA margins have consistently been around the 40% range, while average retention rates were in excess of 90% of the last half decade.Without a doubt, a great business. But is it trading at a fair price? I will determine this later.Advent acquisition is business as usualOn 2 February, SSNC announced the acquisition of Advent Software (NASDAQ:ADVS). By all accounts, ADVS is a very SSNC-like business. Both players provide similarly mission-critical software to asset management firms, enjoy significant barriers to entry, and highly-recurring revenue streams over many years. However, according to SSNC's management, there's not much overlap between SSNC and ADVS offerings. Thus, the combination of both firms is likely to result in significant cross-selling opportunities across their respective clientele.In addition, SSNC has experience in the cloud delivery model (some of its software is deployed on the cloud) while ADVS primarily deals with on-premise software. The advantages of a cloud delivery model are undeniable, and SSNC's cloud expertise should allow ADVS to transit to a more attractive SaaS model.SSNC has made many acquisitions in the past (40 to date), and hence it is vital to ensure that management is not going trigger-happy with M&A. The ideal scenario would be for management to acquire firms that adopt a similar modus operandi compared to the existing business. This ensures that management does in fact have the relevant expertise to run the combined firm. Considering the fact that ADVS is a business very similar to SSNC, this acquisition proves that management is not straying out of its area of expertise.SSNC plans to fund the $3.4b acquisition with $3b in debt and $400m in equity. Clearly, one bone of contention investors would have is the combined firm's debt load. Pro-forma, assuming $500m in annual EBITDA (incl. cost synergies), this gives the company a net debt to EBITDA of about 5.3x. This is a massive debt balance by any measure. However, I submit that the combined firm should be able to pay off its liabilities without much difficulty. Management has mentioned that it intends to focus heavily on deleveraging in the next few years. Considering that the combined firm generates annuity-like cash flow streams year after year, the deleveraging is likely to be successful.Enormous upside potential from current levels, with greater upside if valued at market-clearing multiplesAs seen above, FY15 revenue and EBITDA are expected to come in at around $1.2b and $500m respectively. The 60% jump in the top-line is largely due to the addition of revenue from the ADVS acquisition. Beyond FY15, the top-line of the combined firm is expected to grow at double-digits - 15% in FY16 and 10% thereafter. This double-digit revenue growth will be driven largely by cross-selling over both (SSNC and ADVS) customer bases and increased market penetration (as a result of a greater market presence) among asset management firms (whether traditional AMs, hedge funds, or private equity firms). EBITDA margins are expected to come in at 41% for FY15, expanding to 45% at the end of the five-year projection period as the combined firm realizes increased operating leverage and cost synergies over time. Normally, I'll be hesitant in assigning any value toward the realization of synergies (whether revenue or cost). However, SSNC's proven track record (40 acquisitions to date) in achieving these synergies have certainly swayed my decision.My model implies 88% upside potential from current levels. Actual upside potential is likely to be far greater if we consider the fact that I have used a 15x multiple in my calculations, while SSNC currently trades at a far greater multiple (19x-20x). I believe that my low-balling of the valuation multiple only serves to emphasize the sheer amount of upside potential in SSNC.Downside potential is limited, heads you win, tails you still winThe above model illustrates a bearish scenario. It assumes zero revenue and cost synergies and no margin expansion stemming from operating leverage. FY15 40% growth in revenue reflects a simple addition of revenue from both firms. Beyond FY15, growth rates are assumed to be more or less in line with historical numbers. EBITDA margins are assumed to be stagnant over the projection period as well. Although such a scenario is highly unlikely if we look at management's track record, I posit that it is still important to consider the potential for downside. As seen above, even with extremely bearish assumptions, SSNC still possesses modest upside potential (20%) from current levels. Heads you win, tails you still win.I opine that the reason for the market anomaly is due to:Sell-side coverage should increase over time, especially if a rate hike occurs in the near-term, resulting in a market correction and a flight to safety. Currently, the market seems to favor pure-play big data, cybersecurity and the cloud (evident from their stratospheric valuation multiples), while ignoring boring industries such as the one SSNC is operating in. After all, providing software that integrates the front/middle/back office is not very exciting. Deal uncertainty is unwarranted if one considers the fact that SSNC has been very successful in performing such deals for years - acquisitions have generally resulted in strong top-line growth and steady margin expansion. I highly doubt either party would back out at the last minute.I expect the price-value disparity to converge within 18 months, with the Fed's anticipated rate hike (late-2015/early 2016) and increased sell-side coverage acting as significant catalysts. The rate hike should result in a significant revaluation of the market, hence driving investors toward stocks that are generally safer and more resilient. SSNC is an attractive candidate in such a situation. Not only does the company's defensive end market exposure mitigate cyclicality, its fabled cash flow conversion (FCF is 70% of EBITDA) offers solid FCF yields (7%) even at market-clearing multiples (19x-20x EBITDA). Furthermore, as I have detailed earlier, the potential for upside is enormous while the potential for downside is limited. At current trading levels, the market is essentially valuing SSNC as a zero-growth perpetuity ($500m in EBITDA / 0.1 = $5b in EV), which is obviously absurd. Additionally, if I think of businesses that I would like to own in this environment, where equities as a whole are at all-time highs, under-covered companies with stable demand drivers in any economic environment would definitely be my first choice. SSNC is one such business."

The company in addition to software products offers operations and accounting services to alternative fund managers including hedge fund and private equity funds.SSNC has been a high flyer over the last 52 weeks with shares up more than 50%. The company initiated its first dividend and has grown earnings over the same period. While the company has executed well, we believe the pace and quality of recent acquisitions leave the shares overvalued.SSNC data by YChartsSSNC has made several acquisitions in its recent past including GlobeOp, Advent Software and most recently announced the purchase of Citi's Alternative Investment Servicing business. SSNC purchased Advent for $2.6 Billion in total considerations. Advent was well known for its Geneva portfolio accounting systems utilized by many of the leading alternative funds and fund services providers. One key area of concern is Advent's touted dominance of the fund administration market, which SSNC competes with many of the existing Advent clients. These clients are likely to be concerned given not only SSNC's purchase of GlobeOp but also Citi (NYSE:C) Hedge Fund services that will make it the largest such provider in the space. Looking at the industries league tables large Advent customers such as JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM), SEI (NASDAQ:SEIC), and numerous second tier players are likely to be concerned. According to a Waters Technology article Advent competitors indicated SSNC paid more than twice what others would be willing to pay.While the Advent acquisition had some synergies given GlobeOps reliance on the platform and SSNC's own position in the space the recent Citi acquisition is a head scratcher. C had been rumored for some time to be shopping the business including a move of the business into its Bad Bank framework. The lengthy time has been rumored to make the existing clients subject to poaching by competitors, not the least bit has been fueled by their refusal to update legal table numbers since the acquisition. In the same Waters technology article no one is really sure what SSNC is buying here. Industry publication Hedgeweek shortly after Citi's intention to exist the business was announced was quoting industry sources calling the Citi book the ""old hag"" and wondering if their was any value at all. The top Citi clients have already solicited request for proposals (RFPs) from other competitors so SSNC is going to find itself defending the client base for the ones that remain by the time the transaction closes. Many of these clients may be throwing in the towel given Citi itself bought the business by acquiring BISYS, who itself consolidated several small players.The acquisitions likely played a part in SSNC's recent trip to the equity markets to raise additional capital selling a substantial number of shares to raise process of more than $700 million according to the company's 10-Q.Final ThoughtsSSNC will be under pressure to execute flawlessly on their recent acquisitions particularly as the share count as increased and is likely to dilute shareholders on a per share basis. This will be a tough mountain to climb given the above acquisitions face challenges from client attrition, uncertainty and in the case of many of the longstanding Citi clients a transition to yet another provider. Given the execution risk and run-up in the stock we recommend selling the shares."

(NASDAQ:SSNC) is a software provider and software-enabled servicer for the financial services industry. It provides third-party software-enabled front/middle office services as well as back-office functions such as accounting and reporting for a variety of financial services clients such as multinational banks, retail banks, hedge funds, hedge fund of funds, private equity, family offices, credit unions, broker/dealers, institutional money managers, insurance companies, property managers, commercial lenders, financial exchanges and real estate lenders. The company operates across six continents with its headquarters in Windsor, Connecticut. SSNC is considered the leading provider of such third-party services, and continues to expand primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as organic growth. Although you will find it categorized as a technology/software provider, SSNC is primarily a financial services play. Its subsidiary, SS&C GlobeOp, operates what now has become one of the world's largest administrators for the Asset Management Industry.Value Of Business Model And ServicesSSNC breaks out its revenue according to 4 categories: Software Enabled Services, Software Licenses, Maintenances and Professional Services. More than 60% of its revenue derives from the company's services department. As third-party administrators, its business has a relatively stable demand curve as all asset managers require these types of services as a ""check and balance"" against their own internal records and models. Each segment really supports the overall services component of the company's business model. Having spent three years reviewing reports many times coming from SS&C GlobeOp, I can attest to the level of sophistication in relation to other firms the company offers its clients, and only expect that to significantly increase in value with its recent purchase of Advent Software (NASDAQ:ADVS) and its Advent Geneva platform (one of the most common and comprehensive platforms in financial services). Advent produces over 100M in quarterly revenue across 4,500 customers located all over the world. This acquisition will surely be a game changer for both SSNC and the industry.Notable Hedge Funds Continue to InvestNumerous well-known fund managers have invested in SSNC since its IPO and continue to own the company. Among those notable Asset Managers listed are D.E. Shaw, Tudor Investment, Visium, Citadel, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management, Janus Capital (NYSE:JNS), Wellington, Two Sigma, TIAA-CREF Investment Management, as well as large mutual fund managers T. Rowe Price, Vanguard and Fidelity, all among the large list of prominent names backing their opinions with their investment capital. The above list is a very compelling and bullish testament of quality in the company's business model, service quality and future growth potential.Below are some of the ways SSNC's services provide real economic value besides providing a side-by-side set of books and ""number crunching.""Operational Efficiency, Accuracy in Value and ComplianceThe value these services provide both the business (hedge fund) and the investor are essential for successful operations and execution in today's complex global capital markets. They increase operational efficiency, accuracy of reported values, analytical capabilities, compliance, reporting requirements, and solutions for complex trading strategies across every type of strategy and product that exists. The front/middle office services, both in software and consultancy, effectively enhance the decision-making process for PMs, traders and analysts through increased transparency and timely information on a day-to-day, month-to-month, or any other time constrained basis. This also allows funds to keep headcount at bay as efficiencies are realized and costs in turn are lowered. With the addition of Advent's Geneva software to the platform, now SSNC can become fully integrated with a large majority of its clients' platforms, increasing the efficiency curve further than anyone else's capabilities in the market.On the investor side of the equation, the level of accuracy related to complex credit and derivative instruments used by hedge funds is highly increased through SSNC's top-of-the-line software and services. Securities that have fair value categorized as Level 2 or Level 3 will have a smaller probability and spread from their true values, which is something investors surely appreciate and often require (large clients often require a firm to work with a very short list of approved vendors both on the Audit and Administration side). This is especially important for Private Equity and Venture Capital firms, with valuations that cannot easily be quoted and in turn are usually relying on a variety of valuation models, valuation services (independent of both the auditor and administrator), and a variety of other techniques (such as different broker quotes) to arrive at a reasonable fair value (accurate ""Net Asset Value"" NAV).In addition to the above, the services also greatly enhance the firm's capability of accurately tracking complex fund structures and investment strategies (Offshore Master Feeder structures, Structured Credit Strategies, SPVs, side pocket investments, etc.), which is really all an investor and a client are concerned about at the end of the day.After scandals like Madoff, institutional investors have zero tolerance and expect nothing but top-line firms conducting the due diligence and assurance services, ensuring they can sleep at night in terms of both fraud and inherent human risk. Going forward, with increased regulation, one can see how important compliance measures (ex. of new items such as Form PF) and expenses (expense ratios) will be in an era with a variety of choices for investment vehicles constantly innovating to drive down cost and achieve superior relative performance.Client Retention is HighOne characteristic I find important for considering an investment is how many substitute products or services exist, and if the barriers to entry allow for competition to make it a costly item to retain clients (customers). I prefer businesses where they can focus on growth more than focusing on retaining clients. Fortunately for SSNC, client retention remains very high (<90%). One downside to the business is that a large majority of revenue is closely tied to a small number of clients due to fees generally being charged as a percentage of NAV. Whenever you have that kind of revenue or customer structure, you are always exposed to both the inherent risk of your clients' going concern as well as substitute services (losing the client). We will touch upon more risks later.The reason client retention remains strong besides high-quality products/services and execution is simply the hassle and institutional investor scrutiny when a fund changes the service provider. Building a strong relationship and benefiting from a reduction in operating costs and increase in efficiency is a process that takes significant time between the client and the firm, so switching services really isn't worth it unless expectations aren't being met. Yes, to an extent fees matter, but they are usually based off NAV, which is rather a standard rate across the industry with of course some exceptions with respect to the complexity of the funds' strategy and structure. Furthermore, investors always see red flags when a fund downsizes. In many cases, institutional investors only invest in funds with a very select list of service providers to ensure the highest standards.Management Strategy And Forward OutlookI could go into great detail and list out a variety of various products and services acquired while going through each individual client category and describing the value-added features, but investors can easily obtain that information through the company's 2014 10-K and Q2 2015 10-Q, as well as its investor relations segment of its website. Instead, I will go ahead and begin going over the figures and performance SSNC has seen since its 2011 IPO. Instead, more importantly, I will address a couple key concerns about client and talent attrition related to both the Citi Fund Services, and Advent Software acquisitions (acquisition costs of $450M and $2.6B) respectively.Client and Talent AttritionTalentAs mentioned earlier, switching service providers often raises red flags, especially downsizing, as SSNC has grown to be one of the largest along with Citco, State Street (NYSE:STT) and Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS) administrators in the industry. The company's business structure is a very flat pyramid, exactly the same way any public accounting or investment banking firm's models run. College graduates compete for spots at the big firms, most the time knowing that they are only there temporary, in order to gain valuable experience to leverage onto the ""private side,"" which often pays better with less brutal hours. It's the same scenario for investment banking programs that feed talent to private equity funds and other asset management roles. Administrators often are another stop on the career track to ultimately end up in the middle/back office of a hedge fund. Candidates are highly regarded when possessing a couple years in each area, as the prospective employer (the hedge fund's CFO) knows they essentially have been trained and molded on someone else's dime and time. So attrition is never an issue as new talent is always waiting to replace the old. This also keeps salary expenses rather stable, making cost management easier for SSNC. The idea that over expansion at this point for a firm the size of SSNC would cause unusual levels of employee turnover is unrealistic.ClientsClient retention, as mentioned earlier, is expected to remain high for a variety of reasons. The services provided aren't very different firm to firm, but SSNC's purchase of one of the industry's largest platforms, Advent Geneva software, will allow it to tailor its solutions even more closely to its clients' as it is essentially just as responsible as management is for the accuracy of the financial statements. Although the work may be the same, quality highly varies among competitors. It takes little analysis to also realize how beneficial the analytical and consulting side of the services will improve when running on the same platform. If anything, the $2.6 billion paid for Advent, and the $450M paid for Citi Group's department, will add to the top and bottom while cutting out expenses in the middle. Many times acquisitions are the only way to achieve high levels of growth in an established industry like asset management. I can speak from personal experience that clients care more about the relationship with the service provider than shopping around to save a few thousand dollars while having to recreate that relationship from the ground up. All the synergies developed on both the client and service provider's end are lost if this occurs. As for the price paid, nobody can really assess whether it's fair until we see how well the numbers reflect this in the future. At this point it would be pure speculation.Integration of Various AcquisitionsFinally, investors have expressed concern that significant acquisitions, partially funded by a secondary offering completed last quarter, may lead to liquidity issues and write-downs in the future if the firm cannot capitalize on them. The additional debt load also will become burdensome for the same reason. I tend to disagree with that thought process.Even though there is significant merit and logic behind these concerns, the likelihood of success remains strong as large banks continue to offload these non-core assets. In this industry, acquisition of either clients (other firms' businesses) or software/intellectual property is heavily assessed before the decision is made. Furthermore, you are not integrating manufacturing and other complex aspects of a business to create synergies in hopes of future sales, but instead building upon a similar platform to enhance the same services and capabilities already in place for existing and potential clients. Human capital management is key in this phase. The firm spent $57M in R&D in 2014 and plans to spend more this year as it further develops the property acquired. So the concern that the company overpaid or took on too much debt doesn't have much merit when examining the health of the balance sheet.For now, we will examine the financial performance and price appreciation since going public. Here we will see why and how the company experienced 350% returns since its March 31, 2010, IPO.Valuation And PerformanceThere is no doubt that SSNC has far outperformed financials and the overall market. In my opinion, earnings multiples are justified in the face of consistent growth since going public. With that said, I wouldn't consider the stock cheap either. It currently trades at a P/E of 41.81 with a forward P/E of 22 and a PEG of 2.22. With a 54% return over the last year, and a 15% return YTD, not even a secondary offering has been enough to curtail the stock's upward trajectory. Furthermore, we have seen an absolute dominance by SSNC since going public. Comparing the company to its two largest direct competitors, Northern Trust and State Street, it's clear that the best play to benefit from an immense amount of positive catalyst is SSNC.As we see above, SSNC has outperformed by over 280% and 300% its nearest competitor and the market respectively. This trend continues over a one-year chart where NTRS and STT as we see remained rather flat while SSNC gained 50% over that time period. We next will examine SSNC against its competitors on some basic performance metrics.This is the part of the chart where you hope to see the blue line at the bottom, unfortunately though that is not the case. There is a good reason for this, as we will see below when we examine performance metrics. One item that separates SSNC from its competitors is the massive IP portfolio that has been amassed as well as the future growth in EPS compared to the other two firms. Even though there are plenty of mid and large size providers, as well as a few banks still providing these services, ultimately the level of technological sophistication gives SSNC more a tech firm valuation than that of a financial services firm.We next examine some balance sheet items and notice a few interesting items. Debt to equity is actually a lot lower for SSNC than its competition, which in turn makes its ROE even more impressive compared to peers based on a larger denominator. Price to book comes in at a full point higher, which again adds to my perspective that the company certainly isn't ""cheap"" by any standard. The last chart below indicates clearly though why it commands such higher multiples than its two closest competitors.SSNC runs at a gross margin of 49%, having increased revenue over a five-year period by 170%, which is 7x that of Northern Trust. We see the spike came with a 325% increase in EPS, which in comparison to its peers, as well as its performance over the same time period, puts it right in line with expected values. Below, we see an annual chart of the income statement:(Source: Google Finance)We see that operating margins have remained relatively steady at 25% with a consistent growth rate in operating income while revenues have grown at very impressive rates, thanks to a series of acquisitions that have all added to the bottom line. What's more impressive is the consistency to which the company remains able to produce these consistent margins while having to integrate various acquired assets, including the September 2, 2015, acquisition of Varden Technologies into SSNC's dynamic platform and software or service offerings.Technical ViewFrom a technical perspective, the picture couldn't look much better. In a market where more than half the companies are in the red this year, the above long-term bullish channel represents significant strength in the face of an endless list of bearish catalysts that should have broken the trend. Not only did SSNC successfully complete a secondary offering, increasing the float over 10%, but also the market has witnessed one of the most volatile periods in its history. Beginning August 17th, the market spun into a violent string of ups and downs, sending us into the first real correction in four years. When we examine SSNC against the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) and NASDAQ (NASDAQ:QQQ), we see there's significant support and strength in the trading pattern. Investors can get an idea by just looking at the end of the chart. Below, we will see something very positive for investors, especially in these difficult conditions.As we see above, while the market's drawdown was over 10%, SSNC has come out the other side with half the volatility and losses. With a beta of 1.34 according to YCharts, the market is telling us that there is an appetite for SSNC, as we saw with the variety of well-known funds holding the name. As volatility continues, we may see a decline in total assets for the industry as a whole, but it will balance out with additional services provided. Since going public, the company has almost a spotless reporting record, with over 90% of the time beating consensus estimates. Granted there usually is only 7-10 estimates (doesn't have high coverage), it does have a $6.4B market cap, and an impressive list of investors. Below, we examine earnings results closer:Earnings and Price TargetNon-GAAP EPS Estimated vs. Actual(Source: Fidelity) All EPS estimates are based on ADJ Non-GAAP EPSAs we see above, the trend is also clear on the earnings scale. Since management can estimate on a relatively accurate basis revenue over a one-year period (there's a natural business cycle that revolves around regular reporting requirements such as month, quarter and year-end financial statements and NAV cutoff), the firm can expect to be within range barring any unusually large client leaving or jumping on board.Price Estimates - 18 month $117We see a consistent trend of beats as a result. With a constant rate of acquisitions, future revenue can be assumed to be accurate, with a very good possibility of guidance being raised. Thus, if we take the five-year PE ratio of 37.60 (a conservative estimate vs. current PE of over 41), we arrive at a 18-month price target of about 117 (37.6 x 3.12 Adj EPS). I know GAAP EPS is significantly lower than adjusted EPS, but including amortization of almost half the assets as an expense doesn't accurately reflect the true business value generated. Adjusted numbers exclude those expenses and thus in my opinion are more relevant than GAAP EPS in this specific situation. I believe institutional investors believe the same, as they have driven multiples to almost double over five years as we saw earlier.The reason I used 18 months is to be consistent with the full-year-end 2016 estimates while assuming the price would reflect the actual results after reporting sometime in February 2017 while not even considering any further multiple expansion that has been a trend these last three years. Based on a consistent level of growth, I think this price target is achievable, which represents a potential 80% return in just 18 months from now. Investors also should keep in mind CEO Bill Stone's remarks regarding use of cash. The company plans on using it quickly to pursue opportunities, which means we can expect at least another deal before year-end. This provides plenty of time for synergies and unexpected benefits to increase future performance.Trading Strategy - Long-Term BuyThe company plans on pursuing further acquisitions, so the potential for upside revision certainly exists (especially if synergies and human capital are optimized quickly). Without a liquid enough options market, I recommend hugging the 50-day moving average and look to buy on potential weakness when it is breached. Patience will make a difference. Investors should categorize this investment as a medium-risk play on the future growth of both complex regulation and compliance as well as assets in the financial services industry (specifically banking and asset managers of all types). Due to the acquisition-based strategy, I do not expect the dividend payout ratio to increase dramatically as returns continue to far exceed every benchmark. This trade is perfect for investors seeking growth and momentum behind a name while operating a large niche market with 50% gross margins. Despite paying a dividend, I do not see the dividend growing significantly enough to hope for high-yield income. Regardless, the fact there is a dividend may change that prediction a couple years down the line, in a different stage of its life cycle, and returning cash to shareholders due to a lack of acquisition targets.With that said, I believe the average year-end price target consensus estimate according to Nasdaq.com, the sentiment and average analyst recommendation remains a buy, with a recent upgrade by Jefferies to 75 (which is also the 52-week high and the most significant resistance point). I personally believe the upside is a bit limited in the short run and advise investors to buy with patience in the 60-62 range (at most 65), which should be achievable with the amount of volatility and direction of the markets today. At 60-65, you have a 15-25% upside until year end (based both on Jefferies PT and 52-week high), with a long-term business plan that can surpass any unexpected hiccup during the integration phases (Q4 results will feel the impact).Investors also should keep in mind that relative weakness on a significant level hasn't been felt in the name, so there remains a chance for a setback having a large part of the float in the hands of some beaten-down fund managers. Any miss will send them down significantly, which in the long run will just turn into an even better total return opportunity. Keep a long-term perspective for the benefits and synergies to fully make their way around the business cycle (minimum one year).Industry Opportunities And RisksAcquisition Focused Strategy - Risky but EffectiveIn an industry where the top three competitors each have about 13%, smaller niche firms are fighting for market share, hoping to become an attractive takeout target for the top five in the industry. As these businesses, especially the now largest SSNC, have grown, developed, and scaled their offerings, platform and resources, the barriers to entry are significant. With vast amounts of capital and time required to develop IP, disruption also is highly unlikely as administrative services are an essential element, especially with today's level of regulation and investor scrutiny/expectations.On the flip side, this puts pressure on SSNC, STT and NTRS to build their book by buying the assets banks are shedding. Due to the developed platforms, sales teams and human capital, buying new clients is a risky but efficient strategy. Being the industry leader, it's ironic the competition both hold and are listed as shareholders in SSNC for their wealth management services. This difference is what drives the risk down of losing clients you just bought off smaller firms. Talent as discussed earlier comes with the natural cycle of a career in the hedge fund space for middle and back office roles.Continuous Increase in Banking and Asset Management RegulationsWith numerous scandals, the 2008 crisis, evolving regulations both for banks and hedge funds, there is no shortage of compliance-related skills needed today. With that said, funds can't afford and don't attempt to build out large departments devoted to the issues. Instead internal departments work side by side with the administrator (as well as legal counsel and their auditors) to achieve this success. With growing synergies and needs being created and fulfilled, client retention becomes even more steady, barring liquidations and failures. Due to the Dodd-Frank Act, banks like Goldman Sachs and Citi Group (NYSE:C) have disposed of their services. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) spun off the unit, which now runs independently, and ranks as one of the top five in the industry. These dispositions bring not only resources, but also clients as well, usually for a very reasonable price (large banks aren't going to nickel and dime to achieve the disposition). Going forward, further consolidation plays a big role in future revenue opportunity.Risks Ahead for SSNCThere are no shortage of risks that come with this play. In 2008, we saw the Asset Management and Financial Services sector completely collapse. These types of events are sure to repeat over and over in the future. Since SSNC went public in 2010 after the market had rebounded, we don't have any precedent as to the results in the face of utter chaos. Relatively speaking, any company is going to tank in that kind of environment, but asset managers and the nature of their business is much more sensitive to prolonged periods of market declines. Since the core administrative services are necessary unless the doors close (which many did in 2008), we know being an industry leader means it is well grounded enough to endure the pain. We undoubtedly will see a mini crisis in the next five years (my guess related to high-yield credit in the energy space and global bond liquidity) that may impact it in a negative way.As a true multinational company, foreign currency risk exists, including last quarter's 2.8% hit to the top line, which may seem small but in actuality is quite high. There isn't much that can be done, and with the added shares to the float, and future hurdles for the market, we may see a rare miss in the short run.Other inherent risks that come with the nature of the business like disruption and competition, as well as integration risk (due to large acquisition strategy) are just part of the equation. Thus far, across a five-year chart, we see a relatively uninterrupted upward trajectory with reasonable momentum and defensive price movement during rougher waters, such as 2011. Overall I would rate SSNC a Moderate to Moderately Higher risk for conservative investors. Even though we haven't seen dramatic losses yet, it doesn't mean the future can't turn. SSNC's extended period of EPS beats in itself is a risk as we know statistically a miss becomes more probable with each one. In my opinion, the market, the nature of the business and market position of SSNC are enough to justify assuming the risk. Its growth strategy focused on acquisitions will most likely return abundant value over multiple years.ConclusionSSNC isn't a name many investors would recognize. It certainly isn't going to become a glamorous momentum play, but it's a rock-solid company in a lucrative niche market. Pursuing SSNC is essentially pursuing an M&A focused business that's solely dependent on the broad spectrum of the financial service industry while commanding valuations more in line with a software or technology related company. This benefit comes from the constant level of demand based on the fact the services are necessary and integral to its core client base of hedge funds, private equity, and other types of large institutional asset managers. Funds have a combined $44 trillion under management, and will exceed over a billion in yearly revenue at 50% gross margin shortly. Intelligent and strategic investments with opportunistic timing for raising capital has put the company in the position to take the next step up, which ultimately will drive the price up to my multi-year target.Having seen firsthand the difference in services and the evolution of the industry, I know the real value quality solutions bring to the client both in cost savings and performance. Large funds many times spend millions developing their own software. Citadel even had administrative services under its umbrella years ago. Even though I genuinely find the valuations are at fair value, I also see immense opportunity, thus justifying them for SSNC. Since I take a long-term perspective, I know a year from now the company will have fully integrated not only Advent, but also future acquisitions, both small and large, that will continue to drive revenue growth. Seeing the immense amount of fund managers that have invested in SSNC past and present assures me the industry maintains a pristine opinion of the firm's quality. Examining the performance over half a decade adds to that assertion as well. After all, I have full faith as a group asset managers all over the world will continue to both grow and continuously look to develop and invest in their own success. These strengths and industry trends make patiently building a position in SSNC a compelling consideration."
3921536,54942,2016-02-24T15:09:27-05:00,The shares have lost a quarter of their value in the last three months due to the market volatility and declines.We think investors are assuming too much correlation to the moves of the S&P 500 and think comparisons to 2009 are apt.The company continues their buying spree adding Citi Fund Services which creates the second largest fund administration business in the world.,"We highlighted SS&C Technologies (NASDAQ:SSNC) as an emerging financial technology leader after they acquired Advent Software back in early 2015. Since our initial call, the shares are down 4% but have fallen by over 23% over the last three months due to the market volatility which has lead to lots of discussion about the sustainability of their organic growth. We think the share price decline assumes a significant amount of concern over growth as a whole but we believe these risks to be overblown. But the recent fourth quarter release should have mitigated some of these concerns as the solid report was completely disregarded by investors. Despite the market challenges, management issued a positive outlook and we feel that additional mergers and acquisitions are likely to continue including larger deals like the Advent transaction.We think SS&C is emerging as a financial software powerhouse with significant exposure in the alternative asset fund administration market, institutional and investment management market, and the financial advisory market. They are the only company that provides software and services solutions across all three of these markets, while offering a flexible and on-demand delivery model, a key competitive advantage.Fourth Quarter Was Solid... So What's Wrong?The company reported a strong fourth quarter with $319 million in revenue when excluding the approximate $7 million contribution from Primatics. This was near the high-end of their guidance range of $312 million to $320 million. Management issued guidance which implies a 5% organic growth rate in constant currency at the midpoint. The market took this as a bearish item given their long-term growth target of 5% to 10%. We think this is a positive given the amount of fund closures and the volatility in the market over the last couple of months providing a backdrop for advisors to put off purchases.Organic growth was weak but not nearly as bad as investors were thinking. The company posted a 0.5% organic revenue increase after backing out the $127 million in acquisition revenue. The slowdown in organic growth was mainly due to a major customer loss. In addition, some of the cross-selling revenue is being unjustly placed into the acquisition revenue bucket instead of organic. For example, the company had a PORTIA client that moved into other SS&C products including Advent. Thus, organic revenue fell $250K due to the loss from PORTIA but they gained $1.25 million in revenue as they added Advent. That $1.25 million gets thrown into the acquisition revenue bucket since Advent hadn't lapped the one-year anniversary. So we need to be careful looking at just one metric, organic growth, for operating performance.We think investors are applying the weak start to the year for the stock market as cause for selling the shares. But we would counter that the firm's assets under administration are only approximately 14% directionally exposed to equity markets. The assets have a 35% allocation to the equity asset class but the net exposure of these assets are just 40%. Thus, we think the reaction because of the weaker equity markets is overblown, especially when you factor in the strong start of the year for bonds which is a large allocation of AUA.M&A Activity Likely To Ramp And Get BiggerSS&C has a long history of acquisitions completing some 42 since going public. The business model is such that the integration and proven sales growth had led to significant margin expansion. Just in the last twelve months, they have announced five additional acquisitions and closed on three of them. They closed on the transforming Advent deal this past July which added more than $400 million in revenue. Since then, they have closed on two small tuck-in deals including Primatics Financial which moves them into the attractive end-to-end loan risk and financial solutions market.But the pending Citi Fund Services acquisition is another of their larger-end deals costing the firm approximately $325-$350 million. We think the acquisition is likely to give them much greater scale in the fund administration business along with giving them greater exposure to Asia. We think they got the assets at a cheap price given that Citi needed to get rid of the assets. The Volcker Rule limited the amount of money the large bank could have invested in hedge funds and private equity. They placed these assets into Citi Holdings as they have attempted to sell them since 2009.We think this is another accretive acquisition as management can bring the units' margins to the corporate average. The fund administration business is characterized by strong customer service and low pricing strategy. Scale is essential given the low average margins overall and the need to spread fixed costs over a larger revenue base. Management noted that customer reception has been positive so far as Citi clients are likely to be happy joining an organization that makes fund administration their core focus.During their recent analyst day, management noted that they will continue to evaluate deals stating they look at 20-30 potential transactions per quarter. But at the current 4.6x in pro forma leverage, at $2.4 billion in debt, up sharply from the first quarter of last year when it was 1.5x, could preclude future larger acquisitions. But we think they can lever up to 6.0x or more given their historical deleveraging.Free cash flow is set to inflect to over $400 million this year, up from $280 million in fiscal 2015, which should allow them to delever very quickly. They pay out approximately $50 million per year in dividends and capex is minimal leaving a significant amount that can be applied to debt pay down. Cash flow from operations runs at 112% of net income because of the low working capital and 28% cash tax. We think they delever by 0.8x to 1.0x turn per year. But the company doesn't need to pay down a ton of debt in order to remove a significant amount of risk from their balance sheet given the stickiness of their revenue stream and the profitability of the business.(Source: Investor Presentation)Near and Long Term OpportunitiesThe near term opportunity remains with their above expectation synergy accretion, mostly from the Advent deal but also the HPA business. Synergies at both acquisitions are progressing ahead of plan according to management, something we stated was likely in our prior write-up. Advent had cost synergies of $7.8 million in the quarter, with an annual run rate at $34 million. HPA synergies are running at $14.2 million on an annual basis. For all of 2016, management is assuming $35 to $40 million of synergies from the Advent acquisition alone.Longer-term, we think they continue to acquire and roll-up more fund administration businesses and threaten State Street for market leadership. Many banks similar to Citi are getting out of the business and we believe SS&C management is looking at several additional acquisitions in the space. We think they can acquire solid assets at value prices given the market dynamic while adding significant accretion due to their scale.ValuationThe sell-off in the shares has produced a solid buying opportunity as investors over-emphasize the impact of the equity market on the business. As we noted above, the sensitivity to the equity markets is minimal at just 14% of total assets under administration. We calculate a 5% move in the S&P 500 would result in only $3 million of revenue impact per quarter, or less than a 1% impact to total quarterly revenue generation.We also believe that the market is embedding some bear-market application to the shares in case another recession and large drop occurs. We would note that SS&C saw organic revenue fall by just 9% in 2009 despite the massive fall in the market and the amount of outflows from hedge funds. Total revenue fell by just 3% in 2009 while adjusted EBITDA fell by just 2%. We think the beta with the equity market is actually fairly low (less than 0.25) but that investors continue to sell the shares sharply on market moves lower.We valued the business both on a free cash flow basis and EV/EBITDA. We expect free cash flow of nearly $500 million in fiscal 2017. At 6.5% free cash flow yield, the shares are worth approximately $74 at 103 million diluted shares. That yield is much higher than the long-term average closer to 3.8% but accounts for the balance sheet risks and market volatility.On an EV/EBITDA basis, we modeled to $700 million by fiscal 2017, up from $620 million this year (our base case previously was $625 million). At 14x EBITDA, on par with our expected long-term earnings growth rate, the shares are worth $62.50 today and $76.70 by year-end. The 14x multiple is on the low-end of their historical range which has been as high as 24x.ConclusionWe continue to think the market is applying too much equity exposure to the business model even though the correlation to the S&P is fairly low. This is creating a buying opportunity as the expected weak organic growth guidance didn't materialize with management issuing a 5% increase. We think the balance sheet is also a large driver of the value of the shares given the high leverage which is being punished in the current environment. But management has a history of delevering quickly and we think this overhang will be gone by year-end, if not sooner."
2313325,40031,2014-07-15T09:07:03-04:00,"SS&C Technologies has enjoyed a steady pace of growth since inception which has been fueled by major acquisitions.
        Organic revenue growth is expected between 5% and 10% in the future and should be pushed higher by more accretive acquisitions.
        The company has digested its 2012 acquisitions and paid down debt, making room for another strategic acquisition.
        Current valuation leaves room for modest upside, but certain developments might create room for a rise in future expectations leading to meaningful upside going forward.","SS&C Technologies (NASDAQ:SSNC) has been a strong performer in the last couple of years, as it has risen almost 200% from its 2010 IPO. The company is among the leaders in its space, and has benefited from the rising prominence of cloud computing, rising regulatory burdens and wealth globalization, which have enabled the company to grow its earnings and revenue at a high rate. I wrote about SS&C in July 2013, and suggested that the stock should be bought on a pullback to $33 or $34. Investors had an opportunity to buy at these levels (but not cheaper) in August 2013, and the stock is up 30% since then. Given the current expectations, further short-term upside seems limited, but there are catalysts that could push the stock higher, as I will discuss in this article. The company is expected to grow revenue organically between 5% and 10% in the future, and this figure should be pushed higher by acquisitions, as the company has a successful history of acquiring companies and integrating them in a way that was beneficial to its shareholders and customers.Slowing growth is not a concernSS&C's revenue and earnings growth accelerated significantly in 2012 and 2013. This was a consequence of two strategic acquisitions in 2012 which boosted the growth significantly at the time. The Globe Op acquisition in June 2012 was the biggest acquisition in the company's history and has positioned SS&C as the world's largest independent fund administrator. Once these acquisitions were integrated, the revenue growth came down to 6% to 8% and is in line with long-term expectations. And this is not a cause to be concerned, since the company's forward valuation is in line with these growth expectations. The organic growth is expected to come from new products and services, extension into other verticals and through increased average selling prices. The company has launched an REIT servicing group in April, which presents a $100 million revenue opportunity. Another important opportunity for the company is in regulatory services, which is a $500 million market opportunity. The adoption of SS&C's regulatory solutions is being driven by several challenges that its clients face: growing competition for investors, tighter operating budgets and the need for specialized talent and technology to handle new regulatory reporting requirements. The company announced an important milestone in April 2014, when its Globe Op regulatory solutions business reached 150 clients and over 2,000 funds.Other factors that are expected to contribute to solid organic growth in the future are the globalization of wealth and wealth management, operational cost controls and mobility. SS&C's investment intelligence service is also an important growth driver for the future. This service enables large-scale investment managers the ability to view their risks and their returns and all of the capabilities from one platform. It is also a way to deliver services on a mobile platform to all customers, which is becoming increasingly important, and has become a way for the company to leverage its existing technology services.In addition to these growth drivers, the company is expanding its sales force rapidly, which should contribute to strong organic growth going forward. Management believes that there are opportunities that are untapped and which the current sales force is unable to take advantage of. The number of sales reps has already been increased to 110 and there should be around 150 sales reps at the end of the year. This should help the company to increase its organic growth rate above current levels.More acquisitions to fuel revenue growth above 10%SS&C has spent the last two years on integrating the acquisitions that it made in 2012. The acquisitions have burdened the company's balance sheet, and caused its leverage ratio to go up to 4.2x its EBITDA at the time. SS&C has used its strong cash flow to pay back debt, and its leverage ratio has been almost halved since Q2 2012, and currently stands at 2.2x its EBITDA. The deleveraging leaves room for the company to do more acquisitions in the future. And this is what the management intends to do if and when it finds an interesting opportunity. The company has been very successful in the past and has managed to pay a reasonable price for the targeted companies. The company has been doing tuck in deals at 4x to 6x EBITDA, while it has paid between 10x and 15x EBITDA on bigger strategic acquisitions. Management has stressed that it will not overpay regardless of the situation in the market, and given the current situation, it will certainly be harder to find a suitable candidate in that price range. But it is not impossible and the situation might change for the better valuation-wise going forward. I believe that another strategic acquisition is in the making, which should boost the company's growth profile going forward, which should result in more upside for SS&C shareholders. The Globe Op acquisition in 2012 is a fine example of a possible impact on the share price, as SS&C's stock price has doubled since the acquisition, and its revenue has grown from $370 million in 2011 to $712 million in 2013.Given the current debt levels and cash balance, the company would have between $800 million and $900 million in available funds to do a strategic acquisition (assuming a maximum leverage ratio of 4x EBITDA). If we assume that the company pays up the maximum price at 15x EBITDA, this would bring the company's 2014 EBITDA above $370 million. If we also assume that the acquired company has the same or slightly lower EBITDA margin, the revenue should be boosted by at least $130 million. After the deal, there is potential for additional operational and cost synergies that would translate into higher revenues and earnings a few quarters after the acquired company gets integrated. These assumptions will be the base of my bullish scenario that I will lay out later in the article. But of course, the company could acquire its target under better conditions, which would lead to even higher upside potential in the next couple of years.Valuation and price targetA look at SS&C's forward P/E ratio chart reveals that the stock is trading near the middle of its valuation range in the last four years. This leaves room for 25% upside from the current price if the stock goes back to the upper range of its valuation.Source: YCharts.comThis is based on the current analyst consensus. However, the company has been able to beat consensus estimates in the past and there is no reason to believe that it should not continue to do so in the future. Consensus estimates have moved up steadily in the last 90 days, and 2014 EPS expectations currently stand at $2.31. As a reminder, they were at $2.10 a year ago, at the time I wrote my first article on SS&C, and 2013 estimates were $1.87, while the company delivered $1.97. In the table below, you can compare analyst estimates and my own expectations for EPS and revenue for 2014 and 2015. This is my base case scenario which does not include potential strategic acquisitions that have the potential to boost the growth rates significantly going forward.Source: Yahoo! Finance, Author's estimatesAlthough I stated that there is 25% upside from the current price, this represents the high end of the valuation range. My base case scenario implies a forward P/E of 20, which translates into a $48 price target. This represents 11% upside from the current price.Bullish scenarioAs I mentioned earlier, the probability for the company to do a strategic acquisition in the next two years is significant. As time passes, the company's balance sheet will get stronger, the debt load will go down and the probability for an acquisition increases. Of course, the company could do a few small deals instead of a large one, but all of them are expected to be accretive to earnings and boost revenues.Source: SS&C analyst day presentationThe initial impact of an acquisition in the past has been negative on the company's margins, as the acquired businesses often had lower margins. Once they were acquired, operational and cost synergies kicked in and margins went back up to previous levels and even higher. Management has a long-term goal for the EBITDA margin around 45%, so there is room for further margin expansion in the future. As I stated earlier, I expect that the potential large acquisition should boost revenues by at least $130 million, bringing the growth rate to a 15% to 20% range in the next two years (or around 20% to 25% if the deal is done at the start of the year). Earnings should grow at a higher rate than revenues even if the company buys a company with lower margins, since the net margin will rise due to a significantly lower tax rate as compared to 2013 and 2012 (the company managed to lower its tax rate from 35% in 2012 to 30% in 2013 and 28% is the expected tax rate for 2014). Earnings should expand more rapidly in the second year of the acquisition as margins go back up to historical levels and continue to expand.Source: Author's estimatesThe revenue and earnings expansion should lead to P/E expansion, and bring SS&C forward P/E to a 25 to 30 range, which translates into a $61 price target based on a one-year time horizon at the low end of the P/E expansion range and $74 at the top end of the range. This translates into 40% to 70% upside based on the current price. The longer term upside potential exceeds 100% in this case, especially if we look at the TTM P/E ratio range in 2012-2013 period, when the company had its large jump in earnings and revenue due to the Globe Op acquisition.Source: YCharts.comDownside risksOne major risk for SS&C is the fierce competition. The competition does have a sort of an edge when approaching clients. SS&C's CEO William Stone said on the analyst day that a potential large client said that they have the best technology, the best people and the best processes. But the client still went with the big bank competitor. The only reason for this is that if the client had a problem with the platform, the bank's balance sheet would ""step in."" Being independent might be an advantage over the competition in more than one way, but this is a major issue for the company as it tries to get large clients. State Street (NYSE:STT) and the Bank of New York (NYSE:BNY) are very strong competitors, and their giant balance sheets are a part of their sales pitch when SS&C as a competitor is concerned.The other major risk is the state of the economy and financial markets. Adverse changes in the economy and the financial services industry would have a profound effect on demand for the company's products and services. A drop in clients' assets would decrease revenues and profits.On the valuation side, there is room for 20% to 25% downside from the current price, based on a forward P/E range in the past four years. This would bring the forward P/E to 15, which would be a solid entry for long-term oriented investors.ConclusionSS&C continues to execute its growth strategy very well. The company has successfully integrated many of the acquired companies and stands to benefit from further technological advances and from increased demands for its products and services. In the base case scenario, the upside is 11%, while the bullish scenario could push the stock up between 40% and 70% in the next six to twelve months. The downside should be limited to 20% to 25%, giving investors a solid reward/risk ratio based on the bull case. If you do not believe in the higher growth and valuation through acquisitions case, a pullback of 10% to 15% would bring the odds back in the favor of the longs even for the base case scenario.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SSNC over the next 72 hours.

2897296,54942,2015-02-10T05:00:00-05:00,"SS&C's acquisition is a bit out of the box compared to most of their 49 past acquisitions given Advent already carried EBITDA margins above 30%.Folding in Advent will add in the fast growing RIA channel to their mix, a segment that they have little current exposure.We think the synergy estimates by the firm are likely very low and that the company can achieve large accretion in '15 and '16.","SS&C Technologies (NASDAQ:SSNC) is well known in the financial industry for its top quality financial management software systems. They have a suite of products including portfolio accounting and reporting, trading and trade order management, performance measurement, global markets, and risk management software. In addition, they've built arrays of solutions tailored for specific industries including alternative investments, asset management, commercial lending, and municipal finance organizations.Many of their products are used at smaller hedge funds, asset managers and registered investment advisors to outsource a significant amount of reporting, accounting and compliance work. We like this area of the software, software-as-a-service, and cloud-based subscription service, as it tends to be very sticky, recurring revenue. In fact, the largest reason these companies lose a customer is the hedge fund or asset manager closing down shop.SS&C has been adept at acquiring tangential companies that add to their capabilities and complement existing offerings. The management team is one of the best in the business and excels at integrating these acquisitions into the company and reaping a large amount of synergies. This is why we took notice when the company acquired DST Global Solutions in early December. But what really piqued our interest was the subsequent merger with Advent Software (NASDAQ:ADVS) only two months later creating a financial software powerhouse.DST Global Acquisition Moves Them Into Fund AccountingSS&C bought DST Global Solutions, a subsidiary of DST Systems, for $95 million in cash. The products that they received in the acquisition include the industry-leading fund accounting platform, HiPortfolio, and investment data management and analytics platform, Anova. The company used about $20 million of cash they had on hand along with $75 million by drawing down on its line of credit.We think the acquisition was a good one as it added more than 155 customers worldwide along with adding additional capabilities and service offerings. DST Global is a 390 person business with $60 to $65 million in annual revenues, most of which is derived from Asia and the EMEA region. In addition to adding to the scope of the business, they will be able to cross-sell other products while creating an end-to-end solution for a wide range of customers worldwide.They will now compete directly with competitors like State Street (NYSE:STT), BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), CITCO, Envestnet (NYSE:ENV), SEI and Financial Engines (NASDAQ:FNGN). By moving into this area of the financial world, they should be better able to win additional business on their other software platforms, as they will now have a full front to back office solution capability.Advent Acquisition Is the Game Changer Investors Were Looking ForOn February 2, 2015, SS&C acquired Advent Software, which should increase its revenue generation immediately by over 50%. The company paid $2.7 billion in cash equating to $44.25 per share of Advent stock plus the assumption of debt. The acquisition price was a 43% premium to the prior day's share price. The company is funding the purchase with $3 billion of debt financing and $400 million of equity, resulting in pro forma leverage of 5.3x net debt/EBITDA upon closing of the deal. Management indicated that initial expectations call for them to pay down approximately 0.8x per year of that leverage.The combined entity will now have over 10,000 customers worldwide and revenue of approximately $1.2 billion creating a financial software powerhouse. Advent has many of the same end-user customer exposures with hedge funds, fund administrators, prime brokers, family offices, and wealth management firms (RIAs).The combination of the two entities builds on the SS&C's objective of creating the greatest depth of expertise, software technology and service. One of the areas of the financial world that SS&C lacked a presence was in the RIA (registered investment advisor) space. This is a very fast growing piece of the financial industry as broker/dealers continue to decline in relevancy and the advisor world moves more towards independent financial consultants.(Source: SS&C Technologies Investor Presentation)We think the resulting business will have a highly visible and more diversified revenue base with recurring revenue north of 90% and extreme customer stickiness above 95%. Advent has over $30 trillion in assets administered by software it licenses to 7,000 firms. The gem in the business is their Black Diamond software, which Advent purchased a few years ago. This business is an independent group of Advent that now has 540 clients with more than $245 billion in assets on its portfolio management, reporting, and rebalancing platform. The platform has seen significant growth with the client base climbing by more than 125% and assets on the platform rising by more than 240% since Advent acquired them in June of 2011.Our experience within the industry leads us to note that the Black Diamond piece was a great find. The growth is likely to continue for some time, as there are significant share gain for the taking from lower quality competition. Moving into the SSNC umbrella, we think that triple-digit growth rate can actually accelerate and be a large profit driver for the firm.(Source: SS&C Technologies Investor Presentation)Synergies Are Likely to Be AbundantSSNC has a proven model of integrating companies and generating growth through consolidated platforms. Over the last fifteen years, they have acquired some 40 companies with a successful history of de-leveraging through growth and strong cash flow. The initial company estimate pegs the transaction as immediately accretive to adjusted EPS and will enable SS&C to deliver $3.05 to $3.15 in adjusted 2016 EPS.We believe the acquisition is a good strategic fit for SSNC with a combined or tiered product offering in the financial accounting space likely in the next year. As we noted above, it's the complementary areas - like Advent's exposure to the RIA space along with SSNC trading execution platforms - that demonstrate the strong fit between the two companies.(Source: SS&C Technologies Investor Presentation)The one area that makes this acquisition a bit different is that SSNC typically buys up underperforming assets, typically generating EBITDA margins at 15% or less, and then uses its scale and global presence to synergize the new acquisition and boost the margins significantly. Here however, Advent is already a superior company generating EBITDA margins around between 25% and 30% (unadjusted) and around 35% adjusted.SSNC paid highly too at 17.5x this year's expected EBITDA at Advent. However, given the synergy potential, we think they actually got a great deal, which we will detail. Firstly, management stated that they expect the annual run rate, pre-tax cost synergies to be over $45 million. Revenue synergies are expected to increase organic growth by 1% in the second half of this year and accelerated by 50 bps in each subsequent year through 2017. These are likely low-end estimates and ignore other potential synergies likely to significantly boost margins and profit.Our Assessment Of the Synergy Opportunity Leads Us to Believe Shares are UndervaluedWe feel that they are understating the potential synergies and accretion to the company. We ran through our own analysis of Advent to see what kind of potential synergies would be available under a more likely scenario. First, we looked back at some of the past acquisitions that they have made. We wanted to find acquisitions where SS&C was buying an already successful company rather than a struggling firm that they turn around.Most recently, the GlobeOp purchase in 2012 is very similar to the Advent acquisition in that GlobeOp already carried EBITDA margins around 30%. In just 18 months, they were able to use their integration team and cross-selling opportunities to expand revenue by over 25% while expanding the EBITDA margins 650 bps.Just the month before, the company bought Thomson Reuters' PORTIA application, which allows investment managers to track and manage the day-to-day activity in their portfolios. At the time, the business had strong EBITDA margins in the low 40% area, which the company was able to grow to 57% by the end of 2013 while growing revenue significantly. SSNC was able to integrate the PORTIA platform with their own solutions for reconciliation, performance measurement, and attribution analysis creating a best-in-breed product and increasing their footprint in some of the world's most sophisticated investment management firms.Back in 2005, they acquired Canadian-based Financial Models Company paying a premium valuation of $159 million. The move was their first foray into portfolio management solutions. The firm was able to, over the next eight years, grow revenue by nearly 40% while expanding EBITDA margins from the low 30% area to approximately 52% in 2013.In each case, they were able to take on the additional leverage and work diligently to pare the leverage back down to normalized 1.5x levels. In 2005, the company was taken private by the Carlyle Group at a leverage of 6.8x. Five years later, Carlyle IPO'd the company at which time the company was down to 3.0x leverage, 3.8x turns lower in five years or 0.8x per year. By the time they did their follow-on offering roughly a year later, leverage was cut in half to 1.5x.The next large increase in the leverage of the firm came when they acquired GlobeOp in mid-2012, which we mentioned above. This was a much larger acquisition than they were accustomed to doing with a purchase price of $834 million, occurring not long after the Portia deal for $170 million. With the approximately $1 billion in new purchases, the company had boosted their leverage back up to 4.2x. Within three years, the firm was able to reduce that leverage again to 1.4x, reducing it by approximately 1.0x per year. The Advent purchase will boost leverage back up to 5.3x, which we noted above the company has guided to reducing by 0.8x per year with over $1.2 billion of develeraging expected by 2018.We think the company can trim combined research and development by approximately one quarter by the end 2016 through elimination of dual facilities and software overlap. This would save approximately $37 million in fiscal 2016, almost the $45 million guided by management alone. This is evident given Advent's support engineers, which can be folded into SSNC with new product development being largely eliminated.The largest piece of synergy savings are likely to come from their sales and marketing consolidation. We think there is a chance of a 20% reduction of the combined sales and marketing expenses by the end of next year. This is just the overlap between the sales teams devoted to accounting portfolio software sales at Advent that are no longer needed. By combining the sales teams and eliminating other expenses where sales professionals can be combined covering other product areas, they could save as much as 35%. At 35%, the combined firm would realize annual savings of $45 million.Within cost of goods sold, it's difficult to peg any direct synergy potential. We have to go on historical precedence here where SSNC has been able to consolidate and contain their costs. We can leave the assumption of any synergies within that line item as flat, but would hedge that more likely than not, they will be able to squeeze out some sort of savings.The other big potential savings will come on the tax side. The company will likely take on approximately $2.5 billion of additional interest paying long-term debt in order to finance the deal, net of any debt extinguishment during the rest of the year. We estimate the interest rate on their debt to be around 5% given their BB (negative watch) credit rating. We think the debt they will issue will carry coupons around 5.8% given the large issuance and the likely credit downgrade from the ratings agencies. If downgraded, which we give a 50/50 likelihood of occurring, the rate will be closer to 6% given the current yield-to-worst of B-rated high yield corporate bonds, which are at 6.1%.Advent carries a slightly higher tax rate at 34% last year, up from 26% in fiscal 2013, as they have finally used up their tax credits and NOLs. We think accretion could be significant given the expected debt issuance and interest rate. The tax shield on such an issuance could equate to between $11.6 million and $21.2 million or $0.12 and $0.22 per share. We base these figures on $2.4 billion of new debt with an interest rate of 5.5% to 6%.ValuationIn all, the combined synergies we expect should help add approximately 450 bps to SS&C's EBITDA margins next year and additional gains thereafter. Our base case suggests that EBITDA margins will expand out to 45.5% in fiscal 2016 for the consolidated entity, up from approximately 39.8% upon closing. We think the combined entity will be able to accelerate already fast growing earnings and revenue generation through the combination of cross-selling opportunities and synergy effects. Below is our best guess for valuation:(Source: Author's Calculation)Those margins are likely to continue expanding out further over the subsequent few years. Similar to the integrations we detailed above, we think the company can eventually add over 10% EBITDA margins, as a base case, and possibly by as early as 2018. Under that type of scenario, we think the shares would be worth around $105 per share, a significant 72% premium to the current trading price over the next two years.Before the acquisition, SSNC was trading at 16.5x EV/EBITDA so using a similar multiple equates to a $78 intrinsic value using the valuation matrix we input above. However, we think the multiple should expand out given the clout, scale, and expanded margins that are expected. Our base case uses a 17x multiple, which we feel is still fairly conservative given our projections of at least 20% growth over the next five years.We think there is an asymmetric upside opportunity given the easy-pickings of synergies and strong recurring revenue streams. The cross-selling opportunities are a call-option on the shares - something we think is highly likely to boost the organic revenue growth, which was already guided by management.RisksWe think the largest risk is macro-driven as the chance of the Advent deal falling through is extremely low. The risk of significant consolidation within some of the end industries would be the most detrimental to the company's growth. Given that we are in the latter innings of the market cycle, we think increased consolidation among investment banks, investment managers and other financial firms are likely. When these types of large consolidations occur, the number of licenses between the combined firms typically declines reducing revenue to SSNC. The largest customer for the company represents less than 3% of total revenue.The other issue could come from a bear market where assets at the underlying firms decline decreasing trading volumes, firm revenue, and discretionary budgets leaving less capital for new software. A large portion of new sales comes from cross selling additional software or services to existing customers. The bull market of the last five years has boosted revenue at these asset managers increasing discretionary spend on these outsource solutions. A downturn would reverse that trend curbing the current growth rates of both firms.ConclusionWe think the Advent acquisition will be a game changer for SS&C, as it will create a complete end-to-end financial software solutions company for virtually the entire financial sector. We believe the company can gear up its EBITDA margins and revenue growth through significant synergies and cross selling. The shares haven't responded as positively to the news, as we would have thought given where we think their pro forma will end up. Our assessment is that investors are weary of the significant debt load but as we noted above, management has considerable experience delevering large debt levels through strong cash flow generation and debt paydown. We also detailed the history of management at extracting significantly higher EBITDA margins even when buying firms that carry strong margins already."
3976580,56112,2016-05-21T07:00:00-04:00,"SS&C has a lot of qualities I don't usually like - high leverage and a focus on inorganic growth.... but every rule has an exception, and I actually like this story quite a lot.With a strong focus on technology/automation that allows it to extract substantially better margins than competitors, SS&C can be thought of as the Interactive Brokers of fund administration services/software.The stock isn't obviously cheap in context of leverage, but double-digit earnings growth can easily be sustained over the next few years, and the value creation runway is long.","If you've read one of my articles before, you're probably aware that I'm about as valuation-stingy and leverage-averse as they come - so it's a testament to the strength of the SS&C Technologies (NASDAQ:SSNC) story that I'm actually cautiously bullish amidst the current dip despite >4.5x trailing leverage and an enterprise valuation multiple that's still fairly robust even after a 20%+ pullback since October.Although those quantitative issues are enough to leave me on the sidelines, I do believe many investors may be underestimating some of the strengths that have allowed SS&C to rapidly grow into the second-largest fund administration provider, and simultaneously overplaying some of the risk factors. Admittedly, this isn't a cheap stock, particularly if you're a purist like I am who casts a skeptical eye on add-backs like stock-based compensation. Nonetheless, I think the long-term growth story here is pretty strong, and investors who are less valuation-sensitive than I might find the current market malaise to be an opportunity to get in on a ""compounder"" investment for the long term.Pricing Power: Watch, But Don't PanicSometimes you can be a victim of your own success - investors like strong margins, but start to get scared when they're too good. With SS&C, this fear is out in full force - it's almost absurd to be posting 40%+ EBITDA margins as a provider of fund administration services for hedge funds, RIAs, and institutional asset managers. Indeed, there's a reason that ""back-office"" functions are increasingly outsourced by most firms and belittled by their employees - they're viewed as annoying, but not particularly glorious and certainly not very profitable.With a spate of poor returns over the past few years, there's been increasing media scrutiny around whether hedge funds really justify their high fees - and as a result, many major allocators such as CalPERS, MetLife, AIG, and the NYC Public Employee Pension Fund have publicly announced their decision to pull hedge fund investments; indeed, Q1 2016 marked the first time since the financial crisis that hedge funds saw two consecutive quarters of outflow. These are enough to drive bearishness on SSNC, and indeed, while the short interest isn't huge, it's certainly risen pretty dramatically over the past year:I'll talk about the direct impact on the total addressable market/assets under administration a bit later, but I think the bigger issue here is really margins. I think we can add ""lower investment management fees"" as a third item to the certainty of death and taxes - and with alternative asset managers (comprising about half of SS&C's business) likely to see lower profitability going forward between fee compression on the top line and increased regulatory costs on the bottom line, it stands to reason that investors are worried about SS&C facing margin compression over time.I don't deny that it will be challenging for SS&C to maintain - much less improve - its margins. But I think there's an important point of differentiation here - even if pricing compresses to the degree that competitors are squeezed very significantly, it would be more of an annoyance than a death knoll for SS&C.SS&C simply has better technology and a more efficient operating model than most of the industry; there's strong reason to believe it has leveraged a focus on automation of manual processes into a defensible position as lowest-cost provider in fund administration, not dissimilar to what Thomas Peterffy has done with Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) in the brokerage space. This is evidenced by the company's demonstrated ability to substantially improve the profitability of acquired businesses; I thought slide 27 from last year's Analyst Day presentation was a particularly useful visual:The acquisition of Citi Fund Services further substantiates this point; despite having plenty of scale (6.5% of the hedge fund administration market), Citi was generating margins less than half of SS&C's.The takeaway here is this: while the industry as a whole may well face margin compression, a scenario where SS&C's margins were reduced by 5-10 percentage points would be catastrophic to the profitability of many other providers, and likely lead to a lot of retrenchment/exiting the business (as is already ongoing with many of the big banks' divisions.) I don't think investors should be expecting a lot of long-term margin leverage out of SS&C, but I also don't think investors should be overly worried about severe margin compression.Organic Growth: Yes, Management Is Too Optimistic; No, It's Not That ImportantIf there's anything that gets my goat as much as high leverage, it's companies that have limited organic growth prospects and rely on inorganic growth to drive value. To every rule there is an exception, though, and SS&C is one of the few.I view SS&C's target of 5-10% organic revenue growth as pretty optimistic, particularly at the high end. They will get some natural growth out of investment returns at the funds they administer, and will likely pick up some market share over time, plus benefit from increasing penetration in private equity and other areas where the back office is less outsourced than hedge funds - but given that they're already getting to be a size leader, at some point they're going to run into the fact that hedge funds seem more likely to see net outflows over the next decade than net inflows.While that leaves me believing that SS&C's organic growth will not be high-single-digits over time, I also don't think that's a particular concern over the medium term. The company's technology platform and scale make it a natural acquirer for those looking to get out of the industry - and there are plenty. The travails of big banks are well documented, and with new capital requirements and regulatory restrictions leading many to deemphasize and downsize prime brokerage, the synergies with fund administration aren't what they once were. Due to its ability to extract substantial synergies, SS&C is a preferred buyer, as it can pay a robust EBITDA multiple and still generate solid returns internally - for example, if it brings Citi up to corporate-level margins, it will have paid a sub-5x EBITDA multiple.Tail Risk Probably Not As Big As ImaginedThe final issue here is the company's exposure to market risk; with many investors concerned about the length of the bull market, SS&C is facing questions about its risk in a significant contraction. The high leverage, at first glance, appears to amplify these concerns.The qualitative argument - that SS&C's high alternatives exposure means that its assets-under-administration level has limited direct equity market correlation - is backed up by quantitative results from the financial crisis (during which SS&C's EBITDA blipped down from $113 million to $111 million on a revenue decline from $280 million to $271 million). Admittedly, those numbers were helped by a faster growth rate, including some acquisition-related growth - but directionally speaking, the firm weathered the black-swan scenario without taking too many bruises.At the end of the day, the services provided are completely non-discretionary - if you run a fund, you can't just decide not to pay your fund administrator one month - so the risk is really more funds going out of business or having their mandates pulled.In fact, the risk that I'm actually more worried about here is this: I think some aspects of SS&C's platform - particularly for less complex smaller/medium-sized funds - could be replicated a little more easily than founder-CEO Bill Stone or ardent bulls might admit. For example, when I was vetting fund administrators for my firm, I heard a lot of good things about Opus Fund Services, although I decided to go in a different direction myself. Over time, I also wouldn't put it past Peterffy/IBKR to develop more robust internal reporting capabilities and displace the need for some of SS&C's offerings, although as of right now, I think anyone who uses IBKR (me included) would tell you that they're nowhere near having the user-interface chops to match their development/automation prowess.Final ThoughtsWhether you use company guidance or analyst estimates, SS&C appears to be trading at a little over 18x this year's earnings. With leverage at 4.6x times consolidated EBITDA, that's hardly a bargain multiple, and it gets even worse if (like me) you choose to count stock-based compensation as a real rather than fictional expense.While I may stick to conservative fundamentals-oriented value investing, it's certainly not the only way to make money - and as far as high-priced but high-quality companies with a strong competitive advantage and a long runway for value creation go, SS&C ranks up there pretty highly. Just from driving improvements at Citi and other ""inbuilt"" opportunities, I think SS&C can drive double-digit earnings growth for at least the next few years - and strong cash flow will allow the company to delever as it has in the past with its LBO and other acquisition sprees. High leverage will likely be the norm, though; once the company has balance sheet capacity again, I expect another round of dealmaking.Is this enough to make me a buyer here? No - but I like the story quite a bit and am inclined to step outside my usual comfort zone with a bullish angle here despite the debt-fueled acquisition strategy. SS&C is a unique company with a unique opportunity set, and I think growth-oriented investors would do well to consider it.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

Aided by 29 tuck-in acquisitions since 1995, the company has amassed a broad product portfolio that allows its clients to manage complex processes, including fund accounting and reporting, performance measurement, trade processing, and compliance, across various asset classes. The company plans to raise $150 million by offering 10.7 million shares at a proposed range of $13-$15. J.P. Morgan, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank are acting as joint bookrunners on the deal, which priced on Tuesday, March 30 and will list today on the NASDAQ under the ticker ""SSNC.""Impressive FundamentalsSS&C Technologies has a track record of profitable organic growth and has shown success recognizing synergies from acquisitions. This has helped the company drive 23% top-line CAGR since 2004, reaching $271 million in sales and $110 million in EBITDA (41% margin). The model is highly scalable, which combined with the firm's solid base of recurring revenue (85% of sales) and impressive 90%+ renewal rates, allows for high visibility and strong free cash flow. The company expects demand for its products to increase given the need for greater transparency and potential regulatory changes in the financial industry, and aims to capitalize on this trend by continuing to expand its customer base both organically and through M&A as well as cross-selling to its large installed base of more than 4,500 clients.Key IssuesThe financial services industry is still recovering and revenues are in part tied to transaction volumes and AUM of clients. These factors caused organic revenue growth to decline 7% in 2009. SS&C also faces direct competition from much larger firms, such as State Street, SunGard, PNC Bank and BNY Mellon. Finally, international sales, which represent a key long-term growth driver, declined as a percent of sales each of the last two years (fell 11% in FY09).Valuation at a discountDespite the SS&C's strong margin profile, the stock is being valued at a discount to its peers across virtually every metric (i.e. 21x trailing P/E vs. 26x for the group). This combined with the recent strong performance of the group, which has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past month, should help to drive strong investor interest in the deal at the proposed $14 midpoint. We also highlight MSCI's pending acquisition of RiskMetrics for $1.6 billion (13.6x 2010 EBITDA), and believe there is potential for further consolidation in the space as these firms attempt to increase market share, which would likely provide an additional tailwind for the sector."
1549462,40031,2013-07-15T15:49:02-04:00,,"SS&C Technologies (NASDAQ:SSNC) is on a growth path, benefiting from numerous acquisitions and overall industry trends. The company has grown earnings and revenue at a rapid pace recently, with both top and bottom line growth accelerating for several quarters. The company intends to reap further benefits from continuing industry consolidation as it swallows smaller competitors, expands its market presence and increases synergies with the already acquired companies.Company overviewSS&C Technologies is a leading provider of mission-critical, sophisticated software products and software-enabled services that allow financial services providers to automate complex business processes and effectively manage their information processing requirements. The company's portfolio of software products and rapidly deployable software-enabled services allows its clients to automate and integrate front-office functions such as trading and modeling, middle-office functions such as portfolio management and reporting, and back-office functions such as accounting, performance measurement, reconciliation, reporting, processing and clearing.SS&C provides solutions globally to more than 5,500 clients, principally within the institutional asset management, alternative investment management and financial institutions vertical markets. In addition, the company's clients include commercial lenders, corporate treasury groups, insurance and pension funds, municipal finance groups and real estate property managers.Accelerating growth mainly through acquisitionsSS&C has acquired 38 companies since 1995. The acquisitions brought new products and services which added to the company's revenue and earnings. The June 2012 acquisition of GlobeOp Financial Services was the biggest acquisition for the company so far, and has positioned the company as the world's largest independent fund administrator. The GlobeOp acquisition extends the company's reach to hedge fund clients. The results of acquisitions can be seen in substantial earnings and revenue growth. Adjusted earnings growth accelerated in the last four quarters, from 16.7% in Q1 2012 to 60.7% in Q1 2013, while revenue growth accelerated from 5% to 85% in the same time period. The company has delivered robust top and bottom line growth rates in prior years, and is expected to keep growing in the future. The management guided for $175 million to $179 million revenue for the second quarter of 2013, and full year revenue of $712 million to $722 million range. Analyst expectations are roughly the same, with consensus estimates in mid-range of the company's guidance. Adjusted earnings guidance for the Q2 2013 and the full year were $0.45 and $1.85, respectively. Those numbers translate into 30% growth rates for both adjusted earnings and revenue.Growth strategy and opportunitiesSS&C's key growth strategy elements include:1. Continuing development of software-enabled services, cloud bases software and mobility. The company's product team works closely with marketing and client service personnel to make sure that product evolution keeps up with the developments and trends in the marketplace. Management believes that SS&C enjoys a competitive advantage because it can address the needs of high-end clients by providing industry-tested products and services that enable clients to automate and integrate their front, middle and back-office functions for improved productivity and bottom-line savings.2. Expansion of the client base. The company has more than 5,500 clients, which represents a small fraction of total number of financial services providers globally, so there is an opportunity to grow substantially in the future.3. Increased revenue from existing clients. Revenue from existing clients can grow along with the amount of assets that they manage and the volume of transactions they execute. In addition, the company intends to sell additional products and services that will enable it to increase revenue from existing clients.4. Further acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies. SS&C intends to continue the acquisition strategy in order to broaden its product and service offerings and add new clients. The company seeks to acquire businesses (at a reasonable valuation) that are complementary to the current products and services, which will help the company to better serve its customers and grow revenue and profits.5. Strengthening of the company's international presence. SS&C generated 24% of revenue from clients outside North America in 2012. The company is building its international operations to increase sales outside North America. There are opportunities in the rapidly growing alternative investment management market in Europe, and Asia is another potential growth market for the company.6. With the acquisition of GlobeOp, a higher percentage of SS&C's clients are hedge funds or funds of hedge funds. And that could be a solid growth driver in the future, especially with the latest news - the SEC ending an 80-year-old ban for hedge fund ads.SS&C is well positioned to benefit from the growing industry trends globally. As assets under management keep increasing and as there is a growing need for more sophisticated systems to automate functions such as trading and modeling, portfolio management and accounting (among many other functions), the company is in the sweet spot to gain from such trends.Risks1. SS&C business is greatly affected by changes in the general economy and the financial markets. Adverse changes in the economy and the financial services industry could have a very negative impact on demand for the company's products and services. The global economy has experienced a severe recession over the past several years, which had an adverse effect on the financial markets. The recovery since the recession is fragile and could slip into another deep recession. SS&C's clients' success is linked to the health of the economy and the financial markets, and they can in turn cancel, reduce or delay expenditures for the company's products, impair their ability to pay for purchased products and cause them to process fewer transactions. A drop in clients' assets could also adversely affect SS&C's revenue and profit since pricing in many agreements is adjusted on assets under management.2. The financial services software and services market is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. The market is also highly fragmented, and while it is an opportunity for the company to grow by acquiring smaller competitors, the smaller competitors are targeting only local markets and specific client types and may have a competitive advantage over SS&C. The company's top competitors are State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT), Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS) and Bank of New York (NYSE:BNY). Those are formidable names, but the management believes that SS&C is able to move a little quicker and has more focus and transparency.3. The company's aggressive acquisition strategy may pose difficulties, since it may be hard or impossible to integrate the acquired company successfully. The anticipated benefits may not be realized, such as lower costs, increased revenue, synergies and growth opportunities.4. The aggressive acquisition strategy caused an increase in indebtedness. Total debt exceeded $1 billion by end of 2012, as a result of an additional $900 debt arrangement in order to complete the acquisition of GlobeOp and PORTIA. That leaves the company vulnerable to rising interest rates and that in turn can limit the company's ability to borrow additional funds and can reduce the availability of cash to fund further acquisitions. It can also reduce the company's working capital, capital expenditures and R&D efforts.For the time being, the company is very successfully managing those risks, since it is grabbing market share and growing revenue and profits, acquiring and successfully integrating acquired businesses, and generating strong free cash flow and paying down debt. The management noted in the latest conference call that the company has paid down $180.6 million of debt in the 10 months after the GlobeOp acquisition.Valuation and upside potentialSS&C currently trades at a forward PE of 17.60. Given the strong growth trends and rising analyst estimates, the company can easily command higher multiples. I believe there is a substantial upside opportunity for the stock despite the sharp rise in the share price. As the company continues to execute their plans ahead of expectations, and there are perhaps more acquisitions (the management hinted of a few smaller ones in the near-term and did not exclude the possibility of a bigger acquisition), it is certain that the analyst expectations and company guidance would rise under such circumstances, which would deflate the forward valuation and give the stock more room to grow. However, the share price looks overbought and extended at the moment, and a pullback to the $33-$34 range would be a good opportunity to initiate a position.Source: Stockcharts.comConclusionSS&C is firing on all cylinders. The company is reaping benefits from last year's acquisitions, as the integration process of acquired companies goes smoothly. The earnings and revenue growth have accelerated in the last four quarters, and the above average growth is expected to continue, although not at the last quarter's hot pace. Shares could be bought after the stock pulls back to the $33-$34 range, where it might find support from the rising 50-day moving average line.Sources: SS&C SEC filings, Q1 2013 Conference Call TranscriptDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SSNC over the next 72 hours.

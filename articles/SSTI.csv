The cities that have the best use cases for the service are already clients or have gone with competitors.Despite years of effort, international sales have failed to materialize.SSTI revenue growth is already slowing as new competitors take market share.Insiders take out over 10% of the company's annual revenue in compensation.Fair value is 60-70% lower than the current market price.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ Short Ideas subscribers - find out more here.In 1992, Robert Showen was inspired to begin an engineering project by the sound of gunfire in East Palo Alto. According to an article by Forbes, he developed a system to triangulate the location of gunfire based on sound waves in 1994. Robert Showen's current LinkedIn profile shows that he started at ShotSpotter (SSTI) in 1996.Like many companies founded during the .com bubble, ShotSpotter achieved some limited success but never really took off. Between its founding and March 31, 2017 (the date corresponding to the disclosures in the S-1 filing), ShotSpotter's client list grew to 89 cities and the company covered a total of 450 square miles. Reported revenues were $11.8 million in 2015 and $15.5 million in 2016, the net loss was $6.2 and $2.2 million for those years. The accumulated deficit was $89.2 million as of March 31, 2017. This is an unimpressive track record for a company that had been in business for 20 years and had the backing of several venture capital funds including Lauder Partners and Motorola Solutions.To fund its losses, ShotSpotter raised ~$76m as a private company through 2014, mainly through a series of private placement venture rounds.Source: CapitalIQLauder Partners, a California-based Venture Capital firm, was an early backer of ShotSpotter as far back as 2004. Currently, Lauder Partners and Gary Lauder, the founder of the firm, own ~19% of SSTI equity. Motorola Solutions owned 15.6% of ShotSpotter prior to the company's IPO. Given the disappointing financial results and low revenues, it is likely that the venture partners grew tired of funding the business. To exit, they had a few options:SSTI management attends many small and microcap conferences throughout the year and I have met the company multiple times at these conferences. In discussing the history of the company with CEO Ralph Clark, I learned that ShotSpotter did in fact attempt to sell itself prior to the IPO could not find a buyer at an agreeable price.When there are no strategic acquirers, where do venture funds turn when they need to exit their investment in a consistently unprofitable business? In the public stock market, of course! SSTI went public in May of 2017 at a valuation of about $105m ($11 IPO price x 9,532,924 shares), which amounted to an eyebrow-raising 6.5x trailing revenue. Revenues continued to grow, the stock got caught up in the great technology bubble of recent times. According to S&P CapitalIQ ownership data, Motorola took advantage of the rally to sell out of their entire SSTI position by the March quarter of 2018. Several other venture funds and insiders also significantly reduced their stakes in the IPO and shortly afterwards.Source: SSTI S-1 FilingDespite the VC funds selling, the stock continued to rally, and the valuation peaked at an eye-watering 25x Enterprise Value to Sales ratio during the third quarter of 2018. In order to buy stock at such a high valuation, investors needed to believe that SSTI has a huge addressable market and a sustainable competitive advantage that would allow it to grow rapidly for years and achieve persistently high profits. The sell side was happy to feed this narrative. The initiation report by Tim Klasell at Northland, for example, says that ""We estimate the company has addressed only 10% of its market for US Law Enforcement with sales efforts into international and campus settings in early days. We also believe the solution, distribution and brand can be leveraged into adjacent markets quite easily.""I believe that this rosy assessment is very far off the mark. Most of the truly addressable market consists of a handful of reasonably wealthy American cities with a gun violence problem contained within a concentrated geographic area. The largest American cities are already using ShotSpotter or one of its competitors, and many others have already evaluated ShotSpotter and decided not to adopt it. Despite years of effort, the company has failed to gain traction outside of the United States because most major foreign cities either have limited gun violence or have far more urgent priorities for their law enforcement budgets. Even more significantly, competitors are emerging and winning market share. For these reasons, SSTI's revenue growth is already slowing significantly.Contrary to the rhetoric of certain high-profile politicians, violent crime has fallen precipitously in the United States in recent decades. According to annual reports published by the FBI and charted by the Pew Research Center, the rate of violent crime fell by 51% between 1993 and 2018.In ShotsSpotter's most recent investor presentation, management identified a total market size of over $1 billion per year. Management attributed about 60% of the total potential revenue to a domestic opportunity set of 1,400 U.S. cities billed at $400,000 per year, which is about 4-7 coverage miles based on the Company's billing of rate quote.Source: 2018 FAQ sheet produced by SSTIFor the sake of comparison, the full cost of hiring a new police officer in Phoenix, AZ is $109,000 in salary and benefits and $12,000 in equipment, according to the city's budget director. That means that a city installing the system could hire about 3 additional officers for the price of adding ShotSpotter in a 4.25 square mile area. To make this worthwhile, the city will need to have certain hotspots for gun violence and the budget to both pay for the system and the police officers to respond to the calls.To analyze ShotSpotter's current client list and prospects, I looked at several factors:Based on my research, I believe the Company's addressable market estimation is wildly unrealistic.ShotSpotter's top two clients are New York and Chicago, which together represent about 35% of the company's revenue. Shooting injuries per square mile averaged about 8 and 56 in New York and Chicago, respectively, which is far above average. In New York, the problem is geographically concentrated, which makes it ideal for limited deployment where cost is based on the covered square miles. In addition, both cities have large law enforcement budgets that allow them to purchase ShotSpotter's products without having to make significant cuts elsewhere.Source: William Blair's SSTI report dated September 2018The website The Trace is an independent third-party and free service that provides maps and data of gun-related incidents in American cities. Using this website, I examined the maps of the largest cities in the United States examined which ones were current or former clients of ShotSpotter. In these maps, yellow dots represent gun injuries and red dots represent reported gun-related deaths. These images are unaltered except for the green boxes I added to point out specific hotspots for gun violence. I tried to keep city scales consistent for the sake of integrity. I broke down the opportunity set for SSTI into high/medium density shooting clusters, high/medium population cities, and large/medium budgets. Here are some prominent examples.New York (high density, high population, large budget):Source: The TraceChicago (high density, high population, large budget): Source: The TraceThese cities are both very large and have unusually dense injury clusters, which allows SSTI's products to potentially help police detect more crimes. This is a critical criterion - using SSTI's expensive products (more on that below) in more widely dispersed cities is simply not economical.With few exceptions, if a city has a notable gun problem, ShotSpotter is already deployed there or was already evaluated and rejected. To estimate the total market size already tapped by SSTI, I took a top-15 sampling of the U.S.'s largest metropolitan areas, as measured by the Census Bureau, and combined it with online local news archives and SSTI's investor information. Based on my research and without extrapolating beyond the top-15 metropolitan areas by population, I estimate about 28% of U.S. metropolitan areas, as weighted by population size, are already customers or have evaluated and rejected ShotSpotter.Source: my internet research, Census Bureau, The TraceOne notable rejection came from the city of Philadelphia, whose high density, high population, and large budget stats should make ShotSpotter a no-brainer for the city.Source: The TracePhiladelphia has a long history of declining ShotSpotter's product pitch, dating back to 2008. Most recently, the city opted to give its business to one of SSTI's competitors, Safety Dynamics. According to city officials, Safety Dynamics' cost, design, and scalability were superior to ShotSpotter's audio-only offering:One category of city that is likely outside of SSTI's reach is those with high density injury clusters, high populations, but small budgets. New Orleans is the exemplar of this category. It installed the system in 2008 with support from the FBI but ended the program after the federal money dried up. FBI Special Agent John Selleck is quoted in the linked article, saying ""In New Orleans, it may have been that they needed officers in patrol vehicles first before they could make the expenditure on the technology.""Source: The TraceMost of the large and dense cities with well-funded police forces and concentrated areas of gun violence are either current ShotSpotter clients or have deployed competing solutions. The next best set of potential customers consists of cities with more dispersed shooting problems and smaller law enforcement budgets. Houston is one notable large city that is not a ShotSpotter client. The map indicates that its gun violence problem is not geographically concentrated. Source: The TraceSome other medium-density cities, such as Sacramento, Louisville, San Antonio, and Nashville signed on with ShotSpotter, but have had trouble justifying the product's cost due to lack of tangible results. Sacramento and San Antonio have dropped the service, and it is likely to fall victim to a round of budget cuts in Louisville. Plans to implement the system in Nashville have been canceled.Sacramento Source: The Trace""It boils down to money.""Louisville""Louisville Metro Government must redirect $35 million to pension obligationsâ¦LMPD will respond by cutting three recruiting classes and ending ShotSpotter.""San AntonioSource: The Trace""ShotSpotter was no longer worth the price tag.""Nashville Source: The Trace""Metro Nashville Police Department now says their limited manpower and resources could be better used in other ways.""Finally, there are cities with high population, medium budgets, but low density injury clusters. I believe these cities simply do not have a large enough problem with gun violence to merit paying for ShotSpotter's system. Cities like San Jose, Portland, and Seattle fit this category. This leaves the Company competing for the handful of low population cities with high density injury clusters and the budget to pay for ShotSpotter, such as Camden, NJ and Canton, OH. These opportunities are necessarily smaller, and they are limited in number.After reviewing the evidence, it is abundantly clear that the 1,400 city at $400,000/year TAM is a fantasy. The cities with the best use case for a shot detection system are already clients or have opted for competing solutions, and the company will have a more difficult time selling to cities with lower rates of gun violence, lower density, and/or lower budgets.Since the IPO, part of the bull case for ShotSpotter has always been the prospect of selling the system to big cities outside of the United States. The 2018 10-K spells this out:Outside of the United States, we estimate that the market for our ShotSpotter Flex includes approximately 200 cities in the European Union, Central America, the Caribbean, South America, and Southern Africa that have at least 500,000 residents. We estimate that a customer in this market could invest an average of approximately $1.0 million per year for our public safety solution.Despite some serious sales efforts, ShotSpotter has not managed to make much progress outside of its home market. The 10-K notes that the company has ""only one currently deployed ShotSpotter Flex customer outside of the United States in South Africa"" but that ""we just signed a contract in early 2019 with the Bahamas."" Rio de Janeiro tested ShotSpotter but later abandoned it, while Recife used a local competitor. Birmingham (UK) tested the system in 2010 but did not adopt it. The company's lone success in trying to sell to major cities outside the US appears to have been Cape Town, South Africa, which signed on in 2016. I believe that ShotSpotter's poor sales record in non-US markets is caused by the same issues that have hampered its progress in the United States: many major cities don't have a chronic gun violence problem, but most of the ones that do have more urgent priorities for their law enforcement budgets.ShotSpotter was created to detect gunshots, and that has been the focus of the company over its entire history. Safety Dynamics, a private company that sells the SENTRI II system and won business in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and a livestock show in Houston, appears to have a similar business model. I believe that there is a significant chance that this market is about to turn in a different direction.The concept of ""smart cities"" has been gaining a lot of traction recently. The term is something of an overused buzzword, but, in general, it means the use of networked sensors and computing to increase efficiency in urban areas. The benefits may include traffic monitoring and management, improvements in energy efficiency, and detection of problems for maintenance. Large companies, like Signify, AT&T, and Verizon are investing in products and services that fit this category. Similarly, a new company called Wi-fiber has developed a new multi-purpose product called the 'Intelli-platform' that directly competes with ShotSpotter. The Inteli-platform is placed where a streetlight would ordinarily go but serves many functions, includingAccording to DigitalTrends, the product won best in show in the Smart City category at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2017.Canton, Ohio recently replaced ShotSpotter with Wi-Fiber. City officials noted that Wi-Fiber covers a larger area at a lower cost, provides both audio and visual recording, and because the city owns the sensors, it can move them easily on their own. The change in vendors appears to have been triggered by SSTI trying to raise prices by 5%:To adapt to the move toward smart cities, ShotSpotter has partnerships with GE Current, Verizon, and AT&T to incorporate its gunshot detection solution into streetlights and other infrastructure. However, these partnerships have not yet yielded significant results. On the 2018 Q2 conference call, CEO Ralph Clark noted that ""we had our first Smart City deployment with GE Current in Atlanta"" during the quarter. Since then, they appear not to have made any more progress, which CFO Alan Stewart alluded to on the Q4 2018 earnings callThe move toward networked sensors and devices across cities is gaining momentum. I believe that there is a significant risk to SSTI that shot detection simply becomes an add-on for smart city hardware and service deployments sold by larger companies, which will put pressure on both the company's revenue growth rate and gross margins. Capital IQ data shows that the average gross margin for communications equipment suppliers with market capitalizations between $50 and $500 million is about 40% over the last 12 months, which is significantly below ShotSpotter's trailing gross margin of 58%.I have argued that most of the best targets for SSTI's technology are already on the platform or are using a competing product and that competition is growing more intense. If both these points are correct, ShotSpotter's revenue growth should be slowing - and it is:Source: CapitalIQ, My CalculationsSource: CapitalIQ, My CalculationsIn addition to churn caused by competitive pressure, ShotSpotter has historically lost clients because of budgetary pressures or because local police forces decided that system simply isn't worth the cost. Charlotte declined to renew their contract with the company because, according to a memo authored by the city council, ""based on its experience with the system, CMPD feels the return on investment was not high enough to justify a renewal."" The city noted that the system did not help the police to make arrests, and they believed that the money could be better spent on cameras. A new budget proposal by the mayor of Louisville would eliminate funding for ShotSpotter to make up for a budget shortfall. Steve Conrad, the Police Chief, defended the ShotSpotter program but noted that if they are forced to choose what to fund, ""officers [are] more important to stopping crime than anything else."" Sacramento also ended its contract with SSTI this year due to budget pressures. In response to questions, a SacramentoPolice Spokeswoman said that ""it's not idealâ¦ but the money had to come from somewhere."" These examples show that not all police departments have found ShotSpotter to be effective at fighting crime, but even those that do are likely to prioritize their payroll over renewing their contract with the company if they are facing a budget shortfall.Some recent data points to an economic slowdown in the United States. If this trend continues, local tax receipts are going to fall, as they have in the last two recessions, and ShotSpotter could be one of the first things to get cut from the local budget.Source: FREDIn a recession, I think it is likely that ShotSpotter's revenue growth could turn negative.Between 2016-2018, SSTI insiders made over $8.2m of compensation according to S&P's CapitalIQ data platform, including $4.6m in 2018 alone. This compares to total revenue over the same time period of $74m and total net losses as reported of ~$20m.Source CapitalIQ compensation dataSource: Capital IQ compensation data and company filingsFor each of the last three years, SSTI's board and named executives received between 8 and 13% of total revenue as compensation. These are lucrative compensation packages for such a small company, particularly one that has historically lost money. Investors reviewing this information can reach their own conclusion, but from where I'm sitting it's hard to argue that such generous compensation is in the best interest of shareholders, and the amount of compensation has been increasing every year. If this trend continues, shareholders who own SSTI under the thesis that the company is going to leverage G&A expense as it grows are likely to be disappointed. Furthermore, activist efforts to change compensation are unlikely to be successful. The board is staggered in three classes of directors, making it difficult for shareholders to gain control of the board. From the SSTI proxy:In my experience, a staggered board suggests a lack of shareholder orientation and an entrenched management team, which implies that the chance that this company will reduce SG&A as a percent of revenue in response to pressure from shareholders is low.ShotSpotter emphasizes its software and subscription revenue model in its 10-K filings. For example, the 2018 10-K says, ""The Company offers its solutions on a SaaS-based subscription model to its customers."" While I acknowledge that ShotSpotter does include software as part of its service offering, I do not believe it should be valued like a SaaS or other software business. The appeal of the software business is that the marginal cost of making another sale of an existing product is tiny, which allows companies in this industry to maintain very high gross margins and leverage SG&A and R&D expenses as they grow. ShotSpotter installs acoustic sensors (hardware) in specific neighborhoods for its clients and runs an Incident Operations Center to process the output from the sensors and communicate with law enforcement. According to management comments on the earnings calls, the sales cycle can take anywhere from 1-2 years depending on the size of the city and police department. For these reasons, SSTI will not be able to leverage expenses and expand its operating margins like a software business. Instead, I believe that the relevant industries for valuation comparisons are communications equipment and technology services.Using CapitalIQ, I calculated the average trailing EV/EBIT and EV/Sales ratios for two groups of companies: Communications Equipment and the combination of IT Services and Data Processing and Outsourced Services. For both groups, I included only US-listed companies with market capitalizations between $50 and $500 million. The results are below:Source: Capital IQ, my calculations. Only profitable companies are included in the harmonic mean EV/EBIT ratio calculation.It is worth pointing out that an EV/EBIT between 14 and 22 implies a P/E ratio between about 18 and 28 assuming no debt and a 21% tax rate. This is clearly a growth multiple rather than a multiple for a mature company. In order to apply these valuation ratios to derive a valuation for ShotSpotter, I used what I consider to be unrealistically optimistic assumptions for the company:Those get me to the following numbers:Source: My CalculationsAs of the time of this writing, the market price of SSTI is $19.66. The table below shows my calculations of the fair value of ShotSpotter shares using the valuation ratios from the peer group, a discount rate of 10% over 2.25 years, and an assumed free cash flow of zero through the end of 2021 (the existing cash balance of $27.4 million is added back to the enterprise value to derive the market capitalization).Source: My CalculationsAs with any forecasting and valuation exercise, it's easy to disagree with my assumptions, but it takes a lot more than minor tweaks to justify the current valuation of ShotSpotter!In order to be bullish on ShotSpotter at anywhere near current prices, an investor needs to believe that the company has a long growth runway and a unique competitive position that is going to give it durable pricing power. In this report, I've laid out evidence that competition is growing more intense, city governments and police departments are price sensitive and likely to cut the service when they need to tighten the budget, and the company has already captured the best markets for its product in the United States, making the path to further growth more difficult. In addition, despite years of trying, ShotSpotter has made very little progress selling its product outside of its home market.SSTI shares have sold off dramatically over the last 6 months, but that certainly does not make it cheap. My analysis suggests that it has a lot further to fall before it hits a reasonable valuation.Further ReadingThere is a lot of good material published on this company on the internet. For both bears and bulls, I'd recommend Fuzzy Panda's write up, which documents a court case in which ShotSpotter was deemed inadmissible as evidence, a long investigative report by Forbes, a more recent article by Jacob Ryan with the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting, and a much older profile of the company and technology by Wired."
4292911,104099,2019-09-22T21:53:48-04:00,"The short on Shot Spotter has been a bumpy, painful, but ultimately profitable ride. I'm closing it out.
        The company has gone from massive loss in the first half of 2018 to slight profit in 2019, which is quite a feat.
        The company is now a buyout candidate and, for that reason too, I'm walking away.","Since I published my bearish piece on Shot Spotter Inc. (SSTI) last December, the shares are down ~27%, against a gain of ~11.5% for the S&P500 over the same time. Iâve developed a proprietary indicator that I call the âSeeking Alpha Vituperative Indexâ, and it suggests the more angry the other side of your thesis gets, the better. Given that one of the keyboard warriors who reacted to my earlier article wrote âNICE SHORT IDIOTâ (always with the capital letters), I knew I was on to something. Anyway, all gloating aside, I think it necessary to revisit the name because as shares drop in price, the risk to shorts grows ever greater. In addition, the company actually produced net income over the past two quarters, which is also problematic from a shortâs perspective. Finally, I think a very compelling case could be made to suggest that this $200 million company is now a buyout candidate. All of this adds up to me closing my position. Iâll go through my reasoning below.A quick review of the financials here reveals the same themes that I went through in my earlier piece. While revenue continues to accelerate, reflecting politicianâs desires to look like theyâre âdoing somethingâ about gun violence, costs generally continue to rise apace. Dilution continues also, with share count increasing by a whopping 12% in the first six months of 2019 alone (!). That said, the company has managed to deliver net income for the first time in its history and that is very significant in my view. Comparing the first first six months of 2019 to the same period a year ago shows that Shot Spotter managed to go from a massive loss to a slightly positive net income. Objectively speaking, that is quite a feat.Source: Company filingsIn my home town, politicians have scrapped plans to adapt Shot Spotter to deal with growing (by Canadian standards) problems with gun violence. The problem is that fears remain about Shot Spotter technology being used to eavesdrop on private conversations, and that has raised concerns that the potential benefits of this technology (i.e. being told that shots have been fired) were outweighed by potential costs of this technology (i.e. that it abets a police state). In my view, if a government like John Toryâs Toronto is concerned about civil liberties encroachment, I am very skeptical that municipal governments that actually care about civil liberties will get on board here.Also, I will admit that worrying about the potential privacy impact of something like Shot Spotter is a bit rich, especially in the Toronto case. There are far greater infringements on the privacy of Torontonians than this technology. For example, while Toronto Mayor John Tory decries this technology, heâs done nothing to address the surveillance cameras that showed up in Toronto for the G-8 Riot...sorry...""Summit"" 9 years ago and have, unsurprisingly, never been taken down. Further, companies like Facebook, Google etc. pose far greater risk to personal freedoms in my view. This isnât the point, though. If politicians can cancel Shot Spotter as a low cost signal to voters that they care about civil liberties, they will do it. It does very little to improve our privacy rights, but it puts on a good political show at the cost of Shot Spotter shareholders.Looking at the business is only one half of the equation in my view. Valuation is at least (if not more) important in my opinion. For that reason, I must spend some time looking at the stock. In my view, it remains morbidly overpriced,This is a point I tried (but likely failed) to make to the longs in my earlier article. If a stock is priced for perfection, that is by definition a poor investment. The reason for this is that sooner or later the company will not execute perfectly and the shares will drop. For example, investors may decide that a sale to the City of Toronto is a foregone conclusion, so they drive the share price higher. They are disappointed when their expectations are dashed. For this reason, itâs generally a good idea to avoid shares that are very optimistically priced.One of the ways I use to judge whether shares are optimistically priced is price to free cash flow. The more an investor pays for a dollar of future free cash, the lower their expected returns going forward. All of the narratives about future greatness are, in a sense, âbaked inâ to this metric. The following is a chart of the companyâs price to free cash flow history, and, in my view, it speaks for itself. Although the shares arenât as expensive as they were a few months ago, they remain objectively expensive relative to the overall market and to countless other companies.Source: GurufocusTo sum up so far, we have a business that has made a dramatic financial turnaround in the first six months of this year compared to last, and a stock that has underperformed the overall market by about 38%. While I think the stock remains massively overpriced, I have to admit that the stock market is often driven by illogical forces (see the comment section of my first Shot Spotter article for evidence). In addition, this is a company with only a $200 million market cap that has just turned a profit, and a company like Parsons Corp. (PSN) may at some point buy Shot Spotter for the technology. For that reason, Iâm closing my short position on Shot Spotter. In this circumstance, Iâd normally suggest that people who insisted on remaining long here switch to call options, as such vehicles give investors much of the upside at far less risk. Unfortunately, there are no publicly traded options on this name, so investors are either âall inâ or âall out.â For my part, Iâm now all out.Shot Spotter has been an interesting case study in my view. It certainly proved the worth, yet again, of my own âSeeking Alpha Vituperative Index.â It also demonstrates the dangers of narrative investing in general, as the fact is that the world can change faster than an investorâs narrative adapts to the change. The company has managed to turn a profit recently, and thatâs troubling from a shortâs perspective. In addition, given that the company now sports only a $200 million market cap, it is certainly a buyout candidate, which is also troublesome from a shortâs perspective.. For these reasons, I must close out this position. While I think the shares remain massively overpriced, on balance thereâs more risk here than reward, so Iâm walking away."
4327010,25120,2020-02-25T14:54:58-05:00,"ShotSpotter has seen continued revenue gains in recent years, although growth has been underwhelming a bit in 2019.Growth is set to accelerate in 2020 with further margin gains seen this year.I still like the long term potential, though sales multiples have expanded quite a bit again.Current times might not be best suited for a speculative position, but above-average volatility in the share price provides for occasional opportunities.","ShotSpotter (SSTI) is a name I have only covered once, just after it went public in the summer of 2017. I ended up concluding that the company was a risky, yet potentially lucrative IPO. Shares ended up increasing a factor of five times in little over a year, and ever since have come down quite a bit again. While the company has seen continued growth and is profitable, I am no buyer here just yet, with expectations having increased a bit again following a decent momentum run in recent years.When I looked at ShotSpotter at the time of the public offering, I observed a very interesting company, as its solutions can make huge differences at low costs. The company's gunshot detection solutions allow cities, enforcement and security staff to rapidly respond to shootings as the costs of providing (a sense) of safety are low in relation to the benefits. This made me conclude that while this business was highly speculative, it could be lucrative as well.I was compelled to the technical details of the solution, the effectiveness and the employment of a SAAS business model. At the time the company had 74 customers across 89 cities, as the potential market was high with 330,000 cases of gun violence taking place per annum at the time in the US alone. The company believed there was a potential target market of $500 million based on 1,400 cities having the potential to use the services at a cost of $400k per year.The company went public at just $11 per share, valuing the company at just $100 million, including a modest net cash position of $15 million. The company was just very small with revenues totaling $15.5 million in 2016, while it reported an operating loss of $5.0 million. I was compelled to the 50% growth rate reported for the first quarter of 2017, as this resulted in an annualized sales mark of $20 million with real leverage made on the bottom line. The fact that the solution brings real benefits and revenue multiples seemed modest, with sales being that strong, made that I saw the appeal of the shares, although the business was somewhat risky a well. That conclusion was correct as a momentum induced rally made that shares traded at $60 in 2018, with me having sold out on the shares at $30 already.Early 2019 shares traded near the $50 mark when the company released the 2018 results. The company reported a 46% increase in sales to $34.8 million and reported a modest net loss of $2.3 million. The 11.7 million shares made that operating assets were valued around half a billion, indicating that valuation multiples have expanded from about five times sales at the time of the IPO to 15 times sales, even as the $45-$47 million revenue guidance issued for 2019 looked compelling.Some strange events took place as the company actually issued some shares in March of last year, only to announce a share repurchase program two months later, without much of a share price decline to defend this rationale.Shares fell towards the $20 mark this autumn. In November the company reported third quarter results which revealed sales up just 8% year-over-year with sales up 19% in the first three quarters of the year. Note that the previous quarters have been softer as well, the reason why the full year outlook now stood at sales of $40-$40.5 million, a dramatic cut compared to the initial outlook for 2019.With 11.5 million shares trading at $20, the operating asset valuation came in around $200 million, making that sales multiples had been reduced to five times again. The company reported tiny profits but was essentially breaking even. While 2019 was softer than expected, it was somewhat encouraging that the company outlined a $48-$50 million sales guidance for 2020, with margin expansion seen as well. That resulted in relative appeal already, although earnings multiples are not really indicative.The fourth quarter results are somewhat encouraging as revenue growth accelerated to 12% year-over-year. Encouraging is that the 2020 guidance is reconfirmed and that the company managed to report operating earnings of $1.2 million for the quarter, resulting in annualized true earnings of about $0.40 per share.These results triggered a rally to $36 at the moment of writing, pushing up operating asset valuations to about $400 million, or eight times forward sales and about 100 times earnings. Thus, we can hardly call shares cheap at this point again, although the above average volatility of the shares makes that this remains a very interesting stock. Hence, I certainly look forward to buying again at a 5-6 times sales multiple, with earnings growth anticipated as well."

The company has solutions deployed in approximately 100 cities and generates annual subscription revenues from the deployment of their technology on a per-square-mile basis. Several cities have benefited from this technology and have extended their relationship with ShotSpotter. This article outlines the growth opportunity ahead for ShotSpotter, but also elaborates on the risks and concerns an investor must bear in mind before making a decision.The Opportunity Is StrongShotSpotterâs target market is large and its competition is limited. Based on the companyâs estimates, there are approximately 1600 cities worldwide that can benefit from the technology.Moreover, the company also offers its gunshot detection and alert technology to commercial establishments, school/university campus and other areas of public gathering. The market is big and ShotSpotter is the only major player in this space.Source: Company PresentationRevenue GrowthSince becoming a publicly traded company, ShotSpotterâs top line growth has been strong. Revenues increased 46% YoY in FY2018 in comparison with FY2017 and the gross margins have also increased in the past three years.The company has also reached the brink of profitability with FY2018 being the first year with positive EBITDA of $2.23 million. The company is forecasting a top line between $44.5 million to $45.5 million.Expansion Of BusinessNot only is ShotSpotter providing services to new customers (cities), but cities that are currently using ShotSpotter technology have been extending their contract for additional coverage.The company name and technology is spreading through word of mouth and shooting incidents often get reported in the news as âpolice officers responded to a ShotSpotter alert...â thereby increasing the awareness of this technology among the general public.The city of Chicago is a large customer for ShotSpotter with a 3-year contract (extendable to 5) for a value of $23 million. This amount could increase depending on future extensions and/or coverage area expansions.Kansas City initially started using ShotSpotter technology through a federal grant sponsored pilot program back in 2012. The city is now paying approximately $164,000 a year with city officials confident that the technology is helping reduce crime.ShotSpotter has also partnered with GE (GE) to integrate their outdoor sensors, along with other technologies, into street lighting systems that help cities collect data and improve their operations. Recently, they have partnered with Verizon (VZ) to bring the ShotSpotter solution to cities by leveraging Verizon's Light Sensory Network, an IoT platform deployed on street lights.The above points are illustrative of ShotSpotter demonstrating strong growth and having a strong moat in an area with huge opportunity. We shall now see the issues and concerns I have with this company.The Technology Is Not Fully MatureThere are two issues associated with any technology that performs detection and estimation.A false positive alert is one where a non-gunfire incident is reported as gunfire. This could result in an unnecessary rapid deployment of police officers and first responders, which may raise unnecessary fear among the occupants of a community or facility, is seen as a waste of police and first responder resources.False Negative is the event of a failure to alert law enforcement or security personnel in the event of an actual gunfire and could result in a less rapid or no response by police officers and first responders, increasing the probability of injury or loss of life.Numerous reports claim that false positives are a major issue with ShotSpotter technology.Forbes performed a study in late 2016 by collecting data and other records from more than two dozen customer cities around the country. In 30-70% of the cases, in the event of a ShotSpotter alert, police officers were unable to find evidence of gunshots.Source: ForbesSince gunfire detection technology is the bread and butter for this company, the maturity of the technology and accuracy of the detection is of paramount importance to see any form of continued growth and market penetration.Though this study of false positives was performed in 2016, below sections will indicate that this problem still remains unsolved to a large extent.Leaving CustomersThe lack of maturity of the technology is causing several customers to stop their subscription to ShotSpotter services. Fall River, Massachusetts recently ended their relationship with ShotSpotter after the technology had repeatedly missed several gunfire shots (false negatives).In the past, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police had decided to not renew their $160,000 a year contract with ShotSpotter, claiming that the gunshot detection system didnât help them make arrests or identify crime victims.While there are several city officials claiming ShotSpotter is the reason crime is reducing in their communities, there is no real study that has proven ShotSpotter to be the reason for declining crime. Most cities contracting with ShotSpotter do not own the data that ShotSpotter produces, and the company has not made that data available for study. I believe it is important that ShotSpotter must prove effectiveness by making the data/reports available to demonstrate crime reduction if any.This May Be The First To Go During Budget CutsShotSpotter technology has demonstrated its ability to reduce the time taken for first responders to arrive at the scene in the event of a gunfire. Moreover, it aims to provide supplemental information to the dispatch officers in the form of type of weapon, number of armed shooters, etc.Several city officials are seeing ShotSpotter technology as a nice-to-have, but not as a must-have capability. The Louisville Metro Police Department is expected to cut ShotSpotter as the department faces nearly $6 million in cuts as part of the mayor's budget proposal for next year.Rockford, IL police officers and city officials are pleased with the reduction in gunfire incidents since the deployment of ShotSpotter technology. However, with funding being tight, a committee of police officers, police commanders and crime analysts is being formed to review the effectiveness of ShotSpotter in helping police stop gun violence before deciding whether the system is worth the cityâs continued investment.These reveal that in the event of a budget cut, ShotSpotter could lose several cities from its belt and it could prove detrimental for the growing company.Revenue ConcentrationIn FY2018, ShotSpotterâs two largest customers were the City of Chicago and the City of New York and they accounted for 22% and 15% of the total revenue respectively (Source: Company FY2018 Form 10-K)Since almost 37% of the top line comes from two cities, this brings concerns of revenue concentration since cutbacks due to budget cuts could sharply affect the top line of ShotSpotter.Upgrading Wireless SensorsApproximately half of the installed ShotSpotter sensors use fourth-generation (â4Gâ) Long-Term Evolution (âLTEâ) wireless technology and half use third-generation (â3Gâ), cellular communications.US wireless carriers will be discontinuing their 3G services towards the end of 2022, resulting in ShotSpotter sensors to not be able to transmit on these networks. Due to this, ShotSpotter will have to upgrade the sensors that use 3G cellular communications at no additional cost to customers prior to the discontinuation of 3G services. (Source: Company FY2019 Form 10-K)This represent significant capital expenditures in the next 2 years which will affect margins and impact profitability of the company.Privacy ConcernsGovernmental agencies and private citizens have become increasingly sensitive to government or third-party surveillance equipment allowing end users to listen to private conversations and monitor private citizen activity.Recently, the City of Toronto, Canada decided against using ShotSpotter solutions because the Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario indicated that it may compromise Section 8 of Canadaâs Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which relates to unreasonable search and seizure.Though the company claims that âOur sensors are not designed for âlive listeningâ and are triggered only on loud impulsive sounds that may likely be gunfire,â there are several past incidents where ShotSpotter footage and audio have been utilized in investigations. Citizens are still concerned about private conversations being picked up by the company's tech.Growing privacy concerns can lead to reduced adoption by cities. Moreover, with new regulations being rolled out to protect the privacy of individuals, ShotSpotter could be forced to change the way detects gunfire and this could mean trouble for the company.ValuationTrading at 236x EBITDA, ShotSpotter has a very rich valuation.Data Source: Wall Street JournalMoreover, as the company is expected to report a profit in FY2019 and the forward P/E stands at 99.14.Axon Enterprise (AAXN) is a supplier equipment and technology for law enforcement agencies and is in my opinion, a good candidate to compare with ShotSpotter. AAXN has a forward P/E of 51.13.ShotSpotter's forward earnings multiple is high even when compared with fast-growing technology names like:Source: FinvizShotSpotter has demonstrated strong growth in its top line and is rapidly expanding into more cities. While the growth story is great, the investment thesis is muddied by privacy concerns and concerns over maturity of the technology. Moreover, at the current prices, the stock is too expensive for me to look past the risks and see the reward. Hence, at this time, I am not convinced to recommend ShotSpotter to investors."
4226298,104099,2018-12-04T16:01:20-05:00,"In my view, there's little reason to buy ShotSpotter Inc. at these levels.In spite of a history of ongoing losses, the shares trade at a ridiculously rich premium.My advice to current shareholders is to follow the lead of Michael Price and get out.","Over the past twelve months, the shares of ShotSpotter Inc. (SSTI) are up about 180%. In my view, investors would be wise to take their gains and run at this point. I'll go through my reasoning by reviewing the brief financial history here and by looking at the stock itself. I'll also make an appeal to authority, acknowledging that not all investors are created equal. The bottom line is that there's just too little value or opportunity here to warrant the valuation in my view.ShotSpotter is the leader in gunshot detection solutions, which help law enforcement officials deter and prevent gun violence. The company offers a cloud-based SaaS model to customers in the United States and South Africa. ShotSpotter Flex is deployed in high crime areas and helps deter firearm violence by accurately detecting and locating gunshots and sending near real-time alerts to law enforcement.In my view, this company generates revenues based on a multi-decade fear of firearm violence. In my view, Hillary Clinton's somewhat racist quip about ""Superpredators"" back in the 1990s reflected a time that was actually much more violent. In spite of a tragic recent uptick, gun violence in the United States has actually been on the decline since the early 1990s, while fears seem to be rising. In my view, this disconnect between the reality and the fear represents a threat to this company. If fears abate, the market may slow their adoption of this technology.A quick review of the short financial history here suggests that ShotSpotter is a growth company. Over the past few years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 26% and gross profit is up at a CAGR of 49%. This is obviously impressive growth. The problem is that this is where the good news ends. For instance, R&D, sales and marketing, and the catchall ""G&A"" expense are up at a CAGR of 17%, 7.5%, and a whopping 46% respectively. It seems that as the company grows, various expenses grow, too. In fact, in 2015, these three expenses represented ""only"" 90.6% of revenues. As of the most recent fiscal year, they represent 92%. Thus, growth seems to beget losses. In fact, net loss has grown at a CAGR of about 17% over the past three years.On the bright side, loss per share has declined drastically, but that's because dilution has been fairly massive. Shares outstanding has grown at a CAGR of about 67% since 2015. Another possible bright spot is the fact that the loss has been reduced somewhat in the first nine months of 2018 relative to the same period a year ago.Source: Company filingsIn my view, there's going to be continued losses with this business for some time. That may not disqualify the stock from consideration, though. In the same way that a great business can be a terrible investment if the investor overpays, a subpar business can be a decent investment if the price is sufficiently low. For that reason, I need to spend some time looking at the stock itself, as a thing distinct from the business itself. Unfortunately, the stock is ridiculously priced in my view, relative to the fundamentals of the business. There is no free cash flow, but on a price to operating cash perspective, the stock is morbidly overpriced in my view.Source: GurufocusThe fact is that some investors are more skilled than others for a host of reasons. Some have better training than most. Some have emotional advantages that allow them to ignore much of the noise that we hear in markets. For that reason, it behooves the rest of us to pay attention to these people when they make a trade.With that in mind, I'd point out that twelve months ago, Michael Price purchased 292,116 shares of ShotSpotter. Over the next nine months, as the share price rose, he reduced the position, and as of last September, records indicate that he's sold out. In my view, this is indicative of a sentiment from this money manager that we should be aware of.In my view, the shares of ShotSpotter are massively expensive, especially in light of the ongoing losses the company seems to generate. Quite apart from whether the technology works or doesn't, this is a poor investment in my view because paying a large premium for ongoing losses is never a good idea. This is perhaps why a talented institutional manager like Michael Price bought and very quickly sold this stock. I think price and value can remain unmoored for a prolonged period of time but will inevitably meet. In my view, investors would be wise to get out now before price falls drastically to meet value."
4352451,21815,2020-06-08T02:23:38-04:00,"The company has an attractive business model that generates decent cash flow already and tiny profits.However, worries about the true size of its TAM, declining growth and emerging competition have cooled our enthusiasm from a few years back.The shares seem fairly fully valued to us at present, even if the impact of the pandemic isn't too bad.","At first sight, it isn't all that hard to make an investment case for ShotSpotter (SSTI);But there are also concerns the TAM might not be as big as management believes, and growth is tapering and likely to be further affected by the current pandemic and the worsening of state and local finances. Serious competition is also emerging.ShotSpotter has developed a system of sensors and AI that uses audio triangulation in order to register, locate and analyse the use of firearms on a large (even city-wide) scale. This enables the police to act faster and come more prepared, as 80% of gunshots are never notified to 911. Its forensic reports are admissible in court, so they help with prosecutions and ambulances can arrive faster.The company has developed additional applications like Missions, Patrol Management Software which optimizes the location and deployment of resources.ShotSpotter's business model is an attractive SaaS model, but as an article from shorts Mako Research pointed out, this is a bit of an exaggeration. While the SaaS part is true, each new installation still requires significant (and manpower-intensive) hardware installations (microphones) and permits, greatly reducing the inherent operational leverage suggested by emphasizing the SaaS model.The performance over the years has been good. This is a growth stock with recurring revenues, and it's actually profitable:Data by YChartsHowever, there is a worrying tapering of growth:Data by YChartsGrowth is supposed to come from:The company's tech is installed in over 100 cities and municipalities, with roughly 760 square miles under surveillance contract (covered by nearly 17K sensors).ShotSpotter touts a $1 billion+ TAM. From the earnings deck:However, this thesis hasn't gone unchallenged. The above-linked Mako Research article claims that the TAM is much smaller, mostly limited to parts of cities which combine highly concentrated shooting incidents with high police budgets.The company struggles with cities with lower and/or dispersed shooting incidents and lower police budgets, according to Mako, and as such, the low-hanging fruit has already mostly been consumed.Given the notable decline in growth, we fear that Mako might be onto something, although the growth slowdown might also be at least in part the result of growing competition from companies like Raytheon, Shooter Detection System LLC, Thales Group, Safety Dynamics and Wi-Fiber.Safety Dynamics' SENTRI system works not only with microphones, but these activate cameras in the case of a shooting incident. From the website:The rising competition argument makes sense, as ShotSpotter's growth has fallen below that of the industry. From Research and Markets:Wi-Fiber has at least one competitive win against ShotSpotter in that Canton, Ohio, didn't renew its contract with ShotSpotter and went with Wi-Fiber instead, and we have to admit that its Intelli-Platform looks interesting. From Digital Trends:Even more interesting is how it might have worked in the case of Las Vegas (which is considering implementing it) with the terrible mass shooting from 2018:The modularity and added functionality (camera and speaker integration) look to be serious competition for ShotSpotter.Mako Research mentioned something else that might emerge as competition: Smart City initiatives. The advent of 5G is going to rapidly accelerate these developments, and cities are likely to become plastered with all kinds of sensors in order to regulate traffic, monitoring air quality and energy savings, etc.ShotSpotter partnered with GE's Smart City initiative all the way back in 2015, integrating its sensors into GE's smart streetlights. From The Verge:It seems that San Diego included both in their Smart City project in 2018, but GE sold its Smart City business (named Current) to Ubicquia in 2020, and that article mentions other city implementations of the platform (called CityIQ):Both Atlanta and Schenectady look to be ShotSpotter customers, but they are not on the list of customers, and neither is Portland, so these trials or evaluations or whatever exactly went on didn't conclude in successful deployments (or ShotSpotter's list is not up to date). So we can't call that partnership with GE a big success.From the earnings deck:Missions operates in two cities already, with another four having been booked. However, the onboarding process requires boots on the ground, which hasn't been possible during the pandemic lockdowns.International growth has been rather disappointing so far, with deployments limited to Cape Town in South Africa. The company established subsidiaries in Mexico and Brazil, but these two countries are seriously impacted by the pandemic, which complicates the sales process substantially.There are a number of ways the pandemic is impacting the company:ShotSpotter has developed a new playbook for its sales process and customer engagement tailored for the new environment, complete with high-quality Zoom sales presentations. From the Q1CC:The company also embarked on a customer success program which is receiving $200K investment per quarter, and a new CRM system in order to take a more proactive stance with respect to contract renewals (as management expects attrition to rise from 2.5% to 5% as a result of the pandemic). It has given a customer some flexibility with payments, which helped a deal get over the line, even though it was already closed last December but the municipality developed some funding problems due to the pandemic.Guidance (see below) has been lowered as a result of the pandemic, and management expects the heavy strain on municipal budgets to reduce opportunities for the company, although Federal budget aid could be a wildcard. Without Federal aid, these budgetary problems could persist for quite some time.Gun violence is not affected by the pandemic, and gun sales are actually up. The riots that accompanied some recent demonstrations, while boosting gun sales and gun stocks, are not likely to impact the company all that much.ShotSpotter was able to add a net 5 square miles covered, boosting revenues 9% to $10.5M (y/y). The company signed the US Virgin Islands as a new customer and Puerto Rico went live with 5 square miles covered, but 4 miles in Atlanta weren't renewed and 20 miles in Albuquerque, a new city for the company, experienced delays, although 5 of these have gone live in April, which was done remotely - a not insignificant achievement.On the other hand, the trial in Houston hasn't gone forward because pandemic made it difficult to have boots on the ground. Progress has been made with design and permissions, and the project can resume when the lockdown clears.Net income was $14K and adjusted EBITDA $2.2 million. Both were up from last year (a loss of $0.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million).The outlook for 2020 revenue has been reduced to $43-46 million (from $46-48 million), which is still 9% at midpoint.Data by YChartsThe tremendous increase in gross margin has stalled, but there still seems to be at least some operational leverage, even if Q1 saw a little retreat due to the investment in the company's customer success program and higher insurance costs. From the earnings deck:Data by YChartsCash flow has improved considerably and is now consistently positive. ShotSpotter has a strong balance sheet with $28.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter, up from $24.6 million. The company has no debt.Share-based compensation doesn't seem excessive to us, and neither is dilution, given the fact that the company is only recently cash flow-positive.Data by YChartsData by YChartsAnalyst expect EPS of $0.09 this year, rising to $0.21 next year. Needless to say, on an earnings basis the valuation is tremendous, but that is supposed to come down through operational leverage.As so many others, the stock has been buffeted by the pandemic, but for ShotSpotter, the effect might last a while longer depending on whether there will be Federal aid to stretched municipal finances.We do think the shares are fairly fully valued and worry a bit about growth and competition, even in the absence of the pandemic. While the hyper-growth days are well and truly over, the company is now producing meaningful cash flow, and this is likely to expand once growth resumes to more normal levels after the pandemic.Perhaps the company could start to use that cash for dividends or buybacks, or there might be attractive investment opportunities left, like integration with smart city efforts."
4222809,102078,2018-11-16T09:45:00-05:00,"The Simmons court case is a case every SSTI investor must read & that Wall Street hasn't commented on yet.
        Simmons testimony & forensic data reveals flaws in ShotSpotter's technology - SSTI failed to spot the shots; forensic data was edited days later after requests from police.
        NY Judge ruled ShotSpotter data inadmissable - calling it unreliable scientific evidence.
        Disclosure changes show SSTI relying more on humans than software.
        9.5x Sales is an unsustainably high valuation.","The Silvon Simmons case we recently uncovered reveals the many flaws of ShotSpotter (Nasdaq: SSTI) and why we are short the company. In Silvon Simmons, a police officer shot an allegedly armed black suspect (Simmons) in the back. The officer & suspect had 2 different accounts of what happened: the officer said the suspect had a gun and fired at the officer before he shot Simmons in the back, while the suspect said he was unarmed and never fired at the officer. The prosecution hinged their case on a ShotSpotter report saying there were 5 shots fired. Ultimately, the Judge ruled ShotSpotter data inadmissible, labeling it as âunreliable scientific evidence.â Simmons was acquitted and is now suing ShotSpotter and the police (Case - 6:17-cv-06176-MAT).The ShotSpotter deficiencies that Simmons revealed included unreliable data and results that could be modified after the fact. In addition, other courts have refused to admit ShotSpotter data because the technology has not âreached general acceptance in the scientific communityâ (State of California vs Gillard - pg 54 line 27-28), principally because SSTI has not done the work to get their results confirmed by independent analysis.The Simmons case not only casts doubt on the integrity of the companyâs data, but it also sheds further light on fundamental problems with ShotSpotterâs technology. For example, ShotSpotter initially mistook the gunshots in Simmons for the sound made by helicopter rotors. They failed to spot the shots. Only when the Police Department informed ShotSpotter that shots had been fired did they generate a report. That report said 4 shots were fired, so the police department informed SSTI of the officerâs story and requested them to look for more shots. Then, ShotSpotter employees modified that same forensic report (the âevidenceâ) againâdays after the eventâto say 5 shots had been fired.This case and others have been overlooked by sell-side analysts, who maintain buy ratings and high price targets despite SSTIâs astronomical valuation (9.5x P/Sales). ShotSpotter's financial disclosure changed showing that even in cases of an interruption of service with their IRC that humans, rather than their software, are always reviewing & reporting possible shots fired. This is perplexing, since the company markets itself as a SaaS business.Perhaps it is the flaws mentioned above that have led ShotSpotter to have difficulty retaining and growing their city customer base. Even after giving the product away for free for almost a year, ShotSpotter was unable to convince a customer to become a recurring payer! Fall River precinct decided against re-upping their contract after free service from SSTI because, according to the police chief, âShotSpotter had reported too many false alarms of gunfire while missing actual shots-fired incidents in Fall River.â (Source)ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system. The companyâs marketing materials say that the technology detects at least 90% of gunshots fired within their deployment zones (a year ago, that ratio was 80%). Another part of SSTIâs offering is that they provide detailed forensic reports and expert testimony that are meant to bolster investigation and prosecution. The overall viewpoint of customers is that it worksâitâs just a question of how useful it is. Some police chiefs love it (Baltimore) and others find that resources can best be deployed elsewhere (San Antonio Police Commentary). District attorneys we have spoken to are especially fond of the technology, since it enables them to play the sounds of live bullet fire inside the court room. They say it is a powerful tool for swaying the emotions of jurors.The bull case on ShotSpotter is predicated on the company expanding its areas of coverage within existing cities, which ShotSpotter have done well so far, and on more cities signing up for ShotSpotter, which they have struggled to execute. There are also long-shot hopes of a big data play & federal government contracts, which have failed to materialize and which the company now downplays (source). Bullish investors believe that the company will finally earn an operating profit and generate positive FCF, something they have failed to do for over 20 years. Since their revenues are recurring in nature (although most are 1-year contracts), ShotSpotter has also gotten a SaaS company valuation multiple (9.5x sales) from Wall Street, despite the fact that humans are actually doing the analysis, not software.The cases of NY State v. Silvon Simmons and the follow-on lawsuit Silvon Simmons v. Ferrigno, City of Rochester, and ShotSpotter, et al (Case - 6:17-cv-06176-MAT) are an important challenge to the prevailing ShotSpotter investment thesis. Not only do these cases question the validity of the technologyâs results, but they also allege that ShotSpotter changed its report (âevidenceâ) multiple times to comply with requests from local police. Furthermore, as part of these proceedings, the NY judge ruled that ShotSpotter data âwas not reliable enoughâ to be the sole physical evidence in the gun possession charge against Simmons.Legal cases are essential to analyzing ShotSpotterâs effectiveness because the company avoids allowing media or investors to analyze actual data. It does this by blocking Freedom of Information Act Requests and avoiding subpoenas (pg 10 paragraph 44). Thus, court documents and testimony provide a rare glimpse into ShotSpotterâs trade secrets & process.Was it 4 or 5 shots fired? A Manâs Life Hung in the BalanceSilvon Simmons is ultimately a dispute over 1 bullet. If there were only 4 shots fired, then Simmonsâ story was true: he was a defenseless black man shot in the back by a cop who has received over 20 citizen complaints, many for use of excessive force (Pg 38 - Paragraph 264). However, if there were 5 shots fired, then the copâs story was correct: he shot a fleeing suspect in self-defense after Silvon had fired first.Simmons was ultimately acquitted of attempted aggravated murder against a police officer. He is now suing ShotSpotter, the police officers involved, and the City of Rochester for, among other things, âfabricating and falsifying evidence.â (pg 30 2018-Q3-10Q)Forensic evidence that supports Silvonâs story.Forensic evidence substantiating the officerâs story of a 5th shot:The reliability of ShotSpotter evidence comes into question because, according to the testimony of ShotSpotter paid expert Paul Greene and the forensic report itself, the analysis was actually changed multiple times after communicating with the local police force (ShotSpotterâs customer).Thatâs right! ShotSpotter âforensic evidenceâ was altered twice.ShotSpotter Change #1 â The ShotSpotter system did not catch the shots fired in real time. The critical gunshots from this case were originally mistaken for sounds from a helicopter. As a result, ShotSpotter only discovered the shots when Rochester PD contacted ShotSpotter and gave them a specific time & location of the weapon discharges. ShotSpotterâs system failed to do its one core job â detect gunshots.Below is Paul Greeneâs own testimony from the case (Paul Greeneâs LinkedIn).Source - Simmons vs ShotSpotter Inc, etc. 6:17-cv-06176-MAT (source)ShotSpotter Change #2 â ShotSpotter then reported that the Simmons incident involved 3 to 4 shots fired. However, after being contacted by the Rochester PD, who asked the ShotSpotter team to look for a 5th shot, ShotSpotter changed the report. The final report matched the police officerâs testimony.Source - Simmons vs ShotSpotter Inc, etc. 6:17-cv-06176-MAT (source)Below is evidence from the Simmons case, never before reported on by a sell-side Wall Street analyst, which shows multiple changes to ShotSpotterâs own forensic report. These adjustments to the evidence occurred in the days after the shooting.Misclassification as Helicopter Noise & Reclassification as 3 Shots, Then 4 ShotsChange From 4 Shots to 5 Shots After Police InstructionSource: People of NY vs Silvon Simmons - Motion in Limine Indict No 16/404 pg 20, 26 (source)This begs the question: what other ShotSpotter forensic evidence can be changed upon request?From further testimony by Paul Greene, the expert witness for ShotSpotter, investors learn that subscribers (police stations) and ShotSpotter are actually able to edit the audio data.Simmons vs ShotSpotter Inc, etc. 6:17-cv-06176-MAT (source)If ShotSpotter data can be altered by multiple parties, how trustworthy is it?In a 2017 attempted murder trial in San Francisco, Paul Greene testified that ShotSpotterâs claim of 80% accuracy was invented by the marketing department.In Silvon Simmons, the NY judge ultimately ruled that the ShotSpotter data was inadmissible to be the sole physical evidence in the case, a huge blow to ShotSpotter.In another case in California, State of California v. Todd Gillard, California Judge John Kennedy ruled ShotSpotterâs location data and Paul Greeneâs testimony inadmissible because ShotSpotter has ânotâ¦reached general acceptance in the relevant scientific communityâ. (pg 54 ln 20-28 â State of California vs Gillard case No 05-164004-0). Despite Judge Kennedyâs ruling, which stipulated that ShotSpotter needed to have objective studies conducted and reviewed to meet the general acceptance requirements of the Kelly-Frye Rule, SSTI has failed to initiate such studies. (pg 54 ln 1-19)Instead, ShotSpotter has coached cities on how to DENY Freedom of Information Act requests (Memo to SSTI Customers, Birmingham, AL denials) and have even avoided supplying data in response to subpoenas (pg 10 paragraph 44). Allowing the release of data would enable courtsâand investorsâto verify how accurate ShotSpotterâs technology really is.If you are a defense attorney looking to keep ShotSpotter data out of your courtroom, you now have some powerful admissions from Paul Greene at your disposal:To roll out ShotSpotter in new cities, SSTI needs both city governments and the public to be on board. The service is a large cost for police departmentsâ stretched budgets, so it needs to be both accurate and a net benefit for the community.What the Simmons cases highlight is:The sales effort to get new cities on board is falling short. SSTIâs bull case is predicated on more cities signing up for ShotSpotterâs service; however, the number of sales to new customers (cities) has slowed to a crawl. The company has added only 5 net new cities in over 2 years, which amounts to 2.4% annual organic city growth.City count in July 2016 was 90, with 4 out of the 10 largest cities in the US (link). City count as of Q3 2018 was 95, with only 3 out of the 10 largest US cities (pg 18-Q3-10Q). Recent news reports published since show ShotSpotter has also added Toronto, Canada; and a pilot in Columbus, Ohio. Accordingly, we think they will report a Q4 2018 city count of 97.Issues brought to light by former customers compound the problems already mentioned to make SSTIâs sales effort challenging. Some recent anecdotes from canceled customers:Another large risk comes from ShotSpotter having a majority of their customers on 1-year contract terms (pg 17 â 2018 Q2-10Q). Thus, if dissatisfaction becomes widespread, the company could quickly see the number of cities and miles of coverage decline.SSTI markets themselves to Wall Street as a SaaS (Software as a Service) Company. This has resulted in the companyâs receiving a lofty valuation of 9.5x Sales. However, in Q2 2018, SSTI added an additional step to its description of the Incident Review Centerâs (IRCâs), which is the human element of their solution, reporting process for gunshots during an interruption or delay in service. They are removing automatic software notifications even in the case of an interruption in service which reinforces how ShotSpotter's approach is, in reality, a very human-based process.These disclosures suggest ShotSpotter may not trust its âsoftwareâ not to send false positive alerts. SSTI software will always still detect a potential shot fired and the location but now even in cases of an interruption of service with their IRC humans, rather than their software, are always reviewing & reporting possible shots fired. False positives have long been a major complaint of the companyâs customers. After reviewing data from 7 cities, Forbes reported that âpolice were unable to find evidence of gunshots between 30-70% of the time.â (source)If the company doesnât trust its own software to automatically send alerts, then how can public markets give ShotSpotter a software-sized valuation?We are short ShotSpotter because:The insights into ShotSpotterâs flaws gained from the Simmons case shoot holes right through the Wall Street bull case."
4151235,24589,2018-02-27T14:22:56-05:00,"This revaluation and expansion story continues to play out.I provide a recap of the bullish thesis.We take a closer look at Q4 earnings.I remain a big fan of management`s conservative, open approach with investors and Wall Street.I conclude that readers who purchase here will be rewarded for their patience as adoption of their gunshot technology continues.","Shares of gunshot detection firm Shotspotter (SSTI) have risen by 40% since initially presenting the idea to readers last year as Â¨the right IPO at the right timeÂ¨. The stock has risen by just 7 % since my January update.Readers are aware that when searching for stocks with near term upside I stick mainly to the biotech arena with a smattering of tech ideas. Tech can be quite lucrative as well, although sometimes ideas can take longer than anticipated to play out. On the other hand especially with recent IPOs there are opportunities for quick appreciation due to such stocks being under the radar before getting a few publicly reported quarters under their belts.The gunshot detection firm came to capital markets at a very opportune time, and I was interested even more by the acceptable initial valuation (4 to 6 times sales) which implied serious upside should adoption of the technology accelerate. I liked that management appear to be conservative with guidance, which serves as a stark contrast to other firms where executives overpromise and then fail to meet guidance. I cited the potential addressable market of $1.4 billion and encouraging earnings to date, which led me to believe the stock was still undervalued and their technology in the early stages of adoption.A recent event that I believe strengthened the thesis significantly was the agreement with Verizon (VZ) to bring ShotSpotter's technology to cities by leveraging Verizon's Light Sensory Network (IoT platform deployed on street lights). I stated that this agreement appears to be a win-win for both firms, but especially for the smaller company by giving it a foothold in cities already implementing or soon to utilize Verizon's Light Sensory Network (not to mention leveraging the larger firm's vast resources for expansion).Political tailwinds are likely to aid the stock in addition to horrifying headlines that highlight the urgent need for solutions to gun violence. A recent article pointed out that 18 school shootings had occurred to date as of February 20th! Lately there`s been much political pressure for solutions - I won`t take one side or the other but will state I hope some kind of legislation takes the issue head on instead of continuing to kick the can down the road. In the meantime, Shotspotter`s technology remains an imperfect measure but one which should nevertheless be implemented and see continued adoption.The company recently reported fourth quarter and full year results- for the fourth quarter revenues grew 43% to $6.5 million as a result of Â¨new customer deployments, expansion of miles covered with existing customers and strong customer renewal ratesÂ¨. Gross profit rose 56% to $3.2 million while net loss came in at $2.5 million. Cash and equivalents totaled $19.6 million along with $15.8 million in short-term deferred revenue. Management has guided for full year 2018 revenue in the range of $31 to $33 million, a slight upward revision from when it was last given.Other measures of note include the annual revenue retention rate of 141% (versus 127% for 2016) and addition of 23 net new Â¨go-liveÂ¨ square miles of coverage. The first measure I believe provides the proof that Wall Street was looking for, namely that their technology is accomplishing its set objectives and clients are Â¨stickyÂ¨. New clients start with a small pilot project, generally like what they see, expand coverage and renew contracts as they can see first hand the value being created. The second measure was more than double that reported in the fourth quarter of 2016 (11 net new Â¨go-liveÂ¨ square miles).I continue to expect the Verizon deal to pay big dividends in the future, and on the conference call management noted that first deployments with GE/AT&T in Atlanta are in progress with the experience likely to aid the company when work with Verizon gets underway. I find it refreshing how management remarks on what they are learning during these deployments as opposed to pretending they have it together- this ability to learn and evolve with the market and their partners should create value for shareholders going forward.While I constantly remind readers to take analyst ratings with a grain of skepticism, it`s worth pointing out that Northland raised their price target to $30 after fourth quarter earnings were reported, citing high renewals and profitability likely to be achieved by the fourth quarter.A few days ago two officers at the company scooped up some shares on the open market and this should be looked on positively. Institutional buying activity is far outweighing selling as well (over 2.1 million shares in increased positions versus 393,000 shares in decreasing positions). New positions initiated amounted to more than double those that were sold out.Readers who have done their due diligence and are interested in the story should purchase a pilot position in the near term. I suggest taking a Â¨buy the dipsÂ¨ approach as long as the thesis remains intact.One risk is the possibility of a slowdown in adoption and revenue growth, which would be devastating to the bullish thesis. If there is a trend of clients who do not renew their contracts going forward, that lack of ""stickiness"" would also be a nail in the bull thesis. Publicity (negative or positive) could play an outsized role in awareness of this technology and public perception, and the possibility of future partnerships (or failure to obtain them) is also a point to consider. A successful partnership leveraging Verizon's capabilities could result in plenty of upside in 2018, while hiccups along the way (or a parting of ways) would weigh on shares.In response to readers' requests, I am preparing to launch the ROTY Marketplace service on Thursday, March 1st (see my preview blog post).

4200275,21815,2018-08-18T08:49:20-04:00,"Customers love ShotSpotter's service, and this is spreading through word of mouth.The company still has a large market opportunity in front of it, both domestically as well as internationally, but it is moving away from indoor deployments.While SSTI is at the cusp of profitability, shares have fallen out of their upward trend channel, so we would be a little cautious with buying here.","ShotSpotter (SSTI), the innovative acoustic detector of gun violence, had a good quarter, but shares have sold off pretty substantially.They are almost down $10 from their 52-week high just a week or so ago, although they're more than 3x the IPO price ($11) of just over a year ago. What's going on?Well, there wasn't really anything wrong with the quarterly figures, even if management argued that lumpiness makes a fairly unreliable guidance of the underlying pace of growth.But there was growth and pretty comprehensive as well. From the Q2 10-Q:The company still has a large market to go after, both nationally and perhaps even more internationally.Nationally, the company is focusing especially on customer satisfaction as its experience (and logic) has it that word of mouth - for instance from one police commissioner to another - is still the best sales channel powering revenues.And the market might be bigger than just the obvious high gun crime cities. For instance, the company could receive an order from Toronto, not a city known for its gun violence, but where one incident activated the city council to free budget for ShotSpotter.Management added that there are lots of cities known to be fairly safe, but which nevertheless have some rough parts where there is a ready market for its services.The company is also actively working with its partners GE (GE), AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) on smart city deployments, and it could even save some deployment costs, depending on which company puts up the infrastructure (it might be able to coattail on the smart city vendor for this).The company has a first project with GE in Atlanta, but this isn't yet generating revenues, and it doesn't expect that for this year, but remain cautiously optimistic for next year.The encouraging thing is the ShotSpotter app is usually the application that generates most interest by cities for these types of deployments.Drones might even be another opportunity, and management is actively studying this. This could also offer some competition though, as Axon (NASDAQ:AAXN) (formerly Taser) partners with drone manufacturer DJI for analytical drones for police usage.Internationally, there are also good opportunities, and the company is actively engaging in Latin America. It has already deployed a few miles in Cape Town, South Africa, which functions as a show piece to drive further sales. From Q2CC:Sales usually start when the company establishes a few operational miles as it gets the other parts interested. And there are other opportunities which one might not think of first (Q2CC):While the sales cycles for international markets tend to be longer, they generate higher revenues (Q2CC):There was also some bad news. The company wrote off three indoor sensor deployments and no longer includes indoor coverage as a part of its service offering, which could lead to more write-offs.This despite having just been awarded a patent for its indoor sensor technology, so we have to say this comes as a bit of a surprise, and we're not sure about the reasons behind the decision.Management is considering partnering with indoor players (it mentioned Shooter Detection Systems as a company it's looking at) possibly for combined solutions.SSTI Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThere is a gradual increase in gross margin, and Q2 wasn't an exception as it expanded to almost 56%. There were a few reasons for that:Operational cost still increased a bit faster than revenues, but according to management, this is going to change from this quarter onwards, so there will be some operational leverage going forward.SSTI Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsCash from operations was a positive $1.4M, and the company's balance sheet is still relatively healthy with $14.8M in cash (up slightly from the end of Q1) and no debt.The company issued the following guidance for the full-year 2018 (slightly up):The shares are still rather expensive, needless to say:SSTI EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsAnalysts expect an EPS of -$0.18 for this year rising to a positive $0.21 in 2019.If you are worried about all the trade troubles, this is a stock to look at. The company has a large market in front of it, both domestically as well as internationally.Revenue growth is torrid, and although this could come down a bit simply because of the law of large numbers, we still think the company will be growing at a very high rate for some time to come.The simple truth is that its customers seem to love what the company provides, and this is spreading through word of mouth. Until something better comes around (which we don't exclude), we think this is a fairly safe investment.However, technically the upward trend is broken (see chart at the start of the article), we'll have to see whether shares can re-establish an upward trend, so don't go all-in at once (something we don't recommend in general anyway)."
4141507,24589,2018-01-31T01:21:51-05:00,"The stock has risen by 35% since my initial write-up.Initially I was interested due to a reasonable valuation and high growth prospects in a market that appeared to be in its infancy.Management continues to execute, including signing up new clients, expanding coverage with existing accounts and paying down debt.The agreement with Verizon was a brilliant strategic move that will allow the small company to leverage the larger firm's infrastructure and resources.Readers who have done their due diligence should purchase a pilot position in the near term and take advantage of dips after the quarterly report (if they come) to add to their positions.","Shares of former ROTY-holding ShotSpotter (SSTI) have risen by 35% since I initially presented the recent IPO to readers in the middle of last year.Figure 1: SSTI daily advanced chart (Source: Finviz Elite) (Disclosure: Contains affiliate link)The gunshot detection firm came to capital markets at a very opportune time, and I was interested even more by the acceptable initial valuation (4 to 6 times sales) which implied serious upside should adoption of the technology accelerate. Readers will recall that while in ROTY most of my ideas are in the biotech arena, we are not limited to that sector. In this case, I believed that excessive optimism and news headlines could also drive the share price to a premium.In August I wrote about their first quarter reported as a publicly-traded company, noting that revenue growth of nearly 50% and raised guidance were encouraging. I liked that management was ""sandbagging"", as opposed to overpromising and then disappointing Wall Street. Lastly, I cited the potential addressable market of $1.4 billion (and cut that figure in half for the sake of being conservative). In light of that figure and the firm being in the early stage of the growth cycle, I concluded that the stock was still undervalued.In mid-September the company announced seven new cities had recently deployed ShotSpotter's technology (Cincinnati, Jacksonville, Louisville, Newburgh, Pittsfield, Syracuse and St. Louis County). Another encouraging development was that three key cities (New York City, Chicago and Birmingham) expanded their coverage areas (implying they were very satisfied with performance so far).Figure 2: Chicago case study of initial adoption and expansion (source: corporate presentation)On November 6th Gilder Gagnon Howe reported a 15.24% passive stake in the stock. Another positive development was the addition of William Bratton to the Board of Directors in mid-November (technically reappointed as he served prior in 2013)- he also serves as Vice Chairman for the Secretary of Homeland Security's Advisory Council and has close ties to key police departments due to prior law enforcement experience (including as Commissioner of the New York City Police Department). In late January the stock jumped as a result of inking an agreement with Verizon (VZ) to bring ShotSpotter's technology to cities by leveraging Verizon's Light Sensory Network (IoT platform deployed on street lights). Verizon's solution already offered such services as traffic analytics and public safety support, so the addition of gunshot technology makes decent sense. The end result will be making it much easier (and likely lower cost) for cities to implement gunshot technology as well as coveraging many more square miles. Thus this agreement appears to be a win-win for both firms, but especially for the smaller company by giving it a foothold in cities already implementing or soon to utilize Verizon's Light Sensory Network (not to mention leveraging the larger firm's vast resources for expansion). Figure 3: Attractive revenue model (source: corporate presentation)An upcoming catalyst will be their earnings report on February 20th. For the third quarter the company reported a cash position of $19.3 million (down from $35.1 million), but keep in mind that they repaid outstanding debt of $13.5 million (now debt free). Net loss for the quarter was minimal at $1.6 million, while total operating expenses rose by 56% to $4.2 million. Revenues increased 70% to $6.8 million, while gross profit more than doubled to $3.4 million. Gross margin rose to 50% (from 40%) and 50 square miles of ""go-live"" coverage were added (net 17 square miles as compared to 11 for the same quarter last year). Keep in mind that discontinued square miles (33) were a result of hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Management guided for 2018 revenue in the range of $30 million to $32 million, while 2017 guidance was raised to $23 million.ShotSpotter continues to offer an attractive business model where they are spending relatively low amounts of funds to acquire new accounts (spent 28 cents for every $1 of new annualized revenue in 2016). It appears that customers are mainly sticking with them, and as revenue growth continues shareholders should continue to reap the benefits of operating leverage as seen in increasing profits and margins. ShotSpotter is a Buy.Readers who have done their due diligence and are interested in the story should purchase a pilot position in the near term. I would wait for the upcoming quarterly report prior to adding significantly the stake (potentially taking advantage of any dips).One risk is the possibility of a slowdown in adoption and revenue growth, which would be devastating to the bullish thesis. If there is a trend of clients who do not renew their contracts going forward, that lack of ""stickiness"" would also be a nail in the bull thesis. Publicity (negative or positive) could play an outsized role in awareness of this technology and public perception, and the possibility of future partnerships (or failure to obtain them) is also a point to consider. A successful partnership leveraging Verizon's capabilities could result in plenty of upside in 2018, while hiccups along the way (or a parting of ways) would weigh on shares.For readers interested in stocks with near- to medium-term upside, I encourage you to take a look at the latest edition of ROTY (Runner of the Year) which includes our ROTY 10-stock model account and the ROTY Contenders List.Disclaimer: Commentary presented is not individualized investment advice.

4198877,104569,2018-08-14T08:43:48-04:00,ShotSpotter and Patriot One provide threat-detection solutions aimed at reducing overall violent crime.ShotSpotter utilizes a reactionary detection method while Patriot One's preventative system detects threats prior to a violent incident occuring.Patriot One's PATSCAN detection system can detect a wider variety of weapon than ShotSpotter and can be installed for a fraction of the price.,"With violent crime rates rising consistently over the past few years, public and municipal demand for systems that can detect threats and alert the proper channels has grown rapidly. This has created viable market opportunities for two of the leading threat-detection companies on the markets today, ShotSpotter (SSTI) and Patriot One Technologies (OTCQX:PTOTF). While both companies offer methods to improve response times and deter individuals from committing violent acts, Patriot One can detect a wider variety of weapons and threats at a lower cost than ShotSpotter, making it the ideal choice for the larger non-municipal markets, and the best investment for investors looking to get long-term exposure to the threat-detection industry.Source: ShotSpotter.comShotSpotter is a Bay Area threat-detection company that has grown from a small startup founded in 1996 to a $500MM public company whose share price has risen 240% since its IPO in June 2017. ShotSpotter's eponymous flagship product is a gunshot detection system that constantly scans for and reports gunfire to the proper authority channels. Law enforcement agencies who have installed ShotSpotter in their cities say that the technology has drastically reduced gunshot response times. Response times that could take up to 5 minutes have been reduced to times as low as 30 seconds. This efficiency is a result of phasing out traditional 911 calls by having the ShotSpotter system automatically record the location of the gunshots and relay that information to the proper law enforcement channels. The company's research has found that 80% of gunshots are never reported to 911, which heavily contributed to the high unsolved murder rate that the Washington Post reported to be over 50% in the past decade. Currently, ShotSpotter has over 12,000 sensors installed in 90 municipalities which collectively cover 550 square miles of public space. The ShotSpotter network recorded and reported over 99,000 instances of shooting activity in 2017 alone. To further improve their technology, ShotSpotter records and analyzes every gunshot their sensors detect in their database to improve the detection accuracy by giving it a data set for gunshot comparison to identify which specific firearm was discharged.Source: ShotSpotter Investor Presentation July 2018ShotSpotter also offers a specialized service for large indoor spaces where the installation team will produce a floor map that will be updated with an optimal path to the location of the shots when the system notifies law enforcement of an event. The indoor applications are currently cumbersome due to the additional labor efforts the facility mapping requires but ShotSpotter is actively working to improve both the accuracy and cost of indoor installations.Source: Owler.comPatriot One is an Ontario-based company that grew from a project team at McMaster University working to develop a preventative threat-detection system that could identify active shooter and terrorist threats before an attack occurred. The project group formed Patriot One after making significant progress on the use of microwave radar to detect unique weapon signatures and alert authorities of the potential threat prior to a violent event occurring. This led to the creation of PATSCAN technology, a specialized application of radar the company refers to as Cognitive Microwave Radar (CMR-1).Source: Patriot1Tech.comThe company IPO'd on Canadian markets under the name Patriot One Technologies in October 2017 and currently sits 25% higher than its IPO price at C$1.84 and a market cap of just under C$200MM. Patriot One has been hard at work preparing their PATSCAN threat-detection unit for a full public launch expected to occur within the next several quarters. While the product has not yet been released on a commercial level, Patriot One has been partnering with a multitude of security firms, resorts, schools, and government agencies to install early versions of their product which obtain valuable field data that is used to further improve and optimize the detection algorithms of their technology.See our previous article on threat-detection for a deeper look into the rapid growth of active shooter incidents in America.While both companies operate in the threat-detection industry, the range of applications is far greater for Patriot One than ShotSpotter. The majority of ShotSpotters revenues are generated from contracts with local government and law enforcement agencies. Patriot One PATSCAN units can be utilized by public and private institutions alike an assortment of environments without the need for specific modification. Between schools, offices, public spaces, event venues and government buildings, Patriot One can be effectively installed in a wider variety of locations then ShotSpotters network of gunshot detection sensors. Due to inability to easily install ShotSpotter in small private locations, we believe Patriot One's detection units will be available for a wider variety of consumers and will generate demand for PATSCAN technology outside of government and law enforcement agencies. ShotSpotter does control a highly-specialized market with law enforcement but we believe the limitations of operating in a smaller market where customers have severely constrained budgets gives Patriot One the larger potential market. This thesis is also strongly supported by the additional demand the ability to detect knives and bombs will generate for Patriot One as well. ShotSpotter can only detect firearm threats after the weapon has been discharged. Patriot One can detect firearms, knives, and explosive threats prior to an incident occurring. It can be reasonably inferred that when private customers are deciding between detecting only firearm threats vs. firearm, knife, and explosive threats, they will likely choose the system that encompasses a wider variety of possible threats.Patriot One Technologies FinancialsThe information provided below was pulled from the available MD&A discussions that Patriot One Technologies provides investors on SEDAR (the Canadian equivalent of EDGAR). Therefore, the following model for Patriot One Technologies is based in Canadian Dollars. As can be seen below we ran a burn rate analysis for Patriot One Technologies due to a lack of revenue at this stage in the company's development. As we have discussed in our previous article, the company is still pre-revenue but plans to begin filling back-orders for their system in the coming quarters. The burn rate analysis shows that among the three scenarios we have a range of 10-17 quarters of continued runway without revenue before a lack of funding becomes an issue for Patriot One Technologies. This is a substantial amount of time for the company to implement full production of the PATSCAN technology, providing our long investment thesis substantial weight.Patriot One Technologies Analyst RatingsMoreover, the single investment company that covers Patriot One Technologies recommends a buy with a price target of $2.50 CAD. Canaccord Genuity explained that ""This afternoon, Patriot One CEO Martin Cronin presented at in Boston. We continue to rate Patriot One shares SPECULATIVE BUY and believe that as the company successfully commercializes its unique cognitive microwave radar technology and broadens its threat detection platform, there is a significant potential upside for investors. There remain risks to the development timeline which informs our SPECULATIVE rating. However, the company continues to progress through developmental milestones and expects to begin recognizing revenue by the end of this calendar year. Our DCF value and target price for Patriot One remains unchanged at C$2.50.""ShotSpotter FinancialsShotSpotter recently reported their Q2 2018 earnings with revenues coming in at $89.3MM and EPS of ($0.03) beating overall analysts' expectations. Over the past fiscal year, ShotSpotter has grown their revenue by 53% and increased their Gross Margin from 41% to 56%. ShotSpotter has also reduced operating expenses from 83% of sales in Q4 2017 to 59% as of Q2 2018. Steady revenue growth with increasing margins and declining operating expenses are driving ShotSpotter closer to profitability with Q2 2018 net loss coming in at a fiscal year low of ($369K). Sales & Marketing have overtaken General & Administrative as the largest expense category, indicating positive progress to investors as gears shift heavily to focus on increasing brand exposure and approaching municipalities about subscribing to the ShotSpotter service.ShotSpotter Analyst RatingsBelow the analyst recommendations for ShotSpotter can be seen. Immediately, one notices that the analyst recommendations are all for outperforms and buys which is usually a positive indicator. The issue we find with the recommendations is that three of the four analyst price targets have already been passed by ShotSpotter which is currently trading at 43.13 at the time of the article. We believe this is a sign of over-extension of the share price of ShotSpotter and should induce skepticism about their continued ability to further increase their share price. Especially considering they are yet to post a positive earnings period.One of the largest concerns with installing ShotSpotter sensors is the high annual subscription cost to keep the sensors connected to the ShotSpotter network. Municipalities are being charged between $35,000-$65,000 per square mile of coverage they want. ShotSpotter also has a 3 square mile minimum that must be met to have the system installed. With how tight city and law enforcement budgets already are, many municipalities are unable to afford the yearly costs and have been inadvertently isolated from ShotSpotters target market. While there are numerous cities with large enough budgets and gun-crime rates to justify the annual costs, several ShotSpotter pilot cities, such as Charlotte, NC, and Fall River, CA, have been dropping out of the service, opting to use the saved money on additional officers and surveillance devices. Most municipalities are spending over $200,000 on ShotSpotter as cities typically have multiple areas with high gun-violence that exist more than 1 square mile from each other.Patriot One's PATSCAN units sell to retailers for $10,000 apiece with an additional $500 per year to keep the unit connected to their network. Patriot One's units are installed in specific locations with high foot-traffic This enables municipalities to place individual units in high-risk environments rather than needing to unnecessarily cover additional lower-risk areas which is the main issue with ShotSpotter's 3 square mile coverage minimum. Both city officials and private institutions will likely prefer PATSCAN because of the drastically decreased cost-barrier compared to ShotSpotter. While large cities may have the capital allocated in the budget to subscribe to ShotSpotter's coverage, individual institutions such as retailers and schools do not. While ShotSpotter does offer a coverage package for buildings that will generate a floor map and the optimal path to the location of the shots, it comes at the same cost at the general system intended to cover miles of city environments. This makes Patriot One the more appealing choice for individual institutions for a variety of reasons. They are able to control their costs as they can purchase one or two individual units for $10,000-$20,000 to install at choke points rather than spending up to $60,000 to achieve the same level of coverage. Installing PATSCAN technology also drastically decreases future related expenses as one PATSCAN unit would only require $500 per year or 5% of the initial purchase price to maintain while ShotSpotter requires 100% of the initial price in subscription fees each year.Source: ShotSpotter.comShotSpotter detects gunfire through a network of audio sensors that are triggered by the unique frequency of gunshots. This prevents the system from triggering on traffic or other loud noises but has led to a series of false reports around New Year's Eve and the Fourth of July from fireworks. When ShotSpotter sensors pick up gunfire, they quickly communicate with each other to triangulate a location and then relay that location and information about the type of gun used to law enforcement. ShotSpotter also has an application smartphone users can download to be alerted when a gun is fired in the area. The technology has a high success rate and catches well over 50% of gunshots, but cities have had issues with the system not catching all shots fired within the coverage area. This has led to cities removing themselves from the program as they cannot justify the cost of the technology if they cannot be guaranteed 100% coverage.Source: Patriot1Tech.comPatriot One takes a different approach to detecting violent threats. They utilize a proprietary detection system that identifies unique weapon signatures by sending our CMR-1 signals that are then analyzed by a series of search algorithms that try and fit the signal to a weapon profile. This allows threats to be identified before they use their weapon and before they have a chance to leave the area. PATSCAN's CMR-1 technology also ensures the privacy of general citizens it may scan. It does not capture any images or video, does not record sound, and does not even try and identify each body it sees. The system is only searching for specific profiles known to be weapons, and will only begin finding information on the individual after it has confirmed a weapon to be on their person. Personal privacy is also an issue ShotSpotter is currently dealing with because while their sensors do not try and monitor conversations, they must be listening constantly to be able to take in gunfire sounds. Patriot One's alternative can accomplish even more by providing a proactive alert rather than a reactive one without needing to record any type of information that could compromise citizen's privacy rights if it fell into the wrong hands.Both companies offer a product that can and will continue to save lives as they are continually implemented around the country and world. Although this is true, we recognize that the capacity for saving lives and securing places is much better addressed by Patriot One Technologies as compared to ShotSpotter. Both offer the ability to be used indoors and outdoors, but their installation process and utility vary greatly. As can be seen above ShotSpotter focuses on the reactive measures after a firearm has been discharged in the radius of their acoustic gunshot identification system. These systems operate in very large areas, comprising of a square mile of coverage per installation unit. In comparison, Patriot One Technologies provides a range of two meters for their system which provides transparency to security professionals, guards and law enforcement of concealed weapons moving through access points and other high traffic areas. This technology while limited by survey area compared to ShotSpotter can be used in choke/access points of buildings to identify any weapons entering or exiting an area. This allows for early detection of weapons in any secured area and the deterrence of an event through preemptive response by security or law enforcement. The differences between these two systems objectives highlight the main difference between the two companies. Patriot One provides users with a preemptive identification of possible threats while ShotSpotter is entirely reactive. For use in protecting the public, we believe both are necessary, but the offerings of Patriot One seem much more attractive and necessary to begin to curb the active shooter and gun violence issues that plague the United States.Moreover, Patriot One Technologies offers in our opinion a more comprehensive system, which includes the use of AI for optimization of the units as well as plans to develop Facial Recognition software to compliment their threat identification software. Patriot One's use of AI strongly enhances their offerings to consumers. As each individual unit experiences a new environment, it will optimize itself to best scan their environment which allows for its use in a multitude of unconventional spaces. Furthermore, the AI system continuously updates a database with new and pertinent information about weapons that it has identified. This shared database accessible by each unit allows for constant improvement in the systems threat detection abilities. In ShotSpotters case they utilize a human managed database of sounds which are used to identify different firearms audio resonations. This presents a disadvantage for their system as the database needs continued manual updating to function properly.Finally, Patriot One Technologies a more internationally friendly product. In many other countries around the world, guns are either illegal or are under such intense regulation that they are much less of a threat compared to other weapons such as knives, In this capacity, the applications of the Patriot One system are much more comprehensive for integration into the international security market than ShotSpotters system which revolves around firearm usage.Both of these firms have thrown their full weight into attempting to reduce gun violence and active shooter events. Comparatively, they have unique approaches for how their systems aid communities in either preventing or responding to these tragic events. The detection triggers, costs, and market applications of ShotSpotter and Patriot One were the largest differentiators in our analysis of the two company's product offerings. Patriot One is preventative while ShotSpotter is reactionary. Given the overall goal of threat-detection as a means to lower violent crime rates, we believe that a preventive system will be the more attractive monitoring system among consumers. The attractiveness of Patriot One is further exemplified by the range of applications that the prevention system provides over a reactionary one. Whether the customer is a small local business, a large concert venue, or university, the utilization of the Patriot One system can help to keep their consumer and their clients safe and alert them of possible threats before an act of violence occur. This additional level of security also comes at a much lower cost than ShotSpotter with even lower annual costs to maintain. Because of the preventative detection methods, low costs, and a wide array of market applications, we believe that investors looking to gain exposure to the threat-detection industry will realize greater long-term returns with Patriot One Technologies than they will with an investment in ShotSpotter.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4130674,24589,2017-12-20T10:00:00-05:00,"Despite recent doom and gloom talk that came as a result of the pullback in fall, it has still been a decent year.The FDA is taking steps to speed up not only drug approvals but also generic approvals.Personally, after being in touch with some very intelligent investors and analysts from China, I am convinced the country has an emerging biotech sector that will continue to gain prominence and be taken more seriously going forward.","An 11-year Seeking Alpha member, author Jonathan Faison focuses on discovering under-the-radar stocks and alpha-generating ideas for his readers. Operating primarily in the biotech sector, his specialty is looking specifically for opportunities to achieve high percentage gains within a year's time frame. These opportunities constitute the core focus of his popular ROTY (Runner of the Year) series. Last but not least, he highlights risk management and entry/exit strategies quite a bit, as he feels they represent areas that are often neglected but materially important for readers to understand and apply.Seeking Alpha Editor Steve Brown touched base with him recently to gain some insights on what investors can expect in the new year ahead. Here's what he had to say:Steve Brown (SB): What are your thoughts on performance for the biotech sector in 2017, factors that could impact it next year, and implications for readers here on Seeking Alpha?Jonathan Faison (JF): As I write this, IBB (the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF) has gone from significantly outperforming major indices year-to-date to finishing at similar levels.Despite recent doom and gloom talk that came as a result of the pullback in fall, it has still been a decent year. On the other hand, looking at the three-year chart, the sector has clearly fallen behind and has a ways to go to turn things around.While performance has been flat over that time frame, many individual small- and mid-cap stocks have done very well. Strong science and solid management will be rewarded in good times and bad, although it can be much more difficult to stay in a stock during rough patches. Companies successfully crossing the finishing line and launching innovative treatments have done and continue to do well (i.e. Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRPT), Neurocrine Biosciences (NASDAQ:NBIX), Adamas Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ADMS), etc.).Several contributors on Seeking Alpha have been nailing under-the-radar small-cap picks and generating alpha for their readers. Some that come to mind include JÃ©rÃ´me Verony's choice of Marinus Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:MRNS) in May, Bret Jensen's call on Ignyta (NASDAQ:RXDX), Dr. Tran's piece on Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:SPPI) and the list goes on (and on). My opinion is that readers would do well to tune out the noise from talking heads, focus on their own due diligence and perhaps follow a select few writers who have proven themselves over time.While I don't consider myself a ""macro-guy"", I do note that several factors should impact 2018 going forward. The FDA is taking steps to speed up not only drug approvals but also generic approvals. If biotech companies can bring more innovative treatments to market in a timelier manner, investors and patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries. I consider Trump to be somewhat of a wild card, but if tax reforms come through, it's no secret that all eyes will be on M&A activity in the sector. If a wave of promising companies is scooped up, it could be a buy signal for Wall Street and stoke money flows back into the sector.As usual there are several risk factors going forward for those who gain exposure to this sector. These include the continued drug pricing debate and associated fallout, damaging headlines (i.e. Allergan's (NYSE:AGN) wacky efforts to protect Restasis patents) and continued selling pressure limiting the profit potential of run-up plays or muting price action.SB: Is there a specific area of the biotech sector that you are currently drawn to?JF: Personally, after being in touch with some very intelligent investors and analysts from China, I am convinced the country has an emerging biotech sector that will continue to gain prominence and be taken more seriously going forward. Such ideas as Hutchison China Meditech (NASDAQ:HCM) and BeiGene (NASDAQ:BGNE) have already worked out very well for us, and I look forward to searching for more in 2018. I used to be very wary of the Israeli biotech sector, but there are definitely diamonds there such as Neuroderm (NASDAQ:NDRM). A few European-based biotech companies have caught my eye going forward as well, including Netherlands-based Argenx (NASDAQ:ARGX) and Belgium-based Ablynx (ABLX, OTCPK:ABLYF, OTC:ABYLY). Galapagos (GLPG, OTC:GLPGF, OTCPK:GLPYY) has been a long time favorite as well.Two other areas that have caught investor attention include cannabis biotechs and those trying to find the correct assets to combine with PD-1 inhibitors. The latter is an incredibly crowded field with many firms claiming to have drug candidates that could enhance the activity of these treatments, which in turn makes it difficult to determine which companies best stand to benefit. Nektar (NASDAQ:NKTR) has been a big winner and Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) looks primed for a rebound in 2018, but overall I've had my share of losing picks in this crowded arena in 2017. As for cannabinoid candidates, GW Pharmaceuticals' (GWPH, OTCPK:GWPRF) Epidiolex could be crossing the finish line soon and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ZYNE) could have two pivotal programs underway in 2018 utilizing its synthetic transdermal cannabinoid treatments.SB: How is the ROTY model account currently positioned for 2018?JF: First, I want to remind readers that we remain nimble in ROTY, constantly weighing the merits of each position and reacting to material developments. We try to stay patient with our stocks and give the thesis time to play out as long as they are acting as expected - however, when one heads south on us or I'm not a fan of new developments we move on to another idea from the Contenders List.Currently, we continue to hold three of our ASH plays (Global Blood Therapeutics, GlycoMimetics and Argenx) with mixed results. The first of these surprised me with high volume selling after patient deaths (compassionate access) were reported, but if the stock can stabilize the plan is to hold at least a partial position through HOPE Part A data and possibly beyond. The latter two appear quite attractive over multiple time frames.GW Pharmaceuticals and Amicus Therapeutics both have a unique mix of regulatory catalysts and data readouts coming next year, so I imagine we will continue to build up those positions.Two potential near term runners that are on the speculative side are Galmed Pharmaceuticals and Tracon Pharmaceuticals. The first of these is an under the radar NASH play with two important readouts in the next couple quarters, while the latter sports an incredibly cheap valuation with key readouts coming in renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular cancer.As for more recently added ideas, Clementia Pharmaceuticals had its IPO in August and offers us exposure to the rare disease space with preliminary data from a mid-stage study (Part B open-label extension portion) in FOP expected in the second quarter. Mirati Therapeutics is a promising targeted oncology play that reminds me of prior winners in the space, Loxo Oncology and Ignyta. Lastly, MyoKardia appears to be an interesting Â¨buy the dipÂ¨ idea with a unique approach to treating heritable cardiomyopathies and prior encouraging data for lead candidate mavacamten in symptomatic, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.As always, readers should stay tuned to future editions of ROTY as we cut our losers and initiate positions in Contenders that are setting up technically and fundamentally.SB: Which mistakes did you learn the most from this year?JF: The short answer is quite a few, but after almost 10 years of trading tech and biotech stocks, one constant for me is continually trying to improve, making notes of losing trades - where I went wrong and measures to take going forward.An obvious one was not being patient enough with my winners. As an example, our plan for AnaptysBio (NASDAQ:ANAB) in ROTY was to play the run-up and hold a partial position into data based on a deeper dive I did into the mechanism of action for ANB020. However, after realizing a solid profit I took risk completely off the table and subsequently the stock doubled on positive results in atopic dermatitis. There were several others such as Sarepta and ShotSpotter (NASDAQ:SSTI) that I cut too soon.I try to stay nimble, patient with winners but cutting losers if they are not performing as expected. There were several instances for ROTY where we took bigger hits because I held on too long to underperformers, so that is an area to improve going forward next year.The types of stocks I typically look for offer asymmetric risk/reward with catalysts in the near to medium term. Whether an earnings growth story, product launch or progressing pipeline with key readouts coming, I want to be in situations where I feel that readers and I have a higher probability of realizing decent upside with downside capped due to the value of existing assets or the core business. In situations where we have a single product company with perhaps greater downside potential, we try to mitigate risk via playing run-ups and either selling out prior to material events or holding partial positions (25% to 75% of original position) depending on how high our conviction is that prior data indicates a higher probability of success.One underexploited area of the biotech arena is stocks in the under $5 range, as there are companies with promising treatments that have been left for dead or are currently off Wall Street's radar. However, for every gem there are many losers and it is important to be highly selective. Going forward that is definitely another area for me to improve in.SB: What is the chief message you want to get across to your readers in the midst of volatility in the biotech sector?JF: It is important to find a strategy that works for you and stick to it. Too many people float from one strategy to the next hoping to find the holy grail, losing badly on one stock only to be frenetically searching for another idea to make it back to even. The contributors and readers whose opinions I respect the most have defined the type of situations they look for and how to exploit them. Whether being primarily an options trader or buy-and-hold investor with a longer time frame, they profit time and again by sticking to their rules and leaving their emotions at the door.Going forward, regardless of language coming from Washington or whatever headwinds we face in 2018, the kinds of stocks we look for in ROTY (asymmetric risk/reward with material catalysts) will offer opportunities to profit. The strategy does not change during bear markets or corrections per se - what does change is that in bad times we tend to hold more cash and be more selective on our positions and entry points.SB: What are the main benefits you have received from writing on this platform?JF: Without a doubt two of the highlights for me would be the community here on Seeking Alpha and the contacts I've made as a result of my writing. If the format and performance of ROTY is successful, it is largely in part due to assistance from readers in constantly finding ways to improve it and make it accessible. I write fairly frequently due to the amount of ideas coming up in my daily scans, and readers are gracious to provide additional facts from their own due diligence and correct my occasional errors. I've gotten to know some really great people, celebrate some key wins together and they also hold me accountable for my losers. While we keep the conversation 90% focused on generating new ideas and making a profit, I've enjoyed occasional discussion of off-topic themes as well.As for the first point, it is no secret that I write about stocks primarily from a trader's standpoint and do not possess a medical background. I've been fortunate enough to get to know a few institutional investors, analysts and other biotech guys whose wealth of knowledge I really respect. It's been very helpful to be able to reach out to them from time to time when I need a second opinion about a specific aspect of an investment or a potential red flag I don't understand. Additionally, when I occasionally wanted to reach out to management teams to better understand their companies' story writing on this platform has made gaining access much easier.SB: Which writers do you believe are contributing high-quality pieces and are currently ""under the radar""?JF: The guys at AMP Biotech Research are incredibly knowledgeable given their extensive backgrounds in the biotech space. C. C. Abbott is a relatively new contributor that nailed Protalix (NYSEMKT:PLX) and offers a great deal of insight and delves into the intricacies of clinical studies focusing on the science behind each company. Zach Hartman's 3 Things in Biotech series has become a staple on Seeking Alpha and is an enjoyable, worthwhile daily read. If the past is any clue, I expect the quality of analysis provided by many experienced contributors here to continue to draw both retail and institutional investors to the website due to insights provided and returns generated for readers.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4358924,105308,2020-07-16T16:53:03-04:00,"ShotSpotter's revenue growth has significantly slowed down. Unlike analyst expectations, guidance points towards no re-acceleration.Even under optimistic assumptions, ShotSpotter fails to deliver exciting medium-term returns that justify its risks.Shares are overvalued and are subject to significant downside potential.There is little to no upside in buying ShotSpotter for the medium term.","ShotSpotter (NASDAQ:SSTI) came to my attention during the stock's rally in 2017-2018. The product seemed compelling, and frankly, it still works well. Management claims that there has been meaningful shooting reduction because of ShotSpotter, with areas like Oakland seeing a significant shooting decrease of 66%, per mile. With the potential to increase people's quality of living, and even save lives, ShotSpotter's product may have merit for citizens, but the same cannot be said for the stock.Despite shares trading almost 40% lower than last year, we believe that there is a significant downside ahead, which could result in shares losing value further.Source: BusinessInsiderIn this article, we will:When I initially discovered the stock, I was indeed excited in terms of its potential growth. As I mentioned, the product has clear merit. I could easily see it installed in most major cities, assisting local police departments who deal with shootings regularly. From 2016 to 2018, revenues grew from $15.5M to $34.8M, achieving a ~124% expansion. I can assure I was as excited as the rest of SSTI's shareholders at the time, and I initiated a position in the company, around the $30s.However, the growth trajectory has significantly slowed since then, with revenues barely growing over the past 18 months. In fact, the company saw a reduction in some QoQ revenues, as the graph illustrates below. Being partially a SaaS company with nearly 100% of its revenues in the form of a subscription, my excitement had quickly evaporated. As a result, I sold my shares around last summer, booking a small loss, and calling it a day.Source: PresentationHowever, credit where credit's due, the company has been making operational progress. Gross margins have consistently been improving, nearly reaching 60% as of last quarter.As a result, analysts have been estimating a considerable jump in future EPS generation. As you can see, despite approximations being continually reduced, consensus estimates project FY2022 EPS of $0.74.These EPS figures are projected alongside with FY2021 and FY2022 revenue estimates, at $51M and $64M, respectively. However, this makes little sense. Not only revenues have significantly slowed down over the past two years, but the company itself has published guidance of $43M and $46M (reduced from $46M to $48M) for FY2020. Assuming the midpoint is realized, around $44.5M, YoY revenue will only be 9%. Meanwhile, according to consensus estimates, sales growth will somehow accelerate to approximately 16% and 26% over the next two years. There is clearly a mismatch in expectations, especially considering the company reducing its guidance, which, if anything, should reduce estimates.Still, let us show that, even with such optimistic assumptions, shares offer little potential returns moving forward.Below, we have illustrated the consensus estimates, followed by a 10% annual increase from 2022 to 2025. We believe this is still very optimistic, as we assume EPS will be growing at a faster rate than current revenues.Source: Analyst estimates, AuthorBased on ShotSpotter's current share price, EPS projections, and different potential valuation multiples in the medium term (2025), we get the following CAGR return scenarios.As you can see, even if shares will be trading at a decent P/E ratio of around 30, investors should expect CAGR returns that hardly surprises 5%. For returns to turn out somehow meaningful, shares must attract a valuation multiple of at least 40X earnings.Source: AuthorIn the meantime, the risk is great, since there are not tangible facts to base such a projected revenue and EPS acceleration in the first place. Investors can get nearly as good returns in many other established, consistently growing profitable companies in the market. To take such a risk of buying a company with relatively stagnated revenue growth, investors are clearly buying hope and not financials. Projected returns should be a lot higher, for a small-cap like ShotSpotter, with significant operational risks.As a result, we don't see how shares could be viewed as attractive, at their current price of $23.3.With such high expectations and little upside potential, it should clearly be indicated that shares must be overvalued. Let's examine:The company has a high beta of 1.6, which makes for a relatively high cost of equity, at around 9.66%. Since there is 0 debt on the balance sheet, WACC is basically just the cost of equity. We initiate calculations with a free cash flow generation amount of $4.3M, as the company has reported over the past 12 months.Source: AuthorWe are still going to assume an incredible optimistic jump in free cash flow generation of 100% and 40% each in the first two years, to share the same enthusiasm as the market. The figures look as follows:Source: AuthorPlugging all the needed numbers, and discounting cash flows, we come out with a potential downside of around 16.8%. That is, assuming the company achieves such high free cash flow generation growth rates.Source: AuthorIn the meantime, in the last earnings report, the company mentioned that revenue growth was offset by ""delays in both deploying contracted miles and renewals with certain customers."" Should, for budgeting and cost-cutting reasons, the company fail to renew its contracts, lowering potential profits and, in turn, free cash flow, shares could end up delivering a much higher downside.For perspective, suppose we reduce our previous estimates of free cash flow growth into the following ones:Source: AuthorOur results, all else constant, would then indicate as much as a 50% downside from the stock's current price. Source: AuthorWe have avoided predicting what the intrinsic value/share would be in a scenario where free cash flow actually goes down, as the results would definitely not be pretty. Such a scenario is not out of the question, in the case of police departments having their budgets cut. There have also been lots of discussions lately regarding defunding the police, following George Floyd's incident, as well. The future budget of police departments is not certain at these times.ShotSpotter had an impressive early run, indicating a promising potential for future growth. However, over the past 18 months, revenue growth has significantly slowed down. Even with consensus estimates for growth and EPS acceleration, shares offer limited upside, considering the risks involved. The company's guidance points towards limited growth as well, further highlighting the possibility of stagnated sales. Further, shares are overvalued based on future free cash flow generation, even after estimating quite optimistic results. As a result, we feel that ShotSpotter could create little to no shareholder value moving forward and will avoid buying into it again, all points considered."
4129536,26671,2017-12-04T14:24:06-05:00,"A hit piece issued by a mostly unknown short shop called MOXReports on November 21, 2017, sent the shares of ShotSpotter from $15.08 to $13.20 currently.This article refutes that poorly researched report point by point.This article also explains why the lockup expiration on December 4th is unlikely to be a significant concern.The stock decline on no news other than the short article creates a new buying opportunity.An earnings update and other major updates from my prior article is also discussed.","Bill Bratton, former NYPD Police Commissioner and new ShotSpotter DirectorBackgroundShotSpotter, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSTI) creates systems that detect gunshots. It can pinpoint the exact location of the gunshot and type of weapon used. The company does this by placing noise sensors throughout the area served. It takes three or more sensors to pinpoint the location. A report of the time and location of the gunshots is immediately analyzed by the company and sent to the local police usually within a minute. It currently serves over 90 cities in the U.S., primarily in higher crime areas. ShotSpotter has no existing competition and none who have announced they plan to enter the market. I see ShotSpotter as similar to an alarm company (such as ADT or alarm.com). Like them they have mostly recurring revenues from long term contracts and the service provided is alerting the police to trouble. This makes ShotSpotterâs revenues quite predictable if you know the new business coming on. ShotSpotterâs sensors are increasingly tied to cameras provided by other vendors. This makes the system stickier.This article is a follow-up to my prior article dated September 29, 2017, found here. For much more on ShotSpotter, including background, catalysts, barriers to entry, competitive advantages, a valuation, and concerns please read the original article first before proceeding.This article focuses on the MOXReports hit piece, impending lock up expirations, an update on financial results and a potential new catalyst.Recent Short AttacksI donât mind short position articles as I myself occasionally take a short position and have written a few myself on Seeking Alpha. Recently two such articles were written about ShotSpotter. I previously wrote a favorable piece on ShotSpotter on September 19 th. The stock subsequently had a strong run up over 50% and I took my profits. It then fell back to where it was when I wrote the article on no news other than the two articles. I have re-entered my position as my evaluation of the two articles is they have little merit. The primary article was written by MOXReports. I will focus mostly on that one below.A second one by Don Dion in Seeking Alpha focused solely on the coming IPO lockup expiration. Mr. Dionâs only point is the stock had run up considerably and many restricted shareholders would take their profits. This point is mostly no longer valid due to the subsequent drop in the stock price.MOXReports ArticleMOXReports is a short shop run by Richard Pearson. It has published reports on over 40 companies over the past five years. Despite this, it is relatively unknown. Itâs website (moxreports.com) has almost no traffic according to Semrush. On November 21, 2017, it issued a hit piece on ShotSpotter, Inc. MOXReports had eight claims, each of which are discussed and refuted below. Their claims are in parentheses followed by my response.1. âUninterrupted history of failure. After a 23 year history of uninterrupted commercial and financial failure, ShotSpotter was suddenly publicly hyped in 2017 as an innovative high tech solution to gun violence, so that it could come public in an IPO by Roth Capital. For two decades ShotSpotter has had repeated brushes with outright insolvency.âThis point is irrelevant. Like many of technology and biotech companies, ShotSpotter had many years of losses and improving its technology before taking off. Things really started moving when the current management arrived. CEO Ralph Clarke was hired in 2010 and initiated the game changing command center in 2011. Most of his management team arrived afterward. CFO Alan Stewart came on board in February, 2017. The past has no bearing on the current explosive growth with no competition by the company, other than given ShotSpotter lots of tax loss carry forwards to use in the future.2. âThe IPO was arranged as the only exit for insiders from a business that has been unable to succeed for more than 20 years. The purpose of this IPO was simply to allow insiders and PE investors to exit an otherwise unsellable, money losing investment. On December 4th, 8 million shares will be released from lockup, allowing these investors to finally sell. Ahead of that lockup expiration, ShotSpotter juiced its revenues by pulling forward nearly $1 million of revenues from a cancelled Puerto Rico contract and then failing to disclose other contract cancellations.âFirst of all, there are not 8 million shares under lockup, it is 6.3 million, which is the total shares held prior to the IPO. Secondly, no insiders or other existing shareholders sold shares in the IPO. In fact they were buyers.The insider and large institutional holders prior to the IPO are shown in the chart below.Source: ShotSpotter Form S-1The two largest insiders were Director Gary Lauder and CEO Ralph Clark. Both were actually buyers at the IPO. Their buying level is unusual for an IPO. CEO Clarke bought 13,636 shares and Director Lauder bought 91,000 shares. Additionally, CFO Stewart bought 9,090 shares. Messrs. Clarke and Lauder make up close to half of all the locked up shares. The current stock price is similar to that at the IPO which does not make sellers taking gains. Director Lauder is the largest shareholder by far. He has been an investor for over 15 years. It is unlikely he will start dumping shares now that things are finally taking off after 15 years of waiting. This is especially so since he was recently a buyer. Director Lauder is part of the Estee Lauder family and is very well off so he doesnât need to sell. On November 20th, 2017, CEO Clark exercised 10,000 options and kept all the shares. This indicates he is more likely to buy than sell.CEO Clark and Director Lauder are close to half the locked up shares. If they hold, there will be moderate pressure at most on the stock after December 4 th.3. âShotSpotter. Does. Not. Work. Period. Reams of hard data prove quite conclusively that ShotSpotter simply does not work. This is why ShotSpotter has repeatedly been unable to maintain customers or generate any profits despite 20 years of trying. Actual documented success rates of less than 2%, with 70-80% of all alerts being unfounded or false alarms.âFirstly, MOXReports evidence is anecdotal and mostly predates ShotSpotters move to its command center model. This move to a command center is very important and totally ignored by MOXReports. This happened for all new customers in 2011. Existing customers were subsequently moved there with the last just this year. Previously, ShotSpotter sold its systems to police departments and the police monitored the system to analyze the sounds recorded. Several years ago, ShotSpotter switched to a command center model, where it monitors all sounds and reports them to the police, usually within a minute. This has led to much less work and expense for the police and much better trained sound analysts. Complaints about ShotSpotter have significantly declined since then and business has boomed.Secondly, every police department does significant due diligence prior to buying ShotSpotterâs system. Investigations is what police departments specialize in (duh?). The decision is often political and involves a lot of eyes watching the process. After the contract is signed, the system is then tested with numerous firearms, often supplied by the police.MOXReports pointed to several articles that questioned ShotSpotter. I have included links below to many more, mostly more recent ones, by major media outlets that support ShotSpotterâs technology.Miami Herald 9/29/17 ( this article directly refutes MOXReports claim that Miami is out)Washington Post 4/23/16 and 5/10/17DNAInfo 2/1/17WCPO News Cincinnati  8/19/17CBS Chicago 10/26/17Wall Street Journal 8/3/17NYPD News 6/7/17Denver Channel 9 9/21/16NBC San Diego 11/30/17Sacramento Bee 8/6/17CBS Sacramento 9/19/174. âCustomers explicitly state that ShotSpotter does not work and fully confirm the hard data. New customers keep canceling. Following their cancellations, former customers confirm categorically that ShotSpotter simply does not work. Including major âtrophyâ contracts such as Baltimore, Miami, San Antonio and Oakland.âMOXReports supports this statement by listing seven cities that cancelled the service based on inadequate results over the past five years. Those cities were Miami, Baltimore, Charlotte, Oakland, San Antonio, Fall River (MA), and Troy (NY). First of all, Oakland and Fall River have not cancelled their service. Miami is actually expanding. San Antonio appears to be leaving but hasnât yet.Secondly, MOXReports statement is entirely one sided. ShotSpotter has in fact grown significantly over the past five years and recently announced seven new cities just in the second quarter of 2017. Turnover, or churn, is a part of every business. MOXReports statement is one sided and ignores that much more business has been gained than lost. ShotSpotterâs churn is relatively low. The retention rate was 112% in 2015 and 127% in 2016. This means existing customers are adding significantly more mileage than they are cancelling. The company would not have given a 41% increase in revenue guidance for revenue in 2018 if they were concerned with retention.5. âShotSpotter employee testimony (under oath) states that data presented to law enforcement is outright fabricated.âShotSpotterâs 80% guaranty is not a marketing thing. It is a warranty by the company that could lead to contract adjustments or additional equipment costs if not met. Due to advances in research and development, the company has recently increased that warranty to 90%. All systems are tested at installation by numerous firearms.The âcourt challengesâ referred to are challenges to evidence in criminal courts by defense teams. They are routine by defense teams in a criminal case. Neither I nor MOXReports could find any evidence that any evidence provided by ShotSpotter has ever been disregarded by a court of law.6. âAggressive tactics to conceal, distort or prevent outright the release of the âdamningâ data. Internal memos reveal aggressive tactics by ShotSpotter to thwart FOIA requests by journalists and universities seeking transparency into government spending on ShotSpotter. Deliberate steps to legally gag police forces from disclosing the negative data. The data being withheld is the same data that categorically proves that ShotSpotter simply does not work.âWhat ShotSpotter is doing is standard in most businesses. They are telling their clients that information collected for their clients belongs to ShotSpotter and the client and no one else. There are many reasons ShotSpotter may be doing this. First of all, while its not part of their business model, its possible they may be able to charge for data pools in the future. They could also do it for competitive reasons and to avoid false attacks like MOXReports.7. âShotSpotter fails to disclose major contract losses ahead of lockup expiration. In its November earnings call, ShotSpotter indicated clearly that only one contract had been lost. Below I show the proof that 3 more contracts have been lost but not disclosed by ShotSpotter ahead of the lockup expiration.âMOXReports pointed to three contracts; San Antonio, Fall River (MA), and Oakland. Oakland is not a loss. It is a situation where Oakland has decided not to go forward with an expansion. The other two may simply be timing, in that the contract did not end in the quarter. In the Fall River situation, there is a mayoral race and the challenger has stated he wants to expand ShotSpotter. ShotSpotterâs system is not cheap. At any given time, a police department may make a financial decision not to continue with it.8. âShotSpotter makes diametrically opposing statements to law enforcement, journalists and university researchers, depending on its financial interest in each situation. ShotSpotter presents one set of facts to law enforcement when selling its product to government payers. It then presents the opposite âfactsâ to parties trying to investigate spending on ShotSpotter and its effectiveness. ShotSpotter also presents additional âfactsâ which contradict its own data when marketing the product. The government payers who buy ShotSpotter are relying on the wrong data.âThe âGovernment payersâ in this case are police departments. Police departments are a strongly bound fraternal group that talk to each other. Police departments do extensive due diligence and test new technologies like ShotSpotter. Investigations is what they do for a living. It is easy to test, just fire off a few rounds in the range of ShotSpotterâs sensors. But it is hard to game 90 customers who do investigations for a living.Earnings UpdateShotSpotter announced earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017 on November 7, 2017. Revenues totaled $6.85 million up 72% from $3.98 million one year earlier, and 17% from one quarter earlier. The company raised revenue guidance for 2017 from $21.5 to $22.5 million $23.0 million. It also introduced revenue guidance of $30.0 to $32.0 million for 2018. At the midpoint, that is a 41% increase in revenues in 2018, after a guidance raise in 2017. That percentage is above the 2016 increase but below the 2017 increase. Operating results over the past three years is shown below.Source: Author's calculations from ShotSpotter SEC forms 10Q and 10K.Note that ShotSpotter no longer has any interest bearing debt so interest expense is now zero. The biggest change from the second quarter to the third besides the big increase in revenues is a large increase in sales and marketing from the second quarter. The company is putting the pedal to the metal to drive future revenue growth. It is important to note that cost of sales and R&D are not growing much despite the huge increase in sales. This means a large portion of future revenue increases will fall right to the bottom line, especially since the company has a huge amount of tax-loss carry forwards. The command center can handle a lot more work with little new investment. R&D is to make the current system better, faster and cheaper. Advances in the warranty rate to 90% show the progress being made. Improvements in earnings and EBITDA due to lower COGS and R&D expense percentages have been happening over the past three years.Adjusted EBITDA (excluding an impairment and debt prepayment cost) totaled $552,000 in the third quarter of 2017.Other Significant UpdatesOn November 15, 2017, the company announced that Bill Bratton has been elected a director of the company. This is huge for ShotSpotter, as Mr. Bratton is arguably the best-known active police executive in the country. He has served two terms as the Police Commissioner of the NYPD, stepping down the second time last year. He also served as the Police Commissioner of the LAPD from 2002-2009 and the Boston Police Department from 1993-1994. If there was any question as to the credibility of ShotSpotterâs system it was removed by this election.On December 1, 2017, it was announced ShotSpotter has been added to the MSCI U.S. Micro Cap Index. This index had 991 companies in it as of October 31, 2017. While not a major index, it is an important step for ShotSpotter which had only 31% of its stock held by institutions as of September 30, 2017, due to its recent IPO. As more indexes and institutions start buying it will put upward pressure on the stock.ShotSpotter is now covered by three analysts, each of whom have a buy rating.ValuationIn my last article on ShotSpotter published September 29, 2017, I had a one year price target of $18.50 and the current price was $12.90. ShotSpotter stock actually surpassed my target after my article, reaching a high of $20.15. It then took a round trip back to the current $13.20 due to the MOXreports article and the pending lockups expiration. Neither are a major concern in my opinion due to the reasons previously given. There is a chance there will be some locked up shares selling but that impact will be temporary.The stock currently trades at about 6X revenues and 4X next years guided revenues. This is not high for a growth stock growing revenues at over 40%. Those stocks routinely get 10X+ revenues, especially when there is no competition. Pressure to adopt ShotSpotterâs system has only increased lately with recent mass shootings. Additionally, cash on the balance sheet currently represents 15% of the market cap and there is no interest bearing debt.Since my last article there was a strong revenue advance last quarter and the guidance for 41% revenue growth next year. I had modeled for only a 20% revenue advance next year. Based on these two factors, my new price target is raised from $18.50 to $20.00."
4102164,24589,2017-08-27T16:10:58-04:00,"I first introduced readers to the Shotspotter story on July 10th.The company's first reported quarter as a publicly traded firm revealed a business poised for significant growth and ultimately the ROTY model account initiated (again) an initial pilot position.Today's highlighted news from the Secret Service goes a long way toward adding credibility to the story and should not be understated.My recent ROTY piece was written prior to catching wind of this news as I grew increasingly optimistic on the bullish thesis. However, while I welcome today's news I still want to issue a word of caution to readers.Risks to thesis include clients opting not to renew contracts due to expenses outweighing benefits, slowing adoption, controversy regarding need for the technology and volatility associated with the low float.","A few weeks ago I published an update piece on the Shotspotter's (SSTI) first reported quarter as a publicly traded company. I noted that revenues and gross margins were rising significantly and I viewed debt paydown as a wise move by management. Compared to the small market capitalization the market opportunity could be in excess of $1.4 billion according to CEO Ralph Clark, comprising 1,600 domestic and international cities, with places such as college campuses and centers of transportation. Even if the market opportunity were only $500 million to be more conservative, the company appeared significantly undervalued and in the early innings of adoption and growth.I will be the first to admit that weakness in the stock scared me out of the stock after earnings, but as I saw the share price strengthen I again initiated a stake for the ROTY (Runner of the Year) model account. Still cautious, I pointed out that I would need more convincing evidence and a break higher on the chart to add to the position. The bear argument that municipalities and other clients will find the price tag of the gunshot technology too expensive compared to modest benefits it provides could still hold water, as seen in the San Antonio case study.In a recent ROTY (Runner of the Year) entry I announced the model account would be adding more shares to its quarter sized pilot position, bringing the total position to half-size (or $5,000 out of a potential $10,000 stake that could be bought in the future). While I had yet to see strength in the stock price, I noted that additional anecdotal evidence from recent reports and closer examination increased my confidence in the story. Ever the cautious one, I still noted that I would need one of three things to happen for me to add more to our stake in the ROTY model account:I did not expect to revisit the story again so soon, but with material events occurring I thought it best to put out an update piece.The news making headlines has been that the Secret Service is conducting a test of the gunshot technology at the White House. The official press release states the following (unnecessary portions omitted):The news made waves on CNN and The Washington Post as well. My thoughts are that this is an obvious positive for the company- if adopted, it lends much credibility to the story as well as positive press. While I am aware that the quiet period expired not too long ago on July 17th, I still feel that management has not been doing the best job of getting their story out there and gaining visibility. At the same time, if I had to choose between management that keeps their heads down and lets their results speak for them versus overly promotional types often seen on Wall Street, I'd opt for the former.Another interesting piece of news came out of Fresno, California. The city is looking to pay up for another three years for the gunshot technology and the Fresno Unified School District (FUSD) voted to pitch in financially to aid the police department in funding the contract extension. The new pact would have the city funding 9 square miles and the school district providing for 6. Of note, 26 Fresno Unified school campuses were covered under the original area and if all goes according to plan later on 61 campuses will be covered.While the above represent encouraging developments for the company, my first words to current investors and readers would be to set aside emotion, beware hype and stay cautiously optimistic. The stock has a very small float that could result in significant volatility as the momentum crowd jumps on the bandwagon and daytraders use the stock as their personal playground.While the ROTY model account holds (or is soon to hold after market close according to our transparency rules) a half position, it does so with a near to medium term outlook.The company has its critics and the bear thesis is still valid to an extent. There is still the possibility that municipalities and other clients opt not to renew contracts in the event they feel the benefits are being outweighed by expenses incurred. While schools represent an important avenue for expansion, keep in mind there is quite a lot of opposition to the technology both from those who fear its ""big brother"" nature to those who oppose dollars from education diverted for adoption of Shotspotter instead of ""going to where it is supposed to"" (as seen in Fresno where there was plenty of dissent with the funding decision).To conclude, my outlook on the story is growing more positive while still keeping a close eye on the bear thesis. Readers looking to initiate or add to their positions should be watchful for volatility (significant spikes in share price)- if the price gets ahead of itself it's better to enjoy the ride upwards with whatever stake is already established, waiting for share price regression to add. For readers initiating a position, the same could be said for sitting on the sidelines and waiting for the share price to come back to a more palatable level before making a pilot purchase. While the news from the Secret Service is significant, we don't know the dollar amount attached to it nor what other contracts could come as a result.Author's note: My goal is to bring to readers' attention to undervalued stocks with catalysts that could propel shares higher, as well as provide a fresh perspective on stocks you may already be aware of.

The software solution is offered on a SaaS-based subscription model. Currently, the company has clients in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and South Africa. Their product, ShotSpotter Flex works within urban, high-crime areas by detecting and locating gunshots and sending real-time alerts to law enforcement. The company also offers SST SecureCampus and ShotSpotter SiteSecure, which are designed to help security on universities, corporate campuses, and critical infrastructure and transportation centers. Their solutions transmit validated sensor data along with a recorded digital file of the triggering sound to the companyâs Incident Review Center (IRC). There trained acoustic experts analyze the data and send it along to law enforcement typically in less than a minute. SpotShotter derives its revenue through annual subscriptions based upon deployment of their solutions on a per-square-mile basis. Through March 31, 2017, SpotShotter had 74 public safety clients covering approximately 450 square miles in 89 cities across the United States, including four of the ten largest cities.SpotShotter reported the following financial highlights for the third quarter ended September 30:President and CEO Ralph Clark has served SpotShotter since 2010. His previous experience comes from senior positions at GuardianEdge Technologies, Adaptec, IBM, Goldman Sachs, and Merrill Lynch. Mr. Clark holds a B.S. in economics from the University of the Pacific and an MBA from Harvard Business School.CFO Alan Stewart has served in his position since February 2017. He previously served as Managing Director at RA Capital Advisors. His other experience comes from positions at Epsilon Systems Solutions and FIT Advisors. Mr. Stewart was selected as San Diego Business Journal's CFO of the Year in 2007 and again in 2013. Both awards were in the large private business category. Mr. Stewart served over ten years as a submarine nuclear engineer in the United States Navy. He received his B.S. in Oceanography, with distinction, from the U.S. Naval Academy and his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.ShotSpotter notes in its SEC filing that its primary competitors are Thales Group, Safety Dynamics, Raytheon (RTN), and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. Morningstar lists SpotShotters peers as SAP (SAP), Adobe (ADBE), and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).SpotShotter Incorporatedâs IPO priced at $11 per share, at the midpoint of its expected price range of $11 to $13. The stock closed on the first day of trading at $14.38. Since then, the stock reached a low of $10.01 on August 2. But it has climbed steadily since then reaching a high of $19.65 on November 9. The stock currently trades in the $17 to $18 range.We believe that SSTI's previously restricted shareholders will be eager to cash in on some of their gains - SSTI has a return from IPO of nearly 59% - when SSTI's IPO lockup expires on December 4, 2017. This group of previously restricted shareholders includes five corporate entities and ten individuals. If even a portion of these shareholders elects to sell some of their previously restricted shares, the marketplace could be flooded and SSTI's share price could experience a sharp, short-term dip.We recommend that risk-tolerant investors establish a short position in SSTI ahead of the company IPO lockup expiration on December 4, 2017.

4140465,21798,2018-01-26T12:03:00-05:00,ShotSpotter has a key product to help law enforcement and first responders.ShotSpotter already secured customers in numerous major cities and campuses.I see plenty of room for growth as ShotSpotter expands.The company is expected to grow revenue at a strong pace over the next two years.,"The increased prevalence of active shooting situations in recent years created the need for ShotSpotterâs (SSTI) gunfire detection systems. These systems help alert law enforcement and first responders quickly to increase the chance of saving lives and to apprehend suspects. ShotSpotter is currently a small company with a $155 million market cap. The company is growing revenue at a strong double-digit pace. ShotSpotterâs growth will drive the stock to outperform over at least the next 2 years and probably longer.The ShotSpotter system accurately detects and locates gunfire. The system uses a combination of audio detection and software. The system can differentiate between gunfire and fireworks due to the difference in sound wavelengths. The company has 30 issued patents for this technology. The advantage of the system is that it can alert law enforcement and first responders when gunfire occurs. The system solves a key problem because gunfire goes unreported 8 out of 10 times. The ShotSpotter system makes the process of responding automatic where law enforcement and first responders can be notified directly on a mobile app or from 911 dispatchers. This eliminates the need to rely on witnesses calling 911 to respond to these situations. Source: shotspotter.com.I see this system as an important tool to help saves lives and to reduce gun violence over the long-term. Victims can be found in incidents that would otherwise be unreported. Finding gunshot victims on a timely basis can increase the chance that theyâll survive. As these systems become more prominent, they can act as a deterrent, and perhaps reduce gun violence in certain areas over time.ShotSpotterâs system is set up with customers on a subscription basis. These subscriptions are one to five year contracts (most are one-year contracts). The subscription model helps the company gain recurring revenue. ShotSpotter is currently used in over 80 cities/municipalities in the United States. It is also used in Cape Town, South Africa. There are hundreds of additional cities, states, and countries that ShotSpotter can expand into. The companyâs target market includes: 1,400 U.S. cities, 200 cities overseas, 5,000 campuses, and 1,800 transportation hubs. So, you can see that there is plenty of room for long-term growth. For the immediate future, analysts are expecting ShotSpotter to achieve revenue growth of 35% for 2018 and 36% for 2019. That strong growth will help drive the stock increase at above average rates. The company estimates that they have less than 5% penetration for their core market opportunity. ShotSpotter sees the following cities to grow into within the United States: Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Dallas, Baltimore, Seattle, Houston, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Puerto Rico. There are also ample opportunities to expand internationally. There are 200 cities in Latin America, South Africa, and Europe to expand into. ShotSpotter is working on hiring a Latin America Sales Director in Q1 2018. These efforts will help keep the company growing over many years. ShotSpotter recently announced an agreement with Verizon (VZ). The agreement allows ShotSpotter to employ its gun detection system on street lights that have Verizonâs Light Sensory Network installed. The use of Verizonâs Light Sensory Network on street lights makes it easier and more cost effective to install the ShotSpotter system in key areas. Verizonâs Light Sensory Network offers various services such as: traffic analytics, lighting control, parking optimization, and public safety support. So, adding gunshot detection would be a natural fit to assist municipalities to increase response time to gunfire incidents. This will help increase the chances of apprehending criminals and to save victimsâ lives. I see this agreement as an important catalyst for ShotSpotter. Having Verizon as a partner will help sell the ShotSpotter gun detection system to new cities/municipalities. The partnership is likely to help ShotSpotter expand over time. Verizonâs Light Sensory Network has over 42 smart city installations on a global basis. ShotSpotter can grow into these existing installations and grow along with Verizonâs new installations. It is possible that ShotSpotter could not receive renewals for certain contracts. For example, Charlotte-Mecklenburg did not renew their contract with ShotSpotter in 2016. Charlotte-Mecklenburg stated that they didnât see a return on investment for the system. So, ShotSpotter risks loss of revenue when customers donât see a benefit worth paying for. I havenât seen other cases of non-renewals. However, there have been discussions in other cities as they ponder the cost vs. benefits. For example, Oakland considered scrapping the system in 2014, but residents stated they felt safer with the system in place. Oakland is still using the system. So, resident perception of the system could be a key factor that can help ShotSpotter obtain renewed contracts. Most cities do see a benefit to the system. For example, Denver attributed 100 arrests to the ShotSpotter system over a 2-year period. Other major cities such as New York and Pittsburgh have renewed their contracts. I donât think there will be a major trend of contract non-renewals. I just wanted potential investors to realize that cities and other customers could consider not renewing when it comes time to discuss budgets and where cuts can be made. Overall, I think ShotSpotter has many years of strong growth ahead. The company is poised to grow revenue at 35% in 2018 and 36% in 2019 (consensus). ShotSpotter is also nearing profitability. This is projected to be in 2019 when analysts expect the company to achieve a pre-tax profit of $1.3 million as opposed to the expected -$1.32 million pre-tax loss for 2018.The stock is likely to drive higher on the basis of revenue growth since the company is still in a high growth expansion phase. The company is likely to continue to grow at a strong pace for the foreseeable future. There are many potential customers in the United States and abroad that can improve safety through faster response time with the ShotSpotter system.The Verizon partnership will help ShotSpotter grow and bring the brand more prominence. More awareness and further customer growth will bring ShotSpotter more into the spotlight for additional investors. That will help drive the stock higher. I think it is reasonable for the stock to increase at about 30% over the next year. The 35% growth in revenue and will help drive the stock. This gives the stock a one-year price target of $22."
4103719,101442,2017-09-01T15:27:50-04:00,Narrative from the pre-IPO valuation has not changed;The company has substantially and beyond expectations improved margins;Updated and revised-up valuation indicates more than 30% upside from current price level.,"Following my pre-IPO valuation of ShotSpotter (SSTI) on June 7, the company has successfully gone public and filed its first financial report as a listed company. In light of these events, I have decided to update my previous valuation in order to see whether any material change in the estimate is necessary.ThesisMy overall narrative has largely remained intact: I still view the total addressable market (TAM) for gunshot detection systems to be around $10.54 billion, given my conservative estimate I put forward in my original valuation article on SSTI. And I still believe the company has substantial growth opportunities, despite allocating it a market share of only 5% of TAM, given low industry adoption rate and anticipated higher competition. What has changed, however, is my expectation of how fast SSTI is going to evolve to reach its potential. Second quarter report â the first one for ShotSpotter as a public company â has shown not only a remarkable topline pace of growth but also improvements in gross and operating margins (even before adjusting the latter by capitalising R&D and operating lease expenses). To put it in perspective, the table below shows absolute and common-size TTM income statements for 2016 and 2017:As can be seen, gross margin has improved by 14 percentage points, while operating margin by 29pps. It is noteworthy that by looking at my original articleâs model, even including R&D and operating lease adjustments (which is net positive for operating margin), I expected it would take a year for adjusted operating margin to improve to -16%. In reality, it took the company just one quarter to prove otherwise.From an analyst expectations standpoint, there has been a revenue beat by $0.73mln and an EPS miss by $1.03. While the latter point might be troubling to some, it is essential to note that it has largely been impacted by the re-measurement of convertible preferred stock warrant, which used to be treated as a liability before the IPO (and marked to market causing this P&L impact) and has since been moved to the equity portion of the balance sheet (through additional paid-in capital, 10Q, p.9). This reclassification implies that no re-measurements will be reflected in the income statement in the future. Consequently, this non-cash item can also be treated as non-recurring and thus be removed, with an adjusted EPS miss of only $0.03.Interestingly, despite all this positive flow of data, there has been almost no change in share price. This is yet another motivating signal to re-value the stock to see how justified this neutral market reaction is.ValuationMost of the assumptions that I applied for fundamental value-driving factors, which I used in the pre-IPO valuation, have been preserved in this valuation. The primary reason for this is that there has been nothing to suggest I should change my narrative of SSTI being the disruptor in the industry of gunshot detection solutions, with inherent risk of being a young tech company faced with low adoption rate and potential future competition, which could compress the margins.As always, apart from these major assumptions, I have also considered the following:The table below presents the model output results:The estimated value per share of $17.18 is 33% above the August 31 closing price of $11.50. As usual, I have performed the Monte Carlo analysis to look at the range of possible per-share values, while making the following assumptions:As can be seen, the median value per share is $16.43, which is, unsurprisingly, close to my base case value of $17.18. From the percentiles table we can also see that there is about a 75% chance the stock price at current level of $11.5 is undervalued. ConclusionWith updated financials, my pre-IPO valuation of $14.88 has improved to $17.18 per share. As I can see it, the company is in-line with my expectations, especially in terms of margin improvement. It is strange, therefore, the market has been slow so far to identify the potential ShotSpotter has. With my estimated value of $17.18 and the current price hovering around $11.5, there is more than 30% upside potential in the stock, which I believe can be realized within 1-2-year time frame.It is also possible the company may be an acquisition target for established defense-sector companies (Raytheon, for example), which have limited scope point protection sensors (also known as âcounter-sniper systems) requiring directional aiming and mainly used by the military personnel, but virtually nothing to offer in terms of public security and sensors with wider system of protection covering large areas."
4186201,21815,2018-07-09T18:14:36-04:00,"The company has an attractive technology for which there is a large market and little competition.Growth is very substantial and the company is already generating operational leverage and are close to profitability.While the shares are expensive, substantial growth, market entrenchment and opportunities, and improving operational metrics justify a high valuation.","Shotspotter (SSTI) is a company that produces sensors which detect gunfire. You might wonder what the use of that is, but it's pretty straightforward. Police relies on people to call 911 to notify them for gun use but this isn't always happening, especially in the more gun ridden tough neighborhoods.This is where Shotspotter comes in with their technology with their acoustic detection technology which automatically notifies the police, from Buzzworthy:The company's solutions include:Since any actual gun restriction is unlikely in the US but with authorities under increasing pressure to at least do something, the climate is good for technological solutions like the ones Shotspotter is offering.But it's not only in the US that the field is wide open for their technology, the company is also eyeing markets abroad, especially those where there is a lot of gun violence like Middle and South America. Here is CEO Ralph Clark (Q1CC):But of course the US is their first target, and they have ongoing expansion in places like Chicago and Baltimore where gun crime is rife. These projects are interesting (Q1CC):The Baltimore project is actually funded by a $5M grant from a charity (Bloomberg Philanthropies), which could suggest funding is dependent on the goodwill of philanthropist, but this isn't a worry for management, Ralph Clark (Q1CC):He also mentioned growing interest from the Federal government (which has a $25M budget for solutions like this, with ongoing discussions about expanding that) as well as state governments, driven by a need for action and positive reviews for the company's earlier projects in cities like Chicago, Cincinnati and Louisville.Progress in Chicago is very solid, at the end of the quarter 47 square miles were covered, but this has increased to over 100 square miles at the time of the CC, even if this is a booked number and not actually a live deployment.The company claims the following advantages of their detection technology:Is there evidence that this actually leads to reduced shootings? This from an interview with the CEO two years ago in Forbes:But this is the CEO talking here, and others argue that there is no real evidence, here is Jennifer Doleac from the University of Virginia, in the Cincinnati Inquirer:No real evidence (at least not independent evidence) doesn't mean it's not effective and the Forbes article also notes other interesting info emerging from the data, here is the CEO again:Management argues in an investor presentation that just 20% of gunshots are reported to the police:Gun violence is the obvious application, especially in the US and it's the one which the company started out with. But there are other use cases which the company is working on:With respect to the latter, the company has a deal with GE to apply the tech in its smart city lightening, which required little adaptation as most of the elements (GPS, etc.) were already present, opening up new opportunities and pricing models (price per city, rather than per mile, etc.)The company has a similar deal with Verizon for putting Shotspotter's tech into Verizon's Light Sensory Network.Here is what the company argued in December on a recent investor presentation which are the most important investor take-aways:Perhaps the stand-out issue is the fact that they're only just beginning, they've covered just a fraction of the US city areas, and then there are the campuses, the opportunities abroad, the additional use cases.What's also pretty relevant is its SaaS business model, with nearly 100% of revenues are recurring: And the economics of this are pretty stellar:We're not sure that revenue retention rate is all that telling as for now at least the company's land and expand strategy simply involves adding additional geographical coverage, not different services. It's still nice though, as it indicates satisfied customers.Well, demand for their solution is robust, and this has led to a really substantial rally in the share price:And this isn't terribly surprising, as the company is delivering fast growth:SSTI Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsFrom a recent investor presentation (post Q1 2018 results):The company earns by square mile installed plus a service fee (yes, that is actually a SaaS based business model). As an indication of the amounts involved, here is the Cincinnati Inquirer:So that's about $75K per square mile. The company covered 47 net new square miles (+62%) in Q1 2018 but warned that as these figures are lumpy, it's better to judge on a longer (yearly) perspective. The total mileage covered reached 522 square miles at the end of Q1.Q1 Revenues were up 51% (y/y) to $6.9M, the company is still in hypergrowth territory.SSTI Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsGross margins was up 300 basis points (y/y) to 52% and management expects gross margin expansion to improve further during the year.Operating expenses were growing a bit faster than revenues in the quarter (57% versus 51%) and amounted to $4.8M in Q1. S&M declined from 24% of revenues to 22% in the past year, the decline in R&D as a percentage of revenues was steeper as it declined from 23% to 18% (y/y).On the other hand, G&A increased considerably, from 20% of revenues a year ago to 29% in Q1.SSTI Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe company used $2.2M cash in operations in Q1 but still has $14.8M left (at the end of Q1) and no debt. Here is what management had to say about this (Q1CC):If cash is already back up then Q2 promises to be a lot better, perhaps even operational cash flow positive.After the strong Q1 results, management increased the outlook for the full year, from $31M-$33M to $33M-$34M. The company also expects to reach GAAP profitability by the end of the year as well. Here is the company's longer term model:The valuation is of course terrific:SSTI EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsAnd what's notable is that the the valuation has basically tripled this year.The company has a unique product for which there is rising demand and, at least for now, little competition. Expansion is still in the early stages even in the US, and there are considerable opportunities abroad as well.If the company can deliver on their expectations of GAAP profitability by the end of the year, the high sales multiple might matter considerably less. The company is already adjusted EBITDA profitable, if only just."
4110590,26671,2017-09-29T11:31:42-04:00,"ShotSpotterâs equipment detects gunshots in high crime areas. It has no direct competition.After tinkering with its business model a few years ago, revenues have taken off and profitability is close.Revenue is mostly recurring. It is by subscription and the retention rate was 127% in 2016.Buying ShotSpotter now is a chance to buy into another breakthrough law enforcement product ahead of the curve (think Taser).","There has been significant new technology in recent years to help police departments fight crime. In 1968, the 911 telephone number was created to report crimes. The National Crime Information Center was created by the FBI around the same time to centralize crime information. Technology to recognize a personâs DNA started in 1986. Police departments started using computers in the 1970s though only for routine tasks until much later.In the 1990s, the Taser was introduced to apprehend a suspect in a confrontational situation. Taser the company, now known as Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAXN) grew rapidly and today has a market cap of $1.2 billion. It has since expanded into software and sensors and continues to grow rapidly. Buying ShotSpotter (NASDAQ:SSTI) today is a chance to buy into another breakthrough law enforcement product ahead of the curve. Both serve the same market, primarily law enforcement. ShotSpotterâs technology to detect and precisely locate gunshots is the latest tool for police departments and is seeing rapid adoption after a slow beginning.Like Axon early on, ShotSpotter is essentially a one-product company. It creates systems that detect gunshots. It can pinpoint the exact location of the gunshot and type of weapon used. The company does this by placing noise sensors throughout the area served. It takes three or more sensors to pinpoint the location. A report of the time and location of the gunshots is immediately analyzed by the company and sent to the local police usually within a minute. Results were spotty initially as the police departments buying the service did their own analysis of the data that came in. ShotSpotter fixed this by creating its own central command for all customers manned 24/7. ShotSpotter charges about $65,000-85,000 per square mile covered per year. Almost all revenues are under contracts and are recurring. Its customer retention rate was 116% in 2015 and 127% in 2016. ShotSpotter uses this metric instead of churn and it indicates revenues from existing customers increased by 27% in 2017. Being over 100% means it is actually picking up more business from existing customers than it is losing. It went to the subscription revenue model in 2011.On June 7, 2017, the company issued 3,200,000 shares in its initial IPO priced at $11.00.This company is starting to garner attention. On September 21, 2017, Time Magazine published a very good article.The company has no direct competitors and there are several barriers to entry. The first is a portfolio of 31 patents. The process is operationally challenging with multiple sensors, time differentials, the need to train staff to read the reports and quickly report to the local police, and to understand how local weather conditions affect the reports. ShotSpotter also has the first mover advantage and has reached a critical mass where most police departments are now aware of the service. A new competitor would have a significant learning curve and upfront costs before their offering compares to ShotSpotter.There are no independent studies yet that prove ShotSpotter reduces crime, though there is plenty of anecdotal evidence. According to Time Magazine:ShotSpotterâs service shows police where a higher level of gunshots is so they can put more police in the area. Some published reports suggest at least 80% of gunshots in cities are unreported. The ShotSpotter system allows police to respond to more incidents and respond more quickly than when they are called in.While the company floundered initially, growth has been rapid in recent years as shown below:Source: Author from the S-1 filing and last 10-Q.The large loss in the first half of 2017 was primarily due to a $3.73 million non-cash non-recurring remeasurement of a preferred stock warrant. With the recent IPO, most of the interest expense and all of the warrants have gone away.Financial results are accelerating. While revenues were up 31.5% in 2016, they were up 49.0% in the first half of 2017. In the second quarter of 2017, they were up 50.2% from the prior year quarter and 27.9% from the previous or linked quarter. EBITDA in the second quarter of 2017 was $568,000 assuming depreciation was the same as the first quarter.As of June 30, 2017, the company had 75 municipal customers with coverage areas of approximately 480 square miles in 90 cities across the United States, including four of the ten largest cities. On September 19, 2017, it announced it had acquired seven new cities including Cincinnati, Louisville and Jacksonville, Florida. Also, three existing cities including New York City and Chicago were expanding their service; New York from 24 to 60 square miles.Management has recently guided to be cash flow positive by late 2017 and GAAP profitable by late 2018. In fact, it is already EBITDA positive. After the second quarter, management guided for revenues of $21.5 to $22.5 million in 2017. This indicates that there will be no growth from the second quarter to the third and fourth quarters. However, the new business announcement on September 19, 2017, has already made that out of date and conservative.It is very important to note that the company has high fixed costs which juice earnings as revenues increase. For example, in the first half of 2017, 58 cents of every dollar of new revenue (over the prior year period) dropped right to operating income. Operating income is likely to be similar to net income for the foreseeable future. This is because interest expense will soon to be gone, and there will be no taxes due for years due to $75 million of Federal and $54 million of State NOLs. There are several reasons for the high earnings percentage to every dollar of new revenue. First of all, the cost of the 24/7 command center has been paid. This center can handle significant new growth with little additions to staffing or equipment. Also, the cost of equipment in the field is mostly fixed. It is being depreciated over five years but should have a significantly longer average life. Research and development has also been flat over the past year along with sales and marketing. The company will be adding sales staff to start international sales so that line item should start increasing. The gross margin was 54% in the most recent quarter, up from 38% one year earlier. Management expects to get this number to 65% or greater eventually.Following the IPO, the company had $35 million of cash on June 30, 2017, and $13.1 million of interest bearing debt. Management expects to repay all interest bearing debt shortly, which will eliminate interest expense. Business is moderately seasonal with the second and fourth quarters having more revenues added.The following is an estimate of cash flow going forward:Source: Author using the assumptions below.(1) Assumes revenues increase 10% in the second half of 2017 from the second quarter, 30% in 2018, 25% in 2019, and 20% in 2020 and 2021.(2) Assumes the gross margin goes from 58% in the second half of 2017 in a straight line to 65% in 2020.(3) Assumes sales & marketing expense increases at 75% the rate revenues increase.(4) Assumes R&D increases 10% a year, midway between the rate in 2016 and 2017 to date.(5) Assumes G&A expense increases at 80% the rate revenues increase.(6) Assumes depreciation increases at 90% the rate revenues increase.The growth estimate assumes little business outside the U.S. It is highly likely that will change, particularly in high crime areas such as in South America, Africa and parts of Asia.A company with a growth rate of 20% often trades at a P/E of 30x or more. With ShotSpotter not currently paying any income taxes, 20-35x might be a reasonable multiple. At a P/E of 25x, the market cap would $272.6 million. The company has more than sufficient cash to fund operations through 2021 so I am assuming only 10% more shares for management incentives. My price target in 2021 is projected at $26.01 based on 10% more shares than now and the $272.6 million market cap estimate. Using a 12% discount rate to account for the new business model indicates a present value of $16.52. The growth projections are conservative as ShotSpotter has no competition, is currently growing faster than my projections, and assumes little international sales. It also assumes SG&A will grow almost as fast as sales, which has not been the case and appears conservative.1. As noted above, currently over half of new revenues are dropping to the bottom line. Some additional spending is expected in sales and marketing, but the percentage of revenues dropping to earnings should remain large going forward.2. This market is mostly untapped and there is a huge runway to pick up new revenues. The majority of U.S. cities currently do not have this service or are just tapping their toe in the water. With one exception, the entire foreign market is untapped. The last SA article on ShotSpotter by Timur Mirzaev estimated an addressable market of over $10 billion per year. Management has given a $1.4 billion figure. I believe both are high, but even if it is only $500 million, ShotSpotter has only penetrated 4% of the market.3. Institutional investors were only 20% of shareholders on June 30, 2017, very low for an exchange traded stock over $5.00. This number should increase as more become aware of ShotSpotter.4. Violent crime rates have been increasing recently in inner cities creating more demand. Also, the emergence of groups like Black Lives Matter show that residents of those neighborhoods are pushing police harder to reduce crime.1. No competition2. Significant barriers to entry3. Growth is accelerating4. Strong balance sheet after the IPO5. Infrastructure is in place to grow rapidly without major new investmentThere is no independent study yet showing the effectiveness of ShotSpotter in reducing crime. It clearly does other things such as decrease response time, indicate higher problem areas, and reports more incidents. According to Time Magazine âShotSpotter does publish year-end summaries, which offer a partial glimpse. Among the claims: gunfire incidents decrease 34.7% within the first two years of departments using the system.âThere are some privacy concerns with all the listening devices. However, most cities have many outdoor cameras now which are a bigger privacy issue.The company is not yet profitable. However, with the recent growth rate, the pending repayment of all interest bearing debt, and amount of revenues falling to the bottom line, it should be profitable soon.There are lockups from the IPO which expire in December, six months after the IPO.I see two reasons for the current low stock price. First of all, ShotSpotter is facing the post IPO blues. It was initially priced at $11 and moved up to the $14 level until mid-July when it drifted down to the current $11-12 level. This is despite a strong earnings report on August 9th. This has been common with IPOs recently, strong initial trading followed by a selloff. A second reason is the flat revenue guidance for the current quarter and fourth quarter of 2017. However, the recent new business announcement makes significant revenue growth likely in the fourth quarter.Things should change as ShotSpotter establishes itself with institutional investors. It has as much potential as Axon. In fact, it has a better business model, in that most revenues are recurring and there is less litigation risk. ShotSpotter closed yesterday at $11.84. I recommend purchasing ShotSpotter stock with a one year target of $18.50. This is a three-year discount at 12% from my 2021 estimated price of $26.01."
4086763,24589,2017-07-10T16:39:06-04:00,"Technology appears to be positioned in the right place at the right time.Shares have traded relatively flat since the IPO but I expect that to change.Valuation appears reasonable in light of growth prospects, while small cash position still appears sufficient to progress the story forward to future inflection points.This is still a high risk story, but investors have multiple ways to win via accelerating sales and potential headlines that could bring the name to public awareness.","At the beginning of June ShotSpotter Inc (SSTI) priced its initial public offering at $11 per share, raising $30.8 million in the process. Lead underwriters for the deal were Roth Capital Partners, Imperial Capital and Northland Capital Partners.Since that time, shares have traded relatively flat but I expect that to change as the stock comes out of its quiet period, which ends on the 17th of this month.The firm's basic premise is that they offer real-time gunshot alerts and detection. According to their website, eight out of every 10 gunfire events go unreported to 911, presenting a quandary to law enforcement as they are unable to respond to an event if it goes unreported.Briefly, the company deploys gunfire-specific acoustic sensing technology throughout a given community, and these sensors identify (and time-stamp) noises they are programmed to detect, thus being able to classify the type of gunshot and triangulate the position from which it came within 30 to 45 seconds of the weapon being fired. Obviously, in theory this could significantly improve response times and save lives. Digital alerts to law enforcement and first responders add a digital edge to the story that makes this even more interesting.Press releases throughout 2017 show various communities adopting the technology, most recently in North St. Louis County where 21 homicides have occurred so far this year. As an example, on Monday when Shotspotter was turned on the police department received 18 notifications of shots fired and made one arrest.A recent Business Insider article presents another case study where detectors picked up sounds of shots from a gang shooting.Captain David Salazar (Milwaukee PD) went on record as saying the technology has been ""incredibly helpful"" and led to lives being saved, with accuracy of GPS coordinates being surprisingly accurate.While ratings by Northstar and Roth should be taken with a grain of salt considering both were involved in the IPO, respective price targets of $16 and $18 indicate substantial upside.With a market capitalization slightly in excess of $100 million and a small but sufficient cash position, readers should remember the company did sales of $15.5 million in 2016 (31% growth over the prior year). Assuming operating losses of around $1 million or so in each quarter going forward, the cash position should be sufficient to allow the business to progress throughout 2017 and half of 2018 before dilution or other funding might be accessed. Sales for the first quarter of 2017 amounted to $4.6 million and a valuation of 4 to 6 times sales seems quite reasonable to me.There are several ways for investors to win here, with the first being management continuing to execute and accelerating adoption of the firm's technology. For those who have followed me over the past year, you know that I like being positioned in stocks where excess optimism and hype provide the potential for outsized gains.Risks to the story include slowing sales, outspoken opponents of the technology who criticize its cost, concerns as to its effectiveness, and the ""big brother"" nature of constantly monitoring activity. While I don't anticipate future dilution in 2017 or the first half of 2018, it's always possible that management taps capital markets again in order to extend their operational runway.Shares appear to be basing at the $13 level and although it has a lack of trading history, readers who have done their due diligence and are interested in the story could initiate a pilot position in the near future, waiting for future earnings and news to provide further clarification.There's always the chance that the stock shows weakness and significant volatility in the near future, but it's a risk I'm willing to take knowing that it only takes a few headlines to set this one off.Author's note: My goal is to bring to readers' attention undervalued stocks with catalysts that could propel shares higher, as well as provide a fresh perspective on due diligence and making trades.

4080273,25120,2017-06-09T10:57:13-04:00,"ShotSpotter is a very small, but very interesting IPO.The companyÂ´s solutions can really make a difference at a relative low cost.I think that this speculative play might be a great investment, as long as you tolerate and understand the risks.","ShotSpotter (SSTI) is a very interesting and very small IPO. The company provides a great gunshot detection solutions which allows cities, law enforcement and security staff to quickly respond to shootings. This creates a decent improvement in public security at a relatively low cost, which makes that I think that better days are ahead for this company.A modest valuation, narrowing losses and decent product, makes that ShotSpotter appears to be a nice speculative opportunity, provided that you have a high tolerance for risk.A Great Business PurposeShotSpotter describes itself as the leading gunshot detection solutions company, used by both law enforcement and security personnel. The core Flex product detects and locates gunshots (through sensors), after which alerts are sent to law enforcement or security staff about the location of a shooting.Not only are these responders notified of a shooting much faster than waiting for a traditional call report, many shootings are not even reported! The speed at which the system works is very impressive, as indoor shootings are transmitted within 10 seconds, while outdoor shootings take up to 45 seconds.Even better, security staff or law enforcement can even receive these notifications directly on their phones, as acoustic experts can even warn staff for multiple shooters, or even if high-capacity weapons are being used.This software solution is sold as a SaaS solution, which creates recurring revenue streams. As of the end of the first quarter, the company had 74 public safety customers with coverage of 450 square miles in 89 cities. The company furthermore had 6 security customers which cover 7 education campuses.The problem of gun violence is a big one in the US. The FBI reckons that 1.2 million violent crimes took place in 2015, of which 330,000 included the use of gun violence. Worse, upto 90% of the gunshots detected by the solutions of the company are not even called in by residents. Of the remaining gun shots calls often come to late in order to prevent a continuation of the shooting in case of a mass shooting event, or to arrest the shooter on the spot.The potential is large, the company believes that there are 1,400 cities in the US alone which have more than 4 homicides per 100,000 residents. If such a city would use the services of the company at a price tag of $400,000 a year, the potential target market is large at +$500 million.The Offering and ValuationShotSpotter sold 2.8 million shares at $11 per share in its IPO, raising $31 million in gross proceeds at a price which was in the middle of the preliminary offering range of $10-$12 per share.There are 9.1 million shares outstanding following the offering, which values equity of the business at exactly $100 million. As shares rose to $13 in subsequent trading action, the value of the company has risen to $11 8million. As some of the proceeds from the IPO will be used to pay down debt, net cash holdings stand at $15 million following the offering, valuing operating assets at $103 million.The company posted sales of $15.5 million in 2016, a +31% increase compared to the year before. Operating losses fell from $5.5 million to $5.0 million at the same time. Based on the valuation of the operating assets, the company trades at 6.6 times sales, but given the losses it is hard to apply any valuation metric at all on the business. The good news is that growth accelerated in the first quarter of this year, as sales were up 50% to $4.6 million, while operating losses narrowed from $1.8 million to $1.2 million.Based on the narrowing loss rate, I am not that worried about the cash position melting away, noticing that operating losses totaled just $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Growth and leverage should make that the break-even point would potentially come in sight this year as revenue growth continues.The annualized revenue rate is quickly approaching the $20 million mark, which makes that the valuation looks potentially reasonable given the solid and accelerating growth rate, as well as the great product which the company provides.Final ThoughtsShotSpotter has great potential in my eyes. The solution is relatively low-cost and brings real benefits in addressing public safety, especially as public outcry about shootings continues to be a hot item.The downside is the reliance on governmental-agencies, the associated problems with funding at times, but perhaps the biggest risk is detection of false positives, or even worse the missing of potential shootings. That said, growth and growth potential, narrowing losses, great product, and relatively modest valuation makes that this potentially is a great growth story. I would furthermore not be surprised to see takeover interest arise for the business as well.A small speculative position seems warranted, provided that you have a high tolerance for risk."

Perhaps this is due to improving city finances as the overall economy continues to mend.In any event, the company is proposing to value itself at $118 million post-IPO on a forward twelve-month revenue run rate of $18 million, resulting in a Price/Sale multiple of 6.6x.While we donât have a comparable multiple since ShotSpotter has no direct competitors, this multiple seems reasonable, given the companyâs expected 16% year-over-year topline revenue growth rate.I previously wrote in detail about ShotSpotterâs IPO prospects in my article, ShotSpotter Seeks To Raise $35 Million In IPO.In that article, I highlighted that its financial performance is improving, with growing gross margin and topline revenues.I also noted that it has a dominant market position and enviable prospects for future growth since management has identified 1,400 metropolitan areas that are potential customers.The company also has a growing revenue retention rate and decreasing sales and marketing spend per $1.00 of new annualized contract value.Given its reasonable valuation expectation, prospects for growth and improving financials, my opinion on the IPO is a BUY.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

4079505,101442,2017-06-07T10:52:59-04:00,"Number of shooting incidents in the US is on the rise, necessitating a need for public security solutions;ShotSpotter is a software company offering its gunshot detection products in an industry with TAM of $10.5bln;The estimated value per share is $14.88, or more than 25% above the mid-range IPO price of $11;Furthermore, Monte Carlo analysis shows that there is a 60% chance of the IPO offering undervaluing the company;Industry adoption rate, strict government budget allocations, potential new competition and only local networking benefits are the risks to consider.","With ShotSpotter (NASDAQ:SSTI) filing the S-1 statement in anticipation of its IPO, I have decided to value the company in order to see whether the offered price range of $10-$12 is fair. From what will follow, I provide my narrative for the company as well as the valuation, using my usual methodology.ThesisThe technological progress has made it possible to improve life in almost every possible way. Changing dynamics in one area often create appealing opportunities to apply technological progress for the benefit of both society and businesses. One such area is public security, specifically gun-shot detection solutions. As can be seen from the chart below, there is a clear upward trend in the number of shooting incidents in the US from 2014 to 2016.Source: Gun Violence ArchiveAs a result, there is a need to detect and notify the law enforcement authorities of any gun violence as soon as it occurs, so as to mitigate the risk and enhance the security - and ShotSpotter is an avid example of just that. By deploying sensors and using its proprietary software to filter out any noises but the gun shots, the company is able to notify the authorities of the precise location, number of shooters, and weapon type within 45 seconds for outdoor (via the ShotSpotter Flex product) and 10 seconds for indoor incidents (via the ShotSpotter SecureCampus and ShotSpotter SiteSecure products). SSTI offers its solutions on the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) per-square-mile basis with contracts ranging from one to five years in length. As of March 31, 2017, the company covered 450 square miles of outdoor area along with seven higher-education campuses.Despite being formed in 2001, the company is still in its infancy, as judged upon relatively low TTM revenues of only $17 million, partly due to the low industry adoption rate in the past and the fact that most of the company's clients are government entities, contracting with which (by company's own admission) ""can be complex, expensive, and time-consuming"" (S-1/A1, p. 14). However, the rising number of gun violence incidents implies that the industry is bound to grow.To estimate the potential size of the industry, or Total Addressable Market (TAM) - taking into account the fact that SSTI generates its revenues on per-square-mile basis - I first looked at how much the company generates in the form of revenues per square mile (given lack of information, the fact that SecureCampus and SiteSecure solutions comprised a meager 1% of total revenues in 2016 (S-1, p.53), and the company admitting itself to continue to have Flex as its major contributor to revenues going forward, the analysis that follows will completely ignore the market potential in this area, though with time we should expect it to have a higher revenue pie). Given TTM revenues of $17 million and 450 square miles of covered area reported in S-1 filing (p. 1), it turns out the company charges close to $38K, on average, per square mile per year. However, that figure can be significantly underestimated looking forward, as judged upon 2016 official purchase agreements between SSTI and cities/counties, which have been made available thanks to Open Public Records Act. Those documents (here and here) show that the rate charged on per-square-mile basis for ShotSpotter Flex product in 2016 is $65K per year (excluding one-time installation, training, and application program license fees), growing at 5% per year upon contract extension (there is no way to know for certain but possible reasons for this divergence can be attributed to lower per-square-mile rates in the past and lengthy contracts of five years tied up to that lower rate). Taking into account possible dilutive effects from new competition in the future, I ignored 5% growth rate and took $65K per square mile as the base number. In the next step, I assumed that the company's addressable market would be urbanized (since this is where the crime involving guns is most likely to occur) US areas and some international cities. For the former, my choice was predicated on the premise that having a first-mover advantage and being incorporated in the US, ShotSpotter is well positioned to grow its US business in urban areas country-wide. On the other hand, international expansion is most likely to be limited to cities with higher-than-average rates of gun violence. On this occasion, I took a relatively conservative approach by selecting top ten cities by homicide in each region of the world: North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Oceania). Shifting to some numbers, with 3.53 million square miles of total US land area (US Census Bureau, 2010), of which 3.5% is urbanized (US Census Bureau, 2015), the US market potential can estimated to be more than $8.03 billion. Similarly, top ten most dangerous cities in each region cover about 38,586 square miles in total (city-by-city Google search), or around $2.51 billion in potential revenues. As a result, the total market opportunity, or TAM, is as much as $10.54 billion.Not surprisingly, this industry potential has already attracted (and will continue to) increased attention from the competitors, given its TAM and virtually no barriers to entry. According to the SSTI's filing, even though the company does not see any direct competitors to its outdoors wide-area products, it lists such companies as Raytheon Company, Safety Dynamics, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, and Thales Group as competing marginally by means of their shot-detection sensors, which offer only point protection (instead of wide-area protection) and are mostly suited for military personnel. Additionally, but even more tangentially, ShotSpotter mentions such companies as Everbridge (critical communications platform) and Axon (developer of smart products for law enforcement market) as competing for government budget.ValuationBased on the information provided in the previous section, my short narrative for the company, which will form the basis for each assumption in this section, is as follows: ShotSpotter is a tech company focused on the burgeoning industry of gunshot detection solutions. By the very nature the technology functions, it will allow the company to enjoy local (within a given city) networking benefits (implying that once installed in a city, there is a potential for city-wide expansion), thus positively affecting its market share; though increased competition will noticeably limit both market share and profit margin expansions, and low market adoption rate will put another cap on growth potential. On a separate note, to underpin its growth, SSTI will have to have commensurately high rate of reinvestment through R&D, acquisitions, and PP&E. Finally, being a loss-making company in the still-growing industry, the level of risk in the near future is going to be high, though decreasing at later stages as the company grows and improves its profitability.That being said, I will now move on to the assumptions linked to that narrative:Quite obviously, reinvestments do not end after year 10, and we have to make an assumption for that as well. The terminal period reinvestment rate will be computed, based on:Sustainable growth = ROIC * reinvestment rateGiven an assumed sustainable growth rate during the terminal period equal to 2.14% (10-year treasuries) and an ROIC of 8% (which assumes the company will not be able to sustain its competitive advantage in the long-term and, thus, achieve an ROIC equal to the terminal period WACC of 8% (global medium)), will give a reinvestment rate of:Reinvestment rate = 2.14% / 8% = 26.75%;Apart from these major assumptions, I have also considered the following:The table below presents the model output results:The estimated value per share is $14.88, or more than 25% above the mid-range IPO price. As usual, I have performed the Monte Carlo analysis to look at the range of possible per-share values, with making the following assumptions:As can be seen, the median value per share is almost $14, which is close to my base case value of $14.88. From the percentiles table we can also see that there is a 60% chance the IPO offering at mid-range price of $11 is undervalued. On the cautionary note, however, there is a mere 0.2% chance SSTI is worthless.ConclusionIn valuing ShotSpotter, I have tried to be cautious on several fronts by applying a low market share (with concerns over the market adoption rate, competition, and only local networking benefits), linear margin adjustment over time (letting economies of scale kick-in not immediately, given my fear of low rate of market adoption), and relatively high risk (by putting the WACC the 99th percentile). Nevertheless, the resulting value is more than 25% higher than the mid-range IPO price, with 60% probability of the IPO offering undervaluing the company. Moreover, from the simulation chart above we can see a positive right-hand skew in the predicted values, thereby signifying the fact that the ""true"" value per share might be even higher, should the company be more successful than assumed herein in utilizing its potential."
4096698,24589,2017-08-09T02:01:14-04:00,"This ROTY position looks to head higher tomorrow after a solid quarter.Revenues and gross margins are rising significantly and management has raised full year guidance.Paying down debt is a positive turn of events, but the reduced cash position could be a cause for concern at some point.The company appears to be in the early innings of an exciting growth phase, but the valuation still is quite reasonable.Future outperformance in the near to medium term is likely, while significant risks shouldn't be discounted.","After reporting second quarter results yesterday, shares of ShotSpotter are basically resting where they were when I first proposed the stock as a ROTY candidate.Key points to my original rationale for expecting significant upside in the next 12 months included the following:Keep in mind that in the ROTY model account we had added to our position in ShotSpotter based on bullishness on the company's prospects. In the past couple weeks it had become our worst performing position (20%) and I was worrying that maybe we went in too deep prior to their first time reporting quarterly earnings as a public company. I had told readers to stick with a quarter position, but I went in aggressively for the ROTY model account.Quarterly revenues grew 48% to $5.8 million (up from $3.9 million in the second quarter of 2016). In fact, revenues accelerated as they increased 28% over the first quarter of 2017!Gross margins rose to 54%, again increasing over the same period last year (38%) and the first quarter of the present year (41%). Management raised full year guidance, with the low end range of $21.5 million and a projected high end of $22.5 million. They've also stated that gross margins should continue rising to a goal of around 65% or so. Operating expenses of $3.3 million increased by 12%, while net loss amounted to $4.3 million. The total cash position of $35.1 million will be reduced substantially in the near term, as the firm will pay back its outstanding loan balance of $13.5 million.The new metric of ""net new go-live square miles"", which refers to square miles covered by deployments approved by customers net of square miles that ceased to be âliveâ during the quarter, is interesting but I believe it will only be useful going forward as we are able to compare the metric to past quarters. For the second quarter the firm added 44 net new âgo-liveâ square miles.CEO Ralph Clark pointed to a $1.4 billion market opportunity comprised of 1,600 domestic and international cities, with places such as college campuses and centers of transportation standing to benefit from the technology as well.If full year earnings come in around $22 million, the stock is trading at a cheap 4.5 times sales or so. I believe management is sandbagging and could raise guidance again if momentum continues and their technology continues to see heavy adoption. Even if the potential addressable market were only half of the $1.4 billion figure cited, the stock still appears quite cheap taking into account expansion opportunities and how early in the growth cycle it is. I wouldn't be surprised to see management wait until the stock runs up to $20 or so and tap capital markets in a secondary offering, selling another million shares or so to accelerate expansion efforts and extend the operating runway. In the near term look for increased analyst coverage as Wall Street starts paying closer attention to this growth story in its early innings. For readers who are interested in the story, if shares don't jump too much tomorrow present levels are still an enticing entry point. Risks include a slowdown in sales and expansion, as well customers being turned off potentially by the price tag of the technology or ""misfires"" and malfunctions. I also believe dilution in the medium term is a possibility, as management might want to augment the cash position after paying doubt debt.Another important risk is the low float nature of the stock, which coupled with a decent short position could lead to increased volatility. This could work in our favor if the stock sees a series of ""parabolic spikes"", but readers looking to purchase shares should use limit orders (as always and especially in this case). The stock could also be subject to manipulation by either momentum bulls or shorts, as is often the case with low float situations. Author's note: My goal is to bring to readers' attention undervalued stocks with catalysts that could propel shares higher, as well as provide a fresh perspective on stocks you may already be aware of.

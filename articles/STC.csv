I know. Get a hobby. I've heard it before. Anyway, I was struck by the line that the company wants to ""target annualized revenue growth across all lines of business independent of market conditions."" That is an intriguing statement. The fact that the shares are up about 13% over the past year intrigued me further. Perhaps this is some sort of perpetual money machine that generates sales in spite of what's happening in the economy. It prompted me to look in on the name. I must say that I don't like disappointments. It turns out that this is actually a company that doesn't make a lot of money and the shares are expensively priced. We recommend avoiding the name. We expand on these ideas below.BackgroundAccording to the company's website, Stewart is a global title insurance and real estate services company that offers products and services through its direct operations, network of approved agencies and other companies within the Stewart family. It provides these services to home buyers and sellers; residential and commercial real estate professionals; mortgage lenders and servicers; title agencies and real estate attorneys; home builders; and the United States government. What we found particularly entertaining about the business is that it describes itself as ""customer-focused."" As opposed to what? What company describes itself as ""anti-customer?"" We'd recommend that if the company wants to add some filler to the ""about"" section, it should also tell us that it's a company run entirely by humans.Operating ProfitAlthough the investor presentation talks about the fact that the company is generating excess revenue, we'd remind investors that it's operating profits that are the source of all sustainable shareholder wealth. Investors aren't compensated with sales. They're compensated with residual cash flows after paying operational expenses. When we compare the level of operating profits the company generates relative to the capital employed, we find that over the past four quarters, it has generated less of an operating yield than the risk-free rate.Source: Company filingsAdmittedly, the operating cash flows dropped a great deal because of the recent goodwill writedown. The writedown is obviously problematic but to strip out its impact would cause the operating cash flow yield to jump to only about 3.3%, or ~1% greater than the risk-free rate. We consider this to be an inadequate level of operating profit relative to the capital employed. Given that the impairment charge actually happened, the level of operating profits are well below the risk-free rate. This is obviously inadequate given all of the risks present.The writedown happened because the company decided last quarter to leave the delinquent loan servicing operations, which caused the $35.9 million in charges against goodwill and other intangibles in the mortgage services segment. This goodwill impairment charge eliminates all goodwill associated with the legacy mortgage service operation. We're not overly surprised that goodwill was eliminated. This is (yet another) cautionary tale against goodwill and how it can disappear in the (relative) blink of an eye.Optimism Embedded in PriceThe low level of cash flow to assets is only one half of the equation. Unfortunately, the art of investing involves more than simply finding a profitable company and buying in. Retail investors access the future cash flows of a given company by purchasing shares that trade in the public market. The price movements that the shares experience in the short run have less to do with the fortunes of the company and much more to do with the overall mood of the market. In our view, when the market is in a good mood, that's bad for the rest of us. The corollary may be (but not necessarily) true. When the market is pessimistic, it may be a good time to invest. When the market is optimistic, it's almost always a bad time to invest.The reason we don't like investing when the market is in a particularly optimistic mood is because those situations represent the worst of all possible worlds for marginal investors. If a given company achieves the optimistic assumptions embedded in price, the shares may not move much, as great expectations are already priced in. If, as is more likely, the world doesn't work out perfectly, there's a very high degree of probability that the market will take the shares down quickly and dramatically. We've seen a few examples of this recently with our bearish calls. You're welcome. Don't call us heroes. It's what we do.Anyway, one of the ways we use to gauge the mood of the market at the moment is to compare the simple TTM (trailing twelve month) PE multiple to the forward PE multiple. If the forward is ""too low"" relative to the current, that may be a sign that the market is too optimistic about the future prospects of a given company.At the moment, Stewart's shares are (richly) priced with a PE of 324.1 and a forward PE of ~20.1. Thus, holding all else equal, the market is forecasting earnings to grow at about 1,500% over the next year. We consider this to be a very optimistic assessment of the company's likely future, especially in light of the actual earnings history at the firm.Source: GurufocusConclusionStewart represents a poor combination of low operating returns and an expensive price. For those reasons alone, we recommend investors avoid the name. The kicker is the fact that the company has destroyed shareholder value with an acquisition and that destruction has finally become apparent in the financial statements."
3980783,87816,2016-06-08T13:36:09-04:00,Poised to improve earnings with the next real property boom.Activist Investor intervention.Company may be for sale.Special situation in a company & industry otherwise only occasionally interesting.,"Stewart Information Services Corporation (STC) is the holding company formed by the Morris and Stewart families in the 1970s to house their old-line land title insurance underwriter Stewart Title Guaranty Company, and their direct title insurance agency and escrow closing operations. The company began as an attorney's abstract business in Galveston County, Texas, just before the great storm of 1900. The families inherited their shares from founders/early managers William H. Stewart and W. C. Morris. In 1975 the Morris family acquired the remaining interest of the Stewart family, and under the leadership of brothers W. C. Morris, Jr., and Stewart Morris, and their sons Malcolm Morris and Stewart Morris, Jr., grew the company into the billion dollar highly rated underwriter and international title company that it has become. Today STC is run by Mathew Morris, great-grandson of W. C. Morris, Sr.Data for this report was gathered from STC's (SEC) filings and STC's annual report archive on their web page, and from both Yahoo and Morningstar (access to Morningstar is proprietary).Profitability.The land title insurance business, which constitutes over 90% of STC's business activity by revenue, is difficult to forecast as revenues (title insurance premiums) depend on the sales prices of real property transactions and the level of real estate activity. Rates per thousand dollars of insurance coverage vary from state to state, and may be promulgated (set and announced) by state insurance commissions, or filed with the states by the various underwriters in a given jurisdiction. The level of real estate activity depends in part on the availability and cost of funds used to finance purchases, consumer sentiment, general business activity, and so on. Roughly half of STC's revenue is comprised of the gross premium written by independent agents, who retain about 81% to 83% of the premium. Another 41% of STC's revenue is generated by owned agencies, so STC retains both the underwriter's share and the agent's share of the premium.The American Land Title Association (ALTA) estimates STC is the fourth largest, with a 12% market share, but the measure is based on title insurance premium reported by underwriters. Contractual differences between underwriters and the agents who issue their policies, differences among underwriting reporting practices from state to state, and local differences in how and by whom real estate sales transactions are closed make the measure only a rough estimate.STC's direct premium, which constitutes about 41% of STC revenue, is highly correlated (coefficient of correlation .914, coefficient of determination .835) with an index of US home sales. The index is constructed as the sum of new houses sold reported by the US Bureau of the Census, and a report of existing home sales from the National Association of Realtors, over the eight years ending 2015. Difficulties in forecasting demand for housing, interest rates, money supply and availability of mortgage lending funds, and so on, make the correlation of little use as a forecasting tool, but it clearly demonstrates both the source and the variability of STC's revenues.The foregoing sets an explanatory predicate to understanding STC's profitability. In the three or four years immediately following the bursting of the housing bubble, FNMA reported annual mortgage lending dropped to $1.2 to $1.5 trillion for 2008 through 2012, from annual highs in the vicinity of $2.3 to $2.5 trillion for 2003 through 2006. This is a drop in lending activity of something like 40% to 45%. In the good years of 2003 through 2005, STC reported earnings on sales of 4.3%, asset turnover of 1.6 times, return on invested capital (DuPont ROI) of 6.7%, and return on shareholders' equity of 14.7%. In the more recent good years of 2012 through 2013, STC reported return on sales of 4.5%, turnover of 1.5 times, ROI of 6.8% and return on shareholders' equity of 14.4%. In the years from 2007 through 2010, STC lost money.Activist shareholders.Cursory review of SEC filings indicates that in 2012, 2013, and 2014 STC experienced significant changes in interest from institutional investors. Today the common stock is over 90% owned by over 140 funds and institutional investors. Besides big holders Dimensional Fund Advisors, BlackRock Advisors, and Foundation Asset Management, owners include or have included activist and other investors representing Bulldog Investors, Engine Capital, Ancora Advisers, and others. Bulldog Investors and Engine Capital are generally known as activist investors. In May of 2014 STC added Arnaud Ajdler and Glenn Christenson to the board. Ajdler is a managing partner and apparent majority owner of Engine Capital. Christenson is a principal/owner of Velstand LLC, a commercial real estate advisor. Engine Capital and Foundation Asset Management sought changes at STC in 2014, and agreed not to solicit proxies in 2014, in return for STC's election of Christenson and Ajdler. STC reached agreement with Bulldog early in 2015, under which STC agreed to the election of James Chadwick. Chadwick is a director and manager at Ancora Advisers, and has experience with other activist investors. Ancora holds out as a family wealth investment advisor. Together, Christensen, Ajdler, Chadwick and associated firms/funds Engine Capital, Ancora Advisers, Foundation Asset Management, Bulldog Investors, et al., own roughly 6% to 8% of STC outstanding stock.As a result from pressures by the activist interests, STC has changed their long standing anti-takeover dual stock strategy, in which lineal descendants of the founder W. H. Stewart controlled the board. Under the new plan, the controlling shareholders have exchanged the old class B common, owned by the family members, for class A ordinary common, plus a $12 million payment. The result is a single class of common stock with no extraordinary rights, and of which the Morris family and other STC employees aggregate less than 5%.In various press releases STC and activist owners indicated they believed more aggressive management could initially save $25 million in operating costs annually, and eventually unlock great untapped potential and significantly improved results.Competitors & stock prices.The industry group used by most reporting services (e.g. Yahoo! Finance) includes general casualty lines with title insurance. Title insurance is fundamentally different from other forms of insurance, in that a title policy indemnifies the insured against specific losses based on defects in the title to real property, up to the date of the policy. In other words, title insurance is about events that have already happened, whereas general casualty insurance indemnifies against loss from events that may occur in the future.STC's main competitors are Fidelity National Financial (FNF), Old Republic Insurance (ORI), and First American Financial (FAF). According to the ALTA FNF has 33% of the market, FAF has 27%, ORI 15%, and STC 12%.FNF, ORI, and FAF post return on sales, ROI and return on equity measures that are comparable to STC's, although STC's asset turnover is substantially better than the competitors. The comparisons are not completely apples to apples, as each of the four run businesses other than title insurance. FNF, for instance, owns several restaurant chains, and sells real estate information and mortgage services in addition to title insurance and escrow services. FAF and ORI both engage in general casualty lines as well as title insurance, and STC has significant interests in real estate information and mortgage services. Competitors' recent P/E ratios are 14 for FAF, 12 for ORI, and 19 for FNF.In the worst of the recession immediately before and after the US housing bubble debacle, STC traded in a range between $8 and $10. Agreements to stop activist proxy fights were reached in 2014 and 2015, and the stock recovered to a range between $35 and $39, probably due to increases in institutional interest. The 52-week high is $44, and the stock is trading at $38 to $39 on June 6, 2016. STC posted an $11 million loss for the first quarter of 2016, after losing about $6 million for all of 2015. If they can return to the days of earning $5 or $6 per share (2004, 2004, 2005, 2012 EPS were $6.93, $4.86, $4.89, and $5.66 respectively) with a conservative P/E of 15 times earnings, the stock could sell in the range of $75 to $90.Prognostication.The US economy continues to muddle through. Growth in gross domestic product remains close to flat, and inflation continues below the Fed target of 2.0%. Existing home sales are up one month, then flat or down the next. The new home construction outlook continues to improve, but results disappoint. Some months are good, some are poor. Money rates, including mortgage rates, continue at or near historic lows. Some say we are at or near full employment, while concerns about the participation rate continue. In recent remarks, Federal Reserve Chair Yellen indicated the outlook for housing and new construction calls for continued optimism for gradual expansion. After several years of false starts since the recession following the housing bubble, both the new housing and resale housing market appear to be poised for recovery as the overall economy gradually improves. Having survived the hard times, most title companies are lean and poised for the coming recovery in new construction sales, resales, and housing prices, and mortgage loans are available to qualified borrowers at historically low rates.STC is poised to enjoy increasing stock prices with continued improvements in profitability, and is being prepared to be sold. With activist investors on its board, recent charter and bylaw changes eliminating their anti-takeover protections, and improving real estate activity, patient investors should accumulate STC on weakness, or perhaps write cash-covered puts below the market. The current economic doldrums may be the lull that precedes improvement in the industry and in STC in particular. For the more short-term oriented, options are available, but they are few, and thinly traded. The activists may have the key to unlock the value in STC."
3020876,41741,2015-03-23T10:43:11-04:00,"This title insurer now has three activist funds complaining about its dual class structure.
        There’s even talk of a buyout.
        But if it doesn’t come, how likely is it for activists to shakeup one of the most unfriendly shareholder structures in the market?.","With just a $1bn market cap, the title insurance company, Stewart Information Services (NYSE:STC), is being facing a myriad of activist pressure. The latest includes Bulldog Investors, which owns just over 5% of the company and has nominated five directors for the broad.Note that last year Engine Capital and Foundation Asset Management got involved with Stewart as activist investors. They ended up settling with Stewart Information and getting the company to put two of its nominees on the board. Engine and Foundation own right at 8.5% of the company.Part of the reason for all the activist upheaval is the dual class structure of Stewart. Activists want this abolished. But Bulldog also wants a sale of the company.Foundation sent a letter to the board last week agreeing with Bulldog that the board needs to be held accountable and the dual-class structure removed.In addition to Bulldog, Foundation has also been calling for a Stewart buyout for some time, noting that there are various companies willing to buy the company at what it calls a significant premium to the current stock price.Shares are at 52-week highs, and it's been a heck of a ride over the last decade.Bulldog Investors usually takes activist stakes in closed-end funds, but does have experience taking on insurance and real estate companies. As far as Engine Capital, it's recent activist campaigns include Carbonite (NASDAQ:CARB), Speed Commerce (SPDC) and Ann (NYSE:ANN).Dual class share issue: The key with Stewart, and other companies with a dual class structure, is that they have historically been tough to shake up, which is the whole reason for the dual class -- keeping the majority of the voting power in a small number of shareholders' hands.At Stewart, Class B shareholders own 5% of the company, but have enough of the shareholder vote to elect four of the nine directors. Specifically, the company has roughly 22mm ordinary shares outstanding, with just around 1 million in Class B shares. The majority of Class B shares are held by the Morris family, with Matthew Morris as CEO.What's more is that the Class B shareholders aren't entitled to dividends, leading to an inherent conflict of interest. But in the bylaws, it only takes the vote of six directors to pass a board vote. So Bulldog and the other activists would have to sway just one of the Class B elected directors. And given the fact that many institutional shareholders oppose dual class shares structures, Bulldog might be able to pull off a coup d'état of sorts. The number of companies with two classes of stock in the S&P 500 is only about 8%.The other issues: Stewart has been orchestrating a turnaround for three years now. As part of the agreement with Foundation and Engine, it agreed to cut $25mm in costs. But profit margins are down from 6.5% a couple years ago to 1.6%, and with it, earnings per share has gone from over $5 to just over $1.Foundation Asset also dug deep to figure out just how lopsided things are at Stewart . From 2001 to 2013 the Morris family received payments of $40.8mm, while it simultaneously raised $37.5mm from public shareholders.If you look at the corporate governance for some 2,300 companies in the U.S. with a market cap greater than $500mm, there's only 110, or roughly 4%, with dual share classes. And of those 110, Stewart gives insiders the most control with the lowest economic stake in the company.The company is trying to fend off activists, last month noting that it would up its dividend from 10 cents a share to $1. Recall that the dividend has been kept so low for so long because Class B shareholders aren't entitled to dividends. The stock is now up 12% on the year after the announcement, plus more talk of a buyout. Bulldog has said that buyers from different industries, including the real estate and private equity sectors, would be willing to pay upwards of $50 a share -- 20% upside from current levels.Where we stand: It won't be an easy battle, even with three activists involved -- at least when it comes to getting the company to do away with its dual class structure. Recall that Mario Gabelli has been battling Telephone and Data Systems (NYSE:TDS) since 2009 over its dual class of shares. Now there is the potential buyout, but from a historical perspective, and even from a relative one (compared to peers), Stewart doesn't appear all that cheap."
4004444,102176,2016-09-06T16:17:09-04:00,"A drawn-out battle between Stewart Information Services management and activist funds is near its end.Current stock price trades close to Starboard's entry price.Despite mismanagement,underlying business is very desirable to potential buyers.","Three activist funds hold significant stake in Stewart Information Services. (NYSE:STC) In this article, I explain why activists are targeting this company, how much value activists think they can realize by changing the structure of the company, and what all this means for other shareholders or potential shareholders of the company.What went wrong with Stewart?Stewart is the No. 3 title insurance provider in the U.S. However, its profit margin persistently and significantly lags behind its competitors due to its bloated expenses. Activist Foundation Asset Management's presentation showed that while the company has only a meager 4.4% pre-tax operating margin, its main competitors First American Financial (NYSE:FAF), Fidelity National Financial (NYSE:FNF), and Old Republic International (NYSE:ORI) have operating margins of 11.5%, 9.2%, and 8.0%, respectively. Despite management's promise to improve profitability, the earning results have not met investors' expectation.One major factor behind the company's underperformance is the current management itself. Previously, the company had a dual class stock structure that essentially gave control of the company to the Morris family who held the class B shares because the class B shareholders can elect 4 out of 9 board members and the company bylaw dictated that any board action required 6 votes out of the 9 members. Without class B shareholder's consent, any corporate action wouldn't be able to gather the required 6 votes. To make matter worse, the CEO is also a member of the Morris family. Under the protection of the class B shares' power, the CEO could underperform without being held responsible and surely they did.Before the activists' campaign, this 2013 shareholders' annual meeting filing showed a perfect example of bloated expenses: "" For many decades, the Company has maintained and utilized a collection of antique and replica carriages for business promotion and customer entertainment purposes."" The horses are owned by the Morris family but "" the Company was responsible for the labor, maintenance, housing and operating costs of these assets(carriages)."" Well, I've seen shareholders pick up the bills for private jets but here we are talking about carriages and horses! This is probably one of the most outrageous examples I've ever read.How much value could the company be worth?Stewart's title insurance business essentially sells a warranty that the title of a house is free of defects when lenders make a loan, including securitization. The title insurer takes a one-time fee calculated based on the transaction price and guarantees lenders' lien priority. If for any reason lenders' lien positions were compromised, the insurer will have to pay for the lenders' losses. The American Land Title Association has a very comprehensive collection of data about this industry and this excel file from its website showed market share information dated all the way back to 1989. According to their data, the whole industry's revenue grew consistently from 3.5 billion in 1989 to 13.2 billion in 2015. Market share of the big 4 — Fidelity, First American, Stewart, and Old Republic — was over 96% in 1989 and gradually declined to 87% as of 2015. But the decline was mainly at the expense of the largest player Fidelity. First American, Stewart, and Old Republic all significantly expanded their share over this period. Stewart, specifically, grew its market share from 7.3% in 1989 to 14.8% in 2015.These data make it clear why Stewart is valuable. First of all, the industry is growing because of the housing market. America's population is still growing at a very healthy rate which translates into mores houses and higher housing prices, a trend in turn means higher title insurance volume and higher title insurance premium. Moreover, Stewart is the last stand-alone title insurance franchise and is based in Texas, a state which is among the fastest growing states. Second, the industry dynamics looks very stable and it doesn't seem that any disrupting force is coming anytime soon. For any spirited disrupters, chances are they haven't even heard of title insurance.So this is why Stewart is very appealing for either companies that want to enter this market or rival companies that want to expand its market share. If Stewart is in the hands of better management, this would be a terrific company. The easiest way for improvement, proposed by one of the activists Foundation Asset Management in their presentation to the board, is an outright sell to its rival companies or a private equity firm. Foundation Asset Management estimates that Fidelity or First American can improve the company's margin to north of 10% and pay a fair price of $60/share for Stewart. In the other scenario that the company is acquired by Old Republic or a PE firm, the margin would be a bit lower and the acquirer should be comfortable buying Stewart's shares at $55/share. I feel their margin assumptions under various scenarios are very achievable because again if there was cost associated with horses there is probably a lot of low-hanging fruit in cost improvement.And just for analysis' sake, let's back off and think about the unlikely but possible scenario in which no company is willing to take Stewart. If activists can simply replace the management and achieve an 8% pre-tax margin, a margin that is the lowest generated among its peers, as a stand-alone company Stewart would have a net income of 112 million dollars, based on Stewart's TTM revenue of around 2 billion and a 35% tax rate. As of Sep 02,2016, the company has a market cap of 1.1 billion so a 112 million net income would put the P/E ratio at right around 10 times. Old Republic, the company with an 8% pre-tax margin and the lowest P/E among Stewart's 3 competitors, has currently a P/E ratio of 12.6. But as Foundation pointed out earlier in their presentation, compared to Old Republic, Stewart actually has a better revenue mix between its direct and agency channels (agency charges commission and hence generates lower margin for the company) so it's quite possible for Stewart to achieve a pre-tax margin above 8%.History of activists' campaign against the Morris familyIf the chance of improving the company's results is relatively high as we discussed, the key question is whether activists can gain control of the company and effect a change. I will briefly list key events happened so far from the fights between activists and the Morris family. (All information related to Foundation's involvement mentioned below is referenced from their recent letter to the board dated July 28th,2016. )What does this all mean for other common shareholders?From the above brief history, it's clear to see that things are gradually falling into pieces and activists are very close to claiming the ultimate victory. And that is a good thing for every other shareholder. Let me explain.According to the latest filings, Foundation owns 5.6% of total Stewart shares and Bulldog Investors owns another 4.85% on top of Starboard's 9.9%. So the 3 activists altogether own around 20.5% of the total stock. They just need a mere 4.5% percent vote from other shareholders to call the special meeting. The voting results in 2015 and 2016 showed that proposals related to corporate governance improvement mentioned above gathered over 95% of votes. The past voting results firmly indicate that common shareholders like the activists' ideas and no one is on the management's side. Therefore, the occurrence of shareholders' special meeting and the replacement of the Morris members are very high probability events.Then what happens? Once the board members shuffle, we will have 7 common shareholders elected directors on the 9-member board. What's even more important is that 4 directors are nominated by Foundation and 1 director by Bulldog. Since any decision of the board now only requires a simple majority, with at least 5 members on their side, the activists can easily push for a sale of the company. Also these 2 nominees might be very instrumental in the eventual sale of the company down the road: one nominee Earnest Smith held various positions including Co-Chief Operating Officer of Fidelity National, Stewart's biggest competitor and the other nominee Roslyn Payne served on the board of First American, Stewart's second biggest competitor. We can easily see where this is going if the two nominees are elected.And this is just Foundation's plan for Stewart. We do not know at this point if Starboard has any plan of its own for the company. But even if the prominent Starboard simply tag along and vote with the other activists, we will very likely see some favorable voting results for all shareholders out of the special meeting in the near future.SummaryThis is an uncommon situation in which average investors can buy a stock at a level close to a famous activist's entry point (the 13D showed that Starboard's entry price is around $43.3/share, about 7.4% less than current price). The underlying business is very stable and desirable. The activists have a very high chance of succeeding and a sale of the company could happen as early as sometime next year. The lowest estimated sale price $55/share would generate a return of around 20% within a relatively short holding period. This is not a stock that will produce a ten bagger but the risk/reward is still quite favorable."
4014299,102176,2016-10-24T14:19:59-04:00,The settlement with Starboard is bullish news for the stock.Investment thesis remains intact.Director nominations and 2017 annual meeting could serve as catalysts in the near future.,"Since my last piece ""Event-Driven Stock With 20%+ Upside And A Relatively Short Holding Period"", there has been some major new development on Stewart Information Services (NYSE:STC), namely the management's settlement with activist Starboard. In this article, I am going to explain details of the settlement and its implications for shareholders.Starboard Standstill Agreement reached on Oct. 17th (read the entire agreement here)1). Two directors affiliated with management steps down. Malcolm Morris and Stewart Morris from the Morris camp are no longer on the board. Instead, CEO Mathew Morris becomes the new board member.2). One Starboard designee joins the board. The Starboard designee Clifford Press, according to the announcement, is ""an experienced governance oriented investor, and has served on the Boards of numerous public companies in the course of his career."" He is Managing Member of Olive Press Partners and a veteran on activism. He is currently on the board of Quantum Corporation after Quantum's settled with Starboard and the board of Newcastle Investment after Newcastle's settlement with BLR Partners.3). The board will be kept at the current size of 9 members.4). The search for two new independent directors begins.5). Starboard will vote in favor of the Board Slate in 2017 shareholder meeting.6). Starboard will not present any new business proposal or new director nominee before the 2017 meeting.7). Standstill agreement will last over one year, based on estimated 2017 annual meeting date. The agreement lasts until the earlier of: a) the date that is 15 business days prior to the deadline for the submission of stockholder nominations for the Company's 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, and b) the date that is 130 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2017 Annual Meeting. However, the agreement could end prematurely if within 110 days no new directors are appointed due to regulatory issues.What does this settlement mean for common shareholders?It shows that activists clearly have the upper hand. The agreement clearly favors Starboard. It is also good to see that the three different activists are able to collaborate. Foundation, another activist fund who owns the stock, had its own agenda and was the main activist in this fight. However, after Starboard's involvement in Stewart, Foundation called off the special meeting and gave Starboard the lead activist role.Activists and shareholders got close to what they wanted without paying for the expense of a special meeting. The special meeting, as I discussed in my previous article, called for the exit of the two Morris directors and the election of two Foundation's nominees. After this settlement, without going through the special meeting which could cost a few millions, only one director from the Morris family and one Morris ally Thomas Apel remain on the board. One experienced Starboard designee gets on the board and two more independent directors are set to join in 2017. After the 2017 shareholder meeting, we will have 7 independent directors on the 9-person board.Two upcoming directors will represent activists. Based on agreement item 4 explained above, it is easy to see that activists will have the say on the new 2017 director selection process. First, the Nominating Committee consists of the Starboard director, the Bulldog director, and one Morris ally. Activists' pick is very likely to pass the initial nomination vote because the rule says the candidate only needs majority of the votes (2 out of 3). Next, when the board votes, there are at least 4 activist friendly votes from the two Foundation directors, one Bulldog director, and one Starboard director. That means the candidate needs one more vote from the remaining three directors. How Robert Clarke, the other independent director, votes is less unclear. However, even in the worst scenario that activists' candidate cannot pass the board vote, the standstill agreement gives Starboard the final say on the director nominee. Therefore, there is no way that the activists will lose in this selection process regardless of how Morris, Apel, and Clark vote.Good things should come out after the 2017 election. Since we will have 6 directors nominated aligned with activists on board after the 2017 election and any corporate action only requires a simple majority (5 votes out of 9), it will be easy for the activists to push through any major changes, including sale of the company. We should expect material news regarding the direction of the company after the 2017 annual meeting.SummaryThe investment thesis in my previous article remains intact and this settlement is good news for the stock. Based on Stewart's quarterly earnings that was out two days after the settlement news, business fundamentals of the company have not changed since my last article. Starboard has shown its hand and cleared some uncertainty on how the campaign would unfold with three activists fund all in the same stock. Although Foundation has accomplished a great deal against the Morris family, Starboard, because of its reputation and track record, is probably the preferred activist for this stock in the eyes of common shareholders. Starboard's cost basis is around $43/share, only about 4% below the Oct 22 closing price. The target price remains at $55-60/share, implying a 20%-30% upside. In the next two to three months, director nominations will come out, serving as a catalyst that might prop the stock in the near term. However, the major catalyst will probably come after the 2017 election. If the 2017 annual meeting takes place around the same time as the 2016 meeting, we should see something big in 6 months after April 2017."
1327581,32101,2013-04-09T13:48:06-04:00,,"Stewart Information Services (NYSE:STC) has been in the title insurance business since 1893. Title insurance includes the functions of searching, examining, closing and insuring the condition of the title to real property. Its purpose is to ascertain ownership of property being transferred and to discover whether there are other claims to the property through such things as deeds, mortgages, wills, divorce decrees, court judgments, liens, paging assessments and tax records.In short, we are talking about an instrumental service which is tied directly to the recovering mortgage market. Stewart Information Services is of interest to us because of the possible leveraged nature of the returns to be expected during a recovery of the mortgage market. In fact, last year we began to see the large surpluses which can accrued to the company if we are indeed facing a recovery. With a current market capitalization of $531m and net income for 2012 of $119m we are looking at a security yielding 22% or a PE of 4.46. If the housing recovery is true -- which it likely is -- then we are looking at a company which could theoretically produce large returns for intelligent investors.Operating HistoryObviously, STC took a hit during the mortgage crisis. Below are revenues, expenses, and net income across the past ten years:Because of how this graph is drawn it is hard to get a picture of where the TTM net income falls when compared to its history. Take a look at net income by itself:As one might note, the most recent numbers are similar to the sort of figures which were posted during the mortgage bubble and therefore are likely to be a bit above normal earning power. This judgment might be in error when we look at the size of the corporation's assets when compared to net income:Given the overall change in asset size when compared to earning power, it is possible that the corporation will be posting satisfactory figures in the future. Or rather, last time the corporation had earnings at this level, total assets were significantly smaller and therefore perhaps the most recent earnings are thereby sustainable.Mortgage MarketThe mortgage market is normally considered the same as the housing market and therefore we will continue that assumption here. There are many favorable trends occurring in the housing market. Let us take a look at the relevant figures. First, we have housing starts which, if the house does not already have an owner, will need to be sold and insurance will be assumed on that transaction:Further, existing home sales looks like it bottomed some time last year:Lastly, the NAHB-Wells Fargo Housing Market Index is a perceptual index which tracks survey responses which are to rate the housing market conditions at present and for the next 6 months. The perception of the market is changing:All these things are good for the mortgage market. Further, home ownership hit a record low last year according to Gallup which also suggests that the time might be ripe for a recovery.ValuationWith tangible book of about $353m, compared to the market price of $538m, we only are able to rely on the balance sheet as a back stop in extreme situations. However the earnings which were solidly demonstrated in the most recent period combined with the historical increase in assets suggest that the earning power for this corporation is likely closer to last year's results than the weaker results of 2011. Further, data out of the housing market is pretty optimistic. However, the earnings record of the corporation is hardly steady and therefore we are forced into rough estimates and assumptions.If we assume that the most recent earnings figure of $119m is too great and if we therefore cut out estimate by 60%, we are left with earnings of about $71.4m. Capitalized at 11%, such an annuity stream would be worth about $646 or a premium of 20% over the current market price. Of course if earnings going forward are 45% of 2012's earnings -- or $53.8m discounted at 10% -- then we are looking at a fairly valued security.Therefore if earnings are higher than $53.8m going forward, a viable argument can be made for Steward Information Services stock. Further, I believe the environment in which this corporation works is improving significantly. In fiscal 2005, the corporation had net income of approximately $88m. That year, existing home sales were greater than 6 million units in the United States. In fiscal 2012, the corporation had net income of approximately $119m in a year where existing homes sales were less than 5 million. At the same time, however, the profit margin for 2012 was greater than at any time in the last 10 years and therefore can be criticized as unsustainable. Check out the corporations historical profit margin:Keep in mind that the corporation has reduced its expenses and therefore some of the recent gains in profit margin could be theoretically recurring. But it would be wise, when attempting to estimate future earning power, to use a historical average. If we assume the losses due to the mortgage crisis are normal, then the average profit margin over the last ten years is about 1.2%. Of course, I think those losses are highly irregular and unlikely to recur anytime soon. Ignoring years in which losses were incurred, we have a profit margin of 3.7%. Applying that profit margin to the recent revenue figures of $1910m, we get approximately $70m in estimated earning power. Such earning power makes the corporation undervalued by some 20%.For reasons which should be obvious, such estimates are quite rough and hardly to be counted upon, but I think it is probable that the corporation will continue to have success as the housing market recovers. Further, assuming a fairly conservative estimate of 3.7% profit margin, the corporation is still attractively priced.Therefore, with a generally positive outlook for this corporation and adjusted for the possibility of abnormal profitability, this stock could still have some legs. In sum, there appears to be a good risk/reward outlook. Substantial declines seem highly unlikely and the possibility of abnormal profitability as the housing market rationalizes seems possible.ConclusionThe earning power of this corporation has had its swings and with the large holes in the earnings record from the mortgage crisis, our estimate is unfortunately on rocky grounds. But while the first half of the exhibit period examined above was abnormal due to the then-current optimistic beliefs about housing prices, the latter half of the period is one of abnormal pessimism. Due to this, it is possible that the most recent earnings are more representative of what we will see going forward since Stewart Information Services rationalized its expenses during the recent decline.With the increasingly good signs coming out of the housing market and the earning power demonstrated last year, it is probable that Stewart Information Services will sell at a greater market capitalization in the future which, of course, means the shares will likely command a higher price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

3985282,52922,2016-07-01T05:00:00-04:00,"Stewart is dramatically undervalued at ~$39 per share versus our base case valuation of ~$55 per share. This is based upon the company’s cash flow and private market transactions.Significant corporate governance changes mostly gone unnoticed by the market.After 2+ years of involvement, activists are well positioned to push for a sale of the company.Stewart would garner interest from multiple strategics who could potentially realize $100M to $200M in synergies.Stewart has a bloated cost structure with pre-tax margins half that of its peers, masking the true earnings power of the business.","Stewart Information Services (NYSE:STC) (""Stewart"", ""STC"", or the Company"") represents a compelling event-driven investment opportunity at a steep discount to our estimate of intrinsic value of $55 to $60 per share, representing more than 40% upside.Founded in 1893 by Maco Stewart in Galveston Texas, Stewart is the 4th largest residential title insurer with 12.2% market share in the United States and is the 3rd largest provider of commercial title insurance behind Fidelity National (NYSE:FNF) and First American Financial (NYSE:FAF).Stewart's main underwriting subsidiary is Stewart Title Guaranty Company (""STG"") which files with the Texas insurance commissioner. As of 12/31/15, this entity had $502M of statutory surplus (equity) and underwrote $1.3B of premiums.While historically perceived by the street as an under-managed, family-controlled entity, today Stewart offers a highly attractive risk-reward profile due to recent events ignored by the street. Over the past two years, multiple activists have taken aim looking to effectuate change due to poor price performance and a massively bloated cost structure relative to peers.Notably the set-up has been de-risked. At the end of April, shareholders approved the elimination of the burdensome dual-class structure, with the Morris family receiving $14M in cash consideration in return for relinquishing their super-voting control. This was likely due to pressure placed on the Company by outside shareholders, notably Bulldog Investors. Large shareholder Foundation Capital followed up on June 2016 in an amended 13D filing requesting the board to implement strategic alternatives and sell the Company. Moreover, the activists also highlighted the significant cost savings opportunities and synergies available to a strategic acquirer.These material changes have gone mostly unrecognized by the market, creating an attractive opportunity with a clear line of sight for value creation. Importantly, an investment in Stewart offers multiple avenues to getting paid, ranging from a strategic alternatives announcement and sale of the business or margin expansion through additional cost cuts and process streamlining. With three activists involved (Bulldog, Foundation Capital and Engine Capital), the probability of change implemented is high.A long position in Stewart is merited by the following:Attractive Valuation: STC trades at an undemanding valuation, at ~7.3x FY15 run-rate pre-tax income, and 5x EBITDA, a steep discount to industry transactions which are generally consummated from 6x to 8x EBITDA. Utilizing a 7.5x multiple on ~$140M of EBITDA leads to a $53 per share price. Please see the ""valuation"" section below for greater color.Significant Cost Saving Opportunities Should Lead to Margin Improvement: Stewart's pre-tax margins significantly lag peers at ~4.4% versus 8%-10% for the industry. This is mainly due to the Company's bloated cost structure and losses from its mortgage delinquency/servicing business. STC has recently shuttered/downsized its delinquency/mortgage operations and has committed to continued cost cuts with the end goal of achieving 10% pre-tax margins. The caveat is that these goals carry no hard time table and are predicated upon ""normalized"" housing transactions (no definition provided). We assume the activists and their appointed board members will hold management accountable towards these goals if the Company is not sold, notably looking for further cost cuts and business streamlining (i.e. centralized locations to process refinances, etc., very similar to peers at FAF and FNF).Per our estimates in the chart above, Stewart currently generates ~$130M in run-rate pre-tax income.Corporate Governance: Stewart recently settled with activist investors, eliminating its dual share class eliminating voting control for the Morris family. In exchange for forgoing voting control, the Morris family received $14M in cash. Even more important, a special meeting may be called if 25% of shareholders request it, allowing for non-family shareholders to swiftly change the board and management team if need be. This could not be accomplished under the former dual-class structure. Recall in the past the unfriendly structure was a deterrent for resource conversion activities such as a sale.Strategics see Significant Value in StewartStewart is a highly attractive asset for larger title insurers or a new entrant given its large direct origination channel. Industry participants have speculated potential synergies which could be realized in a transaction. Some have estimated that an acquisition of STC by FNF/FAF could lead to the removal of $150M to $200M of costs while a sponsor could eliminate ~$100M of overhead. To put this in perspective, STC generated ~$104M of adjusted pre-tax income in FY15. These synergies would likely come from closing duplicative branches and utilizing superior technology platforms which FNF and FAF boast. Said simply, FNF/FAF could simply utilize their current back office infrastructure to handle STC volumes/premiums at higher incremental margins.STC's main entity, Stewart Title Guaranty is relatively unlevered at 2.7x premiums to surplus. An acquirer could underwrite up to 3.5x-4.0x premiums to surplus. Further, an LBO could be consummated through leveraging the HoldCo as seen with FNF during its acquisition of Black Knight. Note title insurers often place debt at the HoldCo/corporate level in order to maintain financial strength, and a favorable AM Best rating at the insurance underwriting subsidiaries (the actual entities which underwrite the title policies). This essentially allows these companies to access capital at attractive terms without placing guaranties of the underlying operating businesses as generally the HoldCo only pledges the stock it holds in the operating entities.Foundation Capital does a great job highlighting the accretive nature of an acquisition of STC by a competitor. On average, a transaction would be 20%-40% accretive to earnings for the acquirer. Please see the link here for greater detail (slides 11 to 14).Attractive Industry: Title insurance is an attractive industry through the cycle with strong returns on capital, cash generation and high barriers to entry due to marketplace know-how and scale.Recall that the title insurance industry is fairly mature with essentially no product differentiation amongst underwriters. Hence, policies are often won through market presence, speed of processing and relationships with lenders and real estate agents. Due to the ""local"" nature of the businesses, market share tends to stay fairly constant from year to year.We believe Stewart is a differentiated and unique asset due to its (1) strong brand name given its 50+ years of existence; (2) large direct business which carries higher margins than agency sourced premiums; (3) title policy mix heavily slated towards purchase policies which carry larger premiums and better margins than refinance premiums (FNF/FAF both have large lower margin refi businesses); and (4) margin uplift and an opportunity to increase its commercial policy market share through the growth of its higher margin commercial business. Moreover, STC is one of the last remaining sizable title insurers which could be purchased by a strategic with the others being Investors Title (NASDAQ:ITIC), Westcor and WFG.Why Does this Opportunity Exist?Street is overlooking Stewart due to the following factors:ValuationOur base case earnings model assumes low growth at ~2% per annum and a gradual ~$30M of cost cuts removed from the Company. As demonstrated below, incremental margins are significant.Base Case P&LPrivate market transactions have historically been consummated at 6x-8x EBITDA and at a multiple of book value. Under a scenario analysis, STC equity is pegged at $53 to $62 per share, roughly in line with our DCF.CatalystsThesis RisksConclusionStewart equity represents an attractive off-the-run investment opportunity with multiple catalysts that should materialize over the next six months. Downside is fairly low considering STC's current cheap valuation, business quality, incentivized shareholders and strategic interests."
276288,24199,2011-06-23T08:32:36-04:00,,"I am a big fan of title insurers. As I discussed in my earlier write-up on Investors Title Company (NASDAQ:ITIC), title insurers receive a single premium up front that insures the policyholder in the event that a property's title is not clear at the time of purchase/mortgage. So, imagine you buy a house and put a mortgage on it, only to find out later that the fellow that sold you the house didn't actually have the right to do so - he owned the house with his estranged wife who is now knocking at your door demanding cash. If you had bought title insurance, you are covered. If not, you are out of luck (though, the bank that put a mortgage on the house forced you to pay for title insurance, as part of their fees). So, you might be asking: Isn’t this an inferior insurance model? Who wants to receive a single payment up front for a liability that may not be uncovered for decades? I like the model for a few reasons. First, the incidence of paying out on these policies is relatively well understood. The vast majority of claims are made within the first six years of the policy. Yes, there is a long-tail of claims, but unlike something like Asbestos, or Japanese earthquakes, the long-tail probability has a low associated cost. This is the distinguishing factor that I think makes title insurance attractive. There will be a small number of claims made many, many years after the policy is taken out, but these claims will be relatively small and in the meantime, the insurer gets to invest that money for its own use. First, how do I know these claims will be relatively small? The bulk of title insurance policies are taken out on behalf of banks who want to be sure the mortgage they are putting on the property will be paid off in the event that the property does not have a clear title. Over time, the property owner pays down this mortgage, which reduces the amount of the potential liability for the title insurer. In the event of a refinancing, or property sale, the liability is extinguished. So, when interest rates are low and homeowners refinance in relatively greater numbers, title insurers (in the aggregate) gain on two accounts: first, their liabilities are extinguished upon sale, and second the new mortgage needs more title insurance, which increases revenues. I’ve written “in the aggregate” here because the new policy may be taken out from a different firm, but in fact the title insurance industry appears to be dominated geographically by one or two firms. For example, as I mentioned in the ITIC write-up, that company essentially controls the North Carolina title insurance market. I should note two other things: First, title insurers set their reserves based on the undiscounted expected liabilities. Ok, enough with the primer on title insurance. You’ve seen why I like the industry, but what about particular companies? In ITIC’s case, investors at the time would essentially have been getting the business for free, as the company could have paid out around 2/3 of its investment portfolio (which approximated the company’s market cap at the time) without jeopardizing its ability to continue to pay claims. This was the result of fifteen years of over-provisioning relative to claims. Since I did that write-up on 3/22, ITIC is up around 28% (as of 6/8/11). Given the run-up, ITIC no longer presents as compelling an opportunity, but I think Stewart Information Services Corporation (NYSE:STC) is in a similar situation as ITIC two months ago. STC is a title insurer that has been in the title business since 1893 with operations in 38 US states, Canada, UK, Mexico, Central America and Australia. The company’s current claims reserve stands at nearly $500 million, which is more than three times its three year average actual claims net of recoveries, which I argue are inflated figures given the leasing shenanigans we’ve seen (the three year average is nearly double the prior five year average). We will see a mean reversion in the claims, and in response to the increased claims, the company increased its reserves accordingly over the last few years (I think this is a good sign of conservative management, as they could have simply run down their reserves and maintained earnings artificially high). In fact, looking back over the last seventeen years of available data in the SEC EDGAR database, we see that STC has made provisions in excess of actual claims for sixteen of those years. These provisions have averaged more than 40% more than actual claims over the period. As I noted in this post, a perhaps better way of looking at the reserves is to consider STC’s reserves relative to last year’s claims and trailing three year claims. Here’s the graph:  (Click charts to enlarge) So, from this perspective, it appears that the company is becoming somewhat less conservative, especially in relation to the late '90s. However, I think the reserves are still quite adequate. So is it cheap? The company’s book value of equity is $433 million ($445m less $13m for noncontrolling interests), or 123% more than the company’s current market cap of $194 million. I believe BV of Equity is a fair approximation of current market value of assets because the company’s assets are highly liquid. Additionally, I think that the liabilities are somewhat overstated (since the company has been overprovisioning for nearly two decades). Should the company be trading at such a discount to NAV? Some discount may be justified since the company has been losing money for a few years. But I argue that those losses are due largely to a rapid increase in provisioning (the title loss expenses increased from an average of 4.9% from 1995 to 2006 to an average of 10.1% from 2007 – 2010). I expect these losses will mean revert given the changes they’ve made to their agency network (more on this below). Additionally, the company has made substantial improvements to its cost structure, reducing headcount, improving technology and transitioning to Regional Production Centers to reduce expenses. This is an ongoing process, but we have already seen significant improvements (see graphs below), which will lead to improved profitability. I argue that in the near term the company should benefit from several things: First, loss provisioning will return to normal levels, which will reduce that expense by ~$80 million. Also, I should note that the company should take a gain this next quarter to reverse the “reserve strengthening” charges they took in relation to a lawsuit it was engaged in with Citigroup (NYSE:C). That lawsuit was resolved this quarter in favour of STC, so that money should flow back as a gain. Second, the company’s real estate information division has been growing like crazy over the last few years and the trend appears to be continuing this year, with revenues this last quarter amounting to nearly 40% of the division’s full 2010 revenues. Though this division is a small part of the company’s overall business, it doesn’t take much to swing EPS given that the company has just 19.4 million shares outstanding. Third, the company has been cutting its employee and other operating costs quite successfully in both divisions, as the following charts show. The company is continuing to transition to Regional Production Centers, which will lead to further improvements in employee expenses.           Fourth, STC has been renegotiating its remittance contracts with the agencies it deals with. This increased remittance rate will flow directly to STC’s bottom line. So far, it has successfully increased remittances in 38 states. Fifth, STC has been increasing its premiums without realizing a concomitant decline in revenues (more evidence of geographic control in the industry). It has raised premiums in 27 states so far. Sixth, the company has improved its agency network. A weak agency network is what led to the massive increase in actual claims over the last few years. Losses on known claims from independent agencies have been reduced from 9.2% a few years ago to 2.9% today, and more than 70% of those claims were from agencies STC has recently stopped working with). For these reasons, I am a fan of STC. If you’ve looked at STC, I’d love to hear your thoughts! Disclosure: I am long STC, ITIC."

I think these customers are ""sticky.""That said, the shares are way too expensive in my estimation. The shares are down double digits from the most recent (congratulatory) earnings call. This should tell us something.That said, I think there are excellent opportunities to be had in the options market. I think the premia are fairly generous at the moment.","The two years since I wrote my bullish piece on Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) has been ""tumultuous"", to put it mildly. After cratering, the shares have risen dramatically in price and are now up about 33.8%, against a gain of 22.8% for the S&P 500. Since much has happened, obviously, I thought I'd look in on the name to see if it's worth hanging on. I'll try to make this determination by looking at the financial history here and by looking at the stock as a thing distinct from the business. The reason that I'm interested in this name now is that it seems to be benefitting from the new work from home trend, and I want to judge whether the crowd is overreacting to that news. If the assumptions embedded in the current price are too optimistic, sooner or later, investors will suffer. In addition, I was exercised on the puts that I recommended, and that deserves commentary also. Although it was emotionally painful being exercised at the strike price, these did help reduce the risk associated with my long position.I'll jump right to the point in case you want the broad strokes of my analysis, and you missed the title of this article as well as the three bullet points, above. I think this is a wonderful business. I think the large number of customers they've been able to attract will be sticky, and so, the earnings growth will likely pick up in future. The problem is with the stock. It's too expensive, and I think investors would be wise to avoid the shares until they come down in price. Alternatively, they can do what I'm going to do and sell some puts on this stock.Before getting into the weeds of the financial statements, it should be noted that this company has grown dramatically recently. Consider the following:The mood is so positive around Stamps.com right now that analysts were actually congratulating the company during the most recent earnings calls. The financial performance here reflects the positive trends, obviously. I've written about the long-term growth rates elsewhere, and in this piece, I think it's most worthwhile if I just focus on the most recent period. I would also normally try to work out whether a given company is in danger of a solvency or credit crisis anytime soon by comparing the size and timing of the cash outflows to the current and likely future resources. I don't think that's a worthwhile exercise in this case because the company currently has total liabilities of just over $227 million against a cash hoard of $275 million. The risk of this company running out of cash anytime soon is vanishingly small in my estimation.The first six months of 2020 have been extraordinarily good, obviously. Specifically, revenue was up just over 30% relative to the same period a year ago, and both service and product were particularly good. In addition, although it only represents a small fraction of sales, customized postage was up about 83% from the year ago period. In addition, the company managed to contain costs fairly well. Specifically, both ""service"" and ""product"" costs were up by only 14.4% and 28.8%, respectively. All of this led to a massive uptick in gross profit. At the same time, ""sales and marketing"", ""R&D"", and ""G&A"" were up by ""only"" 19%, 21%, and 14%, respectively. All of this led to an 87% uptick in income from operations.As I review the financial history here, I find virtually nothing to criticize. It's obvious that Stamps.com is firing on all cylinders. I'd be happy to add to my position at the right price.Source: Company filingsI sometimes worry that I'm being repetitive when I state that the price an investor pays for a stream of future cash flows largely determines their return. When I read some of the comments on this forum, my worries about repeating myself too much disappear. It seems that a large group of people on this site are willing to buy a great business like this one at nearly any price. I think history demonstrates that the price paid really, really matters, and for that reason, I need to look at the stock as a thing distinct from the business.In particular, I want to determine whether the shares are expensive or cheap. I think it's always better to buy cheap because cheaply priced stocks offer both enhanced return potential at lower risk. They're lower risk because any bad news won't be too much of a shock, so when the company hits inevitable soft patches, the price can't drop very much. They offer enhanced returns because of what I call the ""prodigal son effect."" If the market receives good news from a company that we were heretofore convinced was a ""dog"", the shares will pop.My regular readers know that I judge ""cheap"" in a few ways. First and most simply, I compare price to some measure of economic value, like earnings, free cash flow and the like. The more an investor pays for a given stream of future cash flows, the more risky the investment in my estimation.I was initially impressed by the fact that Stamps.com was trading at a price to free cash flow of just under 15 times. At the moment, the shares are about 57% more expensive than they were previously, per the following.Data by YChartsSource: YChartsIn addition to looking at the simple relationship between price and future cash, I want to understand what the market is currently assuming about future growth. In order to do this, I turn to the work published by Professor Stephen Penman in his book ""Accounting for Value."" In this book, Penman walks investors through how they can isolate the ""g"" (growth) variable in a standard finance formula to work out what the market must be assuming about a given company's future. According to this methodology, the market seems to be assuming something like a 9.5 % long-term (i.e. perpetual) growth rate for this company. I consider that to be a very optimistic forecast, and for that reason, I must recommend avoiding the shares at current levels.I obviously like this company a great deal, and I think it's an excellent investment at the right price. It just so happens that the crowd has gotten ahead of itself and has bid the shares to excessive levels in my view. This puts me on the horns of a dilemma. I can sit around and wait for shares to drop to a more reasonable price (BORING!), or I can generate a credit in my account by selling some short puts on this name.I should point out that my own experience here indicates that short puts can serve to both enhance returns while lowering risk. I initially purchased some shares at just under $200 and wrote puts that I was exercised on. The net price of the shares that I acquired by being put to me was ~$167. So, I've earned a 33% total return on the shares I purchased initially and a 59% return on the shares I acquired after being put to me. It's obviously the case that the shares may not have recovered, but even in that circumstance, the shares acquired by being exercised would have done ""less bad"" than the shares I bought initially.I consider short puts to be a ""win-win"" trade at the moment because the investor benefits whatever the outcome. If the shares remain above the strike price, the investor simply pockets the premium, which is never a bad thing. If the shares drop below the strike price, the investor will be obliged to buy, but will do so at a price that they determined to be acceptable while in a cold and rational state.I think there's another advantage to short put options that relates to why investors so rarely ""buy low"" in periods of maximal fear. I think the phrase ""buy low"" is one of the most vacuous things ever uttered by a human. I think it's a silly expression because it blithely assumes that it's possible to rationally simply buy when others are fearfully selling. The only time that stocks go on sale is when there are extremely compelling reasons to avoid shares completely. This is why so many investors miss rallies. They talk themselves out of buying at the perfect time because the world is particularly scary. Short put options offer a sort of Ulysses pact the forces the investor to buy when they may be uncomfortable doing so. I can say from first-hand experience that it can be quite uncomfortable being exercised, but it's always worked out well for me over time because I insisted on not overpaying.At the moment, my preferred trade is the Stamps.com May put with a strike of $180. These are currently bid-asked at $21.30-$25.40. If the investor simply takes the bid on these, and they are subsequently exercised, they'll be obliged to buy but will do so at a net price ~40% below the current level. If the shares remain above $180, obviously, the investor simply pockets the premium, which is never a bad thing. I consider either of these outcomes acceptable, hence ""win-win.""Now that you're hopefully intrigued by the ""win-win"" character of short puts, dear reader, it's time for me to absolutely obliterate the positive vibes by writing about risk. The nature of the world is such that we must choose between a host of imperfect trade-offs, as there's no ""risk-free"" option. Short puts are no different. We do our best to navigate the world by exchanging one pair of risk-reward trade-offs for another. For example, holding cash presents the risk of erosion of purchasing power via inflation and the reward of preserving capital at times of extreme volatility. The risks of share ownership should be obvious to readers on this forum.I think the risks of put options are very similar to those associated with a long stock position, actually. If the shares drop in price, the stockholder loses money, and the short put writer may be obliged to buy the stock. Thus, both long stock and short put investors typically want to see higher stock prices.Puts are distinct from stocks in that some put writers don't want to actually buy the stock - they simply want to collect premia. Such investors care more about maximizing their income and will, therefore, be less discriminating about which stock they sell puts on. These people don't want to own the underlying security. I like my sleep far too much to play short puts in this way. I'm only willing to sell puts on companies I'm willing to buy at prices I'm willing to pay. For that reason, being exercised isn't the hardship for me that it might be for many other put writers. My advice is that, if you are considering this strategy yourself, you would be wise to only ever write puts on companies you'd be happy to own.In my view, put writers take on risk, but they take on less risk (sometimes significantly less risk) than stock buyers in a critical way. Short put writers generate income simply for taking on the obligation to buy a business that they like at a price that they find attractive. This circumstance is objectively better than simply taking the prevailing market price. This is why I consider the risks of selling puts on a given day to be far lower than the risks associated with simply buying the stock on that day.I'll conclude this rather long discussion of risks by indulging my tendency toward tedious repetition, and I'll use the trade I'm currently recommending as an example. An investor can choose to buy Stamps.com today at a price of ~$266. Alternatively, they can generate a credit for their accounts immediately by selling put options that oblige them - under the worst possible circumstance - to buy the shares at a net price about 40% below today's level. Buying the same asset at that massive a discount is the definition of lower risk in my view.There's much to like about Stamps.com. The company is an obvious beneficiary of the new way of doing business. More importantly, it's very likely that they will maintain these customers long after the world returns to something like normal. I also really like the fact that this company's capital structure is very solid.That said, investors buy stocks, and stocks are driven by the crowd. The crowd can be either manic or despondent, and it's never a good idea to buy when the market is manic. I think it's worth remembering the optimism on display during the most conference call. The analysts were obviously buoyant and were congratulating Stamps.com for an impressive result. The shares are down about 14.4% since then. This suggests that buying when optimism is high is not a good strategy. I think there's a great deal of optimism still embedded in price, and so, I can't recommend buying the shares at the moment.That said, I think there's still a great opportunity to be had by selling the puts described above. The premia are quite generous, and under the ""worst"" possible scenario, the investor will buy this wonderful business at a staggeringly good discount. So, to sum up, shares no, short puts yes."

These advancements benefit both consumers trapped at home and the businesses no longer seeing foot traffic in their stores. Yet the end product still needs to get to the consumer, and those businesses looking to avoid trips to the post office can turn to Stamps.com (STMP).Stamps.com Inc provides Internet-based mailing and shipping solutions throughout the United States and Europe. In the words of the Stamps.com Chairman and CEO from the second quarter earnings release, ""In recent months, e-commerce has provided an important lifeline to many businesses and individuals in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic"". This success was reflected in the company’s second quarter earnings report.Stamps.com posted a 49% year-over-year increase in revenue to $207 million for the second quarter of 2020. Earnings per share rose 148% to $3.11 for the quarter and EBITDA was up 106% with an EBITDA margin of 39%. Both revenue and earnings sharply exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for the quarter.With second quarter results the company raised guidance for the 2020 fiscal year, projecting revenue of $650-725 million and EPS of $6.25-9.25. This compares to 2019 revenue of $572 million and EPS of $5.73. Also, in August 2020 the company approved a new share repurchase program of up to $40 million.The company targets individual mailers, small business and home office mailers, large organizations, and e-commerce shippers. Stamps.com lets customers print mailing and shipping labels at home, also offering advance features for higher volumes shippers, such as batch printing of shipping labels. Using the company’s services helps customers save both time and money, an attractive proposition.For the second quarter of 2020, paid customers rose to 956,000 from 742,000 in the prior year, with the company also reporting an increase in quarterly average monthly revenue per paid customer. Yet the company believes there is significant opportunity to further grow customers. As seen in the chart below, the company estimates over 30 million potential customers exist, compared to the 956,000 currently engaged.Already expectations for the holiday season include increased online shopping as many large retailers announce plans to be closed on Thanksgiving Day. With less in-person shopping opportunities and as consumers continue to support small businesses, STMP should see strong volume trends throughout the rest of the calendar year.Merger rumors also surround STMP with Citron Research predicting in July that Shopify (SHOP) will buy STMP. Citron called STMP “the proven leader in online postage” and noted STMP was “the essential tool for small biz”. Even without an announced deal, the reasons STMP is an attractive target for SHOP are the same reasons benefitting current shareholders.As preferences shifted, STMP stock saw a significant run-up in February, followed by a brief pull-back in March, before continuing to rise (see chart below). Current trading prices are roughly 2.6 times the price at the start of the year. However, should STMP hit the mid-point of 2020 guidance, the current share price would equate to a P/E ratio around 28x, which falls to the lower 20s if EPS approaches the high end of the range. Therefore, valuation remains attractive.STMP is an attractive way to play the trend of increased e-commerce activity. Unlike some other re-opening plays, customers' and businesses’ accelerated adoption of e-commerce is expected to remain stickier, and not fall off as much as the economy returns to normal. Buying STMP now is an investment in the future state of online retail.*Like this article? Don't forget to hit the Follow button above!"
4326640,96766,2020-02-24T12:17:37-05:00,The stock went from significantly under-valued to very over-valued. the market is overreacting to news.Great business with high risk of new competitors will keep churn high and margins compressed.The current price is to optimistic and a share price of $95 is more realistic based on my DCF valuation.,"Source: Recapguide.comLast week I started writing an article on STMP where my recommendation was to short the stock as I valued STMP shares at $85. However, with the recent jump to $150 and a new agreement with UPS, I had to review my analysis. This article will provide a glance at STMP’s business, its value and the risks surrounding STMP.Stamps.com (STMP) stock dropped from $280 at the end of November 2018 to $200 by February 2019 due to a stagnation in customer growth. Then it dropped even further to $35 as STMP announced it is ending its exclusivity with USPS. The reason for ending the exclusivity with USPS was that STMP was not able to renew the revenue-share agreement. So STMP decided to lower its dependence on USPS and pursue a multi-carrier strategy. The strategy seems to work as STMP was able to obtain a deal with UPS in October 2019 which sent the shares to $90.STMP provides Internet-based mailing and shipping solutions. It means that rather than going with your packages to a postal office, wait in line and mail your items, you can print the postage from your home office and schedule the carrier to pick up and ship the items. The advantage may seem minimal for the regular person that mails packages once in a while, but for small and medium businesses that sell items on Amazon (AMZN), Etsy (ETSY), Shopify (SHOP) and other platforms, the advantage is significant.As mentioned in the introduction, till the end of 2018, STMP had an exclusivity agreement with USPS. However, the exclusivity was over as both parties did not come to an agreement regarding the revenue-sharing model. Since then STMP has been going for a multi-carrier strategy and has already secured a deal with United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS).This is a great business. It has a light-capex model with high marginal ROIC for each newly acquired client. That means the investment of bringing a new client is minimal. In addition, the threat that the carriers enter STMP’s turf is low as the business that goes through STMP represents only 4% of the revenue of the top 4 carriers.Source: Company presentationHaving said that, the barriers to entry are low. So STMP’s strategy has been to buy out the competition. Since 2014 and 2018, STMP acquired 5 competitors for almost $550 million USD.The agreement mentioned during the last earnings call and the above-expectation results for 4Q19, sent the shares soaring by 60% to $150. The deal with UPS would allow STMP to offer to their customers' discounts of 55% on UPS packages. While STMP customers already had access to UPS, the new agreement will make the process easier. For example, a new UPS account will be set up by default for all new and existing customers.In the US, STMP’s strategy is to invest heavily in the shipping part of the business rather than in the small business segment. Shipping customers are more expensive to acquire but have lower churn, higher usage and have a larger ARPU.STMP is planning to leverage the MetaPack acquisition to expand globally. They will start by expanding into English-speaking countries such as Canada, UK and Australia, but are also planning to expand into France.My DCF values STMP shares at $95. My main assumptions are below:Source: Author estimatesThe decline in 2019 revenues was a result of the discontinuation of the exclusivity with USPS. Going forward, I see a small customer growth rate thanks to the agreement with UPS but I don’t see explosive growth as churn might increase as competition could pick up.Gross margin declined due to the increase of lower-margin businesses such as GlobalPost, Global Advantage Program and MetaPack. Going forward, I expect a continuation in margin compression as STMP will expand globally. Also, I suspect that increased competition in the US will pressure margins until the return on investment is around the cost of capital.The current share price of $150 is assuming a constant 2% revenue growth forever and gross margin returning to the historical level of 77%. Seen from a different angle, the current price implies a required rate of return of just 4.5%.I think that is a very bullish scenario. First, the competitive environment is intensifying and acquiring new customers will be tougher and more expensive. Also, returning to historical gross margin will be difficult due to competition and global expansion.The main risk that I see is regarding customer growth. I may have overestimated competition and they may not able to replicate an agreement similar to the STMP-UPS agreement. If STMP can keep revenue growth above 10% for the medium term, the stock could be worth more than $210.STMP investors tend to over-react. When the USPS deal was stopped, the stock went from $200 to $30, then as the market had time to digest the news, the price climbed to a more reasonable $80-$90 level. But after the announcement of the UPS deal, the stock soared above $150. Again, I think the market over-reacted and are assuming that this partnership will reignite growth and recover margins. I think the market has changed and competition will intensify. A price of $95 sounds more reasonable and I would only consider entering below $65."
4325564,69905,2020-02-20T08:34:28-05:00,"Stamps.com's new guidance points to approximately 2% of top-line growth for 2020.A new share repurchase program announced, to be completed within six months.Not the cheapest stock available, but far from death's door as many had expected.","Stamps.com (STMP) had fallen from grace but is now back on the offense.Even though its shares are not cheaply valued, and the company is not expected to grow its revenues at a fast clip, its prospects are clearly not as grim as many had expected.With a brand new share repurchase program, together with a strong balance sheet with net cash of $100 million, I believe this stock is worthwhile considering. Here's why:Stamps.com has offered shareholders a roller coaster these past two years. First selling-off aggressively from mid-2018 into early 2019. Before a strong share price appreciation culminating with more than 30% increase in AH trading. Realistically, today's shareholders will feel exuberant.Indeed, what's noteworthy about Stamps.com is that it is a meaningfully shorted stock, with approximately 21% of its float sold short. Given that its days to cover approach 9, this implies that stock is likely to rally significantly simply from short-sellers closing out their positions.Moving on, the graph that follows shows Stamps.com's revenue growth rate guidance into 2020:Source: author's calculations, *** guidanceObjectively, you can see when Q4 2019 results were reported, it translated into full-year 2019 only being down 3% year-over-year. Given how low expectations had become for Stamps.com's prospects, this met shareholders very positively.Looking ahead, Stamps.com is guiding for approximately 2% growth. The key takeaway here is that Stamps.com has staying power when many thought that after losing its favorable exclusive USPS contract, it implied that its business model would implode. The facts show this to be otherwise.Stamps.com has a new partnership with UPS (UPS) that allows Stamps.com to provide a discount to customers of up to 55%.New and existing Stamps.com customers will be given UPS as a default option and with clear and seamless solutions, without overbearing and confusion waiver options. The general premise behind this new contract with UPS is to drive increased shipping volume to UPS.Furthermore, the tie-up with UPS allows Stamps.com to provide more options to its customers from smaller residential packages to large packages aimed at businesses. My point?The overall message here is to remind readers that Stamps.com is here to stay and that it has unquestionably put behind itself the loss of its favorable contract with USPS.In a further sign of confidence over its long-term prospects, Stamps.com not only repurchased $43 million worth of stock since March 2019 to the present time, but it has newly announced a brand new share repurchase program of $40 million expected to be terminated over a six month period.Put another way, given that Stamps.com has close to none existent capital expenditure requirements and carries close to $100 million in net cash; thus Stamps.com believes that the best use of its capital at present is to repurchase its shares.What has put me off Stamps.com in the past has been its incessant need for expensive M&A to grow its operations. In my previous article I highlighted the following table:Hence, although Stamps.com is guiding for adjusted EBITDA to be to reach close to $145 million, this figure carries very little weight. Why?Firstly, as noted, this EBITDA figure does not factor in its regular acquisitions. So even though Stamps.com makes strong cash flows, it then regularly buys up companies offering its operations an unsustainable boost.Secondly, as you see below a huge portion of its EBITDA is stock-based compensation that will dilute its shareholders.Source: Q4 2019 press statementConsequently, I believe readers would do well to use Stamps.com's GAAP net income as guidance.Consider this, if take Stamps.com's guided top end of its net income guidance of $52.6 million, and use Stamps.com's total guided number of shares outstanding of 18.5 million (for year-end 2020, given on the earnings call) this implies that Stamps.com's present market cap is already $2.3 billion.Now, let me ask the reader, if Stamps.com trades for 43x net income with less than 4% top-line growth, does this offer investors a large margin of safety? I fail to believe so.On the other hand, as I noted earlier, Stamps.com carries a very strong balance sheet and has minimal need for capital reinvestment, so its net income can simply be used to repurchase its own shares, and herein I believe a bullish thesis can be built.Stamps.com firmly put naysayers back in their corners. Its operations are evidently not unraveling and with new agreements in place with carriers, Stamps.com has staying power.Even though its present valuation is slightly punchy for this author, I believe that investors are likely to bid these shares higher as expectations for this company had been too low for too long."
4307712,104609,2019-11-19T10:57:21-05:00,"Stamps.com rose with Amazon and now may fall by Amazon due to its development of better in-house shipping services.Competition in shipping SaaS is rapidly growing and, because barriers to entry are low, Stamps.com is quickly losing its profitability moat.While revenue per user and number of users slip, overhead costs are rising at an accelerating pace.I believe the company was closer to fair value in May at a price of $35.","Stamps.com has been on a wild ride. Up until last year, Stamps.com (STMP) was a major benefactor of the ""Amazon Effect"". The boom in entrepreneurial online selling caused revenue for companies offering streamlined shipping solutions to skyrocket. Stamps.com helps sellers easily buy labels at a discounted price and efficiently process customer orders.As the boom grew, STMP's price rose from $8 in 2008 to $285 in 2018 and actually outperformed (AMZN) by a decent margin during the end of its price bubble. However, as shown below, STMP's stock price collapsed once AMZN's made a top:Many today have become hopeful that the company can return to its previous growth path, but in my opinion, the company's current core business model is flawed and the company lacks a moat to deal with rapidly growing competition. While it was cheap in May, now that the stock has doubled it may be a good time to sell before investors realize the company's sales are likely on a long-term downward trend.I actually used to be a seller on Amazon and know firsthand how useful the tools Stamps.com sells are. That said, because of my experience, I also realize how difficult it will be for Stamps.com to maintain users without losing profits.I used services like Stamps.com's Shipstation for some time. But, as my business grew, I quickly found that it was easiest to ship directly through Amazon's ""Fulfill by Amazon"" program, even for items not sold on Amazon. The problem is that the barriers to entry to this market are very low. Certain subsidiaries like Shipstation have a pretty strong customer base due to network effects, but they all lack a strong moat and competition is burgeoning. There are now literally hundreds of web-based shipping software available that will likely take customers from Stamps.com and force the company to overspend on online marketing.Stamp.com's strategy for dealing with growing competition is simply to try to buy all of its competitors. These currently include Shipstation, Shipworks, Endicia, MetaPack, and Shipping Easy (not to be confused with a competitor EasyShip which is a competitor).All of these subsidiaries perform the same function: Web-based shipping and sales analytics with third-party integrations to online retailers. The added benefit of these acquisitions is they can indirectly sell stamps.com subscriptions through subscriptions to their subsidiary websites. However, there are now so many multi-channel online shipping tools that offer label discounts that Stamps.com has few long-term competitive advantages.On top of that, the era of the small online selling entrepreneur Stamp.com's primary customer) is, in my opinion, slowly dying. Huge (primarily overseas) producers have finally learned to cut out the middle-man and sell directly on Amazon (or equivalents). Over time, this will likely mean many online shipping companies like Stamps.com will lose their customer base as their ""home business"" customer base shrinks.The market seemed to realize this last year when (STMP) fell from $285 all the way to $34 in May of this year. At that point, the stock was a bit undervalued and had a very low P/E ratio, but now that it's back up to $85, it may be a good time to sell. To begin, take a look at how the company's sales have made a clear top and is now back on the decline. I also included various levels of income to show how its profit margins are quickly declining and likely to push the company into a loss in Q4: There are two main causes of the company's revenue decline, stagnation in customer growth, and a decline in revenue per customer. Both of these problems are due to the confluence of increased competition in the space and growing consolidation in E-Commerce as a whole.As you can see below, revenue per customer has been flat this year and below 2018 levels:(Q3 Stamps.com Presentation)The same pattern is reflected in total customers:(Q3 Stamps.com Presentation)It is understandable for a company to have either stagnant customer growth and rising revenue per customer as that would imply the company is trying to acquire higher quality and likely lower churn clients. It would also be reasonable to have stagnated revenue per customer and a rising number of customers as that would imply they are trying to seize market share. However, for Stamp.com both of those key factors are slipping which is a sign of a competitive disadvantage. We can actually get an idea of this competition directly by looking at google search volume trends. Take a look at search popularity for the listed terms:Note, Shipstation and Shipworks are Stamp.com's subsidiaries(Google Trends)The problem is actually pretty simple. Stamps.com's competitors are forced to compete with each other since they all perform essentially the same function under different brands. It was smart of Stamps.com to acquire Shipstation as it is now one of the largest in the industry, but the brand's growth has devalued the Shipworks brand. Shippo, a competing brand not owned by Stamps.com, has been growing faster as they've made efforts to undercut Shipstation. Stamps.com's strategy of buying any and all potential competitors will continue to be a steep uphill battle. As I mentioned earlier, the barriers to entry are relatively low and there are now hundreds of these SaaS firms that do the same function and all have the same selling points. For now, Stamps.com still has the brands with the largest customer base, but I believe ultimately the space will be dominated by the likes of Amazon. I was one of the initial users of Amazon FBA's multi-channel fulfillment and it enabled me to run an importing and online sales business without ever needing to touch or even see the products since they went to Amazon's warehouses and, when someone purchased from my site, would be automatically fulfilled.Thus, Amazon can do exactly what Stamps.com can and much more. While Amazon's analytics may not be as good as that of Stamps.com's subsidiaries, they can easily be improved.Put simply, Stamps.com's revenue will likely be ultimately doomed unless they can somehow build a physical moat via warehouse fulfillment services. Amazon FBA is one example, but perhaps a better one is EasyShip which not only has the same services as SippingEasy/Shipstation but also has 3rd party warehouse integration.To explain exactly what I mean, take a look at this diagram from BigCommerceTake a look at the Google Trends search volume for Stamps.com's subsidiary Shipping Easy which does not have 3rd party fulfillment vs. Easyship which does:If the trend toward third-party fulfillment expands and Stamps.com does not adapt, I expect the company's revenue to decline at an increasing rate.While the company's sales and likely future sales are on the decline, overhead costs continue to mount:If this trend continues it will be highly problematic for the firm. Marketing costs are likely to continue to rise as Stamp.com and subsidiaries fight for the top-seat on Google Adwords. I am a bit surprised by how fast R&D spending is rising. It is worth noting that STMP currently spends 14% of its revenue on R&D while technology companies Apple (AAPL) and (IBM) spend 6% and 7% respectively. Overall, STMP looks like a clear ""sell"". With a P/E ratio of just under 20X and a negative expected earnings outlook, I believe the company was closer to fair value in May when it was trading at $32 (nearly 60% lower). If they can create a strategy to keep customers (and keep them happy), the company has the potential to turn around declining sales, but I expect competition to continue to create major difficulties for some time. Accordingly, I may short STMP with a price target range of $30-$40."
4285512,103738,2019-08-14T12:13:32-04:00,"Stamps.com had a good run as it gobbled up all its immediate competitors and introduced many new offerings.
        However, the further shift in consumer preferences to a one-stop-shop for their eCommerce shopping experiences has left the company in the rear view mirror.
        With declines expected in EPS and sales in the coming years, I believe the company's best days are behind it and am bearish on the company's year ahead.
        I believe the company's fair values lies at about half its current market valuation.","Stamps.com (STMP) is a shipping company, for lack of a more expansive description. It offers online shipping solutions for folks at home and businesses through its various services around the US and the world. The problem with this business model is that it's essentially obsolete. Mega online shopping giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Alibaba (BABA) either have their own shipping partners and contracts with USPS (US Postal Service) or standalone companies like FedEx (FDX) or UPS (UPS) and some are even exploring their own shipping mechanism via drones and automated trucks. This means that with the lack of an edge which will cause those shopping online to move over to a different service to start messing around with shipping (spoiler alert: there is none and they don't), the company doesn't have that high chance of survival.The company did find a certain niche in the shipping market since its founding but given the further shift in trends to favor in-house shipping options from the various companies (one-stop-shops), I believe the company's sales and thus valuation has peaked long ago and even current valuations seem overstretched. I've previously written about Amazon's own delivery system push, which will not only save it money from third party shipping, but makes for a wise investment in infrastructure for the future of shipping and helps retain customers who seek the lowest possible shipping costs, given that companies like Amazon simply take on the cost of shipping altogether.As we continue to purchase more and more of our products (and services) online, shipping demand is set to continue its surge, pushing the CAGR of the eCommerce logistics market to 20.7%, expected to reach nearly $530 billion by 2025. Even though this does include other services than just shipping, the shift in consumer preferences to shopping online, even amongst the older generations, is set to continue this growth rate into the future. However, most of these services are linked to a specific company and there isn't a real need for an intermediary between eCommerce companies and the shipping companies so the available market for Stamps.com is smaller than you'd think.Back in the day, Stamps.com was a small company which competed with multiple other services like Endicia, ShippingEasy, ShippingStation, shipWorks and Ship Engines but then began gobbling them up to form one mega shipping services company. It bought ShipWorks and ShippingStation in 2014, Endicia in 2015 and ShippingEasy in 2016 to become the monster it is today. With all those companies combined, they now rake in over $500 million every year, even though those expectations are sliding in recent months. Even with this rather diverse offering platform and a significant market share in their direct-to-market shipping services, the company has faced some tough headwinds with regard to their partnerships with the US Postal Service, as reviewed more extensively by Paulo Santos in his latest article Stamps.com: The Other Shoe Drops. This has dampened long term sales growth prospects, which in turn caused a massive downward revision to both earnings and sales.For 2019, the company is expected to report sales of $539.34 million, after reporting $586.9 million in 2018 and 2020 is expected to see a further decrease in sales to $519.97 million. The company did manage to increase its core services sales segment by 2.1% (91% of revenues) but saw a significant decrease in its insurance, product and customized revenues in H1 of 2019. To add insult to injury, the company did not manage to curtail expenses which rose significantly as marketing and SG&A spending increased much faster than the 2.1% growth rate in its services segment. Even more so, it looks like the company only managed to get this bump in sales due to heavy discounting as cost of sales (of the services segment) increased by 49.5% in the first half of 2019 compared to the same period last year. These trends become clear when we see what analysts expect for the company's EPS in the coming 2 years. After reporting EPS of $4.86 in 2018, they are expected to report $2.18 in 2019 and $0.79 in 2020, pointing to further headwinds and higher expenses in order to manage that declining revenue figure. Even though the purchase of those other companies increased the company's market share, it doesn't seem to have helped margins at all.The company holds $109 million in cash and equivalents, having burnt through about $4 million in cash in the first half of 2019. The problem with the company's balance sheet is that 63% of their assets ($533 million) are in the form of goodwill and intangible assets, which they've taken on when they acquired the other companies. This means that the actual value of the company is significantly lower than the $842 million in assets on its books given the near-zero real value of these assets in case of liquidation. It's unclear how much these assets will be valued in a buyout but at this moment in time it's hard to see them being valued around current market valuation of $1 billion. The company also pays $2.8 million annually in interest expense on its $44 million in debt it took on to fund these buyouts, meaning they pay a high 6.4% interest rate as a fixed rate. Beyond the aforementioned goodwill and other intangible assets, they do hold $34 million in property and equipment.All in all, the company is well within its reach to pay back all its debt and continue to burn through its cash in order to bounce back or partner with other major companies to enhance their offerings but for the time being I still believe that the company is overvalued.Simply given the lack of growth in sales and EPS I don't believe an earnings multiple of over 12x is justified, presenting a fair value of $26.16 per share, around half what it's currently valued at. With sales expected to be just over $500 million and showing no growth, a sales multiple of 1x provides the same valuation at roughly half of its current $1 billion valuation. Even though Stamps.com is far off its high of around $250.00 per share, it's apparent that the company is not well positioned to handle its sales declines which are expected in the coming years. These sales declines are expected to take place even after significant discounting has taken occurred, meaning that once these are no longer an option the company will experience the significant drop in profitability, as analysts expect them to do in 2020. All in all, I don't believe the company is fairly valued and think that a $26.00 per share valuation is more appropriate, meaning that the company is currently valued at nearly double that number. I believe that the company's best days are indeed behind them, unless they dramatically shift their focus to partnerships with long-term durable shipping and eCommerce giants and am currently bearish on the company's year ahead."
4285288,69905,2019-08-13T17:20:08-04:00,"After the challenging year Stamps.com has had, Q2 2019 offered investors some respite.Substantial acquisitions and heavy stock-based compensation take away from Stamps.com's bottom line profitability.On balance, its valuation is starting to look attractive.","Stamps.com (STMP) is a stock which has rapidly fallen from grace. Naturally, this appeals to my contrarian, deep value stance. Stamps.com is trying very hard to steady its footing.For now, its valuation, despite being more attractive, is still slightly expensive for this value investor.Back in March 2019, when the share price was approximately $83, I wrote an article titled, My Lessons In Sunken Cost Bias, and here is an excerpt:The point of that article was to describe how I had spent a considerable amount of time attempting to ascertain all the moving parts of an investment in Stamps.com and whether it carried enough margin of safety. At the time, I concluded by saying that investors would be better off not getting involved with the company.Today's share price is a more appealing $55 and $1.2 billion market cap - essentially the same price Stamps.com was in 2015.Looking ahead, Stamps.com still carries a lot of uncertainty, predominantly around whether it will continue to be as acquisitive as it has been in the past.Below is a table from my previous article to get a feel for Stamps.com's cash flow movements.For example, for 2018, Stamps.com's cash flow from operations reached $276 million. But that year, Stamps.com spent $209 million in the acquisition of MetaPack. Consequently, Stamps.com's 2018 actual free cash flow is not $273 million, but closer to $60 million once MetaPack is incorporated.Passionate shareholders might contend that acquisitions are not typically factored into free cash flow calculations. And they would be correct were it not for the recurring nature of acquisitions which Stamps.com embarks on.Another problem for shareholders is that it's difficult to know what Stamps.com's profit margins are likely to look like in 2020.The fact that the USPS commission revenue has been eliminated is one problem. Lower margins as Stamps.com broadens its international offering is another problem.On the other hand, Stamps.com is determined to broaden its portfolio of solutions so customers can use alternatives to the USPS.Having said that, when it comes to Stamps.com's margin profile, investors should remember that the real cost to its operations is in the form of stock-based compensation which amounts to $45 million for 2019.Given that Stamps.com's full-year 2019 GAAP midpoint net income is only expected to reach $35 million, this does not leave investors with enough to make for a highly compelling investment.Stamps.com's balance sheet carries $110 million of cash and equivalents and approximately $56 million of total debt, thus a solid $54 million net cash position.Given that it continues to be a solid cash flow generating company, and its share price collapsed, it is nice to see Stamps.com have a share repurchase program.Since announcing its share repurchase program in March 2019, through to the end of June 2019, Stamps.com had repurchased approximately $20 million worth of stock at approximately $68 per share.Given how aggressively the company was repurchasing the stock in the first quarter, and only a further $10 million after the first quarter, it highlights a management team which is either a poor capital allocator, or a management team which was caught flat-footed with the loss of the USPS commission revenue, or both. Either way, investors should be wary of just how much trust one puts into this management team.Superficially, Stamps.com has the trademark of a very attractive investment.It appears to be an asset-light operation. However, as highlighted above, it is a consistent acquirer of companies, which takes substantial cash flows away from shareholders.Secondly, it has a disproportionately high stock-based compensation structure.Finally, for the full year 2019, Stamps.com's bottom-line GAAP EPS number is expected to reach approximately $2.00 at the mid-point. Given that the share price is still above $55, this puts the stock at a forward multiple of 22x, which becomes interesting if the company can continue to grow in 2020.Stamps.com is undergoing a very dynamic period in its operations. Realistically, for now, there is very little light at the end of the tunnel.Having said that, investors should be realistic that despite diminished profit margins going forward, there is still a very much worthwhile and cash flow generating business, which already has much of the downside priced in already.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."
4262110,25047,2019-05-09T15:00:21-04:00,"A while ago, when Stamps.com was down hard, I said that there was yet another shoe to drop.That shoe has now dropped.Most of the worst is over, but unfortunately, not all of it.","There was another shoe, after all.A bit less than three months ago, I wrote an article titled “Stamps.com: Amazingly, The Biggest Shoe Is Yet To Drop.” The thesis described in that article was simple:Yesterday, this other shoe dropped. Along with yet another cut to earnings guidance, in its earnings call, Stamps.com disclosed that the USPS is seeking to renegotiate the existing reseller NSAs.In doing so, USPS is likely to take yet another large bite out of Stamps.com’s earnings, since these earnings are in large part derived from arbitraging USPS rates via the reseller agreements.Stamps.com first tried arguing that it isn’t alone in leeching off these agreements (highlight is mine):But then just straight out spilled the beans (highlight is mine):Although Stamps.com also tries to say that many others will be hit, the hard reality is that Stamps.com simply got too good at exploring these reseller agreements. Stamps.com again reinforces this by saying that it now represents more than 35% of the US domestic priority mail packages shipped by USPS. Though there will be unintended collateral damage, it’s obvious that the USPS is aiming directly at Stamps.com here. The failure to renew the direct NSA had made this other move likely as well.The dropping of the second shoe, and the immediate impact on guided-for profitability, is the main theme here. However, two further impacts merit mention:What these worries mean, in the aggregate, is the same. The worst doesn’t seem to be over, even if with this latest development, most of the worst is now likely over.There are two conclusions to be drawn here:Anyway, after this latest development, we can arguably be neutral regarding Stamps.com. It's hard to be positive even at $44.40, because business and margin pressure might well last into 2020/2021. It's also hard to be negative when the two most relevant problems have now already materialized."

But that is now old news. Indeed, Stamps.com and UPS have reignited their partnership earlier in 2020. And the share price has been on a strong rally and repriced significantly higher.Having said that, Stamps.com's revenue growth rates are now back at the forefront of the investment thesis, and it doesn't look all that strong.Source: author's calculations, ***reiterated guidanceI've taken the midpoint of its 2020 revenue guidance of $585 million. One could argue that Stamps.com may deliver towards the top end of this guidance, given that it benefited from an unexpectedly strong March as well as a remarkably strong April when customer acquisition was up 300% year-over-year.Furthermore, even at the top end of its guidance, Stamps.com's 2020 revenue growth rate would be shy of 5%, a fairly middling growth story.As a sanity check, I looked up what analysts were estimating into next year:Source: seekingalpha.com Premium ToolsMoving on, Stamps.com's balance sheet is one of its strongest aspects. It carries a net cash position of approximately $168 million. Given that its market cap is $3.2 billion, this implies that approximately 8% of its market cap is made up of net cash. Furthermore, given that Stamps.com is fairly cash generative, this affords Stamps.com plenty of maneuverability.One area of concern for me is that a large amount of Stamps.com's cash flows during Q1 2020 came from management cashing in their options. To put this figure in context, as of the 13th of April, there were just over 1 million shares that could become exercisable over the following 60-day period.Given the strong run on Stamps.com's share price, together with the reality that most likely all these options are holding significant gains, it is highly likely management will execute a large portion of these shares rather soon.To put this figure in context, Stamps.com has 18.2 million shares outstanding, and this would dilute shareholders by just over 5.5%.Even at the top end of its non-GAAP EPS guidance of $5 per share, paying 38x times forward earnings for a company likely to grow at sub 10% growth rate is a fairly punchy multiple.The video together with the article notes that although Stamps.com had a successful turnaround, that the upside right now is not as compelling."
4261974,102756,2019-05-09T12:34:58-04:00,"STMP refuses to give investors the revenue and EBITDA it derives from the USPS reseller program, but it did provide a way to get ""pretty close""
        I estimate reseller revs are $251M and margins are 90%.
        Assuming 25-100% of the revenue goes away over the next 1.5yrs, STMP EBITDA may drop 36.5% - 145% from the original 2019 estimate.
        Based on my estimates, STMP is worth $21.50 per share.","Please read the full disclaimer at the end of the report before reading further. This report represents the opinion of the author. Investors should do their own due diligence and come to their own conclusions.IntroductionPeople often say the easy money in shorting stocks is made on the first big drop. I disagree. That is the hard, grind money that often requires losing money for years before you are right. I think this is never more true than it is with Stamps.com (NSDQ: STMP). The easy money in STMP is/was realizing that the growth story is over and the market coming to grips with reality. I think STMP has another 43% to fall. My price target is $21.50.Triangulating Reseller Revenues and EBITDA DropStamps.com (NSDQ: STMP) has fallen 50% on the last two consecutive quarters as it has announced major changes unfolding in its USPS/reseller revenue model. Still, the company has refused to tell investors how much revenue and EBITDA it generates from the reseller program, but management gave some metrics for investors to get ""pretty close."" Here is what was said on yesterday's call:So STMP has provided investors a way to triangulate how much money it generates from monthly subscription fees. And since it lost its ""label fee"" revenue with the USPS deal thru Stamps and Endicia, it is my understanding that the only remaining revenue in 2019 is from the reseller revenue share (excluding the recent acquisition of MetaPack). So as they said, I can net out estimated subscription revenues and should get pretty close to reseller revenues.To start, I am going to use their original 2019 revenue guidance because I assume that it did not contemplate a loss of reseller revenue, which management now says should start to go away in the second half of 2019 (""We believe that is reasonably likely that margins earned by resellers as a result of these negotiations will begin to decrease starting around the second half of 2019 and may continue to decrease in 2020 and 2021."").The mid-point guidance was $555M.Second, I back out the 2019 estimate revenues for MetaPack. I assume $51.5M, which I took from an analyst model. This leaves us with $503.5M, which again from my understanding is made up of subscription revenues and reseller revenue share. Please note that because STMP does not provide details on its revenue streams, that this assumption could be wrong.Now, I need to take estimates for the number of customers across their different platforms (ShipStation, ShipWorks, ShippingEasy, Stamps.com and Endicia) and apply the lower quartile subscription fee as the ARPU for each of these customers. For simplicity, I combine Shipstation (""SS""), ShipWorks (""SW"") and ShippingEasy (""SE"") into one category and Stamps.com and Endicia into another. I think this makes sense because the pricing of the multi-carrier platforms and Stamps/Endicia are relatively similar.Below I show the pricing from each as listed on their website.Source: Shipping Software for Ecommerce Fulfillment | ShipStationSource: Shipworks.comSource: Shipping EasySource: www.Stamps.com Source: www.Endicia.comBelow are my estimates for number of customers across the platforms, average monthly ARPU across the platforms, my estimate for total reseller revenues and the potential EBITDA loss depending on how much of that estimate STMP loses over the next year or two. Note: Because STMP does not disclose the figures, I obviously do not know how many customers are on each platform nor the price level. Accordingly, my customer number per platform is based on my research and discussions with industry participants , and I use the average of the middle pricing tiers in an effort to be conservative. Investors should run their own numbers and come to their own conclusions.Source: Table by Author, Using Author's EstimatesBased on my estimates, reseller revenue is $251M and using my estimate of 90% contribution margin and assuming different loss levels of the reseller revenues thru 2021 (as stated by management on the call), I believe Stamps may lose between 36.5% and 145% of its previous 2019 midpoint EBITDA Guidance of $155M.Using the 50% reduction (which I think is conservative) and assuming the rest of the business remains constant, I estimate STMP will be doing approximately $42M in EBITDA sometime in late 2020/early 2021. Using a 8x multiple this would be a $335M enterprise value or approximately $21.50 per share. Note that I have not assumed any share buyback in this number.Source: Table by Author, Using Author Estimates"
4256266,103970,2019-04-24T12:41:09-04:00,"Stamps.com’s stock price plummeted after it ended its exclusive agreement with the United States Postal Service.Another threat to Stamps.com’s business model includes Amazon’s aggressive expansion into the shipping market.The past growth of this company has been spectacular, but the future paints a dimmer picture.Factual evidence tells about the real value vs. stock price.","Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) has been offering customers the ability to print postage on demand from their own printers for about the past two decades. Stamps.com was one of the first companies to be approved by the USPS and to introduce Internet postage to the market. But now, the exclusive agreement that Stamps.com maintained with the USPS is ending, and this has caused the stock price to fall and many investors to begin questioning the future of this company.Before thoroughly analyzing this company, I glanced at its impressive past fundamentals and potential value and thought that it was worth looking at. But my hypothesis is that, ending the partnership with the USPS will cause great instability for this company in the coming years. In addition, I feel that this company may now lack a competitive advantage that will continue to erode its margins in the future. Finally, I believe that a company like this with little physical assets and without proprietary protection can easily be toppled by the next better idea or shipping/postage software. Now, let’s dive into this company to reveal the facts and to see what the future might hold.A fast way for me to get an overall understanding of the condition of the business is to use the BTMA Stock Analyzer’s company rating score. It shows a score of around 56/100. Therefore, Stamps.com is not considered to be a good company to invest in, since 70 is the lowest good company score. STMP has high scores for 10 Year Price Per Share, Gross Margin Percent, Ability to Recover from a Market Crash or Downturn. It has a mediocre score for Earnings Per Share. It has low scores for ROE, ROIC, PEG Ratio. A low PEG Ratio score indicates that the company may not be experiencing high growth consistently over the past 5 years. In summary, these findings show us that STMP seems to have below-average fundamentals since many of categories produce low scores.Before jumping to conclusions, we’ll have to look closer into individual categories to see what’s going on.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer)Let’s examine the price per share history first. In the chart below, we can see that price per share has been mostly consistently increasing over the last 10 years, with the exception of the past year where share price has declined significantly. Overall, share price average has grown by about 1,109% over the past 10 years or a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 31.9%. This is a spectacular return over this 10-year period.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer – Price Per Share History)Looking closer at earnings history, we see that earnings haven’t grown consistently over the past 10 years. The earnings had been gradually growing and then dipped negative before continuing its uptrend for these past two years.When looking at the big picture of STMP, its earnings history is fairly good, except for 2015; something happened this year to disrupt the consistent data of this company. One major event in March 2015 occurred when Stamps.com entered into an agreement to acquire Endicia internet postage company for about $215 million. Other major happenings in 2015 included Stamps.com being involved in government investigations, settlements, and related business model modifications, which negatively affected the bottom line of this business.Consistent earnings make it easier to accurately estimate the future growth and value of the company. So, in this regard, STMP is not an ideal candidate of a stock to accurately estimate future growth or current value.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer – EPS History)Since earnings and price per share don’t always give the whole picture, it’s good to look at other factors like the gross margins, return on equity, and return on invested capital.STMP’s 5-year average ROE is good at around 22%. For return on equity (ROE), I look for a 5-year average of 16% or more. So, STMP meets my requirements in that regard. The poor 2015 ROE data was a result of the factors stated in the earnings section.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer – ROE History)Let’s compare the ROE of this company to its industry. The average ROE of 355 Software (System & Application) companies is 13.47%.Therefore, Stamps.com’s 5-year average of 21.6% and current ROE of 34.6% are above average.The return on invested capital had been on a downtrend and then, after dipping negative, returned to reasonable levels for the past two years. This is a similar result as the ROE history. Five-year average ROIC is good at around 19%. For return on invested capital (ROIC), I also look for a 5-year average of 16% or more. So, STMP passes this test as well.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer – Return on Invested Capital History)The gross margin percent (GMP) has been stable and increasing over the last five years. Five-year GMP is very good at around 80%. I typically look for companies with gross margin percent consistently above 30%. So, STMP has proven that it has the ability to maintain acceptable margins over a long period. This is mostly attributable to the fact that Stamps.com offers digital postage, which doesn’t require large expenses for physical inventory or the costly upkeep of expensive machinery.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer – Gross Margin Percent History)Looking at other fundamentals involving the balance sheet, we can see that the debt-to-equity is less than 1. This is a good indicator, telling us that the company owns more than it owes.STMP’s Current Ratio of 1.79 is good, indicating that it has a good ability to use its assets to pay its short-term debt. Ideally, we’d want to see a Current Ratio of more than 1, so STMP exceeds this amount.According to the balance sheet, the company seems to be in good financial health. In the long term, the company is stable regarding its debt-to-equity. In the short term, the company’s financial situation is also solid.The Price-Earnings Ratio of 8.8 indicates that STMP might be selling at a low price when comparing STMP’s PE Ratio to a long-term market average PE Ratio of 15. The 10-year and 5-year average PE Ratio of STMP has typically been between 17 and 21, so this indicates that STMP could be currently trading at a low price when comparing to STMP’s average historical PE Ratio range.STMP does not currently pay a regular dividend to its shareholders.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer – Misc. Fundamentals)For valuation purposes, I will be using an adjusted diluted EPS of 8.99. I’ve used various past averages of growth rates and PE Ratios to calculate different scenarios of valuation ranges from low to average values. The valuations compare growth rates of EPS, Book Value, and Total Equity.In the table below, you can see the different scenarios, and in the chart, you will see vertical valuation lines that correspond to the table valuation ranges. The dots on the lines represent the current stock price. If the dot is towards the bottom of the valuation range, this would indicate that the stock is undervalued. If the dot is near the top of the valuation line, this would show an overvalued stock.(Source: Wealth Builders Club)According to this valuation analysis, STMP is undervalued if you expect the stock to perform in a similar way as in the past 10 and 5 years. However, if you rely heavily on the forecasted growth rates, then this stock is about fairly priced. This analysis shows an average valuation of around $366 per share versus its current price of about $81. This would indicate that Stamps.com is undervalued.According to the facts, Stamps.com is financially healthy in a long-term sense in having enough equity as compared with debt, and in the short term, because the current ratio indicates that it has enough cash to cover current liabilities.Other fundamentals are solid, including increasing price per share history, EPS history, and Gross Margin Percent history.Lastly, this analysis shows that the stock is undervalued if considering that the stock will continue to perform as it has in the past. This assumption is not realistic though, since many important changes have taken place. Namely, Stamps.com will no longer have an exclusive agreement with USPS. This fact alone will likely have a drastic effect on the future revenue of the company, and this news has already taken a toll on significantly affecting the share price negatively.In addition, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become a tough competitor in the shipping industry, as it has efficiently reduced shipping times to only two days with its guaranteed 2-day Prime shipping. Amazon has also expressed that it will become more aggressive in challenging the shipping industry.Also, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) utilizes Pitney Bowes, which offers its sellers USPS-approved postage rates that are lower than the other online USPS providers are allowed to offer.Another very worrisome concern is that Stamps.com doesn’t seem to really have a competitive market advantage anymore. Customers are required to pay a fee which was typically around $15-17 per month just for the ability to print postage from their personal printers. Keep in mind, this cost doesn’t include any postage; it’s just the fee to use their service.On the other hand, customers really don’t have a need to pay for Stamps.com’s service, since they can just as easily go onto USPS’s website and print digital postage at the same cost, without the $15-17 per month fee. In my opinion, this reason alone seems to make the service of Stamps.com unnecessary. I personally wouldn’t pay a monthly membership for something if I knew that I could get a similar service for free. Therefore, I believe that it’s just a matter of time before more existing Stamps.com customers realize this and stop using their service.Stamps.com admitted these facts in their fiscal 2015 SEC 10-K:From a valuation standpoint, the company might seem very much undervalued when considering the past performance of the company, but the company and shipping market have changed. The threats from Amazon and Pitney Bowes, the loss of the exclusive agreement with USPS, and the lack of need for Stamps.com’s main service have me passing on this company as an investment.I’ll admit that the company could continue to make some investors money, but I think that, eventually, this company will cease to effectively compete if it doesn’t begin adding real value, which is unique in its industry. The risks of this company outweigh the potential gains for me."
4251356,105120,2019-03-27T14:24:44-04:00,"Stamps.com's recent price drop may look like a buy-the-dip opportunity to a value investor if it is a case of market overreaction to a short term event.Unfortunately, upon looking deeper, it appears that Stamps.com has broken fundamentals that make it a vulnerable business with a poor growth prospect.With a revenue concentration risk, a disrupted business model, a potential conflict of interest, and questionable management behaviors, Stamps.com is a shaky business.Long investors should stay away from it because it is unlikely a quick turnaround story, while short investors may have further gains as more bad news is expected in the near future.","The share price of Stamps.com (STMP) dropped like a rock after its announcement of ending its exclusive shipping partnership with USPS, United States Postal Service, in order to pursue other private carriers. Stamps.com CEO Ken McBride claimed that the shifting market environment of the shipping and logistics industry was the main driver for the decision to break away from USPS, which, in McBride's prediction, would become less and less competitive in facing powerful new entrants like Amazon (AMZN). In doing so, Stamps.com guided its revenue down by 5% and halved its earnings guidance in 2019.Data by YChartsThe immediate negative reaction from the market is understandable. However, could such a drastic strategic shift be justifiable for the sake of its long-term prospect? Could this be a great buy-the-dip opportunity for a value-oriented investor because it might be a simple case of market overreaction to a short-term event? After all, Stamps.com has been an impressive growth company for the last few years. Unfortunately, this may not be a case of a quick rebound. Instead, it is likely a slow spiral down toward a smaller existence, if not irrelevance.In this article, I will explain why there are some flaws in Stamps.com's business model that leave me less optimistic about a potential speedy recovery and why I believe Stamps.com will likely be a much smaller company if it survives.It turns out that Stamps.com disproportionally relies on revenue sharing with USPS as its main profit driver. Such revenue concentration put it at risk of further significant revenue and profit guide down, a major risk that an investor cannot simply ignore.Stamps.com, in essence, is a software company offering shipping and logistics as a service. It is an attractive high margin business (78% gross margin and 28% profit margin), except for one flaw, it doesn't control any of the shipping/logistics infrastructures that underpin its service. This is made worse by the fact that it heavily relies on one single partner USPS for revenue.Stamps.com's heavy reliance on USPS can be a blessing but also a curse. With the exclusive partnership, Stamps.com, along with its subsidiary Endicia, was one of the very few companies that had benefited from having such privilege, making the business lucrative with a high barrier of entry (a desirable moat). However, on the flip side, such a concentration of power on one single partner makes the entire business vulnerable to relationship changes, and this was what just happened. Stamps.com's revenue is mainly driven by two sources: software subscription fees and revenue-sharing with shipping partners, either in the form of commission or a spread between the price it charges to customers and the price it pays to the partnering carriers. Prior to the announcement, it was unclear on how much of the company's profitability relied on the revenue sharing with USPS because they were all lumped together in one revenue category, Mailing and Shipping Business. It is now clear that the revenue sharing with USPS has disproportionally contributed to at least half of Stamps.com profit, and this is not all.During the most recent earnings call, CEO Ken McBride pointed out to the analysts that only the commission portion of the revenue under the Stamps.com and Endicia brands were impacted by the discontinuing of the USPS partnership, and other revenue-sharing arrangements with other USPS third-party resellers through its other brands (ShippingEasy, ShipWorks, and ShipStation) were intact. This may be good news for now. However, with USPS being in progress of reviewing its reseller program, there is always the risk of USPS canceling these other reseller agreements, making this portion of the profit contribution at risk as well. We don't know how big of an impact this could be. However, because these brands that Stamps.com acquired since 2014 have contributed significantly to its revenue and profit growth, one can reasonably expect the impact could be substantial. For example, McBride mentioned on the earnings call that ""the volume in that product [ShippingEasy] is almost exclusively USPS. So, that organization, even though it's multi-carrier, really focuses on driving USPS volume.""Hence, there is a fair chance that Stamps.com may need to further guide down its earnings significantly if any of the third-party resellers it currently works with loses the reseller status or is forced to stop revenue sharing with Stamps.com. This may leave Stamps.com with just the subscription revenue. Even that is at risk (more on that later).There are a few warning signs that Stamps.com's business model is being disrupted, making it a vulnerable business with a poor future growth prospect.The first warning sign is a buying binge that Stamps.com started since 2014, scooping up competitors one by one, with a total of 5 acquisitions, including ShipStation, ShipWorks, Endicia, ShippingEasy, and MetaPack. As a long-term growth investor, I am fine when a company uses acquisition as a means to boost organic growth by acquiring unique technologies, intellectual properties, and talents. However, when a company is buying up competitors with similar technologies and business models, it is a sign that the company is simply buying revenue to engineer growth and that the market is saturated with limited organic growth potential. That is not attractive to a growth investor, and it is typically a precursor of something worse to come, industry disruption.The second warning sign is an alarm that came directly from the management. During the earnings call, CEO Ken McBride spent a substantial amount time to describe the rapidly changing landscape in the shipping and logistics industry and the competitive threats posed by private carriers, especially from the powerful newcomer Amazon, to the business of USPS. Clearly, the industry is being disrupted, but unfortunately, Stamps.com is not the disrupter, but a part of the disrupted.With their 20-year partnership, Stamps.com and USPS are joined at the hip. When one is disrupted, so is the other. In anticipation of the disruption, Stamps.com management broke the tie with USPS so they could focus on a multi-carrier shipping solution as the new business model. This makes sense to a certain extent, except that the new business model will have worse economics and business dynamics than the old one.In Stamps.com's partnership with USPS, Stamps.com added value by providing shipping software solutions that USPS couldn't provide itself. Stamps.com's value proposition made sense at the time as both parties needed each other and the customers also benefited from such a partnership. Stamps.com was compensated by both the subscription fees from the end customers and the revenue-sharing from USPS, making it a very profitable business.In the new multi-carrier solution model, it may not work out the same way even though Stamps.com will likely pursue a similar financial arrangement. First of all, not all the major private carriers are as motivated as USPS to work with Stamps.com. They have all developed their own software solutions that are offered to their customers for free, as CEO Ken McBride repeatedly emphasized on the earnings call.Secondly, Stamps.com is not the only one in town offering a multi-carrier shipping solution. Many major e-commerce platforms are also beginning to develop or already offering their own shipping solutions to merchants on their platforms.For example, Shopify (SHOP), one of the major e-commerce platforms, is now offering its own integrated shipping solution in partnership with UPS (UPS), DHL, USPS and Canada Post. Such integrated service, which includes negotiated competitive rates with each carrier at no extra cost to the merchants on its platform, rendering Stamps.com's similar solution, e.g. its ShipStation brand has a shipping app on Shopify, much less attractive to these merchants.Such new market dynamics is making Stamps.com's multi-carrier shipping solution less valuable to both the customers and the carriers. The intensified competition will likely push Stamps.com's price for subscription down in order to attract customers, while at the same time, the more powerful negotiating position of the carriers will force Stamps.com to enter into less favorable revenue-sharing agreements, comparing to the one it had with USPS, negatively affecting its future profit margin.Worst of all, Stamps.com is actually vulnerable to losing its existing customers to the other carriers. As a recourse to compensate the lost revenue from USPS, CEO Ken McBride mentioned on the earnings call that Stamps.com will begin to charge 3% volume-based fees to its large shippers. Imagine how those customers will respond to such a sudden price hike. It will be natural for them to look for better alternatives, making them the prime targets for the other carriers to woo their business. These carriers will smell blood and will try to take Stamps.com's customers, which, of course, will hurt its subscription revenue.There was a bright spot in Stamps.com's brand portfolio. It is the MetaPack business that mainly operates in Europe, a fragmented market with hundreds of local carriers. The multi-carrier shipping solution is more valuable in a fragmented market like Europe and less so in a market like the U.S. that is dominated by a few large national players. MetaPack is fairly well established in Europe with a full suite of software that the customers may appreciate, making it a bright spot. Stamps.com may have to lean heavily on this part of its brand portfolio for future growth.Despite the original intention of its partnership with USPS, which was to help USPS fight the competition from the private carriers and stay relevant in the modern era, Stamps.com is in reality in the business to compete with USPS. This conflict of interest has been in the plain sight as Stamps.com put it bluntly on its 10K.I can only imagine USPS wouldn't appreciate such a competitive position from Stamps.com. I believe this is a case of the wrong incentives driving the wrong behaviors, the simple behavioral economics at work. The lucrative nature of the revenue sharing program has been driving the profit-maximizing nature of a corporation, incentivizing it to do everything it can to direct sales volume towards channels with the highest financial rewards, even it may mean cannibalizing USPS's other business. A 2017 Washington Post article attempted to articulate such conflict. Here are a few quick quotes.Unfortunately, the downside of doing this, hurting a major business partner's vital business interest, makes maintaining a healthy and sustainable business relationship difficult. Eventually, it will come to an end when one party realize the agreement has been overwhelmingly benefiting the other party, instead of equally beneficial to both.Alarmingly, a similar conflict of interest may potentially play out in the new multi-carrier business model. In such a model, Stamps.com adds value by acting as a neutral party to present the best shipping options to its customers and hence help its customers to optimize their shipping expenses. However, by pursuing a revenue-sharing arrangement with some carriers, Stamps.com risks losing that neutral position by being biased toward a carrier that offers the best financial incentive to Stamps.com but may not be the best option for its customers, and thus putting its customers' best interest at jeopardy. There is already a sign of this. During the earnings call, management stressed a point that they could drive their sales efforts to a certain carrier if it was financially beneficial to Stamps.com to do so. Here is a quote from president Kyle Huebner.In doing so, Stamps.com may sacrifice the best interest of its customers and erode the foundation of customer trust. Such a potential conflict of interest will likely act as a time bomb in a business model. One day, it may ignite and damage the business in the form of customer defection.As a long-term growth investor, I am not a fan of management focusing on maximizing short-term profit even at the cost of its most important stakeholders, damaging the company long-term interest as a result. This leads me to my next concern.When a company is going through a tough time, it is paramountly important to have a competent and honest management team to steer the company out of troubled water into the calmer sea. Unfortunately, Stamps.com's management team does not inspire strong confidence from me.Stamps.com disrupted its own business model in anticipation of a potential disruption. This may sound heroic, but it is borderline being reckless to me. If management believes the multi-carrier solution will be the future, why not take time to build up such a solution and to cultivate the critical new partnerships until they are ready to replace the USPS business? After all, the company has already acquired several brands with the multi-carrier model in the past few years. They could have taken the necessary time to do just that, including setting up a new partnership with Amazon, through these brands while still maintaining a productive relationship with USPS under the Stamps.com and Endicia brands, of which the exclusivity with USPS applied. Yet, the management chose to draw a line in the sand with USPS and took a ""take it or leave it"" grandstand position when they didn't yet have enough negotiating leverage, risking a major source of revenue stream.The company's recent 10K filing clearly spelled out the risk and consequence of losing the USPS revenue sharing arrangement and the unlikely prospect of having a replacement in 2019.Clearly, the management hadn't found any material replacement of the lost USPS revenue when they walked away from USPS, nor have we heard any announcement of a potential partnership with Amazon. It baffles me that the management was so eager to kill the cash cow while a viable alternative was nowhere in sight.Why did they end the relationship so abruptly like there was no choice? Or, could it be possible that the management was actually given no choice by USPS instead of the heroic walkout that the management portrayed on the earnings call?Already, some experts have questioned Stamps.com's characterization of the breakup with USPS. According to this Yahoo Finance article, Gordon Glazer, a consultant and an expert on the USPS shipping business suggested USPS was the party to drive the reform, and ultimately the ending of, the reseller program arrangement with Stamps.com.The entire episode leaves me with a lot of unanswered questions.Not to mention the announcement of the retirement of Stamps.com's president on the same day when the news of losing the USPS deal came as a bombshell. The management team seems to be ready to jump ship rather than to steer the ship to safety.As an investor, all these questionable behaviors from the management team give me a hard pause.I was hoping that Stamps.com could be a buy-the-dip opportunity. Instead, I come out from my research less confident about the company's future. Stamps.com's future is very uncertain with a high revenue concentration risk, a disrupted business model, a potential conflict of interest, and questionable management behaviors. I expect more bad news will come out and more management shake-ups are also likely.It is therefore unlikely to be a quick turnaround story, given its now-shaky business fundamentals. Stamps.com's management was right in setting an expectation of at least a 5-year recovery period if it even happens.There is a chance that the company can still survive with a business model focusing on a multi-carrier shipping solution, especially in the Europe and international markets. However, it will likely be a smaller operation with a thinner profit margin.If you are a long investor, you may want to stay away from Stamps.com for now until all the dirty laundries are aired and the management shake-up is complete with a clear path to recovery. On the flip side, there could be more downside opportunities for a short investor as a result of all the discussions above.In the end, I've learned a few warning signs to look for when analyzing future potential investment ideas. Before investing into a business, make sure to check if there is 1) a major revenue concentration, 2) any engineered growth through binge acquisitions, 3) industry disruption by an emerging powerful force, 4) any potential conflict of interest or wrong incentives in the business model, and finally, 5) any questionable management behaviors. As for investing in Stamps.com, I have other better places to put my capital that offer better risk/reward balance."
4251018,69905,2019-03-26T10:00:36-04:00,Sunk cost fallacy: when to say no?Stamps growth rate brought into question.Where is shareholders' cash going?,"When I first started to investigate Stamps.com (STMP), I was enthralled. There were many attributes which made this deep value investor want to invest in the stock.Right off the bat, the obvious one: that its share price had fallen by more than 60% in the past 6 months. Given that my investment style is to buy cheap companies when in trouble, I thought this surely would fit this meaningful criterion. Furthermore, as Warren Buffett reminded us during his recent endeavor with Kraft Heinz (KHC), buying a cheap stock in a troubled company can sometimes work out well. So here I was, spending time trying to figure out why investing in this company could work out satisfactorily. As investors, the more time we spend on a company, it is only natural that we become increasingly optimistic about its positive prospects, while at the same time turning down the volume on the negative reasons why it won't work out. And this is too common a mistake and makes it difficult to pull out and abort once we have spent a considerable amount of time researching and investigating a potential investment. For the remainder of the article, I will go through and highlight a couple of areas which helped me say no to investing in Stamps.com.Stamps.com had been growing its top line at a very fast clip. Its 3-year CAGR was approximately 40%, which had been impressive. Additionally, given that its midpoint revenue guidance for 2019 was still expected to hit roughly $555 million, despite losing its number one customer the US Postal Service, I got the impression that things weren't all that bad. This got me digging deeper into its cash flows. And presented below is a snapshot of where Stamps' cash flows have gone:Source: author's calculationsWhile Stamps' capex was minimal, at just $2 million to $4 million expected for 2019, Stamps' growth is largely based on a consistent need for acquisitions, which are expensive, as the table above shows.For example, in 2014 more was spent acquiring Endicia than Stamps generated from operations. Later, in 2018 yet another similarly large acquisition was made for MetaPack. Long story short, Stamps' cash flows are in large part driven by its continuous acquisitions, which history has taught us that time and time again, this type of strategy is a ticking time bomb, as management must continuously acquire expensive companies if it seeks to grow its top line - leaving not much in the way of margin for inevitable hiccups. The best type of businesses and the one I typically seek out for my Deep Value Returns platform are those businesses which are asset-light, which as I have discussed above, Stamps is not. On the other, a business which throws off plenty of free cash flow makes for an attractive investment. Accordingly, we arrive at another less obvious issue with Stamps. Admittedly, 2019 is set up to be a pretty challenging year for Stamps, but it only aids in driving home my point.Looking into 2019, at the midpoint guidance, Stamps' GAAP net income is expected to come in around $62 million. Given that even after the strong selloff in its share price, which still leaves the stock trading at more than 23 times forward earnings, this makes for a very punchy multiple. However, this is a distraction, my main issue is not the large multiple relative to forward earnings, although that never sets up the investor for a promising positive return. My fundamental issue is actually that at the midpoint of Stamps' net income (GAAP) guidance, nearly 65% of Stamps' net income was being allocated towards management's stock-based compensation, at no less than $40 million. Obviously, management spends its time highlighting to investors its strong cash flows and adjusted EBITDA figures, which are highly misleading in my opinion. I think the riskiest aspect of investing is assuming that we have any control over the future. Any certainty. Personally, I believe the best way to incorporate risk into my investment strategy is to appreciate that I don't know.Consequently, rather than being greedy and cocksure, investing is much more profitable if we are humble enough to admit that investing is challenging and requires the appreciation of several facets, both the positives and negatives, and lastly investing always requires a large margin of safety - which Stamps.com does not presently offer."
4243889,23998,2019-02-25T12:05:53-05:00,"Recently, I mentioned several lessons presented by the crash in Kraft Heinz. At least two of those lessons apply to the Stamps.com crash as well.One is that stop orders don't protect you when a stock gaps down below your stop price.Another is that hedging can ameliorate your losses even when a stock gaps down.","Stamps.com's homepage the weekend after announcing that its partnership with the US Postal Service had ended. Recently, I wrote about a few lessons offered by the crash in Kraft Heinz (KHC). Two of those lessons apply to Stamps.com (STMP) as well, as shown below.The five-day chart of STMP below offers yet another dramatic example of a gap down after a bad quarterly release.This often comes as a painful surprise to investors who haven't experienced a gap down in price before, but if you had a stop order or a limit sell order to sell your STMP shares at, say, $160, you wouldn't have gotten out at $160 on Friday, because the stock never traded at that price then. You would have been down more than 52%, assuming you got out at the highest price STMP traded at on Friday.Although stop orders wouldn't have helped here, hedging would have. Here's an example of that. Last Thursday, this was the optimal collar to protect against a >20% drop in Stamps by mid-August, while not capping your possible upside at less than 16% by then (screen capture via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app).The cost of the put leg here was $6,700, or 6.76% of position value, calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts (in practice, you can often buy and sell options at some price between the bid and ask). But the income generated by selling the call leg was slightly higher: $6,850, or 6.92% of position value, calculated conservatively, using the bid price of the calls. So the net cost of the hedge was negative on Thursday, meaning you would have collected a $150 net credit, assuming, conservatively, that you bought the puts and sold the calls at the worst ends of their respective spreads.Here's an update quote on the put leg of the collar (screen captures via the CBOE):And here's an updated quote on the call leg:Stamps.com closed at $198.08 on Thursday, Feb. 21. A shareholder who owned 500 shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had $99,040 in STMP shares, $6,700 in puts, and if the investor wanted to buy-to-close the short call position, it would have cost him $6,850. So, the net position value on Thursday was ($99,040 + $6,700) - $6,850 = $98,890.Since Stamps.com closed at $83.65 on Friday, Feb. 22, the investor's shares were worth $41,825, the put options were worth $38,425, and it would have cost $400 to buy-to-close his calls, using the midpoint of the spread in both cases (in reality, it would likely have cost less than $400 to close out the calls, since there were no bids on it, but we'll use $400 to be conservative here). So: ($41,825 + $38,425) - $400 = $79,850. $79,850 represents a 19.2% drop from $98.890.Instead of being down about 57.77% on Friday, Stamps.com shareholders hedged with the collar above were down about 19.2%. This makes a huge difference in terms of what it takes to get them back to even. Let's say both a hedged and an unhedged STMP investor exited their positions on Friday. The unhedged investor would need a 73.1% gain in his next investment to recoup what he lost in Stamps.com, but the hedged investor would only need a 23.8% gain on his next investment to get back to even."
4243841,99986,2019-02-25T10:19:03-05:00,"While bottom-fishing can work for some, I've learned to respect the 200-day moving average.Stocks below their 200-day moving average while the market is above it are the definition of laggards and should be avoided in most cases.Stamps.com may have come as a huge surprise to some, but a simple 200-day moving average filter would have kept proactive traders out of it.","In a week that's been a nightmare for Stamps.com's (NASDAQ:STMP) investors and traders, it's worth sending out a reminder about how a simple indicator can save you a lot of grief. While many people chalk technical analysis up to simply voodoo and don't bother to pay attention to charts, there is one paramount piece of technical analysis that many fundamental investors should have in their repertoire. This tool is the 200-day moving average, and it has allowed me to steer far clear of most big blow-ups over the past decade-plus. It may seem silly to think that a simple line on a chart can predict problems before they show up, but the indicator is not a predictive indicator at all. The best use of the 200-day moving average is to keep an investor away from growth stocks trading below it, as downside surprises typically happen below this moving average. It is no surprise that the 55% decline in a single day on Stamps.com occurred below the 200-day moving average, and it isn't a surprise that the Windstream (WIN) blow-up Monday also happened below there. These moves typically happen when stocks are in their own individual bear trends, and the 200-day moving average is designed to be an objective way to display when a stock is in a bear trend of this sort.(Source: TC2000.com)Going through the comments on a couple of different stock boards yesterday and on Twitter, there seems to be a significant amount of investors who were blindsided and surprised by the Stamps.com plunge. While this may have come as a surprise for those that don't look at charts, there's been absolutely no reason to be long Stamps.com since it lost its 200-day moving average on September 26th last year. Many investors don't realize that many of the smarter institutions are like sharks that can smell blood well ahead of time in a company. These funds will sell out their positions defensively when things start to look less favorable for a stock and well ahead of having confirmation that there is a problem. The 200-day moving average is an individual investor's way of getting the memo early that something may be wrong, and this is why prudent investors pay close attention to it. Just because a stock drops beneath its 200-day moving average doesn't mean that it has to crash or trouble is ahead, but stepping aside is never a bad idea. Stocks rarely crash from their highs. Instead, they tend to implode while they are already in bear markets. The same sell signal showed up in Lehman Brothers, Enron, and many other stocks well ahead of their collapses, and paying attention to the 200-day moving average would have saved investors billions. Don't believe me? Take it from arguably one of the better traders of the past century, Paul Tudor Jones.(Source: TC2000.com)(Source: Tradingview.com)Paul Tudor Jones was interviewed by Tony Robbins and said something that I believe is extremely underrated that most market participants are not aware of. The following excerpt is from that interview:(Source: ""Trader"" Documentary with Paul Tudor Jones)What Paul Tudor Jones is essentially explaining above is that when an asset class or stock falls below its 200-day moving average, it's time to play defense. For me, this means not even entertaining ideas that are trading under the 200-day moving average. I'm sure I will get a rebuttal or two about how XYZ stock was a great buy under the 200-day moving average, and how ABC stock was also a great buy under the 200-day moving average and why this rule is wrong.There are always instances when a rule does not work perfectly, and times when buying below the 200-day moving average has paid off. The point is that the majority of the time it is not a winning strategy and is much riskier than most people are aware. Several thousand people daily text while driving and manage to get away with it, but this still doesn't make it a good idea. While a disastrous investment choice does not have severe ramifications that texting while driving can, it can be fatal to your portfolio's health. This is why I made the decision a long time ago to avoid investments under the 200-day moving average. Sure, they can work out once in a while, but the odd loser from this strategy far outweighs the winners when you get stuck in a Stamps.com plunge. Gold bugs know this too well when it comes to names like Eldorado Gold (NYSE:EGO) and New Gold (NYSEMKT:NGD), which are down 95% from their all-time highs in what's been a slow-motion car wreck for investors.(Source: TC2000.com)(Source: TC2000.com)It's no coincidence that the three most notable blow-ups last week all occurred with the stocks below their 200-day moving average before the real pain occurred. Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), Windstream and Stamps.com were stocks in bear markets while the market is in a bull market, and these serial laggards under the 200-day moving average, while the market is above its 200-day moving average, are typically your worst spots to park money.So what's the current picture look like for Stamps.com after the stock shed nearly 60% of its value last week? Let's take a look:From a fundamental standpoint, Stamps.com's earnings trend has been completely obliterated shown by the table below. As we can see, annual earnings per share are expected to nosedive from $11.78 in FY-2018 to $5.43 for FY-2019. This is a more than 50% drop year over year, and even if the company does meet estimates for 2020 of $7.28, it's not going to fix what is now an uptrend under pressure in EPS. We can get a better look at this in the chart below the table:(Source: YCharts; Author's Table)(Source: YCharts; Author's Chart)From a revenue growth standpoint, there's also some concern as the company is now expecting FY-2019 revenues of $555 million as a midpoint to its guidance. This is a 5% drop over FY-2018 revenues, which came in near $587 million. Clearly this was not factored in at all by analysts who were expecting revenues for FY-2019 of closer to $690 million.Moving to the technicals, the quarterly chart of Stamps.com has now come under pressure. The stock is now sitting below its key quarterly moving average (blue line) which comes in at $121.20, and a close below here to finish Q1 would be the first close below this level since the uptrend started eight years ago. The stock has also broken below its uptrend line which comes in near $108.00; therefore, a close below either of these levels to finish March will mark a turning point in the stock.(Source: TC2000.com)On the weekly chart, we can see the stock broke below its key weekly moving average in September, has been unable to reclaim it, and now has broken an 18-month horizontal support level near $150.00. This is all occurring on the highest weekly volume to date for the stock - a sign that funds are heading for the exits, and fast.(Source: TC2000.com)While the stock could be due for a bounce technically after getting hit this hard, any rallies back up that cannot reclaim the $120.00 level on a quarterly close are just going to be noise. This means that even if the stock managed to rally 40% from here, it would still be within the confines of a new bear market.Based on the fundamentals for Stamps.com getting a massive hit this week with the share price, I have zero interest in the company from the long side. The market hates uncertainty, and this is the definition of the Stamps.com thesis after a 55% drop in annual EPS guidance overnight. Rarely is the first downward revision the last one in a scenario like this one. This is why I always step aside and let the dust settle after massive events like this. A stock selling off dramatically on the most significant weekly volume in its history is never a good sign as it typically marks the end of an uptrend. Investors can be coaxed into believing everything is fine after rallies of 30% or more from the lows, but usually, these bounces get sold into quickly.The takeaway from this article is that the biggest downside surprises typically happen under the 200-day moving average, and the warning signs are there if investors are willing to pay attention. For those who don't want to end up in this type of scenario in the future, a simple indicator like the 200-day moving average is the canary in the coal mine that something might be off with an investment. This doesn't mean exit every position that drops below the 200-day moving average; it doesn't mean one should short after the 200-day moving average breaks, it merely says that some defense should be played depending on one's risk tolerance. My tolerance for risk and draw-downs is low, so I don't bother with stocks under the 200-day moving average as it merely adds volatility and risk to my strategies and the upside does not justify it. Positive earnings surprises tend to happen with the strongest stocks above their 200-day moving average like Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN), and earnings ""demises"" tend to happen with the weakest stocks like Kraft Heinz and Stamps.com. If you prefer the former which tend to increase the value of one's portfolio, it's best to stick to stocks in uptrends."

It is a software company and their business are to provide convenient and cost-effective Internet-based services for mailing letters, shipping packages or parcels. The company derives its revenue from monthly service fees and transaction-related fees. A majority of the firm's revenue is generated in the United States.I liked Stamps.com business instantly, when I first read about it a couple years back, because:1) it is easy to understand what they do;2) its business is scalable (number of users and revenue can be increased on demand without much of additional costs;3) it has dominant position in its market with significant barriers to entry;4) it has lots of room to grow as it captured so far only about 2.5% of potential customers;5) it has attractive valuation. We view STMP stock price at current level of $190 as a BUY.Let’s look at these critical points in more details.1) Understanding what they doStamps.com was the first ever USPS-approved PC Postage vendor to offer a software only mailing and shipping solution in 1999. Basically, they developed a software that allows anyone who mail and send packages to optimize their shipping processing. The company grew organically and by acquisitions, buying potential competitors, capturing certain customers and market niches. They operate now through six wholly owned subsidiaries: Stamps.com, Endicia, ShipWorks, ShipStation, Shipping Easy, and recently acquired (in August of 2018) a United Kingdom based company MetaPack Ltd. Here is the company presentation picture that incorporates all subsidiaries (excluding the latest acquisition):Image source: Stamps.com corporate presentationThe listed subsidiaries and their software are differentiated on what customers they target, geography of the shipments, and what services they offer, with some overlapping of cause. For our analysis this per subsidiary differentiation is not material because their financials consolidated and presented on the single balance sheet.The universe of STMP customers include the following: individuals and home offices, enterprise mailers, eCommerce shippers, warehouses, fulfillment houses, online retails, small/large volume shippers, mostly domestic US customers, and some international. The international customer reach will most likely increase, especially after recent acquisition of MetaPack Ltd., a United Kingdom based company.The portfolio of services offered to STMP’s customers includes:USPS Mailing and Shipping Solutions – ship variety of mail pieces and packages through the USPS. Customers can purchase and print postage 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Proprietary software or web interfaces enable users to print “electronic postage” directly onto envelopes, plain paper, or labels using only a standard personal computer, printer and Internet connection. The solutions incorporate address verification technology that verifies each destination address for mail or packages sent using database of all known addresses in the United States. The solutions are also integrated with popular small business and productivity software applications such as contact and address management, and accounting and financial applications. The shipping solutions also allow for integrations with hundreds of partners and carriers including popular shipping management products, shopping carts, online marketplaces and other e-commerce solutions.Multi-Carrier Shipping Solutions – mostly for type of shippers that use multiple carriers such as the USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL and others. The solutions download orders from all selling channels and automatically map custom shipping preferences, rates and delivery options across all supported carriers helping merchants to streamline workflow and save on shipping costs, it also enables sending email notifications to buyers, updating online order status, generating reports and many more.Mailing and Shipping Integrations - offer back-end integration solutions where the solution provides the electronic postage for transactions to partners who manage the front-end users. The solutions integrate directly into the most popular e-commerce platforms, allowing web store managers to completely automate their order fulfillment process by processing, managing, and shipping orders from virtually any e-commerce source through a single interface without manual data entry. Integrations with partners include Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Shopify, Overstock, Bigcommerce, Yahoo! Stores and many others. Carrier integrations include USPS, FedEx, UPS, DHL, Canada Post, UPS Canada, FedEx Canada and many others.Described above USPS Mailing, Multi-Carrier Shipping and Integration solutions represent almost 90% of the company business by revenue.Mailing & Shipping Supplies Stores – It is on-line store available within mailing and shipping solutions and sell shipping labels, dedicated postage printers, scales, and other mailing and shipping-focused office supplies.Customized Postage - is a patented form of postage that allows to turn digital photos, designs or images into valid USPS-approved postage. With this product, clients can create customized USPS-approved postage using pictures of their children, pets, vacations, celebrations, business logos and more.Branded Insurance – it enables customers to insure their mail or packages in a fully integrated, online process that eliminates any trips to the post office or the need to complete any special forms. This insurance is provided by outside insurance providers.Why customers choose and stay with STMP services?Because they save time and optimize their shipping operations:- the solutions allow customers to easily access more than 30 domestic and international carriers from a single user interface;- customers can receive a discount of up to 39% compared to USPS.com or retail;- the multi-carrier solutions allow customers to optimize between carriers by selecting the lowest cost option based on package size, weight, destination distance and delivery times;- it allows online retailers and e-commerce merchants to organize, process, fulfill and ship their orders quickly and easily;- the solutions enable larger enterprises to have greater visibility and control over shipping expenditures across their distributed network of locations.How customers pay for STMP service?In the financial reporting company classifies its revenue into five sources. The Service revenue (1) is accounted for 87.8% of the company total revenue. It earned from customers paying a monthly fee based on subscription plan, compensation from USPS under partnership agreements, transaction related revenue based on customers purchasing postage or printing shipping labels. Company also earns compensation by offering customers a discounted postage rate that is provided to the customers by integration partners. Product revenue (2) is primarily driven by sale of labels, and accounts for 4.4% of total revenue. Insurance (3) is 3.7% of revenue. Customized postage (4) is 4.1% of total revenue.To sum up: about 90% of Stamps revenue comes from Subscription to its software + Fraction of USPS discounts that have not been passed to the customers.Stamps revenue is subject to seasonal variation where the fourth calendar quarter is typically seasonally stronger due to the holiday shipping.2) Its business is scalable.Scalability of Stamps business is easy to understand: to serve any additional client all you need is for client to sign up for the service using internet connection. There is no additional capital spending required. Company’s cost of revenue principally consists of the cost of customer service, promotional expenses, system operating costs, and credit card processing fees. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was quite a steady number of approximately 13% for the last two years.Scalability of the company business is also reflected in high gross margins, significant fixed cost leverage, low working capital requirements and strong free cash flow generation that could be observed through analysis of the financial statements. From the table below, it is easy to see quite steady operating margin increase from 9% in 2010 to 40% in 2017. The data used in calculations was taken from Value Line report.3) It has dominant position in its market with significant barriers to entry.In the Stamps Corporate Fact Sheet there is a bullet point that company “operate in a very large addressable market with significant barriers to entry”. Such barriers allow company to do what potential rivals cannot – thus creating competitive advantage for Stamps. The easiest to see barrier for entry is that you need to be a USPS-approved PC Postage vendor. There are only a few approved companies to sell USPS postage.Some potential shipping software competitors, like Harvey Software, have to partner with Stamps (through Endicia) to sell Internet postage, some other competitors just went out of business. Along with selling PC postage, this limited number of approved companies including Stamps also offer postage discounts from USPS, giving them unfair cost advantage in comparison to pure shipping software companies. According to Washington Post, more than 1,000 shippers have gotten deep discounts by negotiating directly with the Postal Service for deals, the details of which are not made public.Because Stamps has such a large number of customers it also has ability to bundle them and offer volume-based postage discounts to smaller shippers who would not get the discount if they went directly to USPS or use shipping management software other than the Stamps’.Stamps ability to pass to his customers volume-based discounts is based on particularities of the current USPS “re-seller” program, which, unfortunately, is now under review and the new changes could have adverse effect going forward. This “review” is largely to blame for STMP’s recent stock price decline.According to Washington Post, Stamps provides postage to one-third of Priority Mail, the most profitable and lucrative part of USPS business, also according to several industry officials if USPS will eliminate discount program it will be able to collect additional $100 million dollars per year. If we assume that third of this USPS savings would come as Stamps loss, I would very roughly estimate maximum possible impact on Stamps income to be approximately of $15-25 million per year, reducing expected net income in the worst-case scenario by 10% - 15%. Amazon also has similar discounts from USPS, and its agreement recently, on Trump personal initiative, went through “review”, and there was no evidence found that Amazon takes advantage of the US Postal Service. On last conference call in October, Stamps management sounded skeptical this “review” will have immediate impact on company business.On other hand, Stamps had enjoyed this “unfair” advantage for long and build the largest customer and partnership base. That customer and partnership base and synergy associated with it will not go away even if the price-discount advantage from USPS will fade. In the company Corporate Fact Sheet management assess that “based on current information available from the US Postal Service, we believe that we have over 80% of the total PC Postage subscription customers”. On conference call for 4Q 2017 company management estimates that “more than 1/3 of all U.S. priority mail packages and more than 1/2 of all first-class mail packages in the U.S. are processed through our systems”. I think this evidently confirms domination of Stamps software on the market.Barriers to entry is not the only factor that provide competitive advantage to the company. Stamps also compete on the basis of technology and innovation; breadth of product offerings, ability to design and tailor solutions to specific client needs, quality and brand. In the slide below company summarized how its service/solutions compares to alternatives offered by competition:Image source: Stamps.com corporate presentationThe main Stamps competitor is Pitney Bowes (market cap $1.32 Billions), others are EasyPost which are USPS-approved PC Postage Providers, and Shippo which is an approved USPS ePostage provider. Stamps management believes that customers choose Stamps over those of other PC Postage providers because of superior user interface, larger breadth of features, extensive partner integrations and quality of customer service and support. For example, Stamps support more address books than any other PC Postage software, it is also the only mailing and shipping service that is tightly integrated into the native capabilities of Microsoft Office.Stamps high return (over 15% - 25%) on invested capital over the last 10 years is a clear evidence of the presence of competitive advantage:Data is from Value Line4) It has lots of room to growStamps addresses need of any mailers and shippers but especially e-commerce. This market is very large and still new with e-commerce sales growing at 16% annually. Company estimates that there are potentially over 30 million customers out of which Stamps serves only 740 thousand, it is just about only 2.5%! Here is a slide from company presentation illustrating addressable market:Image source: Stamps.com corporate presentationStamps recent growth initiatives that have been in the news and that confirm the company is keeping on the fast-growing track:March 2018 – the company has launched its Amazon Seller Suite, an unmatched bundle of solutions for every serious Amazon seller.April 2018: ShippingEasy has been named the preferred shipping provider for AmeriCommerce, a full-service e-commerce solution provider that gives customers everything they need to design and operate a successful online storefront.April 2018: ShippingEasy has integrated with Bonanza, a fast-growing online marketplace of approximately 28 million items that empowers entrepreneurs to create a sustainable online business.May 2018: ShippingEasy has integrated with Reverb, the leading online marketplace dedicated to buying and selling new, used, and vintage music gear.July 2018: ShippingEasy, has integrated with Wish, the sixth largest e-commerce company in the world that is revolutionizing mobile e-commerce.June 2018: Webgility—the leader in ecommerce and accounting automation solutions and Stamps.com have signed an agreement to deliver shipping technology and discounted shipping rates to Webgility users.August 2018: it has completed its acquisition of MetaPack Ltd., a United Kingdom based company that provides the world’s leading multi-carrier enterprise-level solution to many of the world’s preeminent e-commerce retailers and brands. The company's software is using more than 450 different ""parcel carriers"" operating in more than 200 countries around the world, it generated revenue of about $47 million and gross margin of about 87% in the last year.August 2018: ShipWorks Integrates with Overstock.com, the billion-dollar online home goods and furniture retailer that sells a broad range of products at low prices.October 2018 ShippingEasy is integrating its shipping software with Amazon’s Alexa devices for order-fulfillment tasks like orders, label printing, and postage rate checks.It is also important that organic growth and acquisitions would have good “quality” – increase in customer retention (measured as decrease of customer churn rate) and increase of revenue per customer. Stamps reporting shows that these parameters do improve:Image source: Stamps.com corporate presentationI wish we could compare these Stamps numbers with competitors but unfortunately, they do not report them.Another note worth mentioning is that growth of customers is important but not all customers equally profitable. Stamps at this point is focusing on large customers whom they can offer shipping integration, that makes switching costs for customers higher. It is also increasing Stamps customer acquisition costs and depresses profit margins, but in the longer term such customers should generate higher revenue and profit margins. From 2015 till 2017 average monthly revenue per customer increased by over 70%.The major risk to growth is that so much of Stamps business is build around USPS. USPS is the largest postal company in the United States, it is basically a monopoly in many mailing niches, and subsidized by government - there is no way for anybody to go around it. So, if USPS will make any market changing moves (canceling volume discounts, rising prices etc.) it will affect everybody, and on a relative basis, Stamps would have better chances to survive.5) It has attractive valuation.All above points were to establish that Stamps is a “wonderful business” and now is the turn to se if it has a reasonable price. We will use Grinold-Kroner model to get the feeling of what return we could expect from Stamps. The model requires a few inputs: (1) expected dividend (zero in our case), (2) nominal earnings growth, (3) change in shares outstanding, and (4) expected change in P/E ratio. We will justify every input number below. Here is the model description from Wikipedia.org:(1) Company does not have known plans to pay dividend, so we assume dividend term in the model to be zero. Though, in 2002 company did pay a special dividend of $107 million.(2) (i + g) is nominal earnings growth. For earnings growth we use analyst estimates, because we believe it is the best estimates available. During last five years Stamps earning growth was 51%, and its closest competitor Pitney Bowes Inc had earnings growth for last 3 years of -9.28%. At this point, analysts’ consensus for STMP is 15% for 5-year earnings growth (see Yahoo! Finance or Value Line).(3) The company claims returning excess cash to shareholders, and in financial statements we could see these numbers:Here is statistic of outstanding shares from company 10k report:We can see from this table there are no substantial dynamic in decrease of outstanding shares. Company grants a lot of options to its employees, many of which are will be converted in stock at below market price, creating additional employee compensation expense that is not shown on income statement or balance sheet. The loss of buying shares at market price when they were just issued at option exercise price below the market could be backed out from tax benefit from the loss. In August conference call company made disclosure:Professional financial analysts incorporate that expense in their earnings forecasts.In our opinion, Stamps shares repurchase benefit is offset by equity compensation thus, we assume zero for changes in shares outstanding.(4) Over its history Stamps showed quite a volatility of its P/E. In March of 2016 its P/E reached 469! Here is the graph from Seeking Alpha stock valuation feature:Image source: SeekingAlpha.comWe do believe Stamps is growing company and deserve P/E above market averages. Recently, in September, Stamps.com was named to Fortune Magazine's List of 100 Fastest-Growing Companies, it is the second-highest ranked company on the 2018 list that included technology leaders such as Facebook, Amazon, GrubHub, and Netflix. To be conservative, we use Value Line estimate P/E ratio of 28 for 2019/2020 and make assumption that it will start decreasing in 5 years after 2023.Here are our calculations:Based, on our analysis we believe STMP stock position should provide approximately 20% annual return over the next five years if purchased now at price of about $190. For risk management purposes we allocate about 3%- 5% of portfolio in this position. Please, remember if the new material information comes out, it will trigger our model re-evaluation. If price will go up too fast you should shorten holding period if there is no revision up in value.References:Stamps.com corporate presentation: https://investor.stamps.com/static-files/090c7019-1186-4296-9745-38aef1d31b90Investor Relations | Stamps.comStamps.com Named to Fortune Magazine's List of 100 Fastest-Growing CompaniesAs U.S. Postal Service struggles, Stamps.com fortunes rise"
4189540,24992,2018-07-24T13:57:54-04:00,"The Momentum Growth Quotient for the company is 16.18, which is 57.4% higher than the average for the S&P 100.Shares present a forward rate of return of 20.67% at current price.The company has a formidable business moat, but there is an inherent political risk in owning the shares.ChartMasterPro upward target price of $310.00.","Shares of Stamps.com Inc (STMP) are up 62.30% since bottoming on December 1, 2017, and in my opinion, the shares of this provider of internet-based postage solutions still have more upside going forward. The company has a solid history of generating excellent earnings growth, and the future growth ratios point to continued earnings growth. I lay out my bullish argument for the company below by reviewing some pertinent fundamental and technical aspects of the stock.Over the last few months, I have developed a new approach for my fundamental analysis of stocks: the Momentum Growth Quotient (MGQ). The MGQ is the key metric that I use to gauge the financial health of a company and its potential future growth prospects. The MGQ is calculated using the following company financial data:The goal is to generate a single number, which summarizes the relative fundamental strength and future growth prospects for a company compared to an index. For the index, I use the S&P 100 - this index provides a wide swath of companies from different industries representative of the broad US economy. I update the Momentum Growth Quotient for each company in the S&P 100 every month and then use the average quotient as my baseline to compare the relative financial strength of individual companies.As of the end of June, the average MGQ for the S&P 100 was 10.28. So, if a company has an MGQ of 12.00, its individual future growth prospects are around 20% higher than the index. If a company has an MGQ of 8, its future growth prospects are around 20% lower than the index.The MGQ plays a critical part when it comes to determining if I am going to go long or short a stock. Generally, I only want to go long a stock with an MGQ higher than the index, and I want to go short a stock with an MGQ lower than the index.The MGQ for STMP as of the end of June was 16.18, which implies a 57.4% higher growth rate compared to the S&P 100. This tells us that STMP has strong future growth potential and is a good candidate for a long position.Let's dig a little deeper into the financial data to get a better feel of how the company has performed on certain fundamental metrics and what these numbers imply for future growth.The PastDuring the past 12 months, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate of Stamps.com Inc was 28.30% per year. During the past 3 years, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate was 78.70% per year. During the past 5 years, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate was 35.50% per year. During the past 10 years, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate was 29.10% per year (GuruFocus). The company has been able to grow earnings at an impressive rate over the long-term, and earnings growth over the last twelve months remained robust.The operating margin % for STMP came in at a 36.84% as of March 2018. Each dollar of revenue the company generated brought in 36.84 cents of earnings. The company's operating margin came well above for the average of 17.20% for the SP500, and the company's operating margin % also compares favorably within its industry of online-software providers, which has an average operating margin % of 24.60%.The FutureKnowing how a company has performed in the past is important in order to evaluate management's past record in running the business. But more important to us is how profitable the company will be in the future because we are investing going forward, not backwards. And it's the forward-looking metrics that should really get you excited about STMP.I like to use two measuring sticks to gauge the future growth potential for companies: Forward P/E and forward rate of return.There are several ways to interpret a company's Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E). One approach is to look for companies that have a lower P/E compared to other companies in similar sectors - the rationale being that the lower the P/E, the more a company is being undervalued by the market, hence, the more value you are buying for every dollar invested. This makes a low-P/E stock a good value, but there is also the other side of the coin - it can also indicate that investors aren't very confident about the company's prospects.I prefer to use Forward P/E (current stock's price over its ""expected"" earnings per share) to gauge a company's expected future earning power. A high Forward P/E ratio means that investors are anticipating higher growth in the future and are willing to pay more for future earnings - momentum investing is all about following the trend (perceived or real).STMP has a Forward P/E of 27.40 compared to a 17.29 Forward P/E for the S&P 100. The Forward P/E for STMP is 40% higher than that of the index, indicating that investor growth prospects for the stock are higher than that of the broader market, and thus they would be willing to pay more for the higher growth prospects of the shares.The forward rate of return for a stock (created by Donald Yacktman) is one of my favorite quotients for gauging the market's expectation for future growth for a company. Yacktman defines forward rate of return as the normalized free cash flow yield plus real growth plus inflation. In simple terms, the forward rate of return can be thought of as the return that investors buying the stock today can expect from it in the future.The forward rate of return for STMP stands at 20.67%. This implies that an investor buying the stock today should expect a 20.67% return over the next 12 months. The average forward rate of return for the S&P 100 stands at 9.68%, so STMP has an implied potential rate of return that is 2.13x greater than that of the index.The risk inherent in the forward rate of return is that the calculation is reliable only if the company can grow at the same rate in the future as it did in the past. If the growth rate falters, the projected returns will not materialize. But we are willing to accept this risk as part of the difficult process of forecasting earnings and growth momentum.As per our ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the momentum trend for STMP would turn bullish with a break above $275.00 level. This would signal a bullish breakout above a bullish flag pattern on the daily charts. From here, we see the shares climbing to the $310.000 level over the next three months.Today, we will buy the STMP 17AUG18 260 Call Options, which will provide us with approximately 7x leverage on our long trade. Our stop-loss exit signal for the trade will be a daily close below $263.00. When trading options with leverage, a stop-loss is absolutely imperative in order to avoid oversized losses and wipe-outs.For investors in the shares, we recommend that you hold for 3 months or $310.00, whichever comes first. For longer-term investors, I believe STMP is a solid addition to any growth portfolio over the next 12 months.The moat for the Stamps.com business model is the negotiated service agreements it has in place with the United States Postal Service which allow the company to sell postage to its customers at a discounted rate. In 2015 STMP bought Endicia for $215 million, and added high volume shipping technology and expertise to its basket of services. In 2017 Stamps.com, and its subsidiaries ShipWorks, ShippingEasy, and ShipStation, sold postage for roughly one-third of the 1 billion US Postal Service Priority Mail shipments.The exact details of the negotiated service agreements are not publicly known, but the numbers speak for themselves: with a gross margin of 80.89% (March 2018) and a net margin of 35.22% (GuruFocus), this company is a veritable cash generating machine. The company's cash reserves have more than double in four years, climbing from $66.67 million in 2013 to $153.9 million in 2017. And a glance at the company's Q1 2018 numbers show that both revenue and earnings growth remain strong: on a Y/Y comparison revenue was up 27.2% and net income was up 29.6%. But all is not rainbows and sunshine for the company . . . there are some storm clouds forming on the horizon.On June 21 the shares of STMP dropped 10% when the White House announced a proposal to revamp the US Postal Service. Although no details were included in the announcement, just the suggestion of a change to the status quo sent the market running from Stamps.com.The biggest risk to the business model is that if the company loses its negotiated service agreements with the US Postal Service, its profit margins would shrink catastrophically.Some industry officials (who wanted to remain anonymous) estimated that the US Postal Service could collect an additional $100 million more in revenue per year if the negotiated service agreements were ended. On the other side of the argument, Stamps.com states that the agreements have allowed the US Postal Service to compete with FedEx and UPS and retain customers from these rivals. As the debate rages on, Stamps.com continues to rake in the cash.But one stroke of the Presidential pen could bring the whole business model tumbling down - what to do?The combination of the strong full year 2018 company guidance and my high MGQ for the company give me the confidence to go long the shares over the short-term via call options. But if you want to own the shares longer term and protect yourself from potential political risk, one strategy would be to go long the shares and at the same time buy at-the-money put options (this is called a married put) - this would offer some downside protection for your long position.When I go long a stock, I want to invest in a company that provides superior future growth potential, but I also want to time the entry into any position to try to maximize my return.So, I use fundamental analysis to identify shares with a strong future growth rate, and then I apply technical analysis to identify ideal entry points.In my opinion, STMP is a good buy at these levels from both a fundamental and technical perspective."
4182906,104163,2018-06-20T14:12:14-04:00,Stamps.com is positioned for outperformance as platform metrics (ARPU) continue to improve.Management's recent strategy of expanding the capability and reach of their software services through acquisitions has been overwhelmingly successful.Stamps.com is an undervalued growth stock in one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy.,"For those who are new to this company, Stamps.com (STMP) provides online postage printing solutions to approximately 740,000 businesses. Their software solutions can scale to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes and stages in their own development. Through a string of recent acquisitions, they've expanded the capability of their software suite, creating a sticky platform that encourages higher spending per user. We believe that strategic acquisitions and secular e-commerce growth create several avenues for expansion moving forward.We expect continued growth in revenue, driven in part by improvements in average revenue per user (ARPU) metrics, and greater customer acquisition and retention. Additionally, a strong balance sheet and growing cash flows indicate that the firm can accelerate its buyback program while continuing its efforts in M&A.Much of Stamps' growth is dependent on the acquisition and retention of small but rapidly growing e-commerce firms. Although the churn rate (the rate at which commercial customers terminate their use of a given service) among this demographic is higher than larger clients, successful businesses will look to expand their relationship with Stamps as their business and shipping needs grow. This is a similar to that of Shopify’s (NYSE:SHOP) business model, where a high turnover of small customer accounts is expected, in the hopes that successful companies are able to scale with the platform and contribute significantly to revenue in the future. Stamps' ability to meet, and monetize, the needs of rapidly growing small businesses remains crucial for the long-term success of the company.As e-commerce businesses expand, software companies compete to win over clients with various incentives and advertised improvements in the functionality of their services. Stamps.com, again similar to Shopify, wishes to be the sole platform that a business of any size would need in order to fulfill their postage needs. This strategy is two-pronged. First, a business at any stage of its development may begin using Stamps' services. In addition to small business' activity on Stamps.com being ably scaled, it is also encouraged; high volume clients and corporations are incentivized with advanced software functions, data tracking, and discounted postage fees. Stamps also offers these larger clients direct integration with their own order database in order to streamline each company's fulfillment process and e-commerce businesses can also take on a more professional appearance by integrating their logo into a chosen label design. With respect to this last feature, custom postage is one of Stamps’ fastest growing business segments, and although such services aren’t exclusively available to business customers, retail customers, for example, can add family photos to stamps, the expansion of business-oriented services is key.(Stamps.com)Stamps’ foray into servicing the needs of larger clients has led them to develop services which are similar to that of a traditional software as a service (SaaS) company. Their software allows businesses to manage and track postage expenses at all store locations and break down spending figures by categories of postage and special services. Additionally, employee access to printing services can be managed and controlled on an individual basis, allowing selected members of management to restrict postage allowance by class and volume. By making their software package flexible enough to meet the needs of all levels of employees within a business, Stamps is poised to become the go-to postage provider for growing e-commerce businesses.While Stamps may not have a robust technological moat, this shouldn’t be the root of relevant concern for investors. In every practical sense, their moat can be described as their ability to retain customers with growing business needs. By targeting a wide variety of businesses, they remain protected insofar that they can deliver economically priced service packages over narrow vertically integrated platforms which advertise a number of business management tools towards niche audiences with higher costs.(Stamps.com May 2018 Presentation)Mergers and acquisitions are key to this long-term strategy for growth and customer retention. Endicia offers solutions to businesses looking to streamline their postage usage, especially for those with high volumes of shipping. Their services integrate with hundreds of e-commerce software services to ensure customers can use Stamps regardless of the platform they use to process and fulfill orders. ShipStation was acquired by Stamps in mid-2014 and brought with it much needed enhancements in functionality to the ecosystem. Their services support the printing of labels from over 30 domestic and international carriers, ideal for e-commerce stores looking to expand their operations overseas. The software is currently integrated with nearly 200 well known marketplaces, including eBay (EBAY), PayPal (PYPL), Amazon (AMZN), Etsy (ETSY), Square (SQ), and Shopify.These acquisitions have had the effect of expanding Stamps’ ecosystem to accommodate the needs of all businesses, adding thousands of customers with each acquisition. Management has clearly defined goals of remaining the leader of the shipping SaaS space. As cash flows continue to grow, we expect the acquisition of competing/synergistic businesses to grow in size and quality, in order to expand their customer relationship. As of the end of 2017, Stamps had $153 million in cash, and just $60 million in long-term debt with interest coverage of over 14x. Their strong financial health and growing cash flow means management can easily add leverage to support a larger deal capacity if an opportunity were to arise.(Stamps.com May 2018 presentation, annotated)These strategic acquisitions have had an overwhelmingly positive effect on average revenues per user (ARPU), as customers find more value in Stamps platform. By offering a more comprehensive suite of tools for growing businesses, they’ve also managed to shrink their customer churn rate by 28% over the past 7 years. We feel that this strategy is in its early stages, as Stamps’ substantial cash flow has only recently begun to materialize.We took a bottom-up approach to projecting Stamps' revenue, using ARPU and user growth to obtain our revenue projections through 2023. Over the past 3 years, the number of paid annual users grew at an annual rate of 12.3%. We view this as relatively sustainable, though we lowered our growth expectations slightly to 11.4% in order to match general e-commerce growth projections.(WCM Equity Research Projections)As we pointed out earlier, Stamps has been able to grow its ARPU substantially over the past 4 years as it has attracted larger businesses with its improved product mix. While we expect Stamps to continue acquiring competing firms using its growing cash flow, we expect a significant overall slowdown in ARPU growth when compared with recent years. This yields a weighted average of 9.4% CAGR. Supporting this is the fact that e-commerce sales are projected to grow from $409 billion in 2017 to $638 billion in 2022 (Statista.com), driven primarily from a growth in shipments from existing businesses. Baked into this seemingly high level of expected growth is our expectation that management will continue to improve the product mix while retaining a greater number of businesses.Discounting free cash flows to firm (FCFF), we have attained a price target of $352 (~24% upside) based on the above growth expectations to be fulfilled within a 12-month period. This price target is, of course, dependent on Stamps hitting our target of 1.2 million paid users by 2023, which we believe to be ambitious, but reasonable, based on recent growth acceleration. We continue to anticipate further M&A within the shipping and postage services sector, which could allow Stamps to reach our target at a faster pace than we're anticipating.Based on Stamps' research of its total addressable market, it has only reached 2.3% penetration. So long as management continues to execute in the way they've been, there's no indication of secular growth shortage. We've taken a small position in STMP, which we plan to add to as we continue research, but this looks like one of the more promising investments in e-commerce. Positioned long with Stamps remains a play on the continued growth of e-commerce and small business expansion, both of which are driven by late-cycle macroeconomic factors (surpassed potential GDP, nominal consumption increases, and diminished unemployment)."

The company has initiatives in place to grow organically. Stamps.com owns multiple sites that serve a variety of shipping needs for different niches. With a reasonable valuation and above-average revenue and earnings growth, I expect Stamps.com to outperform the broader market.Stamps.com is much more than the website bearing its name. The company also runs the following websites: Endicia.com, shipworks.com, shippingeasy.com, and shipstation.com. Each site has features for niche business needs with various price levels. The company's multiple offerings allow them to capture a variety of customers and to grow market share.Here is a breakdown of each site that the company owns and what they offer:Each site offers solutions for certain types of businesses depending on their needs. For example, businesses that are on-the-go may prefer Stamps.com or shipstation.com for mobile app management. All of them offer certain discounts on the cost of postage. The company prefers to maintain each site or brand separately, instead of combining features into fewer sites. This allows the company to offer the best solutions to customers that have specific needs.For example, shippingeasy.com has a broad range of services which include customer marketing and inventory management. The Stamps.com site is for businesses that only need USPS shipping rather than a need for multiple carriers. So, maintaining a variety of sites caters to specific business niches, which can help the company grow with a broader reach.STMP has initiatives in place to drive future growth. One of these is ramping up sales and marketing to acquire more shipping customers. The company achieves a high ROIC of about 28%. STMP experienced an increase in the average lifetime value of acquired customers. So, extra money invested in sales and marketing will help drive strong future growth.The company is also working on expanding features and functionality for customers. This includes increasing the number of integrations between sales channels, 3rd party fulfillment centers, e-commerce tools, and marketplaces. The more integrations the company has, the more valuable its platforms become for customers. Having all of the popular marketplaces such as Amazon (AMZN) stores, eBay (EBAY) stores, Shopify (SHOP) stores, etc. linked to the company's solutions broadens the potential customer base for future growth.STMP is developing new features for e-commerce customers. Inventory management and customer marketing were added in 2017. These features are being developed further in 2018 to create more value for customers. STMP charges extra service fees for these services, which allows the company to grow revenue.STMP is also expanding its international solutions. This initiative is called the Global Advantage Program and it allows customers to get discounts on international USPS rates and gives them access to the First Class International Envelopes and Flats shipping service which USPS no longer offers. The program also eliminates the need for customers to fill out custom forms.The Global Advantage Program makes Stamps.com more valuable for customers since it makes shipping internationally more convenient and cheaper. That can help STMP to increase revenue as customer volume being shipped internationally grows.STMP achieved a strong 28% increase in mailing/shipping revenue for Q1 2018. This was driven by growth in paid customers and average revenue per paid customer. The company's initiatives that are in place are likely to help drive strong growth for future quarters. The initiatives are designed to grow the number of customers and the revenue per paid customer. So, I think the company can build on the success that it is achieving.Consensus estimates are calling for revenue to increase 17% in 2018 and 17% in 2019. Those estimates could be too low. The company already achieved a 27% gain in total revenue for Q1 2018. STMP achieved a 29% increase in revenue in 2017 after achieving a revenue increase of 34% in Q1 2017. With the growth initiatives in place, STMP's revenue growth could easily exceed 20% in 2018.STMP also looks good on the earnings side. Original consensus estimates of $8.33 for 2018 EPS three months ago have been increased to $9.82. This is 20% higher than last year's EPS of $8.19. If the revenue estimates are too low, then the earnings estimates are also likely to be too low. Even if STMP meets the 20% EPS growth without exceeding it, that is still strong above average growth, which will catalyze the stock to grow at an above-average pace.STMP's trailing P/E of 30 and forward P/E of 22 don't look all that attractive by themselves. That's why I like to use the PEG ratio for companies with above average growth. The PEG ratio factors in the company's earnings growth rate.With the PEG at 1.63, STMP is trading at a reasonable valuation level for a high growth company. Stocks of the high growth companies that I cover typically continue to rise when their PEG ratios are below 2. I consider STMP's PEG to be a fair valuation considering the company's high double-digit earnings growth. At this valuation, the stock can reasonably increase approximately in line with earnings growth.Pitney Bowes (PBI) is the company's main publicly traded competitor. Pitney Bowes is trading with a higher PEG ratio of 1.88. At first glance, PBI looks attractively valued with a forward P/E of only 7. However, PBI has much lower growth than STMP, which is why I see the PEG ratio as the better comparison.PBI is expected to grow revenue at only 2% in 2018 and only by 0.30% in 2019 (consensus). EPS is expected to decline by about 16% in 2018. That is not much of a catalyst for strong stock growth.PBI's consensus EPS estimates for 2018 have been lowered over the past 3 months from $1.45 down to $1.17. This has been causing the stock to underperform. The good news for PBI is that the stock yields about 8%, which could attract income investors. However, I wouldn't expect much price appreciation for Pitney Bowes due to the declining earnings outlook. STMP is likely to outperform PBI on a price appreciation basis due to Stamps.com's strong above average growth as compared to PBI's below average growth.Amazon could take market share away from STMP over time. Amazon's order fulfillment service allows sellers to send their merchandise to Amazon's fulfillment centers. This saves sellers the hassle of shipping out their own products. The attractiveness of this service could cause Amazon to take market share away from STMP.With a reasonable valuation and strong above-average growth, STMP looks poised to outperform the broader market. Since the company offers a variety of shipping and e-commerce solutions at reasonable prices for customers, I don't think Amazon will take significant market share away. Amazon's fulfillment fees can run high. So, it won't make sense for many businesses to use.STMP's expected earnings growth of 20% is likely to be achieved or exceeded in 2018. The company's multiple growth initiatives will help drive strong revenue growth that is likely to exceed consensus expectations.With the stock's valuation at a fair level, I expect the stock to rise approximately in line with earnings growth. That means the stock could increase by about 20% over the next year. This would take the stock to about $298 within 12 months."

A marketing message now regularly caught in the spam filter has migrated to Facebook. Broadcast television commercials, outside of sports, are losing their potency as more people cut cords. Newspaper ads have almost become a thing of the past, just like first-class mail, whose volume dropped by more than half over a decade thanks to the use of email. However, mail service is not dead. One bright spot is still marketing mail, aka junk mail, which might just be the best way for less sophisticated businesses, especially local small businesses, to reach cord cutters and Millennials. Junk mail was responsible for 52.4% of United States Postal Service (""USPS"") mail delivery in 2016. The 80.9 billion marketing pieces, along with package delivery, were the only points of growth in the USPS' deliveries.Source: USPS Office of Inspector GeneralWith the shift to online retailing, package delivery has become almost a daily happening for households. E-commerce retail sales (B2C, business-to-consumer) are expected to continue to grow at near double-digits for the foreseeable future, driving a renaissance in the requisite logistics.Source: Statista.comHowever, often overlooked, the business-to-business (""B2B"") market is three times larger than B2C. Logistics software helps manage these deliveries, finding the cheapest rates, tracking inventory and status, and helping companies go global. The software also helps shippers deal with changes in delivery methods.Source: Shopify.com; Statista 2017 B2B Ecommerce ReportTroubling to delivery companies is the disruption in the ""last mile"". Drones, autonomous cars, Uber drivers, and a host of others are expected to take over delivery to homes over the next decade. This creates some uncertainty in logistic companies' business models but adds to the demand for flexible logistic software. Stamps.com Inc. (STMP) provides a host of brands and solutions to help customers of all sizes handle everything from single-piece mail to bulk enterprise delivery.Stamps.com, which ranked sixth last year in Forbes' Top 25 Fastest Growing Public Tech Companies, operates mostly as a subscription service. This model provides for steadier revenues, especially as the company makes positive inroads to decreasing churn. The company was able to retain greater than 97% of its clients in 2017 while growing sales 28%.Source: Stamps.com Company Presentation, February 2018Stamps.com does not really need to do anything new to continue its upward growth trajectory. Management's plan is to continue investing in and improving their current platforms with an additional focus on international shipping. They have acquired three companies since 2014, helping to expand its services to a broader base of customers, and increasing its hooks into e-commerce sites and shopping cart vendors (third-party integrations in the graphic below). Continuing to build out and homogenize their offerings, and spending on marketing across their newer segments, should help lower costs and add revenues.Source: Stamps.com Company Presentation, February 2018Profiting from the popularity of e-commerce can seem straightforward - buy into United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) or FedEx (NYSE: FDX). However, Stamps.com strips away all of that heavy infrastructure investment, providing investors with extremely high margins and a smoother ride if the economy falters. A number of companies, along with the major shippers, provide pieces of STMP's full-service solutions, but the only publicly traded peer that could be found is Pitney Bowes (NYSE: PBI). According to finbox.io, Stamps.com bests its most direct peer, plus FedEx and UPS, with gross and net margins of 83.1% and 32.1% respectively.Source: finbox.ioSTMP's profit metrics are also impressive. Returns on Invested Capital, Equity, and Assets are all above 20%. One note, do not put too much stock in the Peers column below. With few tradeable peers, other software service companies in the industry group are technically similar, but not great direct comps.Source: finbox.ioPeer comparisons generally provide helpful context for determining the relative valuation of a company. As noted earlier, Stamps.com is tough to compare. It is a software company whose customers range from individuals to large firms and has no pure public competitors. Rather than select companies within the software industry, direct and indirect competitors provide some extra context. However, more mature companies like UPS and FedEx will show a high growth firm like Stamps.com as relatively overvalued.Stamps.com's P/E and Forward P/E are higher than the selected peers, which is not surprising after its stock price gained 65% over the last year. However, the P/E compares favorably to the market. STMP's 22.3x multiple is lower than the S&P 500 (24.9x) and the NASDAQ 100 (25.8x). Pitney Bowes' lower P/E reflects expectations for low growth with forecasted long-term annual sales growth of 3.7%, according to finbox.io.Source: finbox.ioWhile its P/E looks healthy relative to the market, the company's price-to-sales ratio is elevated. The S&P 500 trades at 2.2x sales, less than a third of STMP's 7.2x. Projected long-term annual sales growth of 11.2% should help bring this multiple down over time but for now it one strike against the company.Source: finbox.ioOne of the better performing metrics is Enterprise Value/Free Cash Flow, where purchasing companies with lower multiples has yielded long-term outperformance. The ratio is the theoretical cost to purchase the company over the actual cash left over for investors. Free Cash Flow is more difficult to manipulate than earnings, which are often engineered by management. Indicative of FCF's honesty is that this multiple cannot be calculated for FedEx or UPS due to their negative free cash flow. Finding a market EV/FCF is tough, so to help put this multiple in context, we switch to its cousin: Market Capitalization/FCF, the inverse of Free Cash Flow yield. Market cap does not account for the debt, cash on hand, preferred shares, etc. that EV does, but this multiple allows for comparison to the S&P 500. STMP's 17.5x multiple is lower than the S&P 500's 23.8x and the Tech sector's 19.3x, both of which are based on data from 2017.Wall Street analysts believe in management's approach. Expectations for 2018 are a 16.7% jump in revenues, but a drop in EPS on tougher comps. Analysts are under the midpoint of company guidance, and STMP surprised by better than 28% in each quarter last year, so it is fair to assume that this positive trend will continue.Analysts currently see an upside of 29.6%. Finbox.io's Fair Value, a composite of nine individual valuation models, agrees with Wall Street in forecasting a 29.4% gain.Source: finbox.ioStamps.com is positioned well to grow as a provider of mailing and shipping services.

Stamps.com's portfolio of solutions operates under the brand names Stamps.com, Endicia, ShipStation, ShipWorks, and ShippingEasy. Stamps.com has historically operated predominantly in the United States, but has recently taken measures to up its game in international markets as well. Stamps.com was recognized by Fortune Magazine this Fall as one of the market's fastest growing companies. IMAGE SOURCE: STAMPS.COMFor investors who had the foresight and good fortune to get in early, Stamps.com has been an impressive investment. While most investors think of companies like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) when we talk about millionaire-maker stocks, Stamps.com is not terribly far behind. In fact, $1,000 invested in Stamp.com ten years ago would be worth $1.72 million today.At the same time, it is fair to point out that the stock price appreciation has not exactly been linear. That is especially true over the past three years. The chart below shows some of those wild swings. If you look below, you will notice that from March 2016 to March 2017, the stock went from $121 all the way down to $72, only to climb back to $125. Then, in the subsequent 18-month period, the stock experienced two huge short-term rises and equally pronounced short-term falls. The curious thing is the fact that both earnings per share and EBITDA rose at a fairly steady rate during that same time span. The key questions are why would share price fluctuate so wildly when key financial metrics have moved in a very consistent pattern, and more importantly, what does it mean to investors going forward?STMP data by YChartsWhile it is true that, for all high flying companies, there will come a time when growth rates will have to moderate, moderating growth does not tell the whole story here. When it comes to Stamps.com, investors have been very fickle, resulting in market overreactions to events that in hindsight could be called ""fake news"". Let's take a look at some of the market's overreactions (at least they seem like overreactions now) with regard to Stamps.com.Anything and Everything AmazonAny announcement involving Amazon seems to send other stocks in the related industry into a free fall. Amazon enters the grocery space, Costco (COST) drops. Amazon enters the pharmacy space, Walgreens (WBA) drops. Similarly, when Amazon unveiled plans that included the words ""shipping"" or ""postage"", skittish Stamps.com investors headed for the exits. The most recent Amazon announcements related to the industry came last November and February, the first leading to a huge drop in share price and the second leading to an 11% drop in the first two trading hours following the announcement.Pitney BowesPitney Bowes (PBI) didn't pull any punches about going right at Stamps.com with this announcement in May of 2017:This turned out to be a non-event and after an immediate 6% pullback, the market realized this headline for what it was, ""fake news"".Donny John IThe president, mostly targeting Amazon, had been ranting for a while about the US Post Office charging too little for its services. Thus, on August 9th, when it got out that the post office was looking to renegotiate its contract with Stamps.com, the stock dropped 14%. This had a lasting impact as the stock has dropped 30% of its value since that time and would need to rise 41% to reclaim pre-announcement levels.STMP data by YChartsDonny John IIA couple weeks back, the President, targeting China, announced plans to withdraw from the Universal Postage Union. President Trump cited unfair rates as the reason for the move and he has gotten broad support since the announcement. While this may not be bad news at all for the company, the stock dropped 8% on the news and has continued its decline since.To be fair, the entire decline is not the result of overblown headlines as profit growth is slowing, which has affected investor sentiment, especially after the most recent earnings report. That being said, the huge swings have been either unrelated or disproportionate to any changes in the fundamental performance of the company.The most significant recent development has been the acquisition of London based MetaPack, a software as a solution company that has a strong presence in the U.K. and continental Europe. This acquisition fits Stamps.com's plans to increase its international presence and appears, at least on the surface, to be a bargain. The company paid cash for MetaPack, and if the company's projections turn out to be accurate, the company will have gotten MetaPack for only 4-5 times sales.One of the criticisms of the company in the past has been the company tended to dilute shareholder value by increasing the number of shares outstanding. However, the company has recently increased its buyback activity and has recently authorized $90 million in new buyback dollars over the next six months. Those developments may be comforting to shareholders for a couple reasons. Firstly, the buybacks in the most recent quarter averaged $240 per share, which means management means the shares are worth at least 33% more than their current share price. In addition, if management buys back its full allotment of authorized shares in the next six months, 2.8% of the shares will be taken off the table (assuming a $180 share price), essentially offsetting the gain in share count over the last year.STMP Shares Outstanding data by YChartsI will start by saying by most common valuation measures, Stamps.com is not the cheapest stock on the market. A look below at a couple of companies in the shipping and postage business shows that both FedEx (FDX) and Pitney Bowes are cheaper.At the same time, while Stamps.com is essentially a shipping and postage company, it is different in nature than the above-mentioned companies and has never been valued the same way. Stamps.com is primarily a software company. It does not have physical trucks, garages, and other tangible items the other companies have. Therefore, considering both the company's growth trajectory and its rightful categorization as a software company, I would rather value the company in relation to its own historical valuation metrics.STMP PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAs a shareholder in 2013 and again in 2017-18 (I sold at $225), I can tell you that it was rare for the company to sport a PE of 20 or lower. Generally, the PE held in the mid to upper twenties. The chart below shows that not only is Stamps selling lower than it was a year ago, but all three metrics are also about 40% below where they were in early June.STMP PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsIf we can accept 20 as a fair price to earnings ratio, we can look ahead and set what appears to be a fair value for the stock. Using consensus estimates, and it is fair to note that the company has generally beat estimates, the fair value at the end of the year would be $212.60. By the end of 2020, a PE of 20 would yield a fair value of $243.60, a 37% premium to today's price.DATA SOURCE: YCHARTS CALCULATIONS BY AUTHORStamp.com is now trading over $100 below its 52-week high. And while there have been speculative headwinds, they remain just that, speculative. The company continues to perform well and has recently raised its full-year guidance. If you don't like non-GAAP EPS and revenue as telltale metrics, we could also look at EBITDA, which is up 8% YOY and 15% if you back out stock-based compensation.In the end, you have a company in a growing industry, and while it may not experience the explosive growth of the past, it does not have to. Stamps.com is now fairly valued as a value stock. I have confidence the company will meet its earnings estimates in the near future, and if it does and holds to a PE of 20, a 37% two-year gain is good enough for me. I don't own Stamps.com right now, but I will make a stock purchase in the next month and the company is on my short list of prospective buys. If you are a value investor, I believe Stamps.com should be on your radar as well."
4212609,104099,2018-10-18T19:20:54-04:00,"Whenever shares of Stamps.com are this inexpensive, the stock has a history of rallying nicely.In my view, this is very much a ""growth"" company that is trading like a ""value"" company. I think investors would be wise to take advantage of that disconnect.In addition, I offer an option strategy that presents investors the possibility of either collecting very healthy premium or buying these underpriced shares at an even great discount.","I confess to being a fan of Ben “The Hebrew Hammer” Shapiro, and listen to him whenever I want to gain some insight into the, shall we say, tumultuous political environment south of the border. During one of his recent podcasts, he was about to talk about the latest political drama, but first needed to talk about Stamps.com. I was intrigued by the fact that Stamps.com Inc. (STMP) dramatically improves productivity by reducing the hassle of postage. I like companies that enhance productivity for their customers, so I decided to look into the stock. At the time of writing, the shares are down about 10% for the year and look to be heading lower. I think now would actually be a good time to take a position in the company, and I’ll go through my reasoning by looking at the financial history here, and by reviewing the stock itself. I’ll also mention a specific options strategy that will allow investors to either pocket significant premium or buy the shares at an even lower price.Stamps.com is a leading provider of internet based mailing and shipping solutions in the United States. Customers of both Stamps.com and its wholly owned Endicia receive discounted rates on some packages relative to both USPS.com and USPS retail locations. Under the ShipStation, ShipWorks, and Shipping Easy Brands, customers access multi-carrier solutions to ship packages through multiple carriers, including the USPS, UPS, and FedEx.The company has completed two significant acquisitions over the past few years. On July 1, 2016, they completed their acquisition of ShippingEasy Group Inc. for $55.4 million. That same year, the company determined that they had achieved 100% of their earnings target for that acquisition. In November of 2015, the company closed a $215 million stock purchase sale for Endicia. In my view, this is a relatively simple business to understand.A quick review of the financial history here indicates that this is a growth company by any reasonable definition of the term. For example, revenue is up at a CAGR of about 29% over the past five years, and net income has grown at a CAGR of about 27% over the same time period.As I’ve said many times, nothing on Earth is perfect, and, of course, Stamps.com is no exception. The company has diluted shareholders continuously over the past five years. Shares outstanding has increased at a CAGR of about 2.75% over the past 5 ½ years. This is particularly troubling to me in light of the current valuation. I don’t like to see management sell shares when they are this inexpensive, so I hope that management stops this practice sooner rather than later.Turning to the capital structure, there is some debt that I’m not concerned about, but I feel a need to spend some time writing about because a large portion of it (72%) is due in 2020. As part of the company’s funding of the Endicia acquisition back in 2015, they entered into an agreement with a group of banks in November of that year for a term loan of $82.5 million and revolving credit facility for the same amount. Since then, the level of indebtedness has dropped at a CAGR of ~36%. Additionally, the company has approximately five times more cash on hand than debt outstanding. Finally, along with the decline in debt levels, the interest expense is about ⅓ of it was 3 years ago. All this leads me to conclude that there’s little risk from the capital structure here.Source: Company filingsAs I’ve said countless times, stocks can often act as poor proxies for the health of the enterprise that they supposedly represent. I’m glad of this, as this short term disconnect between the business itself and the stock is the source of profitable investing. In my style of investing, I want to identify those stocks that are inexpensive relative to their future cash flows. This isn’t a perfect approach, obviously (cash flows can dry up, stocks can get even more inexpensive), but I think my approach is superior to an alternative where the investor buys a “hot” stock because it’s gone up a great deal in price already. In my view, such an approach is basically gambling, predicated on a hope that you can get out ahead of the crowd when things inevitably go sideways. In any event, this means that I must write about the stock itself as a thing distinct from the actual business.Although as I’ve said, I think Stamps.com is an excellent business, an excellent business can be a terrible investment if the investor pays too high a price for it. For that reason, I must specifically answer the question of whether this stock is inexpensive or not. I would suggest that it is, given this chart.Source: GurufocusObviously the stock is currently trading near the low end of its price to free cash flow range. What’s even more interesting in my view is the fact that every time the stock has been this inexpensive in the past (the clumsily drawn red circles), the shares have since rallied nicely. It’s as if the market will tolerate the shares becoming only so cheap before the crowd piles back in and drives the shares higher. This relationship gives me sufficient confidence to buy at these levels.Although the confluence of growth business trading at low valuation is enough for me, I understand that some people may be less tolerant of risk (or reckless). With that in mind, I’d like to present what I think is a decent options strategy that benefits investors somewhat no matter which way things go. I’m specifically suggesting that people who might be long, but are still nervous would benefit by selling puts. If, as I suspect, the shares rally from these levels, the investor simply pockets the puts. If the shares fall in price from here, the investor will purchase at an even lower price than they’re currently trading for.In particular, I suggest shorting the February 2019 puts with a strike price of $180 , as they are bid at the time of writing at $12.70. Thus, if the shares rise from here, the investor simply pockets $12.70 for being willing to buy an excellent company at an even better price. If the shares continue to languish, the investor will pay a net price of $167.30 for the shares (i.e. 15% below the current price). I consider the risk-reward of this strategy to be reasonable.I think there’s much to recommend shares of Stamps.com Inc. In regard to their financial picture, apart from dilution, the company is blemish free in my view. At the same time, the stock of this growth company is trading at a very low valuation. Whenever it’s traded at the current valuation in the past, the shares have gone on to rally nicely. Given the pessimism surrounding the name, investors have access to a very nice trade in put options. I think price and value can remain decoupled for some time, but not permanently. In my view, investors would be wise to buy at these levels before price inevitably rises to match value here."

And then, on the heels of it, guiding down massively for 2019:So you probably think ""that’s the worst of it."" Sure, imponderables remain regarding Stamps.com’s customer reaction to new fees, as well as to possibly new business as Stamps.com shifts business away from USPS and toward other shippers.But what if I told you that no that isn’t yet the worst possible outcome? Indeed, this disaster doesn’t even yet hit at the center of Stamps.com’s business and margins? You’d probably be surprised, given all the carnage. And yet, that’s the truth. The biggest shoe is yet to drop.You see, what made Stamps.com rise from the ashes was not a direct contract with the USPS. Instead, as explained all the way back in 2016 on Prescience Point’s article titled “Stamps.com: The Software Valeant?” what really made Stamps.com’s business shine was taking advantage of USPS' postage reseller discounts.Indeed, most of Stamps.com’s strategy of buying more and more shipment volume was dictated by that strategy. The strategy was simply to buy as much mail traffic that was going to be handled by USPS as possible, and then skim a large profit margin by having the reseller discount be applied to it. That’s how Stamps.com ended up being able to make such claims as (in the Q4 2018 earnings conference call):What happened, to borrow a schematic from Prescience Point’s article, which was itself sourced from the Capitol Forum, was as follows:Now, even back then Prescience Point conservatively estimated that around 65% of Stamps.com’s EBITDA was coming from applying this scheme to more and more traffic. It could only have gotten “worse” since (though Stamps.com is also likely to have shifted volume to its own NSA so as to try and improve margins further).So why am I bringing back this bearish thesis, which you would now think had just materialized? Well, the reason is simple:That, my friends, is the biggest shoe in the room (that hasn’t dropped yet).This article won’t be boringly complex. I know because Stamps.com straight out said it in the earnings conference call. Here it is (bold is mine):So there you have it. Stamps.com lost its NSA with USPS, but it’s still earning the significant commissions that flowing mail traffic through resellers afforded it. Those extra gains, which Stamps.com gets by reclassifying small customers as volume shippers (through aggregation), still stands to be lost.Amazingly, given how Stamps.com has already reacted, and how far the hit to its guidance has been, the worst is yet to happen.The Stamps.com bearish thesis from years ago has yet to fully play out. The same scheme to skim a large profit margin from existing USPS mail traffic, by using USPS resellers, is still in place. Given its historical contribution, this shoe is likely as large or larger than the shoe you just saw dropping."

One that is riding a massive worldwide industry trend growing at over 20% rates worldwide (and at 15% in the U.S. alone). One that, due to regulatory barriers, has a very limited number of direct competitors - and even fewer serious ones. A firm with a 5-year compound annual revenue growth rate of 29%, and a 5-year operating earnings annual growth rate of nearly 38%! And of course, last but certainly not least, a stock that has returned its owners 352% over the past 5 years, annihilating the S&P 500's 72% return.Interested yet? Let's take a look at Quality Growth stock Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP).An Old But Novel ConceptStamps.com's success is made even more interesting by the simple, appealing, and - frankly - old concept that the company brings to the table.Do you know of anyone who likes going to the post office? I certainly don't. Lines are long and slow. Postal employees, who have to put up with disgruntled customers all day long, are not always the cheeriest lot. Even The Simpsons character Ned Flanders, laid back and un-offending guy that he was, admitted that he hated the post office! Who can argue with that?Given this, the idea of printable postage - where businesses can buy and print postage away from the post office - has always been an appealing one. Being able to weigh items and buy and print postage away from the post office saves a substantial amount of time and effort. Time and effort = lost profits in business.Before the Internet, the only way to do this was through postage meters, and essentially the only company with USPS approval to sell them was Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI).With the advent of the Internet, it was then possible to buy postage online and be able to print labels yourself. This is where Stamps.com comes in. Whether you are a small business, an online seller (through eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) or whatever), or a warehouse shipper, you set up an account with one of Stamps.com's services. This is a recurring monthly subscription model. They send you a scale and you get access to buy postage through their web-based service. With direct software integration, Stamps.com's service allows the shipper almost automatic postage payment and shipping label generation. All they have to do is print it, slap it on the package, and set it out to be picked up. It is a huge time-saver.""Triple R's"": Rising, Recurring RevenuesA wonderful aspect of Stamps.com's business model is that it is one of predictable, recurring revenues. It's also pretty great that they have been rising rapidly and should continue to do so for the foreseeable future!As mentioned, Stamps.com's offerings are web-based monthly subscriptions. Customers pay them month in and month out, creating a highly predictable level of cash flow. Since there is no real physical product here, there is very little physical plant needed to run the business, and thus very little capital expenditures. This allows impressive free cash flow margins exceeding 30%. The business is a ""cash cow"".Granted, some of Stamps.com's impressive revenue growth has come on the back of acquisitions. The firm purchased ShipStation and ShipWorks in 2014, and ShippingEasy in 2016, all of which added to the ability to integrate with more online retailing platforms and additional shippers beyond the USPS (such as FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS (NYSE:UPS)). 2015 saw the acquisition of Endicia, which represented Stamps.com's first foray into higher-volume shippers, as well as taking one of their primary competitors out of the market.However, there is plenty of opportunity for continued growth. Organic revenue growth this year is expected to come in at about 15%, and indeed the e-commerce industry worldwide continues to grow at a 20%+ annual clip. Management's 5-year revenue growth target is 20% per annum, driven by both market growth and new product and service offerings.Without a doubt, Stamps.com has the ""triple R's"" we love - rising, recurring revenues.A Sneaky Secure Economic MoatWith cash flows and low capital requirements like this business has, you would expect a deluge of competitors to come in and drive prices down to zero, ruining the business.But that hasn't happened, and is actually extraordinarily unlikely to happen.You see, I believe Stamps.com has a wide economic moat in the form of REGULATORY BARRIERS.If you think about it, allowing customers to print postage is almost the same thing as allowing them to print currency! Clearly this is not something the government wants people doing ""willy nilly"". As we mentioned before, Pitney Bowes built a dominant business by being the only major public company with the regulatory approval to sell postage meters. But in 1999, the USPS started its ePostage program, granting a select few companies the license to offer postage online. Only 3 companies - Pitney, Stamps.com, and Endicia - were granted licenses, creating a government-mandated oligarchy in the industry.You might expect the USPS to expand the program from there but... it hasn't. Those 3 companies remained the only license holders up until last year, when privately owned Shippo was granted a license after Stamps bought Endicia.There are a few reasons for this, and these same reasons are why I don't think it is likely there will be many more licenses granted. For one, the USPS offers these services as well, so granting a lot of licenses could hurt their bottom line - not good for an agency losing almost $6 billion a year. Also, the government does not want the hassle and cost of having to validate and audit a whole phalanx of license holders year in and year out. An ability to print currency is not something it wants to hand out at will.All of this essentially limits the competitive market for Stamps.com and protects their business. I do believe the USPS will grant ePostage licenses directly to the big platforms like eBay and Amazon, however I don't see this as a major risk because the biggest merchants cross-sell items on many platforms, where Stamps.com's one-stop integration is a huge advantage.Valuation and ConclusionAt a 5.5% earnings yield and a 5.1% free cash flow yield, Stamps is valued at about market average multiples. Total debt-to-equity is under 40%, and interest coverage is a non-issue, so financial health is perfectly fine.Warren Buffett always says he'd rather buy a ""great company at a good price"" than a ""good company at a great price"", and the former is what we have here. A market average valuation for a firm growing highly recurring revenues at 15-20% rates with strong regulatory barriers to entry looks enticing indeed. Stamps.com is an intriguing stock."
4124854,103866,2017-11-14T16:16:21-05:00,"Stamps.com is a fast growing company in an industry poised for growth.Stamps.com has a trusted brand.The recent earnings report resulted in widespread misinterpretation.The recent pullback has put the stock in ""value"" territory.A rebound is likely in the next six months.","Stamps.com (NASDAQ: STMP) is a leading provider of online postage and shipping solutions and operates primarily in the United States. The software-based company consists of five major brands including Stamps.com, Encidia, Shipworks, Shipstation, and Shipping Easy. Stamps.com was founded in 1996 and began trading on the Nasdaq exchange in 1999 but was relatively unknown in the investing world until the last three years. Even today its trading volume is just over 400,000 and unless you use their products, own shares, or own shares of a competitor, it is likely you don't know much about the company. In this article, I will explain my thesis as to why this is a company that is worth putting on your investing radar.In the interest of full disclosure, I will start by pointing out that I have had a vested interest in Stamps.com for some time. I owned the stock for about a year back in 2012 and sold for a very small gain and have kept tabs on it ever since. About a year ago, I initiated a new position and have since added to the position to the point where it is now my second largest holding, representing 12% my personal portfolio.Opinions on Stamps.com vary wildly, and that variance can be seen in its stock price action over the past couple of years. The chart below shows the outsized gains and losses stockholders have endured in the last couple of years, at least on paper. With significant skin in the game, I believe it is prudent to vet all the opinions, both bullish and bearish to determine which opinions carry the most weight and determine a strategy going forward. In the balance of the article, I will examine the most prevalent reasons for the recent pullback and explain why I am convinced Stamps.com provides an excellent combination of growth and value for your portfolio.STMP data by YChartsOn November 2nd, STMP opened at $226.45 and reported what appeared to be blowout earnings after the bell. The company reported earnings of $2.68 per share, trouncing estimates of $1.95 per share. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $2.49 per share. Total revenue and EBITDA were both up 24% YOY (year over year).Despite the strong beat on both revenue and earnings, the bears came out of hibernation after the close. Interestingly, the stock started dropping even before earnings results were released. By the time the market closed on November 3rd, STMP was trading at $171.10 per share, representing a 24% drop in just two days. Before we get into potential catalysts for the stock going forward, let's examine the main arguments given for the sell-off and decide how much they should affect our investing thesis going forward.1. Competitive threatsThe company's main competitors include UPS (NYSE: UPS), FedEx (NYSE: FDX), Pitney Bowes (NYSE: PBI), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY). Clearly, Amazon and Pitney Bowes are the two competitors that have investors most concerned. Pitney Bowes unveiled a low-cost offering in June with the intent of taking market share and Amazon recently announced a new offering called Seller Flex.Now, competition matters and the management team at Stamps.com takes it seriously. At the same time, I'm not ready to overreact to recent moves by either competitor. Pitney Bowes' latest move was to acquire a warehouse company with 1.2 million square feet of warehouse space. That is not even a part of Stamps.com's business. As far as Amazon is concerned, anytime Amazon is mentioned as a competitor, investor fears go into overdrive. An interesting thing about Stamps.com's business is that their main competitors in some aspects of their business are partners in other aspects. Stamp.com CEO Ken McBride stated that he actually sees Seller Flex as an enhancement to his company's solutions.2. Slowing growthA case could be made that revenue growth is slowing. In Q2, Stamps.com revenues showed a 38% uptick over the same period on 2016. In Q3, sales growth slowed to 24%. While there is no denying 24 is less than 38, there is also no denying the fact that 24% growth is a pretty robust number. According to Yahoo Finance, the five analysts following the stock expect earnings to grow by 15% over the next five years. That is a number most companies would love to have.3. Insider salesIn early November, Barron's penned an article highlighting an unusually high volume of insider sales. The author implied these were deceptive trades and referred to them as ""back of the envelope"" calculations. Certainly, that was worth checking into.The first thing I learned while researching the matter was there was nothing sneaky involved. In fact, it took me about 30 seconds to find all the insider trading activity on the company's website. A closer look at SEC documents revealed the fact that several executives did indeed sell stock but they simultaneously exercised options for an equal number of shares. Since most options were exercised for well under $100, the simultaneous move of exercising options and selling stock made sense to me. By liquidating a significant amount of money they can use in their daily lives and turning options into and an equal number of shares, the executives were able to have their cake and eat it too.The insinuation with any article highlighting insider sales is that executives think their company's stock is fully valued, or even overpriced. That simply is not true. Google's founding executives exercised plenty of options as the company matured. Howard Schultz sold plenty of Starbucks stock, even as the company was growing. While there is no way of knowing for sure, it seems that in the case of Stamps.com, the company does not believe its stock is overvalued. My main evidence for this statement is the fact that the company repurchased $103 million worth of stock and paid out $33 million in stock compensation. Those are hardly the actions of a management team who believes its stock price will decline.4. Tax creditAs noted earlier, the company reported Q3 results that, on the surface, blew away expectations. The company's revenue was up 24% YOY and earnings per share were up 73%. Naysayers will point to the $11 million tax credit which inflated earnings numbers and to a point they are correct. Both the tax credit and changing tax rates inflated EPS numbers and made YOY comparisons a little cloudier. However, investors who want to avoid the confusion that comes with these tax items do have other numbers to look at. Specifically, investors can see that revenues rose by 24%, gross margin was up about 1%, EBITDA rose by 24%, and income before taxes rose by 13%. All of these numbers negate the effect of the tax credit and represent solid financial performance.5. High short interestThis is a non-issue. Short interest does not necessarily have anything to do with the underlying fundamentals of a company.6. A personal concernStamps.com does pay out a very high percentage of its net income in stock-based compensation. In theory, I like stock-based compensation because it ensures that the company's interests are aligned with those of its shareholders. However, with Stamps.com, the amount of stock-based compensation is a little higher than I would like. The table below shows the amount of stock-based compensation paid over the last three quarters by Stamps.com and one of its largest competitors.SOURCE: SEC FILINGS FOR STAMPS.COM AND PITNEY BOWESThe growth story continuesIn September, Forbes Magazine named Stamps.com to its list of 25 Fastest Growing Public Tech Companies. The chart below shows that the company has rewarded shareholders to the tune of 276% in the past three years and justified that uptick with a corresponding jump in both revenues and net income. In addition to the metrics shown in the chart, paying customers and average revenue per user are both coming in at an all-time high. The five analysts that follow the company continue to expect significant growth going forward with a five-year annual growth projection of 15%.STMP data by YChartsThe value propositionOne would think that with a stock price rising almost 300% in three years, the stock's valuation would become a little rich and ripe for a pullback. In actuality, the chart above shows that earnings growth has slightly outpaced the stock price. The valuation has stayed in check.Further, I'd like to point out that most major financial websites overstate the company's PE ratio. Yahoo Finance shows STMP as having a PE of 28.12 and FactSet shows a PE of 22.91. If you take the midpoint of those two numbers, you get a PE of 25, right in line with that of the S&P 500. If you do your own math, however, you will find that STMP has an even lower valuation than reported by these sites.As we look at the last four quarter sequentially, we see EPS numbers of $2.73, $1.83, $2.08 and $2.68. Adding them up gives us a trailing 12 months EPS of $9.32. Using Monday's opening stock price of $175, that gives us a trailing 12 month PE of 17.78. That is a surprisingly low valuation for a company expected to grow earnings at 15% annually for the next five years.As investors, especially long-term investors, we are much more interested in where a stock is going than where it is right now. With that in mind, I will make a conservative projection based on analysts' predicted growth rates. Since Stamps.com has handily beaten estimates in each of the last five quarters, I would expect them to at least meet expectations in the next four quarters so I will apply the consensus 15% growth rate to the first year. After that, I will model for 14% growth in years two and three and 12% growth in years four and five. Then, I will apply a PE of 21 for the year 2022 and we will see where we land. The yearly calculations are below:DATA SOURCE: STAMPS.COM AND YAHOO FINANCEStamps.com seems to be in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. Stamps.com is a rapidly growing company and a fast-growing industry that is showing no signs of slowing down. While I could nitpick and find a couple flaws, like their overgenerous stock-based compensation formula, all in all, things look promising going forward. As the only pureplay in software postage and shipping solutions, I believe Stamps.com will continue to reap the benefits of the growth in e-commerce and as an investor, the potential rewards far outweigh any risks."
4078727,70965,2017-06-05T10:19:25-04:00,Controversy has followed STMP for the last couple of quarters.The company's use (and alleged abuse) of the USPS postage re-seller program has been continually called into question.We lay out why we believe STMP is not a good place to allocate capital.,"By Parke ShallWe have watched the controversy over Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) ensue over the last couple of quarters. In today's article, we wanted to lay out what we believe are the pros and the cons to the story and talk about why we have had, and will continue to have, a small short position on in the name.Over the last couple of quarters the question has been whether or not Stamps.com has been abusing a postage reseller program that the United States Postal Service has implemented. The original point of the reseller program was to pull together small to midsized companies who do shipping and packing but aren't on the grand ""mass shipping"" scale that companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). In other words, it was an idea put together to funnel more business to the post office. There is no doubt that the post office could use the extra business.Stamps has been alleged to have abused the program by pulling together parties who would not on their own be capable of using the reseller program, giving them postage at a discount, and pocketing a small arbitrage between those parties and what the United States Postal Service ultimately charges. The $10 million question over the last year or so is whether or not this constitutes an egregious abuse of the system and whether or not the post office will eventually step in to sever off what is a gushing cash flow fountain for STMP.There's actually a really good case for those who are bullish. The case basically relies around the fact that the United States Postal Service is desperate for business. The post office, financially has been a wreck for years and they need all the help they can get in terms of generating revenue. And while it is usually not our stance on companies that are scheming the government or other companies, there actually is a case for the post office doing nothing and simply allowing STMP to continue business as usual.But when we think about where we want to invest our capital and where other investors may want to invest their capital, piling into a company that is near 52 week highs whose business model is to some degree, we believe, reliant on a disingenuous scheme, may not be a great idea.STMP data by YChartsThe risk reward of going in and purchasing STMP stock here in hopes that they will simply be able to continue gaming the system and that you might be able to get 30% or 40% upside as analysts have predicted is skewed heavily towards the risk. While your reward in that type of scenario would likely be 30% or 40%, the potential risk at all times remains much larger, possibly up to and above 50% if this program were to cease operations.When you think about a quality stock that you want to invest in over the course of the long term, you think not only about sustainable cash flows for years to come but also about limited risk. For example, if we were to go out and invest in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) tomorrow, we know the company has a history of paying and raising dividends and we know that even if Coca-Cola got shut down in the United States tomorrow, the stock may only lose 10% or 15% of its value as it is it is a highly diversified company worldwide with many legs to stand on.The risk profile in a company like STMP is significantly different. This is a place where if you let capital rest for a long-term investment you may be susceptible to large moves downward. As you can see from the chart above, the stock is a ""react first, find out what's going on later"" stock. You can see various dips where people have written critically about the company, or where news has come out and pushed it lower for a day or two. While it has rebounded so far and continues to make its way upward, do you really want an investment that is going to require 110% of your time, at all times, to stay on top of the news flow in any developments in the United States postal service postage reseller world?If you haven't read the comprehensive short thesis on STMP, there are several fantastic critical articles on Seeking Alpha and a great report by Prescience Point that lays out the thesis in full. When it boils down to it, the company's entire business model is a questionable endeavour that's presented to the public using non-GAAP numbers. We think this is double trouble and we believe that a short position in STMP for the long run may turn out to be very lucrative.If you can stomach the limited reward for larger risk, maybe STMP is a stock for you. For us, we just simply don't see it as a company that makes sense. Insiders have been selling and a large portion of the company's core business is in a grey area that we think is susceptible to legitimate regulatory risk. Again, when we invest our capital to the long side we like steady uninterrupted cash flow streams and a limited risk profile. STMP is just the opposite and may actually present a compelling short case depending on timing surrounding any type of regulatory catalyst. We have been short before, we will be short again and we continue to keep a close eye on STMP developments."
4076829,103145,2017-05-26T11:59:31-04:00,"Stamps.com has been diversifying its product offerings over the years.
        The financial situation of the company is sound and the business model will provide strong results going forward.
        The growth of e-commerce will greatly benefit the company.
        Despite competition, Stamps.com continues to grow at a rapid pace.","Investment Thesis:I believe that Stamps.com will continue to experience growth due to a rapidly growing e-commerce economy and significant room for expansion. The company has been embarking on a journey of diversification and is now well positioned to benefit from macroeconomic trends. I will first give you an overview of the company and its various services in order to highlight how the company's offerings are now more suitable for the future than they have been in the past. Furthermore, I will discuss the company's attractive financials before touching on the competition and some potential risks.Company Overview:Founded in 1996, Stamps.com provides its customers with online postage solutions. The company is chiefly partnered with the United States Postal Service and was the first company to ever become a USPS approved PC Postage vendor. Through their online services, the company allows customers, from individuals to large enterprises, to print postage using standard printers and an Internet connection.Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) operates in a single reportable segment, ""Internet Mailing and Shipping Solutions"". This segment encompasses the entirety of the company's core postage solutions business and can be broken down into the following five brands:Services:Looking more in depth at the company's services, it is clear that Stamps.com has been attempting to diversify its offerings to support customer demands for other shipping carriers in addition to USPS. Let's take a look at what the targeted customer segments of each brand are and what they add to the overall business.Stamps.com is the original service that brought about online postage solutions. Customers pay a monthly subscription service fee and the cost of postage, albeit at a discounted rate when comparing prices directly to USPS. Almost all of the types of envelopes, packages, etc. that USPS offers are supported through the site. Stamps.com also has a variety of features that make it attractive to higher volume shippers and businesses. One of the most important is the ability of the service to automate many aspects of the shipping process including automatic addressing, pre-filled forms, and batch printing.Endicia was acquired by Stamps.com on November 18, 2015 and is one of the few other companies that is also a USPS approved PC Postage company. Stamps.com purchased Endicia in order to expand its offerings for high volume and large enterprise customers. Endicia is the leading provider of high volume USPS shipping solutions due to its database integration, automation support, and high volume shipping software product integration capabilities.ShipStation, which was acquired on June 10, 2014, marked Stamps.com's first foray into supporting other carriers. Over 35 different carriers are supported, including UPS (NYSE:UPS), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and DHL (private), making the service attractive to customers who avoided Stamps.com limitedness to only USPS. ShipStation is primarily an e-commerce shipping solution and has over 100 partner integrations that allow sellers on sites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) to directly utilize the service without leaving their platforms.Like ShipStation, ShipWorks, acquired on August 29, 2014, also supports a variety of shipping carriers and has partner integrations. The primary differentiator for this service lies in its support for more complex shipping solutions. As client-based software, solutions to issues such as international customs forms, return shipping labels, etc. are able to easily be handled.Lastly, ShippingEasy is another service focused on e-commerce merchants with support for multiple carriers and partner integrations. ShippingEasy also offers product management support for its customers. This makes the service especially valuable to small businesses that are just starting up.Financials:The company's business model results in strong cash flows due to the recurring revenue streams from its subscriptions. Service revenues, defined by the company as revenues derived from subscriptions plans, USPS compensation for waived service fees, and transaction related revenues, comprised 86% of the company's total revenues in 2016. As can be seen in the graph below, total revenues have been seeing strong growth thanks in large part to the company's multiple acquisitions over the years.Furthermore, the number of annual paid customers continues to grow as the churn rate continues to decrease. In 2016, the number of annual paid customers rose to 656,000, representing a 13% year-over-year increase. At the same time, the annual average paid customer churn rate fell to a low of only 3.0%.Stamps.com operates an extremely high margin business due to the digital nature of the services it provides and the lack of significant costs of revenues. Since customers print their own labels and postage, costs associated with printing and ink replacements do not impact the company. In 2016, total gross margin stood at 82.7% according to GAAP standards.With a short interest ratio hovering around 37%, Stamps.com is one of the most highly shorted stocks on the market. Conditions like this create the perfect opportunity for a short squeeze. Amid a newly authorized $90 million share repurchase plan over the next six months, the stock has continued to climb higher recently. For reasons that I will discuss in just a bit, future catalysts could potentially trigger a short squeeze and further add to the buying pressure the company has been facing.Growth Opportunity:As I discussed in my article ""How To Play The Future Of Retail"", online business and e-commerce is expected to continue growing at a rapid pace going into the future. In 2017, online and non-store sales are expected to triple the growth rate of brick and mortar stores. By 2020, worldwide e-commerce sales are projected to top $4 trillion.The growth of e-commerce will play a critical role in the company's earnings going forward. As more and more shopping is performed online instead of in person, the number of packages that need to be shipped will rise accordingly. While it may be difficult to choose which specific shipping companies will benefit the most from this trend, Stamps.com will benefit regardless. Through the company's diversification efforts, they are no longer dependent on the success of just USPS, but rather shipping carriers as a whole.Stamps.com also has significant room for expansion within the current market. Annual postage printed in dollar terms reached $5.5 billion in 2016 yet represents only 2% of the top four carriers' revenue, as shown in the chart below.According to the Small Business Administration, there are currently 28 million small businesses in the United States. With only 722,000 customers as of Q1'17, the potential customer growth is enormous.Competition:Stamps.com faces competition from a variety of sources. Despite postage for USPS being the core business, USPS also represents one of the company's largest competitors. Customers and businesses that go directly to the post office can pay for postage there, essentially cutting Stamps.com out of the equation. This issue also occurs with other shipping companies that have retail locations, such as UPS, FedEx, and DHL. However, customers who do so stand to pay a higher price than they would on Stamps.com.The most direct competitor that Stamps.com faces is Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI), another USPS approved PC postage vendor. In addition to offering a similar service of online postage solutions, Pitney Bowes also sells traditional postage meters. While postage meters can provide an individual or business with a faster processing time, they do not offer the same degree of automation and integration that Stamps.com does.Risks:Conclusion:Due to the company's efforts to diversify its service offerings, Stamps.com is well positioned to experience explosive growth as e-commerce continues to grow. The company has moved away from its reliance on USPS and is now able to benefit from the success of the shipping industry as a whole. Additionally, the relatively small market penetration the company currently has allows for significant expansion. The financial situation is sound and an increasing share price may be beginning to put the massive amount of short sellers on edge. Despite competitive threats, Stamps.com's ability to create value for its customers by saving them time and money will continue to be a primary driving force for years to come."

Additionally, if you own one of the three (3) EBITDA losers in the Index [Wayfair (NYSE:W), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK)] my advice is sell at the bid, and roll what will likely remain losing bets into Stamps.com.To be fair, there is a vocal bear contingent focused on Stamps.com, which emerged appropriately six months ago. If you haven't already, I would encourage you to read their case (see SA Pro Research, Stamps.com: When numbers look to good to be true, they usually are and Stamps.com: The Software Valeant?).Top 3 Reasons For My BullishnessHaving broken its 50-day moving average of $101.20, I want to share the top three (3) reasons why I've assigned a $180 price target to a stock, which can currently be purchased for about $105 per share (approximately 15.5x EV/EBITDA). First, for those unfamiliar with the business, here is more about the company.About Stamps.comThe Stamps.com business model is pretty straightforward as illustrated by this picture on the company's homepage and summary description on its IR homepage:Investor Relations homepage, ""Stamps.com provides easy, convenient and cost-effective Internet-based services for mailing or shipping letters, packages or parcels. Its PC Postage service is designed to allow individuals, home offices, small businesses or corporations to print US postage using any PC, any ordinary inkjet or laser printer, and an Internet connection. And Its PhotoStamps™ product allows consumers and businesses to turn digital photos, designs or corporate logos into valid US postage.""1. New Opportunities for Revenue GrowthUnlike Bain's Blue Nile with quarterly year-over-year revenue growth of -4.4%, or the Index median of 18.1%, Stamps.com has recently had quarterly revenue growth (year-over-year) of 79.1%*. As a matter of fact, Stamps.com's quarterly revenue growth rate is greater than every other stock in the Index, including heavy weights Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) at 29.0% and 54.7%, respectively.*It should be noted that Stamps.com organic revenue growth in the period was approximately 26%, with the remaining growth attributable to the Endicia & ShippingEasy acquisitions (see: page 28, Stamps.com Company Presentation, November 2016).A key reason I'm bullish on new revenue growth prospects is that I'm hearing from members of my professional network that Stamps.com is capitalizing on new opportunities. For example, e-commerce leader Kellyco (world's largest metal detector company) recently asked its third-party logistics (3PL) provider, Red Stag Fulfillment, to add USPS Priority Mail service as a lower-cost express shipping offering to its platform. Red Stag's President, Eric McCollom, told me ""We listened to our clients and realize the value a USPS shipping option provides for their lighter-weight accessories and products. Especially given the 1-to-3 day service levels Priority Mail delivers. We looked at the options of integrating our warehouse and order management system directly with USPS or using an integrator such as Stamps.com. Stamps[.com] has proven a much easier and effective technical solution.""2. 'Amazon-proof' Nature of Stamps.com Business ModelInstead of directly competing with Amazon like a single product category competitor such as Blue Nile, Stamps.com can profit when Amazon Marketplace makes the sale. Here's why and when.According to Multichannel Merchant and ShipMatrix, of the Big 3 U.S. parcel carriers USPS delivers the most e-commerce packages. And ""If you're shipping parcels that weigh from 1-3 lbs., the USPS can be the most cost-effective way to get your customers' package to them...The value proposition for USPS vs. the major carriers starts falling off when parcel weights go above 3 lbs., shippers and experts say. But the great majority of ecommerce shipments are still in the lower weight range."" (see: The USPS Ups Its E-Commerce Parcel Game)3. Recurring Revenue From Existing Customer BaseStamps.com's Mailing & Shipping business has a recurring revenue based model. Service revenue is earned from different subscription and transaction based models. Supplies store and package insurance revenue are recurring with usage. Q3‐16 Monthly Paid Customer Churn was 3.0%, down 0.4% versus Q3‐15. (source: page 27 & 31, Stamps.com Company Presentation, November 2016)According to Stamps.com's Investor Metrics 2016 in each of the past three (3) quarters the Company has had in excess of 600,000 customers. ARPU (average revenue per user) is said to have grown from $40.65 in Q1 to $45.05 in Q3, while adjusted EBTIDA margin also grew from 42.5% in Q1 to 49.2% in Q3.The Bottom LineWhile there is risk to the downside as pointed out by a couple vocal bears, in my opinion it's quite possible that Stamps.com will see $180 per share this coming year due to its 1) New opportunities for revenue growth, 2) 'Amazon Proof' nature of business model & 3) Recurring revenue from existing customer base.The Guideline Public Company Method and ""Moving the e-Markets Valuation IndexThe Guideline Public Company method involves a comparison of the subject company to publicly traded companies. The comparison is generally based on published data regarding the public companies' stock price and earnings, sales, or revenues, which is expressed as a fraction known as a ""multiple"". A widely used source for the Guideline Public Company method in the e-commerce sector, is the 'Moving the e-Markets Valuation Index'.The 15 publicly traded companies that make up the Index are: Alibaba, Amazon, Blue Nile*, Cimpress/Vistprint (NASDAQ:CMPR), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Groupon, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Nutrisystem (NASDAQ:NTRI), Overstock.com, PetMed Express (NASDAQ:PETS), Shutterfly (NASDAQ:SFLY), Stamps.com, U.S. Auto Parts (PARTS), Wayfair, and 1-800-FLOWERS (NASDAQ:FLWS). *Blue Nile will be removed the Index as soon as Bain Capital Private Equity and Bow Street complete their take-private acquisition of the company."
4011992,86936,2016-10-13T16:10:51-04:00,"STMP occupies a dominant position in a protected market space because it owns one of three PC Postage licenses in the country.STMP’s two PC Postage competitors, Pitney Bowes and Shippo, pose no immediate threat.STMP’s vertical consolidation of the shipping industry has enhanced its market power throughout the value chain, driving future revenues growth.Assuming 20% revenue CAGR in the next two years with 40% adjusted EBITDA margin and 11x EV/EBITDA multiple, the projected stock price is $115, representing 20% upside.Buy STMP.","Recommendation: Overweight. Target Price: $115 (Stock price: $95.60 as of 10/6/2016; upside: 20%)SummaryStamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) occupies a dominant position in a protected market space because it owns one of three PC Postage licenses in the country, its customer base, and its marketplace integrations. STMP's two PC Postage competitors, Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI) and Shippo, pose no immediate threat because they (1) cannot grow their digital solutions segment without cannibalizing existing business and (2) lack the scale to build STMP's business development level or range of offerings. This leaves Stamps.com well-positioned to take advantage of a boom in ecommerce (projected growth rate over the next two years is 34% by some estimates). Revenues are up by 47% since 2013 and are forecast to keep climbing, driven (importantly for STMP) by increases in customer bases and number of orders. Additionally, STMP's vertical consolidation of the shipping industry has enhanced its market power throughout the value chain, driving future revenues growth. Finally, while shorts have pushed down the price with claims that the USPS would cancel part of STMP's postage license, all the evidence suggests that the Postal Service approves of STMP's behavior. Stamps.com helps the USPS cut costs and compete in market segments it would otherwise be unable to because of price regulation as a government operation.IntroductionStamps.com provides online mailing and shipping solutions. The company offers (1) discounted USPS mailing and shipping services which enable customers to print US postage and offer additional digital services such as address verification, automation, and data management. They are marketed to a wide range of customer segments, from small/home offices to high-volume shipping warehouses. The firm offers (2) multi-carrier shipping solutions which include software services for medium to high-volume shippers such as warehouses who require more than USPS offerings. The company also offers (3) mailing and shipping integrations which provides postage to online marketplaces. This is a back-end integration which enables administrators of the marketplaces to manage order and shipping data for front-end buyers and sellers. Finally, Stamps.com also comprises legacy (4) mailing and shipping supply stores, (5) branded insurance, and (6) customized postage segments which constitute a significantly smaller portion of its business. In 2015, 83% of STMP revenues came from USPS offerings, multi-carrier solutions, and shipping integrations, 9% came from mailing and shipping supplies, 5% came from insurance, and 3% came from customized postage.RisksI. Key customer risk: STMP is dependent on the USPS, and USPS reserves the right to cut off STMP'S license within 30 days, as well as enter the business themselves. This, however, is unlikely for reasons given below. USPS could also try to pull more profit out of Stamps, by squeezing back the spread STMP takes on the discounted postage or by changing the reseller relationships.II. Commoditized product: STMP is vulnerable to competition because its end product is postage, which is hard to differentiate.III. Stamps is not compatible with any Apple products or Android.IV. Drone delivery could enable shippers to avoid the USPS (this technology is admittedly still a ways off), while cyber attacks on STMP databases could hurt its credibility.Why STMP is a buyI. STMP is one of only three sellers approved to sell postage online in the country, making it a dominant player in a market with high barriers to entry. Its size, market share, and investments in technology infrastructure make it the only player with credibility among high volume shippers. Additionally, STMP's huge market share in PC Postage will enable it to charge resellers more, supporting steady margins growth.Stamps gains a considerable competitive advantage simply from the fact that it holds a PC Postage license. A PC Postage license gives its holder the ability to sell postage that can be printed electronically. It also means that the retailer can offer discounts exclusively available to online postage buyers (including bulk discounts). In the seventeen years that the program has existed, only five companies - Stamps.com/Endicia, Pitney Bowes, Shippo, and Amazon and Etsy (who have the right to sell online postage exclusively for their customers) - have been granted licenses. This is a protected market space.Furthermore, STMP has made significant investments in business development which cannot easily be replicated. As a result, STMP and its subsidiaries have over 300 unique partnerships with marketplaces, shopping carts and eCommerce tools. Thanks to recent acquisitions, Stamps also offers solutions for over 20 different carriers. It also has offerings in multi-shipper solutions along with application programming interfaces (APIs) for use by back-end application developers. STMP's volumes, in the hundreds of millions of packages, outstrip its nearest rivals in the digital segment by 100x. The firm has credibility among high-volume and e-commerce shippers that is likely to reinforce itself as it continues to grow this segment.Finally, STMP's recent acquisitions spree has enabled the firm to increase its market power throughout the value chain of the shipping industry. This gives STMP the ability to charge its resellers, along with others who need PC Postage, more for it. In one example, STMP bought ShipStation, which sells shipping management software to small businesses, in June 2014. After it was bought by STMP, ShipStation started to charge the reseller it used, ExpressOne, seven cents more per transaction. Stamps/ShipStation had more negotiating power because there was only one firm selling PC postage that ExpressOne could buy from. Additionally, ShipStation had access to the much larger Stamps.com customer base, which it could send towards ExpressOne. This strategy drove STMP's 38% revenue per user (ARPU) growth in 2015 and can be expected to continue to boost EBITDA.II. STMP's competitors are unlikely to pose a threat in the medium term.As mentioned above, PC Postage licenses make Stamps' market segments relatively protected. Only two other noteworthy companies have one.PitneyBowes is unlikely to advance very far in the digital arena. Even though it has a PC Postage license, a majority of PBI's revenues come from its legacy business, selling analog postage meters (PBI has 900,000 US meters). Only 21% of its business is in digital commerce. Postage meters and PC Postage compete against each other, so Pitney probably cannot expand its PC Postage business without cannibalizing the meter segment that brings in most of its revenue. As evidence of this, the digital SendPro solution that Pitney has rolled out is oriented towards low-volume offices, while its meter business is primarily used by high-volume offices. Moreover, the offering has been slow to gain traction: software segment revenues fell by 4% the quarter after SendPro's debut, and it has 1 API integration against STMP's 300 partnerships. Furthermore, Pitney has yet to break into the medium to high-volume shipping market, while STMP's acquisitions have substantially beefed up its offerings there.Shippo is a startup that deserves long-term consideration but is presently too small to pose a significant threat to Stamps. Like STMP, Shippo has a PC Postage license, enabling it to offer competitive discounts on USPS postage. The company sells an Application Programming Interface, or API, as basically its only product (obviously unlike Stamps.com). Its API is more sophisticated that STMPs, and APIs will likely play an important role in the industry's future. In the medium term, however, robust demand for STMP's software as a service offerings will continue to exist. And at present, Shippo is too small to spend what it would need to on business development to compete with STMP on marketplace integrations and high-volume shippers. It recently received $7 million in A-series VC funding and in value of packages shipped STMP is well over 100x what Shippo does.III. STMP is well-positioned to take advantage of a surge in e-commerce given favorable macro trends in ecommerce and its dominance among USPS parcelsSTMP will benefit from robust macro growth projected in the ecommerce sector. Since 2013, non-travel ecommerce sales have climbed 47% in a trend that seems likely to continue, according to Bloomberg. Even better for Stamps.com, those numbers are driven mostly by an increase in the number of transactions (up 23%) and number of buyers (up 18%). There are more packages to ship. This trend is also reflected in rising mailing and shipping revenues amongst the top four shippers by volume: at UPS, DHL, FedEx, and the USPS, these have climbed an average of 6% from 2015 to 2016. Topline revenue growth obviously boosts STMP's revenues directly. Perhaps more importantly, these carriers' increasing focus on ecommerce will help STMP increase its percentage share of these shippers' shipping revenues. Right now, STMP currently accounts for only 4% of those top four carriers' revenue, so there is a great deal of room to grow.STMP will benefit in particular from the USPS's decision to increase its focus on ecommerce. Most of Stamps.com's revenues still come from its USPS business, and it's most competitive there. The PC Postage license enables it to offer discounts on postage, sign negotiated service agreements (NSAs) with resellers, and offer a USPS API. When USPS ecommerce does well, Stamps does even better. Right now, the trends are positive: it has 56.6% of total parcel delivery volume and its revenue growth in parcels in Q3-2016 y/y was 18%. USPS is focusing more on ecommerce: it has committed to doubling its packaging capacity and has put out a contract for larger trucks to handle more packages. Because USPS trucks have to stop at every house in the country daily to deliver mail, they have a capacity to take an ecommerce order the last mile to a customer's home which is unmatched by private-sector competitors.IV. STMP's past and future acquisitions will also drive EBITDA growth through synergies, organic growth among high-volume shippers, and customer base growth.Stamps made a major acquisition of Endicia in November 2015. It is still realizing revenue synergies from the deal. Endicia will also drive organic growth at the high-volume end of the market, where STMP had not previously competed.Future acquisitions should also drive revenue growth. Future acquisitions, like previous ones, will likely be aimed at adding to STMP's customer base. STMP has thus far been successful at maintaining/increasing ARPU as it has brought on new customers through acquisitions so an overall increase in revenue is likely. Additionally, consolidation and a larger customer base should give STMP more vertical market power (see above) which should also help revenues.V. Concerns about cancellation of Stamps' reseller NSAs have pushed prices down but evidence is that the USPS approves of how STMP uses the reseller program so those claims look unfounded.Stamps has close relationships with seven firms who aggregate customers and resell them USPS postage at lower rates through individually-negotiated service agreements (NSAs). Recent short reports charged that Stamps' use of reseller agreements was illegitimate and that one or more agreements might be cancelled.Industry experts have largely debunked this claim. To boost its own margins, the USPS needs to grow volumes in priority mail and first-class packages, where it competes against private-sector carriers. However, while private competitors negotiate discounted rates with merchants to gain market share, each change to USPS pricing must be individually approved by regulators. USPS's way around this problem is to offer discounts to PC Postage vendors like Stamps, which then has the flexibility to negotiate discounts. Additionally, USPS knows Stamps.com offers lower labor costs and better customer service than it can. Far from violating the rules, the reseller agreements are working as the USPS needs them to. Second, STMP's management has attested that no single reseller accounts for 10% of their Also, if one agreement was cancelled, it would likely migrate to another reseller with a relationship with STMP, so net impact to revenue would be minimal.Shorts also claimed that Stamps was pocketing all of the spread between the discounted postage they bought and what they sold it for, which also endangered the reseller agreement. This, they claimed, explained why USPS growth in those sectors was lackluster: 1.3% while industry-wide it was 4%.STMP management linked the fall-off in the relevant mail classes to the USPS' one-time adjustment of weight ranges in January. Volume had migrated to other classes. Also, volumes for parcel services and first-class mail, the other two categories in which Stamps competes, were up on the quarter, while volumes for all three were up on the year. Revenues for all three were also up. STMP also made the point that reseller comprises such a small part of overall postal volumes that it cannot account by itself for quarterly shifts in volumes and revenue.ValuationAssuming a 20% CAGR for revenue in the next two years with a 40% adjusted EBITDA margin and a 11x EV/EBITDA multiple, the projected stock price is $115, representing 20% upside from today's price.Below is a quick comparison sheet for STMP."
4074232,83086,2017-05-18T10:00:00-04:00,"Last year, we exposed Stamps.com’s failure to disclose settlements with government agencies; we believe management is yet again involved in a regulatory cover-up, with the stakes far higher this time.Management has behaved in a bizarre manner for the past several months, including dumping stock, absence from public forums, and allegedly privately discussing reseller arrangements/economics without making broader public disclosures.Industry sources have claimed that the USPS is exploring changes to the way Stamps.com monetizes postage; management has never expressly denied this claim, instead playing games with words.65%+ of EBITDA is at risk; when/if the USPS takes action, management will face a credibility crisis given recent insider selling and unwillingness to provide disclosures around reseller arrangements.Stamps.com needs to be more transparent and stop discussing information in private calls/meetings; we think the company is covering something up, and we think the truth could come out shortly.","About one year ago, we released our first report on Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) that revolved around the company's disclosure practices. We discovered that Stamps.com had failed to inform investors that it had settled a series of actions with government agencies relating to the company's questionable business practices. However, Stamps.com took its deception one step further. Not only did the company fail to inform investors about its government settlements, but it also abruptly stopped providing disclosure on churn levels right after the settlements became effective. The settlement included stipulations requiring Stamps.com to make it easier for customers to cancel, the exact type of situation that could have caused churn to spike materially. So Stamps.com not only covered up government settlements, but it then went and modified its disclosures in a way that would obscure the potential financial statement fallout of the settlements.While this information is now in the rearview mirror, we raise this anecdote to remind readers that Stamps.com has a history of covering up its interactions with government agencies and not keeping investors informed of material developments in its regulatory relations. Based on a mosaic of information we have dug up over the past few months, we believe that Stamps.com management is yet again in cover-up mode. The only difference between the cover-up this time versus what we found last year is that the stakes are far higher this time, with 65%+ of earnings at risk.While we stand by the general factual accuracy of our first report, we readily admit today that we missed the forest from the trees. Our thesis at the time was that churn in the core business would explode higher due to the government settlements. What we did NOT fully understand at the time is that the core Stamps.com business - i.e. the side impacted by undisclosed government settlements - had become a much smaller piece of overall earnings.The truth began to emerge in mid-2016. Without providing appropriate disclosures to the market over the past few years, Stamps.com's executives transformed Stamps.com's sources of earnings, transitioning the business away from a tired busted 90's dot com credit card auto-billing scheme and into a shipping arbitrage scheme that exploits a poorly designed government program.While refusing to provide any color on reseller arrangements to the market in public disclosures, we have confirmed with multiple sources - including Stamps.com shareholders - that company representatives have allegedly been more than willing to discuss reseller arrangements in some closed door private meetings, with Stamps.com management allegedly privately admitting that its earnings derived from the reseller loophole are materially significant to their business. We do not take the act of making this claim lightly. In fact, given the obvious Reg FD implications of such a claim, we had a research associate reach out to Stamps.com to confirm what our sources told us and to ask the company why it feels comfortable discussing reseller materiality behind closed doors but not in public. We did NOT receive a reply from Stamps.com.But we get it. We understand why Stamps.com's management has been so reluctant to PUBLICLY discuss the reseller loophole with the market. Stamps.com management found a way to exploit a loophole in a program. Kudos to them for being sharp capitalists. It makes perfect sense for Stamps.com to not want to proudly tell the world about its secret sauce. Stamps.com management likely anticipated the ugly PR implications of being outed for being involved in this type of scheme that we believe is very obviously taking advantage of a poorly designed government program.We won't shed much new light on the Stamps.com scheme today. We advise readers to review the Prescience Point report and to subscribe to Capitol Forum. We also note that Marc Cohodes has publicly tweeted numerous criticisms of Stamps.com. Despite the plethora of loud and vocal voices on the short side of the Stamps.com debate, we believe the entire mosaic of smoke has never been presented in one single place. Furthermore, as we analyze and reflect on the mosaic of red flags that currently engulf Stamps.com, we believe it is very apparent that SOMETHING is going on with the reseller program that Stamps.com management does not want investors to know about.For readers who have not studied the reseller program in detail, just be aware that it effectively relates to the ways in which Stamps.com ""monetizes"" the postage sold through its platform. Stamps.com ""bears"" believe that Stamps.com is improperly ""monetizing"" postage by skimming economics off three middle-men postage resellers - Intuiship, Express One, and Parcel Partners. Bears believe that Stamps.com is using these middle-men to earn a margin on postage sales that the USPS never intended Stamps.com to earn, thereby enhancing Stamps.com's revenues and earnings at the cost of the USPS. The bears believe that the USPS has been ""hoodwinked"" by Stamps.com's exploitation of a poorly designed and ill-conceived government program. But again, we encourage you to read the work by Capitol Forum and Prescience Point to better understand the criticisms of the reseller program.Given the upcoming National Postal Forum, an industry conference attended by both industry and government players, we are writing this report not only for shareholders, but for government employees who we have reason to believe (based on recent news reports) are currently evaluating the future of the USPS reseller loophole that Stamps.com so cleverly exploited.We also present this report as a criticism of the way Stamps.com is currently handling its PR problems and disclosure obligations. In our view, Stamps.com is going out of its way to ""control the narrative"" around its stock, but is doing so in a highly suspect manner. Rather than publicly addressing criticisms of its business practices, we believe that the company has resorted to invite-only broker hosted calls, ""1x1"" investor meetings, and ""non-deal"" roadshows (i.e. through Goldman, etc.) in order to instill confidence amongst shareholders.Source: Our review of press releasesWhile we think it's a cheap move to draw a ""Valeant"" analogy, we do note that similar tactics were employed by Mike Pearson in March 2016 at a time when he too was attempting to ""control the narrative"" on a sinking ship.While management confidence games can often provide short-term support for stock prices as they help to calm jittery shareholder nerves, our experience is that these types of games eventually unravel, with shareholders discovering the hard way that a management team willing to play fast and loose with Reg FD is the same type of management team that leads shareholders to the slaughterhouse.The Cover-Up Mosaic: What Is Really Going On With Stamps.com?1. Huge Insider Sales:The obvious red flag that got everyone looking at Stamps.com with a skeptical eye was the staggering stock dump from insiders in March onwards. We viewed the insider selling as even more suspect after reviewing a redline version of Stamps.com's 10-K that was filed in February 2017. In that filing, we noted that for the first time, the company revised its risk factor disclosures to allude to risks associated with ""indirect payments"" tied to ""integration partners."" Consistent with Stamps.com's strategy of obfuscating disclosures, the company's risk factor modification made little to no sense in plain English. However, we viewed the risk factor change as opening the door for future stock sales and as providing defense for the company in the event of future shareholder litigation.Disclosure Language Change in 2016 v 2015 10-K:Source: Bloomberg redline analysis of 2016 vs. 2015 10-KThe subtle disclosure modification, in conjunction with the staggering stock sales, paint a picture of a management team that was already paving the way in February to open the door for stock sales while reducing legal liability risk. In the first half of 2017, both the CEO and CFO dumped staggering amounts of stock in short order, going as far as exercising options expiring in 2024 and 2025 early in order to bail on stock. This selling came despite the fact that the company subsequently made the unusual decision to provide ""long-term"" guidance in its fiscal year end call - something that Stamps.com had not done for the past several years.While the CEO attempted to play down his stock sale due to an ongoing personal matter, we note that only a small fraction of his stock sale was attributed to the said personal matter. Furthermore, the CFO sold essentially his entire actionable stake in the stock. Why would Stamps.com's CFO want to dump almost his entire actionable stake in STMP shares when the management team had just given full-year guidance that called for a material acceleration in revenues starting in 2018? We also encourage readers to look into Mr. Huebner's selling history - he has been one of the most astute traders of Stamps.com shares on both the buy and sell side of the equation. Furthermore, if you do the math, the company essentially pitched itself as an earnings double. Did Mr. Huebner not actually believe the HIGHLY UNUSUAL long-term guidance? We acknowledge that Mr. Huebner recently received new option grants following his sale. And if Mr. Huebner's sale was taken in isolation, we would be more willing to excuse the behavior…however, the insider selling is just one of the many red flags surrounding the CFO's recent behavior.CEO Stock Sale Analysis - 25%+ of actionable stake dumped in short order, with the CEO's ""personal matter"" only representing <10% of the proceeds of the sale:Source: STMP Proxy, Friendly Bear analysis, McBride Form 4 filed on March 10, 2017CFO Stock Sale Analysis - ~90% of actionable stake dumped in short order:Source: STMP Proxy, Friendly Bear analysis, Huebner Form 4 from March 16.2. CFO mysteriously absent & avoiding public questions - why?We spoke with numerous sources who were at an investor conference in March 2017 (Roth Capital Partners) and indicated that Mr. Huebner was slated to appear at the conference and hold meetings with investors on the afternoon of March 14, 2017. Mr. Huebner, however, cancelled his attendance last minute. Our sources indicate that the CEO of Stamps.com had to make the drive from El Segundo to the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point to take Mr. Huebner's place on short notice. According to numerous sources we spoke with, Stamps.com's IR representative indicated that Mr. Huebner's was unable to attend the conference because he ""had the flu.""On that same day (March 14th, 2017), Mr. Huebner, allegedly sick with the flu, appears to have been healthy enough to call his broker to begin executing a massive stock dump. According to his Form 4 filing, on the day Mr. Huebner was apparently too sick to meet with investors at the Roth Capital Partners conference, he was early-exercising his 2024/2025 and selling his Stamps.com shareholdings. You can see the timing of his sales on the Form 4…t he sales began on March 14th and continued for several days.Source: Image; Friendly Bear graphicsBut investors familiar with Stamps.com will no doubt be aware that this not the first time Mr. Huebner had the flu in 2017.On the most recent earnings call on May 3rd, 2017, Stamps.com's investor relations representative opened the call indicating that Mr. Huebner was not present because he ""had the flu."" We want to tread carefully here. Two bouts of the flu in a 6 week time span could very well represent a more significant health problem for Mr. Huebner, and out of respect to him, we want to acknowledge that there could be something more at play here. We hope that is not the case and wish him the best.However, we wonder why Stamps.com would not be more transparent with investors at this point about what is really going on with Mr. Huebner. Because if all he really had was the flu, we find it hard to believe that he could not gather enough energy to dial-in to his own earnings call from home. So did Mr. Huebner really have two back-to-back bouts with the flu in a six week timespan?We also note that Mr. Huebner was healthy enough to be featured on an invite-only call for Craig Hallum clients on May 9 th, only days after the Stamps.com earnings call. We therefore gather that he is not so ill that he is unable to take and make phone calls. Furthermore, for a company facing serious PR problems, we do wonder who at Stamps.com thought it would be a bright idea to have Mr. Huebner re-emerge only to host a call with Craig Hallum. We spoke to sources who listened to the Craig Hallum call who indicated that Mr. Huebner did NOT allow any Q&A during the call, instead going through a script of questions from the Craig Hallum analyst.Given our skeptical view of Craig Hallum, we take little comfort in Huebner's decision to use Craig Hallum of all firms as a way of getting investors comfortable with his mysterious recent behavior.Mr. Huebner's absence from Stamps.com's most recent earnings call was just one of the many red flags we observed.3. What did Management really say on its most recent earnings call? - read between the linesWe spent a considerable amount of time analyzing the most recent earnings call which featured yet another McBride defense of Stamps.com's business practices.Before we analyze his commentary on the call, we think it is important to provide some context as to what McBride was facing as he approached the earnings call.First, noted short seller Marc Cohodes very publicly attacked Stamps.com's business model in a Grant's podcast, and followed up his attack with a series of tweets that effectively alleged that Stamps.com was scamming the USPS. His description of Stamps.com's relationship with the USPS involved four-letter words that we can't repeat in this PG report.Furthermore, McBride and Huebner's stock sales contributed to a significant selloff in Stamps.com shares. The combination of the pre-earnings Cohodes attack and the insider sales resulted in heightened attention from the market on the reseller program and pressure on Stamps.com's stock.Source: Craig Hallum note from March 22, 2017We note that during the same time period, market chatter began to pick up regarding whether change is coming to the reseller program. The change in Stamps.com's risk factor disclosures combined with the aggressive insider selling naturally resulted in significant short investor interest into whether something ""may be coming"" that would impair Stamps.com's ability to interact with resellers. In fact, based on a question posed by Darren Aftahi of Roth, it is clear that a rumor circulated in the market that claimed the USPS had sent a letter to resellers suggesting some form of changes were coming to the reseller program.Therefore, as Mr. McBride approached his earnings call, he knew that he was going to face a firing squad given all of the controversy he faced going into the call.If McBride was confident that the USPS was not currently contemplating changes to the reseller program, all McBride had to do was very loudly and clearly say that the USPS was not contemplating any changes to the reseller program. However, in our view, his behavior on the earnings calls projects a very different idea, namely, that the USPS is in fact currently evaluating changes to the reseller program.In our view, McBride ultimately used the earnings call as a public forum opportunity to lobby the USPS against making any changes that could damage Stamps.com's business.As he covered the topic of resellers, McBride reminded investors and the USPS that Stamps.com had spent over $1.5 billion on the USPS over the past few years. We found this comment particularly laughable, as McBride effectively tried to convince the USPS that it should be grateful for all of Stamps.com's opex spend over the past several years, including the opex related to generally running the business and paying out hefty compensation packages to executives. We not only find this comparison intellectually dishonest - we find it offensive to the employees and stakeholders of the USPS.As recently as March 2017, Congressman Jason Chaffetz of the House Oversight Committee warned that the USPS was on the verge of a taxpayer funded bailout:Source: HereTherefore, while Mr. McBride has tried to downplay concerns over his use of resellers by arguing that the USPS is not taxpayer funded (see the 2Q16 earnings call), how do you as a taxpayer feel about Stamps.com executives cashing in tens of millions of stock at the expense of the USPS while you, the taxpayer, are on the hook for a potential USPS bailout? And how do senior USPS executives feel about this dynamic? Time will tell.While we had a good laugh at McBride's ingenuity in trying to justify his company's relevance with creative math, the comment also provides an important glimpse into how McBride approached the call. He clearly viewed it as important to portray Stamps.com as an important partner to the USPS. In our view, by drawing attention to Stamps.com's purported ""investment"" and its alleged impact on USPS's volumes, he went as far as effectively insinuating that the USPS was at risk of losing volumes should it make any changes to the reseller program.This is NOT the tone of someone who is very comfortable with his regulatory relations. Rather, we view this as the tone of someone who is attempting to control the narrative.It is important to draw a distinction between how the USPS views Stamps.com's relationship with the USPS and how the USPS views Stamps.com's relationship with resellers. We therefore note that in the highly scripted remarks, McBride never once said that the USPS was comfortable with the reseller program generally:Source: Seeking Alpha STMP TranscriptWhile some readers may argue that we are nitpicking, we remind you that Stamps.com is a company that did not deem it appropriate to disclose settlements with state Attorneys General regarding deceptive business practices. Therefore, reading between the lines matters. Nowhere in McBride's prepared remarks did he say anything about how the USPS views the reseller program. And for investors who actually understand the ""short case"" on Stamps.com, it revolves NOT around the relationship between Stamps.com and the USPS, but rather, around how Stamps.com interacts with the three major postage resellers - Intuiship, Express One, and Parcel Partners.And in the Q&A section of the call, when McBride appears to have been surprised with a question from Darren Aftahi about a ""letter sent to resellers,"" we note that McBride continued to push the notion that the USPS would potentially ""lose"" something if they make any changes to the reseller program. In this segment of the call, he basically rhetorically asked why the USPS would make changes to a program that is ""growing twice the industry rate."" We viewed his language as a veiled attempt to talk the USPS out of making changes to the reseller program, which we believe suggests that McBride may possess knowledge about pending changes to the reseller program:The most telling thing in McBride's reply to Aftahi was his use of the term ""major change."" In light of that careful wording, we believe it is abundantly clear the McBride is aware of some form of changes. We simply think that upon consultation with counsel, he felt the need to include the term ""major"" to downplay the significance of the coming change as best he could.So all McBride needs to do is come out and tell us whether or not he expects ANY change to the reseller program - whether ""major"" or not. Our research associate reached out to Stamps.com for comment and clarification on this topic, but Stamps.com did not reply to our request for comment.We also want to further analyze the denial of the ""letter"" on the call.HERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT DARREN AFTAHI'S QUESTION:Any letter to resellers by DEFINITION would not have been addressed to Stamps.com itself. Stamps.com is not a reseller. We believe that only three companies could have possibly received copies of any hypothetical letter - Intuiship, Parcel Partners, and Express One. So we think it is important to note that Darren Aftahi's question did NOT ask McBride whether or not the resellers received a letter. It actually asked whether or not Stamps.com received the said letter. If the letter does exist, Stamps.com by definition should not have received it given the company IS NOT a reseller:Source: Seeking Alpha transcript (we viewed ""what are"" as a typo after reviewing the call recording and modified it to ""whether"")So did McBride yet again have fun with words here?McBride did not once deny that the USPS is evaluating changes to the reseller program. In fact, he simply claimed they were not ""major changes."" He also never denied that the resellers received some form of letter. He appears to have only denied that Stamps.com received the letter, which is a no-brainer.When McBride had the opportunity to refute the notion that any change to the reseller program is coming he did not. Instead, he played down the significance of any changes by changing the topic and complaining about short sellers (""strategies with our stock""). When we had our research associate reach out to Stamps.com for comment, the company ignored our request for comment. Instead, the company continues to meet with investors in private settings and continues to discuss its business practices outside of the realm of the public eye.If you carefully analyze McBride's words on the conference call, the story becomes clearer. He had the opportunity to shoot down the idea that there is change coming to the reseller program. He didn't. Instead he changed the topic, ""lobbied"" the USPS, and then pulled the age-old trick of ""blaming the shorts.""We also note that a recent tweet that includes the header of a recent Capitol Forum report appears to corroborate our view the USPS is currently evaluating a change in the USPS reseller program:Source: Twitter, Capitol ForumDue to copyright issues and out of respect to the Capitol Forum, we cannot provide a full copy of Capitol Forum's report. We did have a chance to review it and encourage all interested parties to subscribe to Capitol Forum. Capitol Forum's piece referenced in the Cohodes tweet references an interview with an industry insider with intimate knowledge of the reseller program and that individual's opinion on how the USPS is currently thinking about the reseller program.We also wondered whether anyone had publicly defended Stamps.com's use of resellers - other than shareholders and management. We went through Stamps.com's earnings calls and found that the only apparent defender of Stamps.com's business practices has been a former PRC chairperson with a checkered past.On a November 2016 earnings call, Mr. McBride repeatedly referenced a call -- that a call that was hosted by B. Riley (the brokerage house that is ~10% owned by Stamps.com Board member and significant shareholder Lloyd Miller). The call featured Ruth Goldway, who according to Mr. McBride's account of the call, defended Stamps.com's use of resellers, and the reseller program more broadly. We encourage you to review the transcript.Ms. Goldway was the former chair of the Postal Regulatory Commission. Her background made her the ideal person for Stamps.com to use to try and defend its business practices. We also surmise that she has become a pivotal figure for shareholders to get comfortable with Stamps.com's business practices. We find the practice of Stamps.com endorsing a B. Riley hosted call with Ruth Goldway as a rather troubling fact pattern (particularly given the RILY ownership overlap with STMP's Board), but will not harp on that.Rather, we ask one simple question. When faced with accusations of government waste, who at Stamps.com thought it was a great idea to enlist the aid of an individual who herself was mired in allegations of government waste?Ms. Goldway came under intense scrutiny for her aggressive travel spend as the USPS financially languished. This 2012 Washington Post story provides an interview between the WaPo and Goldway in which she defended her travel to Beijing (because, the Americans have a lot to learn from the Scottish in terms of how to manufacture envelopes…we wish we were kidding here, but we're quoting out of the article). While she stood by her extensive travel spend for several years, Ms. Goldway was ultimately removed from office in 2014.These things matter. The reseller programs rose to prominence while Ms. Goldway was traveling to Scottland to learn about how to make better envelopes. This causes us to wonder - could it be possible that if Ms. Goldway was spending less time on postal envelope origami and more time on USPS contracts, perhaps the Stamps.com reseller debacle would have never come to fruition in the first place? Her defense of the program therefore needs to be viewed with a very skeptical eye.Finally, if all of those red flags were not enough we leave you with one parting question. If the USPS really was so comfortable with how Stamps.com uses resellers, then why is the USPS not directly paying Stamps.com? We note Stamps.com claims to have a strong relationship with the USPS, yet nonetheless, the USPS is not listed as a 10% customer for Stamps.com.We had our research associate reach out to Stamps.com IR for comment on how the company accounts for the revenues earned through the reseller arrangements and did not receive a response to our request for comment.ConclusionThis table is why all of this report matters and why changes to the reseller program matter. It represents ~65%+ of Stamps.com's EBITDA based on our calculations!Source: Friendly Bear analysisAnd yes, we used a 100% margin on the EBITDA from reseller dollars. While Mr. McBride has denied that a 100% EBITDA margin is the appropriate margin assumption to use for skimmed reseller monetized postage, we refuse to acknowledge the idea that compensation packages to STMP insiders and general STMP opex constitutes a genuine investment expense against reseller dollars. THERE IS NO GENUINE COST to reseller monetized postage profits. We challenge Stamps.com management to publicly provide an itemized list of the purported ""investments"" the company has to spend on an ongoing basis to support skimming money off resellers…We have also talked to numerous sources that claim Stamps.com management has allegedly been openly admitting that reseller arrangements are a material contributor to the company's earnings (behind closed doors).We gave the company ample opportunity to refute this characterization and the company did not respond. Our research associate even received read receipts from the company's IR team confirming that they received our emailed questions.We also advise investors to tread carefully in light of the recent stock strength. The most troubling thing we have seen is the aggressive amount of Stamps.com stock being traded by Goldman Sachs over the past few days:Source: BloombergGoldman Sachs recently hosted a non-deal roadshow for Stamps.com. As a bank that does not currently cover STMP stock, we suspect that Goldman would expect payment in some form in exchange for roadshow coverage…i.e. in the form of managing a company's $90 million buyback. We therefore note that Goldman's presence in the order book for Stamps.com is a huge red flag given that Goldman has not historically been a particularly heavy trader of Stamps.com stock (in 2016, Goldman flow ranked #6 according to Bloomberg data). So this begs the question… is Stamps.com management using its buyback to prop the stock up ahead of a negative news announcement?Source: BloombergSo in conclusion, we leave readers with a summary of the ugly mosaic surrounding Stamps.com:We see this as a classic example of a management team that has ""co-opted"" the longs, giving them comfort on a daily basis by holding their hands. However, as we saw after Mike Pearson's infamous selective ""bullish analyst"" calls from March 2016, more often than not, when a management team spends all of its time comforting the longs, the end result for shareholders is the slaughterhouse."

All figures are current as of the entry's submission - the contest deadline was April 22, 2016).Ira Sohn Research Conference Foundation - Investment Idea ContestRecommendation: Short Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP)Price when report was submitted (4/13/16): $95.79Target Price: $62.60Expected Return: 35%1-Year3-YearSource: MorningstarBusiness Background:Stamps.com was founded in 1998 and was one of the first companies to receive approval from the US Postal Service to allow them to sell postage over the internet. In addition to providing postal stamps, they also provide shipping solutions. They allow users to sign up and print stamps or shipping labels for mailing with a computer, printer, and internet connection.The process works by the customer first registering an account on their website and downloading their software. The customer then purchases the postage on their account and prints the postage. The amount is then deducted from a prepaid balance (Source: March 2016 Company Presentation). The customer is also able to customize their own stamps by using their own photos, designs or logos. Their target markets are small and medium-sized businesses, enterprises, home offices and online retailers.Source: Stamps.comStamps.com's stock price has increased from the low-to-mid 30s throughout most of the middle of 2014, to as high as the low 120s during March of 2016. It has since fallen back to the mid 90s as I am writing this report, but I believe the stock still has further to fall because of their lack of customer satisfaction, unfavorable medium to long-term economics of the postage business, substitute ways of getting stamps than by using Stamps.com's service, and high valuation multiples despite 2015 being a negative year for net income.The company is currently depending on acquisitions to spur growth. They are also focusing on non-GAAP results as opposed to GAAP results, which don't include stock-based compensation expense and contingent consideration charges. 2015 Non-GAAP net income was $77.15 million and 2015 GAAP net income was ($4 million). Meanwhile stock-based compensation was $17.23 million and consideration charges were $46.09 million.Stock-based compensation is pretty self-explanatory but it is a little harder to get an idea what consideration charges are, but if you look in the 2015 10-K, you can see that they are related to a form of incentive income which sounds like an actual expense to me. Here is how management describes contingent consideration charges on page 35-36 of their 2015 10-K:It is worthy to note that there were large amounts of insider sales in the first quarter of 2016 also and this will have a negative impact on earnings just as it did in 2015. At the risk of using a cliché, there is a quote from Warren Buffett that should remind investors of this déjà vu all over again, ""If stock options aren't a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn't an expense, what is it? And, if expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they go?""Reconciliation Provided by Management of Non-GAAP to GAAP Earnings for 2015Source: Stamps.com fourth Quarter 2015 Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures (2)Poor Customer Reviews:Source: Consumer Affairs Source: YelpStamps.com received poor ratings from both Yelp and Consumer Affairs. There were 16 complaints on the Consumer Affairs website during this year so far. All of these complaints are related to Stamps.com charging their customers a hidden monthly fee without them knowing, aggressive selling after a trial period, and customers having difficulty when trying to cancel the service.Most of the poor ratings, which can be seen by following the links on the last page of this report in the sources section, are attributed to consumers not being happy with Stamps.com continuing to charge them for the services after the customer tries to cancel. The customers were being charged for a monthly fee but the customers felt cheated because they didn't know about this fee.It was hidden to them and when they tried to cancel it, they were met with aggressive sales tactics to try and persuade their customers to keep the service. When you take a look at the huge build up in accounts receivable on the 2015 balance sheet, and the reduction for accounts receivable in working capital on the cash flow statement, the complaints start to make more sense. Some of this increase is likely due to the consolidation from Stamps.com's acquisition of Endicia during 2015, but it is very unlikely that this acquisition could have accounted for all of the $43 million increase in A/R because Stamps.com acquired Endicia for $250 million in cash and that would put A/R at 17% of the purchase price.Source: MorningstarSource: MorningstarLack of a Competitive Advantage:Stamps.com has competition from FedEx (NYSE:FDX), UPS (NYSE:UPS), the U.S. Postal Office, Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI) and DHL. They are a small player in the postal and shipping market with only $4.7B share of a $230B market. This makes up only 2% and makes it very difficult for them to achieve any scale to spread their fixed costs over large volumes. Customers can also simply purchase the stamps at their nearby post office or grocery store instead of ordering them online. The long-term economics aren't in this company's favor also since email has been a huge replacement for sending out letters. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other large online retailers use Fed Ex and UPS to ship goods instead of relying on services from the Post Office.Source: March 2016 Company PresentationValuation:*Market Cap for 3YA and ATH ratios is the market cap at the close of the market on 4/13/16, or $1.6 billion.The charts above show some common valuation ratios for Stamps.com. Over the last twelve months, the company lost $4 million so the P/E ratio is negative, but even if Stamps.com earned $49 million - its all-time high of net income - the P/E ratio would still be 36. 36 is a high P/E multiple to pay for even a company of quality caliber like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and they have strong economics. Stamps.com doesn't have a business model with a strong moat and long-term economics.What is also notable about these valuation metrics is the high Price/Sales ratio that the company trades for. It is down from the 10 times that it traded at for its three-year average, but it is stilling trading at a multiple of 7, which is high.Discounted Earnings Valuation Model:Estimating future earnings for this company aren't as easy as it may seem just by looking at the income statement because Stamps.com has tax benefits through net operating loss carry-forwards. These tax benefits make the company seem more profitable than it really is. On page F-27 of their 2015 10-K, Stamps.com states that they have about $123 million of NOL carry-forwards and $1.5 million for federal and state income tax purposes as of December 31, 2015 which can be carried forward. These federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2020 and their federal tax credits will begin to expire in 2018.Source: MorningstarUsing a discounted net income model and the following five-year assumptions gives a value per share of $91.08.Net Income Growth: 25% (5-year average)Net Income Margin: 23% (5-year average)Discount Rate: 10%10-Year Treasury Bond: 1.76% (Terminal year growth rate)The net income growth is based on the sustainable growth rate, which is return on equity multiplied by the retention ratio. Stamps.com doesn't pay a dividend so I used the five-year average return on equity of 25% as the growth rate. This is an optimistic assumption since it factors in the high net income margins and growth rates from the years 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 but the value of $90.90 is still below the market price on 4/13/16 of $95.79 which signals that this company is overvalued based on my conservative estimates.There were no significant expenses for stock based compensation during these years also, unlike in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. And estimates for 2016 net income of $85 million would require an astonishing growth rate of 94% from the 2013 all-time high of $44 million, which is also too optimistic.I am going to assume that Stamps.com grows along with what the analysts are predicting for industry growth over the next five years, which is 13%. Since the tax benefits don't expire, I will assume a high net profit margin of 25%, which is the average over the last five years when you exclude the loss in 2015. I will also assume a discount rate of 10% and use the 10-year Treasury bond for the slow growth period or the terminal value. This results in a value of $62.72, which would be a 35% return from the $95.70 price at the close of the market on 4/13/16.Growth: 13%Net Income Margin: 25%Discount Rate: 10%10-Year Treasury: 1.76%Catalysts:Insider sales: The biggest catalyst for my short thesis is the large amount of insider sales that have occurred over the last two months. Insider sales can give false signals at times but in Stamps.com's case, the insider sales are so overwhelming that is too difficult to avoid. There has only been one stock purchase from an insider over the last two months and an astonishing 30 sales. This is very typical of the insiders, who have a much deeper knowledge of the fundamentals and financials of the business than the outsider stockholders, understanding that the share price is way overvalued. Coming to this realization, they are bailing out of the ship. On top of all of this, there have also been 16 option exercises.*The date on which the insider initiated the transaction.Source: Morningstar; SEC.gov (5)Earnings Miss for 2016: As of now, the date that Stamps.com is expected to report earnings is May 5, 2016, but this can change at management's discretion. An earnings miss for the first quarter of 2016 will serve as a catalyst to send the stock price down to more reasonable multiples. Consensus estimates from four analysts covering this company for EPS is $1.06. This translates into expected net income of $17.71 million for the quarter which would be the second highest net income earned over the past 10 quarters.Stamps.com actually had four negative quarters of operating income out of the last five and three out of five negative quarters for net income. Meanwhile, analysts' expectations for EPS for 2016 are $5.28 according to Fidelity and Yahoo. This results in expected net income of $88 million, which would be equal to double the highest net income Stamps.com ever reported. The highest earnings they reported were $44 million in 2013.There is obviously a lot of optimism already discounted in the stock price making the stock very vulnerable to not only an earnings miss in the first quarter of 2016, but in the second, third and fourth as well. Management compensation for insider sales that are shown on page five will also increase the Sales, General and Administrative expenses line item on the income statement, which is where Stamps.com expenses stock-based compensation. This extra expense will create a headwind to beat or even meet earnings estimates as well as the overly optimistic assumptions.Source: Yahoo FinanceMarket realizes the overvaluation: With the recent pullback from around $120 a share to around $95 a share, the market seems to be catching on to this high reward and low risk opportunity for investors willing to go short. The chart below shows the increase in shares short from 4/15/2015 to 3/15/16.Source: NASDAQ.comThe price to sales multiple is at 7, which is high for a company that may advertise itself as an internet company, but it is mostly a company that sells stamps online. Also, the free cash flow multiple is at an all-time high and earnings aren't positive for 2015. Looking at the insider sales table on page five, you can see that a total of $16 million was realized from insiders selling shares. There have also been a number of option exercises too.Risk:Earnings Beat - A material rise in earnings over the next quarter can send this stock price back past the $100 mark. Management made acquisitions totaling about $284 million over the past two years and focused on Non-GAAP earnings in the last earnings call, which excluded stock-based compensation and contingent consideration charges. This along with a recent rise in the overall market level have prevented the share price from falling further, but with analysts expecting earnings to come in at an all-time high for 2016, I think it is very likely that this company will disappoint at least one of the quarters and send the stock price down toward my target price of $62.60.Conclusion:Despite rising short interest and a pullback from $120 a share to $95.79 a share, there is still opportunity left for short sellers to capture a favorable risk reward scenario by selling short shares of Stamps.com. Analyst estimates are too high for earnings per share in 2016, insiders have been continuing their sales through Q1 2016, and Stamps.com is in a competitive industry where they aren't the one with the largest moat.There are alternative ways of getting stamps and the shipping services that Stamps.com provides, plus their customer views with Yelp and Consumer Affairs have been very negative. Price multiples such as the TTM price to sales ratio is at 7 which is a high multiple to pay. Price multiples are also high when measured against the company's three-year averages, and all-time highs. My target price based on a 13% industry growth rate, 25% profit margin, 10% discount rate, and 1.76% growth rate for the terminal year result in a price target of $62.60, or a 35% return from the close of the market price on 4/13/16."

One such data point comes from a recent report published by The Capitol Forum, which quotes an intuiShip employee as stating that ""intuiShip does its entire domestic small parcel shipping through Stamps.com."" (See previous Capitol Forum citation) Another that we have identified is that its website redirects to www.stamps.com!STMP has been non-transparent with shareholders, inadequately disclosing how it derives the majority of its profitability and the likelihood it could disappear; Wall Street analysts have no clue about how STMP is actually generating the majority of its financial results (the company consistently obliterates Wall St. consensus estimates), or that the aforementioned earnings stream should not be capitalized with any real multiple. As a result, STMP has been successful in its efforts to inflate its stock price beyond reasonable measure. Based on our analysis, STMP is worth ~$15 per share, ~80% below current trading levels.STMP has found a way to ""game"" the USPS postage reseller program - Our research into Stamps.com uncovered curious and undisclosed relationships between STMP and postage reseller companies (e.g., intuiShip) that caught our attention, as the relationships emerged around the same time that Stamps.com began its 1) M&A binge, and 2) ascension to Wall Street darling status due to its consistent ability to mysteriously blow out Wall Street earnings expectations. Our research, including a review of hundreds of pages of litigation as well as a deep forensic accounting analysis, has led us to conclude that Stamps.com has found a way to ""game"" postal rates using the USPS postage reseller program.Our research indicates that Stamps.com has partnered with certain undisclosed Utah-based postage resellers in order to recharacterize low-volume shipping customers that would not qualify for USPS discounts as high-volume shipping customers that would. In doing so, we believe that Stamps.com has found a way to skim undeserved revenues off the USPS. Further, we believe that Stamps.com, using postage reseller discounts, is part of a larger scheme to buy USPS postage at discounted rates applicable to only high-volume shippers, and then resell that postage to customers at the standard marked up rate, effectively capturing an ""arb spread."" We think that this scheme results in Stamps.com massively juicing its profits despite adding no economic value to the USPS.STMP’s application of the USPS postage reseller program appears to violate the intent and purpose of this program - The USPS created the postage reseller program in 2009 to compete with FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS (NYSE:UPS). The program consisted of the USPS offering negotiated discounted rates for Priority and Express Mail through Negotiated Service Agreements (""NSAs"") to certain intermediary companies (""postage resellers""). The intent of the program was for the postage resellers to source new customers - specifically, high-volume shipping end users - for the USPS. The program was meant to benefit both the USPS and the reseller: the postage reseller would keep the difference between the price they charged the end user and the discounted rate negotiated with the USPS; in receiving new customers, the USPS would grow.We believe STMP's usage of the reseller program is abusive and cannibalistic to the USPS - Insofar as postage resellers target the high-volume shipping clients of UPS and FedEx, the USPS stands to benefit. However, our research indicates that STMP and its postage reseller affiliates (primarily intuiShip) are acquiring current USPS customers who were paying higher postage rates to the USPS (because they were not receiving postage resellers' discounts) and driving them through the reseller program, which would result in a reduction of USPS revenues and enrichment of STMP and its reseller affiliates. STMP's robust ""revenue synergies"" and ARPU spike are evidence, in our view, that Stamps.com's approach to using the reseller program is cannibalistic to the USPS. But even further, later in this report, we prove definitively that USPS resellers and Stamps.com are cannibalizing USPS volumes!Reseller NSAs are cancellable by the UPS on 30 days' notice if reviewed and found to be abusive - We have reviewed every NSA signed during the relevant period that the reseller program originated and believe that the NSAs relevant to Stamps.com's massive surge in earnings could all be cancelled with 30 days' notice.We believe the reseller program NSAs benefiting STMP are at high risk of cancellationEven if the reseller program NSAs are not cancelled, the STMP earnings stream in question is likely to fade away beginning in 2017 due to USPS's reevaluation of certain discount agreements.Reports published by The Capitol Forum on Fri, July 8, and Tues, July 12, validate our research, and have resulted in a precipitous decline in STMP stock - Last Friday, The Capitol Forum, a well-respected regulatory research firm based in Washington DC, published a research report on abuse of the USPS reseller program and STMP's involvement, corroborating our own research findings. Its report, entitled, “Stamps.com: Reliance on Negotiated Service Agreements with USPS, Relationship with intuiShip Leaves Stamps.com with Significant Regulatory Risk; USPS Can Terminate NSA with 30 Days’ Notice if Agency Finds Abuse,” delved into how STMP has potentially been taking advantage of the USPS postage reseller program in a manner that is both unsustainable and likely to draw scrutiny from postal regulators. The Capitol Forum's investigation encompassed numerous source interviews, including conversations with the Postal Regulatory Commission, which suggest that the USPS may begin looking into Stamps.com’s relationships with postage resellers.The Capitol Forum did a great job dissecting STMP’s relationships with postage resellers and regulatory risk, the firm’s area of expertise. In this report, we reveal new information and shed light on what have yet been unknowns - we provide definitive evidence Stamps.com's usage of postage reseller programs is abusive (it cannibalizes USPS volumes), we establish that the company's arrangements with postage resellers are its primary earnings stream, we estimate the financial impact that a likely regulatory action will have on its earning power, and we apply our understanding of the most realistic outcome in valuing STMP’s stock. In our view, the decline in STMP's equity has only just begun.Sell-side and STMP responses to The Capitol Forum report are misdirecting and easily refutedTo be clear, we believe the only debate left to be had on Stamps.com is whether the reseller program is cannibalistic or beneficial to the USPS:Let’s start with a couple of statements before jumping right to the punch line.From the Stamps.com Q1 2016 earnings call:From the Stamps.com 2015 10-K on postal monetization:So we know that Stamps.com's monetization comes from Priority Mail, and that by Q1 2016, STMP and its partners (Endicia, ShipStation, ShipWorks, etc.) represented 1/3 of all priority mail volumes.We also know that e-commerce is growing at 15% in Q1.So, if both the USPS and the USPS resellers (who only resell priority mail) were actually driving incremental volumes to the USPS, you would surely expect USPS Priority Mail volumes to be growing at a rather rapid pace.And that is exactly what you are seeing at USPS competitors, FDX and UPS:So if Stamps.com can make the claim to a Bloomberg reporter that ""the USPS reseller program has been successful in helping USPS generate growth in its package business” (refer to management's response to the Capital Forum report, above), you would surely expect to see growth in Priority Mail volumes at a pace similar or greater to that of UPS/FDX. However, looking at the Q1 2016 USPS 10-Q suggests something entirely different.SourceUSPS Priority Mail volumes actually declined by (0.4)% in Q1! This is a dramatic underperformance relative to its peers.Let’s say Stamps.com actually is growing USPS volumes by 10%, a similar rate that FDX is growing. This implies that its other partners are showing Priority Mail declines of almost 6%. This sure smells like cannibalization to us.This analysis definitively proves that Stamps.com's 40% organic growth in the quarter was coming entirely from postal monetization that was cannibalizing existing USPS volumes.Introduction The public research that has been disseminated on Stamps.com to date has only scratched the surface on the truth about the company’s business model. For instance, we doubt that until very recently any Stamps.com shareholder had ever heard of a little company called intuiShip.This all changed last week when The Capitol Forum, a well-respected regulatory research firm based in Washington DC, exposed how certain companies have potentially been taking advantage of the USPS postage reseller program. We too had been researching these relationships with extreme skepticism and want to commend The Capitol Forum for its in-depth primary research.We believe that our report exposes the final smoking gun that will put the nail in the coffin on the Stamps.com mystery - a stock that has somehow seen its share price and operating results skyrocket over the past few years despite facing obvious secular tailwinds. While Valeant's shareholders will always be haunted by the moment that Philidor was exposed, we believe that Stamps.com's shareholders will forever be haunted by the moment that intuiShip was exposed.Our research into Stamps.com uncovered curious and undisclosed relationships between Stamps.com and postage reseller companies that caught our attention. These relationships emerged around the same time that Stamps.com began its 1) M&A binge, and 2) ascension to Wall Street darling status due to its consistent ability to mysteriously blow out Wall Street earnings expectations. Our research, including a review of hundreds of pages of litigation as well as a deep forensic accounting analysis, has led us to conclude that Stamps.com has found a way to ""game"" postal rates using the USPS postage reseller program. Our suspicions were only bolstered by The Capitol Forum’s recent report, which included primary interviews with postal regulators and industry participants, further confirming our research.We believe that Stamps.com has partnered with certain Utah-based postage resellers as part of a scheme to characterize low-volume shipping customers that should not qualify for USPS discounts as high-volume shipping customers. In doing so, it seems that Stamps.com has found a way to skim undeserved revenues at the expense of the USPS. We suspect that Stamps.com, using postage reseller discounts, is part of a larger scheme to buy USPS postage at discounted rates intended for only high-volume shippers, and then resell that postage to customers at the standard marked up rate, effectively capturing an ""arb spread."" We think that this scheme resulted in Stamps.com massively juicing its profits despite adding no economic value to the USPS. More importantly, we view this arbitrage scheme as unsustainable and likely to fall apart in the upcoming months, with a very catastrophic effect on Stamps.com's stock price.The USPS Postage Reseller Program – Background  First, a slight bit of background for readers unfamiliar with the postage reseller program. We dive into the specific details of these arrangements later in this report, but given how crucial resellers are to understanding Stamps.com's business model, we believe it is important that we address them here.In 2009, as DHL withdrew from the United States, the USPS was looking for a way to expand its presence in the lucrative, growing e-commerce market and to compete more effectively against UPS and FedEx. With those goals, the postage reseller program was created in 2009. In addition to providing direct discounts to high volume shippers, the USPS began providing ""licenses"" (known as Negotiated Service Agreements, or NSAs) to certain intermediary companies that the USPS viewed as well positioned to source new high volume shipping clients for the USPS. These intermediary companies - known as resellers - were granted direct access to attractive postage discounts so that they could pass these discounts on to the high volume shippers they sourced with minimal friction. The resellers were to essentially be an ""outsourced"" sales force for the USPS. So, the USPS enlisted the help of three companies that already had historical ties to DHL in order to grow the USPS's e-commerce presence: Express 1, Parcel Partners, and intuiShip. They all happened to be based in Salt Lake City, Utah, just miles away from each other.Financial Results that Defy Expectation and Logic  Stamps.com has been quite the story stock. After languishing in early 2014, the company embarked on an aggressive acquisition spree that has also magically accelerated organic revenue growth. In fact, Stamps.com has not missed Wall Street's revenue expectations since its acquisition spree began in 2Q14 despite missing revenues for the three consecutive quarters before the acquisitions commenced. Even more interesting, the ""% surprise"" has only grown with time.The sheer magnitude of Stamps.com's earnings beats make clear that the company is doing something that is not fully appreciable to investors. Despite being a ""Software as a Service"" (SaaS) business that monetizes through a monthly and recurring credit card charge to customers, Stamps.com's financial results appear to exhibit none of the predictable and tight range characteristics that one expects in the world of SaaS stocks.We think it is worth staring at Stamps.com's ""earnings surprise history"" over the past several quarters as it tells the tale of a company that was somehow able to use an M&A spree that began c. mid-2014 to turn itself into one of Wall Street's greatest ""beat and raise"" stories.As an aside, STMP's stock price reaction to its Q1 2016 earnings report is noteworthy. After initially surging 18% on yet another quarter of the ""beat and raise"" story, Stamps.com ended up closing the day down. Following a number of high-profile blow-ups in ""beat and raise"" story stocks that rely on opaque disclosures designed around a roll-up strategy (i.e. Valeant Pharmaceuticals), investors have grown far more skittish of companies that are not providing full and transparent disclosures to investors and are less willing to blindly buy into fruit ""roll-up accounting magic.""Cracking the Nut: How Stamps.com is Printing Money We focused our research on understanding why Stamps.com's ARPUs have gone through the roof ever since mid-2014, when it initiated an acquisition spree.So we began with a simple question we thought would expose the truth about Stamps.com's business model: How does a subscription-based company that operates in a competitive and highly promotional environment see its ARPU double in the span of around 18 months?Opaque Disclosures Signal Mysterious Change in Revenue Model; Also Signal Something to Hide We begin by evaluating the revenue disclosures in Stamps.com's SEC filings from the most recent annual period that preceded its acquisition spree. To summarize the below two extracts, in 2013, STMP reported that it collects a monthly fee from subscribers and a small commission directly from the USPS on certain volumes. The volumes that STMP is able to collect a commission on are predominately tied to e-commerce, so it made sense that STMP was reporting moderate ARPU increases over time, as e-commerce volumes had been growing as a percentage of total postage printed.Per the 2013 10-K:The 2013 10-K also lays out its five primary sources of revenue:In comparing STMP's 2013 revenue sources disclosures against those made in its 2015 10-K, which covered the two-year period the company had made several acquisitions, we noted that it added two new sources of revenue:So, at some point between 12/31/2013 and 12/31/2015, STMP discretely added two new, opaque revenue source disclosures, without much, if any, elaboration or explanation.Following the thread of opacity, on the Q1 2016 earnings call, management made a vague statement about STMP now having various ways to monetize postage volume. Of course, it gave no further elaboration and not a single sell side analyst asked what it meant.We believe as we will show throughout the remainder of the report:The Ecosystem Driving STMP's New Sources of Revenue Identifying how Stamps.com is generating its numbers (i.e., identifying the entities involved, how they relate to one another and to STMP, understanding the flow of economics, etc., etc.) has been extraordinarily laborious. The ecosystem behind it all is so complex with so many moving parts that it is a doozy to explain, so bear with us! Of course, this complexity is exactly what why long investors have no clue what they actually own and no investor before us has been able to solve the STMP mystery.To help readers follow along, the schematic at right describes the primary companies involved and our interpretation of their roles in this ecosystem:An extensive review of Stamps.com's SEC filings and earnings call transcripts does not give investors any clues as to who these postage reseller partners are, how their business models work, or their relationships (or existence thereof) with STMP, with one exception: a single mention of Express 1 buried in the landfill of STMP's August 7, 2015, 10-Q would send us on the journey of reviewing piles and piles of legal filings, eventually leading us to a hard-earned comprehension of the complex world of postal discounts.Exposing the Relationship Dynamic of the Integral Players Why would Stamps.com pay Express 1, a ""partner"" that had previously never been disclosed in any filings, a massive $10M settlement =~18% of LTM EBITDA??? And why was Express 1 suing ShipStation for breach of exclusivity? What exclusivity did ShipStation give it?Searching for the answers to these questions, we combed through hundreds of pages of litigation. There were two lawsuits of focus, and through these, we were exposed to the world of USPS resellers and their complex relationships with PC postage providers: Rapid Enterprises (i.e., Express 1) v. Auctane (i.e., ShipStation) and PSI Systems (i.e., Endicia) v. Auctane. We encourage readers to pull both lawsuits and review each of them.STMP Identifies the Revenue Potential of the Reseller Scheme; USPS Left Holding the Bag Our research has led us to conclude that, as is the case with many other ideas that were generated out of the US government, the entire postage reseller industry is yet another example of a government idea that started off in the right spirit, but has ended up being totally abused.In what we believe is an act of sheer laziness, the postage resellers that were initially provided with special discounts and tasked with going out to find high volume shippers took a ""short cut."" The ""short cut"" involved letting Stamps.com ""borrow"" its discounts. The postage resellers found a quick way to avoid doing any work by relying on Stamps.com's shipping volume to meet USPS quotas. Stamps.com found a way to use its clout and negotiating leverage to extract a substantial piece of the discount economics from the resellers and as a result ""created"" a whole new source of revenue for its business model. We believe STMP provides only the most opaque of disclosures regarding this newly created revenue source because it does not want to ""kill the goose that lays the golden egg,"" by exposing the absurdity of this arrangement to the public and to the USPS.Our analysis/interpretation (depicted in the illustration below) of the relationship between Stamps.com, the USPS, and postage resellers, shows that the USPS is the one left ""holding the bag."" The USPS is providing ""discounts"" that were intended to go to end-customers that ship in high volume but are instead getting gobbled up by tiny postage resellers and Stamps.com. In this way, the USPS is effectively losing revenues by allowing Stamps.com to arbitrage postal rates. In our illustrative example, instead of collecting the $4.90, it should have been collecting per package, by inserting the reseller, the USPS only collects $4.00 for a package the seller was already going to send via USPS.Same shipper. Same set of packages. Same volumes. The only difference is that by inserting a reseller into the value-chain, the reseller and Stamps.com are able to take a significant chunk of the revenues that the USPS should have been collecting. Stamps.com has effectively found a way to supercharge its growth at the expense of the USPS - in our view, without creating any value whatsoever for the USPS.STMP Puts the Revenue Scheme on Steroids, Becomes Serial Acquirer of Multi-Carrier Shipping Platforms We believe that in realizing the revenue potential of this scheme at some point in 2014, STMP began aggressively acquiring multi-carrier shipping platforms (i.e., ShipStation, ShipWorks, and now ShippingEasy) so that it could push more and more volume into the postage reseller schemes. The more volume pushed through the reseller, the more revenue for STMP. In doing this, Stamps.com is able to skim more and more revenue off the USPS, as depicted in the illustration below. In turn, the USPS is leaving money on the table, as the volumes that Stamps.com is bringing to the USPS are not incremental, but simply just a reclassification of the same volumes the USPS was already seeing.More Steroids: STMP Allegedly Uses New-Found Negotiating Leverage to Extort Reseller Partners Based on our analysis, not only is Stamps.com acquiring shipping companies in order to run the acquired postage volumes through the reseller network, but it also began allegedly using its newfound negotiating leverage (derived from essentially rolling up the entire shipping industry) to ""extort"" the reseller industry. In the deposition extracts presented below, Express 1 (referred to as Mr. Clark) felt extorted after Stamps.com bought ShipStation. Clark accused Stamps.com of trying to ""extort"" a larger chunk of economics out of Express 1, and then ultimately moving its business away from Express 1 to a different reseller, one that we believe agreed to give STMP a larger percentage reseller discount revenue-sharing arrangement.The above deposition references a 50/50 revenue split between Express 1 and Stamps.com. Referring back to our earlier illustrative example, this would mean that by using Express 1, Stamps.com would collect ~42.5c of revenue per package instead of the 10c if it printed the label directly from the USPS. That is a 4x increase in postage monetization for Stamps.com! Now the ARPU increases are starting to make sense. Based on our analysis, Stamps.com has truly masterminded a way to maximize the amount of revenue it is extracting from the USPS.Enter intuiShip Based on our review of the aforementioned litigation and our investigation into Stamps.com's current integration partnerships, we believe that STMP ultimately materially reduced its relationship with Express 1, and switched a significant chunk of its previous Express 1 volumes over to a company called intuiShip. We suspect that this switch was driven by economic motivations, given that Express 1 appears to have been unwilling to fork over a larger revenue share to Stamps.com (based on the deposition cited above) and given that Stamps.com ultimately settled its breach of contract lawsuit with Express 1 to the tune of $10 million.Our suspicion is bolstered by the lack of any mention of Express 1 on Stamps.com's current ""Integration Partners"" page. However, Stamps.com lists both intuiShip and Parcel Partners, the two other Utah-based USPS resellers, as key integration partners on its website (refer to screen clipping below).By switching integration partners from Express 1 to intuiShip, we believe that Stamps.com was able to further monetize postage volumes by extracting a larger share of the ""reseller discount"" out of intuiShip than it was previously receiving from Express 1. In the illustrative example below, changing the revenue share % that Stamps.com collects has a dramatic increase on monetization. For example, if Stamps.com now gets 80% from intuiShip instead of the 50% it received from Express 1 previously, it can increase its monetization to 68c per package vs. the 42.5c we suspect it received from Express 1 and the meager 10c it would have received had it continued to work directly with the USPS.Stamps.com is happy because it now collects 7x the monetization it would have received had it been working directly with the USPS. intuiShip is happy because, without doing an ounce of work, it is collecting 20% of the spread for volumes it would not have gotten without its relationship with Stamps.com and can play golf all day. This arrangement would also permit intuiShip to maintain its volume requirements that it is contractually obligated to provide to the USPS in order to maintain its reseller license. Express 1 is happy because its less than handful of key employees received a $10M settlement check from Stamps.com. The USPS, and with it the US taxpayer, remains the only loser in a program it created to be the winner.To further drive its ability to collect revenue share arrangements with these resellers, Stamps.com has embarked on additional acquisitions (ShipStation, ShipWorks, Endicia and now ShippingEasy) where the company is paying extremely high valuations (often in the range of 5-10x revenues) for what we believe are barely profitable companies. On face value, none of the acquisitions Stamps.com has done make much economic sense from a valuation perspective. Yet, after Stamps.com makes these acquisitions, margins just go up and up. We believe that Stamps.com is running all of these acquired volumes through intuiShip in order to create significant revenue synergies that allow it to pay such high multiples for these companies.However, there is a major flaw in this argument. The USPS already gave Stamps.com a highly, highly valuable contract. Let's be completely clear: without its USPS contract, Stamps.com does not have a business model. Stamps.com is one of three companies that have a PC Postage license and after acquiring Endicia, one of two companies. Stamps.com is already highly incented to drive volumes to the USPS because STMP is its only partner. That is why the USPS pays Stamps.com a small commission on Priority Mail volumes. We think Stamps.com has found a loophole to monetize postage that could go away with the stroke of a pen.STMP and intuiShip: One and the Same? In a vein similar to VRX and Philidor, no one has ever talked about intuiShip in the same conversation as Stamps.com despite the fact that the two companies appear to be joined at the hip. In fact, intuiShip and Stamps.com are so closely tied that we have to wonder if they are not just the same company. However, we think that Stamps.com has gone out of its way to maintain accounting separation from intuiShip because it does not want to draw attention to its reseller discount scheme (Drawing more attention to this scheme is likely to cause the USPS OIG to look much deeper into the value of these reseller arrangements and where the dollars are flowing).For the following three reasons, we think that intuiShip may very well just be a front for Stamps.com and a means for STMP to tap into lucrative USPS volume discounts without drawing attention to itself:1. We note that when you attempt to sign up for an intuiShip account, you are merely redirected to a Stamps.com landing page with a Stamps.com domain name:Source: intuiShip and Stamps.com 2. We note that Stamps.com and intuiShip cobrand their volume shipping discount materials, strongly suggesting that Stamps.com and intuiShip's business relationship goes far beyond a ""partnership."" We think that Stamps.com is simply ""borrowing"" intuiShip's legacy NSA contract rates in order to skim revenues:3. Finally, further cementing our view that intuiShip and Stamps.com essentially operate ""as one,"" we again cite the following quote from The Capitol Forum’s note:The Reseller Program NSAs Benefiting STMP are at High Risk of Cancellation As demonstrated in this report, the USPS is the only loser in a program it created for its own benefit, and thereby the benefit of the US taxpayer. So, readers naturally must be wondering why the USPS allows this scheme to continue. We believe the USPS is not fully aware of the extent of the postage reseller scheme, and that as a result of our exposure of the matter, the USPS will put an end to it.The USPS Does Not Want STMP to Monetize Postage in this Way We think the below voicemail left by Colby Clark of Express 1 and Jason Hodges of ShipStation explains why Stamps.com has been so secretive about the incremental revenue stream it derives from the reseller scheme. Because the USPS doesn't want it to be doing this! The voicemail below clearly states that Express 1 gave a promise to a VP of the USPS that it wouldn't work with Stamps.com to provide STMP discounts.From another angle, if the USPS would allow it, wouldn't you think that STMP would pursue its own USPS NSA, enabling it to collect the entire spread (as opposed to having to split it with intuiShip)? Conversely, if the USPS wanted Stamps.com to be monetizing postage in this way, we would think it would grant STMP an NSA to collect the spread for itself.We think it's obvious that the USPS does not want Stamps.com to be monetizing postage in this way; yet, STMP is. For this reason, we are of the belief the USPS would act to shut down STMP's access to the postage arb scheme, if it were made aware of it existed.Postage Reseller NSAs are Being Abused to Cannibalize USPS Volumes Postage resellers industry has no reason to exist in our view, and may not for long.In 2013, the USPS Office of Inspector General reviewed domestic NSAs and concluded that it is inconclusive if NSAs are actually beneficial to USPS, and, subsequently, tax payers.Since this 2013 assessment, as we have thoroughly laid out in this report, things have gotten a lot worse. Our analysis indicates reseller NSAs are being used to profit at the USPS expense. We should note our belief that Stamps.com is equally complicit in this scheme, which as we've shown results in the cannibalization of USPS volumes. Based on our analysis, we have formed the view that Stamps.com has become the power player in the abuse of reseller NSA contracts, enabled further by the negotiating leverage bestowed upon it by its acquisition spree. Regardless of who is to blame, we believe neither the postage resellers nor Stamps.com are creating any incremental revenue for the USPS.The USPS has the right to exit any NSA contract with only 30 days' notice The USPS has the right to exit any NSA contract with only 30 days' notice. If the USPS is a responsible steward of tax payer money, it will do the right thing and do away with the Utah reseller program that is enriching only the few lucky participants in this postage reseller scheme that Stamps.com has manipulated.Below are a few key quotes from the Capitol Forum’s report, released last week, entitled, ""Stamps.com: Reliance on Negotiated Service Agreements with USPS, Relationship with intuiShip Leaves Stamps.com with Significant Regulatory Risk; USPS Can Terminate NSA with 30 Days' Notice if Agency Finds Abuse.""Source: J.P. Klingenberg the Deputy Director of the Postal Regulatory Commission's Office of Accountability and Compliance; Capitol Forum Report 7/8/16Source: Capitol Forum Report 7/8/16Source: Capitol Forum Report 7/8/16Even if the USPS Doesn’t End the Reseller Scheme, it is Still Likely to Fade Away in 2017 Even if the USPS doesn’t get rid of these resellers right away, the USPS has started putting plans in place that are going to significantly limit these resellers' value into the shipper marketplace. The entire reason why shippers would want to use intuiShip or why Stamps.com likes to partner with intuiShip (other than the revenue share arrangement) is that intuiShip can offer Commercial Plus pricing to anyone, irrespective of the shipper's volume. These rates are 3-8% lower than that of Commercial Base pricing, which is what Stamps.com can offer its customers if it does not use a reseller.But perhaps the most damning piece of information out there to the postage reseller industry is that the USPS is considering getting rid of the Commercial Plus category at some point in 2017. This would effectively get rid of the reseller arbitrage scheme because there would be only one set of commercial rate tables available to companies such as postage resellers. That would mean that in order to get a discount, high volume shippers would get their own NSA agreement from the USPS, cutting out the Utah-based resellers and would deliver a crushing blow to Stamps.com’s key revenue stream.At a minimum, the very high value shippers at Stamps.com will cut out intuiShip and get their own discount from the USPS, putting significant pressure on this stream of earnings. There is also a significant chance that getting rid of commercial plus pricing also leads to the USPS getting rid of these reseller arrangements altogether.We note that even Stamps.com has subtly acknowledged the risk of its business model imploding in the event the USPS does away with what we view as economically nonsensical discount arrangements.In March 2014, Stamps.com added the following highlighted language into its risk factor disclosures in its 10-K:The use of the term ""unlawful"" is noteworthy. As astute readers of financial statements will appreciate, heavily lawyered risk factors in SEC filings are carefully vetted. Therefore, we take the use of the term ""unlawful"" to mean that Stamps.com itself acknowledges that its activities are akin to loophole exploitation and fraught with risk.Given the aforementioned notice from the Postal Regulatory Commission suggesting that the USPS intends on doing away with commercial pricing discounts starting in 2017, we believe that this risk factor disclosure is an ominous sign of earnings impairments on the horizon for Stamps.com.We Estimate STMP is at Risk of Losing >60% and >25% of EBITDA and Revenue, Respectively Through two different methodologies, we took a stab at quantifying just how much the postage discount and associated partner revenue share are worth for Stamps.com's business model.Methodology #1 - ARPU Growth One simple way to triangulate to these figures is to just look at the ARPU growth at Stamps.com and parse out the unexplained portion. The monthly subscription fees associated with Stamps.com and all of the companies it has acquired are readily available through Internet searches. For example, the most popular plan on ShipStation costs around $65/month. We also know from the company's own SEC filings that the change to its revenues - and ""postage monetization scheme"" - only appear to have begun hitting the numbers starting in FY2014. Therefore, we simply ""bridged the gap"" between the reported ARPU in 1Q14 and the reported ARPU in 1Q16 in an effort to determine how much of the ARPU lift came as a result of the postage monetization scheme.Methodology #2 – Revenue Growth Another simple way to triangulate to these figures is to look at the revenue growth at Stamps.com and parse out the unexplained portion. By assuming run rate revenue growth estimates for Stamps.com's legacy business, ShipStation/ShipWorks, and Endicia based on STMP's SEC filings and investor presentations, we can arrive at an unexplained revenue estimate representing the company's USPS NSA revenues (26% of the total company revenues in 1Q16). By applying this same mix (26%) to our estimate of Endicia's 1Q16 revenues, we arrive at an estimate of $21M of total USPS NSA revenues for Stamps.com in 1Q16, which equates to 61% of its total 1Q16 Adj. EBITDA.It is likely our analyses are highly conservative given 1) allocating ShipStation/ShipWorks USPS NSA revenues to Stamps.com and, thus, excluding potential ShipStation/ShipWorks USPS NSA revenues and 2) assuming Endicia's USPS NSA revenue mix is equal to Stamps.com, which is highly conservative given Endicia's focus on shippers.Below is backup analysis for our 1Q16 revenue contribution assumptions for ShipStation/ShipWorks and Endicia based on Stamps.com SEC filings and investor presentations.Two separate sets of conservative analyses show >60% and >25% of Stamps.com's 1Q16 EBITDA and revenues, respectively, have come from the postage arbitrage scheme we identified earlier. What is most notable about this is that there are obviously no expenses against this scheme. These are arbitrage profits that should flow through at 100% margins.Therefore, extrapolating our analysis to EBITDA, we believe that ~65% of 1Q16 EBITDA came as a result of the postage monetization scheme. In other words, most of Stamps.com’s earnings growth has come as a result of the company finding an ability to monetize postage.Why is this a problem? Because we believe this is a very low-quality earnings stream that the USPS itself has publicly acknowledged should go away starting in 2017. In our view, this earnings stream should never have existed, as it is merely Stamps.com having found a way to arbitrage the USPS. Once the USPS gets wiser on this practice and begins to review its discount price offerings, we believe that this earnings stream could simply vanish.We prepared the bridge below to show the impact to Stamps.com revenue if the USPS does in fact do away with the postage arbitrage scheme beginning in 2017:We Believe There is at Least 80% Downside in Stamps.com's Share Price We think shareholders of Stamps.com are ascribing a gigantic multiple to an earnings stream that could easily vanish next year - and that the USPS has publicly acknowledged should vanish next year.From a valuation perspective, we are quite challenged at how to value a company that could lose ~65% with a simple 30 days' notice. Though Wall Street views Stamps.com as a ""play on e-commerce,"" we conservatively apply Bloomberg Consensus EBITDA multiples for Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI) and Neopost (OTCPK:NPACY) [EPA:NEO] to a discounted Stamps.com CY17 EBITDA figure based on 1) STMP's current Bloomberg consensus EBITDA estimates 2) the potential EBITDA discount if the USPS NSA contracts were to be reconstructed. Stamps.com, PBI, and NEO are all exposed to the same end-markets; however, it may not be fair to apply such a high multiple (6.1x forward EBITDA) to an unstable earnings stream. As such, our price target could prove to be conservative.Adjusting out the portion of earnings that we view as likely to go away should the USPS restructure its pricing program, we arrive at a target price for Stamps.com of $15/sh, reflecting >80% downside from current levels."

Riley conference that its business was already in compliance with government settlements as of 2Q/3Q15.We have found another instance in which we think management is being less than truthful - namely, in claiming a 40% organic growth rate that we view as massively overstated.Historical tweaks to relationships between ShipStation/ShipWorks and Endicia help explain why Stamps.com put up too-good-to-be-true organic growth results in 1Q16.The aforementioned impact sunsets in 2Q16 and will be layered on top of spiking churn from the newly added online cancellation mechanism that will cause this stock to get pummeled.","One of the Friendly Bear's favorite late night TV sketches is ""Mean Tweets"" by Jimmy Kimmel. In the segment, famous people (i.e., athletes, celebrities, etc.) read aloud critical tweets from the public. One thing is clear from the segment - it is hard being famous. The Twittersphere masses are ever ready to bash an athlete for missing a clutch shot or an actor for having funny shaped ears.Oftentimes, being a blogging short seller is just as hard as being a celebrity. Following Stamps.com's (NASDAQ:STMP) headline 1Q16 ""beat"", the Friendly Bear was prepared for a ""Mean Tweet"" onslaught of internet message board hate. Despite his instincts telling him otherwise, the Friendly Bear made the grave mistake of poking around the comments section of his last article to get a pulse for how the masses were reacting to Stamps.com's supposedly magical quarter.So, in the spirit of Jimmy Kimmel's ""Mean Tweets"" segment, we decided to open this article by highlighting a couple of the comments that gave us a good chuckle:Source: Seeking Alpha comment sectionWhile we admire the passion and ""fecal throwing"" abilities of the commenters above, we are pleased to report that the Bear did not, in fact, impale himself in response to the most recent STMP quarter.We note that the trading activity following Stamps.com's print is quite telling, as the market itself appears to have questioned Stamps.com's ""magical"" results. Numerous commenters have reached out to the Friendly Bear to ask for his input - why in the world did Stamps.com close down after a huge beat and raise?Well, we have a piece of friendly ""Bear"" advice for the Stamps.com management team. If you're going to beat numbers by an astronomical degree and claim that your business has magically inflected to a 40%+ organic growth rate, you better explain how you achieved those results and do so in great detail. You can't just show up 15 minutes late to your own earnings call, dangle crazy numbers in front of investors, and then assume they are fools... because if you do that...... It makes it look like you are faking it somehow.Which is exactly what we think you are doing.We can now say definitively that Stamps.com has changed its website in response to our last article (proof below), which, in our view, strongly suggests that Stamps.com was in violation of the terms of its settlements with AGs prior to us exposing the disclosure problems at the company.In our view, the website tweak, combined with a recent presentation given by Stamps.com's CFO at a B. Riley conference also confirms that management was less than truthful about its historical compliance with government settlements.First, we highlight that an online cancellation mechanism has been added to the website following our April 2016 article, as clearly evidenced below.BEFORE - Screenshot of Stamps.com's Cancel Page As of Our Last Article (April 28, 2016):Keep in mind that an online customer rep confirmed back in March 2016 that the only way to cancel was via phone.We took a screenshot of the most recent version of Stamps.com's cancel page.AFTER - Screenshot of Stamps.com's Cancel Page As of June 1, 2016:Source: www.stamps.com/cancel/ retrieved as of June 1, 2016It is clear that an option to cancel has been added to the ""Account Settings"" tab of Stamps.com, indicating that the company changed the business model at some point after the publication of our article and before June 1, 2016.If it is not troubling enough that it took a short report to get a company to modify its business model and bring itself into compliance with government settlements, then the next point should be even MORE troubling.Stamps.com's CFO recently spoke at a B. Riley conference - a webcast replay of the event can be found here.The event occurred on May 26, 2016. At minute 19, the CFO discussed the government settlement. We transcribed his commentary below:Here is the only problem with what the CFO said. The CFO would have you believe that Stamps.com was already in compliance with settlements / had already made all required business modifications as of Q2/Q315, based on what he said at the B. Riley conference.However, the issue with his claim is that we KNOW the website was only changed AFTER our report was issued in April 2016 - i.e., well after 2Q/3Q15. So it appears that the earliest the business could have been in compliance would have been 2Q16. Making his claims at the B. Riley conference HIGHLY suspect.In other words...WE GOTCHA!Source: SLAMonlineBut this should come as no surprise to any rational investor. When a company called Stamps.com that has been around for over 15 years and that has consistently seen its organic growth rate plummet manages to put up a 17% revenue beat and 60%+ EPS beat in a quarter and claims this came as a result of 40%+ organic growth, there is only one phrase that comes to mind.Too good to be true.In our view, this company was bold enough to not only ignore the initial terms of the government settlement (that were supposed to have been implemented back between October 2015 and December 2015), but to go as far as ignoring the short report that called out potential non-compliance with the government settlement in April 2016. Best we can tell, the online cancellation mechanism was only added to the website at the end of May 2016.In this article, we extend our research on Stamps.com's business model and accounting practices and show that (in our view) STMP's purported organic growth rate is, in fact, too good to be true and based largely around M&A and a one-time bump related to a complicated web of intercompany relationships that has been poorly understood by the market due to weak disclosure practices.In fact, in this article, we uncover the smoking gun that we believe has allowed Stamps.com to claim an ""organic growth rate"" that, in our view, is massively overstated. In fact, we believe that the true underlying organic growth rate at Stamps.com is likely closer to a high-single digit percentage versus the 40% the company claims, and provide our analysis leading to this conclusion in this report.Stamps.com Caves and Provides Churn and Organic Growth Metrics in IR DeckAs a starting point, we note that Stamps.com recently caved on its initial reluctance to provide updated churn metrics in a recent Investor Relations deck released about a week ago. While Pollyannaish sell-side analysts cheered the churn data (which itself is highly misleading, given that Endicia has a lower churn rate than core Stamps.com and naturally drags the average lower), the most pertinent piece of information provided in the deck was the company's claim that it is growing 40% organically ex-Endicia.Stamps.com Provides ""Organic Growth"" Rate in IR Presentation with No Explanation:Source: Stamps.com Company Presentation, May 2016To this we simply say: Bollocks. The company's 40%+ claim around organic growth is so staggeringly absurd that we questioned the need to even refute it in this article.We think there is a glaring reason that this organic growth claim was left out of formal filings with the SEC. If the company could stand behind the 40%+ organic growth claim, we see no reason that this number would not have been shared in the MD&A of its most recent 10-Q. Not only was this number not shared, but a crucial ""Pro-Forma"" table that helps investors parse organic from acquired growth was also mysteriously missing.As we will show later in this report, we think the lack of disclosure of this Pro-Forma financial analysis in 1Q16, combined with the curious and mysterious history of ShipStation/ShipWorks/Endicia result in an organic growth rate at Stamps.com that is both a) impossible to properly audit given weak disclosure, and also b) far lower on a sustainable basis than the 40% claim.Stamps.com's Organic Growth Claim Makes Zero Sense Relative to Operating History:Source: SEC filings and Friendly Bear analysisOne thing is very clear. Prior to STMP going on an M&A binge, organic growth was free-falling. We have a measure of organic growth by simply looking at Stamps.com's revenue performance prior to the start of its M&A binge. In the chart above, this is the period from 1Q13 through the end of 1Q14. This period is unaffected by any material M&A, and therefore, is the only credible period we have of measuring organic growth at the company's legacy segment. It is very clear that real organic growth in what is now the legacy Stamps.com business was steadily declining.However, starting in 3Q14, ""something"" happened in the business. After the ShipStation and ShipWorks deals closed, Stamps.com's ""growth"" suddenly began exhibiting life. Mail & Shipping growth had slipped to under 4% in 1Q14, but in a sudden rush, moved above 20% by 3Q14 - as the ShipStation and ShipWorks deals hit STMP's numbers.Then ""growth"" went bananas in the period following 3Q14 - a period during which STMP became a favorite of investors playing for huge earnings beats (the period is not shown in the table). So, what in the world happened?In the process of conducting our analysis, we turned to the Pro-Forma tables provided by Stamps.com to try and analyze true ""organic"" growth versus growth coming from acquisitions. Companies provide these tables in SEC filings to help investors parse organic from acquired growth. An example of a Pro-Forma table provided by Stamps.com can be found below.Example of Pro-Forma Financials Provided in Stamps.com's 3Q14 10-Q:Source: SEC filings - 3Q14 10-QWe were in the process of going through these tables filing by filing to parse acquired from organic growth in Stamps.com's financials when we suddenly realized that a huge chunk of Pro-Forma tables were mysteriously missing from the filings, making it impossible to parse organic from acquired growth in certain time periods. In fact, starting in 1Q15, the company essentially dropped the Pro-Forma table (other than adding it back in only in the FY15 10-K, following the Endicia acquisition that closed in November 2015).Stamps.com Mysteriously Stopped Providing Detail on ShipStation/ShipWorks since 1Q15 and Failed to Provide Pro-Forma Detail on Endicia in the Most Recent Quarter:Source: Friendly Bear review of SEC FilingsWithout these Pro-Forma tables, an individual investor lacks the ability to compare year-over-year growth rates to determine organic versus inorganic growth. However, accounting rules appear to provide companies with leeway, so we were not immediately sure whether the company needed to include these tables in the 1Q15-3Q15 periods given that ShipStation and ShipWorks provided a relatively paltry amount of revenue and may not have triggered materiality issues.This is when we stumbled upon the most glaring red flag of them all. In the 1Q16 10-Q, we were surprised to discover that Stamps.com did not provide a Pro-Forma income statement schedule in its filing. Given that Endicia likely contributed ~$20M of revenues to the company's 1Q16 results (we took the ~40% ex-Endicia growth rate provided by Stamps.com and solved for implied 1Q16 Endicia revenues), we think any reasonable reader of STMP financial statements would want to see a Pro-Forma income statement. The estimated $20M of 1Q16 Endicia revenue contribution compares to Stamps.com's ex-Endicia 1Q16 revenues of ~$62M. Therefore, we have a very hard time seeing how a Pro-Forma income statement would not have been material to readers of STMP's financial statements.Yes, STMP did provide the Pro-Forma filing in the 10-K (which included only half a quarter of Endicia from 11/18/15 through 12/31/15). However, we think it had an obligation to disclose the Pro-Forma impact of Endicia in 1Q16, given it was the first FULL quarter of Endicia that the company had on record.To test our theory of whether or not STMP should have provided an Endicia Pro-Forma schedule, we turned to esteemed M&A law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Skadden Test Whether Pro-Forma Financials Are Required in Filings:Source: Skadden, Friendly Bear Graphics and own analysis to arrive at bottom right boxBased on our review of Skadden's flow chart above, we believe STMP owed investors a Pro-Forma schedule in the 1Q16 filing. Without this schedule, we don't think investors could have parsed out organic growth. Further, we don't think the company should have been making claims around its organic growth rates in IR decks absent including this schedule in SEC filings.A company with nothing to hide and which believes in full transparency would certainly have had no issue providing Pro-Forma financial statements to help readers determine organic growth. In fact, this company was even willing to go as far as providing investors with organic growth rates in an IR deck not filed with the SEC - so why not provide investors with a simple Pro-Forma income statement in the 1Q16 10-Q?In fact, we think STMP has likely intentionally avoided providing Pro-Forma income statements to investors dating all the way back to 1Q15, when it mysteriously stopped providing these in its SEC filings... and we think we know why the company has done so.In our view, Stamps.com management does not want you to know about the little trick they pulled in the ""organic growth"" number over the past four quarters that resulted in a one-time bump that the company will now begin overlapping starting in 2Q16.To explain this phenomenon, we need to turn back the clock and go back to mid-2014, when Stamps.com first began its M&A binge.At the time, STMP acquired a company called ShipStation around June 2014. A few months later, in August 2014, it acquired ShipWorks.Both of these companies had business relationships with Endicia - which, at that time (mid-2014), was a standalone company not owned by Stamps.com. Both ShipStation and ShipWorks used Endicia's API for access to USPS services.As a reminder for investors less familiar with the competitive dynamics in this space, Endicia historically directly competed with Stamps.com as an API provider (and these two players were effectively the only games in town for companies looking to tap into the USPS API).Stamps.com acquired both ShipStation and ShipWorks in mid- to late 2014, but ShipStation and ShipWorks maintained their relationships with Endicia all the way until April 1, 2015. After that point, we have found compelling evidence to suggest both companies suspended their relationships with Endicia and transitioned the relationships over to Stamps.com.Graphical Representation of Timeline Calling Revenue Synergies ""Organic Growth"":Source: Friendly Bear graphicsEvidence that ShipStation Ended its Relationship with Endicia on April 1, 2015:Source: ShipStation ForumsEvidence that ShipWorks Ended its Relationship with Endicia on April 1, 2015:Source: An Open Letter To All ShipWorks/Endicia CustomersThe industrial logic of switching away from Endicia and to Stamps.com was, at the time, a no-brainer. Historically, ShipStation and ShipWorks had to remit a portion of their revenues to Endicia in exchange for using Endicia's API. However, under Stamps.com's ownership, it made no sense to use Endicia for the API, given that this revenue could now be kept ""inside the system"" by switching from Endicia to Stamps.com as API provider.For context, ShipStation has a monthly revenue fee of around $50/month versus Stamps.com's charges of around $16/month. Even if ShipStation received some sort of volume discount for accessing Endicia's API (which we assume for the purposes of this back-of-the-envelope analysis was priced at the same rate as Stamps.com) - i.e., ShipStation's effective payment to Endicia was something more like $10/month - we are talking about a large revenue remittance that could have been reversed out of ShipStation (and ShipWorks) following the cessation of the Endicia relationship.The chart below explains how this ""shift"" goosed revenue - by taking revenues that were being remitted to Endicia and repatriating them to Stamps.com - thereby providing a bump to Stamps.com's revenues.How to Engineer ""Organic"" Revenue Growth - Disguise One-Time Revenue Synergies as Organic Growth:Source: For ILLUSTRATIVE purposes only; the numbers are for the purpose of demonstrating how revenue synergies impact results - Friendly Bear GraphicsThe big, and obvious, problem here is that the ""shift"" of ShipStation/ShipWorks payments from Endicia to Stamps.com only hits numbers ONCE, and the impact lasts for the 4 quarters following the ""changeover"". For investors familiar with GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), this is effectively similar to the ""goosing the take rate"" maneuver that GRUB employed following its IPO. However, investors familiar with that situation will also be familiar with how that story ended... at the end of the day, volume growth drives outcomes and take rates goosing is unsustainable.STMP's actual customer additions in 1Q16 were the among the worst on record relative to those in the past several 1Qs, suggesting the underlying business volume growth is, in fact, decelerating rapidly. In fact, as one would expect from the analysis we conducted, ARPU has been the saving grace for the company - an ARPU that we believe is being massively goosed by this Endicia switch-out.We think sell-side analysts owed investors a duty to ask questions about why ARPU has been magically drifting higher - WELL before Endicia hit the numbers, and well AFTER ShipStation and ShipWorks hit the numbers. In other words, ARPUs have defied logic in the interim period between the ShipStation/ShipWorks and Endicia closing - i.e., specifically 2Q15/3Q15 - strongly suggesting something has been going on with ""gross to net"" revenues at Stamps.com, supporting our thesis that this Endicia relationship switch has goosed numbers and inflated ARPU in a one-time fashion.Source: Stamps.com's ""metrics"" pages provided in the IR section of the company website.By switching ShipStation/ShipWorks from Endicia to Stamps.com, the company got a one year step-up in reported ""take rates"" - effectively through revenue synergies it achieved in the ShipStation/ShipWorks deal.Furthermore, the ""goosing"" effect was most pronounced in 1Q16 because the transition from Endicia to Stamps.com occurred on April 1, 2015, meaning 1Q15 was the last ""clean"" quarter and would have had little-to-no revenue goosing impact. This is why 1Q16 revenue ex-Endicia looked so ""strong"" on a year-over-year basis.We are not challenging that the revenue synergies are real - they most certainly are. What we are challenging is the ability of those synergies to sustain. It was a one-and-done transition, and the positive impact was most pronounced in 1Q16 (1Q15 was a clean quarter that likely included very little transition impact given April 1, 2015 implementation), and starting next quarter. the TRUE organic growth at STMP is going to begin showing - and bulls are not going to like what they see.The worst news for bulls is that the Endicia acquisition would have otherwise been a major source of revenue synergies for Stamps.com given that ShipStation/ShipWorks historically used Endicia for its API. However, given that the company already gutted the Endicia relationship with ShipStation/ShipWorks back in April 2015, the potential upside API synergies from the Endicia acquisition have been rendered moot from the perspective of ShipStation/ShipWorks.Friendly Bear Analysis of True Underlying Growth at Stamps.com:Source: Friendly Bear's own - some footnoting data is provided below. We used SEC filings, any Pro-Forma tables provided, and triangulated with Newell Rubbermaid (NASDAQ:NWL) filings regarding Endicia.We ran our own analysis of organic growth rates to try and arrive at the true underlying 2016 organic growth rate at Stamps.com. Using the data that was available in the Pro-Forma tables, we arrived at a revenue estimate of $14M of revenues in ShipStation/ShipWorks in 2014. We then assumed the business grew at ~41% in 2015, to arrive at a base 2015 revenue of ~$19.6M. The growth rate we used to get to base ShipStation/ShipWorks 2015 revenue is essentially in line with our estimate for 2014 growth. We assume the go-forward underlying growth rate of this faster-growing ShipStation/ShipWorks segment is around 30%.We then assume Stamps.com's legacy business is growing at 7%, which is in line with its growth rate back in 2Q14 - right after the ShipStation acquisition was consummated. This is likely generous given that 2Q14's 7% growth rate included some inorganic component of 2-weeks of ShipStation. Finally, given that Endicia is essentially the identical business to Stamps.com, we assume it is growing at the same pace.Blending those growth rates together and weighting them by the base 2015 revenues in each segment, we believe organic growth at Stamps.com is GENEROUSLY 9% - and as we discuss below, we think this a) ignores growing competitive risks, and b) is very generous with respect to the legacy business, which very well may be growing at something closer to 4%. We therefore believe organic growth may be as weak as 3-4% across the entire business, which calls into serious question the rich valuation of STMP.SummaryWe view the overarching narrative behind the past 2 years at Stamps.com as the following:Now that we believe we have completely debunked the purported ""organic growth"" rate from 1Q16, we challenge bulls to point to ways to win in this long... because we see almost none.However, we do see at least 10 ways you can win on this short going forward:We believe that the real underlying organic growth at Stamps.com will start doing the talking going forward... and we are quite confident the bulls are not going to like what comes next.We remain confident STMP is likely to get cut in half in the next few quarters as its organic growth prospects become more obvious, and continue to believe competitive dynamics will drive this stock to $25/share over time.On a final note, given that so many commenters alleged bias on the part of the Friendly Bear, we decided to close in a more somber mood than usual. We are proud to be short shares of STMP and to share our research with you. Our track record of identifying overvalued companies that are misrepresenting their growth prospects speaks for itself.In fact, we wonder why so many are quick to allege bias on the part of authors such as the Friendly Bear, when firms such as B. Riley that cover Stamps.com and rate the stock a ""BUY"" are not more forthcoming about the extent of their relationships with Stamps.com.Lloyd Miller, a member of Stamps.com's Board of Directors and one of its largest shareholders, also happens to be one of the largest shareholders of B. Riley - a company that rates STMP a BUY with a $150 price target. This appears like a major potential conflict of interest issue to us.We are alleging no wrongdoing on the part of either RILY or STMP, but we do believe it is important that investors who read this report understand that biases can exist on both sides of the aisle - both long and short.We therefore can only hope that the analysts at firms such as B. Riley will step up to the plate on the next earnings call and ask some of the probing questions we have outlined in both this report and our last report. We think that we have raised questions of critical importance to anyone considering an investment in Stamps.com."

We reiterate our Buy rating on STMP and our target price to $125.00.*Non-GAAP EPS: $1.57A in FY15, $4.22E in FY16 and $4.39E in FY17Quarter highlightsTotal sales in 1Q:16 were $81.8 million, providing non-GAAP net earnings of $1.72 per share. This compares to the consensus estimate of $68.7 million and $1.06 per share and our estimate pair of $67.4 million and $0.98. Sales in the quarter were boosted by an increase in Average Revenue Per User to $40.86 from $25.78 in the same quarter last year. Addition of Endicia's high-volume customers, increases in shipping volumes and improved customer retention contributed to the increase.Company DescriptionStamps.com offers on-line postage solutions to customers in the U.S. In addition to mailing and shipping through the U.S. Postal Service, the Company offers multi-carrier shipping services through its ShipStation, ShipWorks and Endicia branded platforms. Stamps.com also provides patented PhotoStamps services that allow customers to create and buy personalized postage. Stamps.com serves a mix of individual, home office, business and large commercial customers which have significant mailing and shipping requirements.Gross profit margin increased to 82.7% in the quarter compared to 78.5% in the same quarter last year. The increase was delivered largely by economies of scale. The Company generated $32.8 million in free cash flow in 1Q:16, bringing cash and equivalents to $121 million at the end of March 2016. Subsequent to quarter-end $10 million in cash was used to pay down debt, which we estimate now totals $150.7 million. Management increased sales guidance for the year 2016 to a range of $310 million to $330 million, providing non-GAAP earnings in a higher range of $6.00 to $6.50. We expect to update our earnings model shortly and revisit valuation of STMP.summary of FIRST QUARTER 2016 FINANCIAL RESULTSStamps.com delivered a dramatic upside surprise for the first quarter ending March 2016, as total revenue of $81.8 million far exceeded our estimate of $67.4 million and the consensus estimate of $68.7 million. Sales increased 86% over the same quarter last year on the addition of Endicia and its high volume shipping customers to the mix for the full quarter. Growth in demand for shipping solutions across all customer groups from small-office to low-volume shippers served by the Stamps.com, ShipStation and Shipworks solutions also contributed to the top-line increase.Revenue provided total GAAP net income of $13.2 million or $0.71 per share, also well above our expectations for GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share. The quarter GAAP net income included a laundry list of non-cash expenses, including stock compensation, amortization of intangible assets, debt issuance costs, tax expenses and acquisition expenses. Excluding these non-cash expenses, non-GAAP net income was $32.0 million or $1.72 per share compared to our non-GAAP earnings estimate of $0.98 and the consensus non-GAAP estimate of $1.06.Stamps.com has taken some criticism in recent weeks for discontinuing the publication of a 'churn rate' in customers. The addition of Endicia and its customer base of high-volume shippers had rendered that calculation no longer usable. Another performance metric that Stamps.com still reports, ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), provides some insight into revenue growth in the quarter. ARPU increased to $40.86 per month compared to $29.64 in the previous quarter and $25.78 in the year ago quarter. During the earnings conference call management cited several reasons for the remarkable improvement, including 1) addition of higher volume shippers to the customer mix, 2) growth in shipping volumes, and 3) improved customer retention among all brands.Cash and BalancesCash generated by operations was not disclosed, but free cash flow after a small investment in capital equipment was $32.8 million. Accordingly, cash at the end of March 2016, was $121.3 million, compared to $75.2 million three months ago. The board of directors apparently was as impressed as everyone else with the quarter and elected to make an extra payment of $10 million on outstanding long-term debt. Total debt was $160.7 million at the end of March 2016, and has now been reduced to an estimated $150.7 million. Additional cash will be used for the previously announced share buyback program, which was recently expanded by a $10 million incremental authorization.EstimatesWe anticipate updating our earnings model to reflect first quarter 2016 financial results and adjusting sales, cost and expense assumptions based on a mix of factors, including following:During the earnings conference call Stamps.com management laid claim to one third of USPS domestic priority postage for packages, demonstrating that the new combined operation is now a highly visible competitive force. Together the Company's solutions were used to process one billion packages in the year 2015. Management also claimed competitive advantages in the Company's postage solution portfolio compared to new solutions recently introduced by Shippo and Pitney Bowles as well as the USPS ePostage architecture for enterprise. Over-all gross margin in the quarter was 82.7%. The profit margin was 84.3% for the Mailing and Shipping segment, which provided 96% of total sales. This compares to 82.1% in the previous quarter and 80.0% in the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the Customized Postage segment, which provided the balance of revenue, improved by 100 basis points to 17.9%. Management cited economies of scale as the primary driver of margin expansion. The profit margin was well above our assumption of 79.4% combined gross profit margin for the quarter and the balance of the year. Operating expenses totaled $45 million in the quarter, representing 55% of total sales. This compares to $26.1 million in the same quarter last year and 59.2% of total sales, excluding one-time charges for $10.5 million related to a legal settlement. We believe the reduction in operating spending as a percentage of sales was largely the result of economies of scale. Additional operating savings are expected to accrue in the balance of 2016, through cost reductions and other efficiencies as the Endicia operation is integrated into Stamps.com. The Company expects to realize improved return on investment in marketing and sales of the combined postage solutions portfolio that could ultimately reduced total required budget. Management increased sales guidance for the full year 2016 to a range of $310 million to $330 million (from $290 million to $310 million). Likewise, non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in a higher range of $6.00 to $6.50 (from $5.00 to $5.50). Management also cautioned that the Company will exhibit more seasonality in quarter results with the inclusion of Endicia's high volume customers in the mix. The second and third quarters are expected to be the seasonally slow quarters.ValuationThese and other factors will inform a revision of our earnings model as well as our valuation of STMP. Our current earnings model is included here for reference purposes. We expect investors to react favorably to the upside surprise and the stock could be bid closer to our current target price of $125.00. At our target price the stock is valued at 28.0 times non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.46 for the twelve months ending March 2016."
3968884,83086,2016-04-28T08:00:00-04:00,"In 2015, Stamps.com was investigated by multiple government authorities for false and misleading advertising practices and never disclosed these investigations to investors.Stamps.com already has an egregious ~40% customer churn rate and the terms of the settlement appear to make it much harder for the company to attract and retain customers.As a result, we think Stamps.com is going to be left with insurmountable customer attrition as the government settlements force the company to modify its predatory marketing tactics.Management’s recent decision to stop disclosing churn suggests management is aware the business is going to significantly deteriorate given that the disclosure change came ""coincidentally"" right after a California settlement.UPDATE: PBI just launched (April 26) a new product that has been designed to crush Stamps.com and that completely shatters the ONLY credible bull case on Stamps.com (ShipStation).","As readers who have followed the Friendly Bear's work on BOFI will know, we specialize in dumpster diving for hidden litigation. Companies go out of their way to cover up bad news, and the biggest skeletons in the closet are often buried away in court documents that regular retail investors cannot get their hands on. Our work on Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) has spanned several months and we believe that we are on to something big - with the stock having at least 50% downside in the near-term and 75% downside in the longer-term, as a result of a busted business model that is about to see competitive dynamics intensify meaningfully, a flawed M&A strategy, and a series of undisclosed government investigations/settlements that we believe are all likely to severely limit the company's ability to grow revenues beyond 2016. We think the revelations in this report (that we believe management has been keeping hidden from investors) have the potential to send this stock plummeting.Specifically, we believe that our work shows that at least until the company comes clean about its 2015 government investigations/settlements and related business model modifications, its earnings guidance and financial statements cannot be taken seriously.Source: Seinfeld, Friendly Bear GraphicsUPDATE AS OF 4/27/16: We started investigating Stamps.com months ago when we started to suspect that the company is largely a credit card auto-renewal scheme that delivers zero value to customers. When we were about to submit our publication to Seeking Alpha, we got caught with a grand surprise - a rare gift from the short selling gods. Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI) announced a new product called ""SendPro"" on April 26. In a rare move, Pitney Bowes actually called out Stamps.com in its press release. The press release makes it quite clear that PBI is going after Stamps.com's customers including offering Stamps.com customers very aggressive extended free trial options in order to switch. We are confident that PBI is making every effort to destroy Stamps.com based on the tone of the announcement. Up until this announcement, the only credible bull case on Stamps.com was the ShipStation acquisition which appears to have been a home run for the company. That bull case has now been shattered by Pitney Bowes which has made it clear that it is going after Stamps.com. We think our research already uncovered significant and material disclosure problems at STMP (see below) that are likely to land the company in the crosshairs of more government regulators in the near-term, and we think that this news out of Pitney Bowes will destroy any concept of ongoing terminal value in Stamps.com's business model. PBI could easily take all of Stamps.com's customers at this stage, especially given the litany of consumer complaints online. Readers should also keep in mind that STMP has about 5% of the revenues of PBI yet 25% of the enterprise value. In our view, Stamps.com has never had any economic reason to exist, and the PBI announcement makes the risk of the company going away all the more real. PBI also simultaneously announced that they are opening up their USPS API to 3rd party shipping businesses. Stamps.com previously had an effective monopoly here (due to its acquisition of Endicia), but that monopoly has now run its course due to both PBI opening its API up as well as Shippo getting granted a right to USPS integration (see later in this report). In other words - Stamps.com has even less economic reason to exist today than ever. While 1Q results could look OK given the competitive entry came in April 2016, it is becoming increasingly clear to us that this company is going to fall apart in short order due to a combination of undisclosed government settlements (see below) and rapidly intensifying competition.PBI Press Release on SendPro from 4/26/16Source: Pitney BowesSituation OverviewStamps.com is the self-proclaimed leader in PC postage, claiming to have over 500,000 subscribers that pay monthly subscription fees in the range of ~$15.99 per month. These subscription fees entitle Stamps.com customers to print USPS postage from their home PCs. This $15.99 does NOT include the cost of postage - the $15.99/month is only for the right to print postage. The company also more recently made a series of acquisitions that diversified it into more of an e-commerce multi-vendor solution provider (primarily through the acquisition of ShipStation).The company was a busted 90s VC-backed IPO that languished as a forgotten microcap for years, but has now magically become a ~$1.5 billion tech ""darling."" The company is the epitome of a Web 1.0 business model (inkjet printing meets AOL-style credit card auto-renewal gimmicks) yet bulls are valuing this stock as if it is an open-ended growth story.Source: Bloomberg data for stock price chartIt is no secret that USPS postage volumes are in secular decline. Mail volume is down over 20% since 2011. Yet somehow in the same period, Stamps.com has seen its revenues more than double and its stock price rise over ~300%.Stamps.com's meteoric rise would be exemplary for any company, but is even more incredible in light of the fact that Stamps.com readily admits in its own SEC filings that its business model has no reason to exist!Source: Stamps.com 2015 10-KEmphasis:""But the services and features available at USPS.com are provided without service fees, creating a disadvantage for us because we typically charge service fees in our business model.""Translation: Only a sucker would ever knowingly pay for a Stamps.com account because you can do the same thing for FREE DIRECTLY through USPS's website.Stamps.com's crappy and useless product (in our view) results in an insanely high ~40% churn rate (i.e. a loss of almost half their customers annually), requiring the company to constantly find new suckers to buy the service in order to keep the revenue engine humming.In fact, the only credible bull case on the stock to date has been the company's shift into e-commerce through the ShipStation acquisition, but given the recent PBI and Shippo announcements, we believe the entire basis for the bull case on Stamps.com has been rendered totally and utterly irrelevant.What happens if that churn rate spikes even higher? How long would it take for Stamps.com to run out of new suckers to keep its revenue growth illusion alive? What happens when Stamps.com can't tuck in acquisitions to keep investors from finding out the truth about its anemic organic growth?Thanks to recent government legal/investigative actions from the State of California and the State of Florida (that you will find FIRST here in this report and that were NEVER disclosed by Stamps.com in SEC filings) we think Stamps.com investors will find out the chilling answer to that question very soon.Links to:People of California v. Stamps.comThe stipulated judgment and settlement from People of California v. Stamps.comThe Florida settlement against Stamps.comOur research spanning months into undisclosed Stamps.com government settlements leads us to believe that this stock is about to plummet back to the trading range where it languished for over a decade. Our near-term price target is $50 and longer-term price target is $25.Based on our review of disclosure requirements surrounding government investigations, we believe that Stamps.com has failed to disclose material government investigations/settlements to investors, which we believe is materially misleading and in violation of Item 103 of Regulation S-K. Based on the lack of disclosure, we believe that this stock is fundamentally uninvestable at least until the company comes clean about the implications of its 2015 settlements with government agencies.We expect that over the next few months, Stamps.com is going be left with massive customer attrition and negative revenue growth as new governmental orders force the company to cut back on its questionable marketing tactics causing the churn rate to skyrocket. Our research has also led us to question whether or not Stamps.com is actually in compliance with 2015 legal settlements as we show later in this report.Aggressive and Questionable Marketing Tactics and Auto-Renewals Mask Weak Underlying TrendsStamps.com aggressively markets ""free trial"" offers to prospective customers through a variety of channels (paid search, late night TV ads, and direct mailers), and requires customers to provide credit card data in order to sign-up for the free trial. However, like with many e-commerce companies, the terms of the ""free trial"" are buried so deep in the fine print that customers often miss the key stipulations. The ""free trial"" also requires customers to remember to cancel their subscription or else be faced with ongoing monthly charges from Stamps.com for a service they may never actually ever use (and which, as we already pointed out, may very well have no reason to exist). In fact, in the recent past Stamps.com has gone as far as telling prospective customers that the USPS requires Stamps.com to collect credit card information in order to convince prospective customers to hand over their digits.The internet is littered with complaints from confused customers who discovered charges from Stamps.com even though they never used the service. The complaints also detail the incredible uphill battle faced by consumers who try to cancel the service. It should come as no surprise that Stamps.com makes it as difficult as possible for consumers to cancel their subscriptions.For example:Source: Consumer AffairsAnd:Source: Consumer AffairsGiven that its service appears to have a HIGHLY questionable value proposition, it is no wonder that Stamps.com boasts one of the most absurdly high churn rates that we have ever seen from a supposed ""subscription model"" business. Up until 3Q15, Stamps.com disclosed its customer churn data, with the company operating at a ~40% annual churn rate:Stamps.com Annualized Churn RateSource: Historical monthly churn figures provided by Stamps.com through its Investor Relations website, using a 12x multiplier to arrive at annual churnLet's put a 40% annual churn rate into context. Here is a table that shows churn rates across various publicly traded software companies:Source: Cloudstrategies.bizWith a churn rate in the 40% range (an astronomically high figure as can be seen from the previous chart), even a modest increase in customer attrition would completely destroy Stamp.com's business model as it would become exponentially more expensive for Stamps.com to find new customers to replace the churned customers. Therefore, Stamps.com has to go to great lengths to hold onto its customers, which makes the stories of difficult to cancel auto-renewals unsurprising and core to Stamps.com's business model.We think longs in the stock missed the biggest red flag that accompanied the 4Q15 earnings release. Stamps.com had historically consistently provided cost per gross add (""CPGA"") and churn data to investors every quarter (for the past 10+ years!!!), but out of the blue decided to stop providing these metrics to investors starting with the 4Q15 call.We wondered - what could have possibly changed in the business since September 2015 that would suddenly make the churn data irrelevant to investors. Management provided a typical nonsense script claiming that churn was no longer a relevant metric for their business - however, this totally and utterly contradicted what the company said following the ShipStation acquisition in July 2014.Right after Government Investigations/Settlements, Management Does an About Face and Stops Disclosing Churn!!! Source: Bloomberg transcripts of Stamps.comThe Friendly Bear believes that we KNOW why management stopped providing churn…and we are about to let you in on a secret that we think management did not want you to hear about...Our research and review of recent undisclosed litigation surrounding Stamps.com leads us to believe that the reason the company is refusing to now provide churn data is linked to the fact the company neglected to appropriately disclose a recent series of government investigations/cases against the company in which multiple government agencies sued Stamps.com alleging that it has been engaging in false advertising/bait-and-switch tactics and illegal credit card auto-renewal practices.The terms of the litigation settlements required Stamps.com to materially alter its business model in ways that makes it both a) harder to attract customers, and b) harder to retain customers. The terms of the settlement were specifically set up because the government accused Stamps.com of previously utilizing false and misleading advertising practices. These settlement terms therefore should cause the company to have a harder time adding new customers and retaining customers, thereby causing a spike in churn and cost per gross customer acquired.In Stamps.com's most recent 10-K, the company discloses the following regarding ongoing legal proceedings:Source: STMP 10-KSomehow, based on our review of the past year's 10-Q's and 10-Ks, the company failed to mention two legal cases against Stamps.com that we think are of crucial importance as they both point to Stamps.com seeing a massive increase in churn in upcoming quarters which is likely to create a massive headwind to organic growth.Red Flag: We went through Stamps.com's SEC filings and found no mention whatsoever of a case from September 2015 titled: ""People of California vs. Stamps.com"" OR a 2015 settlement between the State of Florida Office of the Attorney General and Stamps.com.Government Investigation Disclosure requirements per King & SpaldingSource: King & Spalding - SEC Requirements for Disclosure/Accrual of Litigation, Governmental Proceedings and Other Loss ContingenciesGiven these cases were settled and required Stamps.com to modify its business practices, we have no idea how the company thought it was OK to not disclose these settlements with government authorities to investors.Stamps.com quickly settled both of these legal claims, agreeing to stipulations that required the company to change its business practices and website in the time period between October 2015 and December 2015 - i.e. the exact time period during which Stamps.com management suddenly changed course and stopped providing churn data.Stamps.com went as far as actually disclosing $10M of settlement expense related to the Express One settlement described in the image above (in order to conveniently add that amount back to ""adjusted earnings""), but never called out the $4M of settlement expense arising from the settlement with California regulators!Source: Sfbay.caWe think these business tweaks will wreak havoc on Stamps.com's churn rate and cause it to skyrocket. Effectively, Stamps.com just got forced to make it much easier for people to cancel subscriptions that they never needed in the first place.People of California vs. Stamps.com - Brought and settled in September 2015, (Stamps.com agreed to a $4 million settlement and business model modifications).In this case, district attorneys from Santa Clara, California sued Stamps.com in September 2015 alleging that the company engaged in false advertising regarding its free trials and improperly presented terms regarding its auto-renewal of contract policy.Stamps.com quickly settled the case for $4 million, including a $2.5 million payment to the State of California, and a $1.5 million restitution fund to disenfranchised customers.There was much more to the settlement that we believe should have been clearly disclosed by Stamps.com but somehow never made its way into the company's SEC filings.We retrieved actual copies of the court documents (all provided in links above) and discovered that Stamps.com agreed to materially alter its business model in response to the settlement with California DAs.Refer to this link for the terms of the stipulated judgment. We encourage readers to focus on pages 8 through 14 of the PDF for terms of the settlement and to also pay close attention to page 4 of the PDF which shows the CEO of Stamps.com's actual signature.In other words - in our view the agreement with district attorneys in California flipped Stamps.com's auto-renewal scam upside down, making it easier for customers to cancel Stamps.com. The settlements also make it a whole lot harder for Stamps.com to employ bait-and-switch free trial tactics to sucker customers into signing up for subscriptions.It turns out that California is not the only State that has taken issue with Stamps.com's business practices.The State of Florida also recently investigated Stamps.com, eventually resulting in Stamps.com agreeing to voluntarily change its marketing practices and business model:Prior to the legal settlements, Stamps.com already lost almost half of its customers annually. Will Stamps.com even have any customers left by the time these business modifications roll through their numbers in year end 2016?And in case you were looking for proof that Stamps.com has already started to change its business practices since the settlements - we have the irrefutable proof in this report.Hammond v. Stamps.com is a June 2015 civil lawsuit against Stamps.com (also unmentioned in SEC filings) that alleges similar claims around false advertising. In the Hammond case, the plaintiff provided a screenshot of Stamps.com's website as of June 2015:Screenshot Excerpt from Hammond Case, Prior to California Settlement (June 2015)Source: Hammond v. Stamps.com as of 6/27/2015We retrieved a more recent March 2016 screenshot of the website to compare against the Hammond screenshot:Source: Stamps.com retrieval as of 3/16/2016Update on Cancellation Mechanisms - Biggest Red Flag of them All???It would appear that Stamps.com has made some of the changes to its business model that were required as part of its settlements. However, we are not so sure if all of the changes required from the settlements have been incorporated into Stamps.com's business model. The settlement with California included the following ""compliance"" requirements, including that the settlement terms be communicated to the Board of Directors, and allowing the government to come back in and audit compliance for a period of three years:One of the conditions of the settlements that we saw was for Stamps.com to offer online cancellation mechanisms. We checked whether Stamps.com has implemented an online system for cancellation - which was one of the many terms that were part of the original compliance agreement. We checked the Stamps.com website FAQ for how to cancel and so far it appears that Stamps.com has not instituted an online cancellation mechanism:Source: http://www.stamps.com/cancel/ - as of April 2016We also connected with an online Stamps.com online live chat representative and asked whether we can cancel online and received the following response:This live chat conversation took place in March 2016. The female emoji represents the Stamps.com chat representative.Is the company already in violation of its government settlements???We encourage all readers to conduct their own due diligence into this matter.While the language in the stipulated judgment document appears to refer to a finalized agreement, including requiring an online cancellation mechanism, we are unsure if Stamps.com had the ability to appeal this stipulation. It does appear that as of the stipulated agreement (signed by the CEO of Stamps.com on page 4 of the document), the agreement was final. Therefore, this is a big question outstanding for Stamps.com - are they or are they not in violation of the online cancellation mechanism terms?If not disclosing (in our opinion) clearly material investigations/settlements with government authorities is not enough of a reason to question the bull case on Stamps.com, and Pitney Bowes coming out publicly to destroy your business isn't enough...then consider the following BONUS points:Bonus PointsCompetitive Dynamics:Competitive dynamics have also intensified meaningfully in the past few months. First, Pitney Bowes has been actively investing in their e-commerce solutions in an attempt to take back share, including in its own online competitor to Stamps.com, in an effort to take share in the lower volume space. As we outlined in our 4/27/16 update at the top of this article, PBI has essentially committed resources to taking all of Stamps.com's customers. This is more than noise - this is a complete re-rating of terminal value that does not warrant a double-digit EBITDA multiple valuation. In fact, we think option value is the best valuation you could ascribe to Stamps.com today.Also notably, Shippo was recently approved for USPS ePostage integration which makes this company a direct threat to Stamps.com. In the past, Stamps.com and Endicia (now owned by Stamps.com) were effectively the only games in town in terms of a USPS integration. Stamps.com claims in its 10-K the process for USPS approval as a PC Postage vendor is an ""extensive process"" that ""takes several years."" However, Shippo is a new company that only received a seed funding investment in September 2014 and was able to get its USPS ePostage integration completed by March 2016 - highlighting the weak barriers to entry in this industry.Shippo is also offering a very aggressively priced product that does not require ongoing subscription fees, but instead charges users 5 cents per package and integrates across all shipping providers. This disruptive model threatens Stamps.com's ability to continue to operate on a subscription based model.Aggressive M&A Also Masking Anemic Organic GrowthThe company is using the same M&A gimmicks as JCOM and DDD in order to mask anemic organic growth. Since June 2014, the company levered up to do a number of sizeable acquisitions, providing limited information on the financials of the businesses acquired. We provide an overview of the acquisition history below:And the kicker - 3 months after Stamps closed the Endicia acquisition, Etsy, a key client of Endicia, terminated its relationship with Endicia and signed a deal with the USPS directly!In total, Stamps.com spent ~$372M since June of 2014 and magically has created almost ~$1.5B in enterprise value from these low quality acquisitions.On the 4Q15 call, the CEO of the company also refused to address how much revenue contribution came from Endicia (closed in November 2015).Given the tweaks Stamps.com has likely been making to its business practices recently due to government settlements, the initial Endicia revenues could not have come at a better time for Stamps.com. What happens when Stamps.com runs out of competitors to buy?Weak GovernanceBoard governance at the top of Stamps.com is suspicious in our view. Stamps.com has a board consisting of only four individuals, none of whom appear in the least bit independent.The Chairman of the Board is the current CEO (Ken McBride). There is also a large current STMP shareholder on the Board (Lloyd Miller, who owns ~$68M of stock and has been aggressively selling since 2H15), former VCs in the deal (Brad Jones, who still owns ~$6.3M of stock), and one of the original venture capitalists / the former CEO (Mohan Ananda, ~$79M of stock).All of these individuals have hundreds of millions dollars' worth of reasons to maintain the charade of a growth story on a company that delivers little to no economic value to its customers.According to the People of California settlement, Stamps.com also agreed to provide information relating to the final judgment to senior officers of Stamps.com and to its Board of Directors.Source: People of California v. Stamps.comGiven this case was never disclosed to investors, one would imagine that it could potentially be seen as quite improper for insiders to therefore sell stock while in possession of knowledge relating to this settlement.Therefore, we note that multiple insiders (including BOD members) have sold stock hand over fist following the two government settlements.SummaryThere are red flags all over this company. Growth fueled by aggressive marketing tactics that already caught the attention of multiple government regulators, incredibly weak and misleading disclosure, questionable Board governance, and an M&A strategy that appears to be on its last leg.We believe that the magic of Stamps.com is going to soon unravel. The days of tricking unwitting customers into providing credit card information for a product they don't need, making it impossible to cancel, and then boosting growth with an aggressive roll-up of companies at nosebleed prices is going to come to an end.Ultimately, Stamps.com is a Web 1.0 company that is trading at a Web 2.0 multiple (~16x EBITDA) because it is hiding the truth about its real organic growth prospects and its predatory business model.Near-term, we expect the stock to trace back to its historical EV/EBITDA level of ~10x, or ~50% near-term downside from current levels ($50 target price).As churn spikes over the course of the year and revenues begin to roll in reverse, we expect the stock to retrace its way back to where it started before the M&A roll-up ever started. The best comp for STMP is the grab bag of Web 1.0 internet assets owned by IAC (IACI) as those are similar 90s VC-backed companies. Stamps.com is ultimately just a 90s VC backed company that has managed to create (in our view) the appearance of healthy growth through M&A and aggressive credit card auto-renewal tactics - both of which, we believe, are coming to an end. So we view similar 90s-founded legacy internet IAC businesses (like Ask Jeeves) as the appropriate comps. We think these comps will become more obvious over the next few quarters as Stamps.com's business falls apart and starts looking much more like IAC businesses.On our math, IAC (excluding its stake in Match.com) trades for ~4x EBITDA. Applying that multiple to our estimate for Stamps.com 2016 EBITDA gets to a LONG-TERM target price of $25 or 75% downside from current levels.In closing, we believe that Stamps.com needs to address why it failed to disclose material settlements with the government to investors.Even if the company has a benign explanation for the lack of disclosure, management's actions here do beg the question of why the company ""coincidentally"" stopped disclosing key customer metrics right after settling cases with the government. Anyone long this stock should be concerned about the lack of disclosure particularly given the governance issues we have uncovered.Until Stamps.com properly addresses its settlements with the government, we view this stock as ""uninvestable.""Simply put - we think multiple government investigations that require business model modifications are clearly disclosable events. However, after this report, it will be up to Stamps.com management, its public auditing firm, and securities regulators to determine whether disclosure rules were violated. The terms of the stipulated agreement spelled out clearly that copies of the agreement needed to be provided to senior officers and Board members. So we are deeply troubled by the non-disclosure.And even if management has a reasonable explanation for why it chose not to disclose these settlements, anyone long this stock needs to start researching the competitive environment surrounding Stamps.com. What was once a relatively benign environment appears to be heating up quickly. When a business already has ~40% churn, an increase in competitive intensity could very quickly turn organic growth sharply negative. And as we have already covered - organic growth in this business is a highly dubious metric given that this management team has been out acquiring companies so aggressively and is very opaque with respect to underlying growth rates.What is abundantly clear to us is that this company - a busted legacy 90s VC-backed IPO - should not be commanding a double-digit multiple of EBITDA. As our readers have seen in our short position in BOFI, the types of revelations we have uncovered in this report are likely only scratching the surface of the problems at this company.Readers who follow the Friendly Bear know that our work rarely ends with one single report. As we continue to research Stamps.com and forensically evaluate the company, we encourage our readers and followers to do the same. We are very excited about this short position as it combines the flawed business model dynamics we identified early in TrueCar (NASDAQ:TRUE) with the disclosure problems we identified early in BOFI. Our success in those situations should give readers comfort that we have found a stock with very material downside.We also (humorously) note that all three of these companies just happen to be headquartered in Southern California. Seriously, is there something in the water down there?"

I base this assumption on the competitive landscape of mailing and courier services.Looking at the price action of STMP, it is clear that the current valuation of the stock at more than 300 times forward earnings is too expensive.","Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) has had an amazing run in the last 7 years, surging over 1,033.49%; however I am not as optimistic about the stock moving forward. To bring home the point, I will base my analysis on three area, Stamps.com's business model, its financials and price action for its stock price.Stamps.com Business ModelWhilst STMP has been consistently growing its paying customer numbers in the last eight quarters, with growth rates between 2% to 15%, I cannot see it continuing its double-digit growth year on year. I base this assumption on the competitive landscape of postage and label management services. I believe that it's operating in a very competitive landscape with low defensibility. This is obvious with services like Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) offering their own bespoke postage and label management services. There is no doubt that the world of e-commerce is growing at a phenomenal rate; however, I believe services like postage and label management are difficult to grow as a stand-alone service without either the scalable logistics fleet or additional diversified offerings.As the postage market grows, it is likely that STMP will also see increasing competition from the following categories:United States Postal Service: I believe USPS could easily offer the same services as STMP if not better.Shopping Marketplaces (eBay, Etsy, Amazon, etc.): Most of them already offer postage and label management services and could easily offer them as stand-alone services.Larger Logistics Players (FedEx (NYSE:FDX), United Parcel (NYSE:UPS)): With their network capability, they could easily scale into postage and label management services as TNT (OTCPK:TNTEY) (OTC:TNTEF) did in Europe.Small Logistics Players or New Entrants: They could easily create a software application to compete with STMP's current software.Looking back at STMP's 2013 metrics, it is clear that its paid customer numbers remained static at 485,000, showing lack of growth in an explosive industry.According to the investor presentation of March 2016, STMP plans to grow from 633,000 customers to 14,000,00. Now, that is more than a twenty-fold jump and there is no mention of a time frame or how it is going to achieve this mammoth leap in customer growth.STMP has been busy on the acquisition space, acquiring competitors like Endicia in November 2015, ShipStation in June 2014 and ShipWorks in August 2014. These acquisitions may offer some leverage to new enterprise and retail customers; however, I am not convinced that they will be the game changing moves for the business.Stamps.com FinancialsSTMP had a great 2015 with $206.7M in revenue, which is a 46% jump from the previous year. That is a great top-line achievement, but I am not convinced that it will be able to replicate this easily for the next few years due to the above mentioned reasons.In 2015, the company reported a loss of -$4.2M for the year attributed to costs associated with acquisitions.Looking at the quarterly balance sheet, the company has $65M in cash and liabilities of $137.1M. It also carries a long-term debt of $162.6M, which I assume would apportion for the financing of acquisitions.Stamps.com Price ActionLooking at the price action of STMP, it is clear that the current valuation of stock, at more than 300 times forward earnings, is too expensive. Looking at the charts, it is also evident that the price momentum is quite bearish, with the 50-day MA easily above the stock price and the 200-day MA also looking to cross above the current price.With all of the reasons mentioned above, I am quite bearish on the stock in the short to medium term. STMP is due to report on the 5th of May, and with the current declines in price, I would not be surprised to see temporary volatile moves. I am firmly on the bearish side with a price target of less than $80."

As a reward for their efforts, our campus outreach team invited the winners of these nationwide collegiate stock pitch competitions to convene in New York City for Seeking Alpha's First Annual Ultimate Competition - and the students certainly did not disappoint!  Although many more stock pitch competitions were made possible through Seeking Alpha, nine collegiate teams were represented at the first annual competition: Bentley University, Carnegie Mellon University, Columbia University, Fordham University, Georgetown University, Northeastern University, Texas A&M, University of Maryland and the University of Texas (Austin). Of course, a competition would not be complete without a group of judges, and ten top-notch investment professionals willingly volunteered their Saturday afternoon to hear and evaluate each team’s performance. The following individuals served on our panel of judges, and their advice and service must be commended: Kristina Cibor (Goldman Sachs), Ian Clark (Dichotomy Capital), Jeffrey Fischer (Seeking Alpha), Nikhil Jog (Kedar Capital), John Leonard (Seeking Alpha), Joe Mazzella (Goldman Sachs), Joe McCann (Slingshot Insights), Neil Mehta (Goldman Sachs), Johannes Salim (Quanam Capital), and Michael Taylor (Seeking Alpha).  The day consisted of a preliminary round for each school, where the students presented their broad, 30,000-foot view for one long or short idea. After each school presented, the judges used scorecards with a variety of detailed criteria in order to determine which three schools would be presenting in the final round. The top three teams were then given 25 minutes to present their 100-foot view of their long or short idea to the judges. Cash prizes were awarded to the top three winners: the first place team was awarded $3,000; second place $2,000; and third place $1,000.  Overall the event was a culmination of intricately researched stock ideas from some very talented and highly intelligent students, mixed with some invaluable analysis and advice on the part of our judges. We cannot wait to see what these students do next in the world of finance and all Seeking Alpha readers should be very excited for the articles these students will publish next.The top three teams, as well as all collegiate participants, and their stock pitches can be read below:  1st Place  Fordham University (Kevin Feeney) Loral Space & Communications (NASDAQ:LORL) - Long IdeaFordham University: Long Loral2nd Place  Texas A&M (Joshua Kim, Blake Shirk, Brandon Shirk, Tom Waldo) Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) - Short IdeaTexas A&M: Short Stamp.Com3rd Place University of Texas-Austin (Sunny Pamidimukkala, Hans Uy, Austin Partridge, Anurag Bansal) Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) - Short IdeaUniversity of Texas - Austin: Short Goodyear TireHonorable Mentions  Bentley University (Bryan Wagman) Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) - Long Idea  Carnegie Mellon University (Wilson Judy, Shaan Phagura, and Jake Gutwein) Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

(NASDAQ:STMP)Shareholders of Stamps.com were treated to an upside surprise in the financial report for the quarter ending December 2015, as both sales and earnings topped expectations. Management also delivered guidance for the year 2016 above prevailing estimates. We reiterate our Buy rating on STMP and adjust our target price to $125.00.*Non-GAAP EPS: $1.57A in FY15, $4.22E in FY16 and $4.39E in FY17Quarter highlightsThe acquired Endicia operation contributed to sales and earnings for six weeks in the quarter ending December 2015, helping drive total sales to $69.9 million. Postage volumes, paid customers and revenue per customer reached record levels as Endicia's high-volume shipping customers were added to the mix.Company DescriptionStamps.com offers online postage solutions to customers in the U.S. In addition to mailing and shipping through the U.S. Postal Service, the company offers multi-carrier shipping services through its ShipStation, ShipWorks and Endicia branded platforms. Stamps.com also provides patented PhotoStamps services that allow customers to create and buy personalized postage. Stamps.com serves a mix of individual, home office, business and large commercial customers that have significant mailing and shipping requirements.Stamps.com converted an estimated 37% of sales to free operating cash flow in FY15. Management indicated free cash flow from operations near $79 million in FY15. After using $25 million to acquire Endicia and borrowing $165 million, cash and investments totaled $75.2 million at the end of the year. Management's guidance for revenue in FY16 is in a range of $290 million to $310 million, providing between $5.00 to $5.50 in earnings per share, excluding non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and stock compensation. After updating and refining the earnings model, our estimate for sales in FY16 is revised upward to $307.1 million. We expect $4.22 in earnings per share adjusted for non-cash expenses. Our price target has been increased to $125, representing a 30.0 multiple against our revised adjusted earnings estimate of $4.22.Fourth Quarter 2015 Financial ResultsVirtually all metrics for Stamps.com pointed higher in the quarter ending December 2015. Revenue increased 67% compared to the same quarter last year to $69.9 million on increases in postage volumes, paid customers and revenue per customer. Paid customers increased to 633 in the quarter and the monthly average revenue per customer (ARPU) increased to $35.35. Postage printed increased to $1.0 million in the quarter, compared to $613,263 in the same quarter last year. We believe the dramatic increase in ARPU and total printed postage is the result of the company's continued focus on high-volume shippers. The Endicia deal, which is the most recent accomplishment in this strategic plan, brought new customers to the fold, most of which we believe can be described as commercial shippers with high-volume activity.We believe it was primarily the contribution of the recently acquired Endicia operation that boosted results in the quarter. Endicia contributed to sales and earnings in the last six weeks of the quarter after the deal closed in the third week in November 2015. Unfortunately, management declined to provide details on organic sales or on Endicia sales or profits in the quarter, citing plans to fully integrate Endicia's high volume shipping services into the fold and the intention to avoid a piecemeal approach to evaluating sales. Endicia sales were apparently incorporated into total Services, Products and Custom Postage segments.Total gross profit margin climbed to 81.1% in 4Q15. We believe economies of scale helped drive efficiencies in the sale of Products and Services. The gross profit margin in the Custom Postage segment declined in the quarter due to a mix shift to high-volume orders for custom postage that commanded lower profit margins. Postage services provided the majority of sales and highest profit margin.The reported operating loss totaled $71,000 in the quarter. The company makes much of non-GAAP operating results achieved by adjusting operating profits by non-cash expenses. This quarter, the list was lengthy and the amount material, including $8.1 million in stock-based compensation; $1.9 million income tax benefit; $1.5 million in amortization of intangible assets; $20.1 million contingent consideration charges related to the ShipStation acquisition; $500,000 for acquisition-related charges and $11,000 for capitalized debt issuance costs. Altogether, the exclusion of this laundry list of expenses left non-GAAP operating income at $29.1 million. Non-GAAP net income after these adjustments was $28.1 million or $1.57 per share.Year-End 2015 Financial ResultsFourth quarter financial performance brought total sales for FY15 to $214.0 million, representing a 46.3% increase over the previous year when sales totaled $147.3 million. Besides Endicia, the acquired operations of ShipStation and ShipWorks, with their multi-carrier solutions for shippers, contributed to the dramatic year-over-year increase, after the deals closed in last summer and early fall 2014. The company has not yet published a cash flow statement, but during the earnings conference call, management indicated free cash flow from operations totaled $79 million in the year. The implied sales-to-cash conversion rate was 37% for the year.Stamps.com balance sheet cuts a new silhouette following the close of the Endicia deal. The company borrowed $165 million to supplement its own cash for the purchase price of $215 million. Stamps.com now has $161.6 million in debt on the balance sheet at the end of December 2015. Cash resources totaled $75.2 million. Working capital declined to $10.6 million compared to $50.3 million just three months earlier.During the earnings conference call, it was announced that the board of directors had approved a $20 million stock repurchase program. At the current stock price, this represents approximately 207,800 shares or less than one day of trading volume. Neither will the share buyback compensate fully for the approximately 560,000 shares management said will be issued in the coming year related to an acquisition consideration.Updated EstimatesReported revenue in the quarter handily topped our estimate for $56.6 million and the consensus estimate for $58.0 million. Likewise, $1.57 per share in earnings adjusted for non-cash expenses was significantly higher than our estimate of $0.87 per share and the consensus estimate of $0.94 per share. The remarkable 'beat' in the quarter might inspire some to ratchet up estimates for the coming quarters. However, the discrepancy between expectations and actual results was more or less a matter of the opacity surrounding Endicia's financial performance and accounting treatments for the acquisition. Stamps.com management had disclosed few details on Stamps.com performance. Even the fourth quarter 2015 financial earnings announcement left questions unanswered. Consequently, we continue to approach estimates for Stamps.com with a conservative view in anticipation of adjusting estimates as quarterly financial reports reveal more about the potential in the combined operation.During the earnings conference call, management indicated that following the Endicia deal, the combined operation commands as much as 30% of the USPS domestic priority postage sales. Stamps.com now appears to enjoy a commanding position in the postage and shipping market. Management reiterated their plans to optimize advertising, marketing and sales for the combined brand portfolio. The integration process for Endicia has been underway for two months and the company has apparently made progress in unifying marketing activities in one unit and setting up resources and training for direct sales personnel. They continue to express confidence in the potential for synergism among the company's main brands and described the availability of multiple shipping options vital as to capture or retain customers with changing shipping needs.Concurrent with the earnings report, management outlined guidance for FY16 with sales in a range of $290 million to $310 million and earnings per share of $5.00 to $5.50 adjusted for non-cash expenses. Additional points in management's guidance:Interest cost in a range of 2% to 3%. More pronounced seasonality with strongest sales activity in the December quarter and the second strongest in the March quarter. Cash taxes near 3%. Capital investment near $5.0 million.After updating our earnings model to reflect 4Q15 financial results, we made adjustments to our sales estimates to reflect management's guidance for more pronounced seasonality. Now that Endicia's high volume business has been folded into the mix, quarterly sales results will reflect the substantially higher holiday shipping activity in the December quarter. We also adjusted assumptions related to Endicia's contribution to each of the four segments reported by Stamps.com. Otherwise, we left our assumption of 15% year-over-year organic sales growth in place, which reveals our confidence that the company can capture market share during the year. Of course, the primary growth in the year will come from the addition of Endicia sales to the mix. The changes lead to an increase in our sales estimate for FY16 to $307.1 million (from $289.8 million).Our cost of goods and operating expense assumptions were refined to reflect recent cost and spending patterns. The overall gross margin is now 79.4% (from 79.8%). We also have some concern that management plans to 'optimize and enhance' sales and marketing as well as 'enhance' the company's solutions for high-volume shippers. Management made no mention of an increased operating budget and mentioned efficiencies that could accrue to the combined operations. However, we have some concern that supporting multiple brands and a wide array of customer types from small businesses to large volume shippers could present challenges for sales and marketing strategies. Accordingly, we cross-checked our operating expense assumptions to confirm an adequate increase in budget to support the company's plans for sales, marketing and research and development. Our total operating expense estimate increased to $175.0 million (from $173 million).The combined result of these minor but numerous changes is an estimate of GAAP earnings per share of $2.56 per share (from $2.11 per share) in FY16. On a non-GAAP basis, after adjusting earnings for non-cash expenses, our estimate for FY16 is $4.22 per share (from $3.84 per share).OutlookManagement's guidance for FY16 was well above the estimates we had in place for adjusted earnings per share of $3.84 on sales of $289.8 million and the prevailing consensus estimate for $4.34 per share adjusted earnings on $278.1 million in total sales. Following news of the upside surprise in the fourth quarter results, the generous guidance sent the stock soaring in after-hours trading.Prior to the earnings announcement, the stock had been trading at 22.2 times the prevailing consensus estimate of $4.34 in adjusted earnings per share in FY16. Against the top end of management's guidance range for adjusted earnings of $5.50, this metric implies a price of $122.00 per share. However, traders had been more generous just two months ago, before worries about China growth rates and crude oil prices wore down confidence. In December 2015, as the stock established a new 52-week high near the $112 price level, the stock was valued at 26.0 times the consensus estimate for FY16 adjusted earnings. That multiple suggests the stock could trade to the $143 price level if traders could regain their earlier enthusiasm for Stamps.com.The recently announced stock repurchase program could have a lubricating effect on valuation as well as share price. The announcement alone could attract traders who follow stock repurchase announcements in anticipation of stock price appreciation that has historically followed buybacks. That said, at the current price level and trading volume pattern, the $20 million budget barely covers one day of typically trading activity. Consequently, we do not expect a measurable impact on price by the stock buyback announcement.We continue to use the discounted cash flow method to value STMP. The analysis results in a value of $127.00 at year-end 2016. This target price implies a multiple of 30.0 times against our estimate of $4.22 for FY16 earnings adjusted for non-cash expenses, including depreciation, amortization and stock compensation.The comparable valuation approach provides a possible validation of the results of our discounted cash flow method. Again, we used a group of 203 stocks for companies in the application software sector. Three months ago, the group was trading near 102.3 times free cash flow from operations. However, despite an uptick in volatility in the broader U.S. equity market, the multiple remains near 100 times. Stamps.com could also be compared to a group of 210 companies in the business software and services segment, which is now trading at 50.4 times free cash flow from operations, up from 47.0 times three month ago. While the increase might be surprising given the U.S. equity market sell-off that has been observed over the last few months, the apparent resilience of these two groups is corroborated by the forward earnings multiples of application and business systems software subgroups in the S&P 500 Index, both of which have been on a steady drive higher for the last five years. Only the price/earnings multiple for the application software group has experienced a sharp drop downward over the past two months, nonetheless, remaining over 30 times forward earnings.The comparable approach implies a value near $200 per share after we applied adjustments to the free cash flow from operations multiples in the groups described in the previous paragraph. Note that we adjusted the comparable group multiples downward by 30% to recognize Stamps.com size and profitability relative to the two groups.While we anticipate a sharp drive higher in the STMP price, we have some concerns about the potential to achieve the price levels suggested by comparables exercise. Volatility is at elevated levels in the current U.S. equity market and the small-capitalization company sector has recently been under pressure from a rotation to larger capitalization companies with perceived higher quality earnings and therefore lower risk. Accordingly, we have set our price target at $125.00 per share, representing a 30% upside potential from the current price level.Our price target also corresponds the recent 52-week high price level for STMP. We believe the recent trading patterns in the stock provide support that our price target is achievable. Financial results for the first quarter ending March 2016, should provide a strong catalyst for the stock as we expect the quarter results to validate and confirm the strong results of the quarter just reported."
3961679,23727,2016-03-29T11:17:35-04:00,High P/S ratio.Lower operating cash flows.Insiders still selling.,"A ""Stamp"" that you don't want to collect, into your portfolio, is Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP)Source: worden.com""Why?"" you ask, ""It's in a bull market!""Indeed, it has been. Currently, STMP is seen as a ""growth"" stock. However, one must think about what it sells.Simply, it sells stamps, or postage, over the internet that one can then print instead of running down to the post office.Source: I-metrixThe sales growth looks impressive. But, and here is the inevitable ""but"", it has not come from organic growth, instead STMP has simply bought other companies.STMP gave the following ""pro forma"" tables on page F-19 of its 2015 annual report.Here is a portion of the press release for the ""Endicia"" acquisition:That is a Price/Sales (P/S) ratio of $215/$59 = 3.644Also, notice that in 2014, after the ""ShipStation"" and ""ShipWorks"" acquisitions, that pro forma revenue was $154,459. Then after the ""Endicia"" acquisition the pro forma revenue was $204,628. However, the press release reported Endicia having revenues of about $59 million, or $59,000, expressed in thousands, in 2014.Now $154,459 + $59,000 = $213,459 (in thousands)But, STMP's pro forma revenue number, given in their annual report is $204,628. That is $8,831 less than what one would expect. Hmm...Were the other parts of STMP having slowing sales?Remember, STMP paid 3.644 P/S for the Endicia acquisition. Look at the Price/Sales and Price/Book of STMP.Source: I-metrixCurrently, STMP has a Price/Book ratio of 7.54 and a Price/Sales ratio of 8.42. Dr. Damodaran shows an average P/S of 3.46 for retailers (online). STMP bulls might argue that the company should have a software application P/S multiple of 4.90. I do not find this argument compelling, since the company sells stamps online. Also, it just made a major acquisition of a competitor with a P/S ratio of 3.644, which is much closer to the industry average of 3.46. Using the pro forma revenue numbers $59,000/$204,628 = 28.8% of STMP's sales.The company itself even identifies itself as an internet retailer in a press release:Either Newell Rubbermaid's investment bankers made a gross mistake in their valuation of Endicia or the ""market"" is making a gross mistake currently.Also helping me think that the ""market"" is making a mistake, comes from looking at STMP's operating cash flows.Source: I-metrixSTMP has been saying don't look at their negative GAAP earnings but their pro forma earnings, which exclude one-time adjustments. However, operating cash flows also do not worry about non-cash one-time charges and despite the revenue growth, there was no ""growth"" in operating cash flows in 2015. There should be operating cash flow growth in a healthy company.Also, look at the quarterly cash flow in 2015 compared to 2014. Only one quarter had Y-o-Y growth, Q2 2015. The acquisition of Endicia was completed in November of 2015, which also showed declining operating cash flow from the previous year, when ""ShipWorks"" and ""ShipStation"" were acquired.Source: I-metrix & Author's calculationsOne can also look at STMP's competitor Pitney Bowels (NYSE:PBI), which sports a Price/Sales ratio of 1.12.Investment bankers, and activist hedge funds, maybe you should go tell Pitney Bowels to spin off its division that most resembles STMP and receive the higher P/S multiple to ""unlock"" shareholder value.I also found a European firm, Neopost S.A. (OTCPK:NPACY), which shows a Price/Sales ratio of 0.62. The liquidity for this firm looks very poor, for its US listed ADRs, but maybe European readers could find it useful and liquid in its home market.In the end, I believe a compelling case can be made that STMP should have a much lower Price/Sales multiple, based upon the average multiple of online retailers, with the company itself identifying as an internet retailer, the Price/Sales multiple of the most recent acquisition, and the lower Price/Sales multiple of competitors.Source: worden.comCurrently, STMP is trading up with each earnings release as traders ""believe"" the pro forma numbers. However, operating cash flows are showing a different story. This is a dangerous stock to short currently, because Wall Street is still in love with the ""growth"" story, but insiders are not holding onto their stock for the long term.Source: I-metrixIf long, consider hedging with options. Also, consider tilting towards competitors with better value and cash flow metrics if your investment mandate includes this industry. High risk, speculators put this on a watch list to short eventually. When the market figures out that the growth is from bolting on other competitors, and the pro forma numbers begin to get disregarded, look for that 8.42 Price/Sales ratio to mean revert back towards 3.5.It will get ugly when this ""growth"" story ends.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3956197,56112,2016-03-07T16:00:00-05:00,"Stamps.com seems to have created a lot of value through its acquisition strategy.In the near term, the stock looks too hot, trading at 35x fully-taxed earnings despite an organic growth rate likely in the low-double digits.While the company has a leading competitive position today relative to Pitney Bowes, I do think there is significant disintermediation risk over the medium-to-long term.","Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) toiled in relative obscurity for a fairly long time. As recently as 2011, this was a business with a market cap under $200 million. It's still underfollowed, but no longer undervalued - with eCommerce parcel volume making shipping labels sexy again, and a series of value-creating acquisitions by management solidifying the company's competitive position here (for now), shareholders have made out well.They may have made out a little too well, in fact - while reported earnings and revenue growth look great, when you dig into things a little bit, organic growth and tax-affected earnings don't seem to justify the valuation here. Throw in potential long-term competitive threats from evolving eCommerce dynamics and a potential breakdown of the artificially imposed barrier to entry, and I have trouble seeing these shares as good value here today.Results Good, But MuddyStamps' rapid-fire acquisition of ShipStation, ShipWorks, and now Endicia - with no clarity provided on exact financials - makes the underlying organic results for legacy Stamps.com (as well as the acquired businesses) pretty difficult to determine. For 2016, revenue is expected to be $300 million at the midpoint, versus $214 million in 2015. As best as I can tell from rooting around, north of $50 million of this should be inorganic addition of Endicia (which was only included for about 6 weeks in 2015). This would point to a true organic growth rate under 17%. I believe the real number is likely to be in the low-double digits, based both on industry data and estimates of Endicia's revenue, which would put the inorganic contribution closer to $60 million than $50. (Caveat: I could be doing the math wrong, so take my numbers with a grain of salt.)The headline number, of course, is the $5-5.50 non-GAAP EPS guidance, up from $4.43 in 2015 and $2.47 in 2014. While the stock may at first look reasonable or even cheap on these numbers given the growth rate, keep in mind that the significant NOL is sheltering earnings from taxes and will likely be fully utilized by 2017. Fully taxed earnings (based on management's guidance of 3% implied in their number, and an assumed high 30s to 40% rate otherwise) would instead be somewhere around $3.25 at the midpoint, making the stock look significantly more expensive. Yes, this is a capital-light business with double-digit growth potential, but 35x fully taxed earnings still seems steep.All eCommerce Growth Is Not IdenticalSpeaking of that growth potential, the generally accepted number is that eCommerce will grow at 10-15%/year, likely towards the higher end. Neither I nor anyone else would really raise much of an objection to this directionally - you can perhaps argue that it will be closer to 12%, or 17%, or whatever number you want, but there seems to be a pretty strong secular rationale for more and more commerce to move online.What's less obvious is that the eCommerce market is non-homogeneous, i.e., you can't just slap that 15% growth rate on every given company in every given segment and assume that's the way it's going to be. It's obvious, for example, that categories with substantially lower e-commerce penetration will grow faster than, say, a category like music, where the penetration rate is already quite high.It gets even more nuanced, though: when analyzing ""plumbing"" providers like Stamps.com or ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM), you have to consider who they're selling to. The e-commerce market is at once fragmented and concentrated - there are a few 800-pound gorillas and a whole lot of featherweights. As I've discussed previously, a number of sources, from ChannelAdvisor to eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), suggest that at the moment, the growth is concentrated in a few places, and everyone else is flattish. In other words, the big fish are eating all the food, leaving none for the little guys.This is a challenge for many companies, because the bigger the client, the more bargaining power they have - ChannelAdvisor's take rate decreases as the size of its customer increases, and I believe the same may prove to be the case for what Stamps.com is able to charge on a per-user basis. This could be a double headwind - if the winner-takes-all trend turns out to be something more permanent than a blip, it could pressure Stamps.com. This doesn't appear to have shown up in its results yet, but as I discussed, management's reticence to provide color around the financials of the acquired companies makes it challenging to track the progress of the business on an organic basis. Stamps/Endicia combined appear to have somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% share in what Stamps.com used to refer to as ""PC Postage,"" with Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI) having the other 10% of the market.Disintermediation Still A WorryI will probably get lambasted by bulls for bringing this up, because the company has been around for nearly two decades now, and Pitney somehow still manages to sell meters to SMBs despite the existence of Stamps.com. Moreover, the move by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) a few years ago to make its internal mailing permit system available to sellers didn't slow down the growth.Yet, threats seem to be present. The company disclosed in its 10-K that ""Etsy informed us that they would be switching their postage solution from Endicia to the USPS's ePostage branded solution in February 2016, and as a result Endicia will experience a loss of postage volume and revenue."" This is not, on its own, all that material, but I view it as a potentially worrisome indicator. (eBay/PayPal offer free printing of shipping labels, like Amazon.)Here's my question: despite STMP's patent portfolio and somewhat significant R&D spend, it just doesn't seem like most of what the company does is all that complicated. Multi-carrier integration sounds like a big deal, but when you think about the fact that you're only dealing with three shippers - the USPS, FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and UPS (NYSE:UPS) - suddenly it doesn't seem so daunting of a task. It's also telling, to me, that the company has historically highlighted regulatory approval and its IP portfolio (rather than the strength of its technology and value proposition) as the primary barriers to entry for competitors.Saying that it will stay this way because it's been this way seems dangerous. Having reviewed various forum discussions by SMB internet sellers regarding postage over the past few years, it seems like most have tried multiple solutions and are willing to jump ship at the first sign of a lower price (notwithstanding that the monthly fees really aren't all that high). In that context, I actually find it concerning that Stamps' EBITDA margins seem absurdly high relative to a variety of software companies that seem to do far more complicated things. Is this sustainable over the long term? At least one industry expert seems to think that the Postal Service could approve one or more competitors to the two remaining PC Postage vendors; others in the industry (as well as SMB Internet sellers) seem like they would be thrilled for this to become reality, and there are very fat margins to go after here.Regardless, I'm not optimistic about the company having any pricing power, particularly if its customers get bigger. I would also point out that despite the revenue being ""recurring,"" it's not very sticky - I believe switching costs for customers would be pretty low.Wrapping It UpManagement should be commended for their series of (so far) value-creating acquisitions, and I'm very curious to see how this plays out (as both a business and a stock) over the next three to five years. Having spent a lot of time researching Pitney Bowes as well, it's clear that Stamps.com is by far the superior player. That said, the stock seems to have gotten a little hot unless you believe that teens organic growth is possible over the medium to long term, and I think shareholders who've benefited from the massive run-up would do well to consider trimming back their positions a bit.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

3690536,92936,2015-11-17T01:10:20-05:00,"Stamps.com's financial performance in the third quarter ending September 2015 exceeded our and consensus expectations.Management revised guidance higher for the year 2015 to a range of $198-208 million in total sales, providing non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.60-4.00.We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock and adjust our price target upward to $116.00 per share.","Operations Performance In Third QuarterStamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) surprised to the upside with sales and earnings performance in the third quarter ending September 2015. Reported sales beat our and consensus estimates by 7.7% and 5.7%, respectively. Likewise, non-GAAP earnings exceed expectations by over 30%, as the company benefited from operating leverage despite experiencing higher direct costs. The specter of better-than-expected growth and profitability was as compelling for the STMP bull case as management's confirmation of the closing of its pending acquisition of Endicia, one of its largest competitors.We believe third-quarter results reflect the realization of strategic advantages related to ShipWorks and ShipStation, two package shipping platforms acquired by Stamps.com in 2014. The deals expanded the company's presence in package shipping, which is growing at a faster pace than the postage segment. We also believe that Stamps.com has gained market share by virtue of a larger presence and higher profile in the package shipping market, which was gained vis-à-vis the acquisitions last year. We also note that among the numerous data points provided by Stamps.com at the end of each quarter, there was evidence that the company is achieving efficiencies in winning and serving customers as well as in customer satisfaction. Paid customer cancellation rates declined in the quarter, and costs per small business customers declined.In our view, third-quarter performance underscores the viability of the Stamps.com business model and competitive position. It also supports the view that the management team has the ability to execute effectively against its strategic growth plan.Third-Quarter SummaryRevised Earnings ModelOur earnings model has been updated to reflect reported sales, costs and expenses in the third quarter ending September 2015. We also revised the model to reflect the contribution from Endicia beginning on November 19, 2015. The changes in our model were also informed by management's revised guidance for FY '15, as well as our assumptions related to the Endicia transaction.For the second time this year, management raised guidance for FY '15 to a range of $198-208 million (from $170-190 million), providing non-GAAP net income in a range of $3.60-4.00 per share (from a range of $3.10-3.50 per share). The company adjusts net income for certain non-cash expenses, including depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock compensation and other one-time charges that have been recorded in one period or another. The increase in the guided sales range was driven by: 1) better-than-expected performance in the September quarter; 2) contribution from Endicia from the date of closing of the transaction on November 19, 2015 to the end of the year; and 3) increased confidence in Stamps.com's existing operations.Following are the assumptions related to the Endicia transaction and financial performance:We caution investors that our assumptions related to Endicia's balance sheet are approximations only and represent only one scenario for the transaction. The assumptions were used to determine the potential intangible asset value that could be required in applying purchase accounting principles as well as amortization of the intangible asset in subsequent periods. Newell Rubbermaid had previously disclosed $44.9 million in total assets related to Endicia, which is expected to be adjusted in value by Stamps.com for the purposes of determining the excess in purchase price over net tangible asset value. Since our assumption of $61 million is higher, the scenario that we have displayed in our model may reflect lower intangible assets and amortization than might eventually be reported.The company is expected to disclose audited financial statements for Endicia in the coming weeks. Management has indicated that the audit will not begin until after the transaction is closed, suggesting the audited financial report may not be available until after the end of December. In the meantime, our model provides a preliminary profile for Endicia.Quarter Ending December and Fiscal Year 2015The combined impact of our changes and assumptions results in a revised sales estimate of $56.6 million (from $50.1 million), bringing total sales to $200.7 million in FY '15 (from $191.4 million). The increase in sales is a combination of $2.8 million in sales reported in the quarter ending September 2015 that we had not anticipated and $6.5 million in new sales contribution from Endicia. We believe we had already captured the momentum developing at Stamps.com's top line, and made no increase in our estimate of sales for the company's existing operations. Our sales estimate for FY '15 is well within management's guidance, albeit nearer the lower end of the range than the higher end.Our assumptions for costs and expenses included two important additions beginning in the quarter ending December 2015. First, there is an incremental expense of $500,000 for amortization of the intangible assets related to Endicia. Second, we have included interest expense on the new term loan and revolving line of credit based on an assumed interest rate of 2.0% per year. Furthermore, to reflect the addition of Endicia operations as well as recent spending patterns in the Stamps.com operations, we made adjustments to the operating expense rates for marketing, research, development, general and administrative activities. Combined, these changes result in a revised GAAP net income estimate of $6.7 million, or $0.40 per share (from $5.6 million, or $0.33 per share), and a revised non-GAAP net income of $14.7 million, or $0.87 per share (from $12.3 million, or $0.73 per share) in the quarter ending December 2015.The revised sales, cost and spending assumptions for the fourth quarter bring our estimates for FY '15 net income on a GAAP basis to $2.5 million, or $0.15 per share (from a net loss of $282,000, or $0.02 per share), and on a non-GAAP basis to $62.2 million, or $3.75 per share (from $52.0 million, or $3.14 per share). As with the sales estimate, our earnings estimate is in sync with management's guidance, and falls nearer the low end of the range provided for non-GAAP earnings.Fiscal Year 2016The view on FY '16 may be more interesting for investors. We added an incremental $59 million in sales related to Endicia in our estimate in the Products and Services categories, bringing our estimate of total sales to $289.8 million (from $220.1 million). We believe this is a conservative view on the potential in the acquired company, as it assumes little growth has been occurring at Endicia since 2014. Strategic benefits from combining Endicia with Stamps.com's operations are also not included. We expect the combination to eventually lead to augmented sales from an improved competitive position and access to new customers for cross-sales efforts. Management has indicated in our conversations that they also expect to gain new customers who are more willing to do business with a larger organization that offers more robust systems and available support personnel.Our model now reflects interest expense for FY '16 totaling $2.1 million and amortization expenses totaling $13.2 million. Assumptions for other costs and expenses in the year largely reflect recent rates in the Endicia operation. We expect both cost and operating expenses rates to change over time as management begins integrating the Endicia operation into the larger picture. Our cost of sales assumption is 20.8% for the year, compared to 21.1% in FY '15 and 22.3% in FY '14. Likewise, the operating spending rate has increased by 220 basis points to 60.0% of sales in FY '16, compared to 57.8% in FY '15, but is lower than FY '14's operating expenses of 61.5% of total sales. In our view, our model is conservative, given that customer metrics have been improving. As shown in Chart 2 (Customer Metrics) above, customer cancellation rates and the ratio of enhanced promotion spending to revenue are both trending down on a seasonal basis.The revised GAAP net income estimate for FY '16 is $36.0 million, or $2.11 per share, and on a non-GAAP basis $65.6 million, or $3.84 per share. We note that our FY '16 results to do reflect additional charges related to the contingent consideration for prior acquisitions. The year-over-year comparison is aided by estimated cash flow from operations, which we estimate could be $97.2 million in FY '16. This compares to our estimate of $53.1 million in operation cash flow in FY '15 and $51.7 million in FY '14.During the earnings conference call, management had indicated economies of scale are expected in customer service, and they expect to save by eliminating duplicative elements in back-end operations such as data center capacity. Management has indicated in our conversations that achievement of savings will take place over time as the integration process unfolds, and that Stamps.com management intends to make measured changes in the Endicia operations. Thus far, it appears management does not have an exact timetable to bring about changes in operations. The team has had limited access to Endicia's personnel and financial reports, and will needed time for additional study of operational overlaps. Nonetheless, if achieved, these effects could represent upside to our estimates.ValuationConfirmation that the Endicia transaction would close, coupled with an upside surprise in the third quarter from existing operations sent STMP shares skyrocketing in after-market trading directly following the appearance of the company's press release. The stock closed last week well above our previous target of $93.00. STMP may be slightly ahead of itself at the current price level, and may retrace lower levels to fill in the wide gap created in the first trading session following the earnings and acquisition announcement.We also note that there is potential for uneven performance in the quarters ahead relative to expectations. Investors are building expectations for financial performance based on limited information relative to Endicia even before Stamps.com's management has begun integrating the operation into the fold. The company will begin to update consolidated performance metrics for the combination, which may not meet early expectations. The stock price now appears to have built in considerable investor amity that could be pared away in the event of disappointing results. Consequently, we urge investors to accumulate shares with care and take advantage of periods of price weakness to build positions in STMP. Indeed, some investors may prefer to take profits in the short term and rebuild long positions if the stock revisits lower price levels.In our view, third-quarter performance demonstrates the competitive strength of the Stamps.com franchise and supports the view that the company can deliver earnings growth through a combination of organic and acquired growth. We used financial results from FY '16 to value Stamps.com, since it is more appropriate to view the company with its new configuration now that it is clear the Endicia deal will be brought to a successful conclusion.We have updated our valuation of STMP again, using the discounted cash flow method. The analysis, which is displayed on the final page of this report, results in a value of $115.99 at year-end 2016. Accordingly, we have reset our price target to $116.00. Our target price implies a multiple of 30.2 times non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.84 in FY '16, which excludes non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization and stock compensation.To validate the results of our discounted cash flow method, we also considered a group of 190 stocks for companies in the application software sector. The group is currently trading at 102.5 times cash earnings. Notably, the group has experienced depressed net profit margins, which averaged 10.8% in the last twelve months. Stamps.com could also be compared to a group of 200 companies in the business software and services segment, which is trading at 46.7 times trailing non-GAAP earnings that exclude non-cash expenses. Net profit margin of 13.8% in the business software and services group compares favorably to the application software group. While Stamps.com is more profitable than either group, it is considerably smaller in terms of revenue than the average of either group. Nonetheless, in our view, the comparison to current price multiples of companies with similar business models and target customers provides validation of our valuation results using the discounted cash flow method."
3512346,70315,2015-09-15T16:32:37-04:00,"Stamps.com sports respectable fundamentals, growing its revenue and free cash flow at a decent clip.Stamps.com possesses plenty of cash with no long-term debt and only small amounts of overall debt.Technological disruption could prove detrimental to Stamps.com and its shareholders over the long-term.","It's important for long-term investors to develop a guide for doing their investment research. Over the years I have developed questions to guide me in my thinking when researching the publicly traded universe. This format represents a good starting point before completing more in-depth research. Right now let's talk about Stamps.com (NASDAQ: STMP).1.) What does the company do?When you buy shares in a company you effectively become part owner of that company. Therefore, it's important for an investor to understand what a company sells. Stamps.com provides postage solutions to businesses small and large. Postage plays an important role in an age where consumers increasingly shop online. The company also sells packing and postage supplies. Moreover, Stamps.com sells novelty photo stamps, which represent a less significant part of its business.2.) What do the fundamentals look like?Investors should also look for companies that grow revenue and free cash flow over the long-term, retaining some of that cash for reinvestment back into the business and for economic hard times. Excellent revenue and free cash flow growth serve as catalysts for superior long-term gains. Over the past five years Stamps.com increased its revenue and free cash flow by a respectable 104% and 326%, respectively. However, its net income declined 13% during that time (see chart below).Revenue and free cash flow expanded largely due to the organic growth in customers and partnerships with the exception of 2014 and 2015 where organic growth along with acquisitions affected fundamentals. Charges pertaining to Stamps.com's acquisitions and an uptick in operating expenses in 2014 and 2015 contributed to the negative net income comparisons.Stamps.com also made acquisitions in FY 2015, which contributed to year-to-date revenue expansion of 37% year-over-year. Stamps.com clocked in a year-to-date net loss of $11.4 million due to contingent consideration charges and litigation settlements. Stamps.com's year-to-date free cash flow declined 2% year-over-year due to unfavorable impact from accounts receivables.Stamps.com sports an excellent balance sheet, which is refreshing compared to most companies I research. In the most recent quarter, the company possessed $84.1 million in cash and investments, which equated to 39% of stockholder's equity. I like to see companies possess cash amounting to 20% or more of stockholder's equity to get them through tough times and to self-finance operations without the help of outside financing. Moreover, the company possesses no long-term debt. I like to see companies with long-term debt amounting to 50% or less of stockholder's equity. In fact, Stamps.com's total debt, comprised of short-term debt and long-term accruals, amounts to only 38% of stockholder's equity.The stock market has rewarded the shareholders of Stamps.com with a total return of 659% over the past five years vs. 96% for the S&P 500 (see chart below).3.) How much management-employee ownership is there?Investors should always look for businesses where the managers and/or employees own a lot of stock in the company. Managers with a great deal of stock in the company will take better care to maximize company profits, which will enhance share price and their personal wealth along with the wealth of shareholders. Directors Mohan Ananda (also a Founder) and Lloyd Miller own 4.5% and 5%, respectively, of the company, which means they possess some extra incentive to see the company succeed.4.) How does its ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"" stack up?Every year a company employs external auditors to audit financial statements and evaluate whether it maintains adequate financial controls. At the conclusion of the audit, you want to see a letter from auditors with the language ""unqualified"" or ""fairly presents"", which generally means that the financial statements and internal systems in constructing them were clean or adequate. If you see ""qualified"" or ""adverse"" in the auditing letter's language then deeper issues in a company's financial statements may exist. Last year, Stamps.com's auditors gave its financial statements a ""presents fairly"" opinion and said that it maintained adequate internal controls.5.) What types of risk does it have?It's always important for investors to weigh the various risks such as exposure to political risk in parts of the world where war is the norm, competitive positioning, and market price risk. Stamps.com operates in the United States, which means that political risk is minimal.Stamps.com is a technology company, which means another company with better technology can come in and supplant it. In fact, online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) created its own postage system in 2012, which negatively impacted Stamps.com's business. There is nothing keeping other online businesses from developing their own technologies that will compete with Stamps.com.Stamps.com's stock price currently trades at 186 times its suppressed earnings, according to Morningstar, due to the extraordinary items listed above. However, the company trades at a price to free cash flow ratio of 25 vs. 11 for the S&P 500. In comparison, this company's market price risk resides in the high range.6.) What does its forward analysis look like?Stamps.com expanded its fundamentals at a decent rate over the past five years, and it possesses an excellent balance sheet. Technology investors who can stomach the risk of obsolescence may want to seriously consider this company. However, I am going to take my investing dollars elsewhere as companies with greater resources can develop technologies that can effectively compete with this company."

        A look at what Stamps.com is worth now.
        A competitor that has better value metrics.","It's only been 10 months, but it looks like my decision to not buy Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) has been a mistake so far.Here's how Stamps.com reacted after I wrote my last article showing that it was fairly valued.But first, let me get the cliche out that the market should be viewed long term and over the short term, anything can happen.However, a 10-30% move within a year can be viewed as just market movement, but 118%?There has to be something I missed right?Here's the link to the previous article on Stamps.com that details all the numbers. I'll be going over some of these numbers and thoughts from back then to see whether there are obvious mistakes with the benefit of hindsight and see if I can do a better job this time.Here's what I started out with.The difference now is that with the recent acquisition of Endica, the company will have debt showing on its balance sheet in the next quarterly report.However, the acquisition is excellent and it only strengthens its position in the postage labeling business.Ecommerce is thriving, more and more sellers are getting on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to sell their products.In fact, there has been a huge explosion in past few years as more and more people get on the retail arbitrage bandwagon or sourcing products from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and then selling it on Amazon.Just check for yourself the number of ebooks published on retail arbitrage and DIY selling on Amazon. It's a multi billion dollar industry.The business model is still great and the risk of USPS continually going downhill still exists which is why the acquisition of Endicia is a great move.It shows that management is aware of what's happening and what their risks are.The downside is that the acquisition looks expensive at about 3x.The SAAS model of Stamps.com is scalable and generates a ton of FCF.Their acquisition of ShipStation before Endicia has certainly helped as FCF in the TTM is $48.5m.So Where Did I Go Wrong?Looking back at my notes, it looks like I underestimated managements ability to make good decisions.I was too afraid of the USPS risk and how it could affect business.I underestimated the growth estimates in the valuation.Although the price has proven me wrong so far, the valuation is far too rich at this point.Here's why.Updated ValuationsHere is a look at the 5 year median values with the OSV Stock Analyzer to give you a better idea of what range I'm talking about.Compare these numbers to its competitor Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI).Side by side, the current valuation for STMP looks ridiculous.Smart acquisition but it looks like the market is pricing in perfection.Here's a better look side by side.Stamps.com wins when it comes to growth, but in terms of valuation and lower expectations, Pitney Bowes wins.Priced for Perfection?With the stock at $70 and utilizing a reverse DCF technique to see what the market is expecting from the stock, the expected growth rate using the TTM FCF of $48.5m is 14.5%.Check out the inputs and the values in the screenshot below.Analyst estimates are 13.6% for next year which is close to the expected 14.5% that I've calculated.Long term 5 year growth rates are estimated at 20%.14.5% growth is achievable but when you combine an EV/EBIT multiple of 75, it doesn't inspire confidence.Here's a PDF report of the data I'm using that you can download to double check the data.Summing UpI've certainly missed out on a 100% flyer, but I won't be chasing STMP.So far, it has proven me wrong with the stock price, but in terms of valuation, it's priced to fall quickly with any small misstep.There are mistakes I've made when going through the risks and business model, but the valuation is far too rich and not worth the risk of losing money."
2435025,21848,2014-08-19T09:34:19-04:00,,"Fast-growing small company - check.Huge margins - check.Cash machine - check.No debt and healthy balance sheet - check.Interested yet?I'll take you through how I analyzed this company and what my conclusion is.The Retail Shipping IndustryI recently announced that my wife started her own ecommerce business, and one of the big hurdles with any online store is shipping.This isn't the first time my wife and I tried an ecommerce store.When we first started and an order came in, my wife would box things up and make a trip to the local USPS, stand in line and mail it out.As you know, online orders don't come in at the same time.Being new to the whole online business thing and just happy to be getting some orders, my wife would make a trip maybe 2 or more times a day.And if you've been to the USPS, you know how frustrating things can get when lines are long and people are slow.So this was a huge waste of time. It'd literally take 30 minutes to ship out a package.Funnily enough, this is very common.With more people making a living off eBay and the Amazon marketplace nowadays, expect the number of packages being shipped to increase.The Middleman - Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP)This is where a middleman service like stamps.com comes into play.Instead of having to wait in line to buy the postage and ship the box, Stamps.com allows you to pay for the postage online.You then print out the shipping label, stick it on your box and simply drop off your package at the nearest location.If you have enough volume, you can arrange USPS to come by daily to pick up your boxes.You get all this by paying a small monthly fee to Stamps.com.CompetitionStamps.com is one of three vendors licensed by the USPS to sell postage. You won't get more USPS reseller competitors, so the obvious competition is really UPS and FedEx.UPS and FedEx are able to adapt to changes in the environment, whereas USPS has to go through Congress to make changes.Both UPS and FedEx welcome new business accounts, and it's also very easy for business owners to go online to pay and print out labels. Once you start gaining some volume with either UPS or FedEx, they will negotiate some good rates for you.It's a win-win.On the other hand, there's no such thing with USPS. You pay what they charge, and it's not a scalable solution limited to smaller businesses.Cash Cow Subscription ModelStamps.com operates a SAAS (Software-as-a-Service) subscription model, which means that people pay monthly or yearly for the service.If the service is valuable and helps people save time and energy, it's a no-brainer for people to continue subscribing. By offering a product that helps you respect and maximize your time, it becomes a very sticky business for consumers.Once a business model like Stamps.com gains traction and hits a certain number of customers to break-even, it's a huge cash cow from there.Having been in business since the dot com era, Stamps.com is well-established.Just look at the FCF growth that Stamps.com has witnessed.There is some serious fluctuation (there's a reason), but you can't deny that this small company is a cash cow, while trying to grow at the same time.FCF and Owner Earnings in MillionsFCF and growth have fluctuated wildly over the years, but 2013 looks to be a breakout year, with TTM numbers looking good also.FCF is simplyFCF = Cash from Operations - CapexOwner Earnings I'm using is;Owner Earnings = Reported Earnings (also known as Net Income)+ Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization+ Other Non Cash Charges- Capital Expenditures (if you can, use maintenance capex)- Increase / (Decrease) in Working CapitalUsing FCF to Perform a Quick Initial Valuation FilterWhen I first load STMP into my stock analyzer, I'm greeted with this raw intrinsic value chart based on DCF.STMP DCF Price to Intrinsic ValueWhenever I see a chart like this, where the intrinsic value is much higher than the stock price, I immediately know that the company;a) makes a ton of cash (explained above)b) has a high growth rateChecking in on STMP, I'm greeted with both a) and b).However the expected growth rate of 27% that I'm getting is too high for a company that hasn't proven itself. Not worthy of such a high growth rate at the moment.Over a 5-year and 10-year period, the growth rates aren't very impressive.5-yr. and 10-yr. FCF Growth RatesThis only comes out to 8.8% over multiple rolling periods in the last 5 years.It's 6.2% when you take multiple periods throughout the past 10 years.These two numbers are indicative of how cash growth has been volatile, despite making so much money.Now if I adjust the growth rate down to next year's expected rate of 12%, the chart becomes much more reasonable.Intrinsic Chart UpdatedSo there's some hope.But...NOLs Good or Bad?One of the things that worry me about Stamps.com and the true health of the FCF is its NOL and tax credits.It's viewed as an asset when a business holds a large NOL balance with a distant expiration date.But in Stamps.com case, the NOLs are already expiring.If the NOL was set to expire in 2020 like the federal NOLs, then this could be viewed as an asset.However, in a few years, the NOLs will all be gone and Stamps.com will likely pay taxes in the 33% range.That's obviously going to affect the bottom line and drag down performance.ShipStation Acquisition and the New DirectionAt this moment in time, Stamps.com isn't a bad stock.In fact, there are some things going for it.Its recent acquisition of ShipStation.com for $50m in cash was great.ShipStation is an online shipping software solution to help manage online orders. It lets users connect to Stamps.com, UPS, FedEx and other carriers.It also supports Amazon Fulfillment, so that ecommerce sellers can use Amazon's fulfillment service.Not only that, it is the #1 shipping and order management solution for ecommerce stores. Mostly all big ecommerce systems connect directly to ShipStation, which is a huge benefit.My wife uses ShipStation, and it's a life saver. It streamlines and improves the efficiency of shipping packages with other stats to help you see how your business is doing.It's finally a step forward for Stamps.com to diversify revenue away from USPS.I bring this up because...The USPS Risk is RealI'm sure you're aware of the financial struggles that USPS is facing. It's weird how USPS is government-owned, yet it doesn't get the funding. It has to act like a privatized government entity, which is an immediate disadvantage.No immediate funding, a big pension liability it has to fulfill, slow and cumbersome organization.What's worse, USPS will continue to lose out on competition, because it can't make changes on its own. Important changes have to go through Congress, which is a waste of time.With this additional context, let's move on to the valuation to see what comes up.Valuation TodayThe expiring NOLs make things slightly more complicated, and the following two points make DCF a problem.It's easier and cleaner to applyEBIT ValuationTo get the full explanation of how this works, view this article that takes you through the EBIT process.Here's the model for Stamps.comEBIT Valuation ModelThe main thing here is that I'm using a lower-than-expected revenue number to start with, and using an EBIT multiple ranging from 12x on the conservative side to 20x on the aggressive end.This gives an intrinsic range of $21 to $34.The EBIT valuation is showing that STMP is fairly valued to overvalued.Katsenelson PE ValuationRather than go over every detail of how this method works here, be sure to visit the full Absolute PE tutorial.With a current PE of 11.6, the expected growth rate for this PE is 7% based on the table below.PE to Growth Rate Conversion TableStamps.com doesn't give any dividends, so it's a simple calculation from here.These are the scores I'm giving Stamps.com.Inputs and the Fair Value EstimateAnd these are the calculations based on the above inputs.Fair Value CalculationTo sum up the method briefly, you start with the current PE and then apply some adjustments based on the strength of the business.Doing this, the fair value PE comes out to be 13.15, which is equivalent to $37 based on the current EPS.$37 is at the top of the EBIT range, so at this point, I'm inclined to think that the fair value of STMP is currently close to its trading price.Dig Deeper?At this point, no.With the 20% of the work I've done here, it gives a pretty good picture for 80% of the business. But that's because Stamps.com is a business and industry that I am familiar with.To go deeper, you could dive into customer reviews, average revenue per customers, churn rates, conversion rates and other SAAS metrics.Despite the initial good looks, considering the risks, inconsistency of Stamps.com and lack of valuation, it's a pass right now.The OSV Stock Analysis SoftwareIf you are ready to streamline your investment process and make stock analysis and valuation easier, then try old school value today.With just one stock pick using old school value, you can easily pay off your investment for more than 2 years.Even if you just include the amount of time and headache you save, you'll be making a killing.808 value investors can't be wrong.Disclosure: No positions."

According to their website, Stamps.com was the first company to be approved by the U.S. Postal Service® to offer a software-only postage service that lets customers buy and print postage online. They currently serve close to 500,000 subscribers who pay a monthly fee for the access.Basically, they let subscribers purchase and print their own postage from the home or office, saving time and money. This is a simple and effective business model that has been working.Stamps.com's stock is now trading a little under $32/share. This is well below its 52-week high of $49.40 reached in October of 2013. So now that it's 35% below its high, is this the right time to invest? Why did it fall in the first place? Let's answer those questions:What happened since October 2013? Here is the chart:STMP data by YChartsThis chart certainly doesn't look good, but let's get some perspective. Here is the 5-year chart:STMP data by YChartsIt looks like the stock price was getting a little ahead of itself, and pulled back to its more normal growth trajectory. Its earnings and projections back then were just fine and have remained so.It also looks like the stock had some support in the $27.50 area, held that, and has now approached again its 50-day SMA of $32.18 with good relative strength. It has approached that level several times since the October high, and hasn't been able to push through.How about the fundamentals? Let's take a look at those:Valuation:(Source: Fidelity.com)What we have in STMP is a fast growing, lean company (approximately 250 employees) with no debt and attractive valuations.So, what could go wrong? The Investing Engineer on Seeking Alpha did a nice overview here of some of the risks out there, mainly the heavy reliance on a government entity (U.S. Postal Service) to do its job. There are also bigger players that could enter this space as the barriers to entry are not that high.Also, with an average trading volume of approximately 200k shares, it is a little more volatile than some may be comfortable with, although its beta over the past 10 years is 1.01.STMP does not pay a dividend as of now, but does have a share repurchase authorized of up to 1.0 million shares. It did not repurchase shares in Q1 2014. With improving margins and cash increasing, it will be interesting to see how the cash gets used.To summarize, STMP looks attractive at under $32/share based on its valuations and growth potential. It is not without risks, and the stock price has been volatile, but for patient investors, this is a stock worth considering.Disclosure: I am long STMP.

2117733,35161,2014-04-01T08:39:55-04:00,"Since 2010 Stamps.com revenues have grown by 50%; net profit has increased by nearly 800% in the same period.The Company is now partnered with, or integrated with, 37 companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Intuit, Hewlett-Packard and eBay/PayPal.In 2013 Stamps.com averaged 466,000 monthly subscribing customers paying an average $21.51 per month for services.The Company is committed to directing its resources where it will achieve the highest ROI.","Founded in 1996, Stamps.com Inc. (NASDAQ:STMP) was one of the ""dot-com"" businesses that started up towards the end of the 20th Century - in fact, its IPO in 1999 was one of the 457 that occurred that year. It is a software-as-a-service (NASDAQ:SAAS) provider that enables the online purchase of United States Postal Service (""USPS"") postage.The Company is still operating, and although its current share price is less than half of the level it reached in 1999, Stamps.com survived the dot-com shake-out and its growth prospects appear to be going strong. It was the first PC Postage seller on the internet approved by the USPS.As happened with many - if not most - tech IPOs at the time, Stamps.com started off by climbing from its opening day (June 25, 1999) close ($17.50) to a high of more than $78.00 little more than four months later (November 1), then crashing to lows in the neighborhood of $2.50 by the end of 2000. Unlike many other internet companies, however, Stamps.com regained its footing and proved its value, as reflected in the following graph:While its share price is less than half of its high of more than $78.00, Stamps.com is showing more realistic price growth - growth more in line with the Company's performance.The difference between Stamps.com (and other successful start-ups) and the companies that failed when the dot-com bubble burst was that while many companies at the time were built on ""champagne wishes and caviar dreams,"" serious companies were built on efforts to develop some sort of fungible product or service.In the case of Stamps.com, the effort was a matter of two-and-a-half years devoted to pursuing authorization by the USPS to sell legal postage over the internet. That kind of commitment is what it takes to move a company from idea to reality. All that remained at that point was to realize the potential that the idea had.In terms of revenue, Stamps.com has been growing at a very nice rate, alternating a few years of significant growth with a few years of steady revenues, as indicated in the following graph chart:The bottom line, however, is the ""bottom line"": Stamps.com first turned a profit in 2005 and - since 2010 - has grown its profit nearly eightfold, while its revenues have increased by approximately 50% over the same period:The primary increase came in 2011, as an improvement in operating margin (to 17% in 2011 from 2% in 2010) helped fuel an 18.76% rise in revenues (to $101.59 million from $85.54 million)to an increase in net profit of 375% to $26.27 million in 2011 from $5.53 million in 2010 (a net margin of 26%, up from 6% the previous year). The following chart displays the pertinent margins from 2005 through 2013:1Mode of Business: Direct to CustomerStamps.com provides its PC Postage service to customers who pay a monthly service fee, from $15.95 to $35.99 per month, depending upon degree of services required. This is the Company's primary business thrust, which gives customers access to the Company's website and complete line of services available, including various postage classes, USPS services, insurance, etc. Customers range from private individuals and home-based businesses to small businesses, enterprises and high-volume shippers.In 2013 Stamps.com had approximately 466,000 customers paying an average of more than $21.00 per month, accounting for approximately $120 million of the Company's 2013 gross revenues. This includes not only basic postage service, but also the revenues from the supplies that are sold through its online ""store"" (labels, blank stamps, envelopes and other items).In addition to postage and supplies, Stamps.com also offers customers the opportunity to purchase ""customized"" postage stamps through its PhotoStamps product. PhotoStamps enable the customer to order postage-paid ""stamps"" bearing the photograph, business logo, or other suitable design submitted by the customer. These are prepared by Stamps.com and sent directly to the customer, and may be used the same way as regular postage stamps. This product accounted for $4.7 million in revenue in 2013.Perhaps the largest attraction for Stamps.com is that it offers significant discounts on many of the services offered through the USPS which, when added to the convenience of printing one's own postage from one's own computer and printer, constitutes significant savings in time and money. Additionally, the Company recently received approval from the USPS to discount the standard $0.49 postage by $0.01 (to $0.48) for a one-ounce letter - savings that could be significant for a business that sends a substantial number of letters consisting of one page.2Mode of Business: E-commerce IntegrationIn addition to its direct-to-customer operations Stamps.com has succeeded in integrating its software with that of other companies, enabling it to strategically place its services where potential customers can take immediate advantage of them. It has done this in two ways: strategic partnerships, and integration of its software with other e-commerce businesses.Strategic partnerships have enabled Stamps.com to place its services within widely used software and products. Its major partnerships are currently withIn addition to the above major strategic partnerships, Stamps.com has sought to place itself directly within e-commerce businesses. Online marketplaces that provide for customer-purchased postage and shipping using Stamps.com include:In addition to the e-commerce sites above, Stamps.com acquires access to other sites through its integration with shopping cart software provided by other companies:A logical, natural, integration for Stamps.com would be with e-businesses dealing with shipping management, such as the following:Stamps.com is updating its software for new integrations on a regular basis. Its integrations with ChannelAdvisor3 and Bigcommerce4 were accomplished within the past year, and the integration with ShipStation was announced in March, 2014.5Responding to Changing ConditionsPhotoStamps were introduced in 2004 on an experimental basis, and have been an important part of Stamps.com's business since then. While the Company seems to be committed to the product, there is room to question just how committed the company is. Consider the two pie charts below, which break annual revenues for 2006 and 2013 down by business area:Service Revenue (which consists of all postage-related revenue) obviously constitutes the largest part of the company's revenues, accounting for 64% of the total 1n 2006. PhotoStamps was the next-largest revenue source, accounting for 22% of revenues, followed by Store Revenue (mailing supplies) at 10% and Insurance Revenue (Stamps.com's revenues from its own insurance) at 2%. Other Revenue (advertising revenues and other miscellaneous income) was also at 2%.By 2013, Service Revenue had grown to 77% of total revenues followed by Store Revenue and Insurance Revenue, both of which one would expect to grow along with Service Revenue, at 13% and 6%, respectively. PhotoStamps' contribution shrank to only 4% of total revenues, while Other Revenue accounted for 0%.6The shrinking proportion of PhotoStamps' revenue to that of the other businesses is not simply a matter of shrinking relative to the others - it reflects an actual decrease in revenues, as well. Consider the following chart:In 2007 PhotoStamps revenue decreased from 2006's high, and it was the belief of the company that the decrease was largely due to the changing economy - at the same time, costs for the product were up.In 2008 the Company saw a substantial drop in PhotoStamps revenue, and this was attributed both to the economic situation and the decision made after 2007 to decrease spending in marketing the product.7The pattern of continued decreases in revenues from PhotoStamps has persisted to the present, with the exception of 2011, when revenue jumped by more than 15% over 2010, to $8.26 million from $7.16 million (interestingly, costs continued to diminish, no doubt due to continued decreases in marketing and advertising).The increase in revenue, however, was due to the recognition of $2.2 million in ""retail box breakage"" revenue - previously sold but unredeemed product that had been recorded as deferred revenue. Otherwise, sales of PhotoStamps had fallen below 2010 levels, dropping to $6.1 million.8This could be seen as a gradual process of allowing the product to reach a slow death, becoming less and less relevant to the Company's revenues to the point where it would seem reasonable to discontinue the product altogether. For its part, however, Stamps.com has expressed the belief that the product can be revived if economic conditions improve, although it intends to continue decreasing marketing spend on the product.9One could reasonably be concerned, then, that the current relationship between marketing spend and PhotoStamps revenue might present one with a chicken - egg scenario: should Stamps.com wait until sales of PhotoStamps increase before spending more on marketing, or should it decide at some point to increase its marketing push to try to grow PhotoStamps sales?The revenue potential of the product has been proved, and the Company acknowledges that the diminishing sales are - at least partially - due to the decreased marketing effort. As the economy improves it will be incumbent on the Company to decide the future of its PhotoStamps product.""Core"" and ""Non-Core"" BusinessStamps.com differentiates between what it terms ""Core PC Postage business"" and ""Non-Core PC Postage business."" Core business consists of the small-business, enterprise and high-volume customers, and makes up the bulk of the Company's customers. Non-Core business consists of customers acquired through the ""online enhanced promotion marketing channel,"" through which the Company advertises on the sites of other companies who draw customers to Stamps.com by way of additional offers.10In 2013, Core PC Postage business accounted for $120.23 million in PC Postage revenue, while Non-Core PC Postage business contributed $2.88 million. The comparison is rather one-sided, as shown below:The relationship between the revenues of the two businesses has been consistently one-sided, leading the Company to decrease marketing costs in the Non-Core PC Postage business in 2007. At that time, Non-Core business accounted for 11% of the Company's revenue. Because it was shrinking at a time when Core revenues were increasing, and because the attrition rate of Non-Core customers was high, the decision was made to decrease marketing spend on Non-Core PC Postage business.11ProspectsThe principle competition for Stamps.com comes from Endicia, a business group of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL), and Pitney Bowes, Inc. (NYSE:PBI). Pitney Bowes has a long history with the USPS, and is the indubitable leader in the postage and postage meter business. Endicia is a recent startup that operates in collaboration with DYMO, another Newell business.Both Endicia and Pitney Bowes offer services similar to Stamps.com; however, according to USPS figures, Stamps.com has the highest number of PC Postage customers of any PC Postage provider.12 Other competition is nominal, coming primarily from websites that offer postage on their own, and shipping services other than the USPS - primarily United Parcel Service of America, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX).The primary focus for the Company has perhaps been the small business customer, but increasingly Stamps.com is looking toward the larger enterprise and high-volume-shipping companies. The Company seems committed to applying its resources towards those aspects of its business with the highest returns on investment, and its Core PC Postage business seems to offer the highest ROI.Enterprise revenue increased by 36% in 2013, according to a recent earnings call transcript, and high-volume-shipping postage increased by 37%, year-over-year. On the basis of that, the Company intends to focus more resources on attracting customers in those areas. It also intends to pursue further opportunities for integration in the e-commerce arena.13I believe Stamps.com to be a solid company that has positioned itself appropriately to pursue its goals aggressively.DisclaimersThis article is for informational use only.

1879441,35621,2013-12-05T07:41:03-05:00,,"Company OverviewStamps.com, Inc (NASDAQ:STMP) provides subscription based postage solutions for individual customers up to large enterprises. As the company name indicates, the product is web-based, allowing customers to print stamps, labels, etc through their online software. The company exists as a mutually beneficial partnership with the US Postal Service - large customers that bring enough business to the USPS through Stamps.com can have their subscription fee covered by the USPS. That fee typically ranges from $15.99 to $39.99 per month based on the service plan.In 2010 Stamps.com began a partnership with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Marketplace although that is somewhat limited in scope as Amazon has since created it's own shipping label service. In 2011 Stamps.com begin providing their services for the USPS through Click-N-Ship, a feature which grants exposure to eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and thus all shipments through eBay subsidiary PayPal.Risk: USPS RelianceStamps.com is heavily dependent on the USPS; the company is really only a web-based interface with the USPS and a failure of the latter will almost assuredly result in a failure of the former. The likelihood of a USPS failure is a very complicated issue and understanding this risk is critical to investing in Stamps.com.Although a government entity, the USPS is not subject to taxpayer assistance, and instead operates as a private business, surviving on its own operating profits. This unique situation, being a government owned private enterprise, creates its own advantages (such as the Private Express Statutes) and disadvantages. Specifically, competitors like United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) are free to make their own decisions whereas if the USPS wants to implement changes to operations, it literally takes an act of Congress, usually for the worst.The most striking example of this difference is the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) of 2006 which, since passing, has required the USPS to put aside $5.4 to $5.8 billion into the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund every year. This money would go towards funding a full 100% of the retirement health care obligations for the next 75 years. Compare this to industry where there are either no or minimal prefunding obligations and this quickly explains the disadvantage that the USPS is put at. It also explains a great deal of the debt that has resulted in the past several years. Unable to cover this burden, the US Postal Service has defaulted on this payment since 2011. Whether or not this is necessary is debatable. A great explanation of the situation can be found here.Alas, it a complicated issue which leads, unfortunately, to an even more complicated one. The PAEA could be an attempt by Congress to drive the USPS to become a fully privatized enterprise. If that were to occur, it's anyone's guess as to what actions would result between the USPS and Stamps.com. Possibilities include the relationship continuing as if nothing happened; or the USPS could develop its own web-based service and cut ties with Stamps.com; or they could possibly acquire the company outright. As long as the talk is on the USPS getting rid of Saturday delivery and not on becoming a private company, it's probably safe to assume that this scenario is worth shelving in the back of your mind.Risk: Emerging TechnologyOne of the major factors in the USPS' loss of income is the replacement of mail with electronic alternatives, notably email, although to a lesser extent texting and online messaging applications such as those offered through Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). This leaves future profitably more and more in the hands of package shipment. As such, the recent news of Amazon's plans for drone shipment should be interpreted as a real threat to future growth.Although the company states that the technology is 4 to 5 years away, it is perfectly feasible that implementation of drone-based delivery could be available in 2015, pending FAA regulations. For Amazon, the implications are clear; their own delivery system would require no USPS (or UPS and FedEx) aid, eliminating that avenue of profit. Further, as Amazon begins to implement sales taxes in more and more states, cheap shipping looks like the obvious source of creating a price advantage, and their direct competitors, aka. pretty much every other online retailer, will need to keep up to survive. If Amazon gets this to work, they'll only be the first, and Stamps.com will be in serious trouble.On the other hand, this could represent the solution that the USPS needs. Already planning on cutting 35,000 jobs to save up to $2.5 billion annually, implementing their own drone shipping program would allow further employment shrinkage, whether by layoffs or attrition. The benefits to the USPS would of course be a boon to Stamps.com. How likely is this to happen? As stated above, it would take an act of Congress to make a decision on this scale, so interpret that as you wish.It would be very easy to dismiss drone shipping as a gimmick, but these days new technology has a way of quickly changing the world. I would keep a close eye on this and act accordingly.Graham ValuationWith some of the risks discussed, it's time to look at the valuation. Since I'm currently working my way through The Intelligent Investor, I'll be doing this using a mix of several Benjamin Graham investing criteria:Adequate Size of the EnterpriseRight off the bat I'll just say that Benjamin Graham wouldn't have invested in this company (and most likely neither would Warren Buffett). Graham's criteria for adequate size, adjusted for inflation, would imply a company with total market value of no less than $2 billion. Stamps.com has a market cap of $710 million, or about one-third the minimum requirement. Nevertheless, this is simply one factor to consider. Frankly, if you're looking to invest in a relatively new tech company (founded 1998), you've already conceded to a limited exposure to risk. This is just a little more.Strong Financial ConditionBenjamin Graham recommends a current ratio of at least 2-to-1, and Stamps.com meets this. With September 2013 total current assets of $88.80 million and total current liabilities of $14.52 million, the current ratio stands at a healthy 6.12. In addition, Stamps.com has no long term debt, allowing for a good profit margin.Earnings StabilityStamps.com falls short of the recommended earnings in each of the past ten years, but in this case, I'll allow it. The company was only founded in 1998 and didn't have its first profitable year until 2005, taking in $0.44 diluted EPS. After these first seven unprofitable years however, the company continued to grow, netting a 5 year CAGR of 22% (for this calculation I used the averaged 2010-2012 and 2005-2007 diluted EPS). For the first 3 quarters of 2013, Stamps.com already has a diluted EPS of $1.55, although that's behind the 2012 9-month diluted EPS of $1.72.Dividend RecordOther than a special dividend in 2004 and another in 2010, there's nothing to speak of in this category. With a September 2013 cash & equivalents balance of $65.1 million, and 16 million shares outstanding, having no dividend makes sense. To pay out 3% annually would cost $21 million at the current price of $44.15 per share. That $21 million would eat up a third of the available cash. As could be expected with any new company, this money is better spent on research and development, which has cost on average $9.7 million annually from 2010 to 2012.Earnings GrowthBenjamin Graham prefers an earnings growth of at least one-third over the past decade, but as explained above, the company only became profitable in 2005. The 5 year CAGR is 22%, falling short of the mark, while the 3 year CAGR is 85%. While this is a great growth rate, I think the most logical to address this is to simply dismiss it. The earnings, while profitable for 9 years counting the current, are too erratic at this point to get a meaningful growth rate. For those wishing to see a valuation using a Discounted Cash Flow model will have to accept that the numbers would most likely be meaningless until earnings have stabilized.Moderate Price/Earnings RatioAgain Stamps.com misses on this criteria. The recommended P/E is 15, based on 3 year average earnings. Using the previous 12 quarters EPS gives a 3 year average EPS of $1.91. At the current price of $44.15/share, the P/E is 23.11. To get that target P/E of 15, the shares would have to be priced at $28.65 (which seems unlikely), or the EPS would have to grow to $2.94. Given that the 2013 EPS is likely to fall below the 2012 EPS of $2.3, this is also unlikely. On this alone, Stamps.com can't be recommended as a value buy.Moderate Ratio of Price to AssetsWith a book value per share of $9.3 on assets of $164 million, and intangibles and liabilities of $15.6 million, Stamps.com scores a price to book value ratio of 4.74. This lands well over the recommended maximum of 1-½ times book value. Meeting this criteria would put the share price at a deeply discounted $13.95.ConclusionsAs a relatively new tech stock with almost 9 years of profitable growth under its belt, Stamps.com shows great promise. Unfortunately, the current price misses the mark on too many value criteria and therefore can't be recommended as a buy. For investors already holding onto shares, I recommend to continue holding and only buy on a major (20-30%) pullback. If you're interested in getting a quarterly return from earnings, this might be a good time to sell and exchange the shares for a dividend paying stock. For long term holdings, it will be worth watching developments with the USPS and the transforming delivery landscape.Thanks for reading my article!

1632012,24807,2013-08-13T13:13:47-04:00,,"Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) does what you'd expect from a company with stamps in its name - it sells stamps, online, under a subscription-based system. Customers are given the ability to buy stamps directly from USPS, but instead of going to the post office, they can print their own stamps and labels. Stamps.com also gives customers the ability to do things they weren't able to before, like printing stamps with customized photos and printing directly onto the envelope. Even with all of these perks, Stamps.com offers customers discounts on certain postal rates.It's no wonder, then, that Stamps.com has seen its customer base and its revenue increase in recent years. Specifically, it has seen a revenue increase of about 12% for the past three years. But what's more intriguing than Stamps.com's customer-friendly business and its semi-impressive revenue growth is its 84% yearly growth in income for the past three years. You may be used to companies that have costs that increase with revenue - while Stamps.com is no stranger to this economic law, it's about as far as a company can get. As an internet company, and as an internet company whose costs are fairly independent of actual customer demands, Stamps.com has seen its earnings skyrocket as costs have remained stagnant, and revenue has increased modestly. Stamps.com does sell some physical products, and of course as the company grows, overhead grows, but nonetheless its costs have been kept remarkably in check.This is the quirk of their business that, I believe, makes them a potentially wise investment. A look at its annual report shows that as a percentage of total revenue, cost of revenue, sales and marketing expense, research and development and general and administrative costs all decreased in 2012. With this in mind, I will project future earnings up to the end of the year 2016 that take into account revenue growth and a small growth in costs (note that the 10-K report does project both revenue growth and growth in costs, across the board, for 2013).Last year, Stamps.com grew its revenue by about $14 million. Analysts have a very similar projection for the next two years - a $14.5 million growth for 2013, and a $13 million growth for 2014. This would put 2014 revenue at about $143.5 million. Analysts, and Stamps.com's projections, made this part easy. However, getting to final income after tax is a bit tricky as not only are costs not explicitly projected, but Stamps.com has been receiving yearly tax benefits from net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards among other things. But, just to see the growth of the underlying business, projections will be made for income before tax. As for projecting costs, we will estimate that costs will increase by roughly the same amount as they have over the past year. Finally, for the years 2015 and 2016, which analysts have not projected revenue for, it will be assumed that revenue grows at the same rate as it had from 2013 to 2014, minus $2 million.Projected revenue, costs, and income for the years 2013-2016 (in millions)*analyst projectionsWhile these projections are not perfectly accurate, and they do not assist us much in projecting per-share earnings, they shed light on a likely course of corporate growth. Stamps.com has seen, and will continue to see, fairly rapid growth in earnings as revenue rises. As time goes on, earnings growth will slow as the rate of revenue increase drops and possibly, the rate of cost increase, rises. These projections also underscore the company's ability to grow - 2016 earnings of $43,928 million would be about 80% growth in operating income from 2012, or about 16% a year - an impressive figure. What is most assuring about these numbers, however, is that they are under analyst projections. Depending on which analysts you follow, you can find a wide range of projections. In the interest of conservatism, I will use the lowest number I could find, which pegged 5-year EPS growth at 20% (note that this is EPS growth, not operating income growth). A 4% difference in growth between analyst-estimated EPS and our-estimated operating income is significantly small, considering the difficulty in projecting tax benefits and stock buybacks - so small, in fact, that the numbers you see above and the analyst projections are probably both right, or both wrong.So we have seen that Stamps.com has an interesting business with an ability to grow revenue, and not so much costs, but we have not demonstrated how this would translate into a return for you. To project a return, we must project future earnings and future P/E (or, put more broadly, the future of the company and the future of how the market views the company). While we already projected future earnings with both operating income and analyst forecasts, P/E is trickier to predict. If the market as a whole is low, Stamps.com is likely to have a low P/E as well - perhaps in the 10-15 range, as it has been in the past. However, if the market is higher, Stamps.com is likely to have a P/E that is higher than its current P/E - likely in the range of 25-30. With that in mind, we will make four projections - 20% earnings growth with a P/E of 25, then 20, then 15, and 15% earnings growth with a P/E of 10. The future prices, i.e. the prices expected in about 4 years, would be, respectively, $119, $95, $72 and $40. Those prices would translate into respective annualized returns of 31%, 24%, 15%, and -.2%.Each of these numbers, even the one that is negative, is encouraging. Returns of 15, 24 and 31% are all excellent, and the fact that to get a barely negative return the P/E must split in half to 10 (which is approximately equal to the lowest P/E Stamps.com has ever seen) and earnings growth must be somewhat sluggish compared to expectations shows that even in a fairly dismal scenario, large losses are unlikely. Of course, Stamps.com is a young company, and is somewhat volatile, meaning two things. First that the price may drop significantly without cause (i.e. the P/E would drop, which it has done in the past). This is unavoidable and unpredictable - but it also shouldn't worry you if you are a long-term investor. The second item, which is that earnings underperform by more than the 5% that we accounted for (i.e. 15% instead of 20%), is a real risk. However, sufficient evidence for healthy growth has been shown, and, as you will see, the business of Stamps.com is in good health as well.As of now you have a good idea of how Stamps.com will be able to grow and what kind of return you can expect, but you don't necessarily know some of the major aspects of the underlying business that can help to keep your money safe. Stamps.com, aside from its impressive growth, is a truly remarkable company. It boasted a 76% gross margin, and a 33% net margin for the 2012 year. These numbers stand testament to its low cost of revenue as a result of its online business model. It should be noted that the 33% net margin was heavily affected by the tax benefit Stamps.com received. Stamps.com also has no debt, but over $60 million in cash. A key challenge that many companies, particularly small-cap companies, must overcome is strapping debt - the fact that Stamps.com has none makes it all but impossible for it to be in any financial disaster, at least in the near future. I am in no way saying debt is bad, but Stamps.com has been debt free for over 10 years, and has still seen great growth, which is something to be commended. The bottom line - Stamps.com has extraordinary margins and rock-solid financial strength; it's unlikely its business will take a large hit any time soon.Stamps.com is a smoothly run company that has seen high growth in recent years. As long as it can continue to increase revenues and keep costs from growing at the same rate - something it has shown skill in doing - earnings will continue to be on the rise. We have shown that under a variety of scenarios, your investment capital will remain safe, and that even in the unforeseen future, its margins and strength will help protect your money. Stamps.com is an internet company, and a relatively small one at that (compared to giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)); it participated in the rise of the tech boom, and the fall of the tech crash; the recent recession, and the recent recovery. Through all of this, its price has shown great volatility, and at times, the company itself has taken a hit. But while thousands of tech-startups went bankrupt during the tech bubble, and thousands of companies across the board fell into hard times during the recent recession, Stamps.com has survived, and, for the most part, grown. And that's pretty outstanding.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Investors like the deal after a successful acquisition of ShipStation, which has been announced in the summer of last year.The deal occurs at relatively appealing sales multiples after shares of Stamps have nearly doubled over the past six months. Despite the enthusiasm, I would urge for caution. The premium valuation and the fact that I think that core parts of the business have no sustainable future make me cautious.The BusinessStamps is a service, which allows customers and businesses to simply print postage from your regular PC and printer. These stamps are being paid for by the cost of the postage as well as a monthly subscription fee, which ranges between $15.99 and $39.99.Besides stamps, customers can print shipping labels and print the postage directly on envelopes, creating real ease for customers. Users never have to deal with expiration dates, different classes of stamps and excess values again when dealing with their postal issues. Over half a million mailing and shipping customers use solutions provided by Stamps.Besides the fact that its postages are approved by the US Postal Service, the company has other key partnerships as well. This includes Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) merchant marketplace business. This focus on e-commerce has been fortified with the acquisition of ShipStation, which was announced in the summer of last year. The expansion into e-commerce is important as these businesses continue to grow rapidly. The added diversification furthermore reduces the reliance on the US Postal Service, an organization that is dealing with long-term headwinds.Fortifying The BusinessTo further grow the business, Stamps announced that it has reached an agreement to buy Endicia, which is a Newell Rubbermaid subsidiary. The $215 million cash deal of Endicia will aid customers to run shipping operations more smoothly. Endicia provides access to USPS and other shipping services through its integrated applications. These operations generated $59 million in sales over the past year. Based on the reported revenues, Stamps is willing to pay 3.6 times sales for Endicia.With the acquisition, Stamps can improve the strength of the enterprise and small business segment, as high volume shipping continues to grow rapidly amidst the continued adoption of e-commerce.Pro-Forma ImplicationsStamps ended the year with $47 million in cash and equivalents while it had no debt outstanding. The $215 million deal will be financed with current cash holdings of $50 million, resulting in a net debt position of $165 million.The 16.4 million shares which Stamps has outstanding have risen to $62 following the announcement of the deal, thereby valuing equity at $1.01 billion. Including the net debt load, the entire business is now valued at $1.17 billion.Stamps posted sales of $147 million in 2014 on a stand-alone basis, which valued the operating assets at roughly 6 times sales ahead of the deal. Including Endicia, sales will increase to $206 million on a pro-forma basis. Sales for 2015 are seen at $160 to $180 million excluding Endicia, which implies that revenues could come in at $220-$250 million this year.For 2015, the company sees non-GAAP earnings of $2.50 to $2.90 per share, which translates into earnings of $41 to $47 million. GAAP earnings for 2015 are seen at $27 to $33 million.Note that this excludes any contribution from Endicia as the company has not discussed the profitability of the business. In all likelihood, the financing costs of the debt incurred to finance the purchase are likely to consume most of the earnings of Endicia. It should be stressed that earnings in recent times have been aided by large tax returns as operating earnings came in at just $24 million in 2014.As a result, the $1.17 billion valuation translates into a roughly 5 times sales multiple foreseen for 2015. Net earnings are seen at just $27 to $33 million if I assume that financing costs of Endicia will be similar to the profits reported by that business. Based on that assumption and given the favorable tax situation, equity in the business still trades at 35 times earnings.One softening factor is the fact that Stamps is spending a great deal of cash to attract new customers, as the business spent nearly $40 million on customer acquisition costs in 2014. These investments have been hurting earnings, but are required to grow the business.One competitor, which comes to mind is Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI), which is much larger and has shown secular revenue declines in recent years. This business is valued at $7.2 billion, which translates into a 1.9 times sales multiple based on revenues of $3.8 billion. Given the very different growth profiles, direct comparisons are not that applicable as Stamps has little to no other suitable competitors, which are listed on the stock exchange.Growth After StagnationStamps is still a small company, yet it has shown significant growth in recent years. The company had sales of just $62 million in 2005 and those sales have been stagnant around $80-$90 million between 2006 and 2010. Ever since sales have grown to $147 million in 2014, they are anticipated to approach the $200 million mark following the latest acquisition in 2015.On top of the sales growth, the company has managed to reduce the outstanding share base by some 30% over the past decade. Despite the growth, investors have seen a lot of volatility over this time period. Shares have fallen from a peak of $40 in 2006 to mid single digits during the recession, having risen to highs of $60 at current times.Final ThoughtsStamps is an interesting business, which offers nice solutions. The question on my mind is if these solutions are just a temporary solution, or if they will continue to be with us for a long time. I could easily envision a world in which even self-printed stamps will disappear as everything will go digital.To combat these issues and the reliance on the US Postal Service, which is in decline, Stamps is making deals like the one announced today and in 2014. These deals give the company more exposure to e-commerce and new technologies like tracking, among others. Yet I feel that a lot of good news has been priced in at current times. The earnings multiples corrected for the favorable tax returns have been very high.I have my doubts about the core of the business, as I do not think that consumers and small businesses will print stamps any more ten years from now. This concern is somewhat alleviated by the smart tracking solutions and e-commerce capabilities following the acquisition of ShipStation, among others.Other concerns continue to be the very high acquisition costs. In 2014, Stamps spent $40 million to gain a net 46,000 customers, translating into acquisition costs of $870 per customer. This is quite a high amount given that annualized revenues come in around $310 per customer.All in all, I remain cautious. Stamps trades at premium multiples and while it is growing rapidly now, I am not convinced about the long-term outlook of the core business model. Add to that concerns about the premium earnings multiples as net earnings are inflated by tax returns, and the leverage incurred following this latest deal. On the other hand, the company appears to be making good moves in order to expand into e-commerce.All in all, the company has significant opportunities as well as risks in my opinion. This is not an issue as long as the share price reflects this situation. Investors have been very enthusiastic about the recent results, as shares have essentially doubled from levels at $30 in October. Given the premium valuation and significant momentum run, I remain very cautious at this point in time."

The long-term gains given by the company have surpassed what peers have delivered. The company is a provider of internet-based postage solutions. Its customers use its service to mail and ship a variety of mail pieces, including postcards, envelopes and packages. While any firm that generates most of its business online carries risks that aren't inherent in companies with traditional business models, Stamps is proving to be a relatively safe stock with remaining upside that is more likely to be generated in the year ahead.In this article, I will evaluate the company's financial strength by reviewing its latest quarterly performance. Later, I will discuss factors that will support the quantified upside of the company.Third QuarterStamps announced its third-quarter result on November 5th. The company delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 21% as the figure came to $38 million. For an online business, revenue-growth metric isn't as important as how many new customers the company is acquiring and how much they are contributing towards revenue growth. Fortunately, these relevant metrics are healthy for Stamps as the company acquired 67,000 small-business customers during the period. Also, the average subscriber revenue per paid customer ""ARPU"" increased by 12% to $23.86.Investors should note that the third quarter is usually the slowest in terms of business activity for the company. Healthy revenue metrics during this period indicate that Stamps continues to go strong even when the market is seasonally down.Gross margin in the core business area fell by 100 bps to 80.2% in Q3 versus 81.2% in the third quarter of 2013. This happened because the cost of sales included promotional expenses related to customer acquisition. Even though these expenses impacted the margin negatively, the overall impact of an increasing customer base was seen through a growing bottom line.The company delivered an earnings figure of 71 cents per share, which was 15% higher than 2013. All in all, an increasing revenue figure was behind the earnings growth achieved, and investors are likely to see this trend continue owing to the reasons discussed below.Future ProspectsAt first, let's talk about the macro conditions surrounding the industry. It is said that nearly 50% of the stock price movement comes through the industry under which the company operates. Fortunately, Stamps is operating in a market which is growing massively. For the short run, the market is expected to benefit from the holiday season as customers will buy stamps to mail their commodities throughout the country.Secondly, improving economy in the US is driving the growth in online purchases. The US economy grew much faster in the third quarter than projected. It expanded at an annualized rate of 3.9% between July and September, up from the 3.5% first estimated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The rise, which follows a strong second quarter, means the US has seen its strongest two consecutive quarters of growth in a decade this year, and increase in consumer spending is the biggest reason behind.Considering the current macro environment, the North American e-commerce industry is predicted to grow at a rate of 33% and 31.7% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Not only will this growth impact Stamps materially as the products the company sells is considered a staple when it comes to shipping, the acquisitions that are now running successfully will help Stamps get the most out the positive market sentiment.The company acquired ShipWorks during the latest quarter. The acquisition offers monthly subscription-based shipping software which makes it easier to do business for online sellers. ShipWorks solutions integrate with over 50 popular online sales and marketplace systems including eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), PayPal, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Yahoo (YHOO). The acquisition offers many value-adding features such as the ability to send email notifications to buyers, updating online order status and automatic order processing.ShipWorks represents another significant strategic investment by the company in the high volume and e-commerce shipping business. E-commerce driven package shipping is the fastest growing segment within the mailing and shipping market and this acquisition will help Stamps accelerate the growth in the area.However, ShipWorks should not be compared to ShipStation which was acquired some time age. Even though the acquisitions may be considered similar, it should be clear that the two companies differ dramatically in their approach. Whereas ShipStation is entirely web based, ShipWorks is a windows client-based solution provider. It has been observed that customers may prefer one or the other so ultimately both products are strategically fit with the company's long-term goals.Based upon improving industry conditions and the acquisitions which expand the portfolio of services offered, analysts are expecting Stamps to deliver earnings growth of 12% in 2015. This should help the company sustain the stock-price trend in the near future.ValuationThe valuation of Stamps is convincing on most metrics that investors tend to rely on. The trailing PE of Stamps of 16.8x is below the 61.7x industry average, while the forward PE of 16.6x is also below the industry average. The price to book multiple of 4x is 18% lower than the industry average and the price to cash flow multiple of 18.6x is well below the 25.9x industry average. Adding them up reveals that Stamps is undervalued by 43% (see table above). Therefore, the company holds a buy rating."

This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is positioned to win additional business as post office services get pared back.Stamps.com is one of the few ""dot-com"" companies left over from the dot-com era. Founded in 1996, it provides online postage services to about 465,000 registered customers. It targets small businesses, who have historically used the Post Office's postal meters for shipping.Stamps.com software, which is an approved partner of the US Postal Service, allows businesses to print postage with just a PC, a printer and an Internet connection.A Record First QuarterOn Apr 24, Stamps.com reported record first quarter results as it crushed the Zacks Consensus by 48.5%. Earnings were 49 cents compared to the Zacks Consensus of 33 cents.Revenue jumped 13% to $32.1 million with core PC postage revenue rising 16% year over year. The company had its highest level of total paid customers ever at 465,000. It also added the most ever in one quarter, at 30,000.Raised GuidanceAfter the record first quarter, Stamps.com raised its revenue and EPS guidance ranges. The analysts followed suit as the 2013 Zacks Consensus Estimate rose to $1.76 from $1.60 in the last month.That is earnings growth of 19.9% compared to last year. Analysts also see another 8% earnings growth in 2014.Stamps.com is sitting in the driver's seat.

The stock is trading at levels not seen since April 2006.STMP data by YChartsOnly 4 analysts cover this stock and the mean recommendation on the stock is ""BUY"" with a high target of $39.75. As per Yahoo Finance, it was upgraded to ""Outperform"" by Northland Securities on May 7th 2012. After it posted a record EPS of $0.57 this quarter, the stock jumped by nearly 22%. But I believe that the financials do not paint a bullish picture for the stock. And the run in the stock price is likely to be reversed in the coming quarters.The Top LineDue to the seasonality of the business, I have presented below the annual financials from the company's website.(Source: 10Ks)The company revenues have grown significantly from $85.8 million in 2007 to $115.66 million in 2012. But the revenue growth really accelerated in 2011 and 2012, when it grew at 19% and 14% respectively. However, during the same period, Accounts Receivables (AR) grew at a much faster rate of 115% in 2011 and 38% in 2012. It is very surprising that as per the annual reports, while no customer accounted for more than 10% of the revenues since 2009, STMP had one customer/partner that represented approximately 40%, 42% and 21% of the AR in the financial years 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively. Any potential investor should be aware of this development.The Bottom LineWhile the concentration risk has increased in the top line, the policies adopted by the company has made the bottom line highly unpredictable. It now depends a lot on the ""Deferred Tax Assets"" and the release of ""Valuation Allowance"" that will determine the future profitability of the company.As per the latest 10Q, the company has NOL carryforwards of approximately $205 million and $100 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively as of March 2013. In its latest 10K, the company has also stated that:To really capture the effect of NOL Carryforwards on the bottom line, one has to look at the difference between Net income if statutory income taxes were paid and Net Income due to the tax benefits from NOL.One may argue that the Income Before Taxes have also risen substantially from FY2010. But if we factor the ARs of $14 million (Only one customer accounts for 40% of the ARs), then the sustainability of the revenues and the income before taxes becomes questionable.Essentially, the top line is a function of ARs and the Net Income is a function of Total Deferred Tax Assets (or NOL Carryforwards) and Release of Valuation Allowance.With variations in valuation allowance, the company will be able to smoothen/increase the earnings in the short run. But as the Total deferred tax assets keep reducing, the game will end. Some of the tax benefits from NOL carryforwards will expire in 2013 and the federal NOL tax benefits will start expiring in 2020.The Catalyst: Under the IRC code Section 382, if the ""Change of Ownership"" is triggered, the NOL carryforwards may be impaired and the Tax benefits will be partly lost. The latest Form 10Q (March 2013) states that:Thus if institutions began purchasing the shares to take advantage of the company's tax benefits, it may inadvertently impair the very benefits that is giving the company a higher valuation and end the game.Conclusion: I believe that the financials do not make the company's business a long-term investment bet. In fact, gutsy investors can short this stock, when they believe that revenue growth has started slowing down and the ownership levels may trigger a ""Change of Ownership."" This may cause some uncertainty and several 5% owners may sell the stock at the same time and the shorts can benefit from the exodus.(Sources: Form 10Ks and Form 10Qs)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in STMP over the next 72 hours.

Come January 1, dividends will be considered ordinary income and be taxed according to your personal tax bracket.With that in mind, last January, I selected seven companies likely to give large special dividends. The list - Armstrong World (NYSE:AWI), Buckle (NYSE:BKE), Limited Brands (LTD), MTOX Scientific (NASDAQ:MTOX), Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP), Werner Enterprises (NASDAQ:WERN), and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) - is quickly getting smaller. So far, all of them have announced large special dividends except for Stamps.com (and MTOX Scientific which was taken over early this year at a premium). To get on the list, a company had to fill two key criteria: Insiders had to hold a high share percentage and the company had to have given a special dividend in 2010, the last time the dividend tax treatment was scheduled to end.Werner Enterprises, a transportation and logistics company, became the latest to announce, giving investors a $1.50 special dividend in addition to its regular $0.05 dividend. Werner loves to reward its shareholders - this is the fifth consecutive special dividend. This year was different from last year's special - it was much larger as Werner squeezed as much excess cash as possible into the payment before the favorable 15% tax treatment ended. Thank you, Werner.Here's the list of special dividends so far this year.Who's Left On The Special Dividends List?Just about all of my predicted special dividend announcements have come to pass. Only Stamps.com is left.Stamps.com is a cash-laden company and no debt. It's given two special dividends, one in 2004 and one in 2010. Three of the board members own 10% of the company.I'm looking for a $1.00 special dividend.The reasoning: Stamps.com has $37 million in cash on its balance sheet. A $15 million special dividend, or $1.00 a share, will leave the company $22 million - about the amount left after Stamps.com gave its last special.Six down. One remains. Stamps.com, it's up to you.

639821,24491,2012-06-06T02:02:18-04:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Stamps.com's (NASDAQ:STMP) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $24 per share, near where it is currently trading. Our report on Stamps.com and hundreds of other companies can be found here.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. We consider many other fundamental factors (competitive advantages, etc), but these are the main ones we focus on. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for an in-depth presentation on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Stamps.com posts a VBI score of 3 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment, neutral relative valuation versus peers, and bearish techinicals. We use Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Priceline.com (PCLN) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on Stamps.com imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsStamps.com earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 65.9% during the past three years.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $18, we'd take a closer look at adding it to the market-beating portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. In the spirit of transparency, we show the performance of our Best Ideas Newsletter below:.Stamps.com has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 18.4% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter.The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.The firm experienced a free cash flow CAGR of about 41.5% during the past 3 years. We expect its free cash flow growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Stamps.com's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 65.9%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair valueestimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Stamps.com's free cash flow margin has averaged about 9.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Stamps.com, cash flow from operations increased about 52% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 495% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Stamps.com's shares are worth between $18.00 - $30.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $24 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 13.9 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 17.2 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 11.5% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 6.2%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 27.7%, which is aboveStamps.com's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.7% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Stamps.com, we use a 11.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $24 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Stamps.com. We think the firm is attractive below $18 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $30 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Stamps.com's fair value at this point in time to be about $24 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Stamps.com's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $34 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $24 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but fromthe upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: EBAY is included in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter."
441081,27631,2012-03-18T12:25:38-04:00,,"I believe that Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) is highly overvalued and will not deliver the growth implied by the current 22.4x P/E multiple. In fact, there is reason to believe that the >100% share price appreciation since July is the result of unsustainable and at times counter-intuitive trends in financial performance. Immediately following this period of potentially unsustainable momentum, management/insiders liquidated significant holdings, potentially validating skepticism over reported performance and lofty expectations.Furthermore, STMP's recent strength on news that it has settled its IP litigation with Endica is being misinterpreted by the market as a significant positive development for the company. STMP was the originator of the lawsuit, which unsurprisingly resulted in numerous countersuits between the two companies. After numerous years and substantial legal cost, the two companies have agreed to simply not continue to sue one another. STMP did not ""win"" the lawsuit as it was not able to have Endica cease competing with it or gain any sort of monetary payment for its claims. As the company did not take out any legal reserves for the lawsuit, it is unclear why the market viewed the news as a positive catalyst.Brief Business Model Review: STMP operates stamps.com which offers customers subscriptions of $15.99-$39.99 per month for which they can print postage, through a downloadable software application, directly from a personal printer. The product allows for printing on stamps, envelopes or on weighed/metered mail. STMP makes money 4 ways: 1) monthly fee (""Service""), 2) supplies, such as scales and blank stamp sheets, 3) postal insurance, and 4) ""Photostamps"" where customers can print stamps featuring personal designs. The revenue breakdown between these categories in 2011 was 82%, 15%, 2%, 2%. Usage based fees are <20% of revenue, and there is no direct charge per stamp. The business is driven by the ability to attract new customers, given the Service revenue contribution and that >41% of customers cancel their service annually.Negative Option Marketing: Historically, STMP has used ""enhanced promotion"" or ""EP"" (better known as negative option marketing) whereby STMP combines a ""risk-free trial"" with some unrelated give-away ($100 gift card, for example) and fine print to start auto-charging a customer until he cancels the service (which is very, very difficult to do). STMP started de-emphasizing this channel in 2007 as it is generally considered predatory and unethical (it is illegal in parts of Canada for these reasons, for example). Revenue and earnings from angry, duped customers deserve a very low multiple indeed. However, while the non-enhanced promotion business still uses lots of tricks to get sign ups (hence over 41% of the customer base churns annually in non-EP, well over 50% in EP), the recent run up in share price is due to growth in the ""core"" business, which supposedly excludes enhanced promotion.To get a flavor for how STMP communicates dishonestly with customers as well as investors, see the Consumer Affairs website on stamps.com. I also recommend signing up for the service and trying to cancel, to see if you agree with management's description to investors of cancellation as ""easy."" It is worth remembering that the nature of the business tends to have many upset customers.Counter-Intuitive Trends Underlying ""Timely"" Non-Enhanced Promotion Business Growth beginning in 2Q 2011Sudden Acceleration in ""Core"" PC Postage Revenue: The stock has run up on an increase in growth in the ""Core"" PC Postage business, which - according to the Company - excludes enhanced promotion. Reported growth accelerated significantly in 2Q 2011 to 23% from 14% the quarter before.Productivity in Enhanced Promotion Inexplicably Dropped: When STMP began to cut back on marketing dollars for Enhanced Promotion (""EP""), one would have expected the lowest ROI dollars to be cut, bringing up the average Y/Y productivity of the remaining spend. This is what happened in each quarter since the change in 2007; however, that trend changed markedly in 2Q 2011.Non-EP Service Revenue Inexplicably Increased: Core (non-EP) Service revenue can be calculated because essentially all EP revenue is Service (I have confirmed this with management). Core Service Rev/Customer suddenly increased, by coincidence, also in 2Q11, which also bucks a long term trend. We can tell that the inflection point in 2Q was likely not the result of the logical core business drivers. The increase was not caused by lower churn: Paid Customer Cancel Rate actually increased sequentially by 17% in 2Q when sequential Non-EP Service Rev/Cust grew by 6%. It was also not caused by more SMBs signing up, who might pay higher fees: SMBs added shrank Q/Q by 6% in 2Q11 while Service Rev/Cust grew by 6%The chart below shows the timing and magnitude of the shifts that preceded the ""timely"" stock price appreciation. Note that EP Marketing Productivity is calculated as EP Marketing Spend / EP RevenueHow Much Growth Could This Have Represented?: If EP productivity had not inexplicably changed, EP would have accounted for significantly more revenue. If one were to run-rate the Q1 level and accounting for seasonality, the ""missing"" revenue would have represented 25% of the reported growth in the ""Core"" business in the 4Q11 and 16% and 17% of the growth in 2Q and 3Q 2011. While the Core business is no doubt growing, the business momentum (and likely the share price on the dates at which insiders sold) is related to the degree of inflection in 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q 2011.Lowered Expectations: On the 4Q 2011 conference call, management guided to significantly lower growth in 2012. Although they do not give explicit guidance, they guided to a 10%-15% increase in customer acquisition spend, which is a deceleration compared to an approximate 17.5% increase in 2010. As the business has ample cash, and if momentum is as strong as previously stated, why would management slow down investment now? It is worth noting that management owns almost no shares now, so near term increases in share price would not benefit management as shareholders (this is one of the reasons management teams are often paid in stock: to create shareholder alignment). Further, higher share prices do - of course - mean that any new option or share grant to management will have higher strike/issue prices.Massive Insider Liquidation: Reason to be Skeptical of MomentumSTMP has several aspects of its management compensation structure that are unusual and, combined with management behavior, do not suggest long term belief in the Company's performance. The Company's 2010 14A Proxy (2011 14A not yet filed) confirms that management has received $0 in equity-based comp over the last 3 years and that essentially all options ever granted vested during Q2 2011 (page 22). No members of management currently own significant stock outside of options. The CEO and CFO/Co-President owned 485,040 and 147,164 options respectively at 12/31/2010 with strikes from $7.08-$13.40. And you'll note pasted below from the Company's 2010 14A Proxy that the final meaningful chunk of options vested during 2Q 2011.In November 2011, both the CEO and CFO liquidated their holdings. The CEO exercised and sold 100% of his options though 7 transactions from 11/1-11/9, when the share price ranged from $31.00-$26.90 (below the price at time of writing) and currently holds just 4,800 shares of stock. The CFO exercised and sold >99% of his options over the same period through 3 transactions and currently holds 1,475 shares. This netted the CEO and CFO roughly $10 million and $3 million respectively and left them with effectively no shareholder alignment. Other members of management have been selling as well. A link to the form 4's for disclosure of insider selling.The table below compares STMP's CEO compensation structure with a set of similarly sized peers and helps illustrate the unusual fact that management currently holds very little equity interest in the company.The largest STMP shareholder is Lloyd Miller III, a Director, who has an exceptional track record of selling at the top as well. In 2006, the last time the stock was above $15.00 for a sustained period, Miller had a period of concentrated selling which was followed immediately by a drop from $38.81 to <$15.00; a >54% decline in just 6 months. In January 2012, Miller began his only other period of concentrated selling. He sold 525,045 shares for over $16 million (roughly 4% of the Company's market cap) from 2/7/12-2/12/12. On February 24, he further filed to sell 750,000 shares ($19.7 million worth) according to a ""pre-arranged schedule."" This represents a sale of roughly 75% of the holdings of the largest shareholder and best-trading insider (and roughly 5% of the market cap). The chart below shows Miller's buys and sells over the last 10 years; the takeaway is likely obvious (i.e., the man has an uncanny ability to sell before the stock price moves sharply lower).Valuation ImplicationsWith a 10%-15% increase in customer acquisition spend and customer acquisition costs essentially flat over the last 5 years, management is projecting marked deceleration in growth. Because 82% of the revenue is Service, directly linked to customer count, at the mid-point, this equates to guidance of 14.5% revenue growth in 2012 (assuming the non-Services component grows at 23%) down from 20+% the last 3 quarters. As Service is ~100% gross margin, the mix change will also lead to margin compression. The Company is adding to ""R&D"" so bottom line growth is questionable as well. A business with declining gross margins, decelerating growth, and nearly half of the ""core"" customer base cancelling annually does not deserve a premium multiple. At an S&P multiple of trailing EPS of 15.5x, the stock has roughly 30% downside from the current levels. Note that the reported 2011 EPS of $1.73 per share includes $0.56 from the reversal of a deferred tax asset allowance, and thus Adj. LTM EPS is 33% lower than reported. However, the combination of: (i) an unusual lack of management alignment with shareholders, (ii) alarming level of recent insider selling and (NASDAQ:III) and counter intuitive and questionable financial trends (which historically tends to increase fraud risk, as any business school professor would tell you), I believe the business should be valued at a significant discount. My price target for STMP is $10, 8.5x LTM P/E, reflective of the significant risks and capped upside in the business at this point, and the >$4/share of cash the business has on its balance sheet.Other Relevant Data Points:Potential Catalyzing Events to the Downside:Risks:The fundamental functionality of the STMP product is actually not bad, and - while there may well be some ""enhanced promotion"" of numbers going on here - the Company is unlikely to go bankrupt in the near term. Key risks to the short thesis are:While a dividend seems unlikely (as it's being considered a growth stock), the company has returned cash to shareholders before and with the insider selling taking place, the Company could authorize a buyback which might help the stock.Disclosure: I am short STMP.Additional disclosure: I have no positions in OSTK, EHTH, GSIT or FLWS.

In Stamps.com's (NASDAQ:STMP) case, we think the firm is significantly overvalued. We think it is fairly valued at $16 per share (our report on Stamps.com and other companies can be found here).For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more information on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Stamps.com scores a 1, the worst rating on our scale (reflecting its overvaluation and bearish technicals).Our Report on Stamps.com imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsStamps.com earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 127.7% during the past three years.Although we don't think the firm's valuation indicates an attractive investment opportunity at this time, we'd take a closer look if the firm's share price fell below $12. The market seems to be pricing greater long-term revenue growth and profit expansion than we think is achievable.Stamps.com has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 16.6% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.The firm experienced a net income CAGR of about -19.7% during the past 3 years. However, we expect its net income growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital ROIC with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Stamps.com's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 127.7%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Stamps.com's free cash flow margin has averaged about 9.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at www.valuentum.com. At Stamps.com, cash flow from operations decreased about 59% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 76% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Stamps.com's shares are worth between $12.00 - $20.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $16 per share represents a price-toearnings (P/E) ratio of about 42.6 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 94 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 10.5% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of -0.1%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 24%, which is above Stamps.com's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.5% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Stamps.com, we use a 11.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $16 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Stamps.com. We think the firm is attractive below $12 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $20 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Stamps.com's fair value at this point in time to be about $16 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Stamps.com's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $22 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $16 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
317324,25084,2012-01-04T09:55:53-05:00,,"Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) is the leading provider of USPS-approved, software-only electronic postage. The company offers a breadth of mail classes to its customers, which range from individuals to large businesses. The postage is printed onto stick-on labels, or directly onto envelopes, using any printer. Customers pay a fee between $15.99 and $39.99 per month to use the service, in addition to postage. Bulk mailers can receive discounts on select mail classes. The company’s most popular item, NetStamps, lets customers print out stamps of any price, eliminating the fuss of mixing and matching postage.Stamps.com (“Stamps”) offers service that is cheaper than its competitors’. Unlike chief rival Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI), Stamps customers don’t need to purchase or rent postage meters. Postage meters commonly involve a monthly service fee, plus added costs for maintenance, insurance and toner cartridges (which can run hundreds of dollars). Additionally, Stamps’ service can be canceled without penalty. Pitney Bowes customers enter into a lengthy lease with steep cancellation fees. Pitney Bowes deployed a Web-based postage service in 2004, in conjunction with eBay. Endicia [owned by Newell/Rubbermaid (NASDAQ:NWL)], Stamps’ other competitor, traditionally operated in large volume shipping, but now offers services similar to Stamps. Endicia offers a basic plan for $9.95 a month. Stamps has no other direct competition, as the USPS has licensed only these three companies.Stamps has over 400,000 customers, and that number is growing. The company estimates there are 50 million potential customers in the United States. We estimate Stamps’ market share could increase from the current 0.8% to around 5% (2.5 million customers). Businesses are defecting from Pitney Bowes, whose machines cost up to 80% more per month to operate than Stamps. However, considering the steep buyouts, most companies are waiting until their leases end with Pitney before switching to Stamps.In addition to the cost savings, larger companies are embracing Stamps’ software. The software, which is included at no extra cost, automatically manages and records orders and shipments for a company’s remote offices. It can also be combined with various e-commerce sites like Amazon and eBay, which aids smaller businesses.Convenience is the company’s main allure. Customers simply print out exact postage instead of taking lengthy trips to the post office. Stamps can be printed out individually or in bulk. All mailing addresses are automatically verified (using the USPS database) by Stamps beforehand, so customers won’t waste postage by shipping to undeliverable locations. Several small business customers have noted that the printed postage looks more professional than traditional stamps. Stamps keeps an easily accessible history of every parcel a user sends for straightforward record keeping. The company’s service was integrated with Amazon.com Marketplace in July 2010. Stamps won a contract to provide electronic postage for the USPS Click-N-Ship service last February.Customers also enjoy discounted postage rates, and other services. Users receive discounts of up to 15% off for Priority Mail and up to 21% off Express Mail. Customers that meet certain volume benchmarks qualify for larger discounts: up to 28% off Priority, and up to 32.5% off Express. Delivery confirmation costs between 40 and 70 cents less per package than it would at a post office. However, with the monthly service fees that apply, Stamps is not ideal for infrequent mailers.It remains to be seen how the decay of the USPS will affect Stamps. The company could mop up customers from areas where offices scale back hours or are closed altogether. But by the same token, businesses may cut back on mailing should the Postal Service decide to do the same with delivery hours and routes.Revenue should make a significant leap in 2011, after holding steady around $85 million the last four years. We project year end revenue of $100 million, up 17% from $85.5 million last year. We anticipate fully taxed earnings per share of $.85 for the year, an 85% increase from $.46 in 2010. Share earnings could jump another 24% to $1.05 for 2012. Diluted shares outstanding should increase to 16.5 million to 17.0 million in the fourth quarter 2011, from 15.5 million.Target revenues of $200 million are realistic in the next two to three years, with fully taxed EPS of $2.00. Stamps has more than $200 million in tax loss carry-forwards, so it won’t have to pay cash taxes for five to seven years. Earnings excluding income taxes would be $3.00 a share. We anticipate a target price of $50 a share, an appreciation potential of 100% from the current quote. Stamps is based in Los Angeles, CA. (Click to enlarge)Disclosure: I am long STMP."

He said that Stamps.com's new customer adds fell below expectations due to pop-up blockers, spam filters and other factors.

29905,20367,2007-03-19T10:10:31-04:00,,"Before heading into any analysis of Stamps.com’s financials or business prospects, it is necessary to clear up any misconceptions that the .com portion of their name may create. This is not a typical internet company, nor should it be valued as one. As the seller of a boring product with limited growth potential, Stamps.com is better looked at as a retailer with modest but above average growth rates. Through an agreement with the United States Postal Service, Stamps.com enables customers to directly purchase and print out approved postage right from their homes or offices. The majority of their revenues are derived from their PC Postage service, which allows customers to print out postage in the form of a bar-code, generating $16.9 million in sales in the most recent quarter, an increase of 15% over the prior year’s comparable period. PhotoStamps, a service patented by Stamps.com, accounted for the rest of the company’s revenue and is the faster growing segment, generating sales of $8 million in Q4 2006, an increase of 35% versus Q4 2005. As a whole, Stamps.com reported sales of $25 million and net income of $4.7 million or $0.20 per share in the 4th Quarter and earnings of $0.69 per share for the full year 2006. Selling a boring product and nothing more, this is a rather boring company. That is not a bad thing. With boringness comes consistency. Unless we wake up to one day find mail obsolete in our country within the next few years, this is a company with a strong recurring customer base that should continue to expand as more and more individuals and businesses discover the ease at which they can purchase their postage without leaving their homes or offices. Competition would be hard pressed to find competitive advantages over the service Stamps.com offerings, given the virtual absence of ability to undercut Stamps.com’s prices, as postage sells at a fixed rate determined by the United States Postal Service no matter who the reseller is. Given these facts, Stamps.com does not appear to be at risk of experiencing declining revenues or rapidly eroding gross margins in the foreseeable future. The strength of Stamps.com balance sheet is extremely noteworthy. With a market cap of only $323 million, the $106 million of cash of their balance sheet represents an amount equal to over $4.65 per share and to nearly 1/3 of their current market value. The company is using this large cash position to benefit shareholders through a recently authorized $20 million share repurchase plan, on top of an already completed $32 million in share buybacks since 2005. Stamps.com is currently expecting 2007 revenues of $90 to $100 million and earnings per share between $0.70 and $0.80. Given the authorized buyback in place, they are positioning themselves to come in at the high end of that earnings range. As mentioned previously, this company is more appropriately valued as a retailer than an internet company, considering they operate in a very contained niche. Taking this into account, a P/E of 20 is justifiable for a retailer with above average growth rates, especially considering their web based business is less capital intensive allowing for greater retained earnings than a typical brick and mortar retailer. By using an earnings target in the middle of company released guidance, $0.75, and applying a multiple of 20, we arrive at a fair enterprise value of $15.00 per share. If their buyback enables them to hit the high end of their guided range, $0.80, an enterprise value of $16.00 is fair. Add in $4 per share in cash, and we arrive at a fair market value of $20.00 within the next 12 months. Disclosure: Author Joseph Urgo does not have a position in Stamps.com.

Let me explain…Sunday, The New York Times reported the USPS “is so low on cash that it will not be able to make a $5.5 billion payment due this month and may have to shut down entirely this winter…” Hundreds of local branches of the USPS have slashed hours. Others have closed down altogether. And Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe is now pushing to eliminate Saturday mail delivery and close an additional 3,700 post offices around the country – on average 74 per state!In short, the USPS’s inefficient business model is a short-seller’s dream come true.Of course, unlike Fannie Mae, you can’t short the Post Office directly.

Stamps.com is the only publicly-traded firm catering to individuals and small business owners who simply don’t have the time or patience to wait on line at the post office. And it’s exactly the type of company whose success is a direct result of the government’s failure to deliver.It’s almost completely unknown to the investing public. I haven’t seen a single feature article on this stock – but that’s about to change, because its growth is becoming hard to ignore.A Look Under the HoodLike any successful retail business, STMP is doing well because it solves a critical problem – saving its customers hours of unproductive downtime – waiting in line at the local post office. Additionally, STMP saves its customers cold hard cash. According to its website, in exchange for a monthly fee of $15.99, subscribers receive a free digital scale which hooks up to any PC or MAC and allows you to print postage at home.Subscribers also receive discounts of up to 21% off Express Mail shipments and up to 15% off Priority Mail rates. Once you print and stamp your package or letter, you can simply leave it outside for the mail carrier or drop it off at the nearest post office or mailbox, without standing in line. The company has postage partnerships with several top mailing label manufacturers, including Avery Dennison (NYSE:AVY) and Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ), as well as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the US Postal Service.By the Numbers…Q2 2011 marked STMP’s best quarter in history.On the heels of the revenue announcement, the stock rose 27% from the mid $13 mark to $17.41 and hit a 52 week high of $19.95 before pulling back to $19.24 last Friday.Is it still a fair value at $19.24? I believe it is. For the simple reason that the U.S. Postal service is hell-bent on destroying itself slowly through run-away pension spending, staff cut-backs and regional closures.With each following closure or cut-back, the USPS will become less user-friendly and less accessible to its customers who will likely seek a better deal somewhere else. And unlike some dot-com stocks – STMP is quite profitable, trading at 25 times earnings, with a forward P/E of 14.Compare that to richly held LinkedIn (LNKD), which is trading at a whopping 1,144 times earnings, and Pandora Media (NYSE:P) which is not even remotely profitable, and STMP seems like a relative bargain.Management also appears to be confident. Stamps.com is aggressively buying back shares. The company purchased 232,000 shares in the second quarter of 2011 and it's authorized to buy back 600,000 more this year.And notably, it has not taken on a penny of debt. It's sitting on $23.23 million in cash – not an insignificant stash when you consider its tiny $274M market cap.Potential Threats to GrowthUSPS Shutdown: If the U.S. Postal Service literally shut down, that would cut off STMP’s chief source of revenue. However, this threat – while possible – is extremely unlikely to occur. In fact, any situation that allows the USPS to “muddle through” will be extremely beneficial to STMP because more and more USPS customers will be itching to abandon their daily or weekly trip to the post office.I suspect we will see a full-scale bailout or reorganization of the USPS in 2012. And I’m predicting a lot more than 3,700 post office closures. I would not be surprised to see 33% of all post offices close down within the next 3 to 5 years, ultimately replaced with some kind of RedBox-style automated service center which would be located in supermarkets, strip malls or convenience stores.Competition: STMP is in a unique niche of the market that serves small business owners and individuals – so it is not in direct competition with big-name commercial shipping processors like Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI).There is one smaller rival in the same print-at-home business, the privately held Dymo Endicia. But thanks to onerous licensing and approval process – in which the USPS takes its sweet time – it’s somewhat difficult for more competitors to enter the market.The greater threat would be if the Post Office actually got its act together and offered an online postage experience as good or better than Stamps.com. But I wouldn’t hold my breath. The only purpose of most government agencies is to grow for the sake of growth – not actually improve the way they work on the ground level.Bottom linePostage is moving online. Just like movies. Just like music. Just like anything else that can be effectively digitized. As we speak, 35% of all postal revenue is coming from internet postage. We expect that number to top 50% in short order. Stamps.com is best positioned to benefit from this massive growth potential.Disclosure: I am long STMP."
33032,20333,2007-04-22T05:45:58-04:00,,"Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) is took a big hit on Friday on a weaker than expected 2007 forecast. Growth has stalled; in fact revenues were down year over year. The company saw a big decline in their photostamps business despite higher marketing spending. It isn't immediately clear why this business has fallen off. But it appears that Stamps.com will refocus on their PC software business. Stamps.com looks fairly cheap. Pro-forma free cash flow minus option expense is about $0.78/share. The company has no debt and about $4.70 in cash per share. They have been and will likely continue to aggressively repurchase shares. Stamps.com enjoys a safe little competitive niche. The business enjoys huge margins with big returns on capital.    Stamps.com has significant deferred tax assets valued at about $102 million, most of which don't begin expiring until 2018. These tax assets are not listed on their balance sheet as the company is making the worst case assumption that they are all forfeited. At present they are paying almost zero taxes. It is possible that the company loses these assets if a shareholder owning more than 5% of the company makes a big shift in their holdings. We think it unlikely that this will happen. Any investor willing to buy over $14 million in Stamps.com shares isn't going to do something which would hurt the long-term value of the company by several dollars a share. We think the primary negative of the provision is it dissuades a lot of the larger small-cap institutional investors from buying the stock. At present it looks like 2008 analyst estimates are assuming that Stamps.com becomes a full taxpayer. Should the company lose the tax assets, free cash flow would probably be closer to 50 cents a share. Full Disclosure: We own shares of Stamps.com. STMP 1-yr chart:"

9103,20140,2006-04-18T00:01:05-04:00,,"Please don't misunderstand. Stamps.com (NASD:STMP) has a nifty business. The company is one of the leading providers of Internet-based postage services. Maybe the leader. The company's PhotoStamp products, which allow people to put their own photo content onto their postage stamps, is a hot idea and the company shipped about seven million PhotoStamps in Q4 05, a big increase over previous periods. Revenue last year rose from $38.1 million in 2004 to $61.9 million, a 62% clip. The fourth quarter grew even faster with revenue up 76% to $20.6 million. For the full year the company had income from operations of $8.4 million compared to a loss of approximately $7 million in 2004. But, guidance is for things to slow down a bit: The company expects 2006 revenue to be between $75 and $90 million, a pretty wide range, and much slower than either Q4 05 or full-year 2005 growth. At the lower end of guidance, the Stamps.com's revenue would only go up 21%. Talk about full flaps. Stamps.com's stock has gone from $15.05 in the 52-week period to almost $37. With a market cap that is nearly 14 times revenue, this puts them well ahead of companies like Yahoo! (NASD:YHOO) and EBay (NASD:EBAY) in that department. It is worth noting that Stamps.com devotes a lot of space in its 10-K to Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI) as a competitor. The Pitney Bowes postage meter business gets hurt by a service like Stamps.com, so the business equipment behemoth has made several attempts to move into the online end of postage. It's probably safe to assume that they are not going to give up. STMP 1-yr Chart Douglas A. McIntyre is the former Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of Financial World Magazine.

101079,22064,2008-10-22T05:44:48-04:00,,"Stamps.com is scheduled to report third quarter 2008 results after the market closes on Thursday, October 23. Based on our analysis, we at eChristianInvesting are expecting STMP to report disappointing results that miss Wall Street’s consensus expectations. We are forecasting revenues of $20.5 million and EPS of $.13. This would represent a 1% increase in revenues from last year’s $20.3 million in the same period. The current analyst consensus calls for revenues of $21.1 million and $.14 EPS. On July 23, the company gave full year guidance for revenue of $80 - 90 million and EPS of $0.55 – 0.65. Management indicated that they were beginning to see some weakness in their business due to macroeconomic conditions on their 2nd quarter earnings call.Based upon the economic developments of 3rd quarter, we believe that this weakness will be magnified in the upcoming quarterly results. In addition, our checks show a summer slowdown in traffic during July and August which could also weigh on the top line numbers.To date, Stamps.com shares are down only 12%. They have consistently been one of the better performing stocks this year, having easily outperformed the S&P 500’s dismal 35% loss (YTD).Shares are now trading at a reasonable 16x consensus 2009 EPS estimates. This is below the relative valuations of their peer group. While STMP’s reasonable valuation (along with over $4 per share in cash) makes it appear attractive, we believe that the potential for disappointing quarterly results along with the expected reduction in full year guidance makes it risky to buy this stock right now.Hold with a $9-10 price target.Disclosure: none"

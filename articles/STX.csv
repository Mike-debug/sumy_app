The company is trying to make the transition to mass capacity. But mass capacity growth depends on increasing HDD capacity, which in turn requires increased areal density. Current HDD technology is nearing the end of the road and Seagate plans to release a successor in December. How this could potentially determine the future of Seagate will be covered next.Both revenue and net income came in slightly better than guidance had called for. Nevertheless, Q1 revenue still declined by 10.24% YoY to $2.3B. Non-GAAP net income and EPS decreased by 12.95% and 9.71% to $242M and $0.93 respectively. Results got a lift from the recovery in the video and image application market.Source: Seagate Form 8-KGuidance calls for Q2 revenue of $2.35-2.75B. An increase of 10% QoQ, but a decrease of 5.42% YoY at the midpoint. Non-GAAP EPS is seen at $0.95-1.25. An increase of 18% QoQ, but a decrease of 18.5% YoY at the midpoint.In addition, FY2021 revenue is forecast to stay flat compared to FY2020 revenue of $10.5B. Mass capacity exabytes is expected to grow faster than the CAGR goal of 35-40%. In a sign of confidence, Seagate announced a 3% increase in quarterly dividend and a $3B increase to the share repurchase program.COVID-19 has led to disruptions everywhere, including at Seagate. Nevertheless, Seagate expects improvement from here on out. From the Q1 earnings call:A transcript of the Q1 FY2021 earnings call can be found here.However, there were some setbacks. The enterprise market started to weaken, a major issue because the segment greatly contributed to growth in previous quarters.Mass capacity lost some steam as can be seen in the table below for Q1 product mix. Seagate is a company that needs to move away from relying on legacy products to mass capacity. Anything that could potentially disrupt mass capacity growth is a concern and deserves attention.Source: Seagate Q1 reportSeagate believes the slowdown is only temporary. The outlook sees enterprise IT spending recovering and picking up in calendar year 2021. Cloud data center demand is expected to improve in the December quarter and throughout the rest of FY2021.Nevertheless, there are questions about whether mass capacity can keep growing like it has in the past. While there has been a great increase in mass capacity exabytes, this growth has yet to move the top and bottom line in a significant way. Persistent price erosion has been a factor. A previous article delves deeper into this issue.If Seagate had to ramp up mass capacity just to keep revenue from falling like it has in recent years, the question becomes what will happen if there are severe constraints to mass capacity growth. In order for mass capacity growth to continue at a torrid pace, HDD capacity must rise as well. Seagate needs bigger drives than the 16-terabytes HDDs now shipping.This can only be done by raising the areal density of HDDs. Seagate intends to accomplish this by introducing its first Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording or HAMR drives in December 2020 after years of delay. Current CMR and SMR drives are approaching their ceiling and if Seagate is to offer higher-capacity drives, technological advancements will be needed as replacements.Seagate points out the importance of HAMR when it states in the earnings call that:The first HAMR drives will have a capacity of 20 terabytes, but that could go up to 50 terabytes in 2026. Higher capacities will accommodate mass capacity growth.The underlying principles of HAMR have been around for decades, but there are good reasons why the technology has yet to make its debut in HDDs after all this time. Many technical challenges have delayed the commercialization of the technology. A previous article delves deeper into why HAMR may be prone to malfunctioning, which is not something you want since HDDs are entrusted with storing data. HAMR may work fine initially, the question is what happens over time after extended use.HAMR could be released soon and the skeptics may be proven wrong, but the risk with HAMR is that it suffers from problems during real world use. Problems which can happen unexpectedly. Such an outcome could have great ramifications for Seagate, which has a lot riding on HAMR. A trip back in history serves as a reminder of what could go wrong.IBM (IBM) used to be a major manufacturer of HDDs. The products were marketed as the Deskstar series. In 2001, reports surfaced that certain Deskstar models suffered from high failure rates. It's believed the use of IBM's innovative Giant Magneto-Resistive or GMR technology led to crashes. The reliability of these Deskstar HDDs resulted in a class-action lawsuit in 2001 against IBM. As a consequence of this ordeal, IBM exited the HDD industry never to return again. The HDD division was sold a year later in 2002.This episode serves as a reminder of what could potentially happen to Seagate if HAMR does not live up to expectations. And in this case, the stakes are much higher. IBM did not depend on HDDs like Seagate does. IBM's core business lies elsewhere and it could afford to leave HDDs behind. Seagate is not in the same position. Seagate needs HAMR, because the company cannot move ahead as it plans to without it. Mass capacity cannot grow at the rates it's expected to if HDD capacities do not keep up.Source: Wikimedia CommonsSeagate is a company in transition with the legacy part of the company shrinking. SSDs made of NAND memory chips have cornered many segments of the market to the point that Seagate had to focus on mass capacity. NAND continues to evolve at a rapid pace, which means that HDDs have to also in order to keep up with the competition.HDDs tend to be cheaper than SSDs of equal capacity. But this advantage is under siege because SSDs have been going down in price as a result of technological innovations like 3D-NAND. The cost of HDDs per terabyte has had to come down, leading to price erosion. The consequence is that even though Seagate has greatly increased HDD exabytes shipped, revenue has remained more or less flat.If mass capacity is to keep growing as projected, higher capacity HDDs than the current 16 terabytes are needed. Current drives based on PMR/CMR and SMR technology are approaching their technical limits and a replacement is needed if areal density is to enable HDDs with higher capacities. The solution from Seagate is HAMR, which is expected to make its debut in a couple of months. In theory, HAMR could allow for HDDs with much greater capacities than is currently possible. HAMR would open the door for continued growth in mass capacity.But there's a reason why companies have shied away from using the technology HAMR is based on. The technology comes with great technical difficulties. So much so that many engineers became hesitant to using it. The concern is the technology could cause HDDs to fail prematurely, which is a major problem since HDDs are entrusted with storing data that cannot be lost.It's possible HAMR could turn out to be fine. On the other hand, the laws of physics suggest that HAMR faces a daunting task in ensuring long-term reliability which will stand up over time. If HAMR turns out to be a technological dead end, Seagate will find itself in a precarious position from which it may not be able to recover.Keep in mind revenue on a TTM basis peaked at $16.3B at the end of 2012. It fell to $9.9B seven years later, despite mass capacity growth. If mass capacity had not grown as fast as it did, revenue would have shrunk even more than it did. While current HDDs should last a while, they will be rendered obsolete eventually as long as NAND keeps pushing forward. Imagine if mass capacity can no longer grow as it has because HDD capacity has hit a wall. Seagate would find itself in a situation where it no longer has the last pillar holding everything up.I am neutral on Seagate. The company is in a tough spot with HAMR. It has no choice but to pursue something others have shied away from using for years. Seagate has essentially bet the house on a high-risk, high-reward solution with HAMR. Time will tell if it's to be rewarded for this decision. But if history repeats itself and Seagate finds itself in the same position as IBM did almost twenty years ago, Seagate's stock is likely to fare much worse because it has no other path forward unlike others. HAMR is about to enter the market, but anyone long Seagate faces the risk of a sudden haircut as long as HAMR remains unproven."
4381385,103480,2020-10-26T13:51:57-04:00,"Storage maker Seagate has raised its dividend and boosted its buyback authorizations, despite shaky fundamentals.The company's shares fell ~3% after reporting Q3 results, though the drop would likely have been steeper in the absence of boosted shareholder returns.Revenue and margins have crumbled in the wake of the coronavirus, and Seagate's free cash flow is barely enough to cover its existing capital returns plan as-is.Rivals like Western Digital have suspended, rather than boosted, their own dividend programs.","It's no secret that Storage vendors are having an incredibly tough year this year. Revenue is down due to lockdowns that have shuttered points of sale for products carrying Seagate (STX), and margins have fallen on pricing pressures as well.Seagate, one of the world's largest makers of hard drives (HDD), has been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus. Shares are down ~20% this year, dramatically underperforming a ~7% rise in the S&P 500. The company also recently reported fiscal Q1 results and shares fell another ~3% on the news.Data by YChartsThe post-earnings drop, in my view, would have been much steeper had Seagate not ""sweetened the deal"" by boosting its shareholder returns program. Alongside its first-quarter results, which in themselves were quite dour, Seagate committed to boosting its quarterly dividend by 3% (from $0.65/share to $0.67/share) as well as boosting its total dividend repurchase authorization to $4.2 billion. With a current market cap of ~$13 billion, that authorization would knock out a third of Seagate's market cap.Figure 1. Seagate capital returns updateSource: Seagate Q1 earnings deckFrom a high level, Seagate looks like an attractive value proposition. This is a stock trading at ~11x Wall Street's consensus FY21 pro forma EPS target of $4.64 (-6% y/y; data from Yahoo Finance), and if we carry a $0.67 quarterly dividend over four quarters, the stock is yielding a decent 5.3%. But the question we have to ask ourselves: is Seagate's capital returns plan realistic? Investors should consider two realities:I fear that Seagate may be a classic case of ""overpromise, underdeliver"" that may punish investors in the long run. Tread very carefully in this stock.It's no secret that Seagate's cash flows have suffered from slower fundamental performance since the pandemic began. In Q1 of this year, Seagate generated $186 million of free cash flow, down -40% y/y. Note that the cash flow headwind would have been worse had Seagate also not slashed down capital expenditures, which rivals like Western Digital have avoided in order to keep up with technological change.Figure 2. Seagate cash flow trendsSource: Seagate Q1 earnings deckIn Q2, meanwhile, Seagate paid out $157 million in dividends (under the old rate of $0.65/share), indicating a steep 84% payout ratio as a percentage of free cash flow. When you add in the $68 million in additional cash that Seagate spent to repurchase shares, Seagate actually paid out more in its capital returns program than it took in.Of course, a single quarter's cash flow may be subject to a variety of inflow/outflow timings and volatility that may not paint a realistic picture. But even when you look at Seagate's cash flow coverage from a trailing twelve-month basis, the picture still isn't very supportive:Again, over the trailing twelve months, Seagate's capital returns outlays have exceeded what the company has generated in free cash flow - and that's based on the preceding capital returns plans, before the 3% dividend bump and extended share repurchase authorization.Seagate's move to increase its shareholder returns while rivals are cutting back might be excusable if the company was able to provide real fundamental support that the business will swing back sharply in FY21. But so far, trends are far from strong. Here's a snapshot of how Seagate performed in Q1:Figure 3. Seagate Q1 highlightsSource: Seagate Q1 earnings deckSeagate's revenue in Q1 fell -10% y/y to $2.31 billion, missing Wall Street's hopes for $2.36 billion (08% y/y). At the same time, the company's pro forma gross margins also shed 20bps on a y/y basis and 80bps sequentially versus Q4.Seagate's management has expressed confidence that the company has hit its trough in Q1 and that FY21 will be stronger than FY20. Per CEO Dave Mosley's prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:Consensus is calling for revenue to decline -4% y/y and for EPS to decline -6% y/y in FY21. Management's outlook isn't entirely rosy, either. While CFO Gianluca Romano noted that he expects December quarter demand to be ""stable"" for consumer and enterprise HDD products, the company's richer-margin SSD business will still undergo a rocky recovery. Per Romano's remarks on the Q1 earnings call:Micron (MU), a memory vendor, noted in its most recent earnings call as well that enterprise demand was weak, with many customers carrying higher levels of inventory (stocking up at the beginning of the coronavirus) which will sap near-term orders. The key message here is that it's not perfectly clear that Seagate will see a V-shaped recovery in FY21 that would justify the company's more generous capital returns plan. With Seagate's dividend payments plus share buybacks over the trailing twelve months already exceeding FCF in the trailing twelve months, boosted capital returns amid expectations for flat/slightly down revenue and earnings in FY21 may mean that Seagate may have to take on more debt to finance its dividend.Figure 4. Seagate debt trendsSource: Seagate Q1 earnings deckSo far, as seen in the chart above, Seagate has managed to keep its nominal and net debt levels stable at ~$4.1 billion and ~$1.7 billion, respectively, while maintaining a ~2.2x leverage ratio based on trailing adjusted EBITDA. Investors should monitor Seagate's leverage closely to see if debt is the ""plug"" that Seagate uses to solve its conundrum.Don't be swayed by Seagate's generous dividend and buyback plans as a reason to buy the dip in this stock - as I've illustrated in this article, the company's plans to spend its cash may be overreaching relative to its actual profitability, while the fundamental backdrop remains uncertain. Seagate remains the only storage stock to have expanded its dividend plans, while rivals have retrenched their ambitions."
4370678,96726,2020-08-27T09:45:05-04:00,"Seagate is transitioning from the consumer market to focus mostly on enterprise sales.If you believe in data center investments from other firms, HDD's will power their development.HDDs remain cheaper to deploy and provide scalable storage growth for data centers.","Co-produced with Treading SoftlyHere at High Dividend Opportunities, we typically do not invest in the latest ""in vogue"" sector. We are immediate income investors with a strong value investing streak, all of which are guided by the principles within our Income Method. Today we want to look at a technology company that offers a compelling yield for its sector and a large potential for capital gains as well.Seagate Technology (STX) offers a current yield of 5.7% and is one of two major players in the HDD (Hard Disk Drive) space. For years it was directly competing with Western Digital (WDC) for supremacy.Recently both have lagged the market (SPY) in performance:WDC has clearly underperformed both STX and SPY in general. WDC also was cut from consideration as an ""income"" stock due to the suspension of its dividend in April.To understand STX's headwinds and direction, we need to take a moment to review a brief history of where they are coming from.STX was founded in 1979 and released its first product in 1980 - a 5mb HDD. Ever since then it has been a major player in the technology space. Usually, it's seen in direct competition with WDC. HDDs enjoyed a long life as the major successful way to store data, and as personal computing exploded globally, STX and WDC were the main places to get HDDs.Many of you will likely remember seeing STX HDDs for sale as a way to upgrade your PC's overall memory.Fast forward to today. The need for storage is everywhere. Cell phones, smartwatches, laptops, tablets, and an assortment of other devices all require data storage. The issue with these devices is they do not require HDD to operate. They use flash-based memory or SSD (solid-state drive) to function. This is not STX's cup of tea.To put it into perspective, HDD sales compose approximately 92% of total revenue this past quarter. The remaining 8% is broken down between SSD sales, Enterprise Data Solutions, and any other income STX produces.So STX saw the writing on the wall, the future of home computing was rapidly moving away from large stationary tower computers to small, faster devices that depend on the cloud for their larger storage and computing power.STX has shifted its focus from the consumer to enterprises to power the storage of the hub instead of the spokes. This shift meant building long-term relationships with service providers and cloud powerhouses. Microsoft (MSFT) uses STX devices in its cloud servers to provide storage solutions.STX has wisely started to ditch their focus on the consumer space. In most ""visions"" of the future of computing, the average person will need a nimble and quick device to access a stationary, large, and powerful server via the internet. A Chromebook by Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) works as a simple example of this. It's a fast booting, light device that runs on SSD for memory. It isn't designed for large storage or strong processing but relies on an Internet connection to be fully powered.Source: STX Earning Slides – Q4 FY20 (July 29)Quarter over quarter, STX has seen a steady rise in the revenue percent generated by its Mass Capacity – large HDDs sold to enterprise customers – vs its legacy consumer market. One shouldn't outright think that their legacy volumes are dropping, as they are actually growing slowly as well, however they are being outpaced by enterprise sales. The past two quarters saw significant headwinds from COVID-19 slowing sales and businesses reducing capital outlays on storage to preserve cash until uncertainty ends.A lot of hype has been made about NAND chip prices lowering. As a form of technology gets more established, the cost per gigabyte usually decreases. NAND is a type of SSD that is used in cellphones and other devices where power is not constantly present.NAND chip prices are lowering but their overall storage capacity is currently not up to the job that data centers need. HDD continues to see the growing ability for larger amounts of storage in the same dimensional space. STX's drives are essentially interchangeable, removing an older smaller-capacity drive and plugging in a more powerful one.STX has positioned itself in a rapidly-growing market. Data centers are rapidly being built.Source: DataCenter KnowledgeConsider this, your Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox (DBX) account, Amazon's (AMZN) AWS service, Netflix (NFLX), Facebook (FB), and the list goes on, all require massive amounts of stored data. As we shift to a more and more online-focused society, all that information needs to be housed. STX is selling massive amounts of storage to companies that are seeing rapidly rising demand.REITs also are seeing a focus on data centers – Iron Mountain (IRM) inked a deal for usage in June with increased storage to boot. Colony Capital (CLNY) is leading deals to develop more data centers in Europe and North America.STX is less worried about being on the shelf of your local Wal-Mart (WMT) or Best Buy (BBY) and more interested in providing the data storage they use to power their websites and data collection for their marketing.STX has shown the ability to keep paying its dividend while changing focus on enterprise sales. STX consistently is able to generate positive free cash flow. This is calculated by cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures prior to dividends and share buybacks.Source: STX Earning SlidesSTX in total for their FY2020 generated $1,129 million while paying out only $673 million in dividends. STX also repurchased $850 million worth of shares throughout their FY2020.STX has been committed to reducing their overall share count while maintaining strong dividend payments.The other concern is their debt balance. WDC stated they wanted to focus on paying down their debt before resuming dividends. STX has maintained the view that their debt is manageable.Objectively, I would agree that WDC needs to get their debt profile in better standing while also seeing that STX has a reasonable ratio of debt to EBITDA at this time.Source: STX Earning SlidesSTX's overall debt picture is well established. STX has a small term loan in fiscal year 2021, which we have just entered - and no notes to refinance until the next fiscal year.Source: FINRAThe bond market does not seem concerned about STX's ability to pay their debts either. Currently, all the bonds are trading above PAR value. Meanwhile, WDC does not share this positive outlook, with bonds trading slightly below PAR.STX is an island of value in an expensive technology market. STX currently trades at a forward price/earnings ratio of 10 times, and an enterprise value / EBITDA of 7.3 times. This is pretty cheap. Compare this to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for example, you get a Price/Earnings ratio of 75 times and an Enterprise Value / EBITDA of 56 times. You will find such grossly overvalued stocks like AMD across the Nasdaq Index (QQQ) including FAANG stocks. STX is truly a cheap stock given its outlook, balance sheet, and future earnings prospects.Investing in STX provides an alternative means to gain exposure to an explosive growth opportunity in technology. It does so while providing a dividend that is covered and occasionally has seen growth. Investors however should note that STX is a company in the midst of a transition. Over 50% of their revenue now comes from enterprise sales vs consumer legacy sales. This milestone is positive and important as this is their new focus.Continued share buybacks reduce the cost burden of their dividend and clears a path for it to continue to be paid moving forward. This mingled with the bond markets provides very strong evidence about the lack of investor concern over STX's ability to pay its debt or manage its maturities. Today, STX's 2034 bonds trades above par with a yield of 4.4%. The bond market is mostly comprised of banks and financial institutions and given this low bond yield for such a long maturity clearly provides good evidence that STX will not only pay its long-term debts, but will keep going strong for many years to come.Thanks for reading!

Over the past 3 months, Seagate has seen its share price decrease around 5.7% compared to an 18.3% rise in the S&P 500. The company is a name I have invested in before back in 2015-2016 when it was going through a cyclical profit swing and the opportunity looks to be presenting itself again. This article will take a look at Seagate's historic profitability and dividend coverage while also analyzing what free cash flows yields looks like.By focusing on its operational strengths in the hard disk drive memory market, Seagate has been able to achieve a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 24.2% since 2011. While cyclical along with the memory industry, Seagate has not had one unprofitable year in the past decade. This level of profitability is well above my rule of thumb of 9% ROIC, allowing me to be confident that, in my opinion, the company is able to maintain its intrinsic value over a business cycle.Source data from MorningstarSeagate does a great job of returning cash to shareholders. In their latest year ended June 2020, the company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. To get an idea of the sustainability of dividends and share repurchases, we can take a look at what percent of cash flow from operations is available to be returned to shareholders after making the necessary capital expenditures.As can be seen below, capital expenditures and acquisitions only used up on average 51% of cash flow from operations over the past decade. This leaves approximately 49% to be returned to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. With average cash flow from operations of $1.8 billion over the past five years, this 49% would imply free cash flow to shareholders of $0.9 billion for around a 7.7% free cash flow yield at the current $11.6 billion market capitalization.Source data from MorningstarAs this cash flow analysis would suggest, the dividend is well-covered. In terms as both earnings per share and free cash flow per share, Seagate's dividend payout ratio was only 68.1% and 60.5%, respectively, in the latest year. Source data from MorningstarFinancial leverage is extra important when considering an investment in a cyclical company. While Seagate's debt has increased over the past decade, the company still looks appropriately financed with an interest coverage ratio of 6.1x in the latest year.As mentioned previously in the discussions of cash flow, Seagate has also been repurchasing lots of shares. Since 2011, the company has lowered its amount of outstanding shares from 467 million to 265 million for an average annual share repurchases rate of 5.5%. When combined with the current dividend yield of 5.8%, this would indicate impressive total shareholder yields of around 11.3%.Seagate looks like a great value opportunity in an expensive market with a well-covered dividend yield of 5.8% and a trailing twelve-month P/E of only 12.0x.

The report was essentially a mixed bag. Revenue grew, but missed estimates. However, Seagate remains upbeat about the road ahead and points to mass capacity for what it can bring to the table. But there are signs that mass capacity may not be the savior it's touted to be. Why will be covered next.Q4 revenue increased by 6% YoY to $2.5B. Non-GAAP net income and EPS jumped by 17% and 26% to $311M and $1.20 respectively. In addition, EPS would have been higher by $0.25-0.30 if not for the impact of COVID-19, which resulted in lower revenue and higher costs. Likewise, gross margin of 27.3% would have been higher by 130 basis points if not for COVID-19.Source: Seagate Form 8-KEPS did get a boost from share buybacks, which amounted to $55M in Q4. About 1.1M shares were bought back to end the quarter with 168M shares outstanding. Note that in Q4 FY2019, Seagate recorded an income tax benefit of $692M, which throws off the YoY comparisons when it comes to GAAP.With Q4 done, so too has FY2020. FY2020 revenue increased by 1.1% to $10.5B. Non-GAAP net income and EPS declined by 11% and 4% to $1.3B and $4.95 respectively. The forecast sees Q1 FY2021 revenue at $2.1-2.5B, a decrease of 10.8% at the midpoint. EPS is seen at $0.70-1.00, a decrease of 17.5% at the midpoint.In many ways, the latest report is similar to earlier ones. They are a mixed bag with progress in some areas combined with regress in other areas. A previous article goes into further detail on this issue.Seagate provided further details in the earnings call as to the outlook for FY2021 and beyond. While demand is expected to improve in the next six months, FY2021 revenue is forecast to remain flat compared to FY2020. Mass capacity is expected to provide a lift by doubling in size over the next five years. From the Q4 earnings call:A transcript of the Q4 FY2020 earnings call can be found here.Seagate has high hopes when it comes to mass capacity and not without reason. Of the 117 exabytes of capacity shipped in the most recent quarter, mass capacity accounted for 91 exabytes with nearline shipments contributing 80 exabytes. It was just 52 exabytes a year ago.Demand for mass capacity is in turn enabled by data centers in an otherwise challenging business environment.Seagate also reiterated that its next-generation HAMR hard drives remain on track as scheduled. HAMR technology is needed to increase areal density so mass capacity can continue to grow.Lastly, although COVID-19 is expected to linger for a while, Seagate expects it to start to wane in the coming months.In a nutshell, mass capacity is what Seagate is focusing and betting on.There's no doubt that mass capacity growth has taken off, especially in FY2020. Mass capacity and the legacy part at Seagate have essentially traded places in recent years, which reflects the transformation Seagate is going through as can be seen in the table below.Source: Seagate 2020 Form 10-KMass capacity accounted for 53% of revenue in FY2020, an increase of 11 percentage points in two years' time. It used to be in the mid-twenties five years ago. In contrast, legacy has fallen by 12 percentage points to 39% during the same time frame. The amount of exabytes shipped rose from 202EB in FY2019 to 317EB in FY2020. A growth rate of over 50%, which is ahead of Seagate's goal of 35% CAGR.However, despite all the growth in mass capacity, top and bottom-line growth have yet to track along. Gross profit and EPS are all lower now than where they were two years ago, mass capacity growth notwithstanding. The primary reason for this seems to be persistent price erosion. The HDD price per terabyte or TB has fallen from $31 to $22 in two years' time.The HDD industry has historically dealt with price erosion, or price declines for data storage products with comparable capacity, performance and features. Price erosion usually get worse when supply exceeds demand, during recessions when competitors tend to lower prices to gain or keep market share and when there are few new products to offset competing products. Price erosion can be mitigated by introducing new products with higher capacity, better performance, enhanced feature sets and lower cost.Source: Wikimedia CommonsSeagate is a company going through a transition. The legacy part is under siege from competing products, usually featuring NAND flash memory chips. For instance, laptops that used to come with HDDs are now usually equipped with solid-state drives or SSDs. Many industry applications have turned away from HDDs, something that will obviously have an effect on suppliers like Seagate.Mass capacity is instead seen as the future of the company as there's still great demand for low-cost storage. Seagate has ramped up its shipments of mass capacity drives as indicated by the latest numbers for FY2020. But the massive increase has yet to benefit the bottom line in a meaningful way. Price erosion due to stiff competition from NAND seems to be the root cause.While HDDs continue to evolve, so too does NAND. The cost of NAND is decreasing, while maintaining its traditional advantages over HDDs such as speed, power consumption and so on. An argument can be made that NAND is evolving at a faster pace than HDDs. For instance, 64-96L 3D-NAND has been now succeeded by 128-144L 3D-NAND and mass production of 192L is expected in 2021. HDDs do not show similar progress.Competition from NAND could become even fiercer in the coming quarters if the price action for NAND chips is any indication. According to Trendforce, the price declines for NAND chips will accelerate into year end due to oversupply. This does not bode well for HDDs and their suppliers. Cheaper NAND will further intensify the move away from HDDs. Suppliers can lower their HDD prices to compete, but that leads to more price erosion.While HDDs retain the advantage in terms of cost, there may come a time when that's no longer the case assuming NAND continue on their current path. It's by no means certain that there will always be a market for mass capacity HDDs. Mass capacity at Seagate could start to resemble the legacy part of the company. Seagate has a lot riding on HAMR to fend off NAND. A previous article goes into further detail on this and other issues.I am neutral on Seagate. While the growth in mass capacity is encouraging, the price erosion is not. The mass capacity growth has served more to keep the competition at bay than to actually grow the bottom line. That could change down the road, but all signs indicate that will be difficult in the face of tough competition that looks set to become increasingly so over time."

Previously, Western Digital (WDC) offered investors a good dividend yield and good value. Now, Seagate offers investors a good balance of value and growth.Why should investors buy Seagate stock, especially when the stock, trading at around $47, barely fell from the $50-52 resistance level?Seagate posted record product sales, with earnings benefiting from strong cost discipline. It proactively managed its supply chain throughout the pandemic in China. Now, Seagate nearly fully recovered its supply chain operations, even in China, South Korea, and Taiwan. With increasing storage demand, Seagate stock may not fall further. At worst, it may re-test the $41 range should the stock market face any selling pressure. In the third quarter, Seagate’s revenue increased by 68% year on year.Strong demand from Hyperscale and cloud customers picked up pace near the end of the quarter. Although the company risks seeing a slower rate of sales in the current quarter, the surge in the remote economy might lead to sustained storage demands. The company said that,Below, nearline demand surged last quarter:Source: Seagate Q3/2020 presentationWeaker sales for video and image applications in Q3, due to lower surveillance and smart city implementations, will likely persist. Seagate may offset the uncertainty ahead when it ships its 18-terabyte product. This storage solution suits a hybrid environment. As the economy re-opens, the blend of remote and office work may give this segment a lift. Of course, talking about breaking up the coronavirus task force should alarm investors. The last thing the U.S. needs is the virus persisting in communities.Seagate generates strong cash flow last quarter. EPS rose 49% Y/Y to $1.38. The strong liquidity suggests that the company will maintain its dividend for the foreseeable future. But the company needs adoption of the private cloud and data at the edge driving long-term growth. On the balance sheet, Seagate held $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. It held $4.1 billion in gross debt and $2.5 billion in net debt.Seagate’s stock does not reflect the benefits of the reopening of China’s economy. Demand is already recovering in the region, which will help video and image application sales. Still, investors are cautious in expecting a quick rebound in the region. China’s lockdown ended, but it is still on high alert, and businesses are only experiencing a slow and gradual recovery.Seagate understandably withdrew its outlook for the second half of the year. This uncertainty limits the rebound potential on the stock. With a margin of safety of 34% and a fair value of $63.22, Seagate has a potentially high reward if business recovers sooner than thought.Data courtesy of DIY Value Investing at Stock RoverAs shown above, Seagate’s stock has a high score on value and quality. It scores a 49/100 on growth because of a forecast on revenue falling in the near term:Source: Stock Rover ResearchOn Wall Street, the average price target is ~$54 (per TipRanks) while based on future cash flow, the stock is worth ~$65.00.The pessimist should expect margin pressure due to COVID-19 adding to expenses and disrupting logistics. For example, suppliers would use airplanes to ship parts, increasing costs. Seagate may have to absorb some of those expenses to keep product costs from rising.A few years ago, I wrote that Western Digital looked like a better value play:Chart courtesy of Stock RoverFor a brief period, Western Digital outperformed Seagate. Now, the reverse is true. Seagate continues to reward investors with a dividend and has long-term growth prospects ahead. Edge computing, higher data consumption, and hybrid and private cloud trends will help Seagate grow."

Click here to find out more »One of the beaten down technology names that captures our interest during this market rout is Seagate Technologies (STX). This is primarily driven by its low peer comp multiples, hardware cycle refresh tied to next-generation consoles, and diminished supply chain exposure tied to the COVID-19 outbreak.Given the scope of recent market volatility, and the degree to which it has affected equities over the past several weeks, investors need to be more selective. We think a recovery tantamount to the 1987 stock market crash could create alpha or returns that are abnormal. But, when assuming a recovery, we don’t anticipate returns to be evenly distributed among equities, as investors are likely to pile back into equities that have an identifiable catalyst that adds growth/momentum to the underlying narrative that’s not priced in.We’re looking to invest into companies with a clearly identified catalyst that’s not priced into the stock. Of course, that’s a bit of a broad descriptor, but as we outline the impact from next-gen console hardware, which ties into the launch of Xbox Series X and (perhaps) PlayStation 5 in October, (which sits outside the timeframe by which COVID-19 disruption will likely impact the computing hardware supply chain in 1H’20). As such, we view the momentum tied to the launch of new console hardware to be a positive catalyst that could mitigate some of the supply chain disturbance in the storage/NAND segment. Not to mention, semiconductors tend to generate more revenue toward Q3’ or Q4’ of any given calendar year due to seasonality, so the near-term quarterly numbers are likely ugly, but also priced in.However, the back-half contribution from console builds definitely isn’t priced in, and when taking into consideration Seagate’s already generous P/E multiple of 6.9x versus average semiconductor computer hardware P/E multiples of 17.61x, the stock is already trading at a substantial discount. Currently, Seagate trades at $46 per share, but we think there's significant upside tied to its valuation. For example, Intel trades at 10.61x earnings, Western Digital trades at 29.57x earnings. The average storage device industry's P/E multiple is 11.11x earnings. Therefore if Seagate reports in-line earnings of $5.05 for the current fiscal year, and the stock trades at 11.11x earnings the stock should eventually trade at $56.10 implying +22% upside. Keep in mind, this is a realistic scenario, and when valuations reflate across the computer hardware sector, the companies that are likely to outperform post market crash are the equities with implied revenue/earnings upside that’s not priced in. Therefore, we’re looking to buy some more Seagate shares in the near-term.Trademarks Property of Microsoft & Sony EntertainmentIt’s anticipated that both the Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5 will come with an 1TB SSD and 825GB SSD, but what’s not commonly known is the hardware supplier (Seagate) for its exclusive external drive. Microsoft (MSFT) went with a custom Seagate SSD for its expandable storage. This is unlike AMD (AMD) where everyone already anticipates the impact from console hardware refresh to be inclusive of AMD parts and would be more comparative to prior console cycle impact. However, there’s very little news/financial coverage when pertaining to the SSD storage, or the supplier behind the next-gen Xbox and PlayStation, which is what makes us more excited.Given the outsized dependency on HDDs (hard disk drives) in the prior console cycle, the transition to flash storage creates an outsized impact on performance, which can be witnessed here via a Microsoft tech demo involving a YouTube influencer.Based on the teardown/preview the justification for flash storage is driven by:In terms of PlayStation 5 preview, there’s not as much information, so we’re anticipating Sony (SNE) to make a major announcement at E3 2020 (assuming the event isn’t cancelled due to COVID-19). This will provide gamers & investors more details on Sony’s proprietary storage. However, the news tied to Sony’s upcoming storage indicates that Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) will be the next major supplier, which makes sense as there were patent filings indicating that Sony had developed cartridge storage, thus requiring a custom design.When there’s a custom design involved it implies the need for a fab to manufacture the custom SSD, which by necessity requires access to Samsung’s fabs, as it remains the world’s largest supplier of memory/flash storage thus having ample capacity. Therefore, we think the rumors tied to Sony and Samsung check out, because Sony still needs to take its custom design to a fab, and secondly Samsung’s announcement of custom storage for next-gen gaming hardware kind of just gave it away.Sony revealed that its upcoming storage would operate on a PCIE 4.0 interface with data transfer speeds of 5.5 GB/s. Similarly, Samsung unveiled an PCIE 4.0 interface for storage via its CES 2020 introduction making it the first-gen counterpart from its prior PCIE 3.0 interface. Samsung also unveiled data read/write speeds that average 5.75 GB/s which is comparable to the data transfer rates Sony unveiled at a recent tech briefing.The inclusion into console hardware is less impactful financially, as Samsung’s revenue base is far more significant and broadly diversified with smartphone’s and displays creating more moving assumptions. Not to mention, Samsung already has disproportionate share in the NAND and Memory segment with Samsung dominating 35% of the NAND flash market as of Q4’19, according to Statista. So, it doesn’t move the needle as much when compared to Seagate Technologies (where Seagate generated 92% of its revenue from HDDs last quarter).However, Western Digital (WDC) was the supplier for the PlayStation 4, and the absence of Western Digital in PlayStation 5 could prove to be a headwind. Of course, we could be wrong, but there’s little reasoning to suggest Sony went with a Western Digital SSD in its upcoming console.Therefore, we’re primarily focusing on the opportunity from the frame of Xbox Series X revenue contribution to Seagate Technologies.The implied upside for Seagate from the Xbox Series X is anticipated to be significant. Mainly because of the custom expandable storage CF Express cards that Seagate has developed for expandable storage for Xbox Series X. This custom storage expansion is impactful, as it’s anticipated that it will be the only expandable storage option for Xbox gamers for Microsoft’s upcoming console.Trademarks Property of Microsoft and Seagate TechnologiesWedbush Analyst Matthew Bryson estimates that the CF Express Cards will be built in volume to the tune of 1 to 2 million units with an average price point of $100. Whereas custom storage won’t be necessary for the PS5, hence the peripheral opportunity is more distributed among other NAND makers.This implies $100M to $200M revenue impact from the launch of Xbox Series X where Seagate’s Enterprise Data Solutions and SSD business generated revenue of $771M revenue in FY’19. Therefore, the inclusion at the mid-point of $150M revenue for its much smaller SSD/Enterprise data business is actually significant because it could drive revenue growth of +19.4% for the segment assuming organic growth remains constant for its other product lines.Furthermore, it signals that Seagate can still compete for market share despite its overwhelming dependency on mass storage via its HDD business where it generated $9.6B revenue in FY’19. The HDD business mainly survives because of the need for cheap storage in data centers whereas the consumer business has mostly shifted away from HDDs in favor of either flash or NAND based storage.Hence, the outlook for its core business remained mostly stable, as they announced the release of 16TB HDDs for enterprise applications such as network attached storage (NAS), mass capacity storage, and etc. While, expectations tied to COVID-19 impact was mostly contained to a widened revenue guidance range it doesn’t seem as significant of a headwind, but the markets have priced-in much more financial impact tied to the recent supply chain distributions tied to Coronavirus.According to Gianluca Romano (CFO of Seagate):Therefore in an absolute worst-case scenario assuming the guidance still applies, Seagate may report revenue of $2.51 billion in Q3’19, which still suggests y/y revenue growth from prior year comps. The company reported revenue of $2.3 billion in Q3’19, which suggests that if Seagate has managed to keep the impact to its supply chain more limited, and is able to report at even the low-end of the revenue guidance range – revenue is anticipated to grow by +9.1% in the upcoming quarter.Well, the downside to our thesis ties into the length of the COVID-19 outbreak and how disruptive it could be for the computer hardware supply chain. Expectations could shift to the downside if management's revenue guidance proves to be too optimistic, or the scope of the virus impact becomes more disruptive than what analyst consensus expects. There's a lot of uncertainty tied to the length of impact in the United States, and so as a consequence our thesis would be negatively impacted if business activity is affected for 6-9 months.While, we remain optimistic on the transitional narrative. There's also the fact that Seagate's SSD business is nascent, and could fall further behind peers in terms of technical roadmap. Developing cutting edge flash memory is capital intensive so maintaining attractive margins while developing technical continuity in its storage business could prove difficult.The company is making inroads to shift more revenue contribution to its nascent SSD business, which investors have mostly ignored, but there’s actually signs of life tied to their efforts given the impact of upcoming game consoles. In fact, we think Seagate trades at a discount when compared to peers due to its technology roadmap, and its dependency on HDDs versus SSDs. But, given the on-going transition into SSDs, and the need for cheap HDDs in datacenters we think investors have overly discounted the growth prospects of the company.What’s more important isn’t the absolute dollar contribution of Xbox Series X, but the fact that Seagate is doing something to generate more expectations tied to its SSD business. Meaning that even if HDDs are considered a legacy business and could struggle to sustain revenues/margins due to tech obsolescence given enough years… the management team still seems to be doing a good enough of a job harvesting its core IP in HDDs while gradually ramping-up expectations tied to SSDs. When Seagate generates more notable revenue contribution from SSDs the doomsday scenario will likely abate thus shifting shareholders expectations to a less dire scenario, as the company returns to a more normalized valuation comparable to hardware peers in the technology space.Therefore, we’re excited by the recent market rout, as we’re in a unique position to pick-up an already cheap stock at an even cheaper price without hardly any expectations tied to a transition into the SSD business where there are signs of enough progress to keep us excited. In other words, it’s not a value trap, but rather a re-emerging growth narrative that investors have mostly ignored thus creating an attractive investment opportunity."
4358718,104099,2020-07-15T20:06:00-04:00,"I think Seagate Technology is a very well-run, shareholder-friendly company. I think the stock represents great value at current prices.I think the dividend is very well-covered, which makes this high-yielding stock quite compelling in my view.For those who are nervous, I recommend selling put options here. This trade has worked well in the past and I think repeating success is never a bad strategy.","If I were to start this article by writing ""I don't mean to brag, but...,"" that'd be a lie. I do plan to brag. The act of stating that you don't want to do something, and then going ahead and doing that thing strongly suggests that the first part of the sentence is just a way to make you look less personally odious. People who know me well understand on a deep level that I have no problem embracing my inner odiousness, so here goes. I've done well with my investments in Seagate Technology (STX). In late November of 2018, I wrote the first of two articles on Seagate. It was bullish, hence the very imaginative title ""Buy Seagate Technologies"" and investors earned a return of ~21% subsequent to that, as compared to a 14% return for the S&P 500 over the same time period. I then shifted to neutral and wrote in November of 2019 that I'd be selling my shares. Subsequent to that, the shares lost 15.6% against a gain of 2% for the S&P 500.Today, I'll endanger my record here and offer another commentary about whether it makes sense to buy back in again. I'll try to make that determination by looking at both the financial history here and the stock itself. I'll also recommend another options trade, as the last one I recommended worked out rather well in my estimation. For those who can't stand my writing, and who somehow missed the title of this article, I'll come right to the point. I think shares of Seagate represent great value at current levels. I think investors would be wise to buy.The financial history here is impressive in my view. Although it's been cyclical, obviously, over the past six years, profits have increased at a CAGR of about 4%, in spite of the fact that revenue has declined at a CAGR of about 4.5% over the same time period. Additionally, management has treated shareholders fairly well, as evidenced by the fact that they've grown dividends per share at a CAGR of about 7% since 2014. I think the dividend is obviously important to investors, so I want to concentrate here on whether the dividend is safe or not. In my view, if the dividend is secure, the shares will likely do well, and the reverse if the dividend is in doubt.Dividend sustainability is all about cash in my view. For that reason, I want to review the size and timing of future outflows of cash, and compare them to likely current and future sources of cash. The greater the spread between these, the better, obviously. In keeping with my obsession about making your lives easier, dear readers, I've compiled a list of upcoming cash outflows. Please note that the 2020 CAPEX figure comes right from the latest 10-K, and the $467 figure is an average of the last three years of PP&E investments. Obviously, this is an imprecise measure and my goal is to try to understand what future year will be the most onerous on a cash flow basis. Based on the table, I think 2022 and 2023 will be particularly expensive for the company.Source: Latest 10-KAgainst those future obligations, the company has just over $1.6 billion of cash on hand. In addition, the company has generated an annual average of just over $1.93 billion in cash from operations since 2017. This suggests to me that the dividend is quite safe, and that I'd be very comfortable buying these shares if, to borrow the tagline of a timeless game-show, the price is right.Source: Company filingsFor better or worse, most investors can't simply buy the future cash flows of a given business. We invest in companies via stocks that trade in a public market, and stocks are often a poor proxy for the fortunes of a given company, and they move up and down in price based on factors unrelated to the underlying company. For instance, stock markets are affected by the actions of central bankers. Additionally, institutional investors might affect stock prices generally when they determine that ""stocks"" are more or less appealing than some other asset class. This suggests to me that I need to write about the stock itself as a thing distinct from the underlying business.When I look at a stock, I want to try to determine the risk vs. reward of the investment, and I think cheaper stocks have both lower risk and higher return potentials than more expensive stocks. In my view, cheaper stocks have lower risk because negative news is, to some extent, already ""priced in;"" so negative news won't drive share prices much lower. They have potentially higher return because when cheap stocks post surprisingly good results, shares tend to spike upwards in price.I judge whether a stock is cheap or not in a few ways, ranging from the more simple to the more complex. On the simple side, I look at the ratio of price to some measure of economic value, like earnings, free cash flow, and the like. The less an investor needs to pay for $1 of future value, the better in my estimation. In particular, I want to see a stock trading at a discount relative to both the overall market and to its own history. When I first wrote about Seagate, I made much of the fact that it was trading at a price to free cash flow of ~9 times. I became far less sanguine later when the shares were trading at a price to free cash flow of about 15.5 times. At the moment, the shares are closer to the lower band, per the following:Data by YChartsWhile I will be buying these shares at current prices, I can understand that an investor might be nervous about joining me because this is a particularly strange time in market history. Valuations generally remain lofty in the teeth of a global recession. In my view, an investor could be forgiven for wanting to wait for a more attractive entry price. There are two problems with waiting, though. First, there's no reason to suppose that shares will continue to fall in price, as the dividends act as a sort of support for shares. Second, if the shares do drop in price, there's no reason to suppose that the investor will take advantage of the drop and buy. Typically, shares will drop in price for reasons that seem immediately plausible. The platitude ""buy low"" is barely helpful in the context of a large drop in price that seems to make a great deal of sense. This is why so many investors, myself among them, look back longingly at massive price drops, wishing they bought and not sat on the sidelines. The fact is that humans are social animals who are very much influenced by each other, and it's hard to buy when others are panicked.I think short put options represent a great compromise for an investor who likes this business, but is nervous about buying at the current price. The short put generates an immediate premium, which satisfies the human need to ""do something."" Additionally, the short put acts as a sort of Ulysses Pact (Ulysses pact), in that it can in some sense ""force"" the investor to buy at an advantageous price at a time when they may not want to. In an emotionally ""cold"" state, the investor decides that buying a given asset at a given price will lead to great long-term returns. The short put facilitates this by offering a compulsion to buy that asset at that price, no matter what the then current mood is. This is why I am such a fan of short puts, and I think my own experiences with Seagate validates this view somewhat.In my previous missive on Seagate, I suggested that investors sell the June 2020 puts with a strike of $45. At the time, the bid-asked spread on those was $1.60-1.63. Although I didn't happen to be exercised on these, there was a chance that I would be as Seagate dropped well below the strike price this past March, obviously. Had I been exercised, I would be sitting on a 9% capital gain in the space of a few months, which would have been good. As it stands, I'll have to console myself in collecting the premium on seven of these puts, which is a fairly decent consolation prize in my estimation.I like to repeat success when I can, so I'm recommending selling another batch of Seagate puts. At the moment, my preferred options to sell are the January 2021 Seagate puts with a strike of $40. These are currently bid-asked at $2.29-3.15, and they represent a ""win-win"" trade in my estimation. If the shares remain above the strike price, the investor will simply pocket the premium and drive on, which is obviously a win. If the shares drop in price, and the shares are ""put"" to the investor, they will be obliged to buy, but they'll do so at a price that represents a great entry price. If the investor simply takes the bid on these, and is subsequently exercised, they'll buy this great company at a net price of about $37.70. This corresponds to a dividend yield of just under 7%, and a price to free cash flow of just over 9. Please remember that that ratio is what got me excited about this company in the first place, so I think $37.70 would be a great entry price for this business.I hope you're excited about the prospects of a ""win-win"" trade, dear reader, because it's time for me to significantly damage your optimism by writing about risk. The nature of the world is such that we humans must choose between a host of imperfect trade-offs. There is no ""risk-free"" option, and short puts are no different in this regard. We do our best to navigate the world by exchanging one pair of risk-reward trade-offs for another. For example, holding cash presents the risk of erosion of purchasing power via inflation and the reward of preserving capital at times of extreme volatility. Unless you're just joining us, the risk-reward trade-off of buying shares is self-evident, especially in 2020.I think the risks of put options are very similar to those associated with a long stock position. If the shares drop in price, the stockholder loses money, and the short put writer may be obliged to buy the stock. Thus, both long stock and short put investors typically want to see higher stock prices.Puts are distinct from stocks in that some put writers don't want to actually buy the stock - they simply want to collect premia. Such investors care more about maximizing their income and will, therefore, be less discriminating about which stock they sell puts on. These people don't want to own the underlying security. I like my sleep far too much to play short puts in this way. I'm only willing to sell puts on companies I'm willing to buy at prices I'm willing to pay. For that reason, being exercised isn't the hardship for me that it might be for many other put writers. My advice is that if you are considering this strategy yourself, you would be wise to only ever write puts on companies you'd be happy to own.In my view, put writers take on risk, but they take on less risk (sometimes significantly less risk) than stock buyers in a critical way. Short put writers generate income simply for taking on the obligation to buy a business that they like at a price that they find attractive. This circumstance is objectively better than simply taking the prevailing market price. This is why I consider the risks of selling puts on a given day to be far lower than the risks associated with simply buying the stock on that day.I'll conclude this rather long discussion of risks by indulging my tendency toward tedious repetition, and I'll use the trade I'm currently recommending as an example. An investor can choose to buy Seagate today at a price of ~$47.40. Alternatively, they can generate a credit for their accounts immediately by selling put options that oblige them - under the worst possible circumstance - to buy the shares at a net price 20% below today's level. Buying the same asset at a one-fifth discount is the definition of lower risk, in my view.I think this is a very well-run, shareholder-friendly firm, and I think the stock is trading very near a reasonable price at the moment. Most importantly, in my view, the dividend is sustainable, and I think there's room for further increases down the road. That said, I can understand why some investors are either still shellshocked from the recent market tumult or they're nervous about sudden recovery of stock prices in the face of a recession. For such people, I think short put options offer a lower risk way to ""play"" this business. For my part, I'm both buying back in and selling the puts described above over the next day or two."
4338672,105622,2020-04-20T21:47:45-04:00,SSD is narrowing HDDs pricing power and technology is rapidly improving.Seagate has been losing legacy revenue and enterprise segments aren't rising quick enough to compensate.The firm lacks recourses and expertise to compete in the SSD market.Stock has an obscene P/B ratio and is overvalued.,"Seagate Technologies (STX) is a leader in the hard disk drive (HDD) market, controlling north of 40% of the global HDD business. However, that’s where Seagate’s advantages end. The company only excels in one market, and as the global storage market continues to move towards NAND flash storage, Seagate and its HDD saturated portfolio will be left behind. The Company's business model isn’t viable into the future, and the stock is a poor long term investment.(Source: Enterprise Storage Forum)While HDD remains a viable solution for high volume data storage due to its lower price over SSD, SSD has made more inroads in recent years. While SSDs are pricier per GB than HDDs, SSDs still have significant advantages that lower ownership costs over time such as improved performance, speed, lower power consumption, increased durability due to no moving parts, and smaller size. Some of these advantages balance out the initial HDD cost advantage and make SSDs cheaper over time, which is why HDDs for PCs are becoming obsolete. In 2019, north of 60% of computers were sold with SSDs, up from 6% in 2012. This discrepancy is expected only to grow as SSD are cheaper to own long term in smaller capacities. Seagate has attempted to offset declines in the legacy HDD market by spending considerably on new HDD technology like helium drives and heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). At this point, HDDs still boast larger storage capacities at lower price points. However, the persisting advancement of NAND flash storage technology is closing the price and performance gap exponentially quickly. Just like it has in the legacy market, SSD’s will eventually begin to pull sizable market share away from HDD in enterprise storage markets.Sales of legacy products, such as PC’s and external drives which have made up a majority of Seagate’s revenue in the past, continue to decline sharply. Though Seagate has begun to orient its business more around high volume enterprise storage with nearline demands increasing short term, energy efficiency concerns within data centers and hyperscale cloud players with HDD technology could evaporate this opportunity. Legacy products like PCs still account for nearly half (43%) of revenue, although this segment is rapidly declining (made up 53% in 1Q18). This decline will continue as the firm faces two headwinds in PC storage—the rapid rise in popularity of SSD and the general decline in PC unit sales.While Seagate has been able to keep revenue growth idle as they attempt to pull more of the enterprise market, the firm stands to lose out on the legacy market in totality with no sizable SSD offering. Although sales in mass capacity grew by 25% YoY due to increased nearline and surveillance demand, SSD continues to pick up steam in the mission critical enterprise space, as sales in that category were down 19% YoY. Although the rapid rise in data center storage needs has helped the firm capitalize in the nearline enterprise market, the broader market has begun to shift from hard disk drives spinning at 10K to 15K rpm to faster access SSDs.(Source: STX 1Q20 10-Q)Seagate does not have a foothold in the SSD market and HDD makes up nearly all of their sakes. While Seagate does offer some SSD storage, in 1Q20 HDD’s made up 92% of their total revenue. SSD made up less than 5% and does not remain a segment of high importance at the firm. Instead of attempting to innovate the offerings and move more aggressively into the SSD market, Seagate has strived to spend considerably on new HDD technology that is headed towards obsoletion. Seagate has been slow to make the move into SSD in general, leaving them competitively weak against peers like Western Digital (WDC), who has expanded their SSD market share from near zero to ~16% due to its acquisition of SanDisk for ~$19 billion and other aggressive moves. Although Seagate has an agreement with Toshiba to supply a reliable source of NAND flash storage, in the broader scheme of the market it is quite insignificant as Seagate makes up a meager 0.2% of the SSD market. In addition, while the company has intangible advantages in the HDD field like design expertise and cost advantage in manufacturing, they don’t have such advantages in the SSD field which is ultra-competitive with Intel (INTC), Samsung (KRX: 005930), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Micron (MU) all commanding sizable stakes, and many others competing as well. Seagate has a limited opportunity for expansion in the SSD market considering the crowded field and their indifferentiable offerings, and they lack the cash and expertise of the other firms who do billions in flash storage sales annually. Shares look overvalued based on two valuation metrics. The stock trades at an ultra-expensive price/book ratio of 7.26, much higher than the industry average of 2.3. This is in part due to the firm's sizable debt and small cash position. While the stock trades on a cheap P/E multiple of 9.5 compared to the industry average of 16, Seagate hasn’t shown the type of revenue growth its peers have in the past few years so a low multiple is warranted. The firm has posted negative YoY revenue growth for the past 6 quarters, and the total HDD storage market is shrinking, narrowing the pathways for meaningful revenue growth.Furthermore, the company has liabilities of $2.70b due within 12 months, and liabilities of $4.40b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of $1.75b and $1.11b worth of receivables due within a year. Its liabilities total $4.24b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables. In a terrible macro environment with poor short term revenue growth history, Seagate could be forced to roll over some of its debt with unideal terms as corporate bond markets are currently oversaturated. The firm also commands a poor debt to equity ratio of 2.26 compared to the sector average of .2. While some could argue that Seagate is rather conservatively geared due to its net debt sitting at just 1.5 times EBITDA, Seagate’s future earnings growth will be imperative for its debt levels, as well as avoiding a repeat of the 37% cut to EBIT over the last year. Instead of working towards more strategic growth in the SSD market which will be imperative for future revenue growth, Seagate has instead worked to starve off the switch for as long as possible by spending considerably on new HDD technology. This strategy will backfire on the firm as SSD continues to drive down HDD sales. While current uncertainty makes it impossible to make short term forecasts on shares, I do believe the stock will trend lower in the long run as Seagate’s core business continues to lose ground."
4369433,105308,2020-08-18T08:10:10-04:00,"Due to its historical capital return policy, we find Seagate investable despite its cyclical sector of operations.Several risks remain, driven by an inconsistent sector with heavy competition.Despite the stock's potential to deliver adequate returns, we don't find enough potential to buy into Seagate.However, Seagate could be a decent pick for sector exposure with a relatively safe 5.5% yield.","We are usually looking for companies that generate consistent cash flows to be able to predict their potential returns more accurately. As a result, we avoid cyclical stocks whose sales can fluctuate wildly based on macroeconomic events, such as companies that produce semiconductors.However, some stocks in the computer hardware sector offer considerable tangible returns, and trade at an attractive valuation, which could result in investable opportunities. One such stock is Seagate Technologies (STX), which offers data storage products and data storage solutions. Despite its cyclical business model, the company has built a relatively solid dividend record over the past decade. With shares yielding a considerable 5.77% attached to a P/E at the low teens, let's assess whether Seagate is worth investing in.In this article, we will:Our core thesis on why Seagate could be an investable opportunity is because its shareholder return policy has allowed for relatively consistent returns, despite the company's cyclical business model. Over the past decade, the company has been consistently paying quarterly dividends, which have been growing when possible.Source: Seeking AlphaManagement has been prudent with the company's dividend policy. As we mentioned, Seagate's profitability can see significant fluctuations. Despite DPS being stable over the past few years, the payout ratio reached worrying levels in 2016. We believe this is a thoughtful strategy by management since DPS should remain relatively covered if another EPS decay occurs.Source: Seeking AlphaCoupled with the dividend, the company delivers further tangible returns through its stock repurchase programs. We believe this is an excellent way to return capital to shareholders for three reasons:Management is well aware of the advantages of buying back shares at Seagate's low valuation levels. Over the past 15 years, the company has retired a mind-boggling 55% of its total shares outstanding.To illustrate our second bullet point, Seagate's last-twelve-month (LTM) EPS is currently near its 2016 levels, despite revenues having declined by nearly 30% since. As a result, Seagate's dividend has remained relatively safe, with the current payout ratio at around 57%, despite the recent earnings decline. To summarise, we like Seagate's tangible returns. The 5.77% could provide a considerable income, while the consistent stock repurchase is a great way to drive shareholder value at current valuation levels while keeping the payout ratio at a safe 57%.On the other hand, there are numerous risks to watch out for, if one were to invest in the stock.While we believe Seagate has a few investable characteristics when it comes to shareholder returns, there are also several risks to consider.Firstly, the HDD price per terabyte has been consistently falling. From $31 in 2018, the price has fallen by nearly 1/3 in just two years. This makes sense. I remember buying an 8GB flash drive for $30 around ten years ago. Today, you can apparently get a Terrabyte for fewer dollars. The potential risk is that Seagate has to offer higher storage units to cope with storage economics consistently. Failing to increase its products' capacity will drive its revenues significantly lower.Source: 10-KFurther, the company is under massive competition in the disk drive and SSD market by global behemoths such as Micron Technology (MU), Inc., Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF), Inc., Toshiba Corporation (OTCPK:TOSBF), and Western Digital (WDC). Coupled with such steep competition, Seagate must consistently maintain time-to-market performance with its new products while being able to produce at profitable volumes, with adequate quality and costs.The combination of competition, and cyclical demand, keep gross margins compressed across the sector. As the graph illustrates, Western Digital is able to achieve similar margins. No company in the data storage tech space can enjoy higher margins, since massive competition keeps the pricing points on a long-term decline, as mentioned earlier.While this may be optimal for consumers, as economics 101 has taught us, Seagate is doomed to operate in a low-margin sector. If the demand for its products deteriorates, there is little room for profitability, which could set the dividend in danger, similar to 2016, as shown earlier.Overall, Seagate operates in a stressful business environment, driven by fluctuating sales, macroeconomic events, compressed margins due to severe competition, and constant cost management. Many investors could find the company's operations frustrating to keep up with, despite management attempting to returning considerable amounts of capital.As we showed earlier, EPS levels have lagged over the past decade, due to reduced revenues. The company guided for Q1-2021 EPS of $0.85, which suggests an increase of 13.3% compared to Q1-2020.Source: Company filings, AuthorHowever, analysts have more prudent estimates with FY2021 EPS at $4.54. The company bought back a substantial 6.5% of its shares outstanding over the past 12 months. To be prudent, we are going to estimate that EPS grows by an annualized 5% in the medium term, to factor in the potential for reduced demand and margin compression. We assume that earnings remain relatively stable, with most of EPS growth coming in from stock buybacks.Also, we assume stable DPS with no growth to maintain a healthy payout ratio, in line with the relatively stable DPS of the past five years.Despite the cyclical financials and risks involved, Seagate's attractive valuation could potentially result in attractive returns. Shares are currently trading at ten times forward earnings as per analyst estimates. As you can see, even if the company were to retain its current valuation, investors are looking at a double-digit return potential with dividends reinvested.Source: AuthorDespite our low expected EPS growth and stable distributions, the combination of stock buybacks and dividend re-investments can drive substantial returns in the medium term. A valuation expansion towards the low teens would further accelerate returns, but we consider this unlikely, based on the risks involved.Seagate's cyclical sector of operations is not our preference. The company's stable dividend and massive stock buybacks, coupled with a low valuation, drove our interest to assess if the stock offers a considerable return potential.However, the low valuation is not for no reason, as there are several risks involved. The company's sales are subject to macroeconomic events and the CAPEX of big corporations, which could cut expenditure under a COVID-19 reignition. Along with the heavy competition, margins have little room to grow, and could easily lead to losses amid the lack of demand.Assuming relatively prudent estimates, modest EPS growth driven by buybacks and a stable DPS could indeed point to double-digit annualized returns. However, the return potential is hardly enough to compensate us for the risks involved, in our view. Considering that we have covered several companies that offer both stable cash flows with a similar return potential, we view no reason to cope with Seagate's rather inconsistent performance, despite its attractive valuation.Our preferences aside, though, we believe that the stock offers a relatively safe high dividend yield. Shares could appear to be an optimal pick for those who want exposure in the data storage tech sector while enjoying a decent income along the way."
4340194,105526,2020-04-27T10:10:44-04:00,"Seagate's FQ3 results were broadly encouraging as hyperscale demand helped offset legacy HDD declines.The dividend has been raised slightly, bringing the yield to 5%.The yield is well-supported, but shares trade at a notable premium to its closest peer, WDC, keeping me on hold.","Seagate's (NASDAQ:STX) encouraging FQ3 results should afford bulls with increased optimism that nearline demand will hold up throughout the year, though the full impact of COVID-19 across the supply chain remains broadly unclear at this point. Thus, though bulls will point to the strength in nearline exabyte shipments, there is a material risk of a significant IT spending slowdown later in the year as data center demand aligns with inventory levels. Importantly, valuations seem pricey at 10x forward P/E, which represents a hefty premium to its closest peer, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).On balance, the fact that Seagate hit its original March quarter guidance despite supply and demand disruptions from COVID-19 was encouraging. June quarter guidance was also resilient, with bullish demand commentary for the second half of the year largely attributable to Seagate's growing cloud mix. For the FQ3 quarter, STX reported revenue of $2.72B (+18% Y/Y and above consensus of $2.6bn), with non-GAAP EPS at $1.38 (above consensus of $1.30). A snapshot of Seagate's key metrics for the quarter is as follows:Source: Investor PresentationOf note, Seagate's non-GAAP gross margin of 28.0% suffered from 100bp of negative impact due to COVID-19, driving a 70bps QoQ decline, despite an 800bps improvement in the higher-margin Mass Capacity revenue mix. According to management on the FQ3 call, the 100bps margin impact came not only from elevated freight costs related to COVID-19 but also lower utilization at the non-HDD Systems business, which was negatively impacted by ODM supply constraints.Non-GAAP opex also rose 2% YoY to $340m, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 15.5% (+3.3%pts YoY). Cash flow from operations was down 14% YoY to $390m, driving FCF to $260m (-16% YoY).Source: Investor PresentationLooking ahead, STX is guiding toward revenue of $2.6B (+/- 7%) and non-GAAP EPS of $1.15-1.41, on similar demand trends for global cloud and hyperscale customers in FQ4. The COVID-19 impact is also guided to be modestly higher for the June quarter, mainly a result of anticipated manufacturing disruptions across the supply chain. Nonetheless, STX's long-term financial goals remain unchanged despite COVID-19, implying a long-term outlook of +2-6% sales growth, 13-16% operating margins, 6-8% in CapEx/sales, and over 50% of free cash flow returned to shareholders.Source: Analyst Day 2019 PresentationThe ongoing shift to remote work has served as a massive tailwind to Seagate's hyperscale business, as accelerated applications in the public cloud drove nearline exabyte shipments to rise 155% YoY. If management's guide for continued strength into F4Q is anything to go by, this trend could hold up for the rest of the year, with full-year mass capacity EB growth guided to exceed the long-term CAGR of 35-40%. Seagate has cumulatively shipped 3M 16TB drives, relative to ~1m in shipments in the December quarter, with shipments of 18TB also set to commence in limited qualities.Source: Investor PresentationThe legacy side of the business remains a drag, however, as revenue declined 19% YoY. While some of this is seasonal (the March quarter is typically a seasonally weak quarter), weaker-than-expected trends in desktop PCs and consumer electronics also contributed. This likely indicates a preference for SSDs by customers to support working from home.Source: Company DataMeanwhile, uncertainty on both the supply and demand outlook remains elevated. On the demand side, for instance, a portion of the demand strength could be attributable to inventory build at its customers (though management does not believe this to be the case). Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), for instance, recently pointed to bigger on-hand inventory builds as a mitigation scenario amid ongoing supply chain disruptions, according to DataCenterKnowledge.From a supply perspective, STX expects improvements throughout the supply chain in F4Q, though there will likely still be some supply-related impact due to COVID-19.On a positive note, Seagate is not short of cash. Despite investor concerns around secular declines in the legacy business, the company has continued to drive strong earnings growth, with $3.1bn of liquidity on hand ($1.6bn of cash and $1.5bn available from the revolver). Thus, I see ample cushion for the company to continue returning at least 50% of its FCF to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Thus far, the company has spent $195m on stock repurchases in FQ3, equivalent to 99% of FCF over the last 12 months, and has raised the quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share (equivalent to a 5% annual dividend yield).Source: Company DataWhile the planned capital return is compelling, the current Seagate multiple at 10x P/E seems elevated, especially considering shares typically command a similar multiple in anticipation of an upcycle.Data by YChartsInstead, I think a 7-8x multiple (in line with historical levels) might be more appropriate, given the risk of a peaking HDD cycle, as well as NAND pricing. In sum, Seagate's quarter and guide signal a decidedly positive outlook, but I think we could see the cycle turn if nearline demand slows as data center inventory aligns with end-market demand. Sustained demand strength for HDDs and slower cannibalization by SSDs would be primary upside risks to my view, while a prolonged slowdown in cloud infrastructure spend and faster cannibalization by SSDs would drive further downside."
4353111,82056,2020-06-10T13:55:35-04:00,STX has been buying back its own shares every year for the last 11 years.STX has increased its dividend from .18 to 2.56 over the last 10 years.Revenue has gone up every quarter for the last 5 quarters.Even though everything looks good the stock price is down.,"Note: This article was posted for my subscribers on May 11, 2020. Seagate (STX) closed at $49.86 on May 11, 2020.Seagate Technolgy (STX) is one of the largest hard drive manufacturers in the world. They are well known for driving HDD (Hard Disk Drive) technology to higher and higher capacity and speed. Many thought HDDs would be obsolete by now since Seagate made the first modern one, the ST-506 in 1980. It was 5.25 inches wide and fit in a slot the same size as the 5.25-inch floppy drive.Not many computer technologies survive 40 years in pretty much the same format.Turns out, however, the first 5MB hard drive was made by IBM (NYSE:IBM) (who else?) in 1956.That one is a little wider than the 5.25 inch ST-506.Now in 2020 let's take a look at something that has storage 500 times the storage capacity of the above 5MB drives.Yep, a Fitbit watch has 2.5GB of storage.The above just shows you the enormous advances made in computer storage in the last 65 years. Survival in the storage business requires endless, every day, non-stop product improvement. That's why as of today it is basically a duopoly between STX and Western Digital (WDC).Here are 5 reasons I like STX.As you can see from the chart below, STX has bought back almost 50% of its shares that were outstanding at the end of 2010. And you can rest assured it will not stop here.Gianluca Romano, CFO speaking in the latest quarter:Buying back shares is part of STX's capital policy, not the on-again, off-again, maybe yes, maybe no, non-commitment often shown by other companies that have announced buybacks.Every year for 11 years is a commitment.Seagate has a policy of returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends as part of its capital use policy. This is not once in a while item but on the agenda every single quarter.Gianluca Romano, CFO:Note that prime competitor Western Digital announced they had eliminated their dividend on April 30.David Goeckeler, Western Digital CEO:In an oldline tech industry like HDDs, the fact that revenue is going up every quarter is a sign the technology is not going away any time soon. And keep in mind over 90% of STX's revenue is HDD.STX is not only selling more, but they are also increasing their profit per share too. This is partially the result of its unrelenting focus on share buybacks.STX may be a classic case when overall sentiment is bad (COVID-19, oil price shock, etc.) even good results don't help. The corollary of this is, of course, the share price may right itself sooner rather than later.The downward dots on the graph is the trendline.It would make sense that if more and more people stay home and work from home, more storage will be required not less. All the material you stream needs to be stored somewhere and most likely it is on HDDs.And any company that loves their shareholders as much as Seagate does deserves to be loved back.Seagate is a buy under $50.In this volatile market, all investment decisions deserve extra caution. Who knows what Congress and the Fed may do going forward?Meaning extraordinary caution is required for all investments including this one.And remember, there is nothing wrong with being in cash at this point in time until the market shows less volatility and more firm direction. Cash is a viable alternative."
4305577,104099,2019-11-11T19:56:39-05:00,"I think Seagate is a great business, with a very attractive and sustainable dividend.My problem with the name relates to the fact that valuations are currently at multi-year highs. In my view, investors are betting that cash flow will improve dramatically.For those not interested in simply waiting for shares to drop in price, I offer a short put that I think presents a win-win for investors.","Seagate Technology (STX) is up about 45% since I put out my bullish call on the company just over a year ago, against an 11% return for the S&P 500, so that's gratifying. Additionally, the short puts that I recommended worked out well, which adds to the return. The problem is that the company obviously has a much different risk profile at $59 per share than it did back at $43, so I must look in on the name. Also, as I stated in the first article, in my view this isn't a ""buy and forget"" type of investment, and an investor in the name must be willing to attempt to ""ride the cycle."" Since the company has obviously published some financial statements since I last wrote about it, I'll update my financial review. In addition, I'll look at the stock itself as a thing distinct from the underlying business. For those who can stand neither the suspense nor my writing, I'll leap right on the point: I'll be selling my Seagate at these levels, based simply on valuation. For investors approaching this name for the first time, I have a short put recommendation.Seagate is obviously a cyclical company, as evidenced by both the variability in revenue and net income. That variability was on full display when the company reported its most recent quarterly results, with revenue and net income down ~14% and 56%, respectively, from the same period a year ago. In my opinion, this one quarter of performance isn't significant except insofar as it serves as a demonstration that this is a variable business.Turning to the balance sheet, I think the capital structure here remains quite strong for two reasons. First, the company's long-term debt is matched by fully 43% of cash and equivalents on hand. Second, fully 56% of long-term debt is due after 2024, suggesting little reason to fear a credit or solvency crisis anytime soon.Finally, it must be said that management has treated shareholders exceedingly well in my view. In particular, it has returned just over $10.1 billion to shareholders since 2014 ($6 billion in the form of stock buybacks, the balance from dividend payments). In my view, shareholder-friendly management is critical, as an unfriendly management almost guarantees capital loss. This combination of dividends and stock buybacks has caused shares outstanding to drop at a CAGR of ~4%, and dividends per share to grow at a CAGR of ~7% since 2014.Source: Company filingsSo, in sum, I'd say that the financial history here is still quite solid. There'll be ups and downs in the business cycle, but there's no significant risk from the point of view of someone with a time horizon beyond a single cycle.As I've said many times, there's much more to investing well than simply buying stock in a company like Seagate. The stock itself is often governed by forces that have little if anything to do with the underlying business. For instance, monetary policy has loomed large in the minds of investors for years, as investors start to focus more on liquidity flows. For that reason, I need to spend some time writing about the stock itself, and specifically trying to answer whether now is a good time to buy.If the market is excessively optimistic, that's a bad sign in my view, because sooner or later, any company will have a misstep. If the shares are optimistically priced at the time of that misstep, they will drop in price. So, I want to find shares that the market isn't particularly optimistic about. One of the ways I use to judge optimism is to look at price to free cash flow.I was particularly intrigued by Seagate last year because the stock was trading at just over six times free cash flow. This was particularly interesting to me because in four of the five times the company traded at that valuation over the previous seven years, the stock went on to do very well. The idea was that history may not repeat, but it certainly rhymes.At the moment, the shares are trading at multi-year high valuations. Per the graphic below, the shares haven't been this expensive on a price to free cash flow basis since 2012, which is troublesome in my estimation. Investors need to remember that the more they pay for a series of future cash flows, the lower will be their subsequent returns. ""Troublesome"" doesn't mean ""disqualified from consideration,"" because it is possible for the shares to rally nicely from these valuations as the historical record demonstrates. In my view, in order to rally, a dramatic turnaround has to take place. Cash flow will have to increase fairly dramatically in a very short span of time. It's not impossible for this to happen, but such transformations are rare. For that reason, I can't recommend putting new money to work in Seagate until prices drop and/or cash flow increases dramatically.Data by YChartsGiven my history here, I'm obviously willing to buy this name in the mid-$40s. I have a choice, therefore, to either wait for the shares to drop to that level again, which is a prospect I don't relish, given that I'm impatient by nature. Alternatively, I could sell puts with that strike price, to generate some yield now. I consider this option the superior one to sitting and waiting for the stock to fall in price. If the shares flatline or rise in price from here, I'll simply pocket the premium and drive on. If the shares drop, I'll be obliged to buy, but will do so at a level that I find acceptable. In any event, being obliged to buy at $45 at some future date is superior to buying at $58 today.At the moment, my favorite puts here are the June 2020 Seagate puts with a strike of $45. These are currently bid-asked at $1.60-1.63. So, if an investor simply takes the bid here, and is subsequently exercised, they will buy Seagate at a net price ~26% below the current level. At that point, the dividend yield will obviously be over 25% greater than it is now, holding all else constant.In my previous article, I suggested that people who weren't convinced of my bullish arguments sell the March 2019 puts with a strike of $42.50, which were at the time bid at $2.50. After spiking in value in the teeth of the Q4 2018 market decline, these eventually expired worthless, which enhanced the return even further. The strategy worked well in the past, in my view, and I think it makes sense to do the same again.I think Seagate is an excellent business, and I have fond feelings for the stock, given that it's been a very profitable trade for me. That said, valuation matters a great deal and at the moment the valuation is a bit rich in my view, particularly in light of the evident softness in the business. I came to the party early last year, and it may be the case that I'm leaving the party early now; but in my view, investors must be disciplined in our approach to valuation. That said, I think there's always something to do, and in this case, I think a short put at least presents the opportunity to generate some premiums today. I think this is a great business, but I think the shares have gotten ahead of themselves. For those not interested in the short put, I would recommend waiting until price drops to match value."
4279067,77985,2019-07-30T14:08:28-04:00,"Seagate continues to rely on HDDs even though they are in danger of being overtaken by SSDs, which offer superior performance at a higher price.The price gap between HDDs and SSDs continues to shrink, but recent events could potentially turn that around in favor of Seagate.If higher prices for SSDs leads to higher sales of HDDs, Seagate stands to benefit from the windfall gain.As long as the current situation remains the same, Seagate will most likely continue to do what it has been doing for the last four years.","Seagate (STX) is a company that is closely associated with the hard disk drive (“HDD”), a device that stores and retrieves data from rotating disks or platters. HDDs have been around for decades, but the technology is in danger of being supplanted by a new generation of solid state drives (“SSDs”) that rely on NAND memory chips to store and retrieve data.The specter of obsolescence is something that has been hanging over Seagate’s bread and butter and probably the biggest reason why a number of investors are wary of the stock. Why consider a company that relies on technology that is very likely to become obsolete one day. However, investors should not necessarily ignore the stock because the stock can still make gains. All Seagate needs for it to happen are favorable circumstances that lead to, for instance, windfall sales and profits. If that happens, the stock could jump based on such positive development.Yes, Seagate will eventually have to reinvent itself when HDDs are no longer needed in the long run and they’re completely replaced by SSDs. But that day is still a long way from here since the whole process of replacing HDDs will take years to complete. In the meantime, the amount of data that needs to be stored continues to grow rapidly. All that growth in data requires a cost-effective storage option. So there is still a market for HDDs and Seagate by extension.In fact, HDD demand may rise in the near future due to unforeseen circumstances that could cause problems for SSDs, its main competitor. If this happens, Seagate could be set to receive an unexpected windfall gain in sales and profits. That could help Seagate’s stock which hasn’t made much progress in the last four years and is actually at the same price level it was in July 2015.The Japanese government decided on June 30th that it will impose restrictions on South Korea by requiring its companies to get permission for the import of fluorinated polyimides, photoresists and hydrogen fluoride from Japanese suppliers. The last two items are important materials that South Korea’s Samsung and SK Hynix need to make NAND memory chips.If Samsung and SK Hynix are unable to source materials from Japan, then their ability to produce NAND chips could be severely curtailed. That should push up SSD prices because Samsung and SK Hynix combine for roughly 40% of global production of NAND chips as the table below indicates. If there are not enough NAND chips, memory prices will rise and manufacturers of SSDs will have to raise their own prices to adjust for higher input costs.Source: DramexchangeSpot prices for NAND memory chips have already been on the rise since the beginning of July. If this continues, SSD prices will inevitably rise along with higher memory prices. That should make HDDs more attractive to buyers who have to pick between HDDs and SSDs for their storage needs. Seagate would be the beneficiary in such a situation by making its products more competitive versus the competition.SSDs are superior in almost all aspects compared to HDDs. For instance, SSDs support much higher data transfer speeds than HDDs, SSDs are less prone to mechanical malfunctions since they do not contain any moving parts like HDDs and SSDs consume less power than HDDs. But there is one area where HDDs are still ahead of SSDs and that is cost. HDDs are on average significantly cheaper per gigabyte than SSDs.However, prices for NAND chips have been going down in recent years. SSDs have become more affordable and the price gap that exists between the two products has narrowed tremendously. More and more people have been opting for SSDs and their superior performance. That has hurt sales of HDDs and Seagate by extension.Unit shipments of SSDs could even surpass those of HDDs for the first time in as little as two years if the current trend persists. The table below shows units shipments for HDDs and SSDs in recent years. Notice that the gap between the two has shrunk drastically in the last several years. In some market segments, such as laptops, SSDs have already surpassed HDDs in market share.Source: StatistaHow much HDDs are in need of a boost becomes obvious if one takes a look at data from Nidec Corporation. Nidec supplies most of the small precision motors that are used in HDDs from Seagate and other HDD manufacturers such as Western Digital. Since demand for HDDs has been going down, so too have shipments of these small motors from Nidec.Source: NidecNidec expects the HDD market to shrink from 376M units in 2018 to 309M in 2019, an 18% decline. If this turns out to be correct, the HDD market will have decreased by 45.2% since 2014 when 564M HDD units were shipped. The market for HDDs is expected to continue to decrease in 2020.The decline in HDD sales is primarily driven by lower prices for SSDs. Up until quite recently, SSD prices had been going down steadily. According to reports from Dramexchange and Trendforce, SSD prices were expected to hit an all-time low of under $0.10 per gigabyte before the end of 2019. The hope for Seagate is that the dispute between South Korea and Japan shakes things up.It’s clear from the data available that the current trend in the market is not in favor of Seagate. If this continues, Seagate has every reason to be concerned. So if something can turn the tide and cause people to switch back to HDDs, then that would be good news for Seagate.The one area where Seagate has made good progress is in the amount of data that can be stored on one of its hard disk platters. The areal density continues to improve, which has allowed Seagate to increase the capacity of its HDDs even if the number of units shipped remains stagnant. The table below shows how Seagate has managed to increase HDD capacity.Source: SeagateHowever, technological progress has not helped with earnings. Seagate is currently in somewhat of a rough patch with declining revenue and net income for the last three quarters. Seagate could turn that around if SSD prices rise due to a shortage of NAND chips. The longer the market for NAND chips is disrupted by tensions between South Korea and Japan, the more likely Seagate is to benefit.Source: Wikimedia CommonsIt’s important to remind people that the restrictions imposed by Japan on South Korea do not amount to an actual ban. As an article from JapanTimes explains:In other words, South Korean producers of memory chips have at this point not been barred from obtaining semiconductor materials and they should be able to continue production as long as that is the case. The perceived benefits to Seagate from the dispute between South Korea and Japan are only a theoretical possibility that have yet to become reality. Seagate will only benefit if Japan goes ahead and blocks South Korea from obtaining semiconductor materials, which will lead to higher prices for NAND chips and SSDs.This is why any investor with an interest in Seagate should keep a close eye on what happens between South Korea and Japan. If the situation seems to be escalating, memory prices are likely to move higher. This would be positive for Seagate because it increases the odds that it will stand to benefit. The stock is likely to move higher in anticipation of this happening. Anyone long will be rewarded at this point. But if there’s no escalation and the situation remains as is, then it’s best to stay on the sidelines when it comes to Seagate.If Japan decides for whatever reason that South Korea can continue to import materials from Japan as long as they do the paperwork, prices for NAND chips and SSDs will not remain elevated as some hope for. Seagate will then be left with the same situation that confronted it before the outbreak of the dispute between Japan and South Korea. As long as this is the case, Seagate is likely to remain stuck where it is right now - basically, going sideways in a trading range."
4320931,101985,2020-02-03T09:45:00-05:00,The earnings growth story is superb for Seagate Technology.Seagate is expanding its product line to meet the increasing demand of the data storage market.An attractive dividend yield along with a healthy balance sheet make the company favorable.The common equity is undervalued when compared to some market peers.,"With a healthy balance sheet and an impressive earnings growth story, Seagate Technology (STX) is an interesting opportunity in the tech space. Data storage demand has been growing rapidly and Seagate is well-positioned with its product line to address the market. Dividends have been growing, and technicals show an uptrend for the common equity. The company could be a great fit for retirement portfolios.Source: weableSeagate Technology has over 41,000 employees around the world. The company provides hard disk drives, hybrid drives, and lastly solid-state drives. One of the key products that are interesting is the Exos X, which is an enterprise hard drive with high storage densities along with increased efficiency compared to market alternatives. The company sells the largest enterprise drives with the Exos X16 edition that comes with 16 terabytes of storage capacity.Earnings for the company grew at 2.6% per year over the past five years. The equity trades at 9.5x earnings, which is pretty cheap compared to the tech industry average of 26.1x. Net profit margins improved over the last year to 17.7%, compared to 12.7% for the year prior. Earnings growth showed a remarkable jump over the past year to 20.2%, compared to the five-year average of 2.6%. However, this is still a big drop from the three-year average of 66.7%. Operating cash flow covers debt pretty easily, while the company provides a solid dividend yield of 4.15%, which makes it a perfect fit for constructing a retirement portfolio for the future that can generate income.The dividend growth story is also attractive considering that dividends started getting paid out only nine years ago by the company, while dividends increased all nine years. The dividend payout ratio of the company stood at 39.6%, which means that dividend payments are covered by earnings. Looking at competitors the company is undervalued. Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) trades at 20.65x earnings, while another competitor Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) trades at 17.97x earnings. The price to sales ratio was 1.68, while Micron Technology was at 2.97 and Applied Materials at 3.82. Both metrics show an undervalued case in favor of Seagate Technology. Consolidated financials for the most recently reported quarter can be found here.Over the last few years, data storage companies have not been able to meet demand. There is a clear shortage in the data storage space. More on the topic can be found here. Data capacity sold is a huge revenue driver for the company, we can see a huge increase in this figure with the organic growth in storage demand. Durable solutions for both consumer and commercial products show a great upside. The company has recently announced at a tech event that it will start producing modular storage solutions to manage complex data storage for businesses. The enterprise is also expanding its product line with a new external storage solution that is targeting gamers with the new FireCuda Gaming SSD, which is an external hard drive.The design of the new hard drive is similar to the FireCuda Gaming Dock which was launched around the end of last year. More on the new products can be found here. The competitive advantage of the company is that they make the heat-assisted magnetic recording technology in their data storage products. The technology basically can make data bits more densely packed and as a result smaller in size. This is incrementally better than the perpendicular magnetic recording technology that was used in the past. Enterprise demand should increase due to the demand for capacity.Data by YChartsThe equity has gained upside momentum ever since the golden cross between the 50 and 200-day exponential moving average that occurred in September of last year. Bullish momentum has been persistent ever since September of last year. The equity is trading at $61.44 as I am writing. The company has beaten analysts' earnings estimates for eight quarters straight, hence the announcement for December 2019 earnings could also beat analysts' expectations. Earnings are expected to be announced on the 4th of February. As the announcement comes closer, investors can position themselves beforehand. I am expecting the uptrend that has been relevant since September of last year to continue pushing the data storage company higher.Year-end revenues for the company have been declining over recent years and what worries me is that if this trend continues going forward. The company has only been paying dividends for nine years which is not a long time. If the company pays out a dividend this fiscal year, this will mean that the company will have paid out dividends for 10 years straight. Hence, dividends could be reliable and sustainable in the eyes of most dividend seekers. A low payout ratio also makes dividend payments sustainable. Technically, the equity is in a consolidation period and generally, consolidations are followed by breakouts in either direction.A downside movement could bring the equity down to $52 a share if momentum adds up. Earnings growth slowed down from its three-year average despite the jump last year as I've mentioned. This could be due to a decline in demand over the last year for video and image applications. Off Wall Street gave a short recommendation for Seagate outlining how they believe that solid-state drives will replace hard disk drives within computing applications.Seagate has a firm position among hard disk drive manufacturers. However, the company could lose market share to competitors as other firms introduce products that carry lower manufacturing risks to produce. 92% of revenues were generated from hard-disk drives at the company in the last reported quarter. The company is reliant on hard disk drive sales and needs to shift production to solid-state drives as soon as possible.With the widespread demand for data storage, Seagate has quietly become a big player in the data storage industry. With top lines growing and an attractive technical setup, the equity is in a superb position for the future. Investors need to be on the lookout for the next earnings announcement, which will show us if the growth story in earnings is still ongoing. If it is, the equity could be a superb fit for retirement portfolios. The company diversifying its product line should also reflect positively for the company. I am bullish in the data storage company until a slowdown in earnings growth occurs or until metrics show an overvalued case, which it does not currently."

While the report contained a mix of good and bad, management’s outlook for the rest of FY 2020 calls for improvement. But there is a potential problem lurking beneath the surface. What that issue is will be covered next.Revenue declined by 13.8% to $2.58B in FQ1. Net income declined by 45.9% to $278M. Both numbers did beat estimates for the quarter and they increased on a sequential basis. But margins dropped by 4.4%. The table below lists the numbers for FQ1 2020 and compares them to a year ago.Source: SeagateTough comps are Seagate’s explanation for the sizable decline in revenue and net income. While demand for storage is recovering, it’s not quite at the same level it was a year ago. Management explains in the FQ1 earnings call:A transcript of the earnings call can be found here.On the other hand, Seagate is expecting demand to improve in the coming quarters.Calendar year 2020 will be a lot stronger than 2019, according to management.The quarterly report also reveals a fundamental shift in end users. The mass capacity category consist of nearline, video and image applications and NAS. It’s a growing market that requires high-capacity, low-cost storage for data-centric applications. Mass capacity now accounts for the majority of all revenue at 47%, a 12% increase over the last two years. The legacy market, which includes desktop and notebook applications, has been reduced to 46%.In addition to the quarterly numbers, Seagate reported progress in several areas. For instance, Seagate is now mass producing 16-terabyte HDDs, the only company to do so. Seagate has high expectations for these HDDs as the company explains in the earnings call:Furthermore, HAMR and MACH.2 dual-actuator technology will enable higher capacity drives in the future. From the FQ1 earnings call:These new drives should facilitate further increases in exabyte shipments. Shipments reached 98 exabyte in FQ1, a 16% increase QoQ. Nearline products were primarily responsible for this growth.Seagate sees surveillance as a growth opportunity because it utilizes high-definition video and image processing. Yet it is this application that is being confronted with some headwinds. From the FQ1 earnings call:Among the customers sourcing surveillance products from Seagate are a number of providers of video surveillance equipment from China. For example, Dahua Technology and Hikvision, the latter reportedly the world’s largest maker of video surveillance gear.However, both companies were placed on the Entity List by the U.S. government on October 9, which means that Seagate cannot supply either company unless it receives permission from the government. The inability to supply certain customers in China could further pressure revenue from surveillance, which had already decreased due to some surveillance customers accelerating demand into the June quarter.As mentioned previously, gross margins declined by 4.4% to 26.7% in Q1. Such margins are down from where they should be at this point if we go by past cycles. Seagate did not specify the exact reason for this decline, except to mention that a combination of factors were at work. From the FQ1 earnings call:Seagate sees lower demand as contributing to lower margins. Another factor are costs associated with ramping up production.Nevertheless, management is looking for margins to improve starting in FQ2.Lower margins are acceptable if they turn out to be temporary. But if lower margins turn out to be structural for whatever reason, then there’s cause for concern.The manufacture of HDDs requires a fairly large number of small parts, some of which have to move at very high speeds. Such a configuration is not conductive to reliability from an engineering point of view, which explains why HDDs are known to be fragile. HAMR goes one step further by adding the element of heat, which can be regarded as the enemy of semiconductors and electronics in general. This combination of tiny parts, high speed and heat is why quite a few people are skeptical of HAMR, even though Seagate is betting heavily on the technology.It’s possible that new advances being introduced, such as HAMR and dual-actuator technology, are just more complex and thus more expensive to manufacture in comparison to older technology. Yields may also not be as good as they were with older drives. If that’s the case, earnings will be affected as lower margins could become more of a structural issue. It’s too early to tell, but it’s something worth keeping an eye on.Source: Wikimedia CommonsSeagate represents somewhat of a conundrum. On the one hand, Seagate targets a storage market that is thriving due to the secular growth in data. Data keeps on increasing and all that data needs to be stored somewhere. Emerging industries such as 5G and AI will only increase the growth of data. The long-term prospects for storage solutions remain strong, which works in favor of Seagate.On the other hand, Seagate’s main products are HDDs. But HDDs are increasingly being replaced by SSDs in many applications, especially in traditional ones such as desktops and notebooks. HDDs are retreating into the data-centric market where their low cost remains a plus. Still, HDDs are in an arms race with SSDs since the latter are becoming cheaper all the time with NAND chips falling in price. The long-term prospects of HDDs are iffy at best, which goes against Seagate.The challenge for Seagate is to stay ahead of SSDs with low-cost, high-capacity HDDs since the former are improving at such a rapid pace. SSD remain the more expensive option, but it’s not certain that will always be the case. That is why it’s crucial that Seagate continues to innovate with new technologies such as HAMR to stay ahead in the cost curve. HAMR has to deliver and not experience any hiccups or the consequences could be severe for Seagate.The drop in margins is unsettling from that standpoint. As Seagate continues to push the envelope in areal density, manufacturing will likely become more complex. Increased complexity tends to push up costs, but costs need to be kept under control if HDDs are to remain cheaper than SSDs. The day SSDs close the gap in cost is the day that HDDs become obsolete.Seagate knows that the market has changed and is trying to evolve and adapt to a new environment. It is focusing on applications which need the greatest amount of storage for the least amount of money. But one has to wonder if that strategy can only delay the inevitable, but not fundamentally alter the course the company is on. Magnetic storage can only go so far with its inherent limitations.Seagate says that margins will improve and they deserve the benefit of the doubt. However, one could also argue that it’s not a matter of if, but when SSDs overtake HDDs. Taking into account the company’s weak position in the market for solid state drives, it’s probably best to be neutral on Seagate. The stock could do well in the short term, but it’s not a good choice if someone is interested in a long-term investment."
4295239,105334,2019-10-06T07:35:51-04:00,"Seagate Technology believes it can grow its revenues based on higher data creation.The company has also provided a technological roadmap with HAMR and dual actuators as key products.The long-term target financial model expects stronger-than-expected revenues, but softer operating margins.STX should be seen as a dividend play amid falling interest rates. Upside potential is limited amid the tough operating environment.","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) may be swimming against the technological tide, but it's not all doom and gloom - management recently laid out its medium-term game plan, emphasizing incremental investment spending to support the accelerating exabyte growth trend. The company plans to expand mass capacity storage 5X by FY2024 and is on track with new heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) drives (expected to be shipped by the latter part of FY2020).The long-term financials are projected to be resilient: revenue growth of 2-6%, operating margins of 13-16%, with 50% of free cash flow set to be returned to shareholders.While STX continues to execute well operationally and has made good progress amid tough technology challenges, I am skeptical of the company's top-line growth guidance given the secular challenges in the HDD industry - historically, STX's revenues and gross profit have experienced declines driven by the heightened competition. Taking a more conservative viewpoint, I see a lower FY 2020 EPS by 6% year on year to around $4.50 per share.Shares currently trade at a 29% premium over fair value of $40.5 per share (based on a 9X P/E multiple on estimated earnings). The premium is attributable to the recent rally - shares have gained 33.8% YTD as investors flock on high dividend payers such as STX amid falling interest rates. Though the dividend case (STX offers a dividend yield of 4.8%) may be compelling in the short run, I am skeptical of Seagate's long-term prospects.Seagate Technology outlined its outlook and strategy over the next five years, highlighting its growth potential in terms of its mass capacity storage, technology roadmap, and long-term financial guidance.(1) HDD Demand in line with Data Creation Growth: Seagate presented its case for a positive long-term total addressable market (TAM) outlook, driven by the expansion in data creation - mainly from areas such as Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things, which will inevitably increase the need for storage.In particular, management referenced the IDC Data Age 2025 Report, which projected that global data creation would grow from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to 175 zettabytes in 2025.Source: Seagate Analyst Day PresentationSTX believes that more than 90% of bits for mass storage will be on HDDs in 2025, considering the lowest absolute cost per bit offered by HDDs. Given these expectations, STX estimates the TAM for HDD mass storage to reach $27 billion to 30 billion by 2025.Source: Seagate Analyst Day Presentation(2) Technological Roadmap: The company also showcased its heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) capabilities and mentioned that it would have a 20 TB HAMR drive by the end of FY 2020 as well as a subsequent ramp in FY 2021. HAMR has the potential to scale further compared to other energy-assisted technologies due to its higher energy capacity, with management planning to release a 30+ TB and 50+ HAMR drive in FY 2023 and FY 2026, respectively.Source: Seagate Analyst Day PresentationSTX also presented its new MACH.2 dual actuator drive, which offers about 520 MB per second of IOPS, 2X faster than the I/O of a single actuator drive, albeit with moderately higher power consumption.Source: Seagate Analyst Day PresentationOn the other hand, Seagate is already shipping 16TB HDDs with volumes expected to increase in December, providing an early advantage over Western Digital Corp. (WDC), which is currently shipping 14TB HDDs at the high-end of its portfolio.Source: Seagate Analyst Day PresentationHowever, the company will have to commit a sizable portion of its cash flows to cover for these investments. Per guidance, plans are for at least $600 million a year in capex, or 6% to 8% of revenues.(3) Historical Financial Performance & Long-Term Guidance: Over the past five years, STX has continued to generate positive FCF (ranging from $1 billion to $1.9 billion), reflective of the company's focus on operational discipline, capital allocation, and strategy execution.Management also announced that it will continue to return at least 50% of FCF to investors and has more than $2 billion in available share repurchase authorization. So far, the company has returned more than $5 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which should further increase in the future considering it recently raised its dividends by 3%.Source: Seagate Analyst Day PresentationFurther, the company is operating more efficiently now with a leaner manufacturing footprint - as of FY19, the number of production sites has decreased to 7 (vs. 14 sites in 2016), boosting its returns on capital and freeing up more cash flows.Source: Seagate Analyst Day PresentationIn terms of long-term guidance, the company sees revenue growth of 2% to 6% and operating margins of 13% to 16%. On the revenue front, this is stronger than expected since consensus estimates are for a slight decline (-1.7% in FY 2020 and -1.4% in 2021) in revenues. While this guidance is positive, it should be met with healthy skepticism as the industry is still struggling to show consistent revenue growth.Data by YChartsWhile operating margin guidance is strong at 13% to 16%, the company did adjust the useful life of its equipment from 3-5 years to 3-7 years, adding around $100 million of annual operating income, which may not have been factored into consensus estimates. Excluding the positive impact of this accounting change, guidance would have been much softer than consensus (14% to 16%).The company did not provide details on EPS, except that it expects EPS growth in the long term. Conservatively, I'd assume that FY 2020 EPS will modestly decline to $4.50 per share (-6.6% year on year), but will slightly recover to $4.75 per share (+5.5%); EPS decline is triggered by our lower revenue expectations, in line with secular challenges that the company is facing in the HDD industry, although STX's long-term revenue recovery will be driven by the expansion in data creation.I believe fair value lies at $40.5, implying current share prices are trading at a 29% premium. My estimate of fair value is derived by applying a 9X P/E multiple (based on Western Digital Corp. FY 2020 P/E multiple) on FY 2020 EPS of $4.50 per share. While STX has historically traded between 7X to 12X, I do not see further multiple expansion until the industry shows consistent financial performance. Nonetheless, income investors continue to see STX as dividend play (yield of 4-5%) in a low-interest rate scenario, resulting in shares gaining 33.8% this year.Seagate believes that it will be able to grow its revenues as the demand for data rises, albeit amid a tough competitive environment. Over the past years, the company has done a commendable job of executing its operations and allocating its capital; the company should continue posting resilient FCF numbers in the foreseeable future. The capital allocation policy is also a big plus - management raised the dividend, which should attract more income-seeking investors. However, shares trade at a premium of ~29% to fair value following the YTD rally, and bottom-line guidance seems optimistic. With shares already pricing in the optimism, I expect further downside from here."
4323506,77985,2020-02-12T12:56:58-05:00,"Seagate managed to improve revenue and net income sequentially thanks to higher margins, although they remain lower YoY.Margin improvement was made possible by a change in product mix, especially by shipping more high-capacity drives.The double-digit increase in exabytes shipped was offset by an equally large price erosion.Seagate has no choice other than to ramp up exabytes shipped, but several factors may impede with its ability to continue doing this.","Seagate Technology (STX) released its Q2 FY2020 quarterly report on February 4. The results were mixed, although the outlook was better than expected. However, there were also other issues that will have to be addressed at some point as time goes by. What these issues are will be covered next.Seagate managed to beat earnings estimates, but fell short on revenue. Net income increased by double digits QoQ, but decreased YoY. Revenue displayed a similar pattern, although the swings were less pronounced. Gross margin also recovered in Q2 from the sizable drop in Q1. However, Q2 gross margin remained lower compared to a year ago. Non-GAAP gross margin of 28.7% was slightly above estimates.Source: Seagate Form 8-KSeagate's forecast was slightly better than expected. The outlook for Q3 calls for non-GAAP EPS of $1.35, plus or minus 7%, and revenue of $2.7B, plus or minus 7%.One of the things that stood out in the Q1 quarterly report was the sizable drop in margins. However, Seagate managed to turn this around in Q2. Gross margin improved by as much as 200 basis points. The credit goes to a shift in product mix towards mass capacity drives. From the Q2 earnings call:A transcript of the Q2 FY2020 earnings call can be found here.Gross margin in Q2 also benefited from higher volumes and cost reduction. Q3 may once again get a lift from some or all of these three factors.Apparently, Seagate shipped one million 16-terabytes HDDs, which is currently the highest-capacity drive in mass production.HDDs with even higher capacities are coming. The first HAMR drive is expected to become available in late 2020.Higher volumes of high-capacity drives allowed Seagate to set a new record in the amount of exabytes shipped. Seagate sees room for further growth in exabytes shipped.Demand for more storage is on the rise.However, while demand for storage may not be a problem, other areas may become one if they continue on the same path.Seagate is seeing changes in its product mix. In just one year, mass capacity and legacy traded places as can be seen in the table below. Mass capacity increased to 49% of revenue from 39% a year ago. In contrast, legacy declined from 53% to 43%. Note that Q2 revenue decreased by 0.7% compared to a year ago. Revenue growth in mass capacity was barely enough to compensate for the shrinking of the legacy business. Nearline accounted for the bulk of mass capacity with 49 out of 71.3 exabytes.Source: Seagate Form 10-QWhile legacy is getting smaller, it remains an important part of Seagate. From the Q2 earnings call:Any loss in legacy will be felt and needs to be compensated elsewhere.But making up for legacy seems to be getting harder to do. Seagate increased exabytes shipped from 87 to 107 exabytes, an increase of 23% in one year. Yet, revenue still decreased by 0.7%. Seagate is being confronted with substantial price erosion. The average price per terabyte fell from $28 a year ago to $23 in Q2, a decline of 23% YoY. Price erosion was thus able to offset the increase in exabytes shipped.The increase in average capacity was enabled by the move towards more higher-capacity drives. Average capacity per drive jumped by 37% from 2.4 terabytes to 3.3 terabytes. However, getting all HDD customers to make the move towards higher-capacity drives is getting more and more difficult. Not everybody seems to need or want these high-capacity drives.So on the one hand, Seagate needs the market to adopt high-capacity drives to keep increasing exabytes shipped at a fast clip. If exabytes shipped had been lower, the hit to revenue would have been even bigger. On the other hand, the market is becoming slower in adopting the latest in HDDs and is sticking with older drives for a lot longer than before. This makes it increasingly difficult to keep up the pace in exabytes shipped.Source: Wikimedia CommonsThe latest quarterly report from Seagate shows that progress has been made in certain areas. A recovery in margins helped improve the headline numbers, at least on a sequential basis. But a closer look reveals signs that the company is regressing in other areas, which may lay the ground work for bigger problems down the road.Seagate's legacy business continues to shrink, which puts pressure on mass capacity to pick up the slack. Mass capacity, especially nearline, tends to rely heavily on cloud spending. While cloud spending continues to grow, growth is uneven and can sometimes contract. The move towards mass capacity makes Seagate increasingly prone to cyclical ups and downs in a way that people have not seen before from the company.While there's no doubt that there is strong demand for storage, the actual benefit to Seagate has been much less. Seagate's annual revenue seems to have peaked in late 2012 at over $16B and has been trending lower ever since. This decline has coincided with the rise of NAND flash memory, which has become, more often than not, the preferred storage option in the competition with HDDs. Seagate will likely end the year at around $10B, which implies that topline will have shrunk by almost 40% in eight years. Seagate has yet to show that this trend will end anytime soon.Mass capacity is growing, but comes with a heavy burden. Seagate increased exabytes shipped by double digits just to keep revenue from taking a bigger hit due to price erosion. In order to keep increasing exabytes shipped, Seagate needs to increase capacity per drive. End users also have to make the switch to higher-capacity HDDs, which is getting harder to do.There is a lot of pressure on Seagate to come up with new technologies like HAMR to enable drives with higher capacities. The introduction of new technology can give rise to further complications as this article points out. Seagate needs HAMR to be nothing but a success, if exabytes shipped is to increase at a fast enough pace to offset pressure elsewhere.With these issues in mind, it's best to be neutral on Seagate. There is reason to question whether Seagate can continue on the path it is currently on. Seagate has been able to increase exabytes shipped at a rapid clip, but it's anyone's guess as to how long this can last."

Based on my M.A.D Assessment STX has a Dividend Strength score of 72 and a Stock Strength score of 99.In this article I will demonstrate why I believe that in spite of these high scores, dividend growth investors should not invest in Seagate Technology PLC.Source: mad-dividends.comSeagate Technology public limited company, incorporated on January 22, 2010, is a provider of electronic data storage technology and solutions.The company’s principal products are hard disk drives (HDDs). In addition to HDDs, the company produces a range of electronic data storage products, including solid state hybrid drives (SSHDs), solid state drives (SSDs), peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) cards and serial advanced technology architecture (SATA) controllers.The company competes with Western Digital Corporation and Toshiba Corporation.The analysis presented in this article is divided into two sections - dividend strength and stock strength.For me dividend strength and stock strength are two distinct phenomena. Companies with a high dividend strength score are ones which are interesting to dividend investors as they have a strong dividend supported by strong underlying fundamentals and are more likely to continue paying and growing their dividends. Whereas stocks with high stock strength are likely to be good picks for capital gain investors.As such companies which score well in both categories are more likely to have higher total returns (capital + dividend).A strong dividend stock is one that will:So I look at 2 different aspects - how likely the company is to be able to continue paying the dividend (safety) and how likely it is to grow (potential),In order to assess the dividend safety, I will analyze the coverage & payout ratios. Dividend potential will be assessed by focusing on the company's dividend yield, historical dividend growth as well as evolution of top and bottom-line results throughout the past years.Seagate Technology PLC has an earnings payout ratio of 44%. This makes STX's payout ratio better than 44% of dividend stocks. This good as I tend to favour sub 60% payout ratiosI then look at cashflow payout ratio; which is dividends in relation to operating cashflow. By looking at cashflow payout as well as earnings payout, I get a better grip of the company's ability to pay its dividend. Dividends represent 38% of STX’s operating cashflow, which puts the company in front of 30% of dividend stocks.Finally, I look at the company's free cash flow payout. This adjusts operating cashflow for capital expenditures & paints the clearest picture of whether the company can afford its dividend. 60% of Seagate Technology PLC's free cashflow are paid out as dividends, putting it ahead of 34% of dividend stocks.Based on these numbers, I believe Seagate Technology PLC’s pay-out ratio to be decent. From the chart below we can see that despite the increase in net income payout ratio the dividends were comfortably covered by the cash from operations and free cash flow ratios. For 2018 all 3 ratios are 60% or below which is good.Source: mad-dividends.comI also want to make sure that the company is earns enough to cover its interest payments, and more broadly to service its debt.STX has an interest coverage ratio of 36x which is better than 93% of stocks. This level of coverage is more than adequate.Given the coverage and payout ratios, it would seem like STX’s dividend is safe.Next, we look at the stock’s potential to pay us a decent dividend, which grows at a satisfying rate.Source: mad-dividends.comSeagate Technology PLC has a dividend yield of 5.23% which is better than 87% of dividend stocks. Over the last 5 years the company has seen an average dividend growth of 9%. As good as this may seem it must be noted that the dividend has not increased in the last 36 months. As we have seen in the coverage ratios the company has the excess cash to increase dividends and maybe it will start doing so.Source: mad-dividends.comDuring the last 3 years, the company’s revenues have not grown showing a -2% CAGR, while net income has grown at a 39% CAGR.Source: mad-dividends.comAlthough the annual figures show a return to low revenue growth, the most recent quarter shows a decrease in revenues compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter 1 year ago.For a company to continue paying a growing dividend in the foreseeable future, it needs to keep growing both the top and bottom lines. This is clearly not the case currently and is perhaps the reason why management is not increasing the dividend.STX has a dividend strength score of 72 / 100.So, whilst I consider the dividend to be safe in terms of generated cash and earnings, I do not see much potential for dividend growth until the company returns to more stable earnings growth.Focusing only on dividends is a mistake which many dividend investors have made in the past. While companies which pay stable and growing dividends usually fare quite well, one would be foolish to not look closely at the fundamentals.Four main factors dictate stock performance: value, momentum, financial strength & earnings quality.I look at these factors separately and jointly to assess the quality of the company which I’m considering investing in.Put plainly, undervalued stocks fare better than overvalued stocks. Value can be quantitively assessed by looking at ratio such as P/E, P/S, P/CFO & Shareholder Yield. Depending on the stock’s ratios, I assign it a value score out of 100.STX's value ratios are: According to these values, STX is more undervalued than 97% of stocks, which is extremely satisfying.Value Score: 97 / 100Furthermore, I like to draw PE Lines over the stock chart, like Peter Lynch used to do back in his day. Doing so gives investors an idea of the stock's valuation range as a multiple of earnings.Source: mad-dividends.comAs you can see, STX is currently trading at a price below its average price earnings. This implies that the market is not convinced about STX’s growth prospects.The trend is your friend. Many investors mistakenly believe that buying trending stocks is reserved to growth investors.Believing this, I feel is a grave mistake. Since stocks which have been going down will likely continue to go down, and those which are going up are more likely to continue to increase, one could argue that purchasing on the way down generally isn’t the best strategy.Seagate Technology PLC trades at $46.07 and is up 5.52% these last 3 months, 8.12% these last 6 months but is down 20.98% over the last 12 months. It does not compare favourably with the S&P500. This shows that it has under-performed the market and due to its recent lack lustre earnings history is likely to continue to do so.Source: mad-dividends.comThis gives it better momentum than 47% of stocks, which puts it in the lower half of stocks based upon momentum. It has under-performed the market and the recent pull back is indicative of market nervousness concerning its upcoming earnings release.Momentum score: 47/ 100Company’s which are financially sound don’t need to increase their leverage dramatically; they also produce high amounts of cashflow in relation to their liabilities.They also tend to outperform those which are not financially sound. Furthermore, rapid increase in leverage might indicate problems down the line, especially for dividend investors.STX has a Debt/Equity ratio of 3.5, which is better than only 24% of stocks. The company’s liabilities have decreased by 11% over the course of the last 12 months. The company’s operating cashflow can cover 27.7% of liabilities.Overall, this makes STX more financially sound than 78% of U.S. listed stocks.Financial Strength Score: 78/100The decrease in liabilities is a pleasant surprise but the debt equity ratio is very high when compared to the Technology sector average.Do you know what can really mess with your analysis of a stock? Shady Management. You wouldn’t believe how easy it is to influence earnings through accounting shenanigans.Companies which have high quality earnings will have low levels of accruals, will depreciate assets quickly and will have high quality assets which produce lots of revenue.STX has a Total Accruals to Assets ratio of -20.9%, which is better than 79% of companies.It depreciates 117.7% of its capital expenditure each year, which is better than 52% of stocks. Finally, each dollar of assets generates $1.3 in revenue, which is better than 82% of stocks. This makes STX’s earnings quality better than 91% of stocks.Earnings Quality Score: 91 / 100When combining the different factors of the stocks profile, we get a stock strength score of 98 / 100 which is excellent.The stock maybe near the top overall it is hurt by the price momentum.With a dividend strength score of 73 & a stock strength of 98, Seagate Technology PLC looks like a good choice for dividend investors. The dividend is safe but has no history of recent growth. With revenues and earnings growth sending mixed signals this looks unlikely to change anytime soon. So, from a dividend growth perspective I would not recommend STX.From an income point of view, the 5.4% dividend looks attractive and safe. With earnings for the 1st quarter due to be released on the 30 th April and the recent pull back, Seagate looks extremely undervalued compared to the rest of the market. However investors might want hold back from investing until the stock's momentum improves. Only consider investing in Seagate if dividend growth is not important to you.Enjoyed this article?

The well-known maker of internal and external data solutions that range from hard drives to solid state drives to data recovery services has experienced a significant decline in both sales and profitability as a result of severe macro pressures. As these pressures likely won't dissipate in 2019, the company has taken up new initiatives and continues to innovate at the product level, creating ample growth opportunities. Throw in a 5.3% dividend yield and this stock becomes quite attractive after a lackluster performance in the last six months.Source: FortuneThe company has clear growth drivers for years to come and the vitality of its product suite really should resonate with investors. In the operating environment, the company has a positive trajectory as the more data (for what the company refers to as the ""Global DataSphere"" grows), the higher the demand for their products. The demand curve only looks to be improving based upon the company's projections, with a real inflection in the growth rate for data after the 2020 mark, seen below.Source: Investor PresentationOne statistic particularly intrigues me in that over the next four years, the storage shipments that occur will represent the entire amount of shipments in the last twenty years. That's absolutely staggering to think about and the growth continues to deliver. This is predominately centered on demand for HDD, which represents about 60% of the growth, while SSD and non-volatile memory make up another 30%. Tape and Optical memory fill the remainder. Essentially, as more and more users come online, through a variety of access points, more and more storage is needed.Source: Investor PresentationAll of this paints a rosy picture for Seagate, but revenues are down $800 million on a YOY basis, from $11.2 billion to $10.4 billion. Additionally, the gross margin has contracted 200 bps in the same time frame, and earnings have fallen about 14% YOY. Yet, the company has shipped more HDD capacity, up 9 exabytes (""EB"") YOY to 347 EB, and operating cash flow has contracted by 15%. What can investors attribute the weak earnings profile, as of late, to?One quote that I found to be interesting from the latest earnings call, from Seagate President and CEO William Mosley, concerned the buying patterns of customers.It's interesting to see how high level this is. The lack of business confidence is having a very real impact on Seagate's business and has driven the core weakness in both sales and profitability. This provides two key takeaways. First, a trade deal or truce for an extended period of time will allow for an uptick in business confidence, which will drive incremental sales growth for the company. Second, investors have to be very careful owning a stock like this, despite the yield to protect against some losses, as the macro is clearly having a very tangible impact. Should the earnings profile of Seagate deteriorate further, then valuation begins to look more and more unreasonable, pushing away a class of investors who were first interested in the stock because of attractive multiples.Source: OECDI want to note that the company isn't without levers to pull to drive growth. The company is actively changing its business mix more towards growth markets like enterprise nearline drives, edge storage, and cloud system solutions. While it likely won't be able to make up the entirety of losses in the short term that the dent in business confidence has caused, it's reassuring to know that management has a plan in place to stem the losses. These are also higher gross margin businesses and the company expects margin expansion as the pivot develops.In the near-term, investors should pay close attention to the 16 TB drives that the company is shipping. These drives saw shipments begin back in March, but the real test of their resonance with customers will come in the next couple of months, when Seagate expects to be shipping them in high volumes. Additionally, it's critical that these are well-received as the company expects to be the first in the industry to ship 20 TB drives which utilizes their unique HAMR technology. These won't see shipments until the end of 2020 (calendar, not fiscal), but will help to provide another consistent revenue stream. If business confidence is still as weak as it currently is this time next year, then this helps to provide some insulation.The dividend seems to be the primary differentiating factor of this stock relative to peers, with a current yield of 5.43%. At more than double the broader market rate, this is a substantial return of capital to shareholders. In fact, this is a company that has returned $5.6 billion worth of capital to shareholders since FY16, which includes 66 million shares bought back. That's exactly what you want to see when evaluating a stock that's prone to a considerable amount of volatility, which stems from an ever-changing macro environment.My largest concern when it comes to companies like this is that the yield may not be supported by cash flow and its potential developments in the near-term, as well as the valuation may be too high as investors reach for yield. The company currently has $2.22 billion in cash relative to $4.25 billion in debt, for a net debt balance of $2.03 billion. Free cash flow this past quarter was $297 million, with the LTM balance at $1.16 billion. With fiscal 2019 having come to a close this past quarter, the company has paid $713 million in dividends. That means free cash flow after dividends amounts to about $400 million. That's a yield of 3%. If viewed net of dividends, that free cash flow yield improves to about 10%. So long as the company isn't burning cash while it waits for the macro pressures to go away, I don't have an issue with the current dividend policy.This, coupled with the current buyback program, is driven by a management team that wants to provide shareholders with a quality return. Management hasn't been all that active in buying back shares since the latest authorization was announced back in October 2018. The company authorized then $2.3 billion worth of shares to be bought back, and as of the latest quarter end, $2.2 billion in capacity remained under that authorization. Considering the company isn't cash-strapped, there's absolutely room for improvement to buy back stock here, and I'd expect management to be more active should macro pressures intensify in the last few months of 2019.Source: StockChartsSeagate has a very unique position and proprietary technology across multiple suites that will enable higher margin growth in quarters to come. With that being said, the company is at the will of the macro environment, to an extent, as a lack of business confidence has driven both revenue and earnings lower by a significant magnitude. With the company doing what it can to offset these external pressures, shareholders are getting paid to wait with a yield in excess of 5% and a large buyback authorization that can be put to use should shares head lower. This seems to be a high quality portfolio addition in a highly volatile space."
4243291,105057,2019-02-22T10:42:38-05:00,"The storage devices industry is experiencing a near-term downturn.
        Seagate has strived in previous years to transform the company product mix to challenges ahead.
        These recent years tells us a story of improved execution through operational efficiencies and cost discipline, backed by a healthy balance sheet.
        The storage products most exposed to Solid-State Drive challenges have shrunk significantly, as Seagate pivoted away from the low-capacity HDDs, and it´s also showing SSD innovative strength, and so, four of its six brand new flagship drives are SSD products.
        We consider any price below the $43 ceiling as a good entry point, and below $40 a very compelling buy.","The storage devices industry is experiencing a near-term demand downturn, reflected in the last quarterly earnings posted by main leader companies. Western Digital (WDC), more exposed to the decline in NAND flash prices, reported revenues down 21% YoY and gross profit down 48% YoY. In contrast to its principal rival, Seagate Technology (STX) revenues declined only by 7% YoY, and gross profit by 9.5% YoY, due to less exposure to the SSD drive market.Seagate´s revenue decline was principally due to price erosion and the decrease in exabytes shipped. Also, its gross margin came in at 29.2% down from 30.5% sequentially, driven by the deterioration in the nearline volumes sold.Source: Data from company filings.We detect a sudden halt both in capacity shipped and in nearline demand. Nearline applications comprise those which require high capacity and energy efficient storage solutions, like storage for cloud computing, content delivery, and backup services; in contrast with the mission-critical segment, comprising applications that are vital to the operations of large-scale enterprise workloads, requiring high performance, an area where SSDs are a no-brainer winner.Is in the nearline segment where HDDs offered by Seagate boast better features to fend off SSD competition, at least, as long as the HDD prices remain well below SSD ones; thus it´s ugly to see this faint figures, from the top Q4 2018 44.5 exabytes shipped to this Q2 2019 33 exabytes, down 22%.Surprisingly, mission-critical shipments made an uptick to 3.4 exabytes this quarter, up 13% sequentially. Consumer segment sustained its steady growth touching 14.2 exabytes, up 27% sequentially. The shipments of consumer electronics made up of surveillance, DVR, NAS, and gaming use cases also turned lower to 18.4 exabytes, 21% less than the previous quarter. Meanwhile, desktop and notebook segment holds in a flat trend.Since revenues topped at $14.9 billion in 2012, the company has failed to grow its top line every year.Source: Data from 10-k filings.In 2015, the management realized that a significant change in its strategy must be made to get ahead. Hence Seagate sought inorganic growth by the acquisition of Xyratex and LSI´s flash business. These additions should have helped it to offset the slow collapse of the PC business by diversifying in external storage (Xyratex) and strengthen its storage solutions with PCIe flash and SSD capabilities (LSI) for the growing flash market. At least it helped to stop the bleeding making 2015 a flat year with revenues of $13.7 billion in line with 2014 numbers.In 2016, and 2017 fiscal years Seagate dug deeply in its transformation efforts, doing a whole restructuration to go leaner and streamlining its manufacturing costs, reducing it´s workforce by 4,600 employees in 2016, 6,800 in 2017, and 1,100 in 2018, recording restructuring costs of $175 million, $178 million, and $89, respectively.However, in the year 2016 Seagate suffered the sharpest decline in revenues of the decade, falling by 19% to $11.1 billion, as a result of a decrease in shipments by 43 million units and price erosion, which were due to lower demand in the client computer market and reduced demand for mission-critical HDD drives. That year made them change its approach pushing aside lower capacity HDDs and aim for nearline application; and instead of exposing itself to the cyclical NAND market it strived to sell higher capacity HDDs to cloud and enterprise customers, which prefer cheaper HDDs over pricier SSDs with fewer storage capacities.As it´s been seen in the first chart, Seagate succeeded in meeting nearline demand, realizing explosive growth in exabyte shipped from 12.2 in Q1 2016 to the top 44.5 in Q4 2018.In spite of the growth in capacity dispatched, this industry is characterized by pricing declines for disc drives with comparable capacity and performance, as HDDs rapidly become a commodity product. Hence, 2017 registered another drop in revenues to $10.8 billion due to price erosion, albeit gross margin recovered from 23.4% to 29.5%, thanks to improved factory utilization resulting from cost savings due to the workforce reductions and manufacturing consolidation.The silver lining was the year 2018 returning to growth, gaining 4% in revenues to $11.2 billion due to higher demand in high capacity HDD products.I think all this process lived in the past five years is very insightful because it tells a lot about operational execution, adaptation to changes in demand trends, and cost discipline to maintain projected margin ranges. The year 2016 was very challenging, but through operational efficiencies, we arrived at the last TTM figures with a stable gross margin of 30.5% within the company´s long-term margin range of 29% to 33%. From 2016 to current ttm numbers, Seagate has reduced its cost of revenue from $8.5 billion to $7.9 billion; its product development cost, from $1.2 billion to $1 billion and its marketing and administrative cost, from $635 million to $510 million. All this to stabilize operating margin, from 4% in 2016 to 16% ttm.Seagate enjoys a strong cash position ended this last quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, that gives it a working capital ratio of 1.6x. It also boasts well-laddered debt maturities with no debt come due until 2022, for a resulting net debt of $2.97 billion, just 1.4x net debt to EBITDA ratio. Source: Data from 10-k filings.This conservative balance sheet gives Seagate financial flexibility to endure economic contraction periods and fuel growth investing in the development of its technology and through acquisitions. The company has a history of smart approach in its capital allocation policy as it´s seen in its pretty consistent ROIC ratio of the last years, becoming stronger after the weak 2016 year.Source: Data from 10-k filings.The last share price around $46 and a dividend of $2.52 a share, provide a juicy yield of 5.5%, higher than the sector average. Seagate didn´t raise its dividend since the 2017 fiscal year and instead focused its efforts to invest in the company restructuring actions and improved its products mix.The Dividend cost has been well covered over time, being only between 30%-40% of free cash flow, except for the year 2016 when it exceeded 67%. The management has the target of keeping its shareholder payouts in the range of 30% to 50% cash flow from operations, so we are within these edges. Source: Data from 10-k filings.I consider the dividend quite safe because the underlying cause of dividend cuts are often excessive leverage, so any reductions in revenues could lead to liquidity issues to meet the lender's obligations. As its low financial leverage mitigates Seagate's risks, I don´t see dividend cuts risks in the near term. Its worth to mention that the company also has heavily invested in its stock for the last six years, lowering the outstanding diluted shares from 441 million at the end of 2012 to current 287 million, 35% less free float, diminishing the dividend burden hence.It´s evident that SSDs has arrived to disrupt the market, they are newer, vastly faster, much smaller than HDDs and therefore offer manufacturers more flexibility in designing devices. While HDDs until now only provide a considerably cheaper cost.However, the price of NAND memory (the primary type of flash memory used within SSD memory chips) has fallen considerably over the last year and is projected to continue doing so, making SSDs available to a broader range of consumers.So long as Seagate can keep increasing capacity fast enough then they will retain a cost/GB advantage over SSDs, but in the chart below we see a dramatic decline in SSD prices in recent years, and HDD prices can´t keep coming down forever, so there will be a time when this gap closes, and these lines come together.The industry was aware that the traditional PMR technology (Perpendicular Magnetic Recording) used in HDD´s manufacture had reached the available limit in terabytes per inch (areal density). So it was required to develop a new recording system which enables hard drives to keep competitive areal density and capacity growth relative to NAND, maintaining its advantages in cost per TB and total cost of ownership (NYSE:TCO).Here appears the HAMR technology (Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording), with which Seagate claims it will be capable of build HDDs up to 20TB by 2020 and 40TB or higher by 2023; they also envision the future combination of HAMR with BPMR (Bit Patterned Media Recording) technology, to improve further areal density growth.On the SSD front, they are also showing innovative strength, and so, four of its six brand new flagship drives are SSD products, aimed at the gaming market with FireCuda® 510 and BarraCuda® 510, at the NAS market with IronWolf® 110, and at the external storage market with LaCie Mobile SSD line products. Also, in June 2018 it completed the $1.27 billion investment in Bain Capital Private acquisition of Toshiba Memory Corporation, so Seagate should be benefited from the long-term access to NAND supply at favorable costs from TMC.So it´s not like they can´t make SSD drives nor Seagate has become Kodak-like company selling out-of-date products. Its more like Seagate didn´t give up its expertise and leadership in hard drives, and instead of leaping on SSDs technology, it has taken a more conservative path expanding this technology to high standards as we have seen with latest SSD products, but restraining the volumes until prices are appealing enough to ramp up the production. In this regard in the last September earnings call, the management commented on the following:The most significant risk for Seagate´s business is its revenue concentration; thus an accelerated decrease in demand for HDD could be very disruptive for its business. There already are some SSD drives that couple with its intrinsic high-performance, it also reaches large capacities up to 100TB like the Nimbus100TB / 50TB ExaDrive DC series or Toshiba PM5 with 30.72TB, but the roaring question is when will this high capacity SSDs prices become genuinely competitive?According to Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers on the Open Compute Project summit, last year:For now, while we forecast Seagate's revenue growth will be restrained by declining HDDs unit sales as a result of the competitive displacement by SSD, the storage products most exposed to these challenges have shrunk significantly, as it pivoted away from the low-capacity HDDs. The product mix shift toward higher value nearline HDDs, joined with the significant cost restructuring undertaken over the last three years support our standpoint.In an IDC’s report, Data Age 2025, sponsored by Seagate, it predicts worldwide data creation will grow from 36ZB (zettabytes) in 2018 to 163ZB by 2025. It´s expected that 59% of the data will still be on hard drives, but what is more revealing is that 30% of data is forecasted to be ""real-time"" in 2025, and in this field is where SSD boasts its most notable edge. Seagate´s management is well aware of this trend so, in September earnings call it was commented that:The management believes that we are through short-lived demand headwinds, a digestion period in cloud service and enterprise customers, plus some issues for some small end customers like parts shortages and liquidity concerns. However, they remained optimistic with the expectation that exabyte growth will resume in the second half of the year. Sure this downturn will test its sustained operational performance and the resilience of the company through fluctuations in demand.On a PER basis, Seagate is trading at roughly 8x earnings or 9.6x if we take the average EPS estimate of $4.76 for 2020, somewhat above its main competitors. Albeit the modest valuation multiple, we think that more diversification in the revenues stream is required to justify multiple expansion. We expect over time a more balanced portfolio between HHDs and SSD product lines.Running our DCF analysis, we take the following assumptions:The company is guiding revenues in the March quarter in the range of $2.3 billion plus or minus 5%; that means around -18% YoY decline or -15% sequentially, as is expected nearline demand remains soft. Analysts also expect revenues of $2.3 billion for the June quarter, and an average of $10.34 billion for the 2019 year, -7.5% YoY and $10.09 billion for 2020, -2.4% YoY. We take the lower end of the 29%-33% gross margin range noted by the company. They aimed at 13%-15% operating expenses, so we choose the higher end. Regarding capital expenditures, they target a long-term range of 6% to 8% of revenue, historically it was lower, so we accept an average of 7%.We´d hold a conservative approach in our estimates, so we select a range between 2.5% to 3% of terminal growth rate because of the risks commented before. Though we highlight the last years' proper operational execution and gives us confidence in the great prospects of the company, there are specific challenges ahead Seagate will have to address with a solid performance.We consider any price below the $43 ceiling as a good entry point, and below $40 a very compelling buy for capital appreciation while taking a juicy dividend."
4238263,103480,2019-02-05T14:33:30-05:00,"Like most of its peers in the memory sector, Seagate Technology is undergoing a period of stagnation due to slowing memory demand.The company’s top line declined in Q2, just barely hitting Wall Street’s targets.Gross margins also saw a notable contraction thanks to declines in memory pricing.As a percentage of revenues, Seagate’s enterprise segment also is in decline, indicating weakness in datacenter usage.","No single company can defy trends in a broader industry stagnation, and Seagate Technology’s (STX) second quarter results reflected the same weakness in memory demand as Western Digital’s (WDC) own results a few weeks back. Though Seagate Technology’s far greater mix of hard drive products (which have more stable demand relative to flash) has protected the company from too much downside, the results still fell flat in investors’ eyes. Shares of Seagate fell 5% in after-hours trading after the Q2 print. Year to date, however, Seagate is still up by more than 20%:Data by YChartsIn my view, there are plenty of weaknesses in Seagate’s results that prevent me from being too bullish on the stock, especially in light of a strong year-to-date rally. One of the biggest factors driving Seagate’s success, in particular, is enterprise demand. Seagate’s specialization in cheaper hard drive storage makes it an attractive storage for companies that are piling up hordes of data. Much of this data can remain static in “cold storage,” and so cheap hard drives are the most efficient storage option.This thesis played out well for Seagate in 2018. But in 2019, that trajectory seems a little bit frayed. The below chart, taken from Seagate’s Q2 earnings deck, showcases the trends in its HDD business. Notice that enterprise as a percentage of revenues has fallen to 39% - down three points sequentially (and lower than most of FY18), while also falling one point year-over-year.Figure 1. Seagate HDD trendsSource: Seagate Q2 earnings deckNote that Western Digital echoed similar results in its own earnings release, with the company showing weaker near-term datacenter demand. Similar warnings are sounding off across the tech industry: As companies brace for a global economic slowdown, investment in IT (particularly hardware) may shrink.As evidenced by the charts above, enterprise is a huge portion of Western Digital’s revenue, as well as its margins. If enterprise/datacenter demand is slackening, Seagate’s declining trends could continue far into FY19.Despite these challenges, Seagate still trades at a steep premium to its memory peers. Both Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Western Digital trade at lower P/E multiples, plus both of these companies have large buybacks outstanding that have the capacity to buy back huge portions of their market caps.Data by YChartsWhat sense is there, then, in investing in Seagate - which largely faces the same challenges as these cheaper stocks? In my view, investors who are wanting to bet on the memory sector should choose Micron or Western Digital. Seagate, on the other hand, looks overvalued for its many cyclical challenges.Here’s a look at Seagate’s Q2 results:Figure 2. Seagate 2Q19 resultsSource: Seagate Q2 earnings releaseSeagate barely made estimates this quarter. Revenues declined by -7% y/y to $2.715 billion, in line with Wall Street's expectations. To put this into perspective, however - in Western Digital's most recent quarter, revenues declined by -21% y/y. The company blamed primarily NAND flash, however to which Seagate has minimal exposure.What's also interesting is the fact that exabyte shipments remained relatively flat year over year. As seen in the chart below, the company shipped 87.4 exabytes this quarter, barely unchanged from 87.5 exabytes in the year-ago quarter (though sharply down from both Q1 and Q2), so the majority of the revenue decline came on pricing weakness.Figure 3. Seagate exabyte shipment trendsSource: Seagate Q2 earnings deckWe can see corroborating evidence of the ASP declines in Seagate's gross margin as well:Figure 4. Seagate margin trendsSource: Seagate Q2 earnings deckAs seen in the trend tables above, Seagate's pro forma gross margins dipped to 29.7% - down 70bps on a year-over-year basis and down about a point and a half from the trailing-twelve-month average.There are, of course, puts and takes here. The gross margin decline is being felt across the industry. We again can take Western Digital as the closest compare (note that Micron has not posted its earnings yet this season) - Western Digital's gross margins fell by 12 points in the most recent quarter, but again that's due to the company's greater exposure to flash. In addition, Seagate was able to get ahead of its down cycle by slimming down on operating expenses.On a year-over-year basis, Seagate managed to drop pro forma operating expenses by -7% y/y to $365 million - matching the revenue decline. Were it not for the gross margin weakness, operating margins would have remained flat. Note also that Seagate's bottom line management came in ahead of Wall Street's expectations - pro forma net income dipped by -6% y/y to $405 million, but EPS came in at $1.41 - representing 11% upside to Wall Street's consensus of $1.27.Free cash flow, however, suffered in this quarter. Capex levels remained largely consistent, while operating cash flows decline heavily. Total free cash flows in the quarter dipped to $161 million - less than a quarter of the prior-year compare, and the worst performance within a two-year stretch.Figure 5. Seagate FCFSource: Seagate Q2 earnings deckOne of the most compelling reasons to invest in Seagate vs. other memory peers is its relatively high dividend. At current share prices, Seagate is still yielding ~5.5%. The question of dividend maintenance, however, comes to the fore: If Seagate's FCF is under pressure, will management eventually sacrifice the dividend payout? For the moment, Seagate has maintained its $0.63/quarter payout. But if push comes to shove and Seagate is forced to forgo its dividend, there will be incredible selling pressure on the stock.There's no doubt that Seagate's ""safer"" exposure to hard drives has allowed it to execute much better than its memory peers in the face of a sharp downturn in memory prices. A bit of a valuation premium is warranted to Seagate for its relatively mild revenue and profit declines.However, we have to be wary of the risks that face this stock. Like all memory companies, it's facing a revenue crunch that's hitting free cash flow hard - which, in turn, may threaten Seagate's generous dividend. With that in mind, I'm much more inclined to invest in Seagate's cheaper memory cousins rather than bank on a stock that already had a good run so far in 2019."

Companies with strong free cash flow provide higher quality and safer dividend yields because we know they have the cash to support the dividend. We think this portfolio provides a uniquely well-screened group of stocks that can help clients outperform.Seagate Technology (STX) is the featured stock in May's Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio.Since 2016, STX has grown after-tax operating profit (NOPAT) by an impressive 68% compounded annually. Over the trailing twelve months, NOPAT has grown 16% year-over-year. NOPAT margin has increased from 5% in 2016 to 15% TTM while return on invested capital (ROIC) has improved from 8% to a top-quintile 23% over the same time.Figure 1: STX Profitability Since 2016Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsOver the past five years, STX has increased its annual dividend from $1.67/share to $2.52/share, or 11% compounded annually. This dividend payment has been supported by STX's cumulative free cash flow. Despite lower FCF in the TTM period, STX generated cumulative $6.3 billion (53% of market cap) in FCF since 2014 while paying $3.2 billion in dividends.Companies with strong free cash flow provide higher quality dividend yields because we know the firm has the cash to support its dividend. On the flip side, dividends from companies with low or negative free cash flow cannot be trusted as much because the company may not be able to sustain paying dividends.Figure 2: STX's FCF vs. Dividends Since 2014Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsAt its current price of $43/share, STX has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.7. This ratio means the market expects STX's NOPAT to permanently decline by 30%. This expectation seems pessimistic given that STX has grown NOPAT by 7% compounded annually since 2003.If STX can maintain TTM NOPAT margins (15%) and grow NOPAT by just 1% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth $57/share today - a 33% upside. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.As investors focus more on fundamental research, research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings. Below are specifics on the adjustments we make based on Robo-Analyst findings in Seagate Technology's 2018 10-K:Income Statement: we made $570 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $494 million in non-operating expense (4% of revenue). See all adjustments made to STX's income statement here.Balance Sheet: we made $5.5 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of $846 million. The most notable adjustment was $2.6 billion (41% of reported net assets) related to asset write-downs. See all adjustments to STX's balance sheet here.Valuation: we made $5.5 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $3.8 billion. Apart from $4.6 billion in total debt, which includes $73 million in off-balance sheet operating leases, the largest adjustment to shareholder value was $845 million in excess cash. This cash adjustment represents 7% of STX's market value.

4230221,22742,2018-12-26T12:36:52-05:00,Why do people flock to retail stores for sales but run away when something important goes on sale?Do not panic; this is a time to think about adding shares not selling.Building your retirement the old fashioned way; layer upon layer of income streams bought on sale.,"Were stocks over valued? Yes, on the whole equity prices got ahead of where they should have been earlier in the year and a correction was warranted. But the economy is not falling apart just yet and we are not heading into a recession next quarter. So far, the S&P 500 (SPY) has fallen 20.2% from its intraday peak of 293.94 in September. The rate of decline since September has been brutal. For calendar year 2018, SPY has fallen 12.2%. Of course, neither of those numbers includes dividends which would reduce the carnage very little.Throughout history market corrections (drops of 10% but less than 20%) happen on average once per year (about once every 357 days according to Deutsche Bank). The average correction knocks 13.3% off stock prices. This one has turned into a bear market (by strict definition; using closing prices SPY has dropped 20.1%) and has been painful than the average year. But there are a few reasons for optimism within this period of gloom.The economy is still growing strongly, albeit slowing from the torrid pace of 4.1% during quarter two of this year. But there are reasons to expect good things to happen in the not-too-distant future.The National Retail Foundation is expecting one of the best holiday shopping seasons in recent memory with retail sales forecasted to increase by between 4.3% and 4.8%. Let’s not forget that consumers make up about two thirds of the economy so when we are spending the economy is growing. And when we are spending at a higher than usual rate then the economy should be growing even faster than usual. Going into this holiday week the Consumer Sentiment report from the University of Michigan came in at a strong level of 98.3 (up 0.8 from November and above expectations). The current economic conditions reading was 116.1, one of the strongest in a year. Of course, those readings could fall when (if) folks open their quarterly brokerage account statements in January. In 2017, the stock market hardly paused all year dipping only slightly. We never experienced a correction last year so it is only natural that stocks needed to consolidate those gains and take a breather this year. The market cannot go straight up forever. The current market pull back may be just making up for over exuberance in 2017. As negotiations with China progress (I hope that is the right choice of words) there should be additional significant purchases by China of U.S. produced goods to help reduce the trade imbalance. China made a purchase of 1.5 million tons of soybeans this past week, the first since the trade war between the two began. As part of the trade truce agreed to by Presidents Trump and Xi last week, China agreed to purchase a significant amount of U.S. goods over the 90-day period of extended negotiations. Such major purchases can’t hurt the economy in the short run. And if a settlement can be reached by the end of the first quarter of 2019, the markets could rebound nicely.Of course, you can find articles that call the initial soybean purchase “just a drop in the bucket” but it is, nevertheless, a big drop and just the first of two already agreed upon by the two sides. Those two purchases will amount to about 10% of all soybean exports from the U.S. to everywhere for a year.On the other side of the coin, this could be the beginning of a much larger fall in stock prices. There is no denying that possibility. Trade negotiations are in play but there is nothing definitive yet, so I expect that the downside from trade issues is limited until something new breaks into the headlines. The government shutdown is being played as a death knell but we should all know by now that the government will only shut down non-essential operations like national parks. Social Security and other welfare checks and transfers will not get delayed. Treasury is not likely to miss making any interest payments. The impact on the economy should be minimal but the media will claim it’s the end of the world. So, what other events are coming that could bring down the economy? Black swans, maybe, but nothing about which we already know. So, one could argue that the worst case known scenario is already baked into the market.Even if that is not the case, it may be time to consider adding a little of this and a little of that (starter positions) and averaging down if the market does, in fact, go lower. This is the time to look for bargains on the quality stocks with strong future growth potential. Why pay full price?This is something I have never been able to understand. When cars go on sale more people buy cars. When a clothing store announces 30% off everything people flock to the stores and buy like crazy. When stocks go down those same people sell at rock bottom prices. This is nuts! It is the exact opposite of what we should be doing.I realize that people fear the worst when things turn painful; it is human nature to run away rather than endure more pain. I think that’s called self preservation. But investing is for a lifetime not just this next month or year. The market goes up and down. Buy low and sell high. So, why do people do the opposite and buy when stocks are highly priced then sell after a market correction, or worse after a crash? I just don’t understand it and all I can say is: Thank you!Because I love sales, especially when I am buying something that I have always wanted to own like shares of a great company with excellent future growth prospects and a rising dividend. So, the reaction of the lemmings in the market has always escaped my understanding. Now, trying to catch the exact bottom is a fool’s game so I just try to buy the stocks of companies I want to own for the long term whenever those share prices have fallen to what I consider to be a bargain (or 33% below my estimated intrinsic value).Or, at least, the way I think is right. I aim to add streams of future income, layer upon layer, over time. But I only like to own companies of the highest quality. That is why I focus on companies that consistently produce superior results, year after year. Of course I also like companies that are likely to continue to do well in the future, those with a sustainable competitive advantage or the proven ability to adapt to the changing business environment.One of the companies I have my eye on is Seagate Technology (STX), the world’s largest manufacturer of hard disk drives for digital storage of information. The company is in a cyclical industry and, thus, it behooves investors to wait for the stock to tumble in order to capture good value. The dividend is currently $0.63 per quarter which represents a 7.9% annual compounded rate of increase over the past five years. STX does not raise the dividend every year but when it does increase the dividend the increase is usually a healthy boost. Current yield is 6.9% and well covered. Ten years ago the dividend was $0.12 per quarter, for perspective, which represents an increase of 425%, or and increase of over 18% compounded annually. While I don’t expect that pace again any time soon, I think the average of 7% or 8% a year will suit my needs and is much more sustainable.I should take a moment to caution dividend investors about Seagate’s dividend history. In the last down cycle (2016) the company held the dividend steady, but there have been times, like during the financial crisis of 2008-09 when the company skipped paying the dividend for a few quarters to conserve cash for operations. I don’t like that either, but since the company has improved its cash flow in recent years I expect that a flat dividend to be more likely than a temporary elimination. But, if things get really bad, anything is possible so be forewarned. The key is that the company has been able to weather each storm in the past and come back more strongly each time. And each time the dividend eventually rises with the average compounded increase being very tempting.Now let’s look at the numbers and see what our algorithm tells us about Seagate.In analyzing Seagate Technology, we will present some unique ratios that our Friedrich Investing System uses along with a real-time quantitative analysis that will demonstrate the power of free cash flow in the investment process. In doing so, we will also show readers how to analyze one's own portfolio holdings on Main Street vs. Wall Street.Main Street is where Seagate Technology operates and Wall Street is where its shares trade. The Seagate Technology shares that one can purchase on Wall Street are in the public domain, and the company has little control over how each share will trade. Seagate Technology is required to release its earnings report each quarter and, from time to time, it also provides press releases with updates on how its operations are doing on Main Street.Main Street is where Seagate Technology invests in its own operations and sells to its customers. How well the CEO of Seagate Technology and its management do in selling those products determines how profitable the company will be. Wall Street then reacts based on the success or failure of management to meet its goals. Main Street and Wall Street are thus interlinked, but because anyone with a computer (or even just a smart phone), an internet connection, and a brokerage account can buy or sell any stock at any time, expertise is not a requirement in order to invest on Wall Street.The result is that Wall Street can be a very dangerous place for retail investors who tend to invest through emotion or follow the herd in and out of stocks. During bull markets, investors feel like they can do no wrong as ""the rising tide lifts all boats."" But when a bear market suddenly shows up, these same investors tend to panic. Thus, we have the classic case of ""greed vs. panic"" and the irrational behavior I alluded to earlier.Having noticed this problem some 30 years ago, Mycroft spent the last three decades building an algorithm called Friedrich. His algorithm was designed to assist all investors (both Pro and Novice alike) and give them the ability to quickly compare a company's Main Street operations, to its Wall Street valuation (Overbought or Oversold condition). Friedrich can do this on an individual company basis or assist users in analyzing an entire index like the S&P 500, an ETF, Mutual Fund, or individual portfolio with the use of our Portfolio Analyzer. We recently did so when we compared Apple ( AAPL) to the S&P 500 Index ( SPY) Apple Vs. The S&P 500: Which Is The Better Investment?Many years ago, while reading Berkshire Hathaway's ( BRK.A) ( BRK.B) 1986 letter to shareholders, he discovered a ratio, which Mr. Buffett entitled ""Owner Earnings,"" or what we may consider to be Mr. Buffett's version of ""Free Cash Flow."" Amazingly, in that little footnote, Mr. Buffett explains how to use it and basically states that it is one of the key ratios that he and Charlie Munger used in analyzing stocks. In that article, he defined the term ""owner earnings"" as the cash that is generated by the company's business operations.""[Owner earnings] represent [A] reported earnings plus [B] depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges… less [C] the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume.""We have used this free cash flow ratio for decades, using data from the Value Line Investment Survey, whose founder was Arnold Bernhard. Mr. Bernhard was a big fan of free cash flow and probably introduced it sooner than Mr. Buffett did. We know this as Mycroft was able to calculate the FCF ratio using old Value Line's sheets for his 60-year backtest of the DJIA from 1950 to 2009.In the backtest mentioned above, Mycroft demonstrated that if one can purchase a company whose shares are selling for 15 times or less its Price to Free Cash Flow Ratio that the probability of success will dramatically increase in most cases. He has renamed the ratio the Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio in honor of both men. The following is how that ratio is calculated.Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor / [(net income per share + depreciation per share) - (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding))The above are the ratios we use when analyzing a stock on Wall Street, and below are the ratios we use when analyzing a stock on Main Street.FROIC means ""Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital""Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) - (Capital Spending)]FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/(Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)What the FROIC ratio does is tell us how much forward free cash flow the company is generating on Main Street relative to how much total capital it has employed. So, if a company invests $100 in total capital on Main Street and generates $20 in forward free cash flow, it, therefore, has a FROIC of 20%, which we consider excellent. This is just one of the key ratios (66 in total) that we use to identify how a company is performing on Main Street, as it is our belief that if a company is making a killing on Main Street that this news will eventually show up on Wall Street's radar.Before we get into the analysis of Main Street versus Wall Street for STX we first need to explain our treatment of debt and how we adjust for excessive use of leverage.A major concern that we have these days in analyzing companies is the amount of debt taken on relative to operations and whether management is abusing this situation by accumulating more debt than it requires. Debt, when used wisely, allows for what is called leverage, and leverage can be extremely beneficial within certain parameters. On the other side of the coin, the use of debt can also be excessive and put a company's future in jeopardy. So, what we have done to determine if a company's debt policy is beneficial or abusive is to create the Sherlock Debt Divisor.What the Divisor does is punish companies that use debt unwisely and rewards those who successfully use debt as leverage. How do we do this? Well, we start with a company's working capital and subtract its long-term debt. If a company has a lot more working capital than long-term debt, we reward it and punish those whose long-term debt exceeds its working capital. So, if this resulting Sherlock Debt Divisor is higher than the current stock market price, then leverage is being used and the more leveraged a company is, the worse the results of this ratio will be and, subsequently, the less attractive its stock will be as an investment.Thus, having successfully explained our use of the Sherlock Debt Divisor, we need the following four bits of financial data in order to calculate it for Seagate Technology. TTM (trailing 12 months) is as close to real-time data as we can get without adding assumptions and based on when each company reports.Market Price Per Share = $36.13Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $4,520,000,000Total Current Liabilities = $3,170,000,000Working Capital = $1,350,000,000Long-Term Debt = $4,320,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 292,000,000 (decreased by 7 million shares since 2017)Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/(Diluted Shares Outstanding))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $36.13 - (($1,350,000,000 - $4,320,000,000)/ 292,000,000))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $46.30Since Seagate Technology has more Long-Term Debt than Working Capital, we, therefore, must punish it and use the new $46.30 price as our new numerator in all our calculations.Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) - (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = $46.30Net Income per diluted share = $1,450,000,000/292,000,000 = $4.96Depreciation per diluted share = $571,000,000/292,000,000 = $1.95Capital Spending per diluted share = $419,000,000/292,000,000 = $1.43$4.96 + $1.95 -1.43 = $5.48Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $46.30/$5.48 = 8.45Now, if one goes to our FRIEDRICH LEGEND (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 8.45 is considered excellent.We last ran our data file for Seagate Technology on December 24, 2018, and our Friedrich Algorithm gave a recommendation to our subscribers that Seagate Technology is a ""Buy"" as our Friedrich Data File and Chart below show. There you will also find the last ten years of Seagate Technology's Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow results.Source: Ask FriedrichNow that we have shown everyone how we calculate our Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio, let us now move on and teach everyone how to calculate our FROIC ratio. FROIC means ""Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital.”This is how we calculate it:Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) + (Capital Spending)]FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/(Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)Net Income per diluted share = $1,450,000,000/292,000,000 = $4.96Depreciation per diluted share = $571,000,000/292,000,0001 = $1.95Capital Spending per diluted share = $419,000,000 /292,000,000 = $1.43Revenue Growth Rate TTM = 3.2%[(($4.96 + $1.95) (103.2%)) - ($1.43) = $5.70Long-Term Debt = $4,320,000,000Shareholders Equity = $1,850,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 292,000,000FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/ (Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)$5.70/$21.13 = 27%FROIC = 27%Now, if one goes to my FRIEDRICH LEGEND again (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 27% is an excellent result and tells us that on Main Street Seagate Technology generates $25 in forward free cash flow for every $100 it invests in total capital employed.Seagate is doing excellent on Main Street and priced at a bargain on Wall Street. Now, if one can build a portfolio concentrating on stocks that are performing this well on Main Street while also at attractive Prices to Bernhard Buffett FCF ratios, you should expect your portfolio to be a star on both Main Street and Wall Street. Finding companies that have excellent results on Main Street and Wall Street (simultaneously) these days is, unfortunately, like trying to find a needle in a haystack.Finding one that also pays a hefty dividend of almost 7% is even better! The payout ratio is about 51% and the stock sports a P/E (price to earnings) ratio of 7.3 (TTM) and 6.92 (Forward based upon consensus).To be sure, excess inventory in the supply chain could hurt revenue and earnings in the next quarter or two and we suspect that expectation is built into the current price. But beyond that the future continues to look bright for Seagate. We consider this to be a bargain but if stocks in general continue lower it could get even cheaper. So, the plan should be to add a portion of what would be a full position soon and then add more if the price drops further at intervals of maybe $3/share (or about 10% from current price). Eventually this market will turn back up and Seagate has a lot of room to grow its multiple back into at least the low double digits.Caution: it may require patience.In conclusion, it is our belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies, and my hope is that you may add these ratios to your own investor toolbox in order to help you in your own due diligence.

4240031,101850,2019-02-11T19:54:14-05:00,"Seagate’s revenue results were in line, but EPS beat consensus estimates.The EPS beat was driven by higher-than-expected gross margins, lower operating expenses, and lower interest and other expenses.However, the shift from HDDs to SSDs poses a threat to Seagate, which generates over 90% of its revenues from the sales of HDDs.But the stock has already de-rated and now trades cheaply at ~8x P/E, while offering a dividend yield of 6%.We think the market is excessively bearish on the stock, and any surprises to the upside could lead to a short squeeze.","While Seagate Technologies (STX) did post a better-than-expected quarter this time around, challenges remain. The company has been a clear beneficiary of accelerating data storage growth as enterprises adopt new technologies such as AI, IoT, and Automation, but margin recovery remains a key challenge. We see plenty of headwinds near term, e.g., cloud slowdown, Intel CPU shortages, and macro uncertainty - all of which should weigh on the top line going forward.We see the company reaching the lower end of its 29-33% gross margins target range, but a sooner-than-expected cloud demand recovery could bring GMs to the mid-point of the range. We think the key to the Seagate story in 2019 will be how management navigates margins, as tight discipline will be required to keep operating costs within the 13-15% OpEx target range.But there is a silver lining in the Seagate story - valuation. At current levels, Seagate is priced at ~8x trailing P/E, ~6x EV/ EBITDA, with a dividend yield of ~6% to boot. Thus, we think the stock might be worth a look for income investors, as HDD revenue has turned out a lot more stable than many had initially anticipated. Plus, with sentiment already very bearish on the stock (short interest is at ~11% of float), the bar is low, and we think Seagate might be ripe for a squeeze.Seagate reported revenues of $2,715 million, which were down 9% qoq and in line with consensus estimates. HDD revenues were $2,490 million, which were below estimates of $2,547 million. HDD unit shipments were 36-37 million and below consensus estimates of 37.9 million. Enterprise units sold of 8.1 million were above consensus estimates of 7.9 million. Flash and Enterprise Systems revenue was $225 million, above estimates of $190 million. Seagate shipped 87.4 exabytes this quarter in terms of storage capacity, which is down 12% qoq and flat yoy. Average capacity per drive was down from 2.5 TB in 1QFY19 to 2.4 TB. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.7%, which was above estimates of 29.3%.The company's operating EPS was $1.41, above estimates of $1.27. Despite in-line revenue results, this beat on EPS was primarily driven by higher gross margins, lower operating expenses, and lower interest and other costs.In terms of Seagate’s cash flow, cash decreased by $585 million to $1,357 million. OCF was $288 million, but CapEx was $127 million, share repurchases were $136 million, dividend payments were $180 million, and repayment of long-term debt was $499 million.The company’s guidance for 3QFY19 was below consensus estimates: revenue guidance was $2,300 million at the midpoint versus estimates of $2,500 million, and EPS guidance was $0.70 at the midpoint versus estimates of $1.04. Seagate also expects a lower gross margin for the next quarter as well as exabyte shipments to decline 10-15% qoq.As a data storage supplier, Seagate benefits from the accelerating growth in the data storage industry as a result of new technological advancements in AI, IoT, and automation. These advancements require large amounts of data, and businesses and individuals turn to data storage suppliers such as Seagate to handle them. Cloud is another area that has seen rapid growth in demand, which can also benefit the company’s business.One of the main threats to Seagate’s business is the shift away from HDD to SDD. This is a material threat to the company because it generates over 90% of its revenue from HDD. However, it can take several quarters for OEMs and Seagate’s other customers to shift purchasing decisions. Furthermore, in the face of this threat, Seagate still repurchased $136 million of its stock this quarter and paid out an additional $180 million in dividends, and management reiterated its dividend payments for the future, which currently provides a yield of 5-6%.One of the main threats to Seagate is the shift from HDD to SDD. The company generates over 90% of its revenue from its sales of HDD, and this decrease in demand for HDD could be very disruptive for its business. Seagate has reduced production of its HDD to control inventory levels, but this only addresses the issue in the short term, and the underlying long-term threat of lower HDD demand remains. Furthermore, NAND prices have also dropped, which is another catalyst for the shift from HDDs to SSDs.Seagate reported revenues that were in line with estimates and EPS that beat estimates. This was driven mainly by higher gross margins, lower operating expenses, and lower interest and other expenses. The company shipped 87.4 exabytes this quarter in terms of storage capacity, which was down 12% qoq. In addition, the average capacity per drive was down 0.1 TB qoq.As a data storage supplier, Seagate benefits from the growth of the data storage industry, spurred on by the growth of AI, IoT, automation, cloud, and other technological advancements. However, the industry has also seen a shift away from HDDs in favor of SSDs. This poses a significant threat to Seagate given that the company’s business is very concentrated, as it generates over 90% of its revenue from sales of HDDs. Seagate has reduced production of its HDDs, but this is only a temporary solution and does not address the longer-term threat that it faces.Management’s guidance for the next quarter was below consensus estimates for both the top and bottom lines, but they also reiterated their dividend guidance for the future, which currently produces a 5-6% yield. The company paid out $180 million in dividends last quarter and also bought back $136 million of its shares.Overall, we think Seagate might be worth a look for income investors - valuations are cheap at ~8x trailing P/E, and there's a nice ~6% dividend yield to boot. With the market bearish on the stock and a sky-high short interest at ~11% of the float, the bar is low, and we think Seagate might be ripe for a squeeze."
4230563,104439,2018-12-28T13:41:32-05:00,"The current price-to-book value is high in light of the market conditions.A multitude of factors are affecting the firm and its stock price.Leverage is under control, and guidance is downplayed.We should wait before we rush in just because the price is low.","Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) wouldn't be a bad buy under a price-to-book value at or under 3x with the same margin and performance stats. That's not the case right now because it is trading at a price-to-book value of 5.88x. That is still pretty given the current market conditions. As HDDs (hard disk drives) slowly fade out, Seagate will derive more of its revenues from SSDs (solid state drives), but will it have the same traction as it has in HDDs? The war can heat up sooner than we expect, and there is a large list of names in SSDs that is in a similar position. In the meantime, the inherent volatility may give the stock some ups and downs in the short run, but its stock price could fall significantly in the medium term. Sustaining a yield near 7% is not easy. Furthermore, a higher payout will mean that it will have to sacrifice its research and innovation costs. It is better to seek value elsewhere than to buy into Seagate in the current market situation, as trade tensions, high inventory levels in the industry, and pressure on ASPs (average selling prices) are causing confusion and impulsive trading behavior.Source: Seeking AlphaI feel that Seagate hasn't demonstrated anything significant that indicates that it will continue to enjoy a major share in the SSD markets. Yes, I get it, the price looks cheap, dividends are handsome, and you want a piece of it, but we must not forget that Seagate and firms alike can only survive through innovation. I expect prices of SSDs to come down significantly in the next two years, and why they shouldn't? While SSD prices go down, HDD ASPs will go down at a higher pace (due to the replacement effect). Add to that the increasing cloud preference among corporations for non-volatile memory purposes. When price disparity decreases, Seagate will suffer badly. This is a possibility if the firm doesn't focus on gaining traction on the SSD markets. Seagate has taken a cautionary look at the current pricing pressure and believes that there are other opportunities, which I think will take more time to capitalize and integrate into its products.Source: StockrowNow, if Seagate is going through a classic cyclical downtrend instead of all these pressures, then also I expect it to trade at lower prices. Before its recent peak in market cap back in July, there was a similar peak at almost same levels back in December 2014. Technical analysis on the long-term trend indicates that the steady climb down is what's happening right now, and there's potential for further decline. If you look at the price-to-book multiple, you will see that earlier in April, the market was pricing in too much value, but the level was very high compared to the last five years. What I mean is that despite the trade war and the industry issues, such a high price was already indicating to us to not get in, but people jumped in.Source: Seeking AlphaSeagate's debt levels are not problematic, yet. Seagate's net debt to last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1 times as of the September quarter. In the December quarter, the firm expects to retire the remaining November 2018 debt of approximately $499 million. The firm expects gross margins for the December quarter to be at the low end of our 29% to 33% long-term range, primarily reflecting the lower demand for nearline HDDs. Seagate's midpoint top-line guidance for the coming quarter is just slightly below its long-term average levels, and I think the firm downplayed just to be able to surprise the market.The memory market is going through some turbulent times. A myriad of technological and geopolitical challenges has put Seagate and a number of similar firms under pressure. I know many people are screaming a buy on Seagate because it is trading low, but I think there's more potential for a greater discount than the current levels. I would suggest looking for value elsewhere."

Over the trailing twelve months, NOPAT has grown 53%. Over the past 15 years, STX has grown NOPAT by 7% compounded annually. NOPAT margin has increased from 5% in 2016 to 16% TTM while return on invested capital (ROIC) has improved from 8% to a top-quintile 26% over the same time.Figure 1: STX Revenue & NOPAT Since 2016Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsEven after outperforming the market since we originally featured the stock in 2010, STX remains very cheap. At its current price of $39/share, STX has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.6. This ratio means the market expects STX's NOPAT to permanently decline by 40%. This expectation seems pessimistic given that STX has grown NOPAT by 7% compounded annually since 2003 and much faster in recent years.If STX can maintain TTM NOPAT margins (16%) and grow NOPAT by just 5% compounded annually for the next five years, the stock is worth $74/share today - a 90% upside.

TTM NOPAT is down 28%. LOCO's falling profits have been driven by margins declining from 16% in 2013 to just 6% TTM. The company's ROIC has also fallen from 10% in 2013 to a bottom-quintile 4% TTM.Figure 2: LOCO Revenue & NOPAT Since 2013Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsDespite the deterioration in fundamentals, LOCO is up 45% over the past year, which has left shares significantly overvalued.To justify its current price of $16/share, LOCO must maintain TTM NOPAT margins (6%) and grow NOPAT by 9% compounded annually for the next 11 years. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.

4220488,104099,2018-11-09T13:58:12-05:00,"Saying that this is a cyclical business is about as insightful as saying that water is wet. The point isn't that it's cyclical.More relevant, the shares trade at a discount relative to the overall market and to their own history. When investors bought at these levels in the past, they did well.For those still nervous about buying at these levels, I offer what I think is a ""win-win"" options strategy.","Over the past twelve months, the shares of Seagate Technology PLC (STX) are up about 21%. I think there’s still some upside in the shares, so I recommend that investors buy. I’ll go through my reasoning below by looking at the financial history here, and by looking at the stock itself. I’ll also recommend an option strategy for those who are nervous about owning the stock itself. In sum, I think this is a cyclical business so the stock isn’t a “buy and forget” type of investment. That said, every time investors have purchased at these levels, the shares have subsequently done quite well. I don’t say history repeats, necessarily, but it certainly rhymes, and I think that investors who buy now will be glad they did.A quick review of the financial history here indicates that this is a cyclical business. Both the top and bottom lines have swollen and fallen rather sharply over the past five years, and they both seem to be on an uptick at the moment. In addition, the growth thesis seems to be intact given that both revenue and net income are up nicely in the first quarter of FY 2019 relative to the same period a year ago. So things are volatile, but it seems like we’re on the uptick at the moment.In spite of this volatility, management has treated shareholders fairly well, which is all that I can ask of them. In particular, in just over five years, management has returned just under $8.5 billion to shareholders, with $5 billion coming in the form of stock buybacks, and the balance in the form of dividends. This combination of buybacks and dividends has resulted in dividends per share growing at a CAGR of about 8.5% since 2014.Source: Company filingsSuccessful investing is as much about paying a good price for a stream of future cash flows than anything else. Unfortunately, the shares are frequently an imperfect proxy for the value of a business, so I must spend some time talking about the stock as distinct from the business.The cyclical nature of the business becomes obvious when you look at the share price over the past few years. In my view, this stock isn’t one you hold for the long term, but it is certainly one you should consider when it trades relatively inexpensively. At the moment, I think it is quite inexpensive, as demonstrated by the following chart.Source: GurufocusLike I said, I wouldn’t suggest that history repeats, but in my view it certainly rhymes. For that reason, I think the relationship between the price paid and subsequent returns is a fairly obvious one. For your enjoyment and edification, I’ve circled the periods over the past few years when the shares were this “inexpensive” in a price to free cash flow basis. Please note that the one year returns subsequent to those times were positive, if sometimes somewhat choppy. I’d also observe that the company can certainly become cheaper on a price to free cash basis as it did through most of 2013. If it was to become that cheap again, my advice to people would simply be to “buy more.”For those who are still not convinced, or who want the opportunity to buy the shares at an even lower price, I’d recommend selling the March Puts with a strike price of $42.50. At the moment, these are bid at $2.53. In my view, selling these offers a “win-win” opportunity for investors. If the shares rise in price from here, the investor simply pockets the premium, which is not a terrible turn of events. If the shares languish from here, the investor will purchase the shares at a net price about 11% lower than the already discounted - in my view - current price.This is obviously a cyclical business, but given the valuation on the stock, it seems to me that buyers today would be accessing it near the nadir of valuations. When over the past several years the shares have been this inexpensive, they’ve gone on to perform quite well. The market may be changing, though, and some investors may wish to buy at an even greater discount. For such people, I recommend buying the puts with a strike price that would result in a purchase price about 11% below the current levels. I think price and value inevitably intersect at some point, and I think investors would be wise to buy Seagate now before price inevitably rises to match value."

4215831,67113,2018-10-30T11:49:45-04:00,Came across a screener I ran as a possible value play.Dividend yield due to the slide in the share price is almost 7%.Not enough assets on the balance sheet to spur sales growth.Staying on the sidelines.,"Seagate (STX) came across in a screener I ran where companies with strong dividend yields and positive earnings were the main criteria in the search. Furthermore, a keen valuation was obviously another requisite which we definitely have with this stock at present. Currently, Seagate trades with an earnings multiple of 9.5, a book multiple of 6.5 and a sales multiple of 1. All of these metrics looks attractive when compared to this sector on average maybe with the exception of the book multiple which looks a tad high for the data storage sector. We will research the balance sheet to see why this is the case.Seagate though is a large cap company with a market cap of almost $11 billion. The sizable drop in the share price over the past few months has spiked the dividend yield to almost 7%. This number is going to draw attention and for obvious reasons. Buying a stock for its yield though can bring its own set of problems. With relation to Seagate for example, it is clear that solid-state drives have been encroaching on projects where hard disk drives have been traditionally used.Seagate has been trying to pivot to protect its market share by improving its cost basis and by also entering the solid state drive arena. Nobody can predict the future as to how exactly the data storage sector will look in a decade for example. What investors can do however is to see how Seagate's financials have been trending. If there are any adverse trends in the key financials, the dividend may come under pressure in the future.The cyclical nature of this industry really shows up in the financials. Revenue for Seagate in its latest fiscal year came in at $11.18 billion. That is an increase of almost $1.3 billion since 2009. Gross margins have increased from 14 to 30% and operating margins are operating at their highest at 15+% over the past decade. Debt though has increased when compared to the company's book value. A decade ago, Seagate's debt to equity ratio was 1.28 but in its latest quarter, this key metric came in at 2.59. Remember this metric is usually calculated off interest-bearing debt.We have already seen though that the company's book multiple is well over 6. Therefore, if we take the company's total liabilities of $7.74 billion, the real liabilities to equity ratio comes in at 4.65. In potential value paying dividend stocks, we always want to be buying as much assets as possible in order to minimize risk in-case trading conditions change. Although Seagate looks attractive from a sales standpoint, its book multiple and debt to equity has been rising over time which brings risk to the table.How does this affect the dividend though? It must be said that although net income numbers declined in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, Seagate has been well able to generate free cash flow. At present, the payout ratio calculated from free cash flow comes in at 42%, which is attractive. Growth though has been lacking in the dividend department especially over the past few years as revenue growth has come to a standstill. Analysts who follow this stock expect the company to eke out 2.3% sales growth this year but 2020 is again expected to be negative.Earnings though due to rising margins are expected to improve going forward. This company, by studying the numbers, has very similar trends to the likes of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) earlier in its cycle. Seagate was turning over almost $15 billion back in 2012 but sales dropped by more than $4 billion in the space of 5 years. Rising margins have since saved the day from an earnings standpoint. Seagate though still needs to convince the market that it grows the business meaningfully. Furthermore, it doesn't have the balance sheet strength as P&G has.Therefore, to conclude, many value investors may feel that Seagate presently lines up as an attractive income play but we would be looking for more on the balance sheet. Although the interest coverage ratio is around 7 at present, the book value per share is only $5.78 at present. The stock may look cheap from an earnings, cash and sales standpoint but leverage on the balance sheet brings risk to the table. We will remain on the sidelines."
4221313,22786,2018-11-12T11:38:14-05:00,Seagate management will steer the company out of the near-term demand and price weakness during the next six months.Valuations are compelling and are comparable to Western Digital and Micron Technology.Dividend yield plus modest capital appreciation would give investors a 10% return in a year.,"When Micron Technology (MU) first kicked off 2018 with strong NAND and memory sales, markets at first embraced the stock’s low valuation of 6 – 7 times earnings, and by June, bid the stock at above $65 a share. The opposite happened for Western Digital Corporation (WDC) after the company first warned of weak NAND demand which drove its solid state drive sales lower. Seagate Technology plc (STX) did not fare any better: Its shares bottomed earlier this month at $36.69, down from a yearly high of $62.70.Now that the U.S. – China trade spat is in full force and risks worsening, what's different this time for NAND suppliers? Relative valuations are the same: Micron trades at half the P/E multiple than HDD suppliers, at 3.4 times, compared to 6.4 and 7 times for STX and WDC, respectively. Companies now know the temporary demand weakness may last six months. They have no clarity on how sales will fare for storage but know that the trade war will slow sales. Chinese New Year follows after this quarter, adding to the seasonal weakness. That gives value investors a chance to time the investment in Seagate stock.In the first quarter, Seagate reported decent revenue growth of 14.1% Y/Y to $3 billion. EPS of $1.70 annualizes the stock’s P/E of 6.3 times. Whereas WDC has a lower debt/equity ratio of one times, compared to Seagate’s 2.6 times, Seagate offers a better dividend yield. Seagate’s 148% Y/Y growth in cash flow from operations suggests that the company is unlikely to lower the dividend payout anytime soon. Strong Exabyte shipments, thanks to global data growth in data centers and cloud services, drove Seagate’s strong revenue, net income, and cash flow.Dividend Yield Compared to a 30-Year Treasury: Even with the near-term slowdown ahead, Seagate is positioned for the sales rebound that will follow early next year. It launched 14-terabyte hard drives in September, a capacity that will suit the NAS, desktop, hyper scale data center, and surveillance market. Corporate customers that held off orders in the quarter also may have anticipated larger-sized drives coming to market. The impact of order delays hurting sales will reverse in future quarters as data center customers order these drives. They will figure out that the five-year ROI on updating storage with the latest drive will pay off in the long run.Seagate forecast weaker enterprise spending caution from the China market. Pricing headwinds, an over-supply, and caution ahead of the tariffs waged against China will hurt Seagate’s results next quarter. The outlook contrasts with the strong Q1/2019 report, where Seagate grew its revenue by 14% and shipped 45.5 exabytes, up an impressive 67% from last year. Though the anticipated weakness may hurt sales of 12 terabyte devices, customers may defer spending and buy the latest 14 terabyte drives in the future.Seagate ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents. It announced a $0.63 a share dividend, which it will pay on January 2, 2019. Debt totaled $4.8 billion. Though debt/equity levels are unfavorable compared to that of Western Digital or Micron Technology, its net debt/EBITDA is 1.1 times.Per simplywall.st, Seagate’s future cash flow value pegs the stock’s fair value at $37.14, below its $43.03 closing price on Nov. 9:Source: simplywall.stIts debt levels are rising while its net worth (equity) fell over the last six years:Source: simplywall.stThough the above chart shows debt/net worth increased from 76.2% to 261.2% today, debt is adequately covered by operating cash flow.Management is confident that the near-term headwinds from macro uncertainties are a temporary drag on its business. The board authorized a share buyback of up to $3 billion. This, along with the regular dividend, maximizes the returns to shareholders as the business slows.Seagate is run by good management. Most tellingly, management did not panic as the demand fallout happened very quickly. Just like other firms, Seagate will cut expenses as minimally as possible without harming its long-term growth. Profit margin is unlikely to fall below the forecast 29% - 33% range. If business worsens, it has the flexibility in cutting operating expenses, depending on the demand environment. This step should not hurt its product launch plans. And while demand weakens, Seagate will keep its factories running at a healthy capacity.Nineteen analysts who cover Seagate have a $48.81 price target, or 13.4% upside, on the stock. Most analysts covering STX stock have a rating of at least four stars:Source: TipranksThose who ranked the stock a ""hold"" in the last week still have a price target that's above Seagate’s stock price.Using a five-year DCF Growth Exit Model assume a discount rate of 11% - 12% to factor in near-term risks. Assume revenue growing in the range of 0% (in FY2019) and 1.7% by FY2023.Source: finbox.io (click on the link to change estimates)Based on these assumptions, Seagate has a fair value of $45.50, which is slightly below the consensus target price. And with the stock paying out a dividend yield of 5.86%, adding the 6% upside would give investors a return of over 10% in a year."
4179713,48311,2018-06-06T09:23:25-04:00,"Update on a position initiated early 2018.Seagate technologies is in a business in secular decline.However, management is focused on shareholder return.Dying businesses can deliver attractive economics due to absence of competition.","Seagate Technologies (STX) is a relatively recent investment spurred by the realization the company, in addition to being a value investment, held a small percentage stake in Ripple. I think XRP (XRP-USD) - the cryptocurrency connected to Ripple - is very interesting and owning this value stocks is a more or less ""free"" option to own it. Because it is a relatively recent investment the original write-up is still quite current you can find it here. The idea did quite well initially but languished after that:STX Total Return Price data by YChartsSurprising to me revenue estimates continue to be revised upwards and that's in line with the company's guidance on the earning call:STX Revenue Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead data by YChartsShare prices tend to follow EPS and those estimates were revised upwards as well:STX EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YChartsOn revenue I don't expect much from Seagate. My reasoning is that the HDD market is probably dying over time and sales should fall at some point as SDDs (a more expensive but superior memory technology) can be manufactured at lower prices. What keeps HDD's afloat is that these are much cheaper to install on servers. In consumer PC's and laptops SDD's are for the most part much superior. However, the move towards cloud based software is saving HDD's. On an Enterprise level it is much easier to manage which data is put on SDD's and which data is put on HDD's. HDD's can be perfect to store data that doesn't need to be constantly brought up. It can't be accessed as fast but the storage is cheaper. However SDD's are a superior experience and if the price gap gets close enough HDD's are losing out. That's why I expect HDD sales to fall over time. If it doesn't fall from here on out, that's great for the long case. Because this is a dissapearing market there's been a lot of consolidation from 10 players down to 3 with Seagate being the giant in HDD marketshare. Who knows, Seagate may even R&D themselves into a future (from the earnings call):Usually companies are astute not to compete on price too much in these situations where there are few players left. That may allow Seagate to squeeze a lot of value out of the dying market. The company is guiding towards margins expanding a bit near the end of the year and that seems reasonable to me provided we don't see a cyclical downturn. Cash flow generation is already pretty good and even after the run-up the company now trades at just a ~10 free cash flow multiple:If analysts are right about the revenue trend and you couple that with margin expansion things are looking really good. If you are a bit more pessimistic about the longer term revenue trends that takes away things from the case but the margin expansion still makes up for some of it. CEO Mosley took over as CEO from Luczo end of 2017. Mosley came up through the ranks at Seagate over 20-years. Before taking over as CEO he was in the COO position and has also held R&D positions at the firm. Executive compensation is tied to solid metrics like total shareholder returns, ROIC and EPS. Starboard Value - a low key but highly successful activist - is on the board. Perhaps coincidental management is dedicated to returning 70% of operating cash to shareholders through both a dividend and buybacks. Some final words on the Ripple stake. I view it as a very interesting option. Speculation about Seagate's stake in Ripple has ranged from 2% to 4% which would very roughly correspond to a valuation of $800 million to $1.6 billion at today's XRP prices. Because XRP went down a lot and Seagate ran-up that doesn't make as much of a dent on the $18 billion Enterprise Value as it did early 2018. However, there are few assets that can run up like promising altcoins on a good day. If you don't believe in the value story of a company squeezing out the value in an industry in secular decline while an activist shop of reputation keeps management in check there's no reason to own it. However, if you believe, as I, that's an intriguing proposition, the Ripple potentially is still pretty much thrown in for free."

The stock has rallied substantially since the early January call that Ripple provided a catalyst for the stock, so the key signal is the yields at these higher stock prices.As a refresher, the market identified a few weeks back that Seagate Technology had a large position in Ripple Labs that controls a majority of the XRP cryptocurrency. At the time, digital currencies were all the rage and the position was valued in the multi-billions.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini was cautious on the position, but the analyst still estimated a value of $2.5 billion to $5.0 billion. In the ensuing weeks, XRP is down over 50% to $1.18.Source: coinmarketcap.comThe Ripple position held by Seagate Technology is down more in the $1.0 billion to $2.5 billion range now. The company didn't provide a lot of details on the FQ2 earnings call other than to confirm the investment.A investor should probably take this as confirmation that management agrees with the valuations thrown around regarding the investment in Ripple Labs.With the backdrop of strong cash flows that included FQ2 operating cash flows of $850 million and free cash flow of $773 million, the company has a strong stream of cash flows. These cash flows along with the Ripple investment provides a catalyst for the stock, but chasing Seagate Technology up at $55 is a different story. The market cap is now up at $16 billion lessening the impact of Ripple.The best part of the net payout yield concept (dividend yield + net stock buyback yield) is that price moves have corresponding impacts on buyback decisions. Not only do parabolic moves like the recent rally in Seagate Technology from nearly $30 to $55 push the yield down, but investors get to see how management handles the move with the ability to adjust the capital utilized.Prior to factoring in FQ2 buybacks, Seagate Tech saw the net payout yield dip to 7.75%. The yield is near the lowest level of the last five years.STX data by YChartsThe tech company spent $195 million on buybacks during the quarter. The amount was generally inline with what Seagate Technology spends on a quarterly basis and nearly even with the $188 million spent last FQ2.Source: Seagate Tech FQ2'18 presentation The rise in XRP was so fast and the investment is illiquid that the company probably didn't have time to factor the gains into the capital return decision. For this reason, the FQ3 buybacks are crucial considering Seagate Technology didn't repurchase shares last year.The sharp rise in the stock and limited growth prospects for Seagate Technology reduce the attractiveness of the stock, but the Ripple investment greatly reduces the risk for a stock that is far from expensive at 12x EPS estimates. The market doesn't expect much growth in the near term and data storage is a highly competitive and cyclical market, but the Ripple Labs investment could pay off big time if the recent price drop turns out as the trough.The key investor takeaway is that the fundamental prospects of business aren't great, but the stock still remains reasonably priced. The Ripple investment isn't factored into the value providing all upside and an interesting way to invest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology without taking on a lot of risk."
4218423,103480,2018-11-05T18:20:17-05:00,"Seagate shares rose minimally after reporting Q1 results, which is a surprise after Western Digital cratered more than 20% after reporting its quarter.Seagate is now the only memory stock to be in positive territory for 2018.This can be explained by the fact that Seagate has barely any presence in NAND flash, where prices are dropping fastest.However, Seagate's large premium to its memory peers makes it incredibly unattractive.Seagate also isn't immune to a memory downturn: The company's CEO also warned of slowing demand in China.","Despite the volatility that has trashed gains in the semiconductor space, especially for memory stocks, hard drive maker Seagate Technology (STX) has largely managed to hold on to its gains. After reporting Q1 results, Seagate further extended its gains, rising ~3% despite widespread pessimism in the memory space. The company reported growing year-over-year shipments, with rising trends in both enterprise and consumer products. With the widespread assumption that NAND flash prices are about to crumble, Seagate's reputation for being an HDD-only player have allowed it to keep its stock price afloat.Despite the fact that Seagate seems shielded from the flash-centric memory downturn, the difference in performance between Seagate and its memory peers grows still wider. Year-to-date, Seagate is still up 6% - beating even the S&P 500, while fellow memory maker Western Digital (WDC) (which has a foothold in both HDD and flash memory) is down by a stunning -40%:There's no doubt that Western Digital is more at risk of a downturn than Seagate. Having recently invested in enlarged flash capacity in response to seemingly strong demand, Western Digital shares tanked more than -20% last week when the company announced it would be reducing its flash output by 15%. Not exactly the best execution to invest in increased capacity, then slash it immediately. So it's not surprising that investors punished Western Digital for its faults, but the spread in valuation between Seagate and Western Digital, and to some extent Micron (MU) as well, is too large of a gap.Every memory stock is cheap at the moment. Though Seagate pays a larger dividend (a yield of just under 6%, at current levels), Western Digital and Micron are funneling a $5 billion and $10 billion share buyback, respectively. Capital returns at these memory manufacturers are incredibly high, reflecting less of a need to invest in capex during a commodity price crunch. I don't think Seagate's perceived safety (due to its HDD concentration), however, merits its premium relative to peers. On every metric - revenues, EPS and EBITDA - Seagate trades significantly above Western Digital and Micron: The argument against Seagate is not tethered to Seagate's business itself. It's impressive that Seagate has managed to drive mid-teens revenue growth amid flat shipments and an overall cautious environment in memory. Rather, the case against Seagate rests on the fact that we can pick up shares of its rivals at much cheaper prices. While Micron and Western Digital are far more cyclical stocks thanks to their flash dependency, it's far better to buy weakened stocks in the midst of a down cycle than buy Seagate when it's trading at a premium.Seagate, too, isn't immune to commoditized pricing for memory components. While HDD pricing has held steady so far, Seagate also can be susceptible to a fall if hard drive prices weaken. In my view, investors should be more cautious on Seagate and give more preference to its cheaper, beaten-down rivals. The argument against Seagate has less to do with its fundamentals than its relative valuation against peers: Its first quarter performance was actually a strong surprise, in light of much weaker performance from memory peers (though I don't believe the performance upside to be worth the valuation premium). Here's a look at the company's Q1 results below:Figure 1. Seagate 1Q19 resultsSource: Seagate investor relationsSeagate grew revenues by 14% y/y to $3 billion, surprising analysts who had a consensus estimate of $2.96 billion (+12% y/y) by a two-point beat margin. We already knew that HDD pricing trends were holding up much better than flash, but still, Seagate's results are a relief when comparing to Western Digital's -3% revenue decline.The revenue upside was supported by strong shipments in the quarter. A detailed breakout of the hard drive business' key metrics are below:Figure 2. Seagate HDD statisticsSource: Seagate investor relationsOverall unit shipments in the quarter tallied up to 98.8 million exabytes, up 40% y/y on an exabyte basis. Note also that within the enterprise segment (which have made up an increasing mix of Seagate's total revenues over the past several quarters), average TB capacity per drive is up sharply.CEO William Mosley also made some useful qualitative commentary on Seagate's assessment of the memory market on the Q1 earnings call:Essentially, both the Q1 results and Mosley's commentary validates the thesis that corporate needs for cheap, mass data storage is keeping the hard drive business afloat, even when competing against superior and faster flash.This trend has a huge risk, however. Hard drives and flash are, in most cases, substitutes - if the price gap between the two forms of memory widens enough, Seagate's hard drive customers may eventually opt for higher-performance flash instead. Hard drives are an old technology for whom the principal benefit is price. In this regard, Seagate isn't completely immune to a drop in NAND flash prices. Mosley's comment on ""caution"" in China also is a red flag. The company has lowered its forecast in Q2 to account for weaker China demand in its ""adjusting our build plans accordingly,"" according to the CEO. For the moment, Seagate also has been able to drive strong gross margin trends, reflecting the company's ability to maintain its pricing.Figure 3. Seagate gross marginsSource: Seagate investor relationsSeagate managed to increase GAAP gross margins by 250bps on a y/y basis to 30.5%. On a pro forma basis, it improved margins by 200bps to 31.0%. On margins, however, Seagate falls in comparison to Western Digital, which despite a contraction in NAND pricing was still able to achieve gross margins in the low 40s.Overall, Seagate's strong shipments growth and continued cost discipline have allowed it to nearly double operating income to $503 million, or a GAAP operating margin of 16.9% - far higher than 9.7% in the year-ago quarter. Pro forma EPS of $1.70 also beat Wall Street's estimates of $1.55 with 10% upside. While every memory company has sounded off warnings on the state of memory pricing and demand trends this quarter, Seagate is the only company to do so from a position of strength, with its strong y/y shipments growth and consistent gross margin profile. While Seagate's HDD focus is likely to make its down cycle much less painful for Micron and Western Digital, the fact that it trades at anywhere from a 50%-100% premium on both a revenue and P/E basis makes it the worse investment. On the capital returns side, while Seagate's 6% yield is a bit more tangible to investors, Western Digital and Micron's huge buyback programs are equally (if not more) reassuring merits. While Seagate's steady Q1 results are comforting, I wouldn't be a buyer of Seagate at this juncture. Investing in the other, cheaper memory giants will generate much greater rebound potential."
4197740,104183,2018-08-10T15:48:50-04:00,"I've run a DCF on Seagate Technology, an HDD maker that trades at an optically attractive set of multiples.The DCF implies over 100% upside, which more than compliments the high current yield of 4.59%.The company operates in a neutral growth environment, but has a stable cash flow profile and covers its dividend multiple times over.","Seagate Technology (STX) is a hard drive disk manufacturer that is in a flat to minimal growth industry. Thus, it makes it an ideal candidate for constant valuation observations as the outlook is relatively predictable. The stock has been trading sideways for nearly six months now, which indicates to me that investors are having a difficult time deciding what the shares are worth in a fair value scenario or it means that it has fallen off of investor radars. After running a discounted cash flow model on the company's shares and comparing it to current trading multiples, I've concluded the stock has significant upside to fair value, in the region of at least 40%. The discounted cash flow model alone implies a near doubling of the shares until fair value and investors need to not only take note but to consider adding shares at the current level.Source: GlassdoorAfter I finished building out the DCF for Seagate, I had to do a double take because I was shocked at the implied upside for my base case valuation. In beginning to walk through my assumptions, I've broken down WACC to be 10.5%. Despite the stable nature of the industry, the implied cost of equity via Bloomberg is 12.5% while the implied cost of debt is quite low at 3.70%. The latter probably better reflects the stability of the company, even with a decent gearing at 27.4%, as that's only 76bps spread over the current 10-year treasury. The other assumptions I made are pretty standard, such as a 2.96% risk-free rate to reflect the current ten-year and a 2% perpetuity growth rate. I think this perpetuity growth rate is generous in light of the sporadic historical EBIT profile, but consensus expectations suggest otherwise. Additionally, the company's beta is 1.36, which reflects significantly higher risk than most equities.Source: Author Derived From BloombergBefore delving into the model, it's worth noting that the company operates on a different fiscal year than most, as they've already completed FY2018. In the terminal year, Seagate ends up generating nearly $2 billion EBIT and $1.76 billion in NOPAT. In terms of depreciation, the profile has actually been very stable historically speaking, so there's ample rationale for me to project it based upon a trailing five-year average at around 6.4% of sales. I would've done this as a percentage of assets, but there are two inherent problems with that method. First, seeing as how stable the D&A profile is as a percentage of sales makes it a relatively trustworthy method to rely on and, second, it's more difficult to project total assets as a capex ramp in any given year could completely skew asset value.EBIT growth has been all over the board and it wasn't straightforward enough to take a historical five- or three-year average because of the large drop-off in EBIT from 2015 to 2016, as well as two years of double-digit negative growth followed by a more than doubling of EBIT in 2017. Thus, I'm looking to market consensus estimates for EBIT growth, which are in the ballpark of 1%. I've projected 1% EBIT growth through FY2021E, then 2% thereafter, assuming the company can see some sort of modest acceleration in profitability, but not to an outlandish degree. Taking a trailing four-year average for the tax rate, I arrive at 10.75%, which then impacts the NOPAT line. What investors should see is that there's a relatively consistent flow of NOPAT, which will end up supporting the thesis that the company's dividend can be classified as ""sleep well at night.""Source: Author Derived From BloombergSales growth is one of the headwinds for this company. I think there's significant upside for the stock if the company can start to generate real top-line growth because there's only been attrition or flat growth since 2014. Moving forward, the capex profile is relatively stable, in line with the stability of D&A, at around 4.3% of sales on a trailing five-year average. Changes in working capital have actually been quite volatile and have been almost equivocal to capex in certain years, but I've taken the average over the past five years and projected it to be constant over the long term. The company can also proactively adjust its capex profile with its working capital profile in order to keep spend under control. Considering capex levels have been a relatively stable percentage of sales, I'm confident in management's ability to execute on this.That brings us to the actual value of the company. The value of Y1-Y8 cash flows on the projection timeline is $9.9 billion and the terminal value is $24.2 billion. That puts the DCF-derived enterprise value at a whopping $34.1 billion. Adjusting for net debt of $2.46 billion, we arrive at upside of 101%. This is the point in the valuation where I had to do a second-take at my screen and comb through my assumptions as this is my base case valuation with relatively minimal growth implied. The WACC is also not exceptionally low (it's above 10%, after all, which may be considered high by many), so the terminal value isn't improperly skewed higher. The value of this company comes from a well-managed capital structure and the consistency of cash flow. Additionally, with a 4.59% current yield, the implied upside to fair value is 105.9% - quite staggering in my opinion.Source: Author Derived From BloombergI run a fair amount of dividend screens and am constantly looking for the combination of low historical relative valuation and a well-covered yield; however, there are so few stocks at this point in the cycle that fit the bill. I believe Seagate is one of the few exceptions. While I'm not too crazy about the industry it operates in, going forward there looks to be minimal delta in both sales and EBIT, which creates a solid current income play. Seagate's dividend is rather interesting. It's remained flat since Q4 2015 at a $0.63 quarterly payout, implying no short-term dividend growth. However, the five-year dividend growth of 11.5% is by no means bad and has provided a nice uplift to shareholders. I assume that dividend growth will return as soon as sales and EBIT growth does, that way management keeps its incentives aligned with shareholders, but this is still a quality yield in current standing at 4.59%. This is all the more true considering dividend coverage is 2.39x.Examining the company's current trading multiples tell a similar story to what the DCF model implies. The stock is trading at 8.8x forward earnings, a significant discount to its historical average of 10.5x and an even larger discount to its peer group at 11.3x. On an EV/EBITDA basis, the gap is a bit more narrowed, down just 5% relative to both its peers and historical average. The stock trades at 7.5x EV/EBITDA. Furthermore, even if I were to make a rough ""football field"" and take the average valuation from the DCF model and current trading multiples, the stock has a ballpark 40-60% upside depending on how you sensitize the assumptions to reflect various growth scenarios. The shares, this year, too, have cheapened considerably despite the stock staying relatively flat the last six months. P/E has declined from above 12x forward earnings to just 8.8x forward earnings after two quality earnings reports and increased analyst projections for forward earnings.Investors should have a relatively high level of conviction adding Seagate to their portfolio. After seeing such a significant margin of safety and high current yield relative to both the tech sector and broader market average, I can confidently say this is a great buy. The only push back is lack of industry growth, especially considering we're quite late into the business cycle. After considerably beat YE2018 earnings, I see no reason why the shares can't re-rate ahead of FY Q1 2019 results as investors uncover the value in both a stable cash flow profile and a high dividend."
4157114,102762,2018-03-16T12:42:11-04:00,"Seagate reported Q2 results, beating on EPS and on revenue. However, the organic growth is not so impressive.The company's financial performance raises some questions regarding the viability of the results.The amount of debt versus generated cash is not encouraging in light of generous dividend policy.The corporation's spend on R&D is decreasing, despite the need to introduce new technologies.","On January 21, Seagate (STX) reported the results for its Q2 FY 2018 ended December 2018. The results look good on paper: adjusted EPS increased 7% year-over-year, while the revenue returned to growth, even though 0.7% is a modest change.The growth in revenue was driven by strong HDD sales across client computing and enterprise segments. The corporation shipped 87.5 exabytes of capacity during the quarter, which is the highest quarterly level for Seagate. Importantly, 43% of this amount is attributable to the enterprise HDD market, which led to a higher average selling price - enterprise-grade storage tends to cost up to three times as high as the price of a consumer model with the same capacity.The nearline storage segment demonstrated the highest growth, with 35.1 exabytes shipped during the quarter, which is ""up 31% over last year's strong demand and up 75% from the December quarter two years ago."" Nearline drives are usually used as a bulk, cold storage for data that is not accessed frequently but still needed to be stored, and while digital data is replacing the paper archives, it seems that the demand for such solutions will grow in the near future. This makes the nearline market attractive for Seagate and will likely drive the performance of the company.Overall, HDD revenue was up 2% year-over-year in the December quarter.As regards non-HDD segment, the situation is not so confident, as cloud systems and silicon group revenue decreased 12% year-over-year. However, the company remains positive about its opportunities to leverage the long-term supply of NAND products from Toshiba Memory for ""significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions"" of the silicon product portfolio of SAS, SSD, and consumer and gaming markets. To remind, Seagate signed a commitment letter to invest up to $1.25 billion with the Bain-led consortium acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation.The increase in EPS of 7% year-on-year looks solid at first sight - not many storage companies have been able to achieve such results in recent years. However, the organic growth is not so impressive in light of decreasing amount of shares outstanding - the number has dropped by almost 3% since the end of 2016. As a result, the organic increase in adjusted EPS amounted to just about 4%. For instance, the main competitor of Seagate, Western Digital (WDC), managed to show the growth in adjusted EPS of about 70% during the same period, even though GAAP numbers suffered from the Tax Cuts and Jobs act significantly.STX Shares Outstanding data by YChartsAnother major point is the financial health of the corporation in terms of the relationship between debt, generated cash, and dividends. In general, it seems that Seagate's generous dividend policy could potentially hurt the company's ability to evolve in the tech space and put some pressure on the company in light of high debt.The situation requires a closer look at the details. Firstly, the company's efficiency regarding generating cash seems to decline. Seagate's revenue grew in the quarter, EPS went up by 7%, but cash from operating activities decreased by 13% year-on-year on a six-month basis. The number also includes the provision for income taxes (which should be paid at some point) of $204 million, and without this adjustment, the state of things is even worse. The significant difference also makes the divergence between the change in accounts receivable and accounts payable, as the former goes up while the latter goes down - in short, this indicates the company is likely not to manage its growth effectively.Although the issue with cash is not critical by itself, the general state of things is still alarming at the moment, in light of the company's dividend and buyback policies. Thus, Seagate spent $366 million on dividends and $361 million on share repurchases during the first two quarters of its FY 2018, an increase of 95% and 46% over the same period a year ago. If we include the repurchase of debt, the total number is $879 million, while the operating cash amounted to $1,087 million, which means the corporation spent 81% of its cash from operations on repurchases of shares and debt and dividends to shareholders. For a tech corporation from the fast-moving industry, such a level of capital return looks at least strange, especially taking into account the decrease in investments of 10%. To compare, Western Digital paid 12.7% of its operating cash as dividends, and also increased the level of investments by more than 200%.(Source of data: Seagate 10-Q)Then goes the debt itself. The total debt was $4.9 billion, the debt-to-cash ratio was around 1.9, which, again, looks good by itself. However, the company needs to pay off the principal of $560 million in November 2018 (Seagate's FY 2019), and in light of generating only $150 million in cash after investments, dividends, and buybacks, the repayment can cause troubles to Seagate. Moreover, Seagate needs to pay, on average, 4.65% of annual interest, which totals to hefty $228 million a year.The notes and bonds are also issued not by Seagate itself but by its subsidiary Seagate HDD Cayman. Notably, Moody's has assigned a Baa3 rating with a negative outlook to all the latest issuances - the lowest investment-grade rating, just above the speculative zone. Here is the agency's opinion on the matter:The rating agency is also concerned about the ability of Seagate to maintain the reasonable level of investments and reduce operating costs in order to support its obligation.When it comes to technology corporations, the spend on research and development is especially important, as it drives the innovation and therefore, the business itself. Notably, Seagate expenditures on R&D have decreased over years, raising the question over the company's ability to launch new successful products and compete in the storage industry.I already mentioned the concerns of Moody's over Seagate's future in the HDD market and its ability to roll out new products. The opinion is again reinforced by the fact that Seagate spends on R&D much less than its competitors, like Western Digital or Micron (MU). The companies are clearly not identical (especially Micron, which primarily focuses on memory chips), but the raw numbers and growth indexes indicate Seagate may not remain competitive if the trend continues.(Source of data: 10-Qs and Morningstar)Overall, it is seen that while Seagate's business has grown over the last two quarters, the financial performance is not so impressive. The corporation spends a huge amount of cash on dividends and buybacks, which increases the level of risk in light of declining cash from operations. The capital return program may be the main reason why the stock has climbed 26% over the last year, which makes the increase ""artificial.""STX data by YChartsMoreover, the company needs to repay $560 million in debt by November 2018 and spend more than $200 million on annual interest. This leads to reductions in capital spendings and R&D, making it unclear whether the product line-up would remain successful in the future.The main takeaway for investors is to stay cautious and watch closely the company's financial performance in the coming quarters, especially the statements of cash flows and R&D. The business looks strong at the moment and there is no need for panic. However, there is a chance Seagate may face financial troubles which will inevitably affect the stock price, since the possible options for the management would be to raise additional debt, further cut capital expenditures, or reduce its capital return program.My detailed analyses of Micron and other tech companies can be found on my profile page.

However, the company still faces long-term headwind as SSDs gradually replace HDDs even in the high-end enterprise market. Although Seagate’s current valuation is above its historical average, given the favorable outlook in the near term, its shares may continue to trend higher in the next few quarters.STX data by YChartsStrong Storage Demand Lifted Seagate’s Revenue And MarginSeagate posted a surprise quarterly earnings report thanks to strong demand and capacity growth in its HDD business. This is evident in its total HDD capacity shipped. As the chart below shows, its total HDD capacity shipment reached 87.5 exabytes (“EB”). This was a growth of 17.2 EB quarter over quarter and 19.3 EB year over year (or 28% year-over-year growth). Its average capacity per drive increased to 2.2 terabytes (“TB”), or a growth of 29% year over year. I am quite surprised to see these decent numbers especially that demand in the previous several quarters has been pretty flat (see chart below).Source: Q2 2018 Investor PresentationNot only did Seagate increase its demand, Seagate’s average selling price (“ASP”) per unit went up by 3% year over year to $68 per unit. This ASP growth rate showed that Seagate’s effort to pivot towards the enterprise market while reducing its exposure in low capacity drives has so far been working. As a result, its Q2 revenue increased to $2.9 billion, or an increase of 10.7% quarter over quarter.Source: Created by author; Company ReportsAs can be seen from the chart below, Seagate’s improvement in average selling price has positively impacted its gross margin.

This was due to its strong operating cash flow generation. Its operating cash flow in Q2 2018 was $850 million. This was the best in more than 10 quarters. Its capital expenditure in Q2 was $77 million, a slight decrease of $18 million from a year ago.

Its dividend yield at the current share price is about 5.2%.Source: Created by author; Company ReportsSignificant Opportunity In Cloud-Based Enterprise MarketIn the past quarter, Seagate’s enterprise HDD market increased dramatically. For the quarter, the company shipped a record capacity of 37.4 EB with an average capacity of 4.3 terabytes per drive. Similarly, its Nearline market also grew rapidly. In the past quarter, the company shipped 35.1 EB of capacity to its Nearline customers.It also grew its Nearline average capacity per drive to 5.9 terabytes or by 31% year over year. Looking forward, I believe Seagate will continue to have good opportunity in cloud-based storage. The strong demand from the cloud-based enterprise market should act as its best growth engine in the next few quarters. Seagate's management also expressed this optimism during its latest conference call:Ripple Is A nice AdditionIn Seagate’s conference call, the company also announced a company called Ripple that they had invested several years ago. Ripple is a company that drives technology innovation for distributed ledger and block chain use cases. Although lately, the attention for the company has been on its XRP crypto assets, Ripple’s real valuation lies on its block chain technology platform, which can be used in various applications such as in the financial industry. It is good to know that Seagate holds some valuable asset that I was not aware of until recently.Seagate may have had a good Q2 Fiscal 2018. However, investors need to keep in mind that a large part of its success was due to the imbalance in supply and demand of NAND (click here). This imbalance has resulted in elevated NAND pricing, which further impacts SSD’s adoption rate. The price increase has caused an implementation deceleration from HDDs towards SSDs. Together with a robust demand for storage capacity, this further benefits Seagate’s business as about 90% of its revenue comes from its HDD segment.Although Seagate is likely to benefit from the elevated NAND pricing, this tailwind may soon come to an end. As NAND suppliers continue to transition from 2D-NAND to 3D-NAND manufacturing technology, the NAND market is expected to regain supply and demand balance in 2018 (click here). If supply outpaces demand, it is possible that there will be a decline in NAND prices. This will result in unfavorable situations for Seagate as the difference in price between SSD and HDD will be further narrowed.While Seagate may have acquired the much-needed NAND supply in a recent agreement with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF), in an excessive supply environment, both its HDD and SSD margins will also decline. While the enterprise market continues to favor HDDs over SSDs due to higher capacity demand, the adoption rate of SSDs will increase if the NAND price continues to decline. In addition, Toshiba’s NAND supply also faces strong competition (both performance and price) from Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Intel (INTC).Despite the recent stock market selloff, shares of Seagate have appreciated 48.5% in the past 6 months. It is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 23.53x. This ratio is significantly higher than its 5-year P/E ratio of 15.20x. Its forward P/E ratio based on consensus EPS estimates is about 10.72x. This is still slightly above its 5-year average of 10.02x. Its current price to cash flow ratio of 8.70x is significantly higher than its 5-year average of 6.37x.Seagate had an excellent Q2 fiscal 2018 due to strong demand for more storage capacity. This demand is expected to carry over to the next few quarters. However, the company’s long-term headwind remains as SSDs gradually replace HDDs even in the high-end enterprise market. Although Seagate’s current valuation is above its historical average, given the strong demand in the near term, its shares may continue to trend higher in the next few quarters. However, investors need to be careful and should continue to monitor the demand and supply trend of NANDs.Note: This is not financial advice and that all financial investments carry risks.

4141132,103480,2018-01-30T04:54:47-05:00,"Seagate posted a terrific Q2 earnings release, beating analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines.To some extent, these results were expected, as the company had ""pre-released"" soft results a few weeks prior.Enterprise HDD shipments drove the bulk of strength in Q2.Still, however, Seagate's valuation has raced ahead in recent months, particularly beyond its nearest comp Western Digital.","Once a stock has momentum, it tends to be sustained. One such stock is Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX), the maker of hard disks and hard drives that has come roaring back in the past few months after the majority of the market had left it for dead. It turns out that the HDD business isn't dying after all (well - it is slowly declining in favor of higher performance flash memory products, but there's still a huge market for the cheaper HDD alternatives - particularly in the enterprise), and Seagate also had an additional trick up its sleeve: a purported ownership stake in Ripple, news of which first broke on Seeking Alpha.(A quick update on Ripple before we turn to fundamental topics - while the company did allude to its investment in Ripple during its earnings call, it didn't disclose its exact stake. Recent Wall Street research suggests the stake might not be that large.)Here's what Dave Morton, Seagate's CFO, had to say about Ripple on the earnings call:Ripple news as well as a resurgence of HDD fundamentals have kicked Seagate's stock into high gear in the past three months, with the stock returning nearly 50% during that time with few pullbacks.Now - right after an earnings release and a huge deluge of news - is the time to assess whether Seagate is still worth holding. The memory industry, after all, is extremely fickle - stocks like Seagate and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) are up and down like the weather - and any scent of declining ASPs or demand slowdown will cause a sharp pullback in a stock with few fundamental drivers in the near term.In particular, while I like the results of Seagate's quarter (though we've basically known that the company would beat earnings for a few weeks now, thanks to its preliminary January 8 announcement), I still don't think Seagate is worth the premium to Western Digital. Over the past year, I've been an investor in both stocks, and now I've switched to holding Western Digital purely on a valuation basis. While I truly like both companies (which have nearly identical businesses), I believe Western Digital's fairer valuation will make it a more defensive play in the case of a memory downturn.Here's a look at Seagate's valuation (orange line) relative to Western Digital across the three most prominent valuation metrics: revenue multiple, EBITDA multiple, and P/E, all forward-looking:It must be noted that Western Digital also posted an equally strong quarter last week, buoyed by the same HDD fundamentals that helped Seagate along. Looking at both companies' relatively cheap P/Es (though we are using earnings figures from a peak cycle), I like them both, but as I wrote in a prior article, I'm partial to Western Digital, especially with its lower valuation and clear-up of the Toshiba mess giving it a strong position in flash.Perhaps not exactly a surprise as the core outline of the results were broadcast two weeks ago, but still a pleasure for long investors to see. Seagate reported revenues of $2.914 billion (right in line with its soft release), essentially flat on a y/y basis but beating analyst expectations for $2.86 billion.Here's a look at the company's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings summary:Figure 1. Seagate Q2 resultsSource: Seagate investor relationsThe primary source of strength in the quarter, as the company highlights, was HDD, particularly to enterprise customers. The company shipped 87.5 million exabytes in the quarter, up 28% y/y, with the average capacity per drive shipped ticking upward to 2.2 terabytes/drive (up from 1.7 TB/drive in the prior year's Q2), accounting for the majority of the growth.Enterprise clientele represented a larger portion (40%) of this quarter's revenue mix than at any point during the last year - it was 36% in Q1 and 37% in last year's Q2. This underscores the thesis that enterprises aren't always after the best-performing memory solutions - they need cost-effective products (aka, HDD) to service their lower-tier workloads as well.Total HDD revenues in the quarter grew 2% y/y in the quarter, after declining in each of the past two quarters. Driven by robust results in this core business, Seagate reported extremely strong profit measures as well.Pro forma net income, as shown in the tables above, grew 5% y/y to $431 million. Five percent doesn't seem like a huge number - but for a business that was only a few months ago treated as stale as a retail stock, any amount of growth is desirable. This net income translates to pro forma EPS of $1.48 (+7% y/y), a substantial beat to analyst consensus of $1.35.EBITDA in the quarter also grew 6% y/y to $583 million, up from $550 million in the prior year's Q2.Cash flow was another big standout in the quarter. Operating cash flow grew 30% y/y to $850 million and free cash flow grew 38% y/y to $773 million.What the market gives, it can also take back. Such is unfortunately the nature with volatile memory stocks. And while Gartner did issue a recent report that the favorable memory industry trends are expected to hold strong at least through the end of 2018, Seagate's fortunes can reverse on a whim.There's a lot to like about Seagate's earnings. It broke two sequential quarters of revenue declines in the core HDD business, which is no easy feat. It increased its percentage of enterprise revenues as a total of its revenue base, which will have a stabilizing force on its results - as enterprise buying demands tend to be much less erratic than consumer products. And best of all, cash flow made a huge resurgence.But as the highest-valued companies in a sector tend to compress the most in a downturn, investors will have trouble playing on the defensive with Seagate as memory industry jitters return (Micron (NASDAQ:MU), the company probably most tethered to the raw memory industry, has seesawed up and down in the past few weeks with giant price swings). There's better value to be had in Seagate's closest rival, Western Digital."
4136472,48311,2018-01-10T04:34:25-05:00,"ValueStreet research published a superb article highlighting Seagate's 4% stake in Ripple.
        The market responded by trading the stock up as much as 7%.
        This is a closer look at the value of Seagate and whether there is still an investment opportunity here.","Yesterday ValueStreet Research published a highly interesting article on Seeking Alpha indicating Seagate Technology (STX) could own as much as 4.3% of the private company Ripple. Ripple being a company that operates the Ripple protocol and owns a large quantity of XRP. We have a position in XRP in The Black Swan Portfolio, initiated around the $0.248 level.Because of the earlier research it is clear how important the information ValueStreet brought to the forefront actually is. With this article we are initiating an opportunistic trade, reflected in our portfolio, and putting ValueStreet’s discovery in context.Seagate Technology is one of two remaining larger players in the HDD market. HDD is the legacy technology for hard drives with a spinning component. You can literally hear it spin sometimes. Nowadays you will often see SSD drives - which stands for solid state drives - in higher end machines or other situations where costs don’t matter. Alternatively you will see a combination of an SSD and a HDD drive in a machine. The SSD will contain the boot information that needs to be accessed quickly while the HDD drive is used for filing away stuff that doesn’t need to get accessed all the time.After major consolidation Seagate Technologies is dividing up most of the HDD market together with Western Digital. What’s holding up well are enterprise datacenter sales. It is unrealistic to expect anything other than falling sales over the coming years. Seagate is a dying business and the question is whether the cash flows it is throwing off and the off chance they come up with an interesting innovation, while shrinking compensate for the risk of its demise accelerating.Ripple is a software company that is marketing and building the Ripple protocol. This protocol allows for parties that join up to send money to each other in large quantities, within three seconds and at negligible costs.XRP is a digital currency that’s open source and can exist without Ripple the company. Ripple owns approximately 61% of XRP. 55 billion XRP are locked away through cryptographically secured contracts and released at a rate of one billion XRP per month. XRP is theoretically not necessary to transact on the Ripple protocol. However, it is the only currency that requires no trust between transacting parties.Graphically the relationships look something like this:To determine whether this is an actionable piece of information we need to look at market expectations for Seagate and whether the Ripple stake has been adjusted for.Most analysts have a hold rating on Seagate with mean earnings per share around $4. As a group they also project a slight revenue decrease and in my opinion projecting top line growth would be wildly optimistic.However, the slight revenue decline doesn’t exactly jive with the earnings estimates which look conservative to me. Not because the firm did so well lately but because of the shakeout that has occurred in the industry:Source: Shakeout with Mergers: Consolidation of the Hard Disk Drive IndustryWe’ve gone from massive competition to an industry with only two major players. That’s the second best thing to a monopolistic situation. The fact it’s a dying business is attractive in so far it will deter new entrants from coming in. Seagate and Western Digital have the option to really milk the state of their industry like there’s no tomorrow (which there literally isn’t).It’s true the average S&P 500 company has much better growth prospects but it also trades at 24x earnings.Seagate can be acquired for 9x EV/EBITDA or 12x free cash flow and 11.5x forward earnings. STX EV to EBITDA (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsEven if we look a the company in a vacuum it’s not unattractive. The market moved about 7% yesterday after ValueStreet Research pointed out the flaws in its valuation of Seagate.STX data by YChartsThat’s like saying oops we missed that $1.2 billion of value. If the market assumes the 4.2% stake in Ripple is correct it corresponds to something like a ~$30 billion net present value for Ripple. Ripple is more than just the number of XRP’s on its balance sheet. The company’s protocol can be used without XRP. As Ripple’s software is used an XRP position only captures part of the value that accrues to this currency trading platform. Ripple also makes money by licensing its software.The amount of its licensing fees aren’t public knowledge but IBM (IBM) did very well licensing software to big banks that Warren Buffett couldn’t resist making his first technology investment. These fees could be low but get raised aggressively as the platform captures a strong competitive position. If Ripple’s systems catch on you can expect XRP to appreciate. Even though it can theoretically function without XRP. It's functionality is much improved by the existence of XRP. It is also one of the few deflationary currencies. Every transaction a tiny amount of XRP is destroyed. This process shrinks the available amount of XRP over time. Whenever someone opens an account to trade through XRP it locks up 20 XRP. This is a measure to prevent network spam. It also has the added effect of taking a lot of XRP out of the market as global adoption ramps, limiting supply.One argument against the value of Ripple is that it will need to spend a large number of the XRP it holds to grow its platform.One cost I expect to be substantial is the incentivizing of market makers. Its platform is lightning fast and you can very easily trade between many different currencies at virtually no cost. The most important thing to a great trading platform is liquidity. Market makers provide liquidity but they operate with spreads. If markets are less liquid they will use larger spreads. In order to get the “liquidity begets liquidity” virtuous cycle going, Ripple is likely paying market makers a lot of money. In turn this allows them to take more risk on their positions and makes for a smoother market experience for users.Taking everything into account the value of Ripple likely surpasses that of the current value of its XRP holdings. At the time of writing the volume weighted average trading price for an XRP is $2.33 according to coinmarketcap.com after excluding Korean exchanges that generally offer substantial higher quotes and high volume. At 61 billion XRP that translates to $142 billion in value. Obviously the number should be discounted for the average lockup period of about 2 years but there is no sensible discount rate that gets you back to a $30 billion NPV. This means the market is greatly underestimating the value of Seagate's Ripple stake. We’ve seen the market is very interested in cryptocurrency stories and it gobbles up stock of companies that are very doubtful to ever reap any benefit from their blockchain or crypto involvement. We’ve also seen the effect on good companies with solid crypto investments where the share price appreciation has been explosive:OSTK data by YChartsFRMO data by YChartsAs an added bonus short interest in Seagate is very high. That’s actually not a good sign as far as the company its fundamentals go and it may indicate I’m overly optimistic on the company its prospects as far as revenue decline go. However, coupled with our experience in market reaction to crypto related investments there’s a decent probability a classic short squeeze ensues. Short squeeze potential adds to the expected IRR of a position.There seems to be limited risk in owning this company which fits a traditional value framework and where the option on Ripple’s success is embedded and underpriced. On a fundamental basis its a sound investment to begin with but we are also bullish on XRP its value. In addition we have recently experienced the market its enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies which together with the short interest makes for a potential explosive cocktail in stock price development. I’m adding a position to The Black Swan Portfolio equal in size to that in Altius Minerals. In theory it could be feasible to hedge out some of the risk by shorting competitor Western Digital (WD) for an equal amount."
4139489,103480,2018-01-23T14:51:48-05:00,"Since the beginning of 2018, Seagate's performance has outstripped Western Digital by nearly 20%.Seagate's pre-release of Q2 results, bolstered by strength in the HDD market, but this strength should carry over into Western Digital as well.Western Digital has a near-identical business mix to Seagate and is an even larger player in the HDD market than Seagate is.Seagate's rumored investment in the Ripple cryptocurrency only adds a couple points to its outperformance.Western Digital will report earnings on January 25; with HDD strong, an earnings beat is virtually guaranteed and the company will catch up to Seagate.","The market has two main players in the hard disk drive (HDD) arena: Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX). Despite these stocks historically moving rather close in tandem with each other - as they both occupy a near carbon-copy of each other's businesses - their performance has diverged rather noticeably in the first month of 2018.As seen in the chart below, Seagate is up 27% since the start of this year - making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 - while Western Digital, while still posting above-index returns, has lagged far behind its cousin. The central thesis of this article is that while there are some company-specific forces at play that are pushing Seagate up (specifically, its investment in Ripple), it's not enough to justify its outperformance relative to Western Digital. With Seagate hinting at strength in the HDD market that should also be a great tailwind to Western Digital, the latter will likely see a meaningful jump as it catches up to Seagate in the near term, creating a buying opportunity before Western Digital's January 25 earnings call.WDC data by YChartsInvestors have had a rocky relationship with the HDD space over the past several years - most argue that the technology is dying out in favor of NAND flash-based memory, which doesn't come with the magnetic spinners that make HDD memory so clunky and slow. Yet, HDD has seen a bit of a resurgence in 2017, as greater use cases for data-at-rest and the explosion of data volumes in general have made a compelling case for buying hard drives for non-critical workloads, instead of their much more expensive NAND counterparts.And it's not like the HDD players are oblivious to changes in market norms, either. Both Western Digital and Seagate have made inroads into NAND flash, with Western Digital just recently settling a long dispute with Toshiba over coveted NAND supply.With these two businesses so similar, there's no reason why Seagate should be racing so substantially ahead of Western Digital: most of the lift in the stock is due to industry-wide factors.Seagate is up for two main reasons since the start of the year, which is what we'll focus on in this article. The company has been a major news hub as it 1) announced preliminary results on January 8 that resoundingly beat analyst expectations, and 2) an earth-shaking Seeking Alpha article, posted on this very site, suggested that Seagate may own up to 4% of the crypto company Ripple, with a current valuation that makes it one of the largest private unicorns.The central focus of this article is simple: Seagate's crypto associations, if properly valued, only contribute to a few points of the stock's outperformance; second, extracting this crypto-related upside, its HDD-driven gains should translate into Western Digital as well. With Western Digital due to report earnings on January 25, it's virtually guaranteed to report numbers to the upside as few investors have baked in the HDD strength read-through from Seagate's preliminary report.First, let's put a rough target on the value of Seagate's Ripple investment. The Ripple cryptocurrency XRP, at the time of writing, is trading at $1.34, giving it a market cap of $52 billion. Ripple owns ~60% of XRP's market cap ($31.2 billion), and recent analyst notes claim Seagate's stake in Ripple to be between 2-3%, stemming from Seagate's participation in Ripple's $55 million Series B round in 2016. It wasn't the lead investor; a Japanese investment company called SBI Investment was.Assuming the midpoint of 2.5% of analyst assumptions, we can estimate Seagate's Ripple-related value at $780 million - we can be generous and round this up to an even $1 billion. With Seagate's current market cap at $15.2 billion, this implies that Ripple is responsible for, at the most, 6% of Seagate's rise.And note that assuming this $1 billion value-add for Ripple is already a contentious assumption, within the past year, Ripple's value has fluctuated from a low of <$0.01 to a high of >$3. Maybe investors are banking on Ripple's value soaring in Bitcoin-style fashion to account for more a jump in Seagate, but that's an extremely speculative call that few investors are likely to make.Seagate is beating Western Digital by ~19% since the start of this year; in theory, after netting out the Ripple value, this leaves ~13% in HDD-related gains that Western Digital should be sharing in.In its January 8 press release, Seagate reported that it expects $2.9 billion of revenue in Q2, representing 10% sequential growth over Q1 revenues of $2.632 billion.Note that we're focusing on sequential growth here (instead of y/y growth, which is roughly flat) because Seagate had originally guided to 3-5% in sequential growth (producing a negative y/y comp). This is a 5-point beat to the high end of Seagate's guidance - which, considering HDD is thought of as a ""dead"" space, is truly impressive.Seagate attributes its upside performance entirely to HDD:In theory, this should play well for Western Digital as well as Seagate. After all, Western Digital has a 5-point market share lead over Seagate in HDD. Though the only possible explanation for Western Digital's failure to catch up would be if it lost market share to Seagate, this isn't too likely of an outcome, as the two companies' market shares have held steady over a long period of time. More than likely, the growth in HDD was evenly distributed across the industry.Western Digital hasn't touched its guidance since December. The consensus analyst average revenue target for Western Digital is $5.3 billion, right in line with Western Digital's own guidance. If Seagate saw upside in HDD during the holiday season after Western Digital set its guidance (on December 12), it's likely to carry over into upside for Western Digital as well. Note that hard drives have a lot of consumer end-uses, such as in PCs and gaming, so a surprise holiday bump is very much within the realm of possibility.Of course, we shouldn't be looking at these two stocks' valuations in an aquarium: it could very well be that they are both expensive. Just because one is up more than the other, doesn't necessarily mean that either is good value.It turns out, however, that this is not the case. Both Western Digital and Seagate trade at forward P/E multiples that are substantially below market averages (partially due to investors' fear that the memory super-cycle is coming to an end). With the S&P 500 at ~18-19x forward P/E, either of these stocks is a superb value buy.And Western Digital, at just 6.4x forward P/E, is substantially cheaper than Seagate - trading at more than twice its valuation. If Seagate were below Western Digital's valuation and its recent rally was just a catch-up, then it wouldn't be a major buy signal for Western Digital. But as it turns out, not only was Western Digital always the undervalued play, but the spread has widened even further.WDC PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe key sound bite from this article: Western Digital has a lot of catching up to do. If investors like Seagate this much, they should be throwing at least a little bit more love onto Western Digital. Western Digital's earnings, coming up on January 25, are very likely to be an upside catalyst to support its catch-up rally."
4168468,103480,2018-05-02T10:01:58-04:00,"Seagate has been the best-performing stock in the memory segment of the semiconductor industry this year, but its results have been far from the best.Q3 results showed a slim beat to analysts' consensus. With Seagate so heavily focused on HDDs and having minimal presence in NAND flash, future growth opportunities are compressed.Ultra-high yield used to be one of the major reasons to invest in Seagate. Now, Seagate's stock rise has put the forward yield at 4.6%, lower than before.The valuation gap between Seagate and faster-growing memory stocks like Micron and Western Digital has widened.","Seagate Technologies (STX), one of the largest makers of hard drives and the undisputed leader in the enterprise hard drive segment, tanked after releasing Q3 results. At first glance, the company's headline metrics do beat Wall Street's consensus, albeit by a small margin. But this quarter, it seems investors are becoming increasingly picky about earnings amid a much more volatile macro backdrop. Investors are no longer content with companies simply beating the curve and scoring Bs on the earnings report card - for shares to see an earnings rally right now, a perfect A is necessary.This was simply not the case for Seagate, whose 5% revenue growth in the quarter hardly succeeded in inspiring bullish action from traders. It's also fairly evident that a growth gap exists between Seagate and its nearest comp, Western Digital (WDC), which grew 8% in its most recent quarter. The latter, a much larger and more diversified company, also has exposure to the stagnating hard drive sector, but Western Digital's recent spats with Toshiba have earned it a fast-growing joint venture in the NAND flash space. As NAND technology transitions toward 3D NAND (allowing chipmakers to stack memory chips on top of each other and preserve space, rather than laying them out in a flat plane), Western Digital is well-positioned to capture demand shifts in the memory sector. Seagate, with its stubborn exposure to just the hard disk side of the market, is largely unable to capture any industry-wide opportunity.As such, it's rather unsurprising that Seagate failed to rally on an earnings beat that, for the most part, was purely optical. Investors are finding few reasons to keep buying a stock that has already been one of the best performers in the S&P 500 this year with 28% YTD gains.STX data by YChartsMuch of these gains were accelerated in January, when reports circulated that Seagate's investment in Ripple Labs, the maker behind the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, could be worth billions. Since then, the Ripple-related frenzy has died down, leaving Seagate with little to show on the fundamental side.As reported by SA News, several Wall Street analysts have upgraded Seagate and raised their price targets. While I agree that Seagate is still a good company with a below-average valuation, it's far from the best semiconductor or memory buy right now. As seen in the charts below, while Seagate is still cheaper than the broader market, it is the most expensive of the large-cap memory stocks by a substantial amount, trading at valuations roughly twice that of Micron (MU) and Western Digital.STX PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsGiven this discrepancy, I'm keen to back away from Seagate shares.When I first wrote on Seagate last fall, Seagate was trading in the mid-$30s and sported a 7% yield. I chose to lock in my gains on my position - a bit too early, missing out on much of this year's rally, but my logical reasons for selling still hold. I'd much rather hold cheaper memory stocks than a premium-valued Seagate.Many other investors are probably thinking the same thing. With Seagate's shares up so strongly this year, the company's attractiveness on a yield basis - one of the biggest reasons for investing in the stock - has significantly diminished. My prior bullish thesis was centered on the fact that Seagate had a strong enterprise hard drive business that wasn't going to peter out anytime soon (usually, when a stock has a >7% yield, it's an indicator that the core business is about to expire - not the case with Seagate), and patient investors could reap huge, above-market yields while waiting.It turns out that investors who got in last year were treated to both yield and substantial appreciation, which was a welcome surprise for a seemingly stagnant stock. However, at the current juncture, Seagate's currently quarterly dividend of $0.63 - declared alongside earnings and no change to the previous dividend - represents a forward annualized payout of $2.52 and a yield of just 4.6% against today's stock price of $54.While this is still an above-market yield, it's no longer the big buy-inducer that it was in the past. Undoubtedly, demand from yield investors will wane as soft results diminish the possibility of appreciation, and bullish sentiment for Seagate may deteriorate.Seagate had a decent quarter in Q3, but nowhere near the amount of upside the company generated against Wall Street consensus in Q2. The company more or less continued the same trends seen last quarter, but with a much smaller upside to the Street's expectations this time around.Here's a look at the results:Figure 1. Seagate Q3 resultsSource: Seagate investor relationsAs previously mentioned, Seagate grew revenues by 5% y/y in the quarter to $2.80 billion, which was a very small beat over analyst consensus of $2.74 billion (+3% y/y).Like last quarter, this growth was a function of greater exabyte shipments, offset as usual by ever-declining ASPs (technology, especially old technology, only ever gets cheaper. The real question is when Seagate's growth in byte shipments will fail to catch up with the decline in ASPs). Seagate shipped an astounding 87.4 million exabytes in the quarter, up 33% y/y from 3Q17's exabyte shipments of 65.5 million (the bridge between 33% exabyte growth and 5% revenue growth is, roughly speaking, the compression in ASPs).Here's a look at exabyte trends over the past few quarters:Figure 2. Seagate key metricsSource: Seagate investor relationsLike last quarter, average capacity growth was the key driver of the shipments increase, with average capacity per drive now reaching 2.4 TB, up from 1.8TB in 3Q17. Note in particular the strength in enterprise demand, where average capacity per drive has reached 4.8 TB, up 50% y/y from 3.2TB in 3Q17.Files are getting larger and larger, and data itself is becoming more numerous. Enterprises need cost-effective solutions to store their precious masses of data, and low-cost HDD products like Seagate's are often the optimal solution for non-critical data that doesn't need frequent access or analytical speed, for which a flash storage method would be optimal. This is Seagate's core strength, and a major part of its bullish thesis that hasn't changed.Notice also that enterprise has hit a historic high mix of Seagate's total revenues, claiming 44% of the business in 3Q17 - up from just 36% in 3Q17. The more exposure Seagate has to the enterprise segment, the more stable its revenues will be, and less subject to the whims of, say, the PC refresh cycle.Despite a small dip in gross margins (30 bps, from 30.5% in 3Q17 to 30.2% this quarter), Seagate managed extremely well on its cost discipline, bringing down operating expenses to $406 million in the quarter, versus $550 million in the year-ago period. Year over year, Seagate shed about 1,000 employees in its total headcount. As seen in the financials above, this efficiency was captured across all components of Seagate's opex, but particularly product development, which fell on a dollar basis as well as a percentage of Seagate's revenues, from 12% in 3Q17 to 9% this quarter. While the cost savings is a huge plus for current quarter optics, the reduction in product development costs does reinforce the notion that Seagate is somewhat stagnating.All told, however, the small top-line growth combined with significant operating margin expansion allowed Seagate to boost net income to $381 million and EPS to $1.65, both leaping nearly 2x from last year. Pro forma EPS of 1.46 also bested Wall Street consensus of $1.32.Despite the fairly good results from Seagate this quarter, it's difficult to find reasons to continue buying the stock. Among the many reasons discussed in this article, Seagate's yield has significantly compressed due to its fantastic rise in the past few months. And while revenues are growing and profit expansion is magnificent, it's unclear if or when HDD demand slows down to the point where Seagate's declining ASPs begin to take hold and send the stock to negative y/y declines. It hasn't been that far off in the past - Seagate posted flat revenue growth in Q2, despite being over Wall Street's expectations.At this juncture, Western Digital looks much more attractive than Seagate in almost every way. Revenues at Western Digital grew 8%, at a company that has much more exposure to the high-growth flash memory sector. Western Digital, too, is driving strong (+52% y/y) pro forma EPS growth, and it's trading at a P/E of 5.5x - about half of Seagate's valuation. If you compare the growth rates and profit expansion of the two companies, there is nothing inherently stronger about Seagate's business that merits such a premium relative to Western Digital and, to a lesser extent, Micron (though Micron's business of manufacturing raw memory isn't an apples-to-apples comparison).The bottom line on Seagate: it's still a great company that has a stable enterprise HDD business, but it pales in attractiveness as a memory stock investment. Seagate's post-earnings slump, despite the modest beat to expectations, is a telling indication that many investors are feeling the same way."
4135878,72965,2018-01-08T08:29:48-05:00,"Seagate Technology invested in the Series A and B of Ripple, owner of 61% of XRP, a top-three cryptocurrency.Ripple holdings of XRP are currently worth over $180B on the market.If Seagate still has its Ripple investment, it could plausibly be worth $7.8B, two-thirds of its market cap.The street has given zero credit for its crypto-investing prowess.","Many words have been used to describe Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), a large manufacturer of hard disk drives: dated technology stock, stable dividend player, acquisition target.How about masterful cryptocurrency investor? It turns out that Seagate Technology invested in both the 2015 $28m Series A and 2016 $55m Series B rounds of Ripple, the company that owns 61% of XRP, a top-three cryptocurrency in the world.Source: Crunchbase.comAccording to CoinMarketCap, there are currently 100B total XRP in existence, of which Ripple (the company), owns 61B. At current prices (~$3/XRP), this is worth $183B on paper.Source: Coinmarketcap.comWe can hypothesize that Seagate has not cashed out its investments in Ripple, as it participated in both the Series A and Series B, and there hasn’t been a major liquidity event for the company. If you believe that it still maintains this investment, the question then becomes: What percentage of Ripple does it own and what is it worth relative to its $12.4b market cap?According to TechCrunch (Setting The Right Valuation For A Competitive Series A Round), “Generally, the valuation range results in the group of Series A investors taking 15-25 percent of the company.”Source: Techcrunch.comIn the Ripple Series A, there were 12 investors in the round, which was led by IDG Capital Partners. It’s hard to say what the breakdown of investment was within the round, but combining that fact with the 15-25% cut mentioned above, we can estimate that Seagate bought around 1% of Ripple at that time.According to LawTrades (What is the Usual Percentage of Shares that go to Seed, Series A, and Series B Rounds? - LawTrades), a company raising a Series B can expect to sell about 33% of its equity.In the Ripple Series B, there were 10 investors in the round, which was led by SBI Investments. Doing the same calculation as above, dividing the 33% expected equity sale to 10 investors, we can estimate that Seagate bought around 3.3% of Ripple at that point.Therefore, across the two rounds, a rough estimate is that Seagate bought and owns 4.3% of Ripple.Multiplying that figure by the $183B of XRP that Ripple currently owns, we can estimate that the current value of Seagate’s investment in Ripple is approximately $7.8B, or roughly two-thirds of the market capitalization of the company.It seems the market has accepted Seagate as a stodgy old-technology company and has overlooked the value of its investment in Ripple. Otherwise, if we assume that the market has fully priced in the value of the Ripple investment, the rest of the company is trading at less than 6x earnings.Furthermore, the price action in the last year doesn’t reflect the value that a 4% investment in Ripple would add to the company. Ripple increased by 30,000% in 2017, which should have added billions to the share price of STX, had it been priced in. Instead, STX was up 9.6% in 2017.Source: Google FinanceThe fundamental business of Seagate is the manufacture and distribution of hard disk drives. Although overall company revenue has declined the last couple years, the company still made a $786m profit in the TTM period. The company is trading for ~12x earnings and pays a dividend yield of almost 6%. An earnings multiple of low teens seems reasonable for such a business, not including the hidden asset of Ripple.If you factor the above Ripple valuation of $7.8b, the value of the underlying hard disk drive business is about 4.6B, or approximately 5.9x earnings. If there is indeed a hidden investment in Ripple, the stock is a screaming buy at this level.Overall, I think that a readjustment of value by the street could cause a massive upside price move in STX, and those who believe in the long-term viability of Ripple should relish the chance to own a part of the company."
4106796,103321,2017-09-13T20:32:27-04:00,Seagate saw its revenue decline 9% YoY in its Q4 fiscal 2017.SSDs are expected to continue to replace the use of HDDs as the cost difference between the two narrows.The company’s dividend is sustainable in the near term but may see a cut if its revenue continues to decline.,"Shares of Seagate (STX) have not done well in the past six months, and the company posted another disappointing quarterly report in late July. Its revenue continued to decline due to weak HDDs demands. However, the recent decline in Seagate shares has elevated its dividend yield to over 8%. We think the dividend is sustainable in the near term, based on our free cash flow analysis. However, as the revenue continues to decline, there is a possibility that we will see a cut. Along with the return we estimated based on the target price calculation, we do not think we should initiate a position at this price.Source: StockCharts.comLet us first take a closer look at why the stock price has been performing poorly. The reason of the poor performance in the past half year was due to the company's poor fundamentals. Its revenue has been declining for 3 straight years. Excluding the sight gain in 2015, the company's revenue has been on a decline since its fiscal 2012. The chart below shows Seagate’s quarterly revenue in the past 2 years, and we can see it continues to decline. Its Q4 fiscal 2017 revenue was $2.41 billion, down 9% YoY and 10% from its previous quarter.Source: Created by author, company reportsThe reason behind the revenue decline is that the company’s largest product segment, its HDD business, is declining due to weak HDD demand. Not only are PC sales growth stagnating, and in some quarters even modestly declining, but more and more PCs shift to use SSDs for their hard drive as the pricing different between SSDs and HDDs continues to narrow.Seagate’s EPS has not been doing too well in the past few years. The graph below shows its EPS in the past 10 years. As can be seen from the chart, after the company moved out of the recession in 2009, Seagate reached the peak in 2012, posting $6.49 per share EPS. However, with weak PC sales demand and the gradual substitution of SSDs for HDDs, its EPS declined and reached a near low of $0.82 in 2016. The improvement in EPS in 2017 was mainly due to Seagate’s restructuring effort, as its revenue continued to decline.Source: Created by author, company reportsThe chart below shows the company’s quarterly gross margin in the past 2 years. The restructuring effort in 2016 has resulted in an improving gross margin. The margin reached the peak near 31% in Q2 fiscal 2017. However, this margin declined by 280 basis points quarter over quarter. The decline in both revenue and gross margin quarter over quarter likely was the cause of the stock’s continued decline since Seagate posted its Q4 earnings.Source: Created by author, company reportsNow that we have looked at why the share price declined, we will look at the company's operating strategy to see if it can turn its business around.Seagate is placing more emphasis on selling HDDs for enterprise systems, as management believe strong data storage demand in the cloud will result in high demand for the company's high-capacity HDDs. We like the strategy of focusing on storage demand from enterprise systems. However, we have not seen much revenue growth in the company's enterprise systems segment. The chart below shows Seagate’s revenue by product segment, and as we can see, its enterprise revenue as a percentage of its total revenue has not changed much while its total revenue continues its decline.Source: Created by author, company reportsSeagate does sell SSDs through a supply agreement with Micron Technology (MU). However, the quantity is not huge. In addition, the supply is not as stable as having production capacity of its own. The good part is Seagate avoids the high capital expenditure of flash production.The company’s future still rests on its revenue from sales of HDDs for PCs and enterprise systems. According to Gartner, 83% of mobile PCs and 62% of desktop PCs will come with SSDs by 2020. This will further erode Seagate’s revenue - especially, overall PC sales are expected to decline slightly. On the enterprise side, SSDs are expected to grow rapidly, but HDD demand is going to remain strong. Demand for data storage space will continue to demand HDDs, as high-capacity HDDs still have better cost advantage over SSDs. However, as the cost difference between HDDs and SSDs continues to narrow, once a sweet spot is hit, Seagate’s revenue from enterprise systems may decline.In its operation, the company continues its effort to restructure. On top of Seagate’s announced 40% HDD production capacity reduction last year, it is also laying off 600 employees. This will result in $90 million savings per year.Now that we have discussed Seagate’s future prospects, we will check if its 8.2% dividend yield is sustainable or not. We will take a look at the free cash flow generated. This is an important metric to see if its dividend is sustainable or not based on past performance. The chart below shows the company’s dividends per share and its free cash flow per share on an annual basis. As the chart shows, Seagate has good dividend coverage going forward. Its dividend per share decline in 2017 was due to the adjustment to its dividend payment date. The company will continue to pay the same quarterly amount, as management iterated in the conference call.Source: Created by author, company reportsWe all know that past performance does not guarantee future results. If Seagate’s revenue continues to decline, the company may one day not generate enough free cash flow to cover its dividend payment amount. While this may not happen in the next few quarters, it is a risk investors should be aware of.Consensus among 28 analysts on the company’s fiscal 2018 EPS is $3.67 per share. Its 4-year average P/E ratio is 10.9x. Since revenue may be further eroded by SSD substitutions if the pace accelerates, and there is a possibility of dividend cut, we need to apply some margin of safety. Therefore, we will use a P/E ratio of 9.5x. With this, we calculated its target price to be $34.87 per share. This works out to about 6.2% at today’s closing price. We noted that a dividend cut will likely result in lower share prices as well.Although there is growth potential in Seagate’s HDD sales in enterprise systems, its HDDs for PCs are likely to continue to decline due to SSD replacement. This pace will only continue as the pricing gap between SSDs and HDDs narrows. With limited growth and a possibility of dividend cut lingering, the risk of buying the stock outweighs the possible return. Therefore, we do not recommend initiating a position in Seagate at the moment.Thank you for reading.

4127178,103321,2017-11-22T12:12:05-05:00,"Seagate posted better than expected Q1 fiscal 2018 earnings.However, its revenue and free cash flow continue to decline year over year.Seagate's outlook also depends NAND flash prices as pricing is the major factor for SSD adoption rate.","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) released better than expected first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings. The earnings suggest signs of stabilization for its HDD business. As a result, its shares climbed upward and reached its three-month high of $39.42 on November 17. Its 6.4% yield remains attractive. However, both of its revenue and free cash flow generated continued to decline year over year. In addition, Seagate's better than expected earnings may be due to elevated NAND flash prices that slow down the adoption rate for SSDs. If NAND flash supply and demand reverses, Seagate's core HDD business may be in danger of losing more revenue. Hence, I would be cautious investing in Seagate's shares.STX data by YChartsDespite better than expected earnings release, I am still concerned as Seagate's Q1 fiscal 2018 revenue continued to decline year over year. Even with more exabytes shipped than last quarter, it still cannot make up the loss of revenue due to rapid decline in storage pricing. As a result, its past quarterly revenue declined to about $2.6 billion, or a decline of 5.9% year over year. This would be two straight quarters of year over year decline. Seagate's revenue also continued to decline year over year. In Q1 fiscal 2018, its total HDD units were down 5%.Source: Created by author, Company ReportSeagate may have had better than expected Q1 fiscal 2018. However, one factor we must realize is the fact that NAND is currently under-supplied. The imbalance in supply and demand has resulted in elevated NAND pricing which further impacts SSD's adoption rate. The price increase has caused an implementation deceleration from HDDs towards SSDs. This benefits Seagate's business as about 90% of its revenue comes from its HDDs segment.Although Seagate is likely to benefit from the elevated NAND pricing, this tailwind may soon come to an end. As NAND suppliers continue to transition from 2D-NAND to 3D-NAND manufacturing technology, the NAND market is expected to regain supply and demand balance in 2018 and possibly a slight over-supply. This is because 3D-NAND manufacturing effectively increases the storage density. When supply outpaces demand, we will likely see a significant reduction in NAND prices. This will result in unfavorable situations for Seagate as the difference in price between SSD and HDD will be further narrowed. Since 90% of Seagate's revenue comes from HDD, even a modest 5% decline in HDD market share will be detrimental for the company. For investors of Seagate, it will be important to monitor the supply and demand of the NAND flash market.Seagate has been long criticized by analysts as having little presence in SSDs. Management has come to realize that themselves. In order to secure its own NAND supply, the firm announced in the past quarter that it would participate in Bain Capital's offer to buy Toshiba's (OTCPK:TOSBF) NAND fabs. I applaud for Seagate's decision as NAND is clearly the choice for customers demanding high performance storage. In the joint offer, Seagate has agreed to provide $1.25 billion in financing in exchange for a long-term agreement with Toshiba Memory to provide NANDs.This deal, if it goes through, will be highly favorable to Seagate as the firm will acquire the much-needed flash memory capacity and ensure long-term supply. The deal will also come at the expense of Western Digital (WDC) as Western Digital had been Toshiba's joint partner prior to the deal. At the moment, it appears that Western Digital is not prepared to let the Bain deal go through without a fight. The dispute will have to be decided in court. We will have to continue to monitor this news to see how the story plays out.Finally, as a dividend investor, it will be important to monitor its free cash flow. There is no point to invest in a company that does not have enough free cash flow to support its dividend payment. As the chart below shows, Seagate's free cash flow generation continues to be greater than its dividend payment. However, we can see a worrisome trend. The gap between the two is narrowing. Its dividend per share decline in fiscal 2017 is mainly due to its adjustment of dividend payment date which resulted in one less dividend payment. As management indicated, it expects to continue to pay its quarterly dividend forward. At the moment, it appears that Seagate's dividend is still safe, but I am concerned about its free cash flow generation trend. If this declining trend continues, the company will either have to cut its capital expenditure, or to cut its dividend. Cutting its capital expenditure will reduce Seagate's ability to compete with its competitors in the long term. On the other hand, cutting its dividend will have an immediate impact on its share prices but may be better for the company in the long term as it will need to reserve capital while transitioning its business.Source: Created by author, Company ReportIn conclusion, Seagate may have posted better than expected earnings. However, both its revenue and free cash flow generation continued to decline year over year. It appears to me that the improving business may be temporary as due to supply and demand issue of NAND flash. Its HDD business may continue to suffer decline if NAND flash prices decline. Although its free cash flow continues to surpass its dividend payment, the declining trend is worrisome. I would remain very cautious and not to invest in its shares at the moment.Note: This is not financial advice and that all financial investments carry risks.

4115660,103480,2017-10-24T04:38:34-04:00,"Seagate reported a massive Q1 (September) beat, with PF EPS of $0.96 beating consensus of $0.85. Revenue beat by $110 million as well.Despite a 6% y/y revenue decline and 3% y/y earnings decline, Seagate’s results showed a remarkable stabilization in its troubled, flagship HDD business, which is facing competition from modern SSDs.The surprise upside had Seagate’s stock trading up as much as 15% intraday, with other memory stocks like Western Digital also trading up in sympathy.With its fundamentals looking stable, Seagate’s dividend (currently $0.63 per quarter, or approx. 7% yield) looks safe. The company has paid a dividend since 2003.","Investors had feared the worst for Seagate (NASDAQ: STX) and the fate of its core business - selling hard drives and disk-based memory, primarily for enterprise servers. With the rise of solid-state drives (SSDs), which offer much faster performance, industry speculators had feared that the HDD market has been rendered obsolete. Such fears have driven down Seagate’s stock from the highs of nearly $50 this year and made its dividend yield extremely juicy (around 7% at the time of writing), and the stock hadn’t made a spectacular comeback until its Q1 print for the quarter ended September.As I covered in a previous article, Seagate's primary competition in SSD drives - built on extremely supply-constrained, expensive NAND flash technology - is often prohibitively expensive, and enterprises still have need for cheap storage solutions for their noncore data assets that don’t need speedy processing. Thematically this makes sense - these days, many companies consider data to be their most valuable asset, and they strive to collect as much of it as possible. Not all of this data is going to be used routinely in intensive applications 100% of the time, applications that require top-tier processing speed - most of this data is backup for niche analysis, scenarios that don’t require perfect uptime.With this quarter’s release, Seagate has proven to the market that while demand for HDDs is no longer in its heyday, it can still appropriately cover the non-premium segments of the storage market. HDD shipments rose 5% for Seagate in the current quarter, and its average storage size per unit is up as well.With the dark cloud of earnings uncertainty in the rear-view mirror (Seagate has reported declines in HDD shipments in prior quarters; this one was the first reversal), Seagate has plenty of room for its valuation to correct upward as it continues to harvest cash from its maturing HDD business. Nor is Seagate sitting still and waiting for the HDD market to slowly peter out - it’s part of the Bain consortium to purchase the NAND division of Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY). While HDDs will continue to form its core business, it’s not turning a blind eye to SSD either.Despite Seagate’s recovery, the stock still trades at cheap multiples. The prospect of further recovery to “normal” valuations as well as a 7% yield to reward investors for their patience makes Seagate an extremely attractive portfolio choice.STX EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsHDD shipments for Q1 totaled 70.3 million exabytes, up 5% y/y. One exabyte is equal to one billion gigabytes (GB). Of these shipments, 27.2 million exabytes were sold to enterprise customers - as I've noted previously, Seagate is the leading supplier of HDD products to enterprise customers; this quarter's shipments reinforce its leading position.As a refresher, the company shipped only 62 million total exabytes in Q4. This surprise turnaround and return to growth in the HDD business had a positive trickle effect throughout the rest of Seagate's financials. The company also achieved a record-high capacity per drive shipment, with the average drive carrying 1.9 terabytes.Despite higher shipment volumes, revenues shrank 6% y/y to $2.63 billion, presumably driven by increased pricing pressures in the storage market for end providers - though this is not unique to just HDD storage products. As a result, gross margins dropped by approximately 1%.Still, however, Seagate's revenue beat consensus expectations by a whopping $110 million, as analysts had mostly penciled in a continuation of the HDD shipment declines.Despite its shrinking revenue base and slightly contracting gross margins, Seagate has been able to cut down its operating expenses by 14% - well ahead of the revenue decline. As a result, operating income actually grew 15% to $255 million, up from $221 million in the prior year Q1.The company continues to seek additional cost-savings opportunities, and the CFO made the following comments on the earnings call (taken from Seeking Alpha's transcript):Pro forma operating expenses stood at $400 million in this Q1 release, signaling that the company intends to squeeze ~200bps of additional cost improvements by the end of December.Pro forma EPS of $0.96 resoundingly beat consensus of $0.85.From an operational standpoint, looking forward, the company expects to see continued growth in the enterprise segment as customers scale up their storage capacity needs. It expects sequential total revenue growth of 3-5% in Q2 (though not too much can be read into the sequential growth number, as the December quarter is commonly a heavy period for IT spending). However, this sequential growth figure is better than that achieved last year - so the return to growth and momentum in the business is truly refreshing.The company has also affirmed it ""expects to enter"" a long-term supply relationship with Toshiba, which will further its growth initiatives in SSDs.There are certainly many things to like about Seagate’s kickoff to fiscal 2018. First and foremost is the stabilization of the HDD market, which is the primary driver behind the company’s surging stock price post-earnings. Despite the overall HDD market leveling off, Seagate seems to have found its niche end-markets - particularly, enterprise storage - and it is predicting a strong demand environment, which gives it confidence in its sequential growth targets for Q2.Furthermore, Seagate’s non-HDD business is providing some lift to the company’s top line, despite revenue declines in the HDD business. The company disclosed $244 million in non-HDD revenue (nearly 10% of its top line in Q1, which was growing at 17% y/y). While the growth in this segment won’t make or break any quarter’s results, as this segment continues to grow (especially with a renewed focus on SDD thanks to Toshiba), non-HDD revenues will continue to play a more important role in hitting financial targets.Also worthy of mention is that Seagate has succeeded in aligning its cost structure to the new demand environment for HDDs. The company knows that the HDD business is past its prime, and that it must turn its attention to harvesting the business for cash. Despite a decline on the top line, Seagate was still able to increase operating income by 15% - truly a remarkable feat for a company that's in the thick of reinventing itself.Pessimists typically claim that high-dividend stocks (5% and above) sport high yields for a reason - the market is essentially saying they don't expect those yields to hold. Yet, Seagate's Q1 print has done nothing to signal to the market that its operating income or dividend is at risk - rather, the company has improved its operating income and shown stabilization in its core HDD business.With a 7% yield and the opportunity for further growth once pessimism on the name dies down, even after its post-earnings lift, Seagate looks like a safe, high-return income stock for either a dividend or growth portfolio."
4094861,20256,2017-08-04T09:39:28-04:00,Reviewing the past week in our technical models.Franchise durability impacts market prices.Changing market conditions can dramatically impact the value of a franchise.Consider your time frame and exposure to risk.,"The Stock Exchange is all about trading. Each week we do the following:We also have some fun. We welcome comments, links, and ideas to help us improve this resource for traders. If you have some earnings season ideas, please join in!Our last Stock Exchange took a closer look at big moves in the retail sector, as well as the opportunities and challenges they create. If you missed it, a glance at your news will show that the key points remain relevant.According to Oxford Dictionaries, a franchise is defined as:Understanding a company’s franchise value can be critically important to traders, particularly when broad market conditions are changing. What might be a terrific franchise in some market environments can be a terrible franchise under different circumstances. More specifically, if your franchise is authorized to carry out only certain activities, but the market is changing so those activities are no longer in demand, then the value of your franchise isn’t what it used to be.And here is what Warren Buffett had to say about franchise value:However, tastes, mental associations and service availability can all change over time (i.e. they’re not always “durable”). And it is in these periods of change that some of the best trading opportunities can be found.This week’s Stock Exchange is being edited by our frequent guest: Blue Harbinger (also known as Mark Hines). Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas focused on value and high-income opportunities (for example, check out the high-yield contrarian ideas in Blue Harbinger’s most recent Blue Harbinger Monthly). And this week’s diverse group of model picks are being tied together under the theme of “franchise value.” In particular, the franchise value of each of this week’s picks is being impacted significantly by current market conditions.Road Runner: My most recent pick is Electronic Arts (EA). I look for stocks that are at the bottom of a rising trading channel and if you look at the chart below you can see why I like Electronic Arts. It’s been in a steady rising channel since May and has just pulled back in the channel to $116.92. I expect the price of EA to rise back to the top of the channel, but it will only hold that position for so long.Blue Harbinger: I believe Electronic Arts dominant franchise in sports video games (e.g. Madden 18, NBA Live 18, and FIFA 18) will give it a steady flow of healthy cash flows as it continues to release new highly-sought-after versions, year after year. However, I also realize EA is little expensive right now from a price-to-earnings standpoint, especially considering it’s still proving itself in the online and mobile gaming markets.RR: I really don’t care about fundamentals like P/E ratios and cash flows, but I can appreciate that EA isn’t the pick for everyone right now.BH: Just last week EA lowered sales guidance for 2018, but it’s still expected to grow. I think as long as the company continues to release new versions of its top selling games year-after-year, and assuming consumer preferences don’t change dramatically, the company will be fine over the long-term. I just believe given the recent price rally so far this year, combined with the high P/E ratio, now isn’t the best time for long-term investors to add shares.RR: That’s great that you’re considering the long-term value of the franchise, and our readers might care about that too, but I simply look at the chart and like what I see! How about you, Holmes, what have you got?Holmes: This week I like Northern Trust (NTRS). This stock’s dip two weeks ago is the sort of set up I like to see when sniffing out a good deal. From the chart below you can see NTRS is below its 50-day moving average, and reasonably priced relative to its 200-day moving average. It’s also received support at the $87.50-level. The price moving above the 50-day average at $92.40 would be encouraging. With limited downside and plenty of upside potential, I hope I’ve brought the humans a solid pick.BH: I believe Northern Trust is a decent buy at its current price for a couple reasons. First, rising interest rates help the business because of an improved net interest margin. And second, a rising stock market also helps the business because a large portion of its revenues depends on assets under administration/management. However, for full disclosure purposes, I may be biased because I worked at Northern Trust for several years, and I have a positive view of the company.H: Your subjective views and biases are exactly what I have been designed to avoid. Humans can be illogical, my decisions are based on objective data. My style is dip-buying mean reversion, my average holding period is six weeks, I exit when my price target is achieved, and I control risks based on macro factors and stops.BH: I also like Northern Trust because of its strong franchise value. It has a squeaky clean reputation that allows it to maintain its long list of ultra-high net worth wealth management clients. Northern Trust’s reputation is also enabling its continued focus on expanding business in the United Arab Emirates with its recent new branch office in Abu Dhabi.H: That’s all great, but I’ll stick to the hard data instead of the touchy-feely stuff.Felix: Seagate Technologies (STX) looks extremely “out of favor” right now, and to me, that’s what makes it attractive. The continued pullback since late April is signaling a bottom. As a long-term investor, that’s a very important factor. Have a look at this chart of the past 12 months.I’ll admit this does not read as a success story, though I still think it provides a useful entry point. I could easily see some recovery back up to the $37.50 mark, especially with my extended time frame.BH: Felix do you even know what Seagate does? Seagate is basically a hard disk drive producer, and with the ongoing proliferation of cloud computing and data centers, Seagate’s desktop and notebook PC hard disk drives seem like a very unattractive investment. This is a franchise that was very powerful only a few years ago, but with the continuing slow death of the PC and hard disk drives in favor of mobile and cloud-based computing, Seagate looks anemic to me.F: Okay, that’s interesting. However, I can tell you that I like the current price as an entry point and that I would be looking for a long-term holding. There are plenty of companies and stock prices that have made turnarounds, and I’d much rather buy something on sale than pay full price.BH: I can appreciate your frugalness, and I agree that companies can and do make turnarounds. In fact, Seagate is trying to capitalize on the big growth in data centers. Specifically, Seagate is investing in high-capacity storage devices to support cloud-based infrastructures. However, I just don’t think it’s going to be enough to offset the declining PC market. Seagate isn’t going out of business overnight, but unless something dramatic happens, it has a very uphill battle ahead.F: Fair enough, we shall see.Oscar: This week I bought into the healthcare sector, via the healthcare sector ETF (XLV). I like the sector because it has been exhibiting strong momentum, and based on recent volatility I can see some upside. BH: Healthcare has been interesting over the last 5 years starting with the US supreme court’s 2012 decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act, followed by more recent efforts to “repeal and replace” the law. We’ve even seen a lot more choppiness in the price of XLV very recently as Congress has tried and failed to change the law.O: I typically hold these position for about six weeks, and I usually exit by rotating into another sector.BH: If we consider the healthcare sector according to our earlier definition of a franchise (i.e. as “an authorization granted by a government or company to an individual or group enabling them to carry out specified commercial activities”) then the recent volatility you have described makes perfect sense. There is a lot of uncertainty in the healthcare sector right now, and based on how the laws change (or do not change) there will be winners and losers in the sector. For example, if efforts by some members of Congress to slow the growth in Medicaid reimbursement are successful, this will hurt some companies in the sector more than others. However, the overall demographics-driven need for healthcare continues to rise, and healthcare is likely a fairly decent long-term bet.O: That’s an interesting story, but again, I typically hold these position for only about 6-weeks, and the objective data is currently attractive.

4111099,102529,2017-10-02T12:47:17-04:00,"After a 35% price drop from Apr-17 highs ($50.96) and over 50% lower than Dec-14 highs ($69.40), Seagate Technology, currently valued at $33.17, might be considered as an opportunity.Given its deteriorating business performance and long-term strategic and product-obsolescence concerns, it is possible that Seagate may turn out to be a value trap.The fact that a declining technology firm is the topic of discussion, about its dividend yield and especially dividend payout, should be a concern on its own.Investors should not focus on dividend but rather on margin-of-safety price levels resulting from overreaction associated with the threat of potential product obsolescence and substitution.","After a period of extreme outperformance against major equity-market benchmarks since 2009, positive performance for Seagate Technology (STX) reversed (after Dec-2014) and a price drop of approximately 50% followed. As a result, and given the generous dividend policy and attractive valuation metrics of the stock, dividend-oriented investors and value hunters are paying close attention.Figure 1. Seagate Stock Price and VolumeOn the other hand, given idiosyncratic company issues with deteriorating revenue and prospects, as well as the questionable corporate strategy over the last year, there is a significant short interest even after the considerable correction that has already taken place. The situation clearly reflects major concerns about the future of the company and its ability to generate positive cash flows in a sustainable manner and of course, high enough to support present-level dividend payout.For those not familiar with the company, Seagate Technology is a provider of electronic data storage equipment and solutions. The Company focuses on the production of hard disk drives (HDDs) and to a lesser extent, solid state drives, solid state hybrid drives, and others. Its storage technology portfolio also includes storage subsystems and high-performance computing solutions. Its products are designed for applications related to enterprise servers and storage systems, client compute applications and client non-compute applications. Seagate designs and fabricates various components found in its disk drives, including read/write heads and recording media.Table 1. Product and Geographic SegmentationAlready analyzed by many authors on SA and elsewhere, the dominance of solid state storage devices (SSDs) in the PC and portable-device markets over the last years has become a major headwind to Seagate which focuses on traditional storage devices (HDDs) which, thankfully for Seagate, remain the optimal solution for large-scale storage infrastructures. However, investors with a long-term focus should be concerned about how long will HDDs be the optimal solution for a market starving for speed (and innovative solutions) in a rapidly expanding society of information. Those thinking or arguing that the company has optimally positioned itself in the “big-data” market, not yet in risk by alternative products, can take a look at Figure 2. Obviously, it is very difficult to say how Seagate’s current strategy and position can make a positive difference if significant changes will not take place.Figure 2. Revenue and Units Sold (Fiscal Quarters)Although our expertise and information available does not allow us to make any (quantitative) predictions about the exact short- and medium-term conditions in the digital-storage market, we are confident that a technology firm operating in a rapidly changing environment which does not invest heavily (and adapts) but bases its strategy on the path of a relatively “stable” environment will not generate sufficient returns for its shareholders if it is lucky enough to survive. In a competitive environment, any business that does not invest a significant part of its generated cash flow is likely to fail sooner or later let alone a company manufacturing and selling technological products.It is not a coincidence that the stock price of the main competitor Western Digital (WDC) has increased more than 50% over the last 12 months compared to a drop of 8% for Seagate (in total return terms). In what follows, we have also included information for other three companies operating in the same space, NetApp (NTAP), Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD), and Quantum Corporation (QTM-OLD) not for direct comparisons but for indications about how the overall sector is performing.Table 2. Total ReturnsHopefully, Seagate executives have realized the situation of falling revenue and secular changes in the market they operate and will soon (if not already) make the necessary efforts to create value for the shareholders. Just a few days ago, the Company announced its participation in the consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that entered into an agreement with Toshiba to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation. Seagate has committed to provide up to $1.25 billion (80% of FY17 free cash flow, three times FY17 capital expenditures) in financing to support the acquisition which is expected by March 2018. What is more, the Company expects to enter into a long-term NAND-supply agreement with Toshiba Memory a favorable development for Seagate's expanding SSD product portfolio. As a result, Seagate expects this transaction to improve its earnings prospects, an expectation which, however, does not seem to be reflected in the stock price given the recent performance.As we can see in the figure below, over the last few months, Seagate’s stock has experienced significant selling pressure as reflected in our index “Buying / Selling Pressure” based on price changes and volume. This is an index focusing on mid- to long-term horizons and aims to capture accumulation and distribution. One can use this index by focusing on trends, regime shifts as well as “divergences,” a popular approach used by followers of technical analysis to spot peaks and troughs. A possible entry point could result in a positive divergence, i.e., the stock price is experiencing new lows while the indicator is not.Figure 3. Buying / Selling Pressure (240-days Horizon)The recent weak stock performance is also reflected in the analysis based on highest highs and lowest lows of 20 and 60 (trading) days, a set of indices commonly known as Donchian Channels which is used by trend followers. Although a technical indicator of questionable results, it can be used to provide us with an idea about how this subset of market participants may be or how will be positioned in the stock. Focusing on short-term, the indicator has generated a “buy” signal. Clearly, the stock remains in a “selling” or “short selling” regime in the longer horizon of 60 days.Figure 4. Donchian Channels, Highest Highs and Lowest Lows of 20 and 60 DaysNegative investor sentiment for Seagate is more than evident in short interest, which is approximately 15% (analysis starts from 2004 for comparison purposes).Figure 5. Days-to-Cover Ratio and Short Interest as % of Equity FloatFor comparison purposes, in the table that follows, we can see short interest data for rival Western Digital as well as the rest of the three companies operating in the same sector. The average short interest of the S&P 1500 companies is approximately 6.9%.Table 3. Days-to-Cover Ratio and Short Interest as % of Equity FloatIt is known that stocks with high short interest should be approached with caution yet, not necessarily avoided at all cost. Very often, short sellers do not act on solid fundamentals but rather, on momentum and sentiment. Many contrarian investors use short interest to predict stock price direction based on the idea that if “everyone” is a seller then the price has already reached very low levels and thus, the risk/reward ratio is attractive. In this case, high short interest for Seagate clearly suggests market concerns mainly about cash flow developments and prospects which, in classic asset pricing theory, are of “permanent” nature and to a lesser extent cyclical factors that most of the times create opportunities.On the other hand, the fact that the Days to Cover Ratio is close to 8 (6.5 for the S&P 1500) suggests that should positive news or earnings surprises for the stock arrive and materialize, short sellers will face difficulties covering their positions at desired price levels a possible situation that option traders focusing on earnings announcements should consider. There is no doubt that over the last years, Seagate, as the rest of the companies in the BI Global Index of Computer Hardware and Storage companies (maintained by Bloomberg) operates in a declining environment.Figure 6. Sales Growth and Capital EfficiencyEvidently, the most significant weakness of the company lies in its ability to grow or even maintain revenue growth above zero. Unfortunately, this results in falling earnings and cash flow directly affecting the valuation of the company in the traditional DCF way. As it turns out from Table 4, Seagate does not invest less than Western Digital relative to its revenue a fact reflecting the qualitative nature of the strategic weakness. However, one should take into consideration the acquisition of SanDisk for $19 billion by Western Digital back in 2016, a huge investment not only in relative but also in absolute terms which apparently drives up Western Digital’s growth rates yet is not reflected in CapEx/Sales figure in Table 4.Table 4. Sales Growth and Capital ExpendituresAs it is evident from the figure that follows, Seagate was and still appears to be overpriced in terms of sales and book value relative to the other companies in the sector although no direct comparisons should be made. Yet, divergences of this magnitude should be of concern given the idiosyncratic characteristics of the company. As far as book value is concerned, we note that over the last years it has been reduced substantially because of significant dividend payments. In terms of P/E and P/CF, Seagate has appeared cheaper most of the time since the beginning of the specific sample.Figure 7. Valuation MetricsIn Table 5, we report basic valuation metrics for both reported and estimated sales, earnings and cash flows. There is no doubt that Seagate appears “cheap” if one takes valuation metrics at face value. On the one hand, current price may be the result of overreaction to bad news regarding (current) cash flows. On the other hand, current price may discount lower future cash flows a situation reflecting a value trap. Unless significant actions and efforts are taking place to improve business prospects, the latter is more likely given the dynamics in the industry.Table 5. Valuation MetricsIn terms of profitability, it appears that Seagate is successful in improving its margins over the last few years as a result of the recent restructuring. However, significant value for the shareholders will be realized if the management of the company will also succeed in improving revenue growth rates otherwise the effect of improving margins is not sufficient to match the effect of falling sales.Figure 8. Profitability MetricsCompared to Western Digital, Seagate is doing a better job controlling expenses and improving net margin.Table 6. Profitability MetricsIn terms of capital efficiency, it turns out that Seagate has experienced a significant deterioration since 2013 a situation which has started to improve lately.Figure 9. Capital Efficiency MetricsCompared to Western Digital, the capital efficiency of Seagate is noteworthy. However, one should be very cautious and consider the different prospects of the two firms and most importantly, the acquisition of SanDisk which doubled the assets of Western Digital and significantly changed its capital structure.Table 7. Capital Efficiency MetricsIn terms of liquidity and leverage, we note the gradually increasing debt of Seagate and the extreme change in the capital structure of the company resulted from the significant dividend payouts which brought down equity. For conservative, dividend-oriented investors this is not a very favorable situation since we are not living in the frictionless world of the Modigliani-Miller (Capital Structure) Irrelevance Theorem. In general, increasing debt levels with decreasing revenue is a story that most conservative (if not rational) investors seeking to fund their retirement should not invest in unless the expected return really compensates for the risks assumed.Figure 10. Liquidity and Leverage MetricsOn the other hand, Western Digital increased its debt considerably, not to pay dividends, but to acquire SanDisk with the prospect of significant revenue, earnings and cash-flow growth.Table 8. Liquidity and Leverage MetricsSeagate’s stock price has experienced a significant price drop over the last three years of approximately 50% a fact which, after considering the company’s generous dividend and current valuation, might be considered as an opportunity from an income and value/contrarian viewpoint. However, significant uncertainty characterizes not only the next-quarter results but the overall future of the company given its focus on products that may become obsolete or substituted by better alternatives. In addition, there are not any robust indications about how the Company will respond to technological shifts and the cost and time of changes (if any).In the short-term, negative performance may continue because of the previously-described concerns and (further) deteriorating fundamentals. Given recent experience following earnings announcements, options traders should keep an eye on implied volatility for attractive volatility-buying opportunities. At the end of the day, this is probably the right way to approach STX at the moment.From a fundamental viewpoint, future stock price performance will depend heavily on the normalization of business results and the ability of the company to maintain the required positive cash flow to pay relatively high dividends. Rising interest rates may be a significant factor not only for discounting purposes but also for debt refinancing as well as new financing needs given the negative credit outlook and the increasing leverage of the Company. A recession and/or a market-wide correction will most likely have a significant impact on the stock.Overall, the possibility of investing in Seagate Technology should be assessed with great caution given the mature status of the company and decreasing revenue. There is a big possibility that Seagate will turn out to be a value trap in its adjustment to an environment of lower demand for its products and challenges regarding future direction."
4103866,103480,2017-09-04T00:02:11-04:00,"Seagate Technology, the #1 vendor of enterprise hard disk drives and #2 vendor in overall hard drives, sports a juicy 8% yield.The year-on-year decline in hard drive unit sales and pricing is flattening due to substitution away from scarcer and higher-priced NAND-based solid state drives.The company has skillfully managed the down-cycle in the hard drive industry, increasing gross margins and cutting opex, ultimately delivering increased earnings.As trends in the industry stabilize, a leaner and more profitable Seagate will see a return to growth and is more than capable of supporting its high dividend.","Seagate Technology plc (NASDAQ:STX), the Dublin-based maker of computer storage products, has seen better days. The stock has cratered from a high of $50 in early 2017 to the low $30s today, leaving many investors to ask: ""What happened?""The primary answer is SSDs, or solid state drives, threatening the company's traditional strength in hard drives (we'll get into the technical differences a little later). SSDs, prized for their computing speed, are deployed in almost all consumer-facing products today, including phones, tablets, and laptops. This explosion in SSD demand, however, has led to a worldwide shortage in NAND flash (the primary component in SSDs) and price spikes, leaving the lower end of the market open to cheaper hard disk drives (HDDs).Nevertheless, the market has a short-term orientation, and SSD competition ate into Seagate's fiscal year, disappointing investors and sending the stock spiraling down. See the stock's YTD chart below:STX data by YChartsIn the month of August, Seagate tested 52-week lows multiple times and found support at $30. Bear in mind that at this price, the stock trades at ~12x trailing P/E and less than 10x forward consensus EPS of $3.69, according to Yahoo Finance's average of 28 covering analysts.This creates a perfect setup for a value investor looking to pick up shares of a technology leader at a bargain price and earn a stable 8% yield for their patience (note that outside of the recession years, Seagate has paid and increased its dividend since 2003, and it has successfully managed through many cycles in the turbulent computer memory industry). While hard drives may not be the newest or sexiest technology, its price advantage ensures it will never become obsolete. SSDs and HDS can coexist in the market, much in the same way that Costco (NYSE: COST) and Whole Foods can; the availability of a superior product does not doom the survival of its cheaper cousins. And in the lower-cost realm, Seagate has a marked advantage.We'll start with the elephant in the room: What's the biggest difference between HDDs and SSDs, and what drives the purchasing decision toward one over the other?Both hard drives and solid state drives perform the non-volatile storage function in both personal devices and enterprise servers, meaning that data written in the drive doesn't vanish when the system is powered off, as is the case with RAM memory. When you see that something has 512GB of storage, that's provided by either an HDD or an SDD or a combination known as a hybrid.Hard drives operate on the classic spinning disk mechanism, with a read/write function that accesses data on a magnetic spinner. Solid state drives, however, provide memory in the form of a compact, interconnected flash chip, commonly installed in the motherboard of a PC or server.SSDs are noticeably faster than hard drives, but the high demand for these chips by a wide variety of end products - smartphones, tablets, laptops, and enterprise servers - have caused a global shortage in NAND chips (which are used to make SSDs) and driven up prices. This can be easily illustrated in the chart below:Figure 1. SSD prices (64GB), 18 monthsSource: PCPartPickerAccording to the chart above, the prices of 64GB chips have nearly doubled since early 2016.Meanwhile, in the same time frame, hard disk prices have remained in flat or slow decline:Figure 2. HDD prices (1TB), 18 monthsThe memory industry is extremely cyclical, and pricing trends tend to whiplash from time to time. Today's pricing, however, creates an advantage in HDD for the cost-conscious buyer. If performance is of secondary concern, buyers will note the increase in SSD prices versus the decline in HDD prices and lean toward the more cost-effective HDD.Why would performance and speed be unimportant, though? Haven't we become impatient creatures, always demanding split-second boot times and seamless app performance?Consumers' demand for zippy performance has led to the popularity of SSDs in personal devices. But enterprises are not made the same way - they have to handle boatloads of data, most of which is nonessential. According to a study done by IDC, in 2025 we will be creating 10x more data annually: a stunning 163ZB per year, up from 16ZB in 2016.Most of this data can be considered data at rest: information that's good to know, but not necessary to access 24/7. For example, our connected cars might generate data on when the last oil (or battery) change was performed, giving car companies an idea of the age of the existing fleet; or Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) might want to store data on how many senior citizens purchased a Frappucino.There's a wealth of data to be stored, and storing them all via SSD chips is prohibitively expensive. Many enterprises are choosing the HDD route to store their non-critical data, and this is the realm in which Seagate reigns supreme.Now that we've discussed HDD's competition against SSD, we can turn to what competition Seagate faces within the HDD market.Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is the overall leader in HDD, and it's the larger company ($19 billion in revenues versus Seagate at $11 billion). The company has an aggressive inorganic growth strategy, expanding deeper into NAND territory by purchasing chipmaker SanDisk for $19 billion in 2016. Last week, Western Digital also announced that it will be acquiring Tegile Systems, another flash memory provider. Tegile's private valuation is unknown, but as a Series E company with $175 million in total funding, its acquisition price is likely close to $1 billion.Acquisitions have made Western Digital the big dog in HDD, shipping 175 million exabytes of hard disk storage compared to Seagate's 155 million, according to TRENDFOCUS. This implies an overall market share of 41% for Western Digital and 37% for Seagate.In the enterprise space, however, Seagate edges out over its rival. Seagate has a 50% market share in enterprise, while Western Digital holds only 38% (the distant third player is Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF)).As discussed in the prior section, I believe enterprise is more resistant to the shift toward expensive NAND-based SSDs. With data volumes exploding, companies need a cost-effective way of warehousing their Big Data, and SSDs are not the answer to every class of data.With smartphones and other mobile devices becoming larger and larger in terms of memory capacity, the global NAND shortage seems likely to persist. This trend will continue to support enterprise IT demand for cheaper, durable hard drives that can maintain large data lakes - the area that Seagate knows best.Let's start by looking at Seagate's top line.Figure 3. Revenue and gross margins2016 was a bad year for the company, as unit shipments of hard drives fell hard. 2017, however, saw a stabilization in revenue decline. While prices still fell, Seagate shipped an increase in exabyte units and arrested a portion of the decline. It delivered an 18% y/y increase in exabyte shipments, having delivered four straight quarters of y/y unit shipment increases, illustrating that there is no failure of demand for hard drives. Seagate's enterprise revenues (slightly more than a third of the business) actually rose, offsetting the decline in the wider company.Most notably, gross margin expanded 600bps in 2016, so despite a lower revenue base, Seagate generated $3.2 billion in gross margin dollars in 2017, up 21% from $2.6 billion in 2016. The company was able to achieve significant gross margin improvements, despite overall price erosion in the hard drive market, by improving its factory utilization and reducing its workforce to drive a leaner operation.It also effectively managed operating expenses in 2017, bringing down both product development and admin costs in 2017 to deliver a stronger operating margin. While the company hasn't fully recovered from the crush of 2016, it's on the path to stabilization.Figure 4. Operating marginDue primarily to gross margin expansion, operating income and margins rebounded healthily in 2017. Net income and EBITDA improved as well, as shown below:Figure 5. Net income, EBITDA, and dividendsOf course, this is the main question on value investors' minds: Can Seagate maintain its stunning dividend? Yields above 5% are suspicious and often a sign that the market believes the dividend is doomed to crater.Dividata ranks Seagate's Dividend History as a perfect 5 and its Dividend Stability at 5 as well. It has consistently paid a dividend since 2003 (except for the recession years in 2009-2010) and has increased the dividend at least every two years without ever cutting it. The company has shown a willingness (as seen above in 2016) to maintain the dividend even in troubled years.Consensus estimates on Seagate point to an average EPS forecast of $3.69 for the year ending June 2018, implying a reasonably forward payout ratio of 68%. Even if earnings stumble, the company has sufficient liquidity to foot the dividend bills - it has $2.5 billion in cash, nearly enough to cover 5x 2017's total dividend payments.As markets rebound to all-time highs, shaking off macro disturbances such as North Korea and Hurricane Harvey, stock selection becomes of utmost importance. Value is truly difficult to find in today's market, least of all in technology. Seagate, on the other hand, offers investors a high dividend yield, coupled with the chance to profit from a rebound in the hard disk space.STX data by YChartsWith Seagate trading at bargain basement values of 8.4x forward P/E and 5.7x forward EBITDA, it's a solid choice for patient investors willing to wait on long-term trends to improve.When choosing rebound plays, the selection of market leaders is paramount. Seagate is the largest vendor of hard drives in the enterprise market, with a large lead over Western Digital. With pricing trends stabilizing in the HDD market and persistently high prices in SSD causing a shift into lower price tiers, the company is well positioned to reward investors with income and growth."
4093185,21702,2017-08-01T13:04:56-04:00,"The two largest domestic hard disk drive manufacturers appear to have diverging futures.Western Digital's strategic takeover of San Disk gives it a big advantage (i.e. NAND) over Seagate.As a result, Western Digital will use that advantage to hit Seagate where it hurts: HDD margins.","According to IDC, the global hard disk drive (or HDD) storage market is dominated by three companies: Toshiba (TOSBY), Western Digital (NYSE:WDC), and Seagate Technology (STX):For full-year 2016, Western Digital retained the No. 1 spot in terms of both total unit sales and total petabytes shipped. That said, both Toshiba and Seagate nibbled away at WDC's market share as shown in the graphic above. But from the larger perspective, the HDD market exhibited flat year-over-year revenue growth and declining unit volumes.The real action is in the solid state disk (or SSD) market where companies that have NAND manufacturing capability (i.e. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Toshiba, and Western Digital) have a distinct advantage over those that do not. Which is why you don't see Seagate listed among the leaders in SSD market share:Western Digital's bold move to acquire SanDisk last year gave it an immediate and significant presence in the SSD market. It is second only to Samsung in SSD's and a few percentage points ahead of No. 3 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).So what happens to Seagate Technology going forward? My guess is the company will face (and is already facing) increasing margin pressure on its HDD product offerings as Western Digital is able to flex its muscles in the NAND market and offer compelling and total system level solutions (i.e. a mix of NAND, SSD, and HDD technology) for the rich and growing cloud and enterprise markets.The diverging futures of the two companies were exhibited in the recent Q2 (fiscal Q4) EPS reports (see STX, WDC). Comparisons of slides from the two companies' quarterly presentations are informative:Source: Seagate's Quarterly Supplemental InformationSource: Western Digital Quarterly Fact SheetQuarter-over-quarter Seagate's revenue and EPS were down, the later down sharply. Gross margin was 27.7%.For WDC, quarter over quarter revenue was up, and EPS of $0.93/share was up from $0.83 in the prior quarter. On the quarterly conference call, WDC reported non-GAAP gross margin of 41% - up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 950 basis points year-over-year. And this will be Seagate's problem going forward - and WDC will be the beneficiary.As a result, the YTD stock performance of the two companies are diverging, with WDC headed up, Seagate headed down:Source: Google FinanceI suspect this stock divergence between the two companies to continue based on the strength of WDC's strategic positioning in NAND, and therefore in the SSD market.Summary and ConclusionDon't fall for Seagate's dividend yield (7.6%) vs. WDC's (2.3%). The companies are headed in opposite directions. While the Toshiba NAND sale narrative changes on a near daily basis, the fact is that WDC's position in the Toshiba joint venture puts them at an advantage against any other potential suitor. And while the stock prices of both STX and WDC declined after the quarterly results were released, WDC's stock declined in the face of a beat and full-year earnings guidance of $12/share. I reiterate my buy rating on WDC. The pullback in the stock is a great buying opportunity for those who want to establish a position. WDC could eclipse its old high (set back in 2014) by year-end."

The problem for long-term investors remains the volatile disk drive business, but do investors have a cryptocurrency cushion this time around?While storage demands continue to explode, Seagate Tech has continuously struggled to sell their products for premium prices leading to stagnating sales. Revenues have been in continual decline since the peak in 2012.Source: Rocket Financial Analysts forecast FY18 sales of $10.3 billion so the trend isn't about to improve. The good part of the equation is that Seagate Tech consistently generates free cash flows allowing for large capital returns.The tech company currently pays a 5.5% dividend yield and repurchases shares on a regular basis. The net payout yield that combines the dividend yield and the net stock buyback yield sits around 9.5%.STX data by YChartsThe large yield was recently one of the top 5 in the market. The one major hiccup with the yield is that Seagate Tech has consistently added debt in the last few years to repurchase shares.The net debt position is now at $2.7 billion, which is creeping up for a stock only worth $12.4 billion. In the last quarter, the company returned $350 million to shareholders while only generating $237 million in cash from operations.STX Net Total Long-Term Debt (Quarterly) data by YChartsSuch moves aren't sustainable over the long term. The company though might have an answer to this cash flow strain.As news emerges that Seagate Tech has a large investment in cryptocurrency, the company might eventually be able to easily repay that debt. This might also explain why the company has recently spent more on capital returns than cash flow.According to an excellent report from ValueStreet Research on this site, Seagate has a large financial interest in Ripple. The cryptocurrency has surged this year though the digital coin is down an incredible 25% today to $2.54. ValueStreet used $3 for their analysis or about a 15% hit.Source: Coinmarketcap.comValueStreet placed a valuation of $7.8 billion on the Ripple investment, but Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini issued a cautionary note. The analyst suggests the actual position is in Ripple Labs and not the currency. The analyst though suggests the position has a value between $2.5 billion and $5 billion. The ValueStreet estimate dips to $6.6 billion based on the current XRP price.The numbers aren't immediately clear on what Ripple price Hosseini uses for the valuation, but the analyst appears to downplay a position that could equate to somewhere in excess of 25% of the current market cap of Seagate Tech.In all fairness, the analyst has a $39 price target on the stock that started the week at $43 and is now up at $46. The negative update could be a way of protecting a call that is already on the wrong side.The key investor takeaway is that Seagate Tech offers a reasonable value for the risk. Analysts forecast a EPS steady around $4 per share making the stock reasonably valued at $46 with all of the cryptocurrency benefit as pure upside.In the meantime, the company can continue generating solid free cash flow and returning extra capital to shareholders with the Ripple Labs investment paying off in a big way whether the asset is liquid or not. The large net payout yield appears solid at these levels."
4102242,22786,2017-08-28T08:25:46-04:00,"Like with GameStop, Seagate's dividend is high but sustainable
        Demand for high-capacity storage is strong
        Compelling value in Seagate discussed","Seagate Technology (STX) disappointed investors when the company reported poor quarterly earnings last month. At a share price of $31.25, the stock now offers a dividend that yields a seemingly unsustainable 8.06 percent. Similarly, GameStop (GME) reported weak results and its stock fell. Investors are questioning the electronic gaming retailer’s dividend yield sustainability of 7.84%. But for Seagate, the company’s stock price is in danger of falling lower due to its future prospects. Worries over the impact of a dividend cut on its share price are secondary.Seagate commanded around 40% of the hard disk market share in 2016. It lost a few points earlier this year and is in danger of losing more if Western Digital’s (WDC) deal to control the chip unit from Toshiba succeeds. Despite the headwinds, Seagate is optimistic. It expects to get half the Exabyte share (10TB – 12TB market) by the end of this year. Cloud storage and hyperscale markets continue to grow. This will drive hard drive demands. Management is comfortable with the HDD product mix and believes the storage sizes (from 2TB and up to 16TB) will satisfy customer needs.In the fiscal fourth-quarter, Seagate reported a healthy gross margin of 29.5%. It generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations:With 289.7 million shares outstanding and a dividend of $2.52/share, Seagate has plenty of cash flow to cover the current dividend. The company also has around $8.80 per share in cash. The company forecasts next quarter’s revenue will be between $2.5 billion - $2.6 billion. Gross margin will match or improve at 29% to 33%. Operating costs will trend lower, from $415 million this quarter to $400 million or lower in the December quarter.Seagate’s mid-term risk is the customer demand shifting from mechanical HDDs to solid state drives (“SSD”). Markets already expect an acceleration in demand for SSD. Micron Technology (MU) is benefiting from strong prices for NAND. Its 3D Xpoint development, in partnership with Intel Corporation (INTC), will only accelerate the technology shift to high-speed I/O products. Seagate’s only move today is selling 4TB and 8TB mechanical drives for slow-access data storage and retrieval. PC upgrades may need SSDs for the primary drive for optimal performance. Fortunately, the shift towards cloud storage will sustain Seagate’s HDD business. Near-term, higher DRAM and NAND pricing is disrupting demand for large-capacity storage. Customers must balance the impact of higher memory costs and chips against storage purchases. As Intel refreshes its commercial CPUs, the high cost of the related components is hurting Seagate’s sales. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is disrupting the price to performance equilibrium previously dominated by Intel. As data centers and commercial customers install EPYC, AMD’s latest chip solution, saving on costs in the process, the customer will re-start its storage purchases. Western Digital did not report the same issue last quarter but it may have experienced lower-than-normal demand for HDDs in the current quarter. But WDC shareholders will not worry because strong SSD sales from its SanDisk unit will offset that risk.Seagate trades at a P/E of 12 times and a forward P/E of 8 times. Western Digital’s forward P/E is 7.8 times, even after the 8.5 percent weekly gain on the stock market. While I still find WDC stock more compelling than Seagate’s, the stock is unlikely to fall below $30. If it does, it should not stay there for too long. The world has a need for more storage and Seagate is one of the few suppliers.

4088388,24992,2017-07-18T09:38:43-04:00,"Shares are trading at a 40% discount to the overall market.Dividend has grown at an average rate of 54% per year since 2011.If we assume future dividend growth of 14% per year, our growth model shows a 19.50% total return on shares to 2020.ChartMasterPro upward target price of $44.00.","Shares of Seagate Technology are up about 37% over the past year, but the stock remains undervalued in my view. Investors with a long term horizon would be wise to invest at these levels in anticipation of more gains ahead. I’ll review my bullish thesis by highlighting some elements of the company’s financial history, along with the prospects for the dividend. I’ll conclude by talking briefly about the stock relative to this market.Financial SnapshotWhen reviewing the financial history of this firm over the past eight years, it becomes obvious that it is a relatively volatile business. An investor in this firm should not expect the smoothest of rides. For instance, both revenue and net income have been quite volatile over the better part of a decade, jumping by upwards of 35% from year to year, only to plummet again.That said, things seem to be on the upswing at the moment, as the most recent three quarters are much better than the same period a year ago. Specifically, net income and earnings per shares are up approximately 270% from the prior period and the dividend has increased 5% over the same time horizon.In the face of this rather volatile situation, management seems to have never lost sight of the fact that they are working for shareholders. Since 2010, they have returned approximately $12.5 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends ($9.5 billion from buybacks, the balance from dividends). In my view, this is critical as it demonstrates that management is aligned with my interests. In the absence of this alignment, even the most wonderful business will be a shareholder graveyard in my view.I actually feel rather good about the level of debt on the balance sheet as it turns out. Not only does the company have 27% of the debt outstanding in cash at the moment, but most of it (~80%) is due after 2020, which suggests to me that there’s little risk of a solvency or a liquidity crisis on the horizon. This helps me sleep at night, relatively comfortable that the dividend will not likely be cut anytime soon.Modelling The FutureSeagate’s financial history gives us some indication of what we can expect in the future in relatively broad strokes: some volatility, and a management team that does an excellent job of returning value to shareholders. Investors buy a future, though, and it would be a good idea to try to understand something about the future of a business. When it comes to predicting the future, I try to isolate the single variable that I consider to be the biggest “driver” of value, in this case the dividend.The dividend has grown at a CAGR of about 54% since 2011. In my view, it would be irresponsible to forecast this as a continued growth rate, so I’m going to suggest a more muted growth rate of perhaps 14% over the next three years. This is much more conservative an estimate, and is in keeping with the growth rate we’ve seen more recently.When I perform this exercise on Seagate, I infer a CAGR total return of about 19% over the next four years, which I consider to be adequate compensation for the volatility and the risk present. Further, I consider a medium term dividend growth forecast of about 14% to be reasonable in light of the fact that data storage requirements are expected to explode over the next eight years.Source: Seagate Investor PresentationTechnical SnapshotAs per our ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the trend for STX turned bullish when it closed above $38.50 on July 11. This signals a bullish breakout from a downtrend line which began on June 27. From here, we see the shares rising to $44.00 over the next three months.Today, we may buy STX call options, which will provide us with approximately 10x leverage on our long trade. Our initial stop loss exit signal will be a daily close below $37.00.For investors in the shares, we recommend you hold for three months or $44.00, whichever comes first. For longer-term investors (years not months), we believe STX is a solid addition to any dividend growth portfolio.ConclusionAs I’ve said many times, for better or worse, investors can not access the cash flows of a given company directly, but must instead buy the shares that trade in a public market. This can be both good and bad. On the plus side, the public markets sometimes form judgements about the quality of a business that have little relationship to the underlying company. It’s emotionally challenging, but when the crowd that makes up the market behaves in an irrational way, there’s a chance that we can make some money.This is the case currently with Seagate in my view. The crowd seems to be discounting this business excessively, perhaps worried about the sustainability of the dividend. The fact of the matter is, though, that the firm has paid about $10.48 per share in dividends since 2011, while earning just over 2.5 times that amount since 2011. Whatever the reason for the 40% discount to the overall market, the choice is plain in my view: these shares represent a bargain at these levels and investors would be wise to buy."
4090534,74295,2017-07-26T05:04:37-04:00,"Seagate shares closed Tuesday trading down more than 16% after reporting Q4 earnings.
        EPS missed badly, the CEO is on his way out, and free cash flow, as has become a recurring theme, did not cover the quarterly dividend payment.
        Guidance was sub-par as well, leaving STX's near-term future ambiguous.","Investors in Seagate Technology (STX) are likely experiencing déjà vu after the stock dropped more than 16% in Tuesday trading, which almost exactly mirrors the more than 16% decline in share price after the most recent prior earnings report for Q3 2017. The company reported Q4 2017 earnings that significantly underwhelmed expectations, missing badly on EPS, providing weak guidance, bidding adieu (again) to its CEO of 16 years, though not all at once, Steve Luczo, and failing to cover the dividend payment with organic free cash flow. While investors might not want to sell shares just yet, in my opinion the short-term picture looks bleak and the long-term picture even bleaker.As I know it will be a hot topic of discussion in the comments section, I'll preempt the inevitable ""you were wrong on STX before so you're wrong now too"" responses by saying, yes, I turned out to be incorrect on the stock in the $20 range and as it rose. All I ask is that readers look at the content of the article with an open mind, and if you disagree with my points that's perfectly alright. Let's just keep the focus of the discussion where it should be: on Seagate.I'll just quickly summarize the earnings report and then highlight the parts I think are most important to investors. Seagate reported Q4 revenue of $2.41 billion, a decline of 9% YoY and $160 million below consensus estimates, and EPS of $0.65, which missed estimates by a whopping 34 cents and fell by 4 cents YoY. Additionally, gross margin of 28.9%, while up 310 bps YoY, came in well below the 31% projected by management on the Q1 conference call.The primary pain point for this quarter was HDD revenue, which declined close to 10% YoY. Many bulls were hoping that the guidance that caused the big drop in Q3 would be conservative and a nice sandbag to beat in Q4, but this turned out to be wishful thinking. The only thing worse than bad quarter is a bad quarter that catches investors and the company by surprise, and this was one of the latter. Seagate's guidance didn't expect this type of weakness and therefore investor expectations were set much too high, leading to the sell-off we now see.Let's now discuss the two major points in this report, beginning with guidance for Q1 2018 and CY2017. As recently as Q3 2017, Seagate management were aiming for $4.50 in EPS for CY2017, a target that, if reached, would have been impressive and likely justified a higher valuation. However, we were treated to this statement in the Q4 CC, which all but dashes those hopes:It is still unclear whether Seagate believes Q4 will just be an aberration in the grand scheme of CY2017 or not, but management did admit that some of the weakness in the quarter was structural and not temporary. Regardless, if this quarter proves something it's that Seagate doesn't have great visibility going forward and its guidance should be taken with a grain of salt.On the Q1 2018 side, Seagate is guiding for revenues between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, a 9% decline YoY at the midpoint and well below consensus estimates of $2.72 billion, gross margin to be flat, and cash flow from operations to be up sequentially though no specifics were given. The weakness in Q4 appears to be leeching into Q1, making me skeptical of Seagate's prospects into FY2018.The second point I'd like to discuss, which is perhaps the topic I've talked about the most in regards to Seagate, is free cash flow and its relation to the dividend. For a while now, in fact all the way back to May 2016 in this article here, I've said that Seagate's dividend is unsustainable in the long-term and should be cut in favor of spurring growth through internal investment or acquisition. HDDs are dying out and unless Seagate makes a move Western Digital's (WDC) acquisition of SanDisk there seems little hope for the long-term future of the company as evidenced by the perpetual revenue declines (barring last quarter):Tack on a 9% decline for the current quarter and 9% decline at the midpoint for Q1 2018 and the trend is clear. The real danger is when Seagate's results get so low that free cash flow can't cover the dividend as was the case in Q4. The company generated just $139 million in free cash flow, about $50 million less than it paid out in dividends for the quarter. As we've seen recently, it is quite possible this quarter will be an isolated incident and Seagate will return to organically covering the dividend, but I think this is a taste of what the future holds should Seagate not cut the dividend in order to invest in itself.A dividend cut would hurt share price in the short-term and might anger some shareholders, but Seagate has to make a pivot or its business will continue to decline. Every passing year, HDDs become less competitive with comparable offerings like SSDs and more outdated for modern applications. Maybe the dividend can survive another few years, but that would be doing a disservice to the long-term prospects of the company in my opinion.I think at the current rate, the long-term future for STX isn't very bright. Those investors looking for a short-term dividend stock to cash in on might find shares attractive, but this is not a stock that one should be buying and holding for a few years in my opinion. But with Q4's dismal results and bleak guidance for Q1 2018 and CY2017, the short-term prospects of the stock are up in the air as well and I'm leaning towards the pessimistic viewpoint. EPS fell off a cliff, free cash flow was insufficient to cover payouts, and guidance only projects further pain, leading me to recommend against buying shares on this dip.Best of luck!If you want to stay up-to-date on my articles, you can Follow me by going to my author page or by clicking ""Follow"" at the top of this page.Thanks for reading!"
4085902,102841,2017-07-05T16:50:48-04:00,"Seagate shares were very volatile over the last 6 years.The reason for high volatility was the decline in revenue and operating margin.The decline will likely persist in the near future and therefore short-term outlook is weak.On the other hand, there is a positive long-term outlook favoring the demand for storage.When the company stabilizes the business, it will be a buy, in the meantime, it is just a hold.","Seagate (STX) is likely to face negative pressure in the short term due to further revenue and operating margin decline. On the other hand, the opportunity for the long term is imminent stemming from favoring trends in the industry. Internet of Things, which means digitalization, data collection and the general movement to cloud, is going to create yet further demand for the data storage where HDD products are to benefit. And so, Seagate is well positioned to outperform in the long term. However, the company needs to demonstrate the ability to profit from the positive industry trends and stabilize the deteriorating business fundamentals. Steve Luczo, the CEO of the company, highlighted cautious optimism for business model stabilization, but I would wait for 2018 outlook to confirm his words.High volatilitySeagate has been very volatile during the last six years. The shares advanced from low of $7.7 in 2011 to the peak of $69.4 in 2014. After that, it reversed the bullish momentum and declined to a bottom of $17 in 2016. Consequently, the shares reached a high of $50 in April this year.Source: www.finance.yahoo.comAnd so, the investors could see the shares increase nine-fold, decrease 75 percent, increase three-fold and decrease 25 percent to current levels in a matter of six years. These huge swings have been caused by huge volatility in underlying profitability.Profitability swingsThe revenue reached a peak of $14.9B in 2012. Since then, sales declined every year. And they are projected to decline further next year.Source: Seagate 10k's, Analyst ProjectionsSource: www.finance.yahoo.comThe decline in sales had a direct impact on the decline in operating margin. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 10.5% in 2012 to 20.2% projected for 2017.Source: Seagate 10-K'sThere is an exact inverse relationship between revenue and operating expenses. Therefore, further weakness in sales will put yet another pressure on the margin. On the other hand, the gross margin has been fluctuating from low 20’s to high 20’s and is projected to reach 30% in 2017. This is historically above average, and therefore, I expect there is a high probability of gross margin mean reversion in 2018. My assumption is that the gross margin profitability fluctuation is the result of cyclicality in the business. And therefore, as the gross margin expanded last year, it may contract next year. This is supported by the recent concerns that sent the stock to the downside with respect to HDD sales.Source: Seekingalpha.comIf the management confirms investors’ concern with respect to the weakness in HDD sales, the shares will continue decline. Therefore, I would like to wait for more clarity with respect to operating margin stabilization. Bulls have been favoring Seagate by low P/E ratio, high dividend yield, high cash flow generation, but even that has deteriorated recently.Cash flow generationDespite the weakness in operating margin, the company has been able to cover its dividend payments with the cash flow generated from the business. However, as the dividend increased and the operating margin decreased, the ability to cover the dividend decreased substantially. For instance, Seagate was generating enough cash to cover seven times higher dividend in 2012. However, last year, it was only one and half times. In 2017, the gross margin expanded and the ability increased slightly. But this excludes one dividend payment that Seagate skipped. Otherwise, it would be two times.Source: Seagate 10-K'sAs revenue is projected to decline further, it will put pressure on operating margin yet again. The gross margin is already above historical levels, and so it is unlikely it can expand meaningfully higher. Therefore, lower ability to cover dividend payments, further revenue decline and operating margin squeeze, as well as a potential reversal in gross margin, will potentially put pressure on equity in the short term. Therefore, I suspect another weakness in the shares following the outlook for 2018. Particularly, I would watch the $35 and $31 levels given they worked as a resistance on the way up. Despite the short-term weakness, the management highlights the strong industry fundamentals from the digitalization.Data age 2025Seagate management highlights that the society will create 163 zeta bytes of data till 2025. There is a strong movement towards data collection with respect to car industry automation, the rise of the artificial intelligence, further digitalization and the movement to cloud. More devices and artificial intelligence data learning will result in higher demand for enterprise data storage which will result in higher HDD storage needs.Source: Seagate 3Q Supplemental InformationThe company has been transforming and shifting its focus away from PC and flash business storage towards enterprise, and so the opportunity for Seagate is imminent. But the company needs to deliver stronger results to demonstrate it can profit from the positive industry trends. The reason is that the data collection, the movement to the cloud, digitalization has been already happening over the past 4 years. And yet, the revenue declined and the operating margin got squeezed. Therefore, the outlook for 2018 will be crucial to set the further trajectory in shares as it may confirm the business stabilization or further weakness.TakeawayThe key takeaway is that shares have been very volatile in recent years. The reason for the volatility was the fluctuation in profitability and partially the decline in revenue. The last year showed a sign of stabilization in operating margin. However, this was done through gross margin expansion that is now above historical average. If that will revert towards historical average, then the company may decline in the short term. On the other hand, there is a huge opportunity for the company long term from favoring industry trends. However, the company needs to deliver stronger results to demonstrate it can profit from those trends."
4063308,89805,2017-04-19T06:26:29-04:00,,"Many of the most popular high yield stocks are real estate investment trusts (REITs), master limited partnership (MLPs), and business development companies (BDCs). All of these industries are designed to pay very high dividends.When it comes to regular corporations, however, a very high dividend yield can be a warning sign that something is fundamentally flawed with the company's business model.Many of these companies tend to have relatively low Dividend Safety Scores, indicating that their dividends could be at risk of being cut in the future.Let's take a closer look at Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), which offers a high dividend yield above 5% and has paid higher dividends for six straight years, to see if the stock could be appropriate for our Conservative Retirees dividend portfolio.Business OverviewFounded in 1978 in Dublin, Ireland, Seagate Technology is one of the world's largest suppliers of data storage hardware, including hard drives, solid-state hybrid drives, solid-state flash-based drives, and memory cards.The company's products are found in everything, from PCs, mobile phones, tablets, and digital video recorders (DVRs) to cloud computing servers.However, Seagate's fortunes continued to be tied to its specialty, hard disk drives (HDDs), which is the industry it helped pioneer. HDDs are devices that store digital information on rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. They have been used in a number electronic devices, such as PCs, for decades.Business AnalysisUp until recently, Seagate was flying high on the boom in demand for data storage devices.While that demand continues to grow rampantly, the company is facing major challenges in growing its top and bottom line on two fronts.(Source: Simply Safe Dividends)First, the introduction of solid-state, NAND flash memory, or SSD technology, has really cut into Seagate's growth runway.Unlike hard drive memory storage, which involves a physically spinning magnetic medium, solid-state NAND memory has no moving parts. This makes it more reliable (less likely to break), far more energy-efficient, and also much faster to operate (instant on versus boot up).As a result, technology research firm Gartner forecast in early 2016 that enterprise SSD industry revenue could surpass HDD revenue this year.The second major challenge Seagate has faced is that it's operating in a fiercely competitive and highly commoditized market, one that is increasingly pressured by weakening demand for desktop computers as well.That results in weak pricing power, because increasing HDD production from low-cost rivals in Asia means the company is in a constant battle for market share, pressuring its margins and returns on shareholder capital.You can see that the overall disk drive market's revenue has shrunk over the past two years, while Seagate's market share (green bars) has also declined. Toshiba's (OTCPK:TOSBF) share gain was driven at least in part by its broad presence in both HDDs and SSDs, which makes it easier for customers to consolidate their business with one supplier.(Source: HotHardware.com)However, the news isn't all bad for Seagate. For example, while the data storage business may have razor-thin margins, the company has been able to generate better-than-average returns thanks to its economies of scale and aggressive cost-cutting efforts.(Source: Morningstar)In fact, management's dedication to disciplined capital spending is why Seagate still generates substantial free cash flow, which allows it to return cash to shareholders via aggressive buybacks (share count declining by 7.1% CAGR over the past nine years) and one of the market's most generous dividends.In addition, the overall market for data storage devices continues to grow at a torrid pace and is expected to rise to 1.181 million terabytes per year of shipments by 2020 (more than double 2015's shipments).(Source: Seagate Technology)The strong growth in data storage devices is due to a multitude of factors, including the rise of Big Data, artificial intelligence and machine learning, the growth of Internet of Things (including driverless cars), and cloud computing.In fact, the amount of data being generated per year is expected to rise almost 10-fold, from 16 zetabytes last year to 163 zetabytes (or 163 billion terabytes) by 2025.Increasingly, more and more of this data is being stored in the cloud, requiring massive growth in giant data farms.On a cost per GB basis, hard drives still have the upper hand, thanks to ongoing innovations by Seagate, such as heat-assisted magnetic recording.This technology uses a laser to heat the part of the disk that data is being written to, which increases the data density of the material. In other words, it allows the company to increase the capacity of its hard drives, and thus prolongs the length of time that HDDs will have a cost advantage over solid-state devices.However, it's important to remember that at some point, SSDs will likely come down in price enough to convince many of the world's data centers to switch to this competing technology.This is really the largest risk to long-term Seagate investors.Key RisksThe only reason that Seagate's business hasn't declined more in recent years is because the volume of data being generated by the world (and the need to store and analyze it) has grown so much faster than the improvements in SSD costs.However, remember that SSDs are generally superior to hard drive storage because their lack of moving parts makes them much faster, more reliable (longer lasting), and energy-efficient.At some point in the future, when SSDs become more cost-competitive with HDDs (which can only be improved so much based on physical limitations), the world's data centers are more likely to make the switch to run entirely on SSD-based server farms. That's especially true because SSD servers would be able to last far longer and consume vastly less power.Considering that U.S. data centers are expected to consume 73 billion Kilowatt hours of power by 2020 (about 2% of all the electricity used in the U.S., which is enough to power 6.7 million American homes), improving the energy efficiency, and thus, cost effectiveness, of data centers is a secular trend that will only continue.Can't Seagate simply transition to SSD-based technology? The answer is complicated, but over time, the company will be forced to evolve toward an entirely solid-state business model if it wants to survive.However, the problem is that its expertise is in hard drives, and it doesn't seem to have a competitive advantage in SSD. In fact the company outsources its NAND flash solid state memory from Micron Technologies (NASDAQ:MU), specifically because it wants to minimize the high fixed costs that come with manufacturing this superior but more expensive form of memory storage.That's in contrast to major rival Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC), which acquired SanDisk in 2016 for $16 billion specifically because it was one of the world's leading producers of solid-state memory.In other words, Seagate is at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to the long-term future, precisely for the kind of short-term cost-cutting efforts it is currently pursuing (outsourcing SSD production) in order to stem the decline in its bottom line.It is also a vertically integrated HDD manufacturer, making it more challenging and costly for the company to change directions.As a result, Seagate's dividend is likely to come under increasing pressure and even face risk of being cut or suspended entirely over the coming years.Seagate's Dividend SafetyWe analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend.Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question, ""Is the current dividend payment safe?"" We look at some of the most important financial factors, such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more.Dividend Safety Scores range from 0 to 100, and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least 60. Since tracking the data, companies cutting their dividends had an average Dividend Safety Score below 20 at the time of their dividend reduction announcements.We wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how Dividend Safety Scores are calculated, what their real-time track record has been, and how to use them for your portfolio, here.Seagate's Dividend Safety Score of 19 means it is one of the riskiest dividends on Wall Street. That should come as no shock to investors, since the company doesn't have that great record sustaining its payout during times of economic distress.While Seagate has nicely increased its dividend in recent years, that's been driven by its decision to raise its payout ratios, which are now approaching more dangerous levels.Then, there's the issue of the company's weakening balance sheet. While not yet dangerously overleveraged, with a current ratio still well above 1 and sufficient cash reserves to fund the dividend for the next nine quarters, Seagate's torrid pace of buybacks has largely been funded by rising debt levels.You can see that its debt-to-capital ratio has increased meaningfully over the last decade. I prefer to invest in companies with a debt-to-capital ratio no higher than 50% in most cases.While that may have worked when interest rates were at all-time lows and cheap debt capital was easily accessible, a rising interest rate environment could create a somewhat more challenging environment for the company.When we compare Seagate's balance sheet to its industry peers, we similarly see cause for concern. While the leverage ratio is relatively low, at the same time, the company's high debt/capital ratio and lower-than-average current ratio give it a credit rating that is dangerously close to junk status.(Sources: Morningstar, F.A.S.T. Graphs)Combined with the decline of its core HDD business, which could eventually become obsolete, Seagate will need to devote a larger share of its free cash flow going forward to deleveraging. You can see that the company's sales have declined year over year in each of the last eight quarters.In fact, rating firm Moody's recently warned that it has a negative outlook on the company's debt, which could soon result in a credit downgrade.A downgrade to junk bond status could be troublesome for the company, because it would mean much higher refinancing costs in the future, as well as less flexibility when it comes to acquiring SSD manufacturing ability going forward.Given that Seagate will eventually have to invest heavily in SSD to remain relevant in the coming years, the company might not be able to afford the $727 million annual dividend cost.Seagate's Dividend GrowthOur Dividend Growth Score answers the question, ""How fast is the dividend likely to grow?"" It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score, but places more weight on growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.Seagate's Dividend Growth Score is 32, which at first may surprise you given the company's strong payout growth in recent years.However, we need to remember that this is a company that appears to be in a secular decline.Seagate will likely struggle with negative top and bottom line growth in the coming years, potentially causing its already high payout ratios to climb to unsustainable levels. That could explain why the dividend has been frozen for the last six quarters.Worse still, given the company's worrisome business outlook, as well as its past history of completely eliminating its payout during the last recession, a best-case scenario for Seagate is likely one in which it can simply maintain the current dividend, with little to no long-term growth potential.Even if management continues the dividend, the company seems likely to underperform the market in the long term, especially from today's high valuations.ValuationIn the past year, Seagate has soared nearly 90%, compared to the S&P 500's total return of about 12%.As you can see, not only is the company's current P/E far higher than its industry median, but it's also nearly triple its historic norm.While the dividend yield is certainly attractive, and in fact, is higher than that of 88% of its peers, given the dangers of a future dividend cut, owning Seagate shares at these levels doesn't seem like a prudent idea to me.(Source: GuruFocus)Seagate's valuation almost seems to be completely ignoring the risk of SSDs to its core business. In fact, in its last earnings release, the company didn't even mention solid-state storage, and during the conference call, management only mentioned the term once.I would prefer if Seagate more directly addressed this potentially existential threat, one that is likely to only further erode the company's sales, profits, and cash flow in the years to come.Concluding Thoughts On Seagate TechnologiesGiven the secular headwinds to growth that Seagate is facing, even the current high yield doesn't compensate investors sufficiently for the risks that owning this company represents.With many better-quality high yield stocks available, investors really have no reason to put their hard-earned money at risk with what could very likely prove to be a long-term value trap."

It should come as no surprise, as any stock that's gone so consistently upward was bound to be extremely sensitive to even relatively minor negative news.STX Price data by YChartsThat's a prototypical overreaction to what in the grand scheme of things is relatively minor news. Today, we will examine the underlying prospects of Seagate after this event and see whether this is a genuine buying opportunity.Stability PC sales have been on the decline in recent years, and with Seagate's business heavily dependent on sales to original equipment manufacturers, it's been a drag on revenue. There are some early signs that sales may be starting to recover, which is a reason for some hope.This revenue decline has been by no means a constant drop-off. Rather, the latest PC market weakness took a bite out of revenue, and has been flat since, with analysts projecting revenues staying roughly flat. Seagate CEO Steve Luczo's own assessment of Seagate as operating in a ""stable"" environment was scorned a bit in the financial media, given the stock's selloff, but the analysts' numbers present his assessment as a fair one.Intel to the rescue? If there is one thing dragging down Seagate's sales as much as the cyclical market, it's the dramatic performance difference between Seagate's hard drives and the more expensive solid state drives (SSDs).The performance difference between Windows 10 with an SSD and a hard drive is night and day, and if things don't change, hard drives could quickly be relegated to lower-end, cheaper systems.Luckily, this is the personal computer we're talking about, and things always change. Just this past week, figures started emerging on Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) new Optane memory, showing that hard drives outfitted with it see a massive performance jump, bringing them closer to in-line with the SSDs, while still retaining the much cheaper price of a hard drive, and the much larger storage capacity.This could be a game changer in the storage market, and once again cement the hard drives, a market which Seagate is a leader within, as the go-to choice in all but very narrow niches of the computer market.And that dividend When I last wrote about Seagate in mid-2015, I emphasized the company's dividend, and specifically the ongoing growth of that dividend.The dividend is still the most important part of the story today, though with that growth having continued apace, we can't necessarily expect huge further dividend growth from the current 63 cents per quarter. We can, however, all very much enjoy a 6% dividend yield.The current dividend levels can be easily sustained too - a fact that's particularly important to determine when a selloff puts a yield into such appealing territory.Over the past nine months, Seagate has generated $1.67 billion in cash from operating activities. Remember, the $2.72 annual dividends only cost about $800 million in cash. But it's also important to note that this is a substantial year-over-year improvement to the $1.41 billion in cash generated in the first nine months of the previous year. We can likely expect another $300 million or so in such free cash generated by fiscal year's end.Conclusion I was very skeptical that the 16% price drop last week was justified by Seagate's most recent earnings, and came away from analyzing the 10-Q and other surrounding information more convinced than ever that this was a dramatic overreaction.Seagate is a very appealingly priced income stock, and this recent selloff has provided an excellent entry point, particularly for those looking for a long-term play.On top of that, Seagate has some $3 billion in cash on hand and is generating a couple of billion annually in positive cash from operations. While it's not clear that we can count on continued dividend growth at the rapid pace we've seen in recent years, the company could well sustain some additional growth and is worth buying even if the dividend stays flat."
4065629,74295,2017-04-26T14:48:03-04:00,"Seagate is down more than 16% Wednesday.The company reported third-quarter earnings that were fine but apparently not what the market was hoping for.While earnings have rebounded, I believe the dividend is still too high to be sustained.That said, the macroeconomic environment appears to be on the rise, which could keep the stock moving higher.I rate Seagate Technology a Hold on the drop.","This article is the 53rd installment in a segment called ""Buy on the Drop?,"" in which I choose a stock that recently experienced a large decrease in price and give a recommendation on whether investors should ""buy on the drop"" or not. The recommendations are Sell, Hold, Speculative Buy, Buy, and Strong Buy.Seagate Gets BrickedSeagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is down more than 16% in Wednesday trading after reporting third-quarter earnings before the market open, leaving investors wondering whether this is an opportunity to buy. Despite the fall, STX is still up 58% over the last 12 months and about 130% off 52-week lows:STX data by YChartsImproving market conditions have allowed Seagate to make a convincing recovery from sharply declining earnings and collapsing share price to prove the bears wrong. I myself was, and still am to an extent, one of those bears. I wrote two article last year saying that STX was a dividend yield trap and that they needed to cut the dividend, yet here we are in 2017 and the stock is outperforming. I still think the dividend should be cut, but we'll get to that in a bit.Let's first summarize the Q3 report to try and isolate the cause for this steep price decline. Revenue for the quarter $2.67 billion, which missed consensus estimates by $40 million and represents a 3% year-over-year (""YoY"") increase, and EPS was $1.10, which beat estimates by 3 cents and was an impressive $0.88 improvement over Q3 2016 EPS. Seagate also generated $426 million in operating cash flow, paid $186 million in dividends, and raised another $1.25 billion in debt.Nothing here really seems like it could have caused such a big drop, so perhaps guidance can answer that question. On the company's conference call, Seagate guided for Q4 2017 revenue of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, gross margin of 31%, cash flow slightly down sequentially, and EPS of $4.50 for fiscal year 2017 (implying EPS of $1.03 for Q4 2017). The midpoint of revenue guidance is about 6% below consensus estimates, and while FY2017 EPS of $4.50 is in line with estimates, Q4 EPS of $1.03 is slightly below the average estimate of $1.08.Again, none of this is particularly unexpected or awful. A 6% revenue miss that doesn't affect earnings expectations isn't much to worry about, and the slight miss in Q4 2017 EPS seems to be due to variance between analyst estimates as FY2017 EPS if expected to be in line with estimates.If it wasn't the current quarterly results and it wasn't guidance, what was the reason for a 16% drop in share price? While it's impossible to know for sure, the most likely explanation is that STX's big gains over the last few months have driven up market expectations. Just meeting estimates isn't enough when a stock is up huge and expectations for the sector as a whole are flying high.It's important to remember that just because a stock drops, that doesn't mean it is necessarily a buying opportunity. STX could have been overvalued and is now fairly valued, so don't immediately view this drop as the market acting irrationally to a good earnings report.Seagate's earnings recovery has done wonders for its valuation, and it appears that there might be yet more room to run purely from a bottom line perspective. STX is trading at about 10 times expected FY2017 earnings, a bit under 10 times FY2018 estimated earnings, and an EV/EBITDA of about 9, which is better than Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and the market as a whole.However, I still have one issue with Seagate: its dividend. Cash flow has been insufficient to cover the dividend payments for a while now, and even with the sharp recovery in earnings, Seagate cannot organically cover its dividend payments with free cash flow. It was way worse when earnings were in the gutter last year, but it was still a problem in Q3 2017, even with $1.10 in earnings per share.Last quarter, Seagate's best quarter in years, the company had plenty of free cash flow to cover the quarterly dividend, but in this quarter, free cash flow was only $96 million, well below the $186 million dividend payment. This trend has led to the need to continuously raise debt:STX Net Total Long Term Debt (Annual) data by YChartsThat criss-cross pattern at the end is the opposite of what an investor should want to see. As free cash flow has gone lower, Seagate has increased its debt position to compensate and to continue paying its loft dividend. This is unsustainable.Seagate does not have a very higher revenue ceiling in its current market in my opinion. The hard disk drive market may remain constant for a while, but it is unlikely to increase. What this means is that Seagate could have trouble covering its dividend for the foreseeable future, which will require either adding more and more debt, or cutting the dividend.Personally, I wouldn't invest in a business in this situation, but that doesn't mean that one should sell stock in STX either. There is still potential upside here based on earnings potential compared to the current valuation, and I would like the stock even more if the dividend was slashed. Therefore, I will not rate the stock a Sell. However, because of the likely unsustainability of the dividend and the rising debt needed to finance it, I also will not rate the stock a Buy. Basically, for investors who already hold STX, I don't think selling after this drop is necessary, but I also wouldn't be rushing to boost my position either. Therefore, I rate Seagate Technology a Hold on the drop.If you want to stay up-to-date on my articles, you can ""Follow"" me by clicking ""Follow"" at the top of this page or by going to my author page.

4038921,43091,2017-01-24T09:18:42-05:00,"PC refresh cycle improving after almost 5 years.
        HDD business should show slight uptick.
        NAND demand more than likely exceeding supply.","Seagate Technology, the hard drive and data storage technology company, is set to reporting earnings this afternoon after the close of regular market trading.The Street currently expects the company to report earnings of $1.08 per share on revenues of $2.83 billion for the December 2016 quarter. For the current quarter ending in March, Seagate is expected to earn $0.85 per share on revenues of $2.62 billion as per sellside consensus estimates.On the hard drive disk (HDD) side of its business, Seagate should see slight upside thanks to the reduced decline in the PC market and continued strength in its cloud business. In addition, the company's NAND business should also show strength if one looks at the results from semiconductor companies which also show that supply remains constrained relative to demand.Just last week, Seagate announced that it was shutting down a factory in China as part of its restructuring to reduce its widespread global operations and thus better align costs going forward.Shares of Seagate Technology are currently priced to move about 7% in either direction post its earnings tonight. Currently 35.3 million shares of Seagate are held short as of 12/30/2016 which accounts for almost 16% of its float which could lead to a nice squeeze higher if the results and guidance going forward are better than expected.At the moment, Seagate shares are approximately $5 per share off their 52 week high and have returned 38% in the last one year compared to the S&P 500 which has moved higher by 21.3% in the same time frame. In addition, the company has a current dividend yield of almost 7% which make it an attractive investment not just from a price expectation point of view but also due its juicy dividened of $2.52 per share (last twelve months).Back in the first week of December, Western Digital had raised its outlook for the quarter citing strength in NAND, HDD and a slightly improving PC demand environment going forward. I expect Seagate to be a beneficiary of the same issues and also benefit from improved synergies due to its global cost-cutting efforts currently underway.My fair value for Seagate Technology is right around $45 per share using an earnings multiple of 12x (a roughly 33% discount to the current S&P multiple) and factoring in the juicy dividend yield"
4052162,101850,2017-03-05T15:58:20-05:00,"Seagate will continue to face end market challenges.But management has executed well, driving strong recent earnings.Good shareholder returns as well, but questions over sustainability.Valuations seem too high relative to its peers.","As its latest earnings results have proved, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) has rectified past execution issues over the last year that should enable it to weather revenue declines in its core PC market. But without a significant pick-up in PCs and lack of a meaningful SSD offering, Seagate will continue to face challenges to its revenue, earnings and cash flow generation. In the longer term, Seagate's financial position remains tied to the fate of HDD and should, thus, continue its decline in line with the HDD TAM.Despite the bearish sentiment around the HDD space (which Seagate predominantly operates in), the company has posted an impressive rebound in operating results in part due to better market trends, but also its own aggressive cost management actions. I'd remain focused on the sustainability of the company's momentum given the historical volatility in its performance. Longer term secular challenges facing HDDs and execution risk remain, but thus far, Seagate looks to be making the best of things. Seagate could also ramp up shareholder returns over the coming quarters if cash flow remains solid (barring further strategic M&A).Valuations, however, are not attractive. Investors are currently willing to pay 9-11x PE for declining EPS as earnings may be relatively stable post 2017 for Seagate. But the confluence of weak end market demand and Seagate's high sensitivity to small changes in demand for high-capacity enterprise HDDs will pose downside risks to such valuations.Strong EarningsSeagate reported very strong 2Q results, beating consensus on both revenue and margins for the reported quarter as well as guidance. Will the strong earnings report silence the HDD bears though? Unlikely in my view. But in the meantime, they'll have plenty of food for thought.Seagate's revenue for the quarter of $2.9B beat consensus by 2%, driven by both units and average selling prices (ASPs). Strong demand for higher-capacity products in the consumer, surveillance and NAS markets was cited as a key driver. Overall, top line was positively impacted by product mix and pricing, while previously announced restructuring benefits flowed through to costs. Gross margin of 31.8% was up 6.2% YoY (+2.2% QoQ), with half the benefit coming from manufacturing footprint reduction and other half from a better optimized product portfolio.Seagate guided for 3Q revenue of ~$2.7B, 3% ahead of consensus as the company pivots towards higher capacity segments. Revenues are expected to grow in 2017 (vs. the 1% decline expected by consensus) as a result of shifting mix toward higher margin products and better cost efficiency. Assuming ""market conditions remain intact"", STX believes it can grow 2017 revenue and post adjusted EPS of at least $4.50, which compares with consensus of $3.86 prior to the call.A noteworthy comment on the results - inventory grew to a high of 46 days (vs. 40-day three-year average). For now, it would seem that the increased inventory levels are down to building a buffer due to one-offs/seasonal factors, e.g. factory consolidation and ahead of the Chinese New Year. If these levels persist in March, though, expect some alarms to be raised.Good ExecutionManagement's success in incorporating its cost rationalization plans is reflected in the strong quarter and drove favourable mix shifts in the business. Is there further room to cut going forward? Maybe - while $500M of restructuring costs have been recognized, not all the savings have come through. This should provide Seagate management a lever to maintain gross margins at the high-end of the 27-32% range near term. But I have my doubts about long-term sustainability of these margin levels. In its 2Q call, Seagate cited utilizations around 80%-100% or operations close to full capacity. While the company could very well stay at these levels for the near term, gross margins (currently ~32%) are probably maximized at this point. Opex should continue to trend down, though, as the benefits of cost cuts and restructuring haven't been fully realized.It's hard to fault Seagate much on this front considering it has rectified past execution issues and embarked on a more streamlined fixed cost structure. Either way, this will help the company weather further revenue declines in its core PC market.Things have undoubtedly been helped in recent years by the consolidation within the industry, which has resulted in a much more stable pricing dynamic.The high degree of consolidation today is notable, as we are now down to two companies that control over 85% of the industry (players outside the top two, e.g. Toshiba, are limited in their ability to expand production capabilities). Both companies tend to have incentives aligned with gross margins and pricing stability.But Capital Allocation Policy May Be UnsustainableManagement hasn't just succeeded on execution though, they've made Seagate a very investor friendly stock. Dividend and cash flow projections may become constrained should Seagate choose to pursue strategic acquisitions a la Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). This will hurt Seagate as one of the more attractive aspects of the HDD industry has been the high FCF generation. Both WDC and Seagate have consistently used the strong cash flow to return cash back to shareholders via buybacks and dividends.Historically, Seagate has been more aggressive in returning capital back to shareholders. From 2010 to 2014, it used >100% of its FCF for buybacks and dividends, with minimal focus on M&A until late 2014 when it acquired Xyratex and LSI's PCIe assets. Meanwhile, WDC has taken a more balanced approach and been committed to returning 50% of FCF to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Thus far, WDC has been more active in M&A, acquiring Virident, sTec and Skyera. It has used $5B over the last three years to acquire various SSD and HDD assets.Seagate in its latest quarter repurchased $147M worth of shares, or 4.1M shares at an average cost of $36. It has also paid $188M in dividends and reiterated long-term target range to pay out 30% to 50% of free cash flow. As the secular deterioration of the HDD business is likely to persist, at some point STX could consider paring back on payouts to use cash for strategic investments a la WDC which should constrain dividends going forward.Secular Trends Still Unfavorable… But Not As MuchStructural weakness in the end markets remains, despite solid management execution. To Seagate's credit, it has managed to pivot away from PC exposure toward more stable enterprise trends. But it's hard to get away from the fact that pricing conditions have deteriorated in the enterprise HDD market where Seagate predominantly operates (despite the growing solid state drive and storage systems portfolio).Flash adoption has also weighed on investor concern as this trend has accelerated in both PCs and enterprise storage. The fear is that negative impact to HDD TAM from a secular PC decline as well as proliferation of Flash SSDs in the high performance/mission critical market will continue. The chart below shows the narrowing ASP differential between SSD and HDDs.Could NAND be a long-term wholesale replacement for HDDs? Unlikely, but the HDD space is in decline nonetheless. Given the rather high capex requirements for NAND, the incremental capex SSD suppliers would need to add to create the amount of exabytes currently produced by the HDD industry would render the transition unfeasible. NAND capacity is inherently more expensive to add, given the technology, with NAND suppliers spending roughly one-third of sales on new capex each year, versus the HDD industry at just 5%. Estimates place the cost to add an increment petabyte (PB) of NAND versus the cost to add an increment PB of HDD capacity at roughly 24x.NAND should continue to win in applications that demand performance and small form factors at a cost. Meanwhile, HDDs should continue to hold their share in capacity applications. Furthermore, NAND ROI has been degrading over the last few years, making it unlikely for NAND companies to invest in capex aggressively.Both technologies seem more complementary rather than substitutes over the longer term, with HDDs as the preferred storage medium for capacity, while NAND and SSDs will win when speed and footprint are highly valued. The HDD market has seen significant changes over the past few years as some traditional markets have moved to embrace NAND, while new markets have emerged which value capacity at a low cost.Don't Chase ValuationsWhile I don't think the structural decline in its end markets is all doom and gloom, valuation is full with the stock trading at 22x 2016 EPS and ~10x NTM PE. Now, HDD stocks are highly correlated, historically trading in a P/E range of 4x-20x, with a median forward P/E of 10x.(Source: Keybanc)This would put Seagate's valuation at unattractive levels, especially considering the headwinds facing the stock. The peer group is currently trading at 10.1x consensus C2017 EPS (post Q2 earnings).In my view, Seagate should trade at a discount to its main competitor WDC given Seagate's inferior HDD market position, cost discipline, and growth prospects. Investors are, however, currently willing to pay 9-11x PE for declining EPS as earnings may be relatively stable post 2017 for Seagate.However, although Seagate is committed to cutting costs as it aims to lower its fixed cost base in order to maintain gross and operating margins and stabilize operating cash flow, the confluence of weak end market demand and Seagate's high sensitivity to small changes in demand for high-capacity enterprise HDDs, along with 1H17 seasonality, pose additional near-term risks.Best to wait on the sidelines for now."
4060007,63883,2017-04-04T02:46:57-04:00,,"This post was written by Bob Ciura for Sure DividendSeagate (NASDAQ:STX) is a rarity in the technology sector. Based on its recent share price, the stock offers a 5.5% dividend yield. Such a high dividend yield is usually reserved for utility stocks.Seagate has a volatile dividend history. It is not on the list of Dividend Achievers, a group of 271 stocks with 10+ years of consecutive dividend increases. You can see the full Dividend Achievers List here. But, its high yield has attracted the attention of Joel Greenblatt, Managing Principal and Co-Chief Investment Officer of Gotham Asset Management. Seagate is one of the top 20 dividend stocks in Joel Greenblatt's portfolio.Gotham owns approximately 546,000 shares of Seagate, an investment worth roughly $21 million.Seagate has a very high dividend yield, which is normally a 'red flag' that the company is in trouble.While Seagate is in a turnaround phase, it continues to generate enough cash flow to maintain its hefty dividend payout.This article will analyze Seagate and its dividend.Business OverviewSeagate provides data storage products, mainly hard disk drives, which account for 90% of the company's revenue by product line.Seagate had a difficult year in 2016. Revenue declined 19% for the year. The decline in revenue was due to three factors, which were the strong U.S. dollar, weaker economic conditions in China, and the troubles facing the personal computer segment.Seagate has a large international footprint, with the majority of its revenue coming from outside the U.S. Its revenue breakdown by geography is below:More than half Seagate's annual revenue comes from Asia, meaning the slowdown in the Chinese economy last year hit the company particularly hard. And, the steady decline in global PC shipments has caused related storage devices to decline in tandem.The smartphone boom has shown no signs of slowing down. As more computing functions are performed on smartphones, there is less demand for laptop and desktop computers. Technology industry research firm Gartner found that 2016 marked the 5th consecutive year that global PC shipments fell. For the year 2016, PC shipments declined 6.2% from 2015. PC client shipments continue to represent 24% of Seagate's HDD revenue. That said, the company still generated more than $11 billion of revenue last year.Source: 2016 Earnings Presentation, page 4In response to the industry slowdown, Seagate announced a significant restructuring. This also weighed on the company's profits last year.Diluted earnings per share fell 84%, due in part to a $175 million restructuring charge. Still, the company remained profitable, even in a difficult climate. And, on an adjusted basis, Seagate had earnings per share of $2.26. One reason for this is because, despite increased adoption of solid-state and flash, hard disk drives have retained a high level of demand. Hard disk drives continue to be the primary choice for mass storage, particularly among enterprise customers because of their high performance and cost effectiveness.Growth ProspectsThe first strategic priority for Seagate is to stabilize its core HDD business. Since HDD products represent most of its business, this is critical to Seagate's turnaround. Fortunately, there are clear signs that Seagate's recovery is gaining momentum.High-capacity HDDs continue to see strong demand. Future growth opportunities in this segment include consumer, surveillance, and DVR. Last quarter, revenue from these areas increased 19% year over year. Also, Seagate's exabyte shipment growth has accelerated in recent quarters, due to demand for higher-capacity drives.Source: Q2 FY 2017 Earnings Presentation, page 8Conditions have significantly improved to start fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings per share rose to $1.38 last quarter, up 68% year over year. Cost cuts are also having an effect: Seagate's gross margin reached 30.8% last quarter, the highest level over the past year. Operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, fell to 18% last quarter, down from 21% in the previous quarter.Source: Q2 FY 2017 Earnings Presentation, page 4This drove a very strong performance in the most recent quarter, and management is hopeful the turnaround can continue moving forward. Longer term, Seagate is making investments in new storage technologies, in particular, the cloud. The broader gravitation from the PC to the cloud continues unabated. Seagate is investing heavily in cloud storage to capitalize on the trend. For example, in 2015, Seagate acquired Dot Hill Systems for $695 million. This acquisition helps the company expand its reach in storage systems and software. Seagate's strong free cash flow allows it to invest both internally and through acquisition to more pursue its growth in new areas.Dividend AnalysisIt wasn't too long ago that hardly any tech stocks paid dividends at all. But the tech boom-and-bust of the 1990s changed that. In the aftermath of the tech bubble bursting, investors began to put pressure on tech companies to share the wealth. Since strong tech companies generate high levels of cash flow, they are well equipped to pay hefty dividends.Macroeconomic conditions worsened in 2016, but Seagate still managed to generate $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year. This more than covered its dividend, which required $727 million of cash last year. On a percentage basis, Seagate's dividend accounted for 67% of its 2016 free cash flow. A payout ratio of two-thirds of free cash flow should allow Seagate to maintain its dividend, provided business conditions do not deteriorate much further.Another promising sign for the dividend is that Seagate does not have a dangerous level of debt on the company's balance sheet. At the end of last quarter, Seagate held $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, compared with $4.1 billion of long-term debt. Seagate has a current ratio of 1.5, which means its current assets exceed its current liabilities by 50%.Final ThoughtsJoel Greenblatt owns many cheap, high-yield dividend stocks in Gotham's portfolios. This includes stocks from the technology sector, that pay solid dividends to shareholders. In that same vein, it is not surprising to see that Seagate is also included.Seagate trades for a price-to-earnings ratio of 20, which is slightly below the average stock in the S&P 500 Index. And, assuming its turnaround materializes, the company's earnings stand to grow in 2017 and beyond.With a 5.5% dividend yield that appears covered by free cash flow, Seagate is an attractive dividend stock pick, and is a rarity for the technology sector."
4036482,50682,2017-01-12T15:07:20-05:00,"Seagate's factory closure, combined with its earlier formation of a Chinese technology-sharing joint venture, reflect the changing approach away from local manufacturing that western tech firms are taking toward China.China is losing its attractiveness as a manufacturing ground for high-tech products partly due to a campaign by Beijing to build up a globally competitive domestic chip sector.What's the meaning of this factory closure and the newer joint venture, and what's the outlook for semiconductor and high-tech equipment manufacturing in China?","New reports are saying that hard disk drive maker Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) is closing down a factory in the eastern city of Suzhou as part of a restructuring plan to revive its operations. Such a development isn't huge news, since the global semiconductor sector is undergoing a major consolidation.But this particular closure also comes just months after Seagate announced a new tie-up with Chinese partner Sugon to tap the local market for IT products and services. So the bigger question becomes: What's the meaning of this factory closure and the newer joint venture, and what's the outlook for semiconductor and high-tech equipment manufacturing in China?The answer seems to be that China is losing its attractiveness as a manufacturing ground for high-tech products partly due to a massive campaign by Beijing to build up a globally competitive domestic chip sector. At the same time, selling IT products services into China is still a lucrative area for foreign makers of chips and networking equipment. But they can only do that now in partnership with Chinese firms, following Beijing's recent roll-out of a tough new national security law.We'll look more closely at the bigger picture shortly and what it might mean for big foreign tech names in China, but first let's review the basic facts surrounding Seagate. The company is saying it will cut 2,000 jobs as a result of closing its Suzhou factory, which is part of a previously announced broader global restructuring plan (English article).That plan is aimed at reducing its manufacturing footprint as Seagate and other chip and memory designers look to third-party contract manufacturers to do that capital intensive work for them. Such outsourcing of manufacturing has been going on for quite a while, so in that sense it's not surprising to see Seagate making this move.Next let's look at the bigger picture surrounding Seagate and some of its western peers in China. One of those, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), was hoping to secure big funding from China by selling 15 percent of itself to Tsinghua Unispendour last year. But that deal was ultimately nixed after coming under scrutiny by the US agency that reviews such transactions for national security concerns. Another similar deal that would have seen memory chip giant Micron (NASDAQ:MU) get bought by a Unisplendour sister company also collapsed previously for similar reasons.Seeking China Cash?It's not really clear if Seagate was ever seeking a similar cash infusion from a Chinese partner, though I certainly wouldn't be surprised if it was approached by Unigroup or other similar investors at some point. China has made no secret that it wants to build up its local chip-design and manufacturing capacity, and Unigroup and several other local names have embarked on a global buying spree to try to import the necessary expertise.But political resistance has been unexpectedly strong in the US, and signs are emerging that European governments also are reluctant to lose such companies to China. Thus even if Seagate was hoping for a cash infusion from China, which could have included assistance to revive its Suzhou plan, it probably realized it might never get such help due to resistance in Washington.Realizing their access to manufacturing assistance from China might be limited, Seagate, Western Digital and most other major western chip and IT product makers have taken a different tack in China. That has seen most form joint ventures with Chinese partners, which is now required by Beijing from western companies that want to sell to government agencies and big state-owned enterprises.Seagate and Western Digital both announced new ventures last year with the same partner, Sugon, an up-and-coming Chinese tech name. Those and other similar pairings look like end-runs around Washington since the US partners will be required to give Sugon sensitive information like product source codes and other specifications under tough requirements in Beijing's national security law.All that brings us back to the original issue of the outlook for high-tech manufacturing in China over the next few years, against the backdrop of rising costs, a slowing economy and the global semiconductor retrenchment. The Seagate example would seem to show that China-based manufacturing is becoming less attractive. In its place, technology-sharing tie-ups with local partners could be the new preferred form of investment going forward.Disclosure: None."

I am concerned about the potential compression of dividend stocks as interest rates climb. At the same time, I cannot recommend sitting on the sidelines since the market could keep grinding upwards for years to come - albeit at a slower pace.So what is an investor supposed to do when the market is offering a large plate of blah?My recommended play for 2017 is to either sell cash-secured put options or deep in-the-money covered call options. These have the same basic effect on your account. First, I will talk about the basic process of this trade and then I will focus on performing this trade with Seagate (NASDAQ:STX).Covered Calls vs. In-The-Money Put SellingA covered call is where you own the underlying (shares) but sell rights on them.Selling a cash-secured put means you put cash in your account and make an agreement to buy shares should they fall to a certain price.In theory, both methods should be equal (but may not be due to put/call skew). Which one you use may depend on which type of transaction your account allows.Covered Call on SeagateAbout a month ago, I wrote this article on Seagate where I came to the conclusion that this stock was neither a buy nor a sell. I think that Seagate will continue to struggle to find its way as price per megabyte competitiveness continues.But this lukewarm long-term investment, which offers a strong dividend, makes a perfect candidate for our covered call income generation machine. This is the process.What does this all mean? Let's walk through it.The forward annual dividend rate is $2.52 per share. If we use your ""net share cost"" as the strike price (because the value of the share price above the $30 strike was returned to you - as in $8.45 per share), then your anticipated dividend yield is 8.4%.Your options income yield, based on $1.70 premium and a strike of $30, is 5.6%.This gives you a total income yield of 14% in one year's time.What is the risk that you will not get this?If the dividend is cut, this will lower your income yield. So you should do your own due diligence into that possibility.As well, if share prices were to fall to $26.78 and the option was exercised in January 2018, you would break even. This represents a 30% share price drop from current levels. Any further drop below this level would result in net losses.Another scenario is that the option could be exercised early. As long as prices were above $30 per share at the time of it being exercised, you would keep all the options premium (5.6%) and any dividends collected up until then. While your total return on the trade might be less, your annual return would go up (e.g. you make 10% in six months for a 20% annual return). And you could always write another covered call on the same stock.Put WritingPut writing has a similar profile. You can write a cash-secured put option with an expiration of January 2018 at a strike of $30. This means you are obligated to pay $30 per share if the option is exercised. You receive $3.20-3.25 per share, which results in a premium yield of 10.5-11%. You reduce your risk of an income drop in case dividends are reduced or frozen. The rest of the risks are fairly similar.SummaryFor stocks which I have a strong bullish bias on, I buy shares or call options. For stocks which I have a strong bearish bias on, I short-sell or buy put options. If I have neither a strong up nor down bias and the options premium is good, I recommend using in-the-money covered calls or selling cash-secured put options.Seagate is a good candidate for this type of trade right now."
4023576,25047,2016-11-15T11:56:20-05:00,"The SSD threat to HDDs has long been known.However, right now I believe the pieces are in place to produce a tipping point.As such, I expect consumer HDD demand to accelerate its drop, and for the higher-margin Enterprise business to also suffer.","It's long been known that SSDs (Solid State Drives) would provide a massive challenge to HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). I needn't remind that ultimately SSDs are much faster, more reliable, less power hungry and lighter. The benefits to computing, especially mobile computing, are entirely obvious.For the longest of times, SSDs faced but one problem. They were a lot more expensive. As a result, they were only available in lower storage sizes, and these prices and lower storage sizes showed up as being a significant negative for many increasingly storage-hungry applications, such as video. Video, of course, was (and still is) enjoying a massive explosion in usage (at ever-higher resolutions, too).As time went by, SSDs steadily saw their costs head lower, them being aided by Moore's law when it came to semiconductor manufacturing. Again, this isn't new. What is new, is that I believe the market might now be at a tipping point. Prices and capacities have reached a level where, I believe, suddenly desktop/laptop HDDs are going to see an extreme decline.This decline will be aided not just by the SSDs becoming larger and cheaper, but also because video (and photo storage) has for a large part shifted towards the cloud. Now, this cloud doesn't store content on vapor, it also needs HDDs -- but the cost per bit at the cloud level will be lower than the cost per bit at the consumer level. Plus, of course, having a video in 1000 consumer devices consumes a lot more bits than having the video in 1 central location. Anyway, video started being heavily consumed in streaming form, and photos have gained from such freemium services as Google Photos, reducing the need for local storage.The end result is SSD capacities continuing heading towards the ""critical"" 500GB-1TB levels, while local storage needs have, for the most part, stagnated at those same levels as well (for a mainstream consumer). And as these two meet at a decent price level, the tipping point happens: suddenly, consumers will no longer even consider buying a device which carries an HDD instead of an SSD.Consider prices for components. A 500GB SSD today can easily be found for less than $110. A 500GB HDD is much cheaper, at $40. The price differential is now just $70 between the two. What can seem as a tremendous relative price differential (the SSD is 175% more expensive) has narrowed into a small absolute differential. $70 is low enough that the obviously superior SSD technology will overwhelmingly be chosen, given the speed differential. This is so because an HDD-equipped laptop will behave as a much lower-end device than the same laptop using an SSD. Thus, a 15% or so price differential between the two laptops will appear as minimal versus the performance boost.The Tipping Point Is Already Becoming EvidentTake Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). Seagate reports its segments as being:The tipping point I am talking about affects mostly ""Client Compute"". The year-on-year performance for this segment is already showing steep contraction, with volume drops of around 30%. These are the drops I actually expect to accelerate.Moreover, Seagate has shifted some of this segment into the Client Non-Compute by moving gaming consoles there (Xbox One, PS4). Alas, one could argue that these consoles are just 1 generation away from quitting HDDs as well, especially if Nintendo's Switch gains any market traction. The Switch is based on a mobile device which works as a hybrid console (fixed, on-the-go). Obviously, it doesn't use an HDD.Regarding DVRs, it might take longer since cost is a powerful argument and customers might be more amenable to poor performance.It should be said that Enterprise HDDs were 41% of revenue in the latest quarter, versus 24% for PC Client revenues. Thus, while in terms of volume Client Compute represented 41%, it's clear that Enterprise ASPs still bridge a lot of that gap. But this brings us to another problem.Another Problem - EnterpriseThe other problem relates to the Enterprise segment. This segment could broadly be divided into high performance HDDs and high capacity HDDs. Here's how Seagate defines Enterprise Performance HDDs:Now, these are certainly some of the higher ASP, higher margin, Enterprise products. The problem, of course, is obvious. This is the precise segment which gets eaten by SSDs the quickest. SSDs are superior in performance, and HDDs sacrifice capacity for performance. HDDs in such a segment are bound to lose market share particularly quickly.The other broad segment, focusing on higher capacity, is the one where HDDs will lose the slowest -- indeed, it's the one segment that's helping show stability, as it gains from the mobile->cloud content move as previously described. However over time 3D NAND improvements and Intel's XPoint are sure to also bring grief there.Yet Another Problem - SSDs Are A Different MarketIt might be that some will put forward the argument that Seagate will be able to sell SSDs as well. Indeed, Seagate already does and has an entire Enterprise segment dedicated to it:This, in my view, is a fallacy. It doesn't matter if Seagate will also sell SSDs. The problem here is that HDDs are currently an oligopoly served by a handful of competitors. These competitors control the underlying disk drive technology and don't share it with other potential entrants.The SSD market, however, is entirely different. The essential building blocks, be they NAND flash memory or controllers, are accessible to every entrant who wants to buy them and build SSDs with them. If there's an oligopoly, this oligopoly would be at the level of the NAND suppliers including Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Samsung, SanDisk, Hynix and Toshiba.At the SSD level, there's a gazillion competitors, none of which has any cost advantage. Seagate is only one more such competitor. The underlying economics for the SSD business are thus intrinsically horrendous at this point in time, and likely to remain so. Thus, for Seagate, substituting HDD sales for SSD sales, while it can keep the revenue line going, is also sure to lead to a negative margin impact over time.Risk DisclosureJust in case you think I'm fanning undue fears with this article, let me say that the company is also aware of the thesis I explained here. Indeed, within its 10-K risk disclosures you can find the following two paragraphs (emphasis is mine):Also relevantly, Seagate already acts as if obsolescence is a near-certainty. Consider the following passage from the Q3 2016 earnings call (emphasis is mine):What does this mean? It means Seagate thinks whatever demand can come from that particular segment (low-end PC clients), this demand will evaporate before the manufacturing capacity investments to meet it can be recovered. That's the gist of this article: large swaths of the storage market are reaching a tipping point, and demand from those areas will collapse close to zero within just a few short years.A Positive EffectNot to sound all negative, there's something which one might not consider, but which can work in Seagate's favor. HDDs have limited lives, something made painfully obvious in my past article titled ""A Reason To Favor Western Digital Over Seagate"".This creates the need to frequently replace HDDs. Replacement demand can in turn greatly reduce the impact from lower HDD demand on overall sales. This is something which applies essentially to Enterprise customers, since PC buyers will be more likely to either substitute their PCs over time, or to replace the HDDs with SSDs if the HDDs fail.A Positive AngleI absolutely expect SSDs to destroy HDDs over time, and the tipping point is now. However, I must add that Seagate is being very well managed. It's adjusting its production capacity for this event and minimizing capex. Seagate is doing this in a way which more or less guarantees it will produce large amounts of free cash flow over time, even as business inexorably shrinks.However, at this point investing in Seagate, even taking into account this positive angle, seems a bit like investing in paging companies when mobile phones and SMSs were taking over the world. At that time, paging companies also threw off massive amounts of cash, but the sheer obsolescence made sure those weren't desirable investments.ConclusionIt's my opinion that the shift from HDDs to SSDs is set to accelerate meaningfully in the quarters and years ahead. In my view, we've reached the tipping point in terms of SSD price/capacity where it no longer makes sense for most consumers to buy a device carrying an HDD.The shift in the Enterprise market and in parts of the Non-Compute market might be slower. However, within the Enterprise market one would say performance applications will also shift rapidly within just 1-2 years.Overall, Seagate seems to be on a track towards obsolescence, and its revenue declines (ex-SSD) are set to accelerate. SSD sales cannot effectively substitute for HDD sales, simply because SSD sales will be lower margin for Seagate. SSD sales might however muddle the revenue decline picture, which might convince investors that STX is a worthy investment in light of its high cash generation (coming from the declining HDD business).I believe the same effects described here broadly apply to Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). However, Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk (which is an actual NAND producer and IP holder) and the recent NAND price rally muddle things, hence me focusing on Seagate."
4005724,101452,2016-09-12T17:07:20-04:00,"Seagate's top line performance has struggled as demand for hard disk drives (or HDDs), their principal product, has fallen off in the face of obsolescence from more efficient technologies.The costs of expanding into the cloud storage business, including acquisition activity, coupled with falling revenues has burned through a significant amount of Seagate's cash balance.Barring a significant reversal in the company's lackluster financial performance, the math doesn't seem to add up for the sustenance of their dividend.","Seagate Technology, ticker (NASDAQ:STX), has gotten a fair amount of coverage lately, particularly in regards to the large current dividend yield, and whether or not these shareholder distributions were sustainable moving forward. Thus far, there seem to be two camps - one that believes the dividend is sustainable, and one that believes the company should cut or suspend the dividend. I decided to take a little deeper look myself at the numbers, and have come to a different conclusion. Seagate will have to cut or suspend the dividend it is currently distributing. But first, let's cover some basics on the company.Seagate designs, produces, and distributes electronic data storage technology and solutions throughout the world. From the most recent 10-K, Seagate markets itself as ""a leading provider of electronic data storage technology and solutions. Our principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, we produce a broad range of electronic data storage products including solid state hybrid drives (""SSHD""), solid state drives (""SSD""), PCIe cards and SATA controllers. Our storage technology portfolio also includes storage subsystems, and high performance computing (""HPC"") solutions. Our Cloud Systems and Solutions builds on the Seagate legacy to extend innovation from the device into the information infrastructure, onsite and in the cloud.""As alluded to in the summary bullets above, Seagate has struggled to grow or even sustain revenues the past few years, as the company's product mix, which is still heavily (>90%) dependent on HDDs, has left it vulnerable to competing technologies, in particular solid state drives, or SSDs. Although Seagate is actively attempting to diversify its product mix away from HDDs, having already been successful in developing an industry-leading 2 terabyte NVMe enterprise SSD product and continually developing cloud storage solutions, the failure to thus far materially change the product mix as mentioned has resulted in a disappointing top line trend:As explained in the 10-K (emphasis mine), ""We believe the HDD industry experienced benign price erosion in fiscal year 2014, whereas price erosion increased in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ... Revenue in fiscal year 2016 decreased approximately 19% or $2.6 billion, from fiscal year 2015, as a result of a decrease in shipments by 43 million units and price erosion, which were due to lower demand in the client compute market and reduced demand for mission critical HDD enterprise products.""While Seagate has implemented aggressive cost-cutting measures in response, they thus far have not been enough to keep up, and margin performance has been ugly across the board:    Nevertheless, the company has thus far maintained its dividend payouts, with shares now yielding around 7%:This has thus become a significant point of conversation concerning Seagate shares. Can the company possibly maintain these payouts as it continues to try and invest in newer technologies such as SSDs and cloud storage in order to diversify its product mix away from obsolete HDDs?One bright spot for the ""yes"" camp seems to be the large coverage of the dividend by cash flows. First of all, by the traditional measure, Seagate's ability to generate cash flow has been faltering along with the rest of its financials:However, it is true that cash available to equity holders has been more than sufficient to cover past dividend distributions:This is only part of the story, however, as Seagate has also been consistently repurchasing shares, which is simply another way to return cash to shareholders. On an absolute dollar basis, the repurchases have generally been multiples of the dividend distributions, and thus Seagate hasn't always been able to cover both with cash available to equity holders:Furthermore, the coverage ratio in fiscal 2016 was aided by a major cash burn, which subsequently resulted in a material reduction in working capital: As the company explained in the 10-K (emphasis mine), ""Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased from July 3, 2015 as a result of net cash outflows for the acquisition of Dot Hill of $674 million, repurchase of our ordinary shares of $1.1 billion, dividends paid to our shareholders of $727 million, and capital expenditures of $587 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by our net cash provided by operating activities."" The following table summarizes results from the statement of cash flows for the periods indicated. Note the operating cash flow:Cash provided from operating activities was very lackluster in fiscal 2016. In this regard the company goes on to explain (emphasis mine), ""Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2016 was approximately $1.7 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and a decrease in revenue accelerating a reduction in the cash conversion cycle, leading to a decrease in working capital.""And there we have it. Obviously, these material reductions in working capital are not sustainable. As I mentioned before, an easy remedy to this is of course a sharp turn-around in the revenue trend, however that probably isn't something one should naively bet on happening anytime soon, as the company's product mix is still heavily weighted towards an obsolete technology and they themselves even admit in the risk section of the 10-K that the development cycle of cloud technologies can be very long and unpredictable. So, let's say that a magnificent turn-around in revenues is unlikely and look at what other options the company has and how these affect the outlook for shareholder distributions.One option would be to effectively repeat fiscal 2016. However, even if the company hits its non-GAAP earnings guidance of $2.50/share in fiscal 2017, if it wants to continue a similar level of spending on acquisitions and R&D (very important as they are in dire need, as I've been pounding the table, of materially shifting their product mix away from a dead technology), the additional cash burn this would likely induce could have severe consequences. First off, however, in this scenario the company would again more that cover both direct and indirect distributions to shareholders: But again, this would not come without consequences. First off, the company's liquidity position would implode due to the further reduction in working capital:Additionally, Seagate has covenants to worry about on their revolving credit facility, one of the terms of which is minimum cash holdings. From the 10-K (emphasis mine), ""The credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility, as amended, contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement, as amended. The agreement includes three financial covenants: (1) minimum cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio; and (3) a net leverage ratio."" Burning more cash is thus an unsustainable option for Seagate.Another option would be to borrow additional funds as a source of cash to maintain the distributions to shareholders. This again has some issues, though. Seagate's debt to equity ratio has already ballooned after the dismal performance in fiscal 2016:Would Seagate even be able to find lenders now at decent rates? Furthermore, given that the company does not have any principal payments on current debt planned for fiscal 2017, and also assuming in this scenario that they would borrow just enough to keep working capital constant and continue investment in product diversification, net leverage would remain at the current elevated levels:As mentioned at the end of the note regarding covenant agreements in the 10-K, Seagate already had to amend the agreement earlier this year due to the trend in this ratio (emphasis mine): ""The credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility, as amended, contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement, as amended. The agreement includes three financial covenants: (1) minimum cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio; and (3) a net leverage ratio. On April 28, 2016, the Revolving Credit Agreement was amended in order to increase the allowable net leverage ratio to adjust for our current financial liquidity position. We were in compliance with the modified covenants as of July 1, 2016 and expect to be in compliance for the next 12 months."" How long would Seagate's revolving creditor put up with these levels of leverage?Another option for Seagate would of course be to simply cull spending on acquisitions, R&D, and the other expenditures meant to keep the company's technology competitive and diversify the product mix. I think we can all agree this would be the end of the company, as HDDs clearly aren't the technology of the future. At that point, the company would basically just be slowly liquidating itself.So what can Seagate do? From the above scenarios, let's assume that the company won't/can't be borrowing additional funds, it realizes it can't sustain the cash/working capital burn, and that it must continue to invest/acquire its way to a more diversified product mix. Under this scenario, even holding the current dividend and repurchases constant from fiscal 2016, the resulting coverage ratios are: Remember that share buybacks are just an indirect way to return cash to shareholders, so the second chart is the important one, and the culmination of this article. In order to preserve the integrity of its business, Seagate will have to reduce the total amount of cash it is distributing to shareholders."
4011470,22148,2016-10-11T11:50:34-04:00,Seagate Tech has rebounded sharply off the May lows in only a few months.The previous internal signal that the stock was cheap no longer exists.The high dividend yield isn't enough to overcome the lack of support going forward.,"Only a few months ago, Seagate Tech (NASDAQ:STX) was trading down at $18.40. The high dividend paying tech stock was making an aggressive capital return strategy that originally signaled buying the stock on dips.After reporting some rebounding quarterly results, the stock has flown higher by over 100% to nearly $38.00. The question now is whether the same signal occurs to abandon the stock.First and foremost, Seagate consistently pays a rather high dividend for a tech stock. At the current price, the $2.52 annual dividend yields 6.7%. The yield actually approached 14% at the lows back in May.The key signal for the stock were the buyback portion of the capital return plan. The company aggressively bought shares on the dips until Seagate got low on cash balances. Most notably, the storage company spent nearly $1 billion on buybacks last FQ1 (Sept. quarter) alone.The big hiccup is that the stock price during the large buybacks was only roughly equivalent to the current price. Seagate has only spent around $100 million on buybacks in the 3 quarters since the big buyback.By the December quarter, cash balances fell to $1.2 billion after the large buyback and disappointing results. With long-term debt at $4.1 billion, Seagate basically over spent on stock buybacks too soon leaving limited cash balances to make purchases at the lows.Now Seagate expects better results with a FY17 forecast of earning $2.50 per share. Analysts are targeting the company hitting EPS targets over $3.00 per share.The key investor takeaway is that the stock is only reasonably valued at the current price. Seagate lacks the financial flexibility to make more buybacks if the stock is cheap. Even worse, the dividend payout will suck up most of the available cash flow with the improved results expected this fiscal year.Investors can bet on the business rebounding further in FY18 and beyond warranting higher stock prices, but the company is no longer able to signal the stock remains cheap."
4020896,23881,2016-11-08T02:29:30-05:00,Demand for hard drives overall is falling.Demand for nearline drives is increasing.The increase in nearline does not offset overall decline.,"Should you buy Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) now? If you give Seagate's financials a precursory glance, the first impression would be no, then a tentative yes, and finally, a ""probably not"".The Case Against SeagateThe trailing 12 months' sales growth of the Data Storage Devices industry group has been in a gentle decline over the past 10 years, with negative growth accelerating this past year. Although Seagate has enjoyed a couple of relatively bright spots of high sales growth over the past decade, its recent decline is deeper than that of the industry group.The chart below shows the trailing 12-month revenue growth of Seagate (blue line) and the Industry Group (green).Is Seagate and its business model about to go the way of the 8-track tape? Don't write them off just yet.The Case For SeagateTechnology is ever changing. Companies adapt or die. Blockbuster comes to mind as a company which didn't adapt while Yellow Pages changed from a paper to an online business directory.Instead of blaming the consumers' ever-changing demands and wishing for things to be as they were, is Seagate adapting and changing its business model? Yes, and here is how.The bulk of the revenue, by far, comes from the company's HDD segment. This first chart shows the falling demand.But there is a small but rapidly growing segment that cannot be readily seen. This is the nearline portion of the HDD sales.The information-hungry world continues to create strong demand for ""Big Data"". While speed and performance might be the deciding factors as to what type of storage you put into your laptop, cost is the big factor when it comes to maintaining massive data servers. The push for capacity-optimized storage with a focus on cost has led to a surprising jump in nearline drives. What is nearline?Storage guru Tony Pearson is attributed with the following easy-to-understand explanation:Is it reasonable to expect that nearline drives will propel Seagate back into overall growth? First glance, yes. Second look, maybe not.The Case For IndecisionIf you are looking at the data shipped in megabytes, gigabytes or exabytes, then yes, it looks like massive growth. But shouldn't we expect strong growth in data shipped even if we sell the same amount of units? I remember not too long ago when a one-gigabyte HDD seemed massive. My recently purchased laptop, which is mid-level at best, has 1,000 times that storage capacity. But I did not spend 1,000x more on my hard drive than before. In fact, the drive is far cheaper now. That makes this statistic a bit deceiving.Let's look at units shipped for nearline drives.And next, we want to consider total drives.Remember the business model for nearline drives - more storage at a cheaper cost. Seagate may increase its market share of nearline drives by continuing to find ways to offer even larger drives that consume less power for a cheaper price. And while the company may survive the technological shift by adapting, I don't see nearline as the product that will ultimately turn declining revenues around. Slowing down negative growth and eventually stabilizing it, yes. But booming company-wide revenue growth? I am doubtful.Final Verdict - Don't Sell If You Own, But Otherwise PassWhere does this leave me with Seagate as an investment?On the plus side, earnings estimates for the current quarter, current year, and next year have been revised upwards.On the downside, I don't see any major driver for revenue growth.The dividend yield is at a nice 7.72% and the expected payout ratio is around 68%, leaving breathing room. Short term, the dividend is attractive. But against the long-term backdrop of soft revenue and recent share price volatility - I am not so sure.I find myself agreeing with the overall analyst view that this one is a Hold. If you have it, keep it. If you don't own it, pass until you can see a clear-cut case for a major increase in revenue."
3988172,48431,2016-07-13T11:51:55-04:00,"Seagate's stock shot up over 21% on the strength of its earnings pre-announcement.Seagate derives over 90% of its revenue from hard disk drives (HDDs), and this business is in secular decline.Investors should be cautious about Seagate.","Seagate's (NASDAQ:STX) earnings pre-announcement on July 11 got investors excited and sent the stock up over 21% the following day. This was probably a case of investors not looking very closely at the announcement. Seagate announced a 9.5% y/y decline in revenue for the quarter ending July 1, and other key metrics such as gross margin and HDD unit shipments declined as well. Seagate's results only reflect the fortunes of the HDD industry as a whole.Source: InfoWorldDeclining MarketSeagate expects revenue of $2.65 billion for its fiscal 2016 Q4 and gross margin of 25%. This beat guidance, and apparently the expectations of many investors, but it still reflected a decline from the year-ago quarter. In fiscal 2015 Q4 revenue was $2.927 billion and gross margin was 26.5%.Seagate also announced an additional 6500 job cuts on top of the 1600 announced a few weeks ago.Seagate has invested in solid state drives, buying Sandforce from Avago shortly after its purchase of LSI in 2014. Seagate now offers a credible line of enterprise class solid state storage devices, including Nytro branded devices that came with the Sandforce purchase.Nevertheless, Seagate is still heavily dependent on HDDs. The company reported HDD unit shipments for the quarter of 37 million with an average selling price of $67. That works out to revenue from hard drives of $2.479 billion or 93.5% of total revenue for the quarter.This represented a 19% y/y decline in unit shipments, although ASP was up 6% from last year.Disruption in ActionSeagate is a classic example of a technology company disrupted by superior technology. Solid state NAND flash storage systems completely dominate non-volatile storage for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Flash storage is also becoming de rigueur for ultra light notebooks. Flash storage is generally faster than HDD for read and write operations, but is more expensive than HDDs on a cost/GB basis.The growth of mobile devices, combined with the steady decline in traditional PC sales has produced a steady unit decline in HDD sales. The industry has consolidated, so that there are only three manufacturers of hard drives left: Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Seagate and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY). In calendar 2016 Q1, the three manufacturers shipped a total of 98 million HDDs, a 20% y/y decline, according to Anandtech. The chart (from Anandtech) below shows HDD shipments since Q3 2010:Meanwhile, shipments of solid state drives (SSDs) are trending upward, as this chart from Anandtech shows:In an interview with Anandtech on July 6, Seagate CTO Mark Re tried to make the case for hard drives on the basis of higher capacity as well as lower capacity normalized cost. It's an interesting article if you want to learn more about some of the emerging disk drive technologies. But I came away from the article with the feeling that capacity in disk drives was only going to improve incrementally over the next few years.Current state of the art in disk drives is characterized by how many bits can be recorded per square inch, about 1 Tb/in^2. Various technologies may increase that by a factor of 10 in the next 10 years.But flash storage is undergoing more than incremental improvement with the advent of 3D NAND. A recent article in InformationWeek called 3D NAND the ""hard disk killer."" 3D NAND increases greatly the data capacity per chip by creating as many as 48 separate stacked layers of transistor circuits.Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) has been a pioneer in 3D NAND, and last August announced a massive 16 TB SSD drive based on it. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has also started making 3D NAND chips and introduced its first 3D NAND-based solid state drive on March 31, 2016. Intel is still considered to be behind Samsung in 3D NAND.Price, not capacity, is becoming the main differentiator between SSD and HDD, but even that can be expected to fall away in time. A recent article in PC World had a very informative chart comparing the price for a 128 GB SSD to a 500 GB HDD:Clearly, SSDs have not closed the capacity normalized price gap. Considering their higher performance and suitability for mobile applications, do they really need to?Investor TakeawayEven though Seagate clearly understands the importance of SSDs, I'm not convinced that it can be competitive against the major players in SSDs such as Samsung and Sandisk. And Sandisk was recently acquired by Western Digital, which would seem to put Western Digital in the stronger position than Seagate. Toshiba is famous for having invented NAND technology back in 1991, so Toshiba can probably navigate the disruption of the HDD market.That leaves Seagate in the weakest position among the big three HDD makers. Seagate's very high dependence on HDD revenue, combined with secular decline in the market, says that its revenue has a very long way to fall. I recommend investors be very cautious about Seagate and rate it a sell.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3987917,25265,2016-07-12T14:40:02-04:00,"After widely missing its own estimates for several quarters, Seagate finally was able to beat expectations and generate sequential improvement in revenues and gross margin.If you assume stable revenues and a return to the previous level of gross margin going forward, the dividend does appear to be safe for the time being.However, reality might play out much differently, as the headwinds facing HDDs have not abated. Proceed with caution.","Things were not as bad as forecasted at Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) in its fiscal Q4 that ended June 30. After multiple quarters of widely missing its own sales estimates, the company lowballed Q4 guidance, estimating revenues would be just $2.3B for the quarter. At that time, analyst expectations were for $2.612B. Last night Seagate pre-announced much stronger-than-expected results. Revenues were $2.65B (down 9.5% YoY) and gross margin should come in around 25.8% (versus previous guidance of 23%). Those are sequential increases versus Q3. No doubt the stock rallies hard on this news, but let's take a look at what this might mean for the company going forward.The sequential improvements in revenues and gross margin are certainly welcome news for the Seagate bulls. The sell-side notes I have seen so far today point to higher margin, higher capacity nearline and other enterprise HDDs as driving the beat. They also expect that Seagate gained market share in enterprise during the quarter from its competitor, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). All this led to a sequential improvement in the gross margin, though it still sits below the long-term target range of 27-32%.Source: Seagate quarterly supplementalThe company made up for the lower number of units sold by dramatically increasing the average capacity per drive. It climbed to a record 1.7 terabytes in Q4.Source: same as aboveThe average capacity per drive multiplied by the number of units sold gets us to total Exabytes shipped during the quarter, which was also another record.However, it was not all good news for Seagate in Q2. Unit shipments declined again, down to 37M during the quarter.This mostly reflects the decline in the PC market, and Seagate's decision to not participate in some parts of the low-end laptop market.It is difficult to draw any conclusions from just one quarter of data. Has the trend stabilized for HDDs? JPMorgan's analyst believes a short-term inventory-driven rebound drove the Q4 beat and not an uptick in end-user demand.Source: BloombergCowen & Company's analyst is skeptical that the jump in ASP is sustainable.We will have to see. Personally I am skeptical of the company ever returning to sustained growth. I think a -5% to -10% glide path on revenues should be assumed for the foreseeable future.Expense CutsAs part of Seagate's pre-announcement, the company gave an update on its efforts to reduce costs in the wake of significantly reduced demand for its products. The company now plans to reduce its global headcount by 6,500 people or 14% of its total headcount. Seagate plans to take a $164M charge for the restructuring in FY2017. These were, of course, necessary as revenues fell massively over the course of the last 15 months. Build capacity will shrink to 35-40 million units from 55-60 million. The goal is to return the non-GAAP gross margin to a range of 27-32%.The Dividend - Is it Safe?I think it is important to estimate what Seagate can reasonably be expected to earn and turn into free cash flow to determine whether or not the dividend is safe at this point.Here are Seagate's summarized results for FY2013-FY2015. During this time, revenues, gross margin and free cash flow were fairly stable.Source: Bloomberg (10-K/10-Q summarized data)I will use the midpoint of the gross margin and free cash flow margin to project what Seagate can reasonably expect to generate in cash on its new, lower revenue base, assuming a stable margin profile. After completing this exercise, I arrived at a gross margin of 27.7% and a free cash flow margin (adjusted for Seagate's new maintenance cap. ex. plan for 2017 of $400M) of 16.9%. Cutting capital expenditures to the minimum needed to just run the business is likely not a good idea for the long-term health of the company. But clearly, Seagate is more focused right now on generating enough cash flow to maintain its dividend rather than investing in new technologies.Current consensus estimates for FY2017 revenues are $10.3B, but I expect that to go up. Let's assume for the sake of argument the company maintains FY2016 revenue next year at $11.1B. Applying the same FCF margin on this level of revenues leads to $1.89B in FCF in FY2017. The dividend costs $750M annually, so clearly in this scenario the dividend is safe. However, there will be restructuring charges that will reduce FCF by at least $100M in FY2017. And I really do not think the base case for investors should be stable revenues. I would look for a 5-10% decline throughout the course of the year. After all revenues were down 18.8% in FY2016 and the headwinds of lower PC sales and increased flash penetration have not abated. Even still, in a down 5% scenario (FCF of $1.8B) or a down 10% for revenues (FCF of $1.7B), assuming the company can return to a gross margin of 27.7%, the dividend still appears to be safe. If you knock 200bps off the gross margin the picture is not as rosy (~$1.5B), but the company can still maintain the dividend.So there you have it. If the company can achieve this level of performance in FY2017 the dividend is safe. In reality, I think it will be more difficult for Seagate to generate this level of cash, considering it likely won't return to a 27% gross margin until at least the December quarter and it has restructurings to work through. I find it curious that we did not get an update on Q4 cash flow with this pre-announcement. If it had been noteworthy, I suspect the company would have told investors, as it had in the past. I also do not believe the market will stabilize. If unit shipments continue to decline at this rate, Seagate will not operate efficiently enough to hit its gross margin targets. I expect to see more restructurings from Seagate in the coming years as unit shipments continue to fall. Note that enterprise unit shipments are only 7-9M units per quarter versus total shipments of 37M in the June quarter. Client shipments will likely continue to decline rapidly, leading to additional under-utilization of plants and equipment. Also not to be ignored is the massive decline in capital expenditures. In FY2016 the company was expected to spend about $535M in capex, down 28% from the prior year. In FY2017 the company is aiming for another 25% reduction to $400M. These cuts in excess of revenue declines point to a possible reduction in R&D going forward. Clearly, Seagate needs to invest more outside of HDDs if it wants to be in business in 10 years.If you are in the stock for the dividend, it appears the company can afford to maintain it for at least the next couple of quarters. Whether it should pay such a high dividend instead of reducing debt or investing in new technologies is open for debate. Good luck to all."
3995783,69695,2016-08-04T13:28:19-04:00,"Seagate Technology has been a battleground stock this year. Bearish analysts have repeatedly called for a dividend cut, but that has not happened yet.I have argued for some time that Seagate's sky-high dividend is likely to survive, given the company's cost cuts, capital discipline, and strong cash flow generation.With fiscal 2016 in the books, I'm now even more optimistic that the dividend will survive.","It is often true that sky-high dividend yields are a major red flag. In many cases, a stock that has a dividend yield of 8%-10% or higher is due to a massive decline in the stock price, rather than because of dividend growth. Investors tend to sell stocks when the underlying fundamentals deteriorate, because that is often a precursor to a dividend cut.However, this isn't always the case. There are certain situations in which a stock gets pummeled because its revenue and GAAP earnings are declining, but the company continues to generate enough free cash flow to sustain its payout. I believe this is the case when it comes to Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), which saw its stock price plunge over the past year before recovering in recent weeks.I last wrote about Seagate when its dividend yielded 10%, which caused most others to anticipate an imminent cut. In my last Seagate article, published on Apr. 25, I felt that the dividend would not be cut, given the company's cost cuts, cash on hand, and free cash flow.I added to my position in early May at $20 per share, and that purchase is up 50% since then. My overall position is now in the green, despite my first two purchases admittedly being early. Seagate has not cut the dividend yet, and with its fiscal 2016 in the books, I'm still of the view that the dividend is likely to remain intact.FY 2016 In ReviewHeading into this fiscal year, Seagate was getting hit by multiple headwinds. The strong U.S. dollar was eroding Seagate's revenue, since it has a significant international operation. The bigger issue is the decline in the personal computer industry, which caused deterioration in PC-related accessories such as storage devices. Adding in the fact that the technology landscape is shifting rapidly, which threatens Seagate's main HDD business, and it is no surprise why Seagate had fallen on such hard times.But as is often the case, the fears did not match the reality. Now that the results are in for fiscal 2016, the results don't seem to be as bad as the panic suggested. Seagate generated $11.1 billion of revenue for the year. That was down 19% from the prior fiscal year, which is definitely a poor performance. Whether that was deserving of the 64% peak-to-trough decline in Seagate's stock price last year however, was the basis for my last article.While Seagate's results last year were ugly based on a year-over-year review, it is important to note that there are signs of a bottom. Seagate's gross margin, which sunk to 20% in the third quarter, rose back to 25% last quarter. Also, revenue increased 2.3% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.The current quarter is expected to see continued recovery: Seagate expects to generate $2.7 billion of revenue in the current quarter, along with a 27% gross margin. These figures would represent another quarter-over-quarter improvement.What has kept me in Seagate during this volatile period is that I believe it is a compelling cash flow story. This matters because the dividend is paid from the free cash flow generated by the underlying business. There is no doubt that last year was a difficult one, but Seagate still generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the fiscal year. This was more than enough to cover the dividend, which requires approximately $727 million each year. The reason why Seagate can continue to pay such a high dividend yield even though revenue and earnings are declining is because the business is a significant cash flow generator. And, Seagate has additional financial flexibility because it has significantly cut costs. Capital expenditures were reduced 21% last year, and the company suspended its share buybacks to help support the dividend.Going forward, it will be necessary for Seagate to return to growth. Fortunately, the company has a plan to do that, by investing in cloud storage. In the fiscal fourth quarter conference call, CEO Stephen Luczo said:In the meantime, there are promising signs that the core HDD business is firming. Last quarter, Seagate reduced inventory by 6% from the previous quarter and realized higher average selling prices as well, which are good signs that demand remains solid. All signs indicate HDD continues to be an attractive product because of its cost-competitiveness.Updating My Odds of a Dividend CutIn my Apr. 25 article, I concluded with a section handicapping the odds of a dividend cut based on my own expectations. Back then, I gave Seagate's dividend a 60% chance of surviving, which acknowledged that business conditions were difficult, but overall I felt the company could sustain the payout. Now that fiscal 2016 is in the books, and seeing the progress the company has made in its turnaround, I now feel the dividend has about a 70%-80% chance of surviving.To be sure, Seagate does still face significant structural headwinds. The decline in the PC continues, which is weighing on its core hard disk drive business. But Seagate does seem to have turned a corner. The HDD business is still a strong cash flow generator, and the company is aggressively investing in mobile cloud, which should fuel its future growth.Disclaimer: This article represents the opinion of the author, who is not a licensed financial advisor.

Two days later, the stock showed a breakaway gap and dropped by nearly 30%. I'm assuming none of my readers actually opened the strangle position because my students would normally send me emails asking me whether to close in such a situation:What we are looking at here is almost an ideal application of a synthetic strangle. When such a position is held open, you almost certainly want to take profit on the puts at a breakaway gap. Statistically, you are highly unlikely to see such a huge drop more than one day in a row, implying that profit taking is the preferred action.If you had done so, you would have realized nearly 200% ROI. Then, with the long side still open, you would be up 11%. Also, you would have gained $63 from the dividend.Again the play follows:The total ROI till now is around 47%. Or, on a profit-to-risk basis, 180%. This is all under three months' time.Now that we are looking at another breakaway gap, the question of whether to stay, whether to hedge, or whether to go should be on your mind. I could offer another options strategy, but it seems like another issue is more pressing at the moment. Some analysts are calling into question the stability of STX's dividend:While both Dana's and Value's articles are strong from a fundamental point, neither look at the dividend from a budgeting perspective. Today, we run a dividend analysis on STX's dividend to see whether - all things being equal - the company can sustain and, ideally, raise the dividend. Let's begin:First, we should note that the dividend's value is roughly half of that at the time of my last article on STX. Three months ago, investors could have locked in a nice 10% yield. Now, we stand at a little over 5%:One possible concern is the similarity of the present spike to the spike of 2008-2009. We all know how that went. But a high yield is not always the canary in the coal mine.The 2008-2009 spike occurred much more suddenly and occurred when STX was trading at less than half of what it is currently trading at now. In 2004, 2006, and 2012, the dividend yield and stock price diverged without a disaster. What we see now could be a natural part of the business cycle:However, this time we are looking at a highly inflated stock price as a result of STX's buyback program. The reduction of outstanding shares has bolstered the stock price and concealed the falling earnings:Nevertheless, many STX holders are in it for the dividend. Thus, if the company can cover the dividend payout with its cashflows, the dividend investor has little to worry about. Indeed, STX does well in covering its dividend with income:Of course, income goes to more than just dividend payouts, which is why we should also look at how free cash flow covers the dividend:Again, well covered. We also can see the ""danger periods"" more clearly, with FCF dipping below the dividend payout several times in the past. However, since 2009, the company's cash flows have covered the dividend payouts without concern.This analysis should have implications for the stock price, as the dividend has led movements in the stock price till recently:The weakening of the HDD industry has caused many an investor to bail. But a more important aspect is the simple fact that STX's EPS has been quickly dropping to zero:With the recent earnings preview, however, STX might stage a rebound. I'm estimating an EPS of 0.26, which would be the first significant, non-seasonal uptick. In this regard, and with the dividend in no immediate danger, STX still has some decent upside.In many cases layoffs show a weakening business model. But for STX it might just be a manifestation of fiscal responsibility, which is the key to maintaining the dividend. Many investors in this sector often misinterpret company actions and the overall macro environment; for example, we have a tendency to apply consumer sentiment and mindsets to a company that derives much of its income from enterprise, companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and… STX!In the meantime, we should watch STX's EPS for at least one more quarter before taking an aggressively bullish stance. We need to know whether the business environment is truly being refreshed or if this quarter's outperformance is a mere fluke - a sudden but temporary increased need for hardware.And still, if we are looking at a changing macro environment, which seems entirely possible gauging from news of other companies in the sector - e.g., Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) - we should analyze STX in respect to our other choices, lest we fall prey to opportunity cost. In the meantime, I recommend we open an iron condor to capture rising volatility in STX and gain exposure to theta.

You make more product, better product, but its value shrinks on the loading dock, like bananas in the hot sun, and as technologies shift this just gets worse.In storage the technology of choice is shifting from aluminum hard drives with moving read-write heads to silicon flash memory chips. This is happening across the board, not just in client devices like PCs, which now use flash memory almost exclusively, but in cloud data centers where flash is just faster.Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), the co-leader in hard drives with Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), is fighting to adapt, having bought LSI's flash chip business last year to get in on the growth. But it's a struggle. Investors demand bottom line performance, but the top line on the main line keeps shrinking.Seagate's answer is to get out the knife and chop employment.So the market is applauding the fact that Seagate yesterday announced it will cut 6,500 jobs worldwide over the next year, 14% of the workforce, taking a charge of $164 million.This comes just a month after the company announced it would cut 1,600 jobs, and was seen by trading desks as proof Seagate is serious about making a profit. Thus, shares popped 12% overnight, opening July 12 at $27.20. Investors looking for high dividend yields love this story.Both profits and sales at Seagate have been on a downward trajectory for over a year. Seagate earned $291 million, 88 cents per share, on sales of $3.33 billion in the April quarter of 2015, but lost $21 million, 7 cents per share, on sales of $2.95 billion for this year's April quarter. With Seagate having increased its quarterly dividend during that time, from 54 cents/share to 63 cents, something had to give, and that something was jobs.The cuts should help Seagate keep profiting as sales decline. It said the July quarter will see revenue of just $2.65 billion, which it called ""better than expected"" and a record in terms of absolute disk volume. Its previous revenue guidance for July of just $2.3 billion. The final numbers, and numbers for the full year, are due out August 2.For those old enough to remember when hard drives were measured in gigabytes, let alone megabytes, what Seagate does today must sound amazing. It expects to ship 37 million drives this quarter, at an average capacity of 1.7 terabytes (that's 1,700 gigabytes) but an average sales price of just $67.All the market cares about, however, are the dividends. If Seagate can keep up the current 63 cent dividend rate for the next year, it would have a yield of about 10%, even at Tuesday's opening bid. That's the kind of yield master limited partnerships were claiming in the 2013 oil patch, but the collapse of oil prices meant they could not deliver.The question is whether Seagate can, in a shrinking market, or whether hard drives are going to play out like a fracked well."
3994549,74295,2016-08-02T12:57:54-04:00,"Despite a better-than-expected quarter, Seagate again could not cover its dividend with free cash flow.Guidance would seem to indicate more of the same is on the way.Management should cut the dividend and acquire more SSD capacity.","Don't be fooled, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is in trouble. The company reported fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results before the market open on Tuesday, and showed investors that nothing has changed. Seagate is still burning cash and is still watching revenues deteriorate. And the market knows it:STX data by YChartsAs frequent readers of STX on Seeking Alpha might remember, I have called for a dividend cut multiple times in the past. For more information on my reasoning on why a dividend cut is necessary, and why Seagate is a bad investment, you can read my article on this subject here.From the recent run-up of STX (up 27% in a month and up 49% in three months) you might have thought that the company had turned a corner, or had provided results contrary to the narrative of Seagate Technology's moribundity. But no, the signs were still there. The current dividend is unsustainable and revenue declines will just exacerbate what is already an issue.Initially after Q3 results, Seagate had issued absolutely horrendous guidance. In the third quarter, the company reported $2.6 billion in revenue, and expected fourth quarter revenues of $2.3 billion, which was about $300 million below consensus estimates. Then a couple months later, everything was somehow reversed and Seagate issued preliminary Q4 earnings stating they expect revenue of $2.65 billion and that the company is being restructured in attempt to reach a gross margin range of between 27% and 32%. The stock shot up on the news. Underpromise, overdeliver.I wrote an article in reaction to the preliminary earnings in which I stated I was encouraged and impressed by Seagate's expected results. I didn't go so far as to claim the dividend is sustainable, but I said perhaps an immediate cut was not necessary. That article can be found here.However, the reality is that, despite revenue of $2.7 billion, which beat management guidance, consensus estimates, and my expectations, cash flow still could not cover the quarterly dividend payout. Seagate reported operating cash flow of $269 million and capital expenditures of $146 million. This translates to free cash flow of $123 million, which still falls $65 million short of the $188 million quarterly dividend.And maybe you're thinking something along the lines of: ""But the shortfall is so small that Seagate can continue making up the difference with its cash hoard for years!"" My response to that is twofold. 1) The deficit will only get larger as HDDs continue to decline and this trend eats away at Seagate's top line 2) there is better use for the cash than paying it out to shareholders.Seagate spent $727 million in 2016 in payouts, cash that could have been spent on acquiring SSD capacity so Seagate doesn't keel over and die. Sure, boosting gross margin and firing 14% of the workforce will help Seagate get back over the payout hump, but the future does not look bright for HDDs or Seagate. What some have speculated in recent weeks is that Seagate was perhaps a suitor for Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), which of course manufactures, among other things, SSDs. Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) acquired SanDisk (SNDK) in order to get exposure to SSDs and Seagate, in my opinion, should make a similar move for Micron with the same goal in mind.That is, unless shareholders would rather be paid dividends from the sinking ship that is Seagate Technology until it inevitably runs out of steam.Guidance for Q1 2017 is for $2.7 billion in revenue and gross margin of 27%. If there was any hope after the preliminary Q4 results that the HDD market was rebounding, the guidance for Q1 2017 should put those hopes to bed. Revenue is expected to be flat in the September quarter, and while management spun a nice, optimistic story on the conference call, the reality is that STX will likely be dead money or worse in the 2017 fiscal year.Unless we see some miraculous recovery in the HDD market, I expect revenue declines to continue and I expect STX to be a poor investment going forward. Gross margin improvement may provide reprieve for a time, but the restructuring Seagate is undergoing tells me that HDD demand and the company's prospects are not bright. You don't cut 14% of your workforce in an attempt to boost margins unless you're trying to stay afloat in water you know is rising close to your head.I think the best path forward for Seagate is an acquisition of Micron (MU) or some other SSD company, which would require a lot of debt, but would ultimately be better for shareholder value in the long-term. The dividend would need to be cut in order to pay off debt and finance operations, but an overhaul of the company is the optimal strategy in my opinion.Though even without an acquisition, I think the case is strong for a dividend cut right now. Seagate has $4.1 billion in debt as of the end of the fourth quarter, and considering Seagate can't even cover its dividend with free cash flow, it certainly isn't paying off its debt with FCF. Too much about Seagate shows me a company that is treading water instead of trying to swim to shore, even if the shore is a long way off.There are many more stocks out there better than STX.

3982505,45851,2016-06-16T14:05:58-04:00,Seagate’s stock is under pressure from poor results.Lukewarm outlook has caused the dividend yield to rise to 11%.We believe that Seagate cannot sustain its current dividend and will have to reduce its dividend.,"Analysis:Weak Results Pummel Seagate. Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), one of the household names for disk drives, has had a rough year so far. In April, the company reported that revenues had dropped by 22% in the 3rd Quarter of Fiscal 2016 and that earnings had swung from a profit of $291 million to a loss of $21 million. At the same time, Seagate's Gross Margin declined from nearly 29% in the 3rd quarter of 2015 to under 23% in 2016. Not surprisingly, its stock has fallen by close to 35% in the year to date.The decline in Seagate's performance was largely expected: its core product, Hard Disk Drives (HDD), faces considerable headwinds as a result of the decline in personal computer sales, which dipped to an 8-year low in 2015 - and continued to slide by another 11.5% in the first quarter.Dividend Impact. Despite its gloomy fortunes, Seagate maintained its dividend of 63-cents per share and management stated that it believed its dividend to be 'manageable' and 'very defendable against what [Seagate will be] able to generate moving forward.' Its CFO, Dave Morton, also stated that there had been no change to the company's dividend policy and that 'defending the dividend' was the 'first thing it would do [with Seagate's cash flow].'Seagate is currently trading with a dividend yield of around 11%. That puts it head and shoulders above the rest of its peer group and means that any investor who purchases 100 shares of Seagate for $2,272 can expect passive income of around $252 a year.This begs the question: if the dividend is manageable is now the time to buy the stock?Maybe not. For one thing, even Seagate's executives acknowledged that its dividend is at a payout ratio (126%) that is well-above the 30% to 50% payout ratio that it had indicated to investors previously. Seagate's executives hedged that it believed that the payout ration was something company could '[grow] into.'However, drive makers face an even greater conundrum ahead: HDD shipments actually fell at an even faster rate (17%) than PC sales (8%) in 2015. Even worse, by the estimation of both Seagate and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), which happen to be the two largest makers of HDD in the world, the Total Available Market for hard drive-based storage is actually contracting at a significant rate.In that sense, even Seagate's own forecast appears to be at odds with management's statement of being able to grow into its dividend payout ratio. Indeed, Seagate's revenues have actually declined by an average of 2.8% over the past 3 years - a faster rate of revenue slippage than the 1.8% rate of its industry.To be sure, Seagate does have a decent working capital ratio of around 1.6-to-1.00 based on its most recent SEC filings. However, this is a third lower than its working capital ratio of nearly 2.4-to-1.00 from just nine months ago. It's easy to see how this happened: it drew-down nearly $1.4 Billion from its cash over the last 4 quarters - and half of that went to paying dividends. In that sense, unless there is a radical change in the trajectory of its core business, it's difficult to see how it can continue to pay around $188 million in dividends indefinitely.In particular, there is the matter of its debt to resolve. With over $4 Billion in long-term debt and just $1.7 Billion in equity, the company's Gearing is very high at 2.45. In fact, Seagate is considerably more leveraged than its peer group which, on average, has just 40 cents of debt for every dollar of equity.It's also important to note that Seagate's equity declines with each dividend payout it makes when it loses money - or when its dividend payout ratio exceeds 100% - so its Gearing can get worse before it gets better. As any investor knows, debt claims are senior to equity claims so at some point (depending on Seagate's fortunes) the company may have no choice but to cut its dividend or risk falling behind on its debt servicing.Outlook. Looking ahead, Seagate's revenues are expected to fall by 6% a year over the next five years - compared to revenue growth of close to 17% for its industry peers. This divergence could be the result of the shift in the industry: Enterprise shipments are expected to take up 45% of industry petabyte demand by 2018. Seagate already derives 59% of its revenues from Enterprise Cloud/New Storage Applications so there is less headroom for it to grow.ConclusionConsidering the foregoing, we believe that Seagate will be under intense pressure to reduce its dividend before long. The current consensus estimate is for Seagate to earn $1.96/share in Fiscal 2017 - 48% lower than the $3.75/share estimate from just 90 days ago.If we assume that this forward EPS estimate is accurate and that Seagate goes back to a 50% payout ratio, then its quarterly dividend could slide from 63-cents per share to just 24.5-cents per share - a 4.3% dividend yield at the current stock price.Of course, this assumes no change in the stock price - one analyst has come forward and set a $15 target price on the stock - a 34% drop from its current level that would eliminate any cash gains from Seagate's high dividend yield.Interestingly, under these two scenarios we've mentioned, the combination of a lower stock price and reduced annual dividend would reduce Seagate's yield to just 6% -- still below its current level - and not all that attractive to investors.As such, we would caution dividend-seeking investors from being tempted by Seagate's seemingly high dividend yield. The balance of risks suggests that this is unsustainable and that investors should expect a reduced dividend from the company in the year ahead."
3987887,74295,2016-07-12T13:03:50-04:00,"Underpromise and overdeliver seems an applicable description of preliminary Q4 results.Seagate is still in trouble, but significantly less so than investors were led to believe after the third quarter.This really is a dramatic turnaround for the company. My call for an immediate dividend cut needs reassessment.","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) dropped a bombshell after Monday's close, announcing preliminary Q4 results, which indicate a very different situation than investors were led to expect after Q3's disaster of an earnings report. Revenue and gross margin are both expected to be miles better than originally guided for after the third quarter, and what this could indicate about future results requires me to reassess my call for an immediate dividend cut, which I wrote in my past article on Seagate here. STX is up 20% on the news.Considering I wrote that article calling for a dividend cut just four days ago, it might seem like a rather strange and dubious move for me to backtrack now, but Seagate's preliminary Q4 numbers are extraordinarily more encouraging than the numbers investors were expecting. Here's the gist of it:Let's go through this bullet by bullet. First off, I'm not sure how Seagate's management possibly was off on revenue guidance by so much, but regardless this is great news for long investors. Year-over-year revenue is still down almost 10%, but considering revenue was initially guided for a year-over-year decline of more than 20%, this is not bad at all.STX Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe initial $2.3 billion in guidance would have been Seagate's lowest quarterly revenue figure since the middle of the Great Recession. I cannot overstate just how huge this Q4 report is for Seagate. With management's initial guidance, it looked like revenue was deteriorating out of control with no end in sight. This quarter does not give any indication that the HDD market is reversing course, and I don't think it is, but it definitely shows that the company's situation is not as dire as it appeared to be after Q3.Another big positive is the gross margin for the quarter, which Seagate attributed to better-than-expected demand for its HDD offerings. Higher revenue and higher gross margin will likely translate to higher net income at a company aggressively cutting back on expenses. Similarly, higher net income will likely translate to higher operating cash flow, which Seagate desperately needs if it wants to stay afloat. At previous guidance, Seagate looked headed for an atrocious Q4: massive revenue decline both YoY and sequential, further deterioration of gross margin and cash flow, and further evidence that the dividend was unsustainable. And the good news was not done yet.Thirdly, and I think most importantly, we finally got indication that Seagate management was willing to make significant changes in order to increase the viability of the company. In the preliminary Q4 results, management stated that 6,500 employees, roughly 14% of the workforce, would be laid off in order to boost gross margin to between 27% and 32% in the December 2016 quarter. This comes after an announcement on June 29th that it would be laying off 1,600 workers to save $100 million a year in costs.In my article on Seagate and the sustainability of its dividend, I claimed that firing 1,600 employees for $100 million a year was not nearly drastic enough to protect the dividend. The restructuring plan disclosed in the Q4 report is more like it. Seagate had a shortfall of $78 million between cash flow and dividends paid last quarter, and I foresaw this gap widening significantly based on management's original guidance. However, with a revamped gross margin, much higher revenue expectations than initially forecasted, and the high probability that the company will turn a profit in Q4, insufficient cash flow will likely not be an issue this quarter.While most of what I wrote in this article sounds like sunshine and daisies, that is only because of what I am comparing these results to. The original guidance was horrid and by comparison the preliminary results for the fourth quarter are stellar. However, the core problem still remains: the HDD market is moribund. It will still bear fruit for years, but the benefit will become sparser with time. Revenue will continue to decline and cash flow will suffer. The increase in gross margin might soften the blows for a while, but eventually a quarterly dividend of $181 million will be unsustainable. It likely already is.What the Q4 results have shown me is that Seagate does not need to cut its dividend immediately, but the time frame is the only variable that has changed. A yield above 10% for a contracting company with few to no visible growth ahead is just not the correct financial move in my mind. Barring some miraculous comeback in HDD demand or an ace hidden up management's sleeve, the dividend will be slashed. And if management truly wants to turn Seagate's fortunes around, the move should take place sooner rather than later.If you want to stay up-to-date on my articles, you can Follow me by going to my author page or by clicking ""Follow"" at the top of this page.Thanks for reading!"

Last week, the company announced a restructuring plan that would save $100 million annually by cutting 1,600 jobs or 3% of its workforce. While the hard disk drive (""HDD"") market continues to hemorrhage and Seagate continues to lose increasingly more money each quarter, this move to streamline the company appears to be a good idea. In the midst of Seagate's struggles, STX has been hammered mightily:STX data by YChartsWhy the stock was even trading as high as $50 in the first place so recently is a question for another time. For right now, the question is whether STX would make a good stock choice. For growth purposes, the answer is a resounding no. Seagate's revenue has been eroding for a while now and there is no end in sight to the slide.But how about for that juicy 11% dividend yield STX currently boasts? As I have written in my previous article on Seagate, the stock is the textbook definition of a dividend yield trap. Free cash flow of $110 million in Seagate's most recent quarter was not enough to cover the $188 million, leaving a $78 million shortfall.With Seagate struggling for years now, I find it hard to believe that the restructuring announced last week was simply about cutting ""dead weight"" so to speak. If it was, I imagine this decision would have come much earlier. No, Seagate is entering territory where it has to make decisions about where the company's priorities lie. By firing workers in favor of additional cost savings, Seagate is following along a path I described in my previous article as treading water.It has gotten to the point where the dividend has become a distraction. Seagate needs a major, drastic, extreme etc. overhaul of its entire business model if it wants to survive. Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) acquired SanDisk to pivot towards the SSD market. Seagate needs to make a similarly drastic move to pivot itself away from the moribund HDD market, and firing 3% of the workforce for $100 million a year in cost savings is not the answer. Not even remotely close.Seagate spent $95 million in capital expenditures in Q3. That is a pittance for a company that needs to pivot from its core market as soon as possible. But you know what happens if the company spends more on capex? Free cash flow goes down and the dividend shortfall becomes magnified. I don't know whether management are worried about the value of their stock options, are in denial about how much trouble the company is actually in, or are just waiting for the right time, but the dividend needs to be cut and as soon as possible. Cash flow just isn't high enough to cover the payouts any longer:STX Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe savings from the restructuring plan will not come close to offsetting the revenue declines Seagate will continue to suffer in the coming quarters and fiscal years. Before too long, free cash flow might not even positive anymore! Yet somehow management believes it can continue to pay out $188 million per quarter in dividends? Yes, Seagate has $1.2 billion in cash, but it also has more than $4 billion in debt. Raising more debt to finance dividends would be a recipe for disaster and increasing cash flow organically is impossible with current HDD market conditions.Management is doing a disservice to STX investors by electing to maintain the dividend at the expense of actually doing something about the company's plummeting top line. No part of Seagate's current strategy speaks to a plan for future revenue growth or even a plan to stop revenue decline. If you're skeptical, go read the company's Q3 report, which can be found here, and tell me this company can afford to maintain an 11% dividend yield. The dividend has got to go, or at the very least it has to be substantially reduced.But hey, that's just one man's opinion.If you want to stay up-to-date on my articles, you can Follow me by going to my author page or by clicking ""Follow"" at the top of this page.Thanks for reading!"

Buying into a stock that has a 10% yield at the outset is vastly different from watching a stock lose half its value yet pay the same dividends as before. Some are speculating that STX will even cut its dividend, halting its 13 consecutive years of dividend increases (barring a hiccup in 2009).No matter what, the future of STX lies in whether its product becomes obsolete. For STX, the biggest threat is flash will overtake HDD. The transition is possibly already underway, as STX sales have dropped, with customers turning to alternative, flash storage methods.The key triggers of choosing a storage medium relate to cost, speed, and storage. And much like finding the right mate, in this area it's a ""choose two paradigm"": ""cheap,"" ""fast,"" and ""large."" (For choosing a mate, of course, your choices are ""attractive,"" ""fun,"" and ""sane."")For HDD, you have large and cheap. For flash, you have fast and large. Flash is becoming increasingly cheaper, both in acquisition and in operation:Naturally, a ""best-of-all-worlds"" solution will become a more popular solution. Being so, revenue from flash sales will quickly outpace that of HDD sales. This is already in progress:STX has been hurt more by these facts than other companies with significant HDD exposure. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), for instance, is barely down 3% Y/Y. In respect to its HDD business, STX sees itself at a crossroad: pivot or die.Perhaps STX should bite the bullet, cut the dividend, and pivot to flash. I am not a business advisor. But I am an advisor on options, which can significantly reduce the downside risk for investors holding STX.STX Synthetic Strangle:Many investors have heard of a married put, which is purported to be a ""risk minimizer."" The problem with married puts is that they are fundamentally the same as long call options. Because options are additive and because a long position in STX is the equivalent of…a married put is then:The strike price of the bought put, if close enough to the stock price, essentially converts the above strategy to a call - the puts cancel. In other words, shareholders with married puts are still long on the stock, as they hold synthetic call options. But for a stock such as STX, with significant downside risk, a better strategy is a synthetic strangle:So, for 1 lot of STX, you would buy 2 Jul 25 STX puts, essentially the same thing as a married put but with an extra put bought. This drastically changes your position's profile, and gives you a more neutral position.By holding the stock, you gain the 10% dividend yield. But with the synthetic strangle, you also gain unlimited profit on the upside as well as the downside (essentially a short position):Depending on where you put the strike price of the bought puts, you could be more positioned for a move in either direction. In the above option strategy, we are better positioned for an upside move. We also profit purely from volatility increases.Thus, in total, this strategy gives us four ways to profit:Learn More about EarningsMy Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live, here on Seeking Alpha.

That is a red flag that the market is pricing in a cut.But just because the market expects a cut doesn't necessarily mean Seagate will. The company is in a PC-driven downturn, but it still generates a lot of free cash flow.As a Seagate shareholder, here are my own expectations for whether the dividend will be cut or maintained.","To say that Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has had a rough year would be a huge understatement. Shares are down 54% in the past one year.The company is getting hit by a perfect storm of headwinds, including the strengthening U.S. dollar, slowing economic growth in emerging markets like China, and a steep downturn in the PC industry.In an effort to right the ship, Seagate has positioned future growth based on cloud-based products. These efforts have worked in the sense that the company has meaningfully reduced its exposure to the traditional PC market. Less than 35% of Seagate's revenue is now derived from PC-related products. But investors don't seem willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt. As of Friday's close, the stock yields nearly 10%. That's a big red flag that the market is pricing in a dividend cut.That being said, just because the market expects something to happen, doesn't mean it will happen. Seagate is one of the market's riskiest dividends, but as the saying goes, with high risk, comes high reward.Batten Down the HatchesIt goes without saying that this is a bad time to be Seagate. Hard drives are under pressure, not just from newer technology, but also from the steep erosion in the personal computer industry. Technology market research firm Gartner stated that global PC shipments fell 9% in the first quarter, to 64.8 million units - the first time since 2007 that shipments fell below 65 million.Making matters worse, Seagate took a hatchet to its current-quarter outlook. The company now expects $2.6 billion in revenue for the fiscal third quarter, down from previous guidance of $2.7 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Seagate's revenue is likely to drop 21% from the same quarter last year. Furthermore, management expects a 23% gross margin. That compares to prior expectations of a 25.6% gross margin, and a 28.9% gross margin in the same quarter last year.Seagate still commands a leadership position in the hard drive industry - it's expected to retain a 40% market share, even with its reduced guidance-but the downturn in the PC industry is a big drag nonetheless.OK, Things are Bad. Now What?All this bad news is certainly disappointing, although not really surprising. Obviously business conditions are difficult right now for Seagate. Investors can see this simply by Seagate's sky-high dividend yield. That in and of itself is a sign of trouble. As a result, the big question for investors is whether the dividend will be cut.If the company maintains its dividend, this stock could be a major winner - imagining locking up a 10% dividend yield plus any price appreciation from Seagate's turnaround? If the dividend holds, this stock could easily generate annualized returns in the high-teens for an extended period.But these are big ""ifs."" Seagate's guidance takes the company dangerously close to not being able to sustain its payout, and the market certainly doubts the sustainability of the dividend. To get a better feel for what may lie ahead, let's dig in deeper to see exactly how much Seagate needs to cover its dividend. That number is: $188 million. That's how much Seagate needs to generate in free cash flow to sustain its dividend.Now for some good news - that's not a high hurdle to clear. Perhaps the best aspect of Seagate's business is that it is a high cash-flow generator, which is the most critical factor for dividends.The company generated $245 million in free cash flow last quarter. Therefore, it could see free cash flow decline by 26% and still have enough to pay its dividend. Assuming $2.6 billion in revenue this quarter, Seagate would need to generate 7% free cash flow as a percentage of sales. That's certainly not an impossible figure - last quarter Seagate turned 7.4% of revenue into free cash flow.Plus, this doesn't include the multitude of cost-cutting options on the table. Last quarter, the company achieved a 17% reduction in operating expense, equating to $100 million in savings. It's likely Seagate will further reduce capital expenditures this quarter. And, Seagate also has $1.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet. It has stated a goal of keeping its cash balance above $1 billion, so it's still about $300 million above that level.Handicapping the Odds of a CutAs a result, my personal expectations are for the dividend to remain intact - but the odds are only slightly better than 50-50. As a Seagate shareholder, I'm of the mind that there is about a 60% chance the dividend remains intact.Of course, this relies on the PC eventually bottoming out. If PC shipments continue to drop at a nearly double-digit rate, then the dividend is probably going to be cut at some point. Investors need to prepare for that possibility. If the dividend is cut, I'd expect about a 50% reduction, the proceeds of which the company will probably use to buy back stock.The reason I feel the odds are the company will keep the dividend is because Seagate still has levers it can pull to cover the dividend. As bad as things are right now, Seagate still generates a very healthy level of free cash flow, isn't overly burdened by debt and has some spare cash on hand it can use.Disclaimer: This article represents the opinion of the author, who is not a licensed financial advisor.

3970282,25265,2016-05-02T14:47:59-04:00,March quarter results were lousy but guidance for Q2 revenues was even worse.The dividend is clearly unsustainable and is starving the company of cash needed to innovate.Seagate needs to cut the dividend immediately and reinvest the savings in new growth opportunities if it is to maintain its relevancy over the long term.,"Last week Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) reported its fiscal Q3 results and once again it managed to disappoint investors. Revenue of $2.6B was in-line with the preannouncement two weeks ago but down 22 percent year-over-year. Earnings came in lower than already lowered expectations at $0.22 per share versus $0.39 expected. EPS was down 79% YoY. More importantly, cash flows were down as well. Operating cash flows of $205M and capital expenditures of $95M produced free cash flow of $110M. This is down 49% year-over-year. The drop in free cash flow is particularly concerning when you consider the dividend cost the company $188M in the quarter. Seagate continues to feel the effects of a so-so global economy, a strong dollar, weak PC sales and, most importantly, a rapid pivot away from spinning discs for electronic storage. The shift to NAND flash storage is accelerating, with all flash storage arrays quickly penetrating enterprise for mission critical workloads. Guidance for the June quarter was a major disappointment. Seagate estimated revenues will be $2.3B (versus expectations of $2.612B). Gross margins and operating expenses are expected to be ""relatively flat"" with the March quarter. The revenue guide was a major miss and a significant contributor to the stock falling 19 percent on Friday. In addition the company announced a restructuring that will see its HDD build capacity go from 50-60 million units per quarter to 35-40 million units. This more than anything should inform the investment community that unit shipments will likely never again eclipse the levels seen in the March quarter, which were down 21.6% year-over-year. In addition, this restructuring will cost the company $150M over the next several quarters, per the CEO on the earnings call.Time for a RebootIt should be clear to all that Seagate is in trouble. They failed to see the freight train that is NAND flash barreling toward them. The moves the company has made to date are minor and are not enough to save the dividend from being cut. Macroeconomic uncertainties have not helped Seagate either, but the majority of the pain is self inflicted. Just six months ago Seagate closed on the Dot-Hill acquisition (a maker of HDD-based storage systems) for $634M in cash, most of which was allocated to goodwill. In the March quarter Seagate reported a revenue decline in the Enterprise Systems, Flash and Other revenue product line ($224M versus $259M in the previous quarter). I expect a write-off of the goodwill associated with Dot-Hill could come as soon as June 30, the end of Seagate's fiscal year.The dividend is now in danger of being cut. Earnings are well below the dividend payout at present. The company has a net debt position of $3B. In addition the company has minimum annual capital expenditure requirements of $400M and $150M in cash restructuring costs to right size its manufacturing footprint over the next several quarters. The dividend is starving Seagate of innovation. How can the company be expected to move beyond HDDs when all the cash it generates is being sucked out? If it continues on this path it will reach obsolesce sooner rather than later. The dividend should immediately be cut by at least 80 percent. The resulting cash flow should not be used to buy back stock but rather it should be reinvested in the business so that Seagate can have a chance of not just surviving but thriving over the next 10 years.Options for GrowthI think Seagate needs to move beyond making hardware for storage. It could try to make a bigger push into enterprise SSDs and possibly flash storage arrays. However these businesses are already dominated by large, established companies, many of which have a cost advantage due to scale and their own silicon wafer production. Getting deeper into the flash array business would require a lot of R&D and likely a lot of losses in the early years of development. Seagate also would be competing with much deeper pockets, such as Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), EMC (EMC), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), NetAPP (NASDAQ:NTAP) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG). Instead of moving down the hardware stack, Seagate should pivot to software. I think Seagate should look to make some acquisitions in big data analytics. Big data (i.e., using software to make sense of large data sets to spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on) is still in its infancy. While there are a lot of competitors already in this space, I believe Seagate could look to enter this market via niche acquisitions and attempt to use its resources to create a new line of business for itself. While there are no guarantees this or any other strategy would succeed, I believe it is better than the alternative. If Seagate continues to starve itself of innovation for the sake of maintaining a dividend that, frankly, is not doing shareholders much good considering the drop in the stock the past few days, it will likely move to obsolesce sooner rather than later. The company needs to innovate if it is ever going to have a chance of growing again. Cutting R&D and capital expenditures so that it can maintain an unsustainable dividend makes no sense. Neither does cutting the dividend and using the savings to buy back stock. Investors do not like to own companies that are continually shrinking, regardless of shareholder returns. Clearly investors today do not believe the dividend is sustainable. There were wholesale downgrades of the stock this morning from the sell side:Via BloombergIt is time to rip the Band-Aid off and cut the dividend. The stock would likely rally on the news. But in order for Seagate to survive in the long term it must find a new way to grow. It cannot starve itself of growth opportunities just to maintain an unsustainable shareholder return. That will only accelerate the end game. I don't know what growth area would have the highest probability of success for Seagate, but I'm sure there are a lot of smart people on its Board of Directors and the management team. They can also bring in consultants. They need to seriously consider any and all possible new growth avenues for the company. Otherwise, if it continues on the path it is currently - one of starving the company of growth for the sake of maintaining a dividend payout - it will only accelerate the demise. Shareholders would be better served if the company tendered for some of its own debt vs. buying back stock. Its long-dated paper (2034 maturity) trades at 67 cents on the dollar as of today and is probably headed lower.Taking this debt out would be accretive to shareholders and lower its leverage position - adding further certainty to the equity. The fat lady is in the background warming up her voice. Time for Seagate to face the facts and find a way to grow outside of the storage business. The sense of urgency has never been greater."

(The chart as provided by FINRA).Over the past 12 months, STX's stock hit a 52-week high of $60.09 and a 52-week low of $25.54 (intra day stock price on 04/15/2016) - this represents a roughly 58% drop in STX's stock price. Interestingly, STX managed to raise its dividend, in November, from $.54 to $.63. Between STX's dividend increase and STX's stock price decline, STX now sports a very large 9.85% yield ($2.52/$25.59). STX's large dividend has recently garnered the attention of investors seeking yield. However, given STX's decline, I believe it is important for potential investors to take into account the possibility STX will cut its dividend. One objective way to gauge the probability of a company cutting its dividend is by using the options market to estimate implied dividend payments. The options implied dividend is basically the average dividend payment expectation of all option traders at a moment in time. Given the high level of institutional involvement in the options market, the implied dividend also can be seen as the dividend expectations of large institutions.It is also important to note STX's 2023, 2025 and 2034 bonds are all trading above 8.5% YTM as of 04/14/2016. According to data provided by FRED, junk bond yields are trading at an over the treasury yield curve - about 6.62% as of 04/15/2016. Based on these OAS figures, it is safe to say STX bonds are currently in junk territory even though they are currently rated as investment grade by the rating agencies. High bond rates make it difficult for management teams to fund and justify dividends.Options Implied Dividend PaymentsThe table below shows all the information needed to calculate options implied dividends. The information on the table was acquired at approximately 8.50 A.M. CST on 04/15/2016. When calculating implied dividends, you must be sure to acquire all your information simultaneously because each input depends on the value of the other - the borrow rate affects the put price. (The one-year risk-free rate reflects the yield on the one-year US Treasury on 04/14/2016.)Put - Call + I - Borrow = Implied Dividend$3.98 - ($4.03 - $1.51) + $.10 - $.20 = $1.36Based on this equation, the options market is pricing in a total of $1.36 in dividends between 04/15/2016 and 01/20/2017 vs. $1.89 at the current distribution rate ($.63/quarter). In this case, the options market is pricing in a 28% dividend cut for STX over the next three dividend payments.(It is important to note when estimating implied dividends, we will receive results that vary from the expected due to small discrepancies between the actual options market and the frictionless options market in which the put-call parity equation was created. However, the discrepancies are usually capped at around .5% of the stock price of the underlying equity.)Risks and AssumptionsThe following is a list of some of the risks associated with my methodology as well as some of the assumptions I take when calculating implied dividends.1.) The equation I use requires the stock price to equal the strike price. When this is not the case, I adjust by subtracting the options intrinsic value. This will subsequently create a discrepancy in part due to differences in the delta of the options being used.2.) I rely on the option and stock price information I receive to be accurate.3.) The borrow cost my broker quotes me might not necessarily be the going market rate at the time.4.) I do not take transaction costs into consideration when calculating implied dividends.5.) I rely on the notion of efficient pricing for stocks and options.6.) Implied dividends change constantly, so the usefulness of the information provided by calculating implied dividends changes over time.Lastly, keep in mind implied dividends represent an average expected dividend cut among investors, not a median expected dividend cut. So, rather than looking at an implied dividend cut as a target, you could be better served by seeing it as an increase in investor distrust in the ability or willingness of a company to continue to pay out a dividend.ConclusionThe options market is currently pricing in an approximately 28% dividend cut for STX. While management can technically continue to pay out its current dividend, it appears that the market does not believe they have the ability and/or willingness to sustain their current dividend. It is also important to note mathematically dividends should not play a role in stock price performance. If STX were to cut its dividend, STX stock price would not necessarily fall or increase. The main purpose of this article is to provide investors with information which can help them better evaluate STX's dividend."

But complementary channels of income are being built, and the company is positive about returns on that front.Does the company have strong enough financials to take a further beating on stock price and keep on ticking on dividends?Is this risky investment worth the trouble? It might well be.","Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) is a 35-year veteran of the data storage business with 52,000 employees around the world and 9,000 patents to its credit.In recent times, the company has been moving from being purely a data storage provider to a company that provides solutions aimed at harnessing that stored data - a significant transition that has been forced due to the disruption that is taking place in the increasingly interconnected world.Cloud solution providers are slowly taking away the necessity to store things locally. Gone are the days when Gmail offered few GBs of storage - we have unlimited storage now. With each passing day, the need to even store media files locally is diminishing - if not on its way to becoming extinct. The question is: Why even bother with local storage when I have Instagram and Flickr that can hold my pictures, and YouTube to take care of large video files. So, from the personal usage perspective, the need to store data locally is thinning, with company after company fighting for my presence.Furthermore, PCs are on the wane and mobile devices are on the rise, further denting the storage requirement that is the bread and butter of data storage companies such as Seagate.Things get even more depressing when you look at the data storage requirement from the enterprise angle. The cloud industry has taken off in a big way, and enterprises are slowly adopting this new technology that promises to take care of the infrastructure headache with a simple solution. To put it in another way, Amazon and Microsoft are telling companies to forget creating an IT infrastructure unit - especially if you are a company with average data operation requirements.The requirement for personal data storage is declining, and it will continue as cloud takes off, thus severely affecting the core offering of Seagate. Welcome to the world of technology, where disruption is as common as a Saturday night out. Seagate now stands at the crossroads, and is trying to establish itself as the company that is ready to take on the highly cloudified mobile world.Outlook for the Industry, Guidance and Details from Recent Quarterly ReportsWith data volumes doubling every two years, and big data slowly making its presence felt in our lives, where is all this data is going to be stored? That is where companies like Seagate, Hitachi (OTCPK:HTHIF) and other data storage providers come in.But the growth in data storage requirements is clearly moving towards cloud. In 2014, Enterprise Tech estimated that ""AWS probably has somewhere between 2.8 million and 5.6 million servers across its infrastructure."" Add IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to that and we're looking at massive cloud infrastructure capacity. And you can already see the downslope of HDD storage requirements around the world:To offset the loss from a declining HDD storage business, Seagate is now betting on cloud storage systems to complement that income. With the cloud industry growing at a healthy rate, Seagate is planning to capitalize on that trend.Worldwide Public Cloud Services Forecast (Billions of U.S. Dollars)BPaaS = business process as a service; PaaS = platform as a serviceSource: Gartner (January 2016)So, how much business is Seagate actually losing because of cloud and other factors?Revenue DeclineAs you can clearly see, revenue has steadily declined over the last year, while the stock was hammered. But it will be unfair to expect the revenue stream, which is dependent on HDD storage devices that, in turn, are dependent on overall personal computer sales to come down to naught.I totally agree that PCs are on the wane with tablets and mobile devices taking over their place. But to expect a non-existent PC world is still many years away - if at all such a thing happens. Seagate has already been pushing for alternate revenue streams such as cloud storage systems and entry into the growing flash storage market via its acquisition of LSI Flash Storage Business.The offsets are in place, but the growth is not enough to compensate for the current speed of revenue loss in the existing business lines - which is exactly the reason why the stock has been hammered so hard.Current Dividend Yield, Dividend HistorySource: STX PresentationIn a span of five quarters, the company has raised dividends from $0.43 in Q1 2015 to $0.63 in Q2 2016 - a move possibly aimed at arresting the stock's drop of more than 50% during the same time.Financial StrengthCapex requirement has been under $1 billion, with free cash flow just above the $1 billion mark.Seagate carries a long-term debt load of $4.1 billion with a cash balance of $1.2 billion. Considering the cash flow generated by the company, and with operating margins in excess of 20%, the company has enough financial strength to weather the storm and keep moving forward.The balance sheet is what is making the current dividend yield an extremely attractive proposition - and let's not forget the stock's upside once the other parts of the business start rising up.With a limited downside as described above, a strong balance sheet, the near-10% yield and the upside potential, Seagate is a worthwhile risk."

Context is important here: Pandora (NYSE:P) went into earnings down over 75% from its early-2014 highs, and trades for just 1.6x its 2016 sales consensus. Against such a backdrop, beating sales estimates (while missing on EPS), slightly improving full-year revenue guidance, and moderately reducing full-year adjusted EBITDA loss guidance is enough to spark a rally.Nonetheless, with Spotify and Apple Music still seeing strong growth, and Amazon's Prime Music and Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) YouTube Red also providing competition, listener hours rose just 4% Y/Y to 5.52B.

Apple, secretive as ever, has given no indication as to what it's using the acquired fab for.The facility is much too small to handle production of Apple's A-series processors (currently made by TSMC/Samsung), and besides, developing the advanced manufacturing processes needed for them would be a multi-billion dollar investment. But Apple's chip development work has expanded to cover other chips such as fingerprint sensors, SSD controllers, and LCD timing controllers. AppleInsider notes Maxim used the San Jose facility to produce MEMS sensors; MEMS parts found in iOS devices (they're all supplied by third parties) include motion sensors, barometers, and microphones.WSJ: Chinese government proposes owning small stakes in local web giants - Chinese regulators are reportedly ""soliciting companies' opinions"" for the proposal, which calls for buying a 1% stake and obtaining a board seat at companies overseen by two regulatory bodies. The WSJ notes those companies include Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES), and ""almost all big online media companies.""Your latest reminder that the Chinese government remains a very active presence in the local Internet industry, particularly in areas related to content sharing and publishing. Baidu, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and others have gone to great lengths to establish strong government ties, but that doesn't guarantee regulators won't seek greater control down the line over how the companies do business.

Facebook bought LiveRail, whose clients include online video publishers such as CBS, Univision, A&E Network, and the MLB, for a reported $400M-$500M in 2014. In a statement, the company says it's ""removing certain parts of the LiveRail business that weren't creating value,"" such as LiveRail's ad server the certain publishers that didn't meet Facebook's quality standards.Facebook has been trying to sell publishers on its Atlas ad server (there have apparently been some challenges here as well), which the company claims can deliver superior cross-device ad tracking and measurement than rival platforms such as Google's DoubleClick thanks to its reliance on anonymized Facebook user profiles rather than cookies. Also, in a move highlighting Facebook's interest in ad quality, the company recently pulled the plug on an Atlas ad-buying solution after finding it was plagued by ""bad ads and fraud."" Notably, Facebook said at the time video ad native ads were the two formats delivering ""significant value"" for publishers. This looks like a retrenchment for Facebook's efforts to drive video ad sales on third-party sites/apps, rather than an exit.Snapchat partners with NBC on Summer Olympics video content - Snapchat (CHAT) will provide Olympics video content from NBC (NASDAQ:CMCSA) through its Discover media service (existing partners include CNN, Yahoo News, and ESPN) in the U.S., and share related ad revenue. The deal highlights Snapchat's growing value to media firms as a way of reaching younger U.S. consumers. Bloomberg recently reported Snapchat is now seeing 10B daily video videos, up from 8B in February - Snapchat's Stories feature, which lets users share photos/videos that disappear after 24 hours, has fueled much of the growth. Facebook was at 8B views as of last November.TV broadcasters offer to sell 126MHz. of spectrum through upcoming FCC auction - 126MHz. is the maximum amount of spectrum the FCC hoped to offer through the auction, which involves spectrum in the low-frequency 600MHz. band (good for rural and in-building coverage).The auction, which has been forecast to raise $60B or more, could make it easier for expected bidders Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) to offer comprehensive 5G coverage - much of the initial work on 5G has been on using high-frequency bands that can enable multi-gigabit download speeds, but which bring with them range and in-building challenges engineers are trying hard to address. It could also give T-Mobile a chance (at a price) to narrow Verizon/AT&T's rural coverage edge, and potentially (though this might be easier said than done) open the door for a bidder such as Comcast or Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) to launch a new nationwide mobile network.Wells Fargo thinks AT&T could spend $10B through the auction, T-Mobile $8B, and Verizon $5B. Cash-strapped Sprint (NYSE:S) is sitting the auction out.WSJ: Hulu prepping cable-style online TV service - Hulu, co-owned by Disney (NYSE:DIS), Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA), and Comcast/NBCUniversal, would join Dish and Sony in offering a web TV service. A Verizon offering appears to be on the way, and Apple has reportedly delayed a planned entry into the market due to licensing issues. The fact its owners control many popular TV channel should aid Hulu's entry into the market.In spite of strong old-media support (or perhaps because of it), Hulu is a distant third in the subscription streaming market behind Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company finally gained the sense to provide an ad-free option for Hulu Plus last year, but at $11.99/month, it's more costly than either Netflix or Amazon Prime. An online TV service featuring its owners' channels (and presumably others) and bundled traditional Hulu far would let Hulu change the playing field.Two lingering questions for Hulu's service: 1) Will Comcast, which is trying to minimize pay-TV subscriber losses, agree to license NBC's channels at a reasonable price? The WSJ says Comcast ""hasn't agreed to license its networks"" yet. 2) Will Hulu price the service in a way that will appeal to many cord-cutters, or will it (given Comcast's concerns and Disney/Fox's interest in keeping pay-TV clients happy) go with large channel bundles and premium pricing? Given the huge compromises Hulu has made to date to keep its owners happy - the free/ad-supported Hulu service still isn't supported on living room devices such as Roku's set-tops and Apple TV - the devil could end up being in the details.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3972504,64693,2016-05-06T17:55:33-04:00,Fasten your seat belt – it could still be bumpy.Earnings mirror the trend in PC sales.Don’t hang your hat on that huge dividend.The cloud is not ethereal.,"If your investment horizon is three years or longer (and if it's not, you shouldn't be buying stocks anyway), you need to consider adding Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX) to your portfolio. Seagate is one of the world's largest manufacturers of hard drives used to store data in personal computers. This is the main reason the stock is out of favor. But I believe that STX will reward the patient investor who can tolerate a little volatility and ignore the noise surrounding the company.Now, there's no question that the stock has been in a virtual free fall since January 2015, and technically it looks terrible. Take a look at the chart below. It isn't pretty. So, at least in the very short term, it looks as if the path of least resistance is to go lower.Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comNevertheless, the stock looks attractive to me in the range where it's trading now. I'll get to that later. For now, let's focus on the issues currently hanging over STX and what's driving the stock lower.The first issue is lower forecasted PC demand. The market is viewing STX as a proxy for PC sales. And, clearly, demand for the old personal computer is waning. Smartphones, tablets and other portable gadgets have all the computing power of a PC but are less expensive and a heck of a lot easier to carry around. As a result, sales of personal computers (desktops and laptops alike) have been declining every year since 2011 when worldwide shipments topped out at 364 million units. Annual shipments have slipped by nearly 24% since then. According to data compiled by Statista, for the year ended 12/31/2015, worldwide PC shipments totaled fewer than 277 million units. And analysts expect that trend to continue through 2016. Industry data show that PC sales are forecast to fall an additional 6.0% or so this year. And, logically, lower PC sales mean lower shipments of hard drives to those manufacturers.This is straightforward stuff and, quite frankly, STX's EPS have mirrored this downtrend. STX's quarterly earnings last peaked at $2.24 (on a non-GAAP basis) back in March 2012. They have declined every year since. When STX reported its latest quarter (3Q fiscal 2016) at the end of April, EPS came in at $0.22 (again, on a non-GAAP basis). And the expectation is that, like PC sales, STX's earnings will be lower for the remainder of 2016 and into fiscal 2017. STX's fiscal year ends on July 31.OK. So, that's bad news for the stock and analysts have been quick to lower estimates for STX. There have been 10 downgrades in just the last several weeks. This is a significant issue hanging over STX's head. Another issue weighing on the stock is its dividend, which some analysts say the company can't afford to keep paying.At the current price, STX's $2.52 dividend yields a whopping 11.58%. In an environment where savers are lucky to get 2.0% on a five-year CD, it's obvious what the market is saying - that dividend is gonna get cut! I think that is a safe assumption. And company officials have all but confirmed that message.In the press release that accompanied STX's earnings announcement, we were told that, ""The payment of any future quarterly dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon Seagate's financial position, results of operations, available cash, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.""But, I'm not suggesting that investors buy the stock for the income, even though I believe that STX can clearly afford to keep paying that dividend. Take a look below at the consolidated cash flow statement released last month. Notice the amount of money used to repurchase stock and pay dividends. That's more than $1.6 billion, boys and girls! Add that back and STX is in a better cash position than it was the year before. Not too bad for a company whose earnings have been in a five-year decline. Make no mistake though - STX is not in decline.(Source: Company filings)There are three reasons I suggest that investors buy STX: the consensus view is typically wrong. I believe an investment's potential is revealed by looking forward, not backward, and the fundamentals support a higher valuation. Let's deal with the consensus first.As I noted above, since STX reported earnings, there have been a bevy of downgrades and outright ""sell"" recommendations. The consensus view is that STX is a dog and investors should avoid it. However, back in 2011, there wasn't anyone on ""the street"" with anything lower than a ""Hold"" recommendation. When you review the table below you'll see that big brokerage house analysts seem to perennially tell investors to buy high and to sell low. Hence, my comment about the consensus view.(Source: briefing.com)So, now, let's take with a grain of salt the issues of the past and focus our attention on the future.According to IDC, PC sales should begin to recover in 2017. They see that recovery coming ""when the prospect of the next refresh cycle and the cessation of a free Windows 10 upgrade should provide opportunities in notebooks and commercial segments."" Gartner Group agrees saying that worldwide PC shipments should increase 4% in 2017. Neither firm sees consumer demand picking up until 2019, but in the final analysis each agrees that the PC is not dead.So, if PC sales pick up in 2017 led by business purchases and then consumers come back into the picture a couple years later, I see a clear path for earnings growth for STX. This is the case because you have to store your data somewhere. And that somewhere is your computer's hard drive. But, going forward, I believe that there is more to like at STX beyond tepid PC growth through 2020. I believe that the company is setting itself up for the next phase of growth.Late last year STX acquired a company called Dot Hill Systems. Dot Hill makes software and hardware storage systems that help expand STX's cloud storage systems business. It's a strategic shift for STX. As more and more data ends up ""in the cloud"" that data needs to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere is on hard disks.The company also has made investments that help grow its ""Flash Business"" and storage solutions portfolio. So, I believe that this diversification will be additive to earnings into the foreseeable future.On top of all of this, STX is still a fundamentally sound company. With a Quick Ratio of 1.08 and more than $1.3 billion in working capital, this is a solid balance sheet.(Source: Company filings)Then, when you compare other valuation metrics to the overall market, I think you get STX at a bargain price. It trades for less than 10 times forward earnings when the broader market is closer to 18. And you aren't overpaying for sales. The current share price is about one-half of sales per share. And finally, STX still has a lot of cash in its coffers - approximately $4.00 per share. Here's a couple more reasons I think STX is a buy:(Source: Capital IQ)I don't think STX Chairman and CEO Stephen Luczo is out of his mind. Just before the stock suffered its most recent walloping, Luczo bought an additional 200,000 shares in the open market. This was not an option exercise. He paid cash out of his own pocket. He now owns more than 1.6 million shares of STX.Luczo has been with STX since 1993. He's as informed an insider as an insider can be. There isn't likely anyone else at STX that has been there as long or who understands the business and culture as well as Luczo. His timing might be off, but I believe he may well be onto something. And I love it when the guy at the helm has skin in the game. It's more than symbolic. It means something. I think you're well served to be investing next to Steve Luczo.ConclusionIf you're patient and can stomach a little more volatility (maybe mostly on the downside) for the short term, you'll ultimately be rewarded for owning STX. In the near term the stock could get a positive bounce if the dividend gets cut or eliminated. But there's still an outside chance that it doesn't, and then your total return is really sensational. Prospects look good and there's a clear path to earnings growth in the next 12 months. STX is a buy."
3961700,25265,2016-03-29T12:26:27-04:00,"Many of the bull arguments fail to adequately quantify future risks to Seagate's cash flows.I believe significant top-line pressure will continue, putting pressure on cash flow generation and the dividend payout ratio.The stock could re-rate to a significantly lower multiple once the market realizes the dividend is in danger of getting cut.Investors should sell today and look for a safer yield elsewhere.","Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) has drawn a considerable investor base from those seeking current income for retirement. With a dividend yield of 7.5%, the stock can look very attractive to many. However looks can be deceiving. Seagate's financial performance is deteriorating at a rapid pace. What might look like a ""safe"" dividend today could be anything but in the next 6-12 months. Let's review some of the common misconceptions bulls point to as reasons to own the stock.Misconception 1 - The dividend is affordable and safeThe current dividend costs the company ~$750M per year. The best way to determine whether Seagate can afford this payout is to calculate the company's free cash flow. This measure calculates how much cash the company generates from its business after making necessary investments in capital expenditures each year. During the past 12 months, Seagate generated $1.1B in FCF. So clearly $750M is less than $1.1B, so Seagate generates enough cash today from its ongoing operations to cover the current dividend with cash left over it can use to either buyback stock, repay debt, make acquisitions or just park on the balance sheet for use at a future time. However investors should not take comfort in the current payout ratio of 68%. Seagate's FCF is not at all steady. In fact, since margins peaked in 2012, FCF is down a staggering 58%.The rate of decline this fiscal year alone is staggering - from $1.9B in FY2015 to $1.1B currently. This is principally the result of lower margins and significantly lower revenues.Here you can see the rapid decline in Seagate's business over the past several quarters. Competitor Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) also is experiencing significant top-line burn, though recent performance has bested Seagate by several percentage points. The rapid decline in sales is being led by the consumer (Client Compute) segment.As you can see from this data pulled from Seagate's quarterly earnings supplement, client units sold fell by more than 10 million year-over-year in the December quarter. Ouch. That is worrisome. This alone equates to ~$575M in lost revenue for the quarter (assuming a $55 average drive price) and $130M in gross margin (assume 23% gross margin). Extrapolate that for an entire year and the loss of the PC business to SSD and mobile only users seriously calls into question the size of the current dividend. It would be a mistake for investors to just assume that the declines end here - I expect sales losses for HDDs to continue as NAND flash continues to decline in price and as fewer consumers purchase PCs.The current dividend payout ratio (dividend/free-cash-flow) is 68%, so on a last 12-month basis yes the dividend is safe. But one cannot use that ratio to evaluate the safety of the dividend going forward. After all, the company's own guidance for the March quarter calls for another 19% drop in revenues. That will only increase the payout ratio further. This should continue until such time as it reaches 100%. At that point Seagate likely bites the bullet and cuts the dividend, by at least half I expect. It will then have to focus on reducing its debt burden, which will be too large for the significantly smaller Seagate.Misconception 2 - Seagate's enterprise business will save the companyEnterprise total capacity sold is increasing but the actual number of drive sales is not. We know that Seagate had trouble with its nearline storage product in Q1 FY2016, which somewhat abated in Q2. The company should have a fully competitive product lineup very soon. However that likely would not have been enough to grow the total number of drives sold. The fact remains that flash is coming for enterprise as well. If you listen to the earnings calls for companies like EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), you would know that sales of all-flash storage arrays are growing exponentially. Traditional storage arrays are on the decline and will likely continue to see declining sales for the foreseeable future.Misconception 3 - Seagate's non-HDD businesses will save the companySeagate does have a billion-dollar business that does not involve manufacturing HDDs. It sells enterprise storage systems (the acquisition of Dot-Hill last fall), flash drives, flash controller technology and other miscellaneous. Seagate projects this category will grow at ~10% this year. So $1B in sales could hit $1.1B. That's a solid growth rate, but I fail to see how it will offset the declines in the HDD business anytime soon and stabilize operations. The non-HDD business is only 9% of total revenues. That is just not enough to stabilize the business anytime soon when the other 91% of sales are dropping mid- to high-teens. Investors banking on Seagate's new super fast enterprise SSD to save the company will be sorely disappointed. The competition in flash drives is intense. And Seagate does not have its own in-house flash supply, so it needs to buy it from someone else, who then marks up the price to make a profit. That means Seagate will have a margin disadvantage versus Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), SanDisk (SNDK), Toshiba, etc. on every unit they sell. Also, sales of any one product at Seagate is not likely to move the needle a great deal, HDD, flash or otherwise.Misconception 4- Seagate deserves its current trading multipleSeagate is trading at 12.2x current year's EPS, the highest that ratio has been in the past three years. A 12x earnings multiple is about as high as an investor should feel comfortable owning any technology hardware company as they can be highly cyclical or in Seagate's case vulnerable to new disruptive technologies. The street is currently expecting $2.75/share in earnings in FY2016 (ending June 30) on revenues of $11.34B, which would be down 33.2% and 17.5%, respectively. As of today, street estimates for FY2017 assume revenues stabilize and earnings climb by 35% to $3.71/share. I'm highly skeptical of revenues stabilizing given the secular headwinds facing HDDs. But margins could improve as the company fully integrates its former Samsung operations in China after the MOFCOM decision last fall. While profitability could improve for a short time, the topline pressure will continue. With the uncertainty surrounding Seagate's future earnings potential, it seems a more appropriate trading multiple would be 8x. As you can see, the multiple was as low as ~6.5x in 2013. An 8x multiple would put the stock at $22, or 34% lower than today. It would take four years of dividends to recoup those losses, assuming Seagate can still afford to make the current payout for the next four years, which I do not think it will.ConclusionsNo one can say for certain how much longer HDDs will continue to enjoy widespread adoption in the electronic storage industry. But flash is certainly coming for its lunch money. PC sales weakness appears to be perpetual now versus cyclical in the past. When evaluating the ""safety"" of the dividend, no investor should look at today's results in isolation when the current topline burn is nearly 20%. The most efficient company in the world could not maintain profitability with that kind of revenue loss. While the current dividend is certainly attractive for income investors, I'd recommend looking elsewhere for yield. Seagate's stock could easily get re-rated to a much lower multiple, which would wipe out multiple years of dividends. The dividend is likely the only thing keeping the stock at this current level. When the cash flow continues to fall, the market will realize a dividend cut is on the table. You do not want to be holding shares when this happens. Sell today and look for yield elsewhere."

His major theme is that economic growth is driven by cycles of technological innovation. As a particular innovation begins, it results in slow growth as the new technologies take hold. As the same cycle matures, growth peaks (sometimes decades later), and it frequently ends in a price bubble. The ebb and flow of separate cycles cause huge amounts of confusion in markets. In order to understand how a market might evolve, it is necessary to analyze each technology cycle independently. Schumpeter (who coined the phrase ""creative destruction"") goes on to argue that technologies or markets rarely change discontinuously. Instead, they evolve in a way that reflects the basic economics of the time. It is the entrepreneurs who figure out how to adapt available technologies within their current economic circumstances to meet the needs of the marketplace.A Secular Trend Hidden by the Confluence of Two CyclesThe ""PC industry"" is undergoing a tremendous shift to what is called ""cloud computing."" This transition is the largest since the PC caused the move away from mainframe computing. At its core, ""cloud computing"" is nothing more than having access to one's data and files from anywhere, at any time, through any device. For the data to be available, it has to be stored in an accessible place. This process represents a huge opportunity for some of the companies in the PC supply chain, particularly those that supply data storage products. However, the transition to this new landscape is being complicated by two other distinct, but related cycles:1) The massive extension of the PC life-cycle (was every two years, lengthening past three-plus years)2) The slowdown/ending of Moore's law (was every 18 months, lengthening past two-plus years)In order to understand how this need will be met, it is necessary to look at these trends independently.Cloud Computing - Exploding Data Available Everywhere Requires Lots of StorageThe following figure, figure 1, shows data creation and storage increasing at a 40% compounded annualized growth rate.Figure 1: Chart showing global data created and shared from 2005 to 2012 (2013 and beyond are projected.SourceThis growth rate is being driven by factors such as video streaming which is available anywhere/anyplace, businesses transitioning to cloud infrastructure, services such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) and eventually by devices such as self-driving cars. In other words, cloud computing requires lots of storage to work.PC Sales SlumpingHowever, no transition of this magnitude occurs in a vacuum. As cloud computing gains in momentum, it is putting the old paradigm under tremendous pressure. The aforementioned PC decline, which includes desktop computers, tablets and Macs, is represented in figure 2, below. By enabling people to do more with smaller devices, cloud computing has disrupted the need to upgrade a personal computer every two years.Figure 2: Year-over-year growth, from 2010 to mid-2015, of global PC shipments.SourceTwo Types of StorageData are predominantly stored on two types of storage technologies - hard disk drives, or ""HDDs"" and solid state drives, or ""SSDs."" SSDs are made from semiconductor chips and have no moving mechanical parts. In contrast, HDDs do have moving mechanical parts. As a result, these two technologies have radically different economics. HDDs are far less capital intensive to produce. In contrast, SSDs are more expensive but small, light and rugged. These features have driven SSD adoption in various forms of PCs, especially mobile or more compact computers, replacing HDDs. HDDs on the other hand, while bulkier, are still the far cheaper alternative. Any quick search through multiple online sources will show that the typical SSD costs about $0.35 per gigabyte, whereas the typical HDD costs about $0.05 per gigabyte. SSDs are approximately seven times more expensive than HDDs. Overall, pricing in the industry has been highly cyclical.Semiconductor Cycle - Poor Returns on Invested Capital Limit InvestmentIn any industry, cyclical pricing favors the least capital intensive solution. HDDs only require about 6% of their sales to be reinvested in the business. This compares to SDD component manufacturers that require 15% to 25% of revenues to be reinvested back into the business.This reality is unlikely to change any time soon because the rate of SSD improvement is slowing down. The slowdown in this rate (commonly referred to as Moore's law) has two implications. First, R&D expenses are increasing, and second, the cost of new manufacturing capacity is increasing. As a result, the drivers of returns on invested capital (ROIC)[1] are being squeezed by rising equipment costs and rising R&D expenses. In a nutshell, continued improvement in SSD technology is coming at an increasing cost.Historically, the storage industry has been highly cyclical. The effect of cyclical pricing and high capital intensity is shown in the table below. Table 1 shows the average over the last 10 years for two SSD manufacturers and two HDD manufacturers.Table 1: 10-year average of returns on invested capital for various HHD and SSD manufacturers.[2]Consequence of Two Cycles Ending - Less CapacityThe changes in the PC cycle and Moore's law are combining to limit overall capital investment and force continued consolidation. In combination, these two facts explain why the shares of certain SSD component makers (such as Micron (NASDAQ:MU)) are trading at book value.In consequence, the capacity to meet the avalanche of cloud-driven demand is not being built. Gartner expects the SSD industry requires hundreds of billions of additional dollars in investment to build the necessary production capacity to meet a fraction of the upcoming enterprise storage demand (this is multiples of the total amount spent in the last 10 years combined).[3] Importantly, extra infrastructure is unlikely to be built until the returns improve and stay high enough to convince the market that they are sustainable. Indeed, the opposite is happening as consolidation continues, with Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) purchase of SanDisk (SNDK)[4] and the probable exit of Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY) from manufacturing disk drives.SummaryOverall, it is clear the storage device makers' stocks could offer an interesting opportunity because the secular growth of data is being temporarily offset by the slowdown in PC sales. Those with concerns about SSDs completely replacing HDDs are missing that overall returns on invested capital govern how an industry satisfies its market's demand. Because HDD manufacturing is less capital intensive, HDDs will remain a significant part of the storage industry's evolution. More importantly, the current economic landscape means it is unlikely there will be enough SSD manufacturing capacity to satisfy all the demand. This bodes well for pricing of any type of storage.STX Transitioning Away from the PC Market to Take Advantage of These TrendsThe slowing down of PC sales has hurt sales of all the storage device manufactures. For the purpose of this analysis, the focus will be on the last independent storage device manufacturer, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX). STX's principal product is the HDD, and has recently started to manufacture SSDs. Seagate's independence allows management to use the best and least expensive SSD components and blend their strengths with HDDs to meet unique client demands.Declining PC Sales Hurt Revenue GrowthThe downdraft in PC sales has been made more severe by SSDs instead of HDDs in PCs and laptops. Since such a large portion of STX revenues currently come from the PC market (listed as ""client compute"" in table 2), the company's sales growth has been flat for the last four years.Table 2: Revenue drivers, broken down by HDD units sold to the various market segments.HDDs Continue to ImproveBeyond the headwind of losing PC market share, the revenue per unit of storage sold has been declining as well. This trend can be understood by looking at STX's revenue per unit of storage (exabyte) shipped. What has prevented STX's overall revenues from massively declining is the fact that HDD efficiency (i.e. capacity, or exabytes per HDD) has outpaced the declining price per exabyte (figure 3).Figure 3: Seagate's historical exabytes shipped growth, revenue per exabyte shipped growth, and the sum of the two.As can be seen, for all but one of the last four years, the rate of growth in exabytes shipped by Seagate is greater than the decrease in revenues per exabyte shipped. This combination of trends, and that demand for data storage continues to increase exponentially, has allowed STX to maintain its overall level of sales. Going forward, Seagate's management believes it can increase its exabytes shipped by 15% to 30% per year. Meanwhile, data creation and storage is increasing at a 40% compounded annualized growth rate.Analytical ApproachOur analytical approach determines the levels of sustainable cash flow a business is likely to produce. This distribution is then compared to today's stock price in order to understand the likelihood of that price being sustained. To start this process, we manually build a company's balance sheet and income statement with data from the past five years. These data are used to develop a set of operational metrics (value drivers) and to calculate their historical variance.The value drivers (historical averages unless otherwise specified) and their respective standard deviations are then put into a Monte Carlo simulation in order to generate a distribution of potential sustainable levels of free cash flow per share. The final step is to compare this distribution to the company's current share price and determine the likely direction of future price movements.This methodology allows us to identify situations in which the market's subjective expectations diverge significantly from historical norms and provides guidance as to the likely direction of the stock price. The following table, table 3, shows STX's historical operations.Table 3: Operational metrics for the last five fiscal years for Seagate. Shows expenses and EBITDA as a percentage of revenues, year to year.In order to calculate the range of possible levels of sustainable free cash flow, we used a 10-year discounted cash flow model. The levels of sustainable free cash flow are calculated using an EBITDA margin of 21%, 0% revenue growth, and a constant long-term asset turnover rate. These averages are varied by their historical standard deviations through 10,000 Monte Carlo simulation trials. The results of the analysis are shown in figure 4.Figure 4: Results of the Monte Carlo simulation on the implied share price of Seagate.In is important for the reader to realize that each average used in the simulation is varied independently for each year in the 10-year sustainable discounted cash flow model. As a result, the numbers on either side of the distribution incorporate the worst (left-side) and best (right-side) case scenario for Seagate. $49 per share in cash is the mid-point of what is sustainable, given the baseline averages. From the point of the stock price, over 90% of the probable sustainable free cash flow levels lie above $32 per share. So for the stock price to be sustained at $34.62, the business has to permanently deteriorate across all of its metrics. In the face of a growing demand, that seems unlikely. As a result, Seagate's stock is likely undervalued.ConclusionGiven its poor return profile, SSD component manufacturers will not have the incentives to invest in the significant surplus capacity required to meet future demand. Due to this, and paired with the slowdown in SSD capacity improvements according to Moore's law, SSD component pricing will have to improve for makers to get better returns. This means that Seagate, as the last independent HDD manufacturer, is in a strong competitive position and HDDs will likely continue to be used for the foreseeable future. At current price levels, and assuming no improvement in industry fundamentals, STX's stock appears to offer a significant upside opportunity. Should industry fundamentals improve as overall demand increases, even more upside is likely.[1] ROIC = Margin x Assets/Sales.[2] There are other SSD manufacturers, such as Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), but they are excluded from this table because they produce many other products that skew their ROICs in a direction not representative of an ""SSD-only"" business.[3] Total net change in PPE for SNDK, MU and INTC combined over last 10 years is approx. $100B.[4] Western Digital, an HDD maker, just acquired SanDisk, an SSD maker, for $19 billion, funding it almost entirely with new debt."
3929406,69695,2016-02-25T11:05:56-05:00,"The personal computer just suffered its worst decline ever in 2015. That has caused Seagate's shares to lose nearly half their value in the past year.But investors who are panic selling are missing the fact that STX continues to build its non-PC-related business.Plus, the company continues to generate enough free cash flow to reduce its share count and pay its dividend. For these reasons, I'm not tempted to sell Seagate.","As a manufacturer of disk drives and storage products, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is highly dependent on the personal computer industry. Unfortunately, the PC is eroding at a rapid pace. In fact, tech industry research firm IDC found that PC shipments suffered their biggest decline ever last year.As a result, this has hit Seagate particularly hard. Its shares are down 14% just since the beginning of 2016. Over the past one year, the stock is down a whopping 47%.The good news is that Seagate's stock is incredibly cheap on a valuation basis. And its $2.52 per share annual dividend yields 8% at these levels. Seagate is being punished because of fears over the PC, but the company is not getting any credit at all for its moves to expand its business focus beyond the PC. Therefore, I'm not selling my shares, even in a brutal climate for the PC.The Post-PC World for SeagateIDC found that global PC shipments totaled just 276.2 million units in 2015, a 10.4% year-over-year decline, from the 308.3 million recorded in 2014. Last year was the first year in which shipments fell below 300 million since 2008. The key contributors were slowing demand for PCs and laptops in emerging markets like China, where economic growth stalled last year. In addition, demand for PCs in general has tapered off in recent years, as a greater share of computing functions is now being done on smartphones and tablets.Normally, this would make for an automatic sell rating for Seagate, and if this were a few years ago, I wouldn't be nearly as bullish. But the reason I'm content to hold this stock is because the company has a plan to branch out from the PC, and it has made considerable progress in this initiative. For example, consider that in fiscal 2010 STX earned 37% of its total revenue from the cloud and new storage applications. On last quarter's conference call, Seagate's CEO said that the company's exposure to the traditional PC client market is lessening over time, and now represents less than 35% of total revenue.This percentage is likely to continue declining over time, as Seagate develops new cloud-based products either organically or through acquisition. The company still has $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents, which it can utilize for M&A if it chooses to. It has already done this to some degree, including the acquisition of Dot Hill Systems for $645 million last year.Plenty of Free Cash Flow to Go AroundTo be sure, Seagate does need a supportive PC environment as that area still represents a significant portion of the business. Its revenue declined 21% over the first half of the fiscal year. But the company continues to generate huge amounts of free cash flow, even while PC sales are deteriorating rapidly. That's because it has a very lean operating structure and does not need to spend much on capital expenditures from year to year. This leaves it free to use its massive free cash flow to buy back shares and pay hefty dividends.Despite the brutal performance of the PC, Seagate generated $1.2 billion in operating cash flow in the first two quarters of the fiscal year, and $860 million in free cash flow in that time. Its free cash flow represented 14% of its revenue over that period. The company uses a great deal of cash to effectively buy back shares, which has significantly reduced its diluted share count in recent periods. Last quarter, the company ended with 301 million diluted shares outstanding. At the same point two years ago, there were 346 million shares outstanding. That is a 13% reduction in its diluted share count in two years' time.And Seagate pays a dividend, which cost the company $351 million over the first two quarters. That means its dividend payout ratio is just 40% of free cash flow. There is a big cushion for STX to continue paying its dividend, which is a margin of safety for the sustainability of the distribution.I'm Not Selling Seagate Anytime SoonJudging by Seagate's poor stock price performance, it's clear the market is highly concerned about the company's reliance on hard drives and the PC. But STX doesn't need a boom in PCs to do well; even a modest recovery from here will benefit the company greatly, and its expansion into higher-growth areas will help as well.In the meantime, the stock seems far too cheap. Shares trade for 8 times forward earnings and the stock yields 8%. This seems like a classic case of market negativity gone too far, so I'll be holding onto my shares and am happy to reinvest that huge dividend at lower prices.Disclaimer: This article represents the opinion of the author, who is not a licensed financial advisor.

3970222,74295,2016-05-02T12:03:05-04:00,"Seagate reported Q3 earnings Friday and the results pushed the stock down nearly 20%.Shares now have a forward dividend yield of 11.5%.That yield may look scrumptious, but don't bite.","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) reported Q3 earnings Friday and the results were below expectations. Considering expectations were already at rock bottom in light of the company's Q3 warning it issued on April 13th, the report is especially disappointing. After the warning, STX shares lost about 20% of their value, and after this earnings report, STX shares again lost nearly 20% of their value.STX data by YChartsAll of these declines have brought STX down to a price range the stock hasn't seen since the beginning of 2012. Looking at Seagate's financials, it is not difficult to see why the stock has taken such a beating. Revenue for Q3 was $2.6 billion, which is a 21% year-over-year (""YoY"") decline from Q3 2015. Assuming Seagate matches its Q4 guidance and earns revenue of $2.3 billion, that would be full-year 2016 revenue of $10.8 billion. That equates to a YoY decline in annual revenue of 21%. For that kind of revenue deterioration in just one year, I think STX deserved the pummeling it got.Anyone who follows Seagate knows why revenue is dropping off so steeply: PC demand is still weak and falling, and hard disk drives are being cannibalized by solid state drives. While Seagate Technology has sat on its hands as its primary market deteriorates, its main competitor Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) went out and bought flash memory manufacturer SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) to lessen Western's dependence on the declining HDD market.At Friday's closing price of $21.77, STX now has a forward dividend yield of 11.5% or $2.52 a share. That may sound sweet, but do not bite on this yield trap. There are no indications that Seagate can halt its revenue declines and maintain the dividend payments it currently distributes. The only question that remains is not ""if"" Seagate will cut its dividend, but ""when."" In Q3, the company recorded free cash flow of just $110 million, per the conference call, and paid out dividends of $188 million. That's a shortfall of $78 million that will be taken out of Seagate's sizeable $1.2 billion cash pile. Additionally, Seagate spent just $95 million on capital expenditures in Q3.All of these data points point to management's intent to just tread water until the PC market bottoms. If it bottoms. Seagate's passive approach contrasts with Western Digital's, and I think that the risk of the PC market continuing to decline is fairly likely. If this scenario occurs, Seagate will find itself flailing for cash flow to pay its unitholders, while its cash pile shrinks further and further.The dividend is unsustainable and investors who buy into STX thinking that the yield is too juicy to pass up will likely be badly burned. Either Seagate won't slash or eliminate the dividend and it will gradually eat into its remaining cash or it will cut the dividend, leaving investors dividend-less and growthless. Either way, a long position doesn't look promising or appealing at all right now.Before I even consider a long position in STX, I think management must cut the dividend and use its resources to make a drastic move to reorient the company. Otherwise, the future looks very dim for Seagate Technology.My question to you, the reader, is:What do you think about Seagate's dividend? Should management cut it, eliminate it altogether, or leave it?

3965310,25265,2016-04-14T13:17:04-04:00,Seagate pre-announced its fiscal third quarter results last night and they were lousy.There are zero reasons to be bullish Seagate and many reasons to be bearish.Any investor thinking the dividend is safe is wrong. I suggest selling now before the cut comes.,"Last night Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) preannounced its fiscal third quarter results. They were, in a word, awful. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $2.6B versus guidance of $2.7B. The $2.7B is down from previous street expectations of $2.8B just 90 days ago. $2.6B in Q3 revenues represent a 21.9% decline on a year-over-year basis, which is an acceleration from the Q2 decline of 19.2%. Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 23% versus guidance for 25.6% and previous margin of 24.8%. Total drives sold fell to 39M units, down a whopping 15% from the previous quarter. The total addressable market or TAM for HDDs is declining at an alarming rate. Shares are crashing so far this morning, down 18% at the moment.What's Happening?Seagate is experiencing weakness across its product portfolio. In the press release, it cited reduced demand for mission critical HDD enterprise products, storage arrays, SSDs and client desktop and notebook drives. We knew client would be weak, but the weakness in mission critical enterprise drives is particularly concerning for the bulls as enterprise is always what they point to as the savior for the company. The fact of the matter is that SSDs are coming for the enterprise business quicker than most expected. When storage array makers EMC (EMC), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) report later this earnings season, I expect them to report large increases in all-flash arrays (70-100%) and modest declines in traditional HDD storage arrays as this has been the pattern in recent quarters. Also concerning for the bulls was the weakness the company pointed to in its silicon products, aka SSDs. As I have stated before, competition in enterprise SSDs is intense, and without its own silicon Seagate is at a pricing disadvantage. Anyone thinking SSDs will save Seagate will likely end up being sorely disappointed.The main takeaway from these results should be the following. First, Seagate has very poor visibility into demand for its products. This is very concerning. The company's ability to accurately forecast demand for HDDs is impaired due in large part to disruptive technology, slow global growth and the strong US dollar. The inability to accurately forecast demand is a bad sign and means that the company will have a difficult time managing its expense base. It also means that guidance should not be relied upon. That leads me to my second takeaway: margins will remain under pressure. We saw the drop in gross margin in Q3 down to 23%, well below the company's expectation for 25.6% and the lowest since Q1 FY2012. The company has not been able to cut capacity as fast as sales are declining. In addition, enterprise drives carry the highest margin. The weakness seen in enterprise in Q3 is very disconcerting for the bulls. A low 20% gross margin will put added pressure on cash flow, which will quickly call the dividend into question.I continue to believe the bulls have been very shortsighted in their analysis of this company. The high-level argument that the cloud will power the company's earnings for many years to come does not hold up to rigorous scrutiny. If you take away a majority of the client business (losses to SSDs, tablets, mobile-only consumers, etc.) there is no way that the enterprise and other ancillary businesses can support the current capital structure and the current dividend payout, especially considering the weakness we are now seeing in enterprise. Free cash flow has already declined from $1.9B in FY2015 to what could be below $1B in FY2016 ($1.1B LTM). There is no reason to expect these declines will abate anytime soon given the topline and margin pressure we are seeing. The current dividend costs the company $750M annually. If the current trend continues into FY2017, I would expect FCF to fall to near the level of the dividend payout next year. I know many investors are enamored with the current yield, but that is clearly not reason enough to own the stock. Today's drop alone wipes out more than two years of dividend payments. Cash flows are declining and there is little the company can do to stop it. Buybacks will all but stop if this continues. Soon the dividend will be called into question as free cash flow continues to decline. The company has run the cash balance down to near the minimum level it needs to run the business ($1B has been what the CFO has said in the past). Taking on additional debt to fund the dividend and buybacks is out of the question as leverage ratios have already increased due to declines in EBITDA and the interest rate would be exorbitant given the revenue and margin pressures. The stock absolutely does not deserve its current earnings multiple of nearly 12x. Given the rapid decline in the topline and complete lack of visibility into sales, I think 8x would be a generous multiple. The street's estimates for FY2017 are currently $3.26/share, but clearly those estimates are coming down. I do not see a path to 2017 EPS that is any higher than FY2016, which should be ~$2.40/share, possibly lower. If you use that number and an 8x multiple fair value for STX shares is $19.20. So even after today's drop the shares are not a bargain.The sell-side is weighing in this morning as well. So far I have seen Morgan Stanley cut its price target to $23. It noted that this is the first sign of weakness in the mission critical enterprise HDD business. This accounts for ~25% of Seagate's profits. With OEMs moving to SSDs it believes the weakness will persist. Citi also cut its PT to $22 and reiterated its Sell rating. They believe the main reason for the gross margin miss was lack of visibility into sales. UBS also cut its PT to $22.Once again I would implore everyone that owns Seagate for the current yield to move on to something more stable. Flash technology is being adopted at an increasing rate. Any tailwinds from the cloud are dissipating as more and more enterprise storage is moving to flash. Flash need not reach cost parody with HDDs for adoption to really spike - the performance improvements are reason enough for many to make the switch. The rest of Seagate's businesses are experiencing significant headwinds that are unlikely to dissipate anytime soon. I see no reason to have any confidence in a company experiencing 20% topline declines and shrinking margins. Revenues will continue to drop and margins could settle back to pre-industry consolidation levels in the high teens. In that scenario, the dividend absolutely will get cut. Don't wait for that to happen. Head to the exits now."
3848126,89566,2016-02-29T13:16:08-05:00,Seagate is over-earning and margins will compress.Management will need to decide between cutting buybacks or cutting the dividend.Share buybacks have supported the price over the past few years.,"Investment Overview/BackgroundSeagate (NASDAQ:STX) is a cyclical value trap disguised as a cost-competitive, dividend growing company. Investors believe that the hard disk drive (HDD) market has oligopolistic characteristics. Things do look good, on a backwards looking basis. Seagate has seen revenues increase since 2011, margins have improved, the company initiated a dividend, and data storage is expected to increase at staggering compound annual growth rates. As a result, Seagate's earnings multiple implies the business is no longer cyclical, nor is it subject to technological disruption.Much of this premium valuation was the result of industry consolidation and floods in Thailand that took out a significant amount of capacity of HDD production. Seagate was able to take advantage of the situation, which saw the price of 3.5 inch desktop drives climb more than 35% in the year after the floods. At the same time, Seagate acquired Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) HDD business just a few months after the flood, further limiting competition. Those shortages are a thing of the past and Seagate now faces competition from not only Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), but a number of SSD manufacturers like Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel, the 800-pound gorilla in technology, is aggressively pursuing new memory technologies, further weakening Seagate's current advantage.Looking back, Seagate enjoyed a multi-year run that is anomalous compared to the 40+ year history of computer memory manufacturers. Seagate has almost entirely missed the SSD growth curve and currently has little exposure to the technology that is most assuredly going to replace HDDs in a number of applications. This thesis does not predict the demise of Seagate, simply the re-rating of a company that is being valued as though it is not cyclical. I believe that Seagate is worth no more than $20 per share after factoring in price declines, limitations to HDD technology, and a valuation that factors in the cyclical nature of the business.The Road to an OligopolyThe history of computer memory manufacturers is littered with rapid technological change. More than 90 HDD manufacturers have operated and those who did not merge with other players out of necessity eventually exited the business or went bankrupt. To sum the industry up: very capital intensive, rapid technological change, and returns that often lag costs of capital.Gradually, the industry consolidated to three manufacturers in the world: Seagate, Western Digital and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). The graphic below shows industry consolidation. Seagate controls about 40% of the market, Western Digital controls 43.6%, and Toshiba controls the rest.Graphic 1. HDD Consolidation. Source: WikipediaA competitive landscape with three players should be rational. Assuming all the technology is similar, and rates of technological improvement remain steady, these companies should enjoy some pricing power and profits should be abundant. It is a simple explanation that rarely, if ever, passes for truth in real life. A recent example of this is the DRAM industry, which was supposed to be an oligopoly with pricing power. That thesis went out the window once Samsung had a technological edge and decided to gun for market share. SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) and Micron are now fighting to catch up with lower profits and increased capital investments.Hard disk drive manufacturers were able to escape this for a few short years. When HDD facilities were flooded in 2011, the final wave of consolidation took place and manufacturers remained rational for the next few years. SSDs were too expensive to replace HDDs in most applications and thus HDD manufacturers had no reason to cut prices outside of the normal cost curve decline that exists in most technology segments. The average selling price of Western Digital HDDs can be seen in the Chart below.Chart 1. Western Digital HDD ASP. Source: Company Financial FilingsWith only an occasional blip here or there, HDD ASPs have remained remarkably steady. There has been no reason for change and thus the desired status quo was able to thrive. Investors have been lulled into complacency and forgotten the previous 40 years of rapid technological change, obsolescence, and generally poor returns. There is a belief that HDDs only compete against HDDs and that SSDs are too expensive for all but a few performance based applications. The bull thesis is predicated on stable margins and stable markets. Indeed, the past few years have been remarkably steady for Seagate. The chart below shows the last 10 years' revenues, free cash flow, and margins as a percentage of revenues for Seagate.Chart 2. Seagate Historical Financials FY 2005-2015. Source: Seagate SEC filingsThe chart above shows stability from 2012-2015 for both revenue and gross margin. If this is a new paradigm then these figures will continue to be stable for years to come. I believe that the floods created a temporary dislocation where Seagate and Western Digital enjoyed a three-year period that was aided by a recovery in the world's economy, complete consolidation in the HDD industry, and a cost advantage over other technologies, namely SSD. This change to Seagate's margins can be seen in the table below.Table 1. Change in Seagate Profitability. Source: Dichotomy's CalculationsSeagate was able to keep ASP high, as the HDD market was rational and controlled with pricing and investment. Thus, the cost curve decline that made manufacturing cheaper was not passed on to the end consumer. In order to buy the bull thesis, an investor first needs to believe that the above-average profits can be sustained for an extended period of time.Free cash flow margin, as a percentage of revenues, is already starting to decline due to increases in product development spend and marketing spend. Given the increased complexity of storage growth sectors, like enterprise, neither development nor marketing spend is expected to decline soon. I side with Jeremy Grantham, who stated that profit margins are the most mean-reverting series in finance. Looking at the PC and Enterprise markets should give investors an idea of how these margins will revert back to historical levels.Enterprise and PC MarketsThere is a widely held belief that personal computer (PC) HDD shipments will decline over time, as PC sales decline. On the flipside, it is believed that enterprise shipments will grow quickly and the associated gain in enterprise HDD sales will outpace any decline associated with PC HDD. Seagate's management is quick to jump on this thesis and routinely cites a 35% CAGR in enterprise for the next few years. This is a broad statement that does not factor in changes to technology or preference for alternative memory types, like SSD. HDDs are not the technology of tomorrow and oversimplification of the growth ignores the increasing importance of performance and the shift to SSDs in the enterprise market.EMC believes that the enterprise storage market is undergoing a secular shift. David Goulden, EMC's CEO of Information Infrastructure highlights this in the Q2 2015 earnings call.The enterprise storage system of tomorrow is increasingly complex and the build depends on a number of factors. Looking one step down the supply chain, HDD investors should examine Nidec's (NJ) expectations. As a manufacturer of 80% of all HDD motors, Nidec has good insight to future demand. Even with the growth of the enterprise market, and continued explosion of data storage, Nidec believes that HDD shipments will decline at a low single-digit percentage until at least 2018. This data can be seen in the chart on the next page. Between EMC's public comments and Nidec's public information, it is clear that the HDD market is in perpetual decline, enterprise or no enterprise market.This decline is occurring despite amazing growth in overall data usage. Some of this is due to expanding memory capacity in HDDs, which limits the number of HDD units being sold. The main reason for this decline is a dramatic increase in SSD capacity and a dramatic decrease in SSD price.Chart 1. Nidec Estimates. Source: Nidec Sept 30, 2015 Investor Presentation, released Oct 22, 2015Solid State Drives and Emerging TechnologyThis segment will explore some of the emerging technology and compare it to what HDD manufacturers have in the pipeline. It is not meant to be an exhaustive research source, but is here to highlight the uphill battle Seagate faces.At the forefront of new storage technology is rapidly improving solid state drives. When compared to HDD, SSD is significantly more expensive, but that is changing for two reasons. The first is the decrease in SSD prices due to rapid technological innovation. The second reason is HDD's lack of innovation. Cost parity between SSD and HDD is expected in 2016. The picture on the next page shows the costs as of Q2 2015.David Floyer's quote above should carry some credibility given his years of experience at EMC (EMC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and IDC (IDC).Picture 1. Storage Costs for Enterprise. Source: Storagenewsletter.comGiven the rapidly declining costs of flash, it is amazing that Seagate has decided to ignore flash and instead focus on share buybacks. Even ignoring the SSD missteps, the outlook for HDD is no better and there has been a distinct lack of innovation from Seagate. Right now, the standard type of hard drive recording is Perpendicular Magnetic Recording (PMR), which has been the standard format since 2005. Seagate has gotten costs down and expanded memory to 8 terabyte (TB) per drive. Unfortunately, Western Digital's HGST division released a helium-filled 10 TB drive more than a month ahead of Seagate.Both Western Digital and Seagate have increased R&D spend, a move that I believe is necessary and permanent. Investors have been lulled into margin complacency due to a period of underinvestment. HDDs have hit a wall with current technology and both Seagate and Western Digital are racing to deploy Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) HDDs soon. HAMR technology is considered the next step for HDDs, but getting HAMR HDDs to market has proved incredibly difficult. In 2014, Western Digital predicted 30-50 TB HAMR drives by 2017. That estimate has now been pushed out to 2020. It is no wonder that R&D spend has continued to increase at both Seagate and Western Digital, a trend that can be seen below.Chart 2. R&D Spend as a Percentage of Revenue Seagate and Western Digital. Source: Company FilingsThe gap that exists between Western Digital and Seagate since 2012 is part of the reason earnings, and cash flow, have looked so good at Seagate - Seagate under-spent on R&D and instead resorted to buybacks as the preferred capital allocation method. This is not sustainable. Even if we examine other memory companies, it is likely that Seagate has under-spent on critical R&D. Since 2008, Micron's R&D, as a percentage of revenues, has averaged more than 10%. The chart above shows that Seagate has never even reached 10%. I believe that R&D will increase as Seagate plays catch up and attempts to build-out their nascent SSD division. With revenues likely declining, increased R&D spend will have a significant impact on earnings and cash flow.Western Digital has done a few things differently. First, as can be seen in Chart 2, R&D spend has picked up since 2010. Second, Western Digital acquired SanDisk (SNDK) on October 21, 2015. The acquisition was executed to both expand the addressable market and ""expand its participation in higher-growth segments."" In other words, Western Digital wanted to avoid being a HDD-only vendor. With the acquisition of SanDisk, Western Digital has an estimated 25% market share of the SSD space.Western Digital has been very aggressive about pursuing SSD companies. There is a clear trend to gain market share in the enterprise SSD space as Western Digital has acquired sTEC and Virident Systems. With SanDisk out of the market, there are no options for Seagate to get into SSD in a quick manner. The build vs. buy argument is now simply a build argument, as there is no one left to buy. Seagate has very little chance of getting into SSDs at this stage in the game. From an enterprise customer's perspective, do you buy separate equipment, or do you go to a company like Western Digital that has a number of different memory solutions and a clear focus on the enterprise segment?Outside of SSDs, there are a number of emerging technologies that could provide expanded memory capabilities (and capacity), further weakening Seagate's market share. Some memory technologies like HAMR will attempt to extend the life of HDD. Other technologies, like MRAM, are theorized to be the universal memory, but are years away from any sort of commercial development.One type of memory that could have an impact on SSDs and HDDs is Intel/Micron's 3D XPoint (XPoint). XPoint is a new type of memory that is faster than NAND, has higher density than conventional memory, and lower power consumption than DRAM. When released in mid-2016, XPoint is expected to cost somewhere between NAND and DRAM. While the manufacturing and materials are highly guarded, patent analysis suggests XPoint is a phase change memory.What is important to consider about XPoint is not what the memory is or the cost point right now. What is important is that Intel is behind it. Intel is the 800lb gorilla in the tech space and throws incredibly large amounts of money towards R&D. The R&D spend on memory based projects should concern old technology companies like Seagate. The more money the entire ecosystem is spending on new memory types (whether it is on improving SSD or funding new memory types like XPoint), the more likely a large breakthrough will occur. Seagate does not deserve a premium valuation (a valuation roughly in-line with Intel's) given the eroding market share and increased competition.ValuationI believe that Seagate bulls have extrapolated the recent results and profitability into the future, which sets up Seagate shares for a rerating lower. During 2015, I calculate that Seagate generated more than $4 per share in free cash flow. Compared to a current price of $32.54, this implies a P/FCF ratio of 8x. If HDD sales will rise and if margins will stabilize at current rates, Seagate is likely undervalued. After all, who wouldn't pay at least 10x for a business that is growing both the top line and the bottom line?Seagate is not growing the top line and their bottom line will soon come under pressure as SSD expands into HDD markets and gains market share. As HDDs compete with SSDs, prices will compress and margins will follow, eventually hitting their long-term averages.My revenue estimates for each division can be found in the table below. Estimates for free cash flow generation can be found in Table 3. It should be noted that my margin expectations are no doomsday scenario and are well above historical averages. As a reference point, if 2018 gross margin comes in at historical averages, FCF/share would be $1.23/share. I have also factored in share buybacks to all my figures.Table 2. Revenue Estimates. Source: Company Filings, Dichotomy CalculationsA discounted cash flow, using a 10% discount rate and a 10x value to 2019 FCF/share figures (a high multiple considering the inherent cyclical nature) from Table 3 gets us to a fair value of $17.28. We can also think about this with straight multiples. If you believe the business is a slow decliner, an 8x FCF/share multiple seems appropriate, if not overly conservative for shorts. Compared to my 2017 FCF/share target of $2.07, this implies a 2017 price target of $16.56.Finally, as far as valuation is concerned, we can assign an EBITDA multiple to the enterprise. I estimate that 2017 EBITDA will come in at $1,373 million. A generous 6.5x multiple and the assumption that all the cash on the balance sheet is free (given the net working capital drag Seagate has had over the past 10 years, this seems very optimistic) we arrive at an implied equity value of $6.70 billion. Assuming 296 million shares outstanding (to account for buybacks), we get to a fair price of $22.65/share.Table 3. Expectations for Seagate 2016-2018. Source: Company Filings and Dichotomy CalculationsBottom Line: I believe Seagate's fair value is between $16-$22 per share. Compared to a current price of $32.54 this works out to 50-32% downside.Ultimately, I believe that the dividend is in danger and management will need to stretch the balance sheet to fund the dividend and stock buybacks. Currently, the dividend is $0.63 per quarter, per share. As can be seen in Table 3, FCF/share is expected to decline below this level in 2016 and will likely never exceed that. Seagate will be left with a decision to keep the dividend or eliminate share buybacks. Given the shareholder base and their expectation for continued dividends, I believe buybacks will be eliminated first. The share price support that buybacks have provided over the past three years cannot be understated. The chart below shows buybacks and my estimates for the percentage of daily volume buybacks were a part of.Chart 4. Seagate Buybacks. Source: Dichotomy Calculations and Seagate FilingsOver the past two years, Seagate buybacks have made up 3.5% of average volume. If a price agnostic purchaser goes away, who buys the shares on the margin?Finally, investors that are looking at earnings should note that Seagate has experienced a one-time boost to earnings from a settlement with Western Digital. During the fiscal year ending July 3, 2015, Seagate booked a $620 million gain on arbitration award. While there is nothing wrong about this accounting treatment, investors need to understand that the TTM earnings are not indicative of the earnings power on an ongoing basis.BorrowThis is a large and liquid short. According to Interactive Brokers, borrow costs are less than 0.7% and there are more than 5.9 million shares available to borrow. Daily volume averages more than 5 million shares per day. Short sellers of all sizes will have no problem borrowing shares of Seagate and covering when a fair value is achieved.RisksConclusionSeagate is stuck with a complacent investor base. Due to black swan-like events, Seagate has enjoyed historically high margins for several years. These margins are not sustainable and will gradually compress back to long-term averages. As other technologies start to eat away at HDD market share, Seagate will see margins compress and FCF/share erode.Investors today are valuing Seagate at more than 13x 2016's FCF. A multiple like this implies that investors do not believe Seagate is cyclical and they do not think that margins will mean revert. If margins trend down to their long-term averages and SSD continues to eat away market share, Seagate is worth a lot less than the market's current value of $32.54. I believe a fair value of Seagate is less than $18 per share, providing investors with more than 45% downside. Further downside exists with poor capital allocation, delays in new HDD technologies, or a cost war with SSDs.Disclaimer: This research report expresses our opinions.

Meanwhile, STX's stock has climbed 14.5% since my article was published. However, in my opinion, the stock is still attractive.Since the beginning of the year, STX's stock is down 1.3% while the S&P 500 Index has decreased 1.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has lost 5.2%.

According to some investors, the hard disk drive is becoming obsolete, and, therefore, Seagate's growth prospects are low. On the recent quarter conference call, CEO Luczo repeated his confidence in the HDD business saying that from every source of data that we have, we still have 95% to 98% of the bits ultimately being stored on a disk drive or more. Seagate shipped 45.9 million HDDs in the last quarter increasing its market share to 41.7%, higher than its full-year market share of 40.6%. In my view, Seagate is poised to achieve growth by its recent efforts to diversify its portfolio. The company is gaining good traction on building its flash portfolio, and growth in adjacent markets is offsetting hard disk drive headwinds.As such, on March 08, Seagate unveiled a production-ready unit of the fastest single solid-state drive (SSD) demonstrated to date, with throughput performance of 10 gigabytes per second. The early unit meets Open Compute Project specifications, making it ideal for hyperscale data centers looking to adopt the fastest flash technology with the latest and most sustainable standards. According to the company, the 10GB/s unit, which is expected to be released this summer, is more than 4GB/s faster than the previous fastest-industry SSD on the market. It also meets the OCP storage specifications being driven by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which will help reduce the power and cost burdens traditionally associated with operating at this level of performance. Brett Pemble, Seagate's general manager and vice president of SSD Products explained:Seagate has been paying dividends since 2003, but had stopped its payments in 2009 and 2010. On October 21, Seagate increased its quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.63 per common share. The forward annual dividend yield is very high at 6.97%, and the payout ratio is at 113%. The current yield is historically high, which indicates that the stock is undervalued, according to some dividend assessment theories. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was very high at 33.6%, and over the past five years was extremely high at 83.7%. Despite the high payout ratio, I believe that the high dividend is sustainable since CEO Luczo said that there has been no change in the company's capital allocation policy and its dividend payout of $188 million a quarter works comfortably within its cash flow generation forecast.STX Dividend data by YChartsSTX Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YChartsDuring the last quarter, the company generated approximately $382 million in operating cash flow, paid cash dividends of $188 million and repurchased approximately 2.9 million ordinary shares for $107 million.

3883366,25265,2016-02-10T12:12:23-05:00,"Seagate reported better-than-expected December quarter results, but revenue guidance for the March quarter widely missed estimates.The company is on a path to obsolesce and there is little that can be done to stop it.Any rallies in the stock should be sold as secular headwinds will be too much to overcome.","For the December quarter Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) reported solid results of $2.986B in revenue and $0.82 in adjusted EPS vs. expectations for $2.942B and $0.71, respectively. The beat was mainly the result of increased sales of high capacity enterprise drives accompanied by significant operating expense reductions, partially offset by continued weakness in client and gaming drives. As a result of shutting in capacity and accelerated cost savings due to the full integration of Samsung's HDD business Seagate bought back in 2011, operating expenses were down 17% year-over-year. That adds up to a near-term beat. However, the long-term trend toward obsolesce continues. Strength in shares should continue to be sold by investors. Here are the reasons why:Unit Shipments Continue their Steady Slide LowerSource: earnings supplemental disclosuresThis has principally been driven by a decline in the client computing business. PC Unit HDD shipments are down 10.7M over this period for Seagate. While global macro weakness and the strong dollar have contributed to some of the weakness in overall PC sales, the secular headwinds of increased mobile only computing and SSDs (particularly in notebook computers) will persist as NAND flash continues to fall in price. I expect unit shipments to continue to fall as NAND penetration into PCs continues unabated.While the company will point to the growth in capacity per drive and overall exabytes shipped, I would argue that the company is losing incremental margin by selling less drives at higher capacity points. We have seen the margin drop in recent quarters, particularly as capacity per drive has ramped up. The company blames the drop on a temporary market share loss in near-line high capacity drives, but until we see gross margin return to the 27-32% target range enjoyed by both Western Digital and Seagate over the past several years, we won't know for sure. I suspect flash competition is eroding that margin profile as well, as storage OEMs such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) and EMC (EMC) are touting price per gigabyte parody on all flash arrays for many applications (as a result of data compression).The Company's non-HDD Revenue Base is Too Small to Offset DeclinesSeagate breaks out its non-HDD revenue in its earnings supplement. Over the last 12 months, Seagate has generated ~$910M in revenue from these businesses, which include storage arrays, controller technology and flash products. This includes the newly acquired Dot Hill Systems (NASDAQ:HILL) storage array business that was annualizing at ~$250M in revenue prior to Seagate buying it in the December quarter. It is safe to assume the non-HDD business at Seagate is now annualizing at $1B+ in revenue. On the most recent earnings call, CEO Steve Luczo stated that this segment could grow double digits over the next few years. However, this revenue stream is dwarfed by the $11.2B in revenue from HDDs over the past 12 months. If HDD revenue continues to decline double digits annually, then double-digit revenue growth for a segment that only makes up 8 percent of total revenues is not going to stem the overall revenue decline. In addition, margins in this segment also are under pressure. The enterprise SSD market is crowded and becoming commoditized - similar to the client SSD market. With so many players, pricing is competitive and under pressure. Seagate also is at a pricing disadvantage having to source NAND from partners at a higher cost than it would if Seagate owned its own fabs.The Company's Leverage Position is ErodingFor several years now Seagate has used its free cash flow and additional leverage to return cash to shareholders. The company's current dividend yield is a very attractive 8.3%, which costs $750M/year. Since the beginning of FY2012, Seagate has repurchased stock totaling $8.1B, which is nearly all of the company's current market cap. This has reduced the share count from 419.5M to 296.4M over the same period. Nearly all repurchases over the last three years were at prices significantly higher than today's price. The green line is the number of shares repurchased (in millions) for that quarterly period.The problem going forward is that absent a significant turnaround in the HDD business, the company is unlikely to generate significant free- cash flow in excess of the dividend cost ($188M/quarter) to continue to repurchase sizable amounts of stock. The company has run its cash balance down to $1.26B as of December 31, thanks in part to the $630M cash purchase of Dot Hill. The CFO has previously stated that the company wants to keep a minimum of $1B in cash to run its business, so the current balance cannot be drawn down much more to buy back stock. The company already has a net debt position of $2.9B. With the deterioration in its business, the company should not want to take on additional debt, nor should the markets allow it to. So the company is handcuffed at this point from taking out any large chunks of shares.I did find the CEO's $6M stock purchase somewhat surprising last week. When is the last time you saw a CEO in Silicon Valley buy stock in the open market? Right, never. It never happens…ok maybe not never, but it is exceedingly rare. Shares are always given out for free! Some investors took the open market purchase as a good sign, but I view it as a bad sign. I believe it was an attempt to prop up the stock because the company no longer has the financial flexibility to do it through large stock repurchases. The CEO has been awarded many millions of shares over the years as part of his compensation and has sold well over $100M in stock over the past several years alone. In 2012 alone he sold 3.2M shares for likely proceeds of $80M. He subsequently sold more shares at much higher prices in 2014. I don't believe his recent purchases are that meaningful for him. Given the company's current financial state, I view the open market purchase as an attempt to prop up shares. It is a negative in my view.Topline Burn Continues at an Alarming RateDespite the topline beat in the December quarter, the topline continues to erode at a rapid rate. The revenue beat in the December quarter still saw revenues decline 19 percent year-over-year. Guidance for the March quarter came in well below consensus estimates at $2.7B. This would be another 18.7% decline year-over-year. Yet somehow the stock rallied hard on this news? I'm not sure why. The secular headwinds will continue. With 55% of unit shipments going into the client compute space, which is seeing HDD shipments declining at a rate of 29% year-over-year (due to declining PC says as well as NAND flash penetration), I fail to see how Seagate can stem the revenue declines anytime soon. Costs need to continue to come down to maintain margins. Even if Seagate is successful in maintaining margins, the absolute dollars of free cash flow will continue to shrink, putting pressure on the debt/EBITDA ratio and capital returns.Advancements in Flash Technology Continues UnabatedIntel and Micron are developing what they term ""a breakthrough in on-volatile memory technology."" Samsung is pushing full steam ahead with its own 3D NAND, as is SanDisk (SNDK), SK Hynix and Toshiba. All these breakthroughs and competitors will only serve to lower the cost of NAND - not to mention the performance improvements over mechanical spinning disks. This is a long-term secular headwind that will eventually run over Seagate. This is exactly why Western Digital made the only move it could to ensure long-term survivability - it bought the only flash players really available for purchase: SanDisk. SanDisk, with its Toshiba alliance, is broadly considered to be behind from a technological view with its 3D NAND offerings. But Western Digital really did not have a choice. It had to make a move and made the only one it really could. Only time will tell if this was a good move. Western Digital is taking on a lot of debt to finance the transaction.ConclusionsTo sum up, Seagate is on a path to obsolesce. There may be glimmers of hope along the way, but the stock should be sold on any rally. If the dollar weakens significantly vs. other major currencies, I can see that being good for PC sales as most of the components and operating system are priced in dollars. However, flash penetration will continue in the client space, particularly in laptops as the performance benefits are very meaningful. Eventually flash will come for enterprise near-line applications. It's already penetrating mission critical applications. HDDs will be left with just the budget (surveillance, DVRs, gaming systems, etc.) and cold storage applications. That won't be enough to support the current capital structure at Seagate.The balance sheet is concerning. The company will have a higher cost of capital when it needs to refinance that $800M tranche in 2018. Its bonds in the 8-12 year maturity range now trade between 70 and 80 cents on the dollar according to TRAC.With $4.1B in debt, $1.2B in cash, a dividend that costs $750M a year and free cash flow that could fall to $1.0-$1.2B in FY2016 (vs. $1.9B in FY2015), investors should be concerned. While I don't think this is the last call for HDDs, I do believe they will get run over by flash or some other technology not yet developed in the medium- to long-term. Unfortunately, the company is on the wrong side of history, and there is little it can do to save itself. I'd recommend selling or reducing exposure on any strength."

However, since the beginning of 2012, STX's stock has gained 92.6%. In this period, the S&P 500 Index has increased 49.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 67.5%. According to TipRanks, the average target price of the top analysts is at $37, up 17.1% from its February 5 close price; however, in my opinion, shares could go much higher.STX Daily ChartSTX Weekly ChartCharts: TradeStation Group, Inc.On January 29, Seagate reported its second quarter fiscal 2016 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by a big margin of $0.11 (15.5%). The company posted revenue of $2.99 billion in the period, also surpassing Street forecasts of $2.96 billion. Seagate showed earnings per share surprise in six of its last eight quarters, as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo FinanceSource: Fiscal Second Quarter 2016 Conference CallIn the report, Steve Luczo, Seagate's chairman and chief executive officer, said:In my view, the fact that the company was able to increase its gross margin to 25.6% from the previous quarter gross margin of 24.2% is encouraging. Gross margin benefited in the last quarter from good cost controls and improved market share in the 8TB segment of the capacity market. Seagate's enterprise units were up 4% quarter over quarter in a market that was likely flat, with Exabyte growth up 21% from the first quarter, highlighting a fundamental improvement in the highest capacity segment. During the post-release conference call, CEO Luczo said that the company still expects that its gross margins will be in its target range of 27% to 32% for the June quarter.Source: Fiscal Second Quarter 2016 Conference CallAlthough last quarter cash flow was lower than that of the previous one, it is quite impressive that despite the weakness in the PC market, Seagate has been able to generate strong cash flow and free cash flow in all its last ten quarters, as shown in the chart below. In fact, the company's trailing twelve months price to cash flow at 6.52 is the sixth lowest among all S&P 500 tech stocks.Source: Company's reportsThe 10 S&P 500 tech stocks with the lowest price to cash flow ratioSource: Portfolio123HDD accounts for about 90% of Seagate's revenues. In the conference call, CEO Luczo repeated his confidence in the HDD business saying that from every source of data that we have, we still have 95% to 98% of the bits ultimately being stored on a disk drive or more. Seagate shipped 45.9 million HDDs in the second quarter increasing its market share to 41.7%, higher than its full-year market share of 40.6%. HDD ASP of $59.42 was down 3% annually but rebounded in mid-single digits on a sequential basis as the mix swung away from client HDDs and towards enterprise. CEO Luczo was asked at the conference about his opinion that Toshiba will exit the HDD business, and he responded that he is much more towards the end that they are not going to be in this business in the next one to three years. Since Toshiba has about 16% market share in HDD, their exit from this market could be a positive development for Seagate, in my opinion.In my view, Seagate is poised to achieve growth by its recent efforts to diversify its portfolio. The company is gaining good traction on building its flash portfolio, and growth in adjacent markets is offsetting hard disk drive headwinds. Also, enterprise and data center are offering growth opportunities. According to the company, it is planning for its cloud storage systems and silicon business to exit the fiscal year 2016 at a revenue run rate of over $1 billion a year. This will position it for continued success and profitability in the fiscal year 2017, as several areas of these markets are projected to grow double digits over the next few years. Also, Seagate closed its acquisition of Dot Hill on October 6, and it has begun integrating the business into its Cloud Systems and Solution business, which should also contribute to growth.Seagate has been paying dividends since 2003 but had stopped its payments in 2009 and 2010. On October 21, Seagate increased its quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.63 per common share. The forward annual dividend yield is very high at 7.98%, and the payout ratio is at 50.5%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was very high at 33.6%, and over the past ten years was also high at 22.9%. In my opinion, the high dividend is sustainable. What's more, CEO Luczo said that there has been no change to the company's capital allocation policy, and its dividend payout of $188 million a quarter works comfortably within its cash flow generation forecast.STX Dividend data by YChartsDuring the second quarter, the company generated approximately $382 million in operating cash flow, paid cash dividends of $188 million and repurchased approximately 2.9 million ordinary shares for $107 million. There were 296 million ordinary shares issued and outstanding as of the end of the quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter.Not only the company is buying its shares, but also some executives are doing the same. Last week, CEO Luczo bought Seagate's shares for more than $6 million, and CSES Brace bought Seagate's shares for $145,500.ValuationConsidering its compelling valuation, STX's stock, in my opinion, is extremely undervalued.

3738626,22148,2015-12-07T14:03:57-05:00,"Seagate offers investors a solid dividend, but the excitement is with the buyback.Pricing pressure in the data storage sector is a constant that makes the stock volatile, providing for buying opportunities.The capital return plan offers a huge yield a bullish signal based on historical results. .","Like many large-cap tech stocks, 2015 hasn't been a banner year for Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX). The stock ended 2014 in the $60s and the action has been all downhill in 2015. In fact, the data storage stock has seen so much carnage that a key metric is finally issuing another buy signal.Seagate faces a highly competitive market with constant pressure on pricing as evidenced by the recent estimates from DRAMeXchange. Despite this fact and the company generating lower profits this year, Seagate recently raised the dividend by 17%. The new annual dividend of $2.52 offers an incredibly high 7.3% yield with the stock trading at $34.44.The market wasn't impressed by the dividend hike and has sent the stock lower since the announcement back in late October. Seagate though yields considerably higher when considering the gigantic stock buyback plan. For Q3, the data storage company spent an incredible $983 million to repurchase roughly 20 million shares. The number is rather impressive considering the market cap barely stretches past $10 billion now.Due to both the large stock buyback and dividend, the net payout yield currently sets at an incredible 24.4%. In essence, the company has returned nearly 25% of the market value to shareholders over the last 12 months. As the below chart shows, Seagate has a history over the last five years of signaling via the capital return program when the stock is cheap.STX data by YChartsThe company spent incredible amounts on capital returns in 2012 before the stock soared to over $65 in the next two years. The interesting part is that the buybacks dried up as the stock gained momentum throughout 2013 and 2014. Now that Seagate is down nearly 50% from the highs, the company is back buying stock like crazy.The only concern with the current strategy is the balance sheet. Seagate has $1.9 billion of cash to help enhance any capital return program and the company is cash flow positive, but the liability side of the balance sheet is a red flag.Seagate has long-term debt of $4.1 billion creating a net debt position of roughly $2.2 billion. The huge buyback during Q3 consumed roughly $550 million from the net cash position and benefited from a $450 million increase in accounts payable. A reversal in the accounts payable balance would hurt the cash position.The key takeaway from the net payout yield concept is that it takes emotion away from investing. Based purely on the yield, investors should load up on Seagate at multi-year lows. The signal worked previously and no indication exists that management is wrong this time either.The balance sheet is a potential problem with huge capital returns in the future, but the signal for now is bullish."
3827746,25265,2016-01-22T10:47:56-05:00,Toshiba is a distant third in market share for hard disk drives and has lower margins than Seagate and Western Digital.Toshiba is reeling from an accounting scandal that could see it completely exit from the HDD business in 2016.This could provide a temporary boost to both Seagate and Western Digital.Both stocks should be sold on any strength as secular headwinds become stronger every quarter.,"There are only three players in the hard disk drive (HDD) market: Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY). Using information provided by both Seagate and Western Digital in their quarterly reports and International Data Corporation, we can parse out market share for each company.Each company's market share has been pretty static for the past few years, +/- 1.5 percentage points. On a revenue basis, Toshiba only garnered 13.8% market share in Q3 2015 according to IDC data.It is no secret that Toshiba is reeling from a major accounting scandal this year that saw the CEO and several senior officials resign. Profits were overstated by $1.2B over a seven-year period. The company is forecasting a massive loss this year, has cancelled its dividend and is financing its operations by raising billions in debt. I looked into Toshiba's product line-up in HDDs - particularly its enterprise offerings. It pales in comparison to Western Digital and Seagate's offerings. It shows up in the operating performance. Here is a chart compiled by Bloomberg of data put out by IDC.Toshiba generates a majority of its HDD revenue from drives used in laptops (57% for the most recent reported quarter). Incidentally these drives have the lowest margin and are the most likely to be displaced by NAND flash drives. In the category that generates the highest margin for these companies, enterprise drives, Toshiba is woefully lacking a competitive line-up. It has just 8.5% market share by revenues.So then the question becomes - why should Toshiba even bother remaining a distant third in the HDD space given its financial woes and the rapid adoption of NAND flash? Let's consider the numbers. Toshiba generated $4.0B in revenue selling HDDs over the last 12 months. Given its lack of competitive enterprise offerings, its gross margin is in the low 20s at best. I'd ballpark it at 22%. I'll be generous and estimate that its EBITDA margin is 12% and net income margin is 4%. I used Western Digital's consistent performance as a guide. Toshiba is not likely as well managed, so my numbers are likely generous. That means Toshiba generated roughly $160M in net income in the last year by operating this business. Operating cash flow could be closer to $210M given non-cash charges. However we know there are capital expenditure requirements. I estimate them to be ~3.5% of revenues (in-line with peers). That puts free cash flow at a measly $70M/year - and likely dropping. That says nothing of the amount of debt this business carries.So that begs the question: Why even bother? HDDs are a sun-setting industry. Within 5-10 years most of demand will have shifted to NAND or some other technology not yet commercialized. The company's net income is likely to erode further in the coming years as sales decline and margins compress. Toshiba's business is not at sufficient scale and its product offerings are too limited to generate meaningful income for its parent company. Further investment to boost sales does not make financial sense given the above dynamics.I'm not the only one wondering whether Toshiba should continue in this business. This article goes into some detail about Toshiba's woes and considers what businesses could be divested. HDDs is on the list. But is there a natural buyer of the business? I cannot think of one. Other conglomerates, Samsung and Hitachi, sold their businesses to Seagate and Western Digital, respectively. They don't want to get back into the business. Anyone buying the business will put a large discount on the price given Toshiba's poor market position. Maybe a private equity vulture would pay a couple million for it. Maybe a Chinese buyer emerges because they want the technology. But again, this technology could be worthless within the next decade, so why bother? If Toshiba shops it around and finds no buyers it could just shut the whole thing down rather than continue to invest precious dollars into old technology.From a regulatory standpoint, I don't think Seagate or Western Digital would even try to make a run at the business. Anti-competitive watchdogs don't like mergers that result in a duopoly. But what can they do about one that just happens naturally? If no one buys the business from Toshiba it could just go away, which would leave only two standing. But of course Seagate and Western Digital don't just compete against themselves. NAND flash is taking more and more of the digital storage market share from these companies every quarter. A progressive take on the storage market by regulators would not foresee a problem with a duopoly in HDDs.So what would that mean for Seagate and Western Digital in the near-term if Toshiba quit the HDD market? Each would likely garner about half of Toshiba's $4B in annual revenues. Assuming a 10 percent net margin that could add another $200M in annual income for each. Maybe each gains some marginal pricing power in the near term and margins expand. Any rally in either Seagate or Western Digital should likely be sold though. Longer-term Seagate is not well positioned for the transition to flash. Western Digital is buying SanDisk but there are no guarantees that will work either. The company is taking on ~$16B in additional debt to finance the transaction. Market observers generally point to Micron and Samsung as being the best positioned in the NAND space for the next five years.So in conclusion, Toshiba's HDD business is in nomad's land. As Toshiba seeks to restructure its business to focus on the most promising technologies, it hardly seems as though HDDs would have a place anymore. With no natural buyer of a distant third in terms of market share in a sun setting industry, Toshiba could just completely shut down operations. This would give both Seagate and Western Digital a temporary boost. Any strength in the share price as a result of a Toshiba exit from the space is likely a good point to reduce exposure to this space. The technology is moving rapidly. Flash makers are willing to endure low margins and high capex in order to gain market share. Price wars are never good for profit maximizing firms. The long-term pressure on margins for HDDs will continue.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3575746,25265,2015-10-15T15:31:41-04:00,"Seagate pre-announced quarter results that fell well short of expectations.In particular, the company's non-GAAP gross margin fell below 27% for the first time since 2011 - a worrisome sign.Despite the large drop in shares today and the juicy dividend, shares should be avoided until the company can regain its footing in the enterprise market.","On Thursday morning, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) pre-announced some of its fiscal Q1 results to the market. It reported revenues of approximately $2.9B and a non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 24%. Previous guidance was for revenues of $2.9B to $3.1B and non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 27%. The miss in gross margin is particularly disturbing for Seagate stockholders as this marks the first time the gross margin has dipped below 27% since 2011 and the miss was large.Source: Company earnings press releases2011 was pre-industry consolidation - when margins hovered in the 18-20% range. The company blamed the miss on lower than expected demand for the company's 4TB and 6TB HDD nearline storage products. These enterprise quality drives are important for the overall gross margin because they are sold at higher price points and higher margins than the company average. The fact that the company fell short of its goal for these drives during the quarter is quite worrisome.So was this a demand issue that the whole industry should be worried about or was this an issue principally related to Seagate's execution during the quarter? The CEO's comments in the press release lead me to believe Seagate's product offerings have fallen short on performance versus rivals:This comment makes it seem as though Seagate's lineup in nearline storage drives was not up to par with its competitors, mainly Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). What's even more concerning is that the company does not expect to be ""fully competitive"" until its fiscal third quarter, which is the quarter ending March 31, 2016. That will give a lot of time for rival Western Digital to steal business. Goldman Sachs released a note mid-morning that recommended adding to Western Digital positions on weakness due to Seagate's miss.Due to Seagate's apparent uncompetitive product lineup in nearline storage during the quarter, it is possible that Western Digital can beat gross margin expectations for the quarter (currently at 29.8%) if it sold considerably more drives at potentially higher than expected prices. What is bad for Seagate might be quite positive for Western Digital.The news was not all bad for Seagate shareholders however, as the company also reported strong operating cash flows at approximately $800M. This would be ahead of the September quarter last year by nearly $200M. The company also announced it repurchased approximately 20M shares during the quarter, or approximately 6.6% of the shares outstanding as of June 30. If you assume an average purchase price of $49/share, the company spent $980M on buybacks during the quarter. That is a huge amount and will save the company $43M annually in dividend payments by retiring those shares. The company also reported a cash and equivalents balance of $1.9B at quarter end.Unfortunately the company had to utilize over $600M of net cash to complete the purchase of Dot Hill Systems, which closed in early October. Seagate purchased the high-end SAN storage solutions company in an effort to bolster its downstream storage solutions product offerings. It was really playing catch-up to rival Western Digital (and others), and it had to pay a high price to do so. Dot Hill had revenues totaling $244M for the last twelve months ending June 30. Revenues are expected to continue to grow in at a high-teens percentage over the next couple of years. However profitability is low, with just a 10.5% adjusted EBITDA margin expected in 2015. Seagate will need to take significant costs out of this business if it is to contribute meaningfully to operating cash flows. For the last twelve months Dot Hill only generated $12M in operating cash flows. On that basis, the $600M net cash purchase price seems quite high. In addition, the large cash outflow that has already occurred during the current quarter for the Dot Hill purchase will limit the company's ability to repurchase shares at these lower levels.In conclusion, when Seagate reports full results for the September quarter it will have an uphill battle as it attempts to regain the market's confidence in its product offerings and in its ability to forecast demand for its products. Execution was clearly poor during the September quarter. The company fell behind rivals in terms of product offerings and paid the price with a significantly reduced overall gross margin. Seagate tried to make up for the big miss by repurchasing a large amount of stock during the quarter. The company will also likely increase its dividend at least 10% when it reports earnings on October 30. The question then becomes can Seagate quickly play catch-up and retake lost ground in the enterprise storage space? We all know the headwinds the industry is experiencing, mainly poor PC sales and increased adoption of flash storage technology. As such Seagate has little room for error. It just used one of its mulligans and likely won't get many more. While the fat dividend yield is enticing (currently a 5.2% yield), I'd remain on the sidelines for the time being. The company's recent performance does not inspire confidence and as such it would seem prudent to wait and see where the gross margin goes from here."

One technology stock getting hit particularly hard is Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX). Shares of Seagate Technology are down 37% since the start of the year, while the S&P 500 is down 8% in that time. This has elevated Seagate's dividend to more than a 5% yield, which is abnormally high.STX Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YChartsAnd yet, Seagate itself remains optimistic about the future. Management recently conducted an investor presentation in which it laid out its financial goals for the next two years. If the company's forecast proves accurate, Seagate's cheap stock and 5% yield may be a fantastic buying opportunity for dividend investors.Management vs. Analysts - Who's Right?Usually, management teams of closely-followed companies like Seagate provide forecasts that are generally in-line with what analysts are expecting. But in Seagate's case, opinions are split. According to its presentation, Seagate management forecasts 2%-5% organic revenue growth both this fiscal year and in fiscal 2017 and 10% earnings growth this year.On the other hand, analysts expect Seagate's earnings to decline 3% this fiscal year before rising 13% next fiscal year. Analysts expect Seagate to suffer a 7.7% revenue decline this year and just 2.9% organic revenue growth in fiscal 2017.Given how badly the stock has performed this year, investors are obviously siding with analysts on what the future holds for Seagate. But there are reasons to believe management's version of the state of the business. First and foremost, Seagate is in the process of transitioning its business away from being entirely dependent on the PC. Seagate is trying to build up a cloud business, and to be sure, the turnaround is materializing. Seagate stated it derived 57% of its fiscal 2015 revenue from the cloud and what it terms ""new storage"" applications. That is a significant increase from 43% the previous year, and this could help Seagate meet its revenue growth forecasts.Going forward, the company plans to extend its reach into higher-growth areas even more. This is why Seagate plans to acquire Dot Hill Systems (NASDAQ:HILL) for $645 million excluding cash to further its growth in storage systems and software. Plus, there may be some good news on the PC as well. Analysts with Citi and Wells Fargo are projecting higher-than-expected PC demand this quarter, which would be huge given how badly PC shipments have deteriorated so far this year.Free Cash Flow Supports Cash ReturnsInvestors appear to be panicking because of the decline in Seagate's headline revenue and earnings. Indeed, last quarter, revenue fell 11% and gross margin contracted by 130 basis points, year over year. However, for the full fiscal year, Seagate still grew revenue. And Seagate still produces a lot of free cash flow.For example, last year the company returned $1.8 billion to investors in combined dividends and share repurchases. Seagate could do this because it generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2015. That was more than enough to sustain its aggressive cash return program. The buybacks have been particularly effective. Seagate has reduced its share count by 13% in the past two years.Seagate: Loads Of Value And IncomeIt's easy to be pessimistic about Seagate given its stock price decline this year and the threat of further erosion in PC demand. But it's worth noting that Seagate looks very attractive from both an income and value investing perspective. Shares of Seagate look cheap. The stock trades for just 7 times trailing earnings per share and even after incorporating relatively dour analyst projections, Seagate is valued at 8 times forward EPS estimates.Management and analysts are not on the same page about the next two fiscal years. But to me, the question is not determining who is right. It seems that at $41 per share, Seagate is so cheap, with such a high dividend yield, that management does not have to be proven completely right in order for shareholders to do well.If the company can grow earnings even slightly this year and next year, which is entirely possible, then the combination of earnings growth, modest multiple expansion and the dividend could easily combine to produce double-digit total returns. Revenue and earnings growth would likely flow through to free cash flow growth as well, which would help support management's goal to grow the dividend by 10% per year.As a result, income and value investors should take a closer look at Seagate and its 5% dividend.Disclaimer: This article represents the opinion of the author, who is not a licensed financial advisor.

3668206,90255,2015-11-09T16:57:19-05:00,"After STX's recent quarter, quite a few shareholders have started losing faith in the company.STX is a ""cash cow.""In terms of value creation, STX's performance has been impressive.STX has an incredible sustainable growth rate of around 29%.STX's shares are undervalued and attractively priced compared to investment alternatives within the industry.","Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) announced its Q1 2016 results nearly a week ago. Much to the dismay of STX's shareholders, revenues were at the lower end of the predicted range and gross margin declined. This, however, didn't come as a surprise after the 15th October warning issued by the company.Despite the pessimism, I believe there are reasons why STX may not turn out to be a bad bet at the current price.Cash Flow AnalysisWith FCF standing at ~16% of revenue, STX is undoubtedly a ""cash cow"". STX ended this quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and going forward, the management is looking confident about the company's cash generating prowess. This also explains the company's decision to increase dividend by 17%, and in coming years, STX is expected to boost shareholders' returns further.Generating a lot of cash is one thing and putting it to effective use is another. STX's management, though, has been successful in effectively using the company's free cash. At present, STX generates around $30 for every $100 of invested capital. The chart below compares STX's CROCI with its competitors: SanDisk (SNDK) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). Clearly, none of STX's competitors have managed to convert as much invested capital into cash as STX.STX Cash Return on Capital Invested (CROCI) (TTM) data by YChartsValue CreationIt's important to assess how much capital a company is using to generate its earnings, or in other words, the value a company is creating for its shareholders. This can be done by measuring the difference between Return on Invested Capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) and Working Asset Cost of Capital (OTC:WACC).I have calculated STX's WACC under the following assumptions:Details of the model and calculations can be seen below:(Source: Morningstar)STX's four-year average ROIC is ~34.3%, significantly higher than even my high estimate of the company's WACC. So STX creates at least $19 for every $100 invested in capital, which is very impressive.Sustainable GrowthWith respect to STX's growth outlook, a natural question that comes to mind is how fast STX can grow without external equity issues while keeping leverage unchanged. To answer this question, I've calculated STX's sustainable growth rate by using the following formula:Sustainable Growth Rate = Retention Rate (RR) x Return on Equity (ROE)Here RR = 1 - Dividend Payout RatioSTX's RR comes out to be 0.499, suggesting that the company reinvests ~50% of its earnings. Hence, STX's sustainable growth rate is 0.499 x 57.3% = ~28.6%This is an incredible figure which should make potential investors reasonably confident about STX's growth prospects.ValuationBased on the PS ratio, STX is trading at a discount to its industry peers. As can be seen from the chart below, investors are paying $0.977 for each dollar of STX's sales, which is lower than the value that investors are placing on each dollar of STX's competitors' sales. PS ratio is, in many ways, a better metric than the P/E ratio as earnings tend to be less stable compared to sales.STX PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsUsing the ratio of Price to CFO, we can reach the same conclusion. The chart below shows that currently STX's share price is nearly 4 times the company's CFO, again signaling a discount compared to an average Price-to-CFO ratio of ~11.7 for STX's chosen competitors.STX Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) data by YChartsI've used the DCF model shown below to calculate STX's intrinsic value. My model is based on the following assumptions:(Source: Morningstar)Detailed calculations can be found here.My model shows that after subtracting the market value of debt and adding back cash and investments, the market value of equity is about $13 billion, $20.9 billion and $22.7 billion in the 'low', 'mid' and 'high' scenarios, respectively. This gives a fair value of nearly $39, $63 and $68 for the three scenarios. Even in the ""low"" scenario, STX's shares have an upside potential of 0.4%.ConclusionSTX's stock price has been ruthlessly butchered in the last 12 months. It is clear that there is a lot of pessimism surrounding the company's prospects because of which it is easy to get carried away and overlook its strengths. In my view, STX has the potential to improve its profitability in the future, and right now, the company is undervalued. Hence, buying STX for less than $40 could turn out to be a wise move."
3616306,69695,2015-10-28T17:25:10-04:00,"Seagate recently raised its dividend by 17%, and the stock now yields 6.5%. The market doesn't seem to care.The PC industry remains challenged, but Seagate is making progress in breaking away from the PC by investing in the cloud and new storage applications.Seagate could easily afford to raise its dividend, even though it was already a high-yielder, because it generates a lot of cash flow and is cutting expenses.Seagate remains an excellent opportunity for income investors.","I'm a new shareholder of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), a manufacturer of data storage products like hard disk drives. I wrote about my decision to initiate a position in Seagate in this article, where I stated my belief that Seagate is a cheap stock with strong cash flows. In addition, I pointed to Seagate's hefty 5% dividend yield, and the company's vow to increase its dividend by 10% per year over the next two years. As it happens, Seagate increased its dividend shortly after that article was published ... by a whopping 17%.This now brings its annualized dividend to $2.52 per share, which yields 6.5%. Seagate's big dividend raise exceeded my expectations. I was very pleasantly surprised by the dividend increase, although the market has responded with a collective shoulder shrug.Here's why I remain very positive on Seagate, and why I will add to my position if the stock keeps dropping.How Will Seagate Pay For It?Of course, when a company raises its dividend like this, it is appropriate not just to take the news at face value, but to delve deeper into the company's financial position. This can help determine whether a company can really afford such a strong dividend increase. After all, Seagate was already yielding well above 5% before it raised its dividend. Its dividend yield towered above both the broader market, and especially the technology sector.Naturally, this will raise questions as to how the company will afford its hefty dividend. Fortunately, in Seagate's case, the company generates enough free cash flow. As I mentioned in my last article, Seagate generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2015. In the same period, Seagate returned $1.8 billion to investors in combined dividends and share repurchases. At first glance, this does not seem to leave much room for a 17% dividend increase. But Seagate has plenty of levers to pull to finance such a generous pay raise for its shareholders.We won't know the exact route Seagate took until its upcoming quarterly earnings release, but I'd suspect the company either significantly reduced capital expenditures last quarter, or curtailed its stock buybacks (or a mixture of both). Seagate's dividend itself cost the company $664 million last fiscal year. This accounted for just 35% of its annual free cash flow. That is a fairly low dividend payout ratio, meaning the company could easily increase its dividend, provided it slightly cuts its capital spending and/or share buybacks.As far as capital expenditures, Seagate management has already made it clear that a significant round of spending cuts is under way. Management stated on last quarter's conference call that it expects operating expenses to decline by at least 10% in fiscal 2016. This is why the company expects to produce at least 10% growth in adjusted earnings per share in the upcoming fiscal year, even if revenue grows only in the low single-digit range.In addition, Seagate ended last quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which could be deployed to raise dividends. This would be a value-adding move, since interest rates are still stuck at historic lows, meaning the cash is just burning a hole in the company's pockets. With a current ratio of 2.3 times, Seagate has very sufficient short-term liquidity.Seagate: A Compelling Pick for Income InvestorsI expected Seagate to stay true to its vow to increase its dividend by 10% this fiscal year and next year. But Seagate went above and beyond, and demonstrated a great deal of confidence in the strength of its underlying business and balance sheet. At $39 per share, Seagate yields 6.5%, which is an enormous income opportunity.The market does not seem to care much, preferring instead to punish the stock on fears of an eroding business in an era of declining PC shipments. But as I mentioned in my last article, Seagate is making meaningful progress in diversifying away from the PC. The company derived more than half of its total revenue last year from the cloud and new storage applications. Seagate's transformation will continue to take time, but in the meantime, the company generates a lot of cash.Management is very shareholder-friendly, which I personally love to see. Instead of lavishing themselves with huge stock-based awards, the company is raising its dividend for the benefit of shareholders. If the stock continues to trade below $40, I will not hesitate to add to my position in the weeks ahead.Disclaimer: This article represents the opinion of the author, who is not a licensed financial advisor.

3565016,73495,2015-10-12T04:36:12-04:00,,"Now seems to be a pretty good time to perform a stock analysis as we approach the middle of the month! We have had ups and downs within the market, and it really can't decide which way it truly wants to go. With interest rates remaining on hold (thanks Fed, was really hoping for a bigger discount... kidding!), the market has been a tick upwards over the last 1-2 weeks. I wanted to hop into a sector and stock that has been beaten down this year with what is perceived to be sound dividend metrics. How about the technology sector? Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX) - you are up!The Stock - Seagate Technologies (STX)Per Google Finance: ""Seagate Technology plc (Seagate) is a provider of electronic data storage products. The Company's products are hard disk drives (HDD). The Company produces a range of electronic data storage products, including solid state hybrid drives (SSHD), solid state drives (SSD), peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) cards and Serial AT Attachment (SATA) controllers. The Company's products are designed for enterprise servers and storage systems for applications, client compute applications and client non-compute applications. The Company's product and solution portfolio for the enterprise data storage industry includes storage enclosures, integrated application platforms and high performance computing (HPC) data storage solutions. Its data storage services provide online backup, data protection and recovery solutions for small to medium-sized businesses. Its products include Enterprise Performance HDDs, Mobile HDDs and SSHDs, NAS HDDs, and Surveillance HDDs, among others."" Seagate is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, and is massive in the data storage arena. The main competitors would be SanDisk and Western Digital Corp. At $15B in market capital, Seagate is in between the two competitors and offers some very valid metrics when looking at it from a dividend stock standpoint. No, this isn't a foundation stock, it is definitely far from an Emerson (NYSE:EMR) (which I have bought 3x) and does not even take a sniff at Bert's 5 always buy stocks. Definitely a different approach here.STX - Dividend Diplomat Screener AnalysisWell, as of this writing on 10/11/2015, the stock is trading at $49.03. Using the dividend diplomat stock screener, let's check the stats against 2 competitors from Morningstar and Google:Conclusion on STX Stock AnalysisThis is interesting. Who would have thought Seagate Technologies to be that big of a company as to produce great dividend results and have the right characteristics that us dividend investors love? The only thing that is missing is the ""history"" of dividend increases that we all come to see/want in a stock - but I think time will bode well. There is a market for storage, especially as we all keep transferring devices so frequently and wanting to save everything we have without going full ""cloud""-based. No, the stock wasn't on our September Watch List, but I may have to keep an eye on it. Bert may have to deploy more capital, given that he has cruised past his $15K goal and may be interested in boosting that dividend income up.What does everyone else think of STX right now? Would you purchase at these levels? Like where the market is going? Any takers here? Love the feedback and excited to hear back! Thank you again for stopping by to check this out."
3588886,69695,2015-10-21T09:41:33-04:00,"Shares of Seagate have fallen off a cliff this year, due to worries over slowing economic growth in the emerging markets, and the continued erosion of demand for PCs.Investors appear to be ignoring the fact that Seagate is meaningfully expanding outside of PCs, into higher-growth areas like the cloud and data.Seagate continues to generate high amounts of free cash flow, which it uses to buy back stock and pay dividends. The stock is very cheap and yields 5.6%.For these reasons, I recently initiated a position in Seagate at $38 per share.","This has been a brutal year for Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX). The stock is down 42% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 Index is down just 1%. Seagate stock has had a very tough year, as the company is getting hit by a number of headwinds. The most concerning of which include the economic slowdown in the emerging markets, such as China, and the weak PC market this year.As a result, investors are selling Seagate with both hands. This has pushed Seagate's valuation to extreme lows, and has elevated its dividend yield to an extreme high.While this may scare off some investors, I see this as a tremendous opportunity to buy a cash-generating machine at a very cheap valuation and a high dividend yield. Here's why I recently bought shares of Seagate for $38 per share.Emerging Market Slowdown, Weak PC Demand Hit SeagateThe erosion in the PC market is a significant concern for Seagate. Indeed, according to technology market research firm IDC, PC shipments fell 10.8% last quarter, year over year. This was even worse than the 9.2% decline analysts had expected.Reflecting these challenges, Seagate pre-announced its first fiscal quarter results and warned investors that revenue would come in at approximately $2.9 billion, close to the lower end of its forecasted range for fiscal first quarter of revenue of $2.9 billion-$3.1 billion. Moreover, gross margin is expected to reach 24%, which is three percentage points below the company's prior guidance.But I'm not worried about the emerging markets, nor am I worried about Seagate's business in the PC market or in general. First, economic growth may slow in the emerging markets, but the under-developed nations still represent the greatest opportunity for economic growth in the world. Seagate is vulnerable right now, because it derives the majority of its revenue from outside the U.S., but I see aggressive investment in the emerging markets as the right long-term strategy.With regard to the PC industry, again Seagate is exposed to this downturn. But the company has gradually built up its business outside of the PC. For example, in fiscal 2010 Seagate earned 37% of its total revenue from the cloud and new storage applications. In fiscal 2015, that figure stood at 57%, and that percentage should only increase from here due to Seagate's recent acquisition of Dot Hill Systems (NASDAQ:HILL) for $645 million excluding cash, which should enhance Seagate's position in higher-growth businesses.Free Cash Flow Leads To Huge Cash ReturnsBased on Seagate's earnings pre-announcement, it is likely that revenue will come in lower than analysts previously anticipated this quarter. And, revenue may very well decline for the full year. But meanwhile, Seagate continues to generate significant free cash flow, and that is the foundation of my bullishness on the stock. Seagate produced $1.9 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2015. Based on an enterprise value of $13 billion, Seagate trades for just 7 times enterprise value to free cash flow, which is an attractive valuation.In addition, Seagate uses its free cash flow to handsomely reward shareholders with buybacks and dividends. Last year, Seagate returned $1.8 billion to investors in combined dividends and share repurchases. Seagate has done a great job of effectively using buybacks to reduce its share count by 13% in the past two years. And, the dividend yield is now 5.6%, thanks to the continued share price decline this year.Plus, there may even be an opportunity for Seagate to raise the dividend. The company has aggressively utilized free cash for share buybacks, and has taken on some additional debt to finance this. For example, the company held $4.1 billion of long-term debt at the end of last quarter, up from $3.9 billion in the same quarter last year. But I would expect Seagate to wind down its aggressive stock repurchase program, because rising interest rates will make tapping the debt markets much more costly.And, Seagate intends to raise its dividend by 10% per year over the next two fiscal years. If Seagate does raise its dividend by 10% per year, the dividend would reach an annualized $2.61 per share. That would provide an outstanding 6.7% yield based on its current stock price.Taking AdvantageI last wrote about Seagate and why I thought the stock was a great opportunity for value and income, in this article, on September 29. Shortly after that article, shares of Seagate quickly rallied from $41 per share at the time the article was published, to $49 per share. Then, Seagate released its earnings pre-announcement, and the stock crashed all the way to its current level of $38. At this price, I think Seagate is a fantastic opportunity, and I'm taking advantage.For all the reasons mentioned above, I recently bought shares of Seagate for $38 per share.Disclaimer: This article represents the opinion of the author, who is not a licensed financial advisor.

3321505,24105,2015-07-14T13:51:12-04:00,"STX and WDC have each declined substantially from recent highs.They are both trading at low price earnings ratios.More importantly, cash flow has generally been higher than earnings due to very high depreciation.WDC is now trading at an enterprise/cash flow multiple of 6.86; STX is at 7.33.At these levels, the market is pricing in unrealistically negative assumptions and the stocks are each compelling buys.","I have written before about Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) in one article calling them the ""ugly sisters"" because of the level of investor disdain (at the time, STX was trading at $27.68 and WDC was trading at $37.78). They have each had major pull backs in the last few months. Friday, STX closed at $45.95 (its 52-week high was $69.40) and WDC closed at $77.10 (its 52-week high was $114.69). Both stocks are often described as ""disk drive"" companies although changes in the technology definitely indicate that ""data storage"" is a more accurate description. Both companies have fiscal years ending in June so that they are reasonably easy to compare.The history of their business is complex and can be misleading. For a very long time, the disk drive business was fiercely competitive with prices constantly declining as drives with more and more capacity on less and less space kept coming out. The business was also fragmented and price competition was intense. A few years ago, STX and WDC each made a large acquisition and when the dust settled, the two of them controlled roughly 90% of the market. Since then, they have become cash flow machines generating huge amounts of cash and using a great deal of it for dividends and share repurchases.Ever since I started following these stocks, there has always been an undercurrent of concern that the business may become technologically obsolescent due to new technologies. I am sure that this article will provoke comments of that type and that the comment stream will devolve into technologically complex discussions of various emerging threats to their business. Indeed, one of the most reliable financial headlines (after ""Greek Financial Situation Deteriorates"" and ""Venezuelans Line Up to Buy Toilet Paper"") has been ""Disk Drive Companies Face Massive Competitive Threat."" This perception explains the current pricing of these stocks.The reality is that the anticipated decline has never really materialized. WDC and - perhaps to a lesser extent - STX seem to be involved in the solid state technology which is picking up a bigger share of storage and they each certainly have the cash flow to make the acquisitions and investments to keep up with technological advances. I do not think that this will be a replay of what happened to American television manufacturers when solid state technology from Japan suddenly swept the market and left them high and dry.The stocks have become so cheap that the market is now pricing in substantial and sustained declines in the business. The table below provides - for each company - per share cash flow, net cash, enterprise value and the enterprise value/cash flow ratio. The numbers are based on SEC filings and include an annualization of the nine months (already reported) of the current fiscal year. I prefer using cash flow because each of the companies has a big depreciation deduction.STX has net debt so that its net cash number is negative. Each of the companies is gushing cash. STX has reduced share count from 463 million to 330 million over the past three years. WDC's share count reduction has been less dramatic (from 245 million to 231 million over the past two years). In each case, share repurchases may start ramping up due to these depressed prices. Each company pays a reasonable dividend (WDC yields 2.6% and STX yields 4.7%) and the cash flow as calculated above clearly creates the opportunity for substantial dividend increases going forward.Each company's fortunes are - to a degree - tied to the troubled PC market because they make substantial sales in the PC OEM market and we may be in a lull for the next quarter or two due to a pending software release this Fall which could pick up sales and revenue later in the year. In this market, there are not many opportunities to pick up assets generating after-tax cash flow of 14 or 15% of the amount invested. Unless something very, very bad is about to happen very, very soon, these stocks will reward investors handsomely. I really don't see a sufficiently ominous cloud on the horizon to justify these low valuations.My advice to investors is to buy some of each unless you have a very strong reason to develop an opinion on which of the two will be more successful moving forward. Needless to say, I am long WDC and STX."
3291155,68555,2015-06-29T13:07:28-04:00,Annual failure rate of disks will partly offset the drop in PC shipments.Seagate is well positioned to gain traction in the enterprise storage sphere.The company has many competitive advantages over peers.Seagate is a good buy on the pullback.,"The global digital universe is growing at a hectic pace. In fact, as cited in my piece on Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), it is expected to grow to over 44 trillion gigabytes by the end of 2020. This, of course, comes in different forms like cloud storage, enterprise storage, PC/Laptop and big data storage to name a few.While companies like Western Digital and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) are struggling due to the weakness in the PC market, the companies are making progress in other departments that will likely offset the downfall.Since I've already discussed Western Digital in my last article, I will focus on Seagate. According to a report from Statista, the decline in shipments is here to stay, as shown in the chart below:Source: StatistaHowever, notebook sales are projected to be above 2015 levels in 2016 and 2017. Average combined sales from 2015 as per the chart above works out to 315.7 million units, representing 2.2% decline over the 2015 reference year.While it's true that PC shipments are slowing down, not all of this 2.2% decline will result into loss of sales of storage drives for Seagate. This is because of the Annual Failure Rate (AFR) of consumer drives will partly offset the decline in sales to OEMs.According to Google's study, the AFR in the fourth and fifth year of disk life worked out to just over 6%. Although this data is for the harsher workload of data-center environment compared to personal computers, failures are not unheard of even in a personal computing environment. Even Seagate's product sheet for ES class drives confirms AFR to be 0.73% under ideal operating conditions. Consumer class drives will have a higher AFR.Assuming that AFR for consumer class drives is approximately 1%, the drop of 2.2% in shipments will not result in a similar decline in disk sales.Enterprise storage is growingAccording to a ReportsnReports.com report, the global enterprise storage market is projected to increase at a CAGR of 15% over the period 2015-2019. To bolster its position in the higher-margin SSD market, Seagate acquired LSI's flash business from Avago (NASDAQ:AVGO) in 2014. On enterprise mission-critical storage devices and hybrid storage solutions, Dave Mosley, President, Operations and Technology, said:Competitive advantagesSeagate has several competitive advantages over Western Digital. As shown in the chart below, Seagate has a comparatively lower P/S and P/E ratio. Also, Seagate is generating around 50% more sales per employee and ROIC of almost double that of Western Digital.WDC PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsGiven its higher sales per employee and better ROIC, Seagate has far more room for investing in research and development. In fact, Seagate recently opened a new 40,000 square-feet R&D facility in Singapore for innovating on small form-factor hard drives, hybrid drives, firmware, software and other related technologies. With this, the company expanded its presence in the APAC region.Seagate already is the market leader in 2 terabyte 2.5-inch drives in areal density, and all work-in-progress areal density improvements will be ported to the majority of its products in fiscal 2016. The focus on small form factor storage devices will be a long-term growth driver.Moreover, the company's board authorized an additional buyback program worth $2.5 billion, taking the total to $3.1 billion. This will help in allowing the company to repurchase shares and thus keep a lid on a steep decline in stock price, besides adding to bottom-line growth.Final wordsThe storage industry growth is here to stay. With the proliferation of cloud computing, secular growth of digital data and an ever growing need for storing and retrieving mission-critical enterprise data, Seagate is well placed to benefit from the global storage market trends. The company's focus on research and development will sustain its lead in the 2.5-inch drives and its strong position in the enterprise desktop market will be another growth catalyst.With a healthy ROIC of around 28%, P/S ratio of 1.187 and forward P/E of 10.45, it looks like an enticing investment for the long-term. Also, the stock has a high dividend yield of 4%. Down 22% YTD, Seagate is a good value play."
3438216,67855,2015-08-14T16:26:47-04:00,Stock is trading at a P/E ratio of 9.8x.Industry will continue to grow.Current profits should be stable.,"In this series, I will select a low P/E stock to analyze. I define low P/E as anywhere from 5x to 10x, as any lower and we may be looking at special situations. Read the last edition here!Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) is a technology company that specializes in electronic data storage products and solutions. I'm sure that many of you have heard of this company as it is a household name for hard-drives. Despite its popularity, the stock has languished recently. Shares have declined 11% from one year ago to $51.46 today, comparing to the S&P 500 which returned 7% over the same time period. At the current price, shares are trading at a TTM P/E of 9.8x, let's see if this spells an opportunity.Growth ProspectsThere is no denying that our world is becoming increasingly digital. The effect is that there will be more and more demand for electronic storage. For example, the advent of tablets and smartphones opened up a whole new market for hardware manufacturers. Services that distribute large amounts of data (e.g. Netflix, Youtube) also created demand for storage that did not exist before. Overall, I think that the industry as a whole has a lot of growth potential.What I LikeThe company is in a highly competitive industry. As hardware is highly commoditized, it is hard for company to differentiate itself (think the appeal Apple vs. multiple brands of hard-drive). However, the company seems to have overcome that challenge and is able to earn a decent margin on its products and services.The above chart illustrates the gross and operating margin over the past couple of years. As you can see, although there has been fluctuations, gross margin generally stayed above 25% and operating margin above 10%. To me, this signals that the company was able to create a brand following and compete on something other than price, which allowed the company to sustain its profitability.The company also has a great balance sheet. As of FYE 2015 (ended July 3), the company had $4.2 billion in long-term debt. This may seem high when viewed in isolation, but when compared to a whopping $2.5 billion in cash and an additional $700 million available under the company's credit facility, it is clear that the debt is very manageable.What I Don't LikeThere really isn't much to dislike about the company. We can see from the chart below that operating cash flow has scaled along with revenue, meaning that growth has generated value as opposed to paper profits.However, the company seems to have hit a roadblock recently, as we are not seeing meaningful growth. Despite the aforementioned growth in the industry, it seems that the company could not capitalize on this trend. However, I don't think we should be worried. We as outsiders can't pinpoint exactly when the company will push out a revolutionary product to drive revenue, but we can say with reasonable certainty that the company will at least continue to generate the current amount of profits over the long-term. Hence, I believe that Seagate Technology is worth your consideration at its current price."

Seagate's total enterprise hard drive shipments have grown at a CAGR of under 5% from 2010 through 2014 to 33 million drives in calendar year 2014. Comparatively, the enterprise SSD market has shot up in the same period. According to Storage Newsletter, the enterprise SSD market is expected to reach $4 billion in revenues by 2016, nearly six times where it was in 2011, while unit shipments are expected to increase by ten times during that period. [1] Furthermore, a key growth area for storage providers is the growing demand for flash arrays or storage racks that use SSDs instead of hard drives. In an attempt to cater to a broader customer base, Seagate announced the acquisition of storage array and storage software provider Dot Hill Systems for $645 million in an all-cash transaction. [2]We have a $56 price estimate for Seagate's stock, which is slightly higher than the current market price. Seagate's stock price has fallen by about 25% since the beginning of the year. The company has agreed to purchase Dot Hill systems at $9.75 per share, which was an 88% premium to the most recent stock price before the announcement and a 50% premium over the preceding three-month stock price average of Dot Hill.Integrating Dot Hill Storage And Possible ImpactDot Hill Storage is a provider of storage arrays and virtualization software solutions for a vast array of customers ranging from small and medium businesses (SMBs) to enterprise OEMs. The company has an enterprise value of $645 million; the acquisition is likely to be completed by the end of the year, and its results will be accretive to Seagate's earnings in the latter half of the company's fiscal 2016 ended June.Dot Hill sells storage-area network (SAN) arrays to clients across various industries including telecom, oil & gas, digital imaging, analytics and big data. The company has a tiered storage architecture, using both SSDs and enterprise-grade hard drives in the storage racks. The hybrid flash array (HFA) or network-based storage system that utilizes both flash media and traditional spinning disks in its storage architecture. This configuration balances the cost vs. performance dilemma for most customers. Using SSDs in the capacity ranging from 2% to 5% of total available storage can effectively improve the total input/output operations per second (IOPS) by almost 100% and reduce latency from 10 milliseconds to as low as 3 milliseconds. [3] Although this is higher than the <1 milliseconds latency offered by a many all-flash arrays (AFA), the total cost of owning a HFA is typically lower than an AFA. As a result, the HFA market is currently considerably larger than the AFA market. According to IDC, the HFA market stood at about $10 billion in 2014 while the AFA market size was estimated at about $1.3 billion for the year. [4] HFA is expected to become a $14 billion market through 2018, while the AFA market is expected to grow at a faster pace to become a $3.5 billion market by 2018. [5]The integration of Dot Hill within Seagate could lead to cost synergies, enabling Dot Hill arrays to source Seagate hard drives at possibly lower costs than competing array makers. Furthermore, Seagate already has data storage testing equipment maker Xyratex and LCI's PCI Express SSD storage technology under its belt. Additionally, Dot Hill sells storage software bundled with its products that include data migration software tools, backup & data recovery software suites and virtualization compatible with both VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS). A converged solution with the aforementioned capabilities could provide meaningful growth for the company. According to Dot Hill's management, the company expects non-GAAP revenue of about $250 million for 2015. [6]Starting from early 2016, Seagate can position itself to compete with storage systems vendors such as EMC (EMC) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) in addition to rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). Other companies that are active in the flash array arena include computing giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) and a number of small vendors including Pure Storage, Violin Memory, SolidFire, Kaminaro and Nimbus Data.Continued Consolidation Across The Storage IndustryEMC has been active in the market over the last few years, enhancing its flash storage and cloud infrastructure capabilities. The company acquired cloud computing management software and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) provider Virtustream for $1.2 billion in May this year and flash chip-maker DSSD in May 2014. EMC acquired flash array maker XtremIO in 2012 and released its first all-flash array in late 2013. Similar to the Dot Hill acquisition, SanDisk (SNDK) acquired storage hardware and software systems manufacturer Fusion-io for approximately $1.1 billion in June 2014. Additionally, SanDisk acquired enterprise class SSD manufacturer SMART Storage Systems for about $307 million in July 2013.Leading hard drive makers Seagate and Western Digital have acquired flash storage companies and startups over the last few years to boost SSD sales and to complement their hard drive businesses. Since 2013, Western Digital acquired a number of companies such as Virident, SSD maker sTec and enterprise SSD manufacturer Velobit. Similarly, Seagate acquired enterprise data storage systems and testing equipment maker Xyratex for $374 million in late 2013 to enhance its enterprise storage offerings. To add to the Xyratex acquisition, Seagate announced the acquisition of LSI's Flash Components Division and Accelerated Solution Division from networking semiconductor and chip manufacturer Avago Technology (NASDAQ:AVGO) for $450 million in May 2014.Seagate's enterprise storage division has posted solid numbers in 2015 thus far. Enterprise HDD unit shipments have risen by almost 15% year-over-year to 17.3 million units through the first two quarters of calendar year 2015. We estimate that Seagate's enterprise storage unit shipments will increase from 33 million in 2014 to over 60 million by the end of our forecast period. If the unit shipments increase more our current forecast to about 65 million be the end of the decade, it could imply a 7-8% upside to our $56 price estimate for Seagate's stock.Disclosure: No positions."
3471846,92826,2015-08-27T14:15:37-04:00,"The HDD business is clearly in secular decline.The dangers from declining tech demand, SSD substitution, Western Digital, etc. are higher than they have ever been.Stock support will collapse as it becomes clear the dividend is at risk.","Do you want to be an owner of this business?Quarterly Adjusted Net Income (in millions)The prudent investor, suspecting a trick question, should ask at what price? For Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), the answer is ~15x last quarter annualized earnings (of the adjusted variety). And in my opinion, earnings will continue to decline over time. So the diligent investor should perhaps conclude that the potential reward is nowhere close to compensating the investors for the risk.One could conclude Seagate is the perfect example of the current late-stage bull market: stock significantly higher than 2012 levels despite falling EPS? Check. Stock buybacks and acquisitions supported by leveraging the balance sheet with new debt? Check. Large chunk of passive/ETF investors? Check. Zero interest rate policy induced dividend buyers? Check. Sell-side analysts moving in a herd and ignoring secular risks? Check. Very light trading volumes and limited liquidity? Check. Investors have forgotten that this is a cyclical business? Check.A little housekeeping - readers can find most of the facts mentioned in this article on this handy page. The other facts and figures can be found in Seagate's and Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) public disclosures (STX here and WDC here).First, let's talk about the risks to Seagate's business:Risk 1. Lower end-market demand due to weaker macro (i.e., we have entered a tech demand cycle)Tech demand is falling in lots of markets and especially in emerging economies. China is often discussed, but keep in mind many economies and currencies are plummeting (Russia, Brazil, Turkey, Malaysia, South Africa, Mexico, Kenya, Kazakhstan, etc.), and goods priced in USD are increasingly expensive for local consumers. Emerging market economies can't print money and have to implement painful fiscal adjustments. We will likely start seeing consumers in Europe and the US start to pull back on capex/expenditures. How much will US energy companies spend on the latest technology? I'd bet a lot less than they were.Risk 2. Lower end-market demand due to technology substitutionIt's been a long time coming, but SSDs using NAND (aka flash) are finally at a price point where they are going to become mainstream for storage. A 128GB SSD can be purchased by an OEM for $40 today. 256GB for close to $70.The 3D NAND which is coming to the market now is significantly better performance than regular (planar) NAND and will also reduce costs at an increasing rate. By better performance, I mean that 3D NAND will have more endurance, use less power, and have higher speeds than planar NAND (win, win, win). It's likely that 3D NAND costs per bit will drop by 40%+ per year for a long time. HDDs aren't currently dropping prices per bit by anywhere close to 40%, so the price gap between HDDs and SSDs will narrow, at least for the next few years. SSD adoption rates, which have increased meaningfully over the past year, are set to hit the sweet spot of the S-curve. Meanwhile, Seagate will have to continue to invest in R&D and capex while gross margins are shrinking or risk that their technology becomes less relevant more quickly.Unlike the last major cycle in 2008/2009, this time SSDs are a meaningful substitution threat to HDDs. In a slowing economy, SSD prices will fall and HDDs will have to compete on price or lose business.There are a couple of ""bright spots"" in HDD markets, but all the end markets are eventually at risk. For example, gaming consoles (Xbox, PS4) use HDDs today, but the next-generation platforms that will be out in a few years will most likely not have HDDs. (to expand on this… HDDs are a bottleneck on the quality of the graphics and user experience because of their poor IOPS. No serious gamer would use an HDD in their laptop or desktop to play video games).A variant on the technology substitution theme is the secular decline in PCs (both laptop and desktop sales are declining). People are still buying computing devices, but they are increasingly in the form of smartphones and netbooks which use NAND storage.You might be wondering what I have against HDDs - nothing really; they served their purpose for the past few decades. It's just that it's not a great technology for where the world is today and where it will be in 3 years or 5 years. The biggest problem in my opinion is that disks can only spin so fast before heat, power, reliability, etc. become a problem. For that reason IOPS or read/write speeds don't improve with time. Interface standards (NVMe, PCIe, SAS, etc.) are evolving to take advantage of the speed of NAND. HDDs moving 80 megabytes of data per second are just going to be increasingly irrelevant in a world of gigabytes, terabytes and petabytes. For that reason, HDDs will become what tape is for storage today. And I expect the market to figure this out over the next year or two.To be clear, I'm not claiming HDDs are going away completely. But in the next few years it will become clear their key use will be for backup/cloud applications.Risk 3. MOFCOM (Chinese antitrust)China has a nationalist premier. China wants US tech companies to lower prices and for Chinese companies to replace US suppliers.While China has no announced plans to enter the HDD market (unlike the market for say mobile chips where it has put a target on Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) back), you can be sure that China will pressure HDD companies to lower prices (more on this later). And the billions of dollars China is investing in 3D NAND and other memory technologies could hasten the decline of the HDD industry. Finally, there is some greater than 0 probability that China would buy Toshiba's (OTCPK:TOSYY) HDD business... Toshiba could use the cash and it would be an effective and cheap way to keep STX and WDC in line. I admit the scenario seems low probability. But you have to take into account a low probability event that cuts your stock price in half.OK, now let's talk about recent stock price action. Relative to fundamentals, the HDD stocks have held up surprisingly well. Why?Reason 1. Western Digital reported on July 29th (2 days before Seagate) and WDC stock surged after reporting and STX went up in sympathy. Western Digital didn't have anything good to say about demand or guidance (which was weak). What it did say that it is increasingly confident that MOFCOM would allow the integration of the Western Digital and Hitachi subsidiaries (after a 3+ year wait). Why is this important? Because WDC has many hundreds of millions, and likely more than a billion dollars, of cost reductions at stake.Now a small detour before returning to the recent stock price action. If you listen closely, WDC makes it clear that it will pass along some of the cost savings from the consolidation to customers in the form of lower prices. Did WDC offer lower prices to MOFCOM or did MOFCOM demand lower prices as a quid pro quo for approving the subsidiary consolidation? Either way… WDC is going to have a bunch of cost savings and will hurt Seagate when it lowers prices (STX's net income margin is currently less than 10%... so even if WDC lowers HDD prices by 2%, which it can afford to do with the cost saves, that would have a huge impact on STX's net income).By the way, WDC has very large operations in Malaysia, a currency which is depreciating rapidly, giving WDC a small COGS advantage vs. STX.Western Digital hates Seagate. And that was before Seagate made WDC pay it $773mm for an industrial espionage claim in late 2014. Western Digital in my opinion has a better management team and has executed very well in the SSD business where revenues are approaching $1bn annually. I have no doubt that WDC wants to make STX's management look stupid (the STX CEO is fond of taking jibes at WDC in front of investors and anyone else that will listen), and I think there is a good chance that it will given the advantages noted above.Despite the circumstances noted above, Western Digital trades at 12.5x LQA earnings (vs. 15x at STX). WDC is also net cash while STX has net debt. These multiples are also before the net savings that WDC will get from the subsidiary consolidation - it wouldn't be surprising for the event to add 20% or more to WDC's EPS. You may ask why given these facts does WDC trades at a lower earnings multiple? It's simple - WDC pays a modest dividend and STX pays a large dividend. With zero interest rate policy, the ETF/passive and dividend buyers… well you get the picture. I'll close by saying that this advantage that STX has with high dividend-seeking buyers could go away as the ETF/passive/dividend-seeking fund flow results in a stampede the other way.Reason 2. Seagate reported on July 31 and said it is aiming to increase earnings 10% YoY in fiscal 2016 (ending June). The company said a combination of improving demand, buybacks and expense control will get it there.See my comments on demand above and below. To be clear, STX's guidance is dependent on market demand. That's like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) telling investors that we will make a bajillion dollars if we sell a bajillion iPhones. The HDD industry always ships a very large percentage of its product in the last week or two of each quarter. Talk about a crappy customer supplier dynamic. Seagate and WDC have limited visibility into what is going to happen at the end of September. To be fair, the September quarter is probably less back-end loaded than the June quarter, but the bigger point remains, STX and WDC have no clue today what current quarter revenues will be. Don't believe me? Check their ability to predict the last few quarters… they have severely missed guidance the last 2 quarters.Many months ago, STX made the mistake of talking about a 60 /40 split in terms of demand of high capacity enterprise drives between H2 calendar 2015 and H1 calendar 2015 (always painting a brighter tomorrow). Analysts have subsequently asked them about this every chance they get. If you listen closely to the public comments, STX responds very carefully saying the 60/40 pattern is what it would expect based on the historical empirical pattern of seasonality, but it clearly stops short of saying that's what it expects in 2015 based on customer demand trends or order visibility. And of course sell-side analysts don't push STX to elaborate and it doesn't make it clear to investors that STX and WDC have no freaking clue what the rest of this year will be like.Which brings me to another detour about the IR and sell-side role. The sell-side for the most part functions to summarize what the company is saying and publish it. It's hard to blame them though because even those who were bearish gave up many years ago and investors don't really seem to care what is going on as long as they get their dividend check. The earnings calls have been reduced to a joke. Seagate limits calls to 30 minutes. The last one started at 9am on a summer Friday and ended after a handful of questions because ""the market is open"".Seagate might be cutting some opex, but is it a positive when a declining business cuts costs? Did long-term investors benefit when newspaper and yellow page companies cut costs? Let's be more specific - perhaps Seagate will cut its 15k RPM R&D team… well, I happen to think that's a bad sign because it is clear that the 15k RPM business is going away in favor of SSDs (i.e., the gross margin dollars and earnings contribution of that business are going away and you are only cutting costs to avoid large negative earnings). The cost savings are one time… but the revenues and gross margins will continue degrading. The company is also cutting costs in areas where internal investments and acquisitions haven't worked out (e.g., cloud). Translation: We tried to reinvent the business but it is not going as planned.When Seagate reported earnings, it said the company repurchased ~14.5mm shares in July. Last week, it announced the acquisition of Dot Hill for $645mm net of acquired cash. It was done at a 88% stock price premium. Between the buybacks and the acquisition, Seagate has spent $1.3bn of cash this quarter (and possibly more if it bought stock in August).STX ended the last quarter with $4.2bn of debt and $2.5bn of cash; less the approximately $1.3bn it spent and plus the possible couple hundred million in FCF this quarter (remember it will have restructuring and severance costs to pay) might leave the company with $4.2bn of debt and ~$1.5bn of cash at the end of September (pro forma for the acquisition). Not the best position to be in entering a cycle.Reason 3. Two weeks ago, per Twitter posts, there were STX buyout rumors. Supposedly PE funds were interested at $65.In my opinion, it would be too big, too expensive, too stupid. These rumors probably get started by trapped bulls or purposefully people manipulating the markets.Silver Lake and Bain Capital, and possibly TPG would be the obvious buyers and they aren't dumb enough to buy STX for $65. It would be a >$20bn deal. I don't think they have the money nor do I think they could raise the money.The company will probably get bought by PE at the end of the next cycle when earnings go to 0 or negative, and Steve Luczo takes the company private at a bargain with the cash he has built up selling stock over the past few years.What's going to happen from here?You may want to know what I think STX's stock is worth? Probably $15-$20 intrinsic value (based on $1.50-$2 of normalized earnings, though that could be optimistic). That value estimate is supported by a nice tax structure (which it hasn't done much with), but could conceivably be useful in the right circumstances.Seagate has an analyst day coming up where it will no doubt talk about the long-term trends of data growth and how it is innovating to meet unique customer environments. This has been the message for many, many years. Meanwhile, the ice cube is melting. Don't be fooled.OK, so hopefully I've convinced you to sell STX, short STX, or sell STX and buy WDC.Here is one more thought about what you could do with your newfound liquidity. Buy Micron (NASDAQ:MU). Macro sentiment, industry sentiment, and company sentiment are very poor. Micron trades at $15 and change or roughly a $16bn market cap. That's below the >$20bn cost to replace its assets (it is spending >$6bn on capex and R&D next year alone). Normalized earnings are probably $3 and possibly even $4 if the new 3D cross point technology is good (remember the product will be priced like a monopoly). So to repeat, ~70% or less of replacement cost, <5x normalized earnings. Seems cheap and a much better value than STX. With MU, you also have some asset protection on the downside whereas STX's PPE and tangible book value suggest only a few billion of asset protection. MU does not pay a dividend - but one day it will pay a higher dividend than STX, either in cash and/or in the form of appreciated stock. Of that, I'm confident.Postscript: Note my comment below, which I wrote to address other user comments."
3280545,27231,2015-06-24T10:20:32-04:00,"Seagate Technology is a company that provides low-to-moderate exposure with respect to overall business risk.12% of the current price represents a premium for Seagate’s future growth.A small margin of safety of 12% is available on its own, but when share repurchases are included this increases to 40%.Implied expectations for sales and free cash flows appear excessively conservative, though the range of current Wall Street estimates provides a very favorable risk-return profile.","In January of this year, one of our analysts at Saibus quickly checked Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), providing a quick article on the sustainability of Seagate's dividends and investors' potential source of returns.He concluded his article with:After recalibrating our risk and valuation models back in March, while we still agree with the previous analyst's outlook for operating margins and perhaps the implication of net income remaining stagnant, we revised our opinion on STX's dividend as investors' source of returns. The company is a serial repurchaser of its own stock and at least enjoys decent returns on invested capital, notwithstanding the suspect growth prospects.We proceed with the rest of the article.Risk Assessment:Seagate Technology was evaluated using a systematic, rule-based risk assessment method. It is a balanced scorecard that considers the past performance, historical volatility, and underlying trend of over 40 different risk factors in multiple factor groups and utilizes proprietary standards to systematically score these risk factors across five levels. We believe such analysis adds value for the reader, as they adequately define the major risks in any business, accurately measure them, and succinctly describe them in an easily comprehensible format.Source: Saibus ResearchWith all but creditworthiness rated as a low-to-moderate risk by our process, it is not surprising that the overall risk coming from Seagate's entire enterprise is more or less the same.The reason behind the comparatively higher risk rating for Creditworthiness falls on liquidity, since current liabilities consistently comprised 55% of liabilities, at least until the past two fiscal years and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2015.Source: Saibus ResearchSure, the favorable solvency ratios and the very, very low chance of bankruptcy within the next 12 months or the next three years for that matter suggest that the long-term financial health of the company is not something to be concerned with at the moment. However, the moderate liquidity risk on both asset-based and earnings-based liquidity ratios implies some caution is warranted as short-term fluctuations in STX's ability to service current liabilities are subject to moderate risk.But with the rest looking decent, we go straight to Future Prospects prior to the valuation analysis.We consider Future Prospects from two perspectives. First, we considered the possibility the company may surprise Wall Street's expectations for cash flow per share, returns on assets, and returns on equity over the next three fiscal years. Second, we contrasted Wall Street's forward 10Y EPS growth projections against the market-implied expectation of same, if the data is available.Source: Saibus ResearchAlthough this cannot completely substitute for true industry research, which relay the qualitative trends and developments noted by technical and economic experts in an industry, and a thorough, qualitative perusal of the firm's strategic focus and adherence to its organizational values, appraising the detailed expectations set by Wall Street's sell-side research allows us to grasp the future prospect of the company by proxy.The table below details Reuters' compilation of analyst estimates (after adjusting them for the analysts' track record and level of experience) for Seagate's financial performance, looking ahead over the next three fiscal years.Source: Thomson Reuters. Analyst estimates for revenues and degree of profitability were also included for clarity.From a growth perspective, Seagate does not look like an exciting place to be in. We also saw some warning signs from the historical figures, which may explain the rather low ex-buyback valuation we pegged the business at.Referencing the table above, revenues are expected to stagnate at the $14 billion arena, while profitability margins would be just as stable. Capital expenditures would be low at 5%, well below the 6.89% average we've seen historically and in line with the downward trend seen over the past several years.With depreciation clocking in at 6.54% of sales per year on average, it would suggest that STX has no plans on expanding its fixed assets. We've also noted that R&D has generally been 8.23% of sales per year with little variability in its most recent 10-year history.Being a manufacturing company, this suggests that STX does not seem to have struck gold despite all the R&D it has expensed, at least not enough to convince it to ramp up capital expenditures rather than letting it slide. In addition, Seagate has typically been outspent by its peers, which may not bode well for the company's future in the long-term.Returns on invested capital are expected to drop gradually, and from the looks of the table above, leverage would remain quite large at 66% percent.Lastly, we compared the market-implied expectations for EPS growth over the next 10 years against those expected by the sell-side analysts working at large firms. Wall Street expects EPS to grow 5.40% a year, whereas the market price implies growth of 0.11% a year over the same time frame, demonstrating a difference of 551 basis points. (Source: Thomson Reuters) We find this gap encouraging.Source: Thomson ReutersShortening our time frame to a five-year period, we see a much larger discrepancy, with an 880 basis-point difference. This increase our confidence in the possibility Seagate can provide exceptional returns over the long run. But with growth a little questionable and the company evidently not that gung ho for its R&D programs, a significant source of its value will more likely come from something else provided STX maintains the status quo.Valuation Analysis:Proceeding forward, we ran our valuation analysis using a risk-adjusted WACC of 9.02%, a terminal growth rate equal to 0.76% in long-term inflation (Ireland), average free cash flow margins of 10.08%, which reflects a 14.48% operating margin, a 17.14% tax rate (highest seen in the last ten years - Q2 2015 to be specific), and net investments equivalent to 0.35% of sales. We also use a competitive advantage period of 10 years to account for STX's high returns on invested capital and low-to-moderate risk from the economic moat.Enterprise values as computed are subject to a positive $28.42 billion adjustment that accounts for non-operating cash, debt, dilution, potential future repurchases, as well as other extraneous factors like deferred tax liabilities. This overall adjustment corresponds to $26.12 per share. Of this amount, negative $12.35 goes straight to the impact of STX's financial obligations, while positive $31.79 stems from the net of dilutive securities and the antidilutive value of future share repurchases, since the company has spent a total of more than $10 billion on share repurchase, eight times over the last ten years, with the value has been consistent around this amount. If we were to exclude the share repurchases, the per-share adjustment falls $28.36.Source: Saibus Research. Growth value includes share repurchase adjustment of $28.36. Without it, the Growth Value would be $61.20.In a steady state scenario, we presumed sales to instantly decline 15% to $11.60 billion and stay there, with profit margins steady at 8% (calculated with a 12.3% operating margin and the statutory tax rate). Capitalizing the profits and adjusting them will yield a $15.12 billion equity value, or $47.65 per share. Future share repurchases are not accounted for in the Stagnation Value.In a growth scenario, using the conservative assumptions as defined above, we further presumed a conservative CAGR sales growth of 3.95% in the years after FY 2019, which presumes the company would have found a way to adapt to its changing market environment and ""strike gold"", as the saying goes, with their R&D expenditures. We also reduced pre-tax profits in our projections by 3% of sales for every year to account for unusual items, e.g. impairment losses, just to be extra conservative. This yields implicit compounded annual growth assumptions of 2.6% for sales over the next nine years, and negative 2.5% for unlevered free cash flows. The result is an equity value of $28.42 billion, or $89.56 per share. Ex-buyback Growth Value is $61.20.Before we move on, we'd like to point out that STX closed yesterday at $53.87 per share.The gap between Net Assets and Stagnation is a clear demonstration of the enormous economic moat possessed by Seagate Technology PLC. That it is so close to the market price indicates that the growth premium being offered by Mr. Market is quite low, and it does not seem appropriate given the fundamentals achieved in the past.The two-stage DCF H-Model used to produce our estimated intrinsic value shows that the market is selling Seagate Technology PLC at an amazing 40% discount to intrinsic value and implies a potential upside of nearly 66% over the long run. However, we note that this depends on Seagate Technology restoring even some growth after FY 2019, and we believe any future increases in both capital expenditures and R&D expenses - as a percentage of sales - would be excellent indirect signs of improvement in this arena. As we said earlier, given the questionable growth prospects of the company, $28.36 of the per-share valuation relies on share repurchases - removing the antidilutive effect chops off the margin of safety down to merely 12%. Still undervalued, but for something to hold for multiple years? Inflation and taxes would eliminate the 13% gains.Next, we take this DCF model and its adjustments and ""reverse-engineer"" our valuation to arrive at the expected growth implied by the market price and Wall Street's price targets for the next 12 to 18 months. As the tables below show, their expectations appear rather pessimistic when compared against the historical record.Source: Saibus ResearchWe at least think there is a fair chance for Seagate to outperform over the next decade to come.STX is currently followed by 27 analysts from large financial institutions on Wall Street, split evenly between buy and neutral. Still, approximately half calling for a buy is much better than less than 20%, which we had seen way back in June 2013.Source: Thomson Reuters, Presentation by Saibus ResearchLastly the range of Wall Street's estimates - from the most bullish to the most bearish - currently stretch from $54 per share to $83 per share. At a market price of $53.87 per share, the risk-return profile being offered by Seagate should be acceptable to many a risk-averse investor.To conclude, we are long Seagate Technology. Business risks are at the moment low-to-moderate, with the medium-term future characterized by stagnation and the longer term obviously uncertain with a few red flags from R&D and CAPEX movements. The potential upside is excellent, but this is mostly due to share repurchases. Yet even without it, the company at least remains undervalued, so loss of capital should not be likely."

Micron blamed their continuing struggles on slow PC sales.Micron is all everyone is talking about, but to me the more interesting story is the flurry of other companies in the field testing new 52-week lows, dragged down by the growing sense of pessimism Micron produced. Today, I want to talk about Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).A look at SeagateSeagate is a market leader in storage products, both for OEM system makers and as a retail provider. They regularly top benchmark lists by most storage metrics, and it is rare indeed that you won't find either Seagate, or Samsung, or most likely both, at the top of any buyer's guide.That's doubly good news for Seagate, which acquired Samsung's hard drive division back in 2011 for $1.375 billion and has made that brand into an important player in the high-end storage market.The PC storage business has gone in some strange directions in the past 10-12 years. During the waning part of the EIDE era, drives capable of more or less maximum speeds were so common that drives became heavily commoditized, with a focus on low costs.The advent of SATA drives and faster interfaces has spurred a new focus on performance, which allowed bigger companies like Seagate and competitor Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) to once again gain an advantage and differentiate themselves in the market.New software relies more and more on fast access storage, and as things like Windows 10 add to the focus on speed, companies like Seagate will continue to benefit from their best-in-class offerings.A look at the businessSeagate has a long track record in the PC storage business, indeed one of the longest. As that business has matured, so too has Seagate's gross margins, which have remained steadily in the mid-20% for the past several years.Dependable margins have meant dependable earnings, and more importantly dependable cash flow. In FY2014, Seagate earning $4.52 per diluted share, and in the first three quarters of FY2015, they have earned another $4.79. Even low-end estimates for the fourth quarter predict in excess of $1 in earnings there, putting their FY2015 PE ratio conservatively under 9.With those good margins and that market leadership position, Seagate understandably trades at a substantial rate to its book value, but that book is still compelling to look at. The $3.19 billion in shareholder equity, as of the most recent quarter, includes $2.6 billion worth of cash and equivalents, a strong position that will allow them flexibility for acquisitions, stock buybacks, or dividend increases.PC sales have been weak throughout that period, and yet Seagate has remained extremely profitable. The release of Windows 10 later this year is expected by many to stabilize, and strengthen the PC market, and it's not uncommon to see these periods of weakness just ahead of the release of a new revision of Microsoft's operating system.While that weakness continues to drag on estimates, it seems that the market's sentiment is unduly impacted by Micron's struggles, some of them technological struggles that frankly have nothing to do with Seagate's business.In this case, pessimism could be our friend, prompting an unwarranted selloff of Seagate stock and providing an opportunity to buy at a discounted price.The dividendThe real story for investors in Seagate is its dividend, now up to a 4.3% yield on a forward basis, and growing steadily in recent years.The substantial growth has transformed Seagate, once primarily a growth investor's stock, into an appealing target for value investors looking for a nice income play.Even in the admittedly weak PC market right now, the current dividend payout ratio is less than half of the company's diluted earnings, allowing them to easily maintain the current level without risk, and to increase it as the mood strikes, or as the market allows.ConclusionLast month, Seagate announced its intention to issue $700 million in long-term debt priced at 4.875%, allowing it to pay off its existing senior notes of 6.875%.It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss the suitability of this debt as an investment, but that Seagate is capable of saving 2% in this manner underscores the strong position the company is in.But there's another reason I point this out: Seagate is yielding over 4.3% on its common stock. If we accept the level of extreme financial stability that both the balance sheet and the low interest rate on the new debt suggest, it is beyond me why the average investor would look at the debt at all, since the common stock has a similar yield and the possibility of substantial return as the stock price recovers from its present lows.While Micron's struggles must inform us on the overall market for component makers, it should not scare us away from others when the price is right. For Seagate, it seems, the price is very much right."
3166616,78265,2015-05-11T18:06:34-04:00,"Seagate offers a very attractive dividend, consistently high return on capital and a history of positive free cash flow.The debt has been growing, but we believe it's not egregious, given that current cash represents 75% of the debt load.The combination of low PE, high return on invested capital and robust dividend can not last forever and we believe investors who buy now will be glad they did.","We believe the market price for Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) is unreasonably low, perhaps reflecting concerns about future growth potential at the firm. Our view is that the very healthy dividend is well protected, the shares are priced inexpensively and are a good buy at the moment.We spent some of our recent vacation re-reading Joel Greenblatt's ""The Little Book That (Still) Beats the Market"" (I know. ""Get a life""). In that work, Greenblatt talks about how investors should seek out companies that have high returns on invested capital and that are priced cheaply in the market. A good example of us putting this investment philosophy into practice was our take on firearm manufacturer Sturm Ruger (NYSE:RGR). Our view in December, as now, is that if you buy enough companies with these characteristics, you'll be rewarded eventually. People may call you crazy, but part of the discipline of investing is to buy good businesses when others are fearful about them. There are always compelling sounding narratives to keep investors away from a particular name, and that's what gives us an attractive price. Sooner or later, the high returns on capital that a given company makes will be rewarded.Some HighlightsIt's with that in mind that we want to talk about Seagate. The most recent quarterly result for Seagate was not particularly good. For instance, revenue was $3.33 billion for the quarter, basically flat (to slightly down) from the same quarter last year.Seagate is suffering (like many US companies) from currency effects. In particular, the demand from Europe was soft, in large measure as a direct result of currency headwinds. As frustrating is the fact that there's very little visibility into when the European situation will reverse itself.This underwhelming performance has happened in spite of the need for increased demand for storage solutions. The market may (be right to) ask: if this robust demand can't drive net income higher, what will? We believe no market, however much it's set to grow, does so in a straight line. The fact that the market is disappointed by Seagate's results provides opportunity for more patient investors.Some PositivesThis is a company that has a history of consistently making positive (albeit somewhat volatile) free cash flow. In addition, their return on invested capital has risen nicely, indicating to us that they're becoming more efficient at squeezing cash flow out of the capital used by this company.Source: GurufocusAlso, the dividend is currently set to yield more than 3.5%, and the payout ratio is somewhere in the neighborhood of .35, so we consider it fairly safe.The long-term trend in data growth, big data analytics and cloud computing are still in place and auger well for Seagate (and its competitors). We can't see anything on the horizon that would endanger the viability of this business. The marketplace is fairly competitive, but if an investor steps back from the quarterly view, they'll note the high levels of growth here still.As of the most recent quarter, the company has returned in the neighborhood of $882 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and since January. The company has retired 5% of common shares outstanding. The fact that the company is a buyer of its own stock at these prices gives us further confidence in the future of Seagate.Risks: The Capital StructureWe believe the company is viable long term, obviously, but there are risks present. Of particular concern to us is the relatively high debt loads at the firm. That said, the debt level is certainly manageable, with an interest coverage of 11.42. Cash at $2.61 billion represents 75% of long-term debt of $3.457 billion. The company has some flexibility to pay down much of this debt with cash, but we'll keep an eye on interest expense going forward.Source: GurufocusConclusionWe believe investors need to take a longer term view of Seagate. The dividend is well protected, the long-term growth potential for the company is quite good and it's trading at an inexpensive price. We believe this represents a discount to fair value. We can't say when this discount will be eliminated with a higher stock price, but we are confident it will happen. In the meantime, investors are rewarded to wait with a 3.5% dividend yield."
3076506,24663,2015-04-16T18:35:56-04:00,"BofA recently said to buy WDC and STX ahead of earnings.The call was valuation related, as STX and WDC present value that's rarely seen in today's market.While it's hard to predict how a stock will behave after earnings, one chart proves why long term both stocks should go higher.","Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) made a valuation call on Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) earlier this week, suggesting to buy ahead of earnings due to PC weakness being priced accordingly and both stocks being cheap. The following chart proves that BofA is likely right in its analysis.Retail investors like to look at P/E ratios as a favorite valuation metric for analysis. However, free cash flow is where the identification of true value lies. A company can't manipulate FCF, it can't be inaccurately represented with one-time profit-creating events. Instead, FCF shows investors just how much money a company is creating after subtracting its capital investments.That's why it is so impressive that Seagate and Western Digital trade at 7.7 and 12.7 times FCF respectively. That said, I am not trying to predict whether or not either stock will trade higher after earnings - Seagate reports Friday - but rather that both stocks present long-term value right now.Certainly, the PC market is weak, with shipments falling 6.7% during the first quarter. However, Seagate and Western Digital have both done good at making investments in storage solutions that are non-PC related. These are two companies that earned just about all of their revenue from PC sales five years ago, but that percentage has fallen to just 50%.While Western Digital has done better at investing in solid-state drives over the last couple years, both companies are heavily exposed to high-capacity cloud drives and in data centers. Due to Seagate's insanely low FCF multiple, I peg it as the stock to own - Seagate is also one of the most shareholder-friendly companies in the market - but as explained in a recent article, it's not a bad idea to own both stocks. In other words, I agree that Western Digital and Seagate are a buy ahead of earnings, not because of an earnings day pop though, but rather an attractive valuation that should yield large returns long term."
3070226,76475,2015-04-15T16:42:03-04:00,"Seagate Technology has traditionally enjoyed a bigger slice of the HDD market than its biggest rival Western Digital.This has, however, been changing, perhaps due to Western Digital's new helium drives.Western Digital said that its up and coming 10TB helium drive will be the cheapest in the market on a cost-per-gigabyte basis, which might hurt Seagate even further.","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) are the two leading hard disk drive, or HDD, manufacturers, controlling about 85% of the HDD market estimated to be worth more than $30 billion. Both companies are facing a steady onslaught from SSDs, or solid-state drives, which are increasingly finding their way into enterprises, data centers and even client applications. Gartner estimates that the $11 billion SSD market will grow at 40% CAGR through 2018 compared with just 2.9% CAGR for HDDs. Seagate Technology registered a 4.6% revenue decline in fiscal 2014 while Western Digital recorded a 1.9% decline.Even though Western Digital is more dominant in the U.S. in terms of market compared to Seagate Technology, it has frequently played second-fiddle to Seagate in overall market share. Seagate has often had a wider product portfolio than Western Digital that has helped it exploit a wider market and many more price points, not to mention that it's frequently been able to manufacture drives at a lower cost-per-gigabyte than its rival. For instance, Seagate has 8TB, 6TB, 4TB, 3TB and 1.5TB drives, whereas Western Digital has only 6TB, 3TB and 1TB drives.But, the tables have been turning lately, with Western Digital's market share growing while Seagate has been losing its share.What's going on behind the scenes?In 2012, Seagate Technology had a 48% market share compared to 43% for Western Digital. By the beginning of 2015, however, Western Digital's market share had grown to 46% while Seagate Technology's had fallen to just 39%.There are a number of possible explanations behind this phenomenon. I believe one of the most plausible is the launch of the industry's first helium-filled drive by HGST, a subsidiary of Western Digital, in November of 2013. After more than a decade of unsuccessfully trying to figure a way to reliably seal helium inside a hard-disk drive, HGST finally succeeded in manufacturing a 6TB 3.5-inch drive that consumed 23% less power and was 38% lighter than 4TB drives, which back then were the highest capacity drives in the market.Helium-filled drives come with major advantages over conventional air-filled drives. Helium is much lighter than air, having just 1/7th the density of air. Being less dense makes helium far less viscous as a fluid, which imposes less drag on spinning disks and head actuators. Less drag in turn means less platter vibration. This smoother operation allows disk platters to be stacked closer together - a typical helium drive contains 7 platters compared to 5 in the conventional air-filled drive. This means more data can be packed in the same space on a helium drive than an air drive.Air-filled Drives vs. Helium-filled drivesSource: ComputerworldBut, perhaps one of the biggest selling points for helium drives is that they are hermetically sealed, making them 100% water resistant and can therefore be cooled using water, which is not possible with air-filled drives. These makes helium drives ideal for large data center applications, where servers are usually located near large water sources for cooling purposes. The lower power consumption of helium drives means that they heat much less than air drives and require less cooling.HGST launches ultra-cheap 10TB Helium DriveHGST followed up about a year later by launching an 8TB helium drive in September last year. Western Digital enjoyed having the highest-capacity and most advanced hard disk drive in the market for little more than a year before Seagate Technology countered by launching the industry's cheapest drive - an 8TB shingled magnetic recording, or SMR, disk in late 2014. The ultra-cheap drive cost just $260, much lower than the $700 that Western Digital charges for its 8TB helium drive. The price disparity is huge, and would probably have helped Seagate Technology to recapture some of the market share it had lost to its rival. One of the main reasons why Seagate has traditionally held pole position in HDD market share lies in the company's ability to manufacture low-cost drives compared to Western Digital (though it appears it compromises on quality as we shall see later).The huge price disparity would most likely have helped Seagate to recapture the market share it had lost to its rival, only that around the same time it unveiled its new drive, Western Digital unveiled a 10TB SMR helium-filled drive that it says is going to be the industry's cheapest on a cost-per-gigabyte basis and also feature the lowest power consumption per gigabyte. Now that would be truly amazing by the company. Further, Western Digital added that it planned to exclusively produce 100% helium drives by 2018.If Western Digital's claims about the cost per gigabyte of its 10TB helium drive being the lowest in the industry turn out to be true, then I suspect that the company will either be pricing the product near its cost of production or even below it primarily to maintain its lead against Seagate Technology. For the 10TB drive to be the cheapest in the market, it will have to sell for less than $325, which is what Seagate's 8TB drive would sell for assuming it ramped up its capacity to 10TB. This in effect means that Western Digital will be selling its 10TB helium drive for less than half the cost of its 8TB drive.It's possible that Western Digital's 8TB drive was selling at a huge profit margin, and the 10TB will merely lower the margin. Western Digital is the only company with helium drives in the market at the moment. Companies that are first to market with high-tech products almost invariably charge huge margins for the products as they try to quickly recoup their development costs. It could also mean that Western Digital is willing to sell its 10TB drive at a loss to maintain market share against Seagate Technology. This could be the beginning of a big race to the bottom.This also means that Seagate Technology is left with no real advantage over Western Digital at the higher end of the market. For one, Western Digital drives have a reputation of being much more reliable than Seagate Technology drives and are less prone to breaking down. Backblaze, the unlimited online backup company, has been carrying out a series of tests on hard disk drives from different manufacturers to determine their reliability. The company leaves the disks spinning for years on end and records their failure rate. HGST and Western Digital drives were found to have a much lower failure rate than Seagate Technology drives.Source: Extreme TechWith Western Digital's high-end drives being so competitively priced, I expect that they will rapidly gain traction in the data center. Gartner had earlier predicted that the market for helium-filled drives will grow much faster than that of conventional HDDs - 25.1% CAGR through 2018 vs. 2.9% for conventional drives. SSDs are still roughly 5-6 times more expensive than HDDs on a cost-per-gigabyte basis. Unless the upcoming 3D NAND SSDs by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) upset the price dynamics for Western Digital, I think the company has an excellent chance to revive its flagging fortunes.Meanwhile, Seagate Technology is not in a very enviable position at the moment. The company has not revealed its helium HDD roadmap, so we cannot tell what tricks it has up its sleeves. This is a space that is worth watching."
3083436,24757,2015-04-20T16:33:46-04:00,"Seagate may benefit from increased global data storage needs.In the March quarter, cloud demand could not offset PC demand decline.At the current price Seagate is good for dividend investors.","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is a maker of HDD (hard disk drive), SDD (solid state drive) and hybrid data storage devices. Seagate has done a great job returning cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, but it is working in a technology market segment where growth can be hard to come by.March Quarter ResultsAfter the release of Seagate's March quarter (fiscal Q3 2015) data before the market opened last Friday, the stock had a good day, closing at $57.43, up $1.27 during the day. Yet STX had hit a 52-week high of $69.40 back on December 23, 2014. Seagate reported a better quarter than many analysts had projected. But it was not a good quarter, and the following price rise does not indicate long-term strength. Rather, data for the quarter is reassuring that the industry is not collapsing and the dividend should be safe for quite some time.Revenue in the quarter was $3.33 billion, which is sequentially down 10% from $3.70 billion, within the normal range of seasonality. But it was down 2% from the year-earlier quarter. Perhaps that's within the realm of normal statistical fluctuation, but it screams stagnation, not growth.Net income was $291 million using GAAP, but $357 million non-GAAP. The GAAP number is down 26% y/y. The non-GAAP number is down 21% y/y. EPS was down about the same, to $0.88 GAAP and $1.08 non-GAAP.Specific to the quarter, Seagate reported that the market was weaker than expected, particularly in Europe, where in addition to the long-term malaise the exchange rate has hurt demand in units and dollars. Global weakness was mainly in units shipped with or sold for PCs. Cloud and datacenter demand held up well.Cash ended at $2.6 billion, with operating cash flow of $374 million and free cash flow of $215 million. But there's long-term debt of $3.9 billion. Despite the debt, cash returned to shareholders in the quarter included $176 million in dividends and $706 million in share repurchases.Data Storage TrendsIt is important to understand that this flattish revenue and down EPS is occurring while the need for data storage is growing rapidly. The problem is the hyper-competition with Seagate's main rival, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). Both companies are rapidly introducing new technologies that allow more data to be put on a drive, driving down the cost per unit of data. So despite large amounts of video being stored in the cloud and in client devices, on a dollar basis annual demand is hovering near flat.If the ability to increase data density on drives were to slow, that would be a long-term positive for both Seagate and Western Digital. On the other hand, my sense is that it is just as likely that cloud and client demand for storage space will slow at some point, leading to a further decline in the HDD industry.The DividendThe dividend of $0.54 per share will be payable on May 15 to shareholders of record on May 1. At Friday's closing price that worked out to 3.76% per share annually. That is a great return and it looks solid for years to come, given how operating cash flow exceeds the dividend payment.ConclusionI bought STX in 2012 at $23.13 per share, but my thesis was different then. Many analysts believed SSDs would wipe out HDDs in short order, leading to Seagate and Western Digital being wiped out. I looked at reality and decided that those analysts were wrong. I thought that if HDDs declined it would be gradual and that the HDD makers also would become major SSD players.I called that correctly, but sold my STX shares in 2014 for an average of $59.45 per share. My analysis had not changed - the share price had. I like dividends, but I am ambitious enough to set goals of not just beating the S&P, but of beating the iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB). That requires that an undervalued stock I buy bounces up to a realistic value, or that I buy into growth stocks where the market is not fully appreciating future growth.In other words, I thought there was alpha available in STX in 2012. Now there's just the dividend. It is a great dividend, way better than is available from U.S. government bonds, and with some up-side potential if data storage demand grows faster than expected.I do own one storage company: Dot Hill (NASDAQ:HILL). As a microcap Dot Hill is riskier than Seagate, but it has been on a roll lately. Most recently it announced major extensions of partnerships with Quantum (NYSE:QTM-OLD) and Teradata (NYSE:TDC) and is guiding toward a good Q1 showing y/y growth. HILL pays no dividend, has a lot more risk and is emerging from hard times. If you want alpha, that's the sort of play where it might be found."

        Seagate is a large-cap provider of data storage solutions to enterprise and customer-level businesses.
        Management plans on increasing dividends by 10% in 2015 and 2016.","Even when broader valuations appear too high to bother, often times there are still well-known, solid, dividend-paying businesses out there trading at a reasonable valuation. Today the S&P 500 index trades at over 20 times trailing earnings; well above the S&P 500 average of 15.5 times earnings. Even sill, over the past few weeks I've highlighted several high-quality dividend-paying businesses trading at reasonable prices. Today I'd like to share another reasonably-valued dividend payer: Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).Seagate is a technology company that provides hardware-based data storage solutions to enterprise and retail customers. Seagate is an 'old tech' company in the cash cow stage of its business life (in my opinion). Seagate is a large-cap company with a market cap of over $16 billion. As Seagate matures, I believe the company's free cash flow situation will improve significantly, and therefore I believe that Seagate could be a very good dividend investment right here. This article will take a look at Seagate's business, its valuation, and finally its dividend prospects going forward.FundamentalsSeagate is a well-established business in a mature tech-based industry. While memory and storage may seem to have low barriers of entry, this space is comprised of three big players: Seagate, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Samsung. At this point it would be difficult to match the scale and expertise of these three data storage players. Even with the cloud, all companies must ultimately store their data somewhere physically, so the need for Seagate's services should be around for a long time to come, although in the tech sector it is rarely wise to coast along because there is always the possibility of disruptive technology.Data by MorningstarMeanwhile, revenue has slowly increased over the last few years, through a combination of organic growth and small acquisitions. Prior long-term guidance was for 3%-5% revenue growth going forward. However, last quarter, management bumped that estimate up to 5%-7%. As for earnings, according to data from FAST Graphs, Wall St. expects earnings growth of about 4% per year.Data by MorningstarHowever, the real potential here is in both dividends and buybacks. Like many mature businesses, capital spending needs are leveling off, allowing management to channel more funds to dividends and buybacks. Over the past five years Seagate has repurchased about half the entire company's share count, and I expect at least some buybacks to continue. Management is committed to at least 10% dividend growth year-on-year until 2017. Considering the dividend yield is already 4.1% at this time, I believe Seagate has potential to be a significant income investment if picked up right here.FAST Graphs. Earnings depicted by shaded green area bounded by orange line. Average price to earnings ratio depicted by solid blue line.Taking a look at FAST Graphs, notice that Seagate is at its lowest valuation in eighteen months or so, when going by price to earnings. Seagate on average trades at 10.7 times earnings and now Seagate trades at 11.1 times earnings. Although Seagate is still trading slightly above its ten-year average P/E, I believe that Seagate is a good bargain at just 11.1 times trailing earnings, especially when we consider the forecasted revenue, earnings and dividend growth.Because Seagate is already trading slightly above its average P/E ratio, it is difficult to precisely define the upside, but I believe that twelve times trailing earnings is a reasonable, if arbitrary, valuation. That would give me a price target of $61.20 based on full-year 2015 earnings expectations. That price is 18.4% higher than where prices are today. That does not include the current 4.1% dividend.ConclusionSeagate is a solid company in a mature industry. In my opinion, Seagate has significant dividend upside as the need for capital expenditure should cool off. Therefore, I believe that Seagate has the potential to be a terrific dividend play in the coming years."
3048406,23479,2015-04-02T14:52:44-04:00,"We forecast Seagate’s laptop HDD units to rise from 73 million units in 2014 to about 79 million by 2017 and then gradually decline to under 75 million through the end of the decade.We currently forecast desktop hard drives shipped by Seagate to decline from about 73 million units in 2014 to 62 million units by the end of our forecast period.We have a $58 price estimate for Seagate, which is about 10% higher than the current market price.","Hard drive manufacturer Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has witnessed a tough environment for PC and laptop hard drive sales in the last few years owing to weak global IT spend and declining PC/laptop shipments. A large chunk of the desktop and laptop market has been cannibalized by the penetration of smartphones and tablets, which use flash-storage instead of traditional spinning disk hard drives. However, the penetration of SSDs in the consumer market is still limited, with hybrid drives (SSD-based cache memory coupled with standard hard drives) gaining popularity. As a result, we expect hard drive manufacturers including Seagate and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) to continue to reap benefits in the PC and Laptop storage market in the coming years.On the other hand, enterprise customers have switched over to flash-based storage at a much faster rate than individual end-users, since the requirement of high-end storage is more apparent for cloud storage or in data centers. The prices of flash storage have declined significantly over the last few years driven by significant demand. Although prices for SSDs are expected to continue to fall, they still likely won’t be as cheap as HDDs in the next few years. As a result, Seagate and Western Digital have focused on cheaper alternates to flash storage for enterprise and cloud customers with innovative products such as helium-filled drives and the Kinetic Open Storage Platform. These products are still in nascent stages, and the success of these alternates to SSDs would depend on the long-term customer response.There is still some uncertainty around the rate of adoption of Seagate’s products and popularity among the end-users or enterprises, which suggests that there is room for stock price movement depending on how the results turn out in the few years. Below we look at a few potential scenarios, and the potential impact on the company’s stock price. PCs Switch To SSDs Sooner Than Expected (-10% Stock Price Impact)Seagate has often downplayed the importance of pure SSDs (especially in the consumer market) in the past and focused on alternatives such as hybrid drives that use flash-based storage as cache memory riding on top of a HDD. The company did not bet big on SSDs mainly because they are not cheap enough to attract volumes. Moreover, with the current rate of decline of SSD prices, manufacturing them at a mass scale does not currently seem like a viable option. As a result, the company is focused on delivering solid state hybrid drives (SSHD) and cheaper traditional spinning disk hard drives in the consumer market. As a result, we forecast Seagate’s laptop HDD units (including both SSHD and HDD) to rise from 73 million units in 2014 to about 79 million by 2017 and then gradually decline to under 75 million through the end of the decade. We expect unit shipments to decline post-2017 since SSDs will eventually start becoming adopted on a larger scale.Similarly, we currently forecast desktop hard drives shipped by Seagate to decline from about 73 million units in 2014 to 62 million units by the end of our forecast period. This decline corresponds to IDC’s forecast for falling global PC shipments. Additionally, as SSDs become more relevant in the consumer market, the unit shipments for SSHDs and traditional HDDs are likely to suffer even more. If the industry-wide adoption of pure SSDs happens sooner than anticipated, the decline in PC and laptop HDDs could be steeper for hard drive manufacturers. This is also likely to reduce average selling prices for HDDs and put pressure on margins. If desktop and laptop HDD units shipped by Seagate decline to 55 million and 63 million units, respectively, the average selling price per unit falls by about 5-6% per unit and the adjusted gross margin for the PC and Laptop division is compressed by just over a percentage point through the end of the decade, there could be a 10% discount to our price estimate for the company.Enterprise And Cloud Storage Switches To SSD Alternatives (+10% Impact) Seagate’s enterprise storage division caters to businesses and institutional clients, with its storage products designed for mission critical and nearline applications. The market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions has grown at a rapid pace over the last few years, as cloud-based storage has shifted consumers away from storing data locally. Additionally, the number of data centers which need to maintain backups of data and information on servers, and the number of large businesses that require high-end data storage, have risen significantly over the years. Accordingly, enterprise-grade hard drives are manufactured to withstand high workloads and deliver optimum performance for long periods of time. However, flash-based or SSD storage is increasingly becoming an integral part of data centers or cloud storage.SSDs have various advantages over spinning disk HDDs such as better performance, low latency, higher durability, less vulnerability to mechanical shock, less power consumption and lower cooling requirements. As a result, SSDs and all-flash arrays are increasingly becoming the preferred option for enterprises and data centers. Needless to say, the price per GB for SSDs is still significantly higher than HDDs. To bridge the price gap, Seagate has introduced cheaper alternatives to SSDs such as shingled magnetic recording (SMR) drives, the Kinetic Open Storage Platform and heat-assisted laser drives.We currently forecast Seagate’s enterprise and cloud storage unit shipments to rise from 33 million units in 2014 to 55 million units, and the average price per unit to increase from $124 per unit to $138 per unit by the end of our forecast period. If the alternatives to SSDs play a key role in the coming years and gain popularity among enterprise clients, it could boost product sales for Seagate. If the unit shipments rise to about 64 million units, with the average selling price rising to about $150 through the end of our forecast period, there could be a 10% upside to our price estimate for the company.We have a $58 price estimate for Seagate, which is about 10% higher than the current market price.Disclosure: None"
3053866,58481,2015-04-07T19:00:27-04:00,"Seagate has fallen more than 20% YTD due to negative sentiment on its core business.The company still has increasing revenue and extremely strong fundamentals.Investors looking for a good contrarian pick should look no further than Seagate, which generates tons of cash and has a history of returning value to shareholders.","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is an out-of-favor stock that has fallen roughly 20% so far in 2015. A combination of declining PC and laptop sales and a gradual shift away from HDD to SSD has given investors a negative view of the long-term viability of the company. However, Seagate is still one of the dominant players in the massive HDD market, operates extremely efficiently, generates tremendous free cash flow, and is shareholder friendly. As a result, Seagate has the potential to be a decent contrarian pick at current levels.ValuationIt's becoming increasingly difficult to find undervalued stocks in the market, but I believe at $52/share, Seagate has decent upside potential with good downside protection. With a P/E of just 8.7, Seagate trades at less than half the value of the S&P 500, which has a trailing P/E of 17.7. Given the fact that revenue has grown 6.6% in the first six months of FY 2015 and gross margins have stayed over 28%, the low valuation is discounting the company's strong operating strengths and ignoring the value being returned to shareholders.STX data by YChartsLooking back over the past 16 months, you can see Seagate has established a floor around $50/share. This has occurred for two reasons. When the stock dips down to $50, the dividend yield increases to 4.3%, which brings in dividend investors, and the company opportunistically buys back shares. Over the past five years, the company has effectively removed more than 30% of all outstanding shares. In the previous conference calls, management has repeatedly stated it would opportunistically repurchase shares under $60. In FY 2013, 54 million shares were repurchased and another 41 million in FY 2014. Through the first six months of FY 2015 (June 2014-December 2014), only 3 million shares have been repurchased due in part because the stock has traded above $60 for much of the reported FY. With the steep decline in price since late February, it's likely the company will step up its buyback program in the back half of the fiscal year.STX Shares Outstanding data by YChartsDividendSTX Dividend data by YChartsOn October 14, 2014, Seagate received a partial payment of $773 million from a judgment against Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). Management stated a portion of this money would be returned to shareholders through dividends. The company has followed through by increasing the quarterly dividend 26% to $0.54. This dividend increase follows previous increases of 13% and 19% over the last two years. In fact, since the company reinstated its dividend in 2011, the quarterly dividend has a 31.6% CAGR. This impressive growth has given the stock a forward yield of 4.1%. Management expects to continue to increase the dividend on an annual basis by at least 10%. This gives an already attractive yield further upside for dividend growth investors. The most important part of Seagate's dividend is the company can easily cover continued increases through its free cash flow.Free Cash FlowSTX Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsOne of the best ways to get an accurate view of the health of any company is to look at its free cash flow. Free cash flow gives a company the flexibility to pay down debt, acquire other firms, increase dividends and buy back shares. Seagate generates a tremendous amount of FCF. During FY 2014, the company generated $2 billion in FCF, and through the first six months of FY 2015, has generated nearly $900 million, excluding the $773 million partial payment from Western Digital in October 2014. This gives the stock a trailing twelve-month FCF yield of 13.6%. This is a remarkable number that puts the company ahead of many of the other well-established major tech companies that are known cash cows, such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).STX Free Cash Flow Yield (TTM) data by YChartsBecause of Seagate's ability to generate FCF, it has allowed the company to significantly increase its dividend payments over the past several years, remove more than 30% of outstanding shares over the past five years, and obtain a Baa3 rating with a stable outlook from Moody's. With the dividend accounting for less than 30% of FCF, it should also give dividend investors the confidence in the company's ability to maintain and increase payouts on a consistent basis.TakeawaySeagate's dependence on PC and laptop sales, as well as mounting pressure from increased adoption of SSDs, has led to the stock falling 20% YTD. While this is a serious issue and may eventually lead to declining revenues down the road, I believe investors can benefit in the short-to-medium term (1-3 years) on this undervalued stock. Because the shift away from PCs to tablets and mobile devices will continue to present a problem for the majority of Seagate's revenue, I don't believe the company is a buy-and-hold-forever stock. Rather, investors have the opportunity to buy a mispriced stock with solid fundamentals and a safe 4.1% dividend yield and wait for a positive catalyst that its FCF can bring. While I'm not convinced Seagate can rely on HHD sales 10 years down the road, I do see the company being able to capitalize on its market dominance over the next couple years, which can bring 20% upside to shareholders while enjoying a 4+% yield.Management has stated its intentions to repurchase shares under $60/share. Its ability to remove over 30% of outstanding shares in a short time period illustrates just how committed management is to this process. With a strong level of resistance being built into the stock around $50/share, investors have the ability to buy near a 52-week low and wait for a turnaround. Over the next 12 months, I believe the stock will appreciate to around $60-$65 based on its significant discount to the overall market and the company's ability to continue to generate tremendous amounts of cash from its established HHD sales. A 20% appreciation would bring the P/E to just over 10, its FCF yield still over 10%, and put the stock at a modest $62/share. Looking at the consensus price target of $63.56 from the 22 analysts following the stock, a 20% increase in Seagate shares isn't a stretch to say the least. When an out-of-favor established company still has the ability to generate huge amounts of cash and has a strong track record of returning that cash to shareholders, it's an easy way to make money off of contrarian investing."
2856926,27231,2015-01-28T04:21:59-05:00,"Seagate’s dividend yield is 3.78% and its quarterly dividend per share has tripled since 2011.
        Seagate's adjusted dividend payout ratio is only 42% which enables Seagate to meet our expectations for 5% annual long-term dividend growth.
        Seagate's dividend yield is well above the S&P 500 and its closest competitor Western Digital.
        Seagate repurchased $5.3B worth of its shares since the end of 2011, but we don't expect significant buybacks in the future.
        We expect that dividends will be the only source of near-term return for Seagate investors.","Seagate Technology's (STX) shares have more than sextupled since the October 2011 flood at Western Digital's (WDC) Thailand factory and because it returned over $7B through dividends and share repurchases since FY 2011. Seagate's dividend yield of 3.78% is more than double the yield on the S&P 500 and its closest competitor Western Digital and its adjusted dividend payout ratio is only 42%. We believe that based on Seagate's current dividend payout ratio, it can maintain and increase its dividends by a low to mid-single digit rate of growth even if its EPS stagnates or declines. However, we believe that due to softening revenue projections from its European operations, investors should consider taking their profits in Seagate as we do not expect much in the way of revenue, EPS or dividend growth.Source: Morningstar DirectFINANCIAL POSITION AND DIVIDEND SUSTAINABILITYSeagate has a solid financial position, which would enable it to continue increasing its dividend. Seagate's $3.3B in cash and marketable investment securities nearly offsets its $3.9B in outstanding debt. Seagate's shareholder equity (book value) of $3.7B is almost equal to the book value of its outstanding debt ($3.9B). Seagate has taken advantage of the improved industry economics to reward its shareholders; it repurchased $5.3B in shares net of share issuances during the last 3.5 years and paid $1.8B in dividends to shareholders. Seagate has over $1.5B in gross deferred tax assets after accounting for deferred tax liabilities, but excluding a $0.9B valuation allowance. For the purposes of conservatism, we are assuming that Seagate does not increase its use of financial leverage in order to defend the dividend. We also do not expect significant share repurchases as we expect Seagate will focus on rewarding shareholders through steady dividend increases.Source: Morningstar DirectSeagate's tax valuation allowance is due to the company's assessment that it may not potentially utilize a significant portion of its deferred tax assets that were created because of operating loss carryforwards. We expect Seagate to utilize these tax assets over the next nine years, and afterwards incur a 10% average tax rate going forward. We also believe that Seagate's ability to utilize its operating loss carryforwards against future taxable income is another catalyst that will help Seagate maintain or grow its dividend going forward. We expect Seagate to utilize approximately $100M of its deferred tax assets annually going forward, which helps sustain $.30/share of its annual dividend.We have already established that Seagate has a higher dividend yield than Western Digital. Seagate has a higher dividend per share payout than Western Digital even though it has less earnings per share than Western Digital. Seagate's annualized adjusted dividend payout ratio is 42%, which is well above Western Digital's 19.44%. Then again, Seagate has had a nine-year head start in establishing its dividend program relative to Western Digital. Western Digital initiated its first quarterly dividend in September 2012 ($.25/share) and boosted it by 20% in 2013 and 25% in 2014. We expect Western Digital to increase its dividend by at least 20% annually for the next four years in order to enable its yield and payout ratio to catch up to Seagate's yield and payout ratio while we expect Seagate to increase its dividend by 5% for the following reasons:With the exception of a three-year period from November 2008 to April 2011 in which the dividend was eliminated, Seagate's dividend history grew at a strong rate since it came back to the public markets in late 2002. We found it interesting when Seagate restored its dividend in 2011, its quarterly dividend per share of $.18 was 50% higher than its quarterly dividend in 2008. We believe that Microsoft initiating a dividend in 2003 served as a catalyst for Seagate to initiate a dividend on its shares three weeks later. Seagate's annualized payout ratio for its initial dividend in 2003 was 9% and its strong dividend growth through the years has pushed it up to 42% on an adjusted basis. We believe that future dividend growth will be due to a steadily increasing payout ratio because we do not expect much in the way of EPS growth for Seagate.Source: Seagate Investor Relations and Our EstimatesRECENT QUARTERSeagate generated underwhelming results during its most recent quarter, part of which were boosted by the incremental contributions from the acquisitions of Xyratex and LSI Corporation's Accelerated Solutions Division and Flash Components Division. Seagate's year-over-year revenue grew by 4.76% during the quarter and 6.6% during the first six months. Seagate' gross margin rate decreased slightly but growth in its operating expenses resulted in its adjusted operating income decreasing by 2.5% during the quarter and 3.6% during H1 2015. Seagate's reported results included $724M in non-recurring pre-tax gains associated with an arbitration award from the company's case against Western Digital. Seagate's adjusted EPS grew incrementally in Q2 2015 and H1 2015 as the reduction in shares from its share buybacks more than offset declines in its adjusted net income. Western Digital also saw unremarkable results in its most recent quarterly period as its adjusted net income only grew by 3%, primarily due to share repurchases.Source: Morningstar DirectSEAGATE'S FORWARD FORECASTSCONCLUSIONIn conclusion, we like that Seagate sports a 3.78% dividend yield, which is significantly higher than the yield on Western Digital and the S&P 500. We expect Seagate to maintain or incrementally grow the dividend going forward as its payout ratio is only 42% of its adjusted EPS. However, investors in Seagate should not expect a repeat of the last three and a half years because we expect its operating margins will stagnate or decline over the next few years. Seagate has tripled its dividend over the last four years (31.6% CAGR rate) and we believe that its dividend growth rate will be in the low to mid-single digit rate over the next four years as the company's EPS stagnates. As such, we believe that Seagate's dividend will be the only source of return for Seagate investors in the near term and we think that Seagate investors may want to consider taking their profits and redeploying them elsewhere.Source: Seagate Investor Relations and Our Estimates"
2970946,24663,2015-03-04T23:19:12-05:00,"BofA initiated coverage on STX with an Underperform rating and $50 price target.BofA noted all of the potential headwinds for STX, but failed to mention the company's success at dealing with adversity, or the high-margin nature of its business.It's these margins that allow STX to be one of the most shareholder-friendly companies in the market, which in itself makes STX a good buying opportunity.","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) was given an Underperform rating and $50 price target by BofA, on what was a purely fundamental call. The firm correctly noted that Seagate has high exposure to PCs, and that the solid state drive industry is beginning to face cannibalization. However, the firm also forgot to note that the hard disk drive (HDD) giant survived a near PC collapse when tablets were introduced, and has shifted its total shipments from almost entirely PC-related to just sub-50% over the last six years. In other words, Seagate has faced adversity before, has always overcome those obstacles, and for the most part, remains a very solid company with high margins. Nevertheless, Seagate is also a great stock due to its capital return program, and since it can easily afford to be shareholder friendly, its chances of significant stock losses from this point are unlikely.STX Total Dividends Paid (TTM) data by YChartsSeagate has spent over $900 million during the last 12 months on stock buybacks and dividends. Yet the company still managed to profit $1.5 billion in free cash flow. This is relevant because it shows Seagate is still a highly profitable company with the ability for further increases to capital return programs, all the while still paying a dividend yield of 3.5% and allowing its buybacks to have a profound effect on the stock.STX data by YChartsIn five years Seagate Technology has reduced its share count by well over 30%. As seen above, this reduction in share count has allowed its stock price to significantly outperform its stock price during this period, by more than 100%. This illustrates the outcome of effective buybacks, something Seagate has executed to perfection to compliment its 3.5% yield. Thus, the effect of its buybacks, its high dividend, and the large free cash flow profits remaining after returning capital to shareholders all suggest that Seagate Technology has a very stable, high profit business.STX P/E Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsAll things considered, the fact that BofA downgraded the stock to Underperform despite these noted strengths is quite surprising. Not to mention, Seagate is very cheap, trading at under 11 times forward earnings, meaning that even if there are some minor fundamental headwinds, Seagate is in no way priced for significant stock losses. In retrospect, Seagate is a great stock to own, and its recent stock losses only make it that much better."

The company reported revenue slightly below analysts' expectations and EPS in line with consensus. However, Seagate's forecast for the current quarter's revenue, which was below expectations disappointed investors. As a result, Seagate's stock dropped 7.69% on the same day, and another 3.37% the day after (Seagate reported before the market open). In my opinion, the retreat in its stock price offers an excellent opportunity for a long-term investment in STX's stock at a relatively cheap price.On November 4, I wrote an article recommending Seagate shares. In this article, I will give some update information about the stock.In a conference call with analysts on January 26, chairman & CEO Steve Luczo, elaborated on the company's outlook.Seagate Technology is mainly a hard disk drive provider. In fact, about 93.9% of its revenue in Q2'15 came from HDD. SSD-related revenue of about $220 million in the quarter, while very encouraging, accounted for only about 6.1% of total revenue.Some investors believe that hard disk drives will be replaced by solid state drives in most applications, and, therefore, have a negative idea about Seagate's growth prospects. However, examining the real market data, we can see that the demand for HDD remains strong since it is a much cheaper storage. As a matter of fact, world total available market - TAM for HDD has increased 6.6% from 136 million in Q2'13 to 145 million in Q2'15. According to Seagate, its market share has not changed during the last two years and remains at 40%. In addition, HDD unit average selling price has remained almost constant during the last two years between $60 to $63 per unit. However, the average capacity per drive has increased 31% from 823 GB in Q2'13 to 1,077 GB in Q2'15.Planning ahead, Seagate is building a non-HDD revenue, which primarily includes the Xyratex systems business, the LSI Flash Components Division acquired from Avago, and other assets. Total SSD-related revenue of about $220 million in Q2'15 were much higher than less than $200 million in Q1'15.ValuationSTX's stock has performed very well in 2012 and 2013, gaining 58.4%. However, since the beginning of 2014, the stock is up only 3.4%%, while the S&P 500 index has increased 8.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 11.0%. However, since the start of 2012, STX's stock has gained an astounding 250.8% while the S&P 500 index has increased 59.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 78%. It is worth noting, in the STX weekly chart below, how its 50-week simple moving average acts as a support line since 2012, which suggests a higher price ahead.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.STX's valuation metrics are very good, the forward P/E is very low at 9.88, and the price to free cash flow ratio is also very low at 13.99. Moreover, its PEG ratio is low at 1.06, and its Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is very low at 5.98.According to James P. O'Shaughnessy, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is the best-performing single value factor. In his impressive book ""What Works on Wall Street,"" Mr. O'Shaughnessy demonstrates that 46 years back testing, from 1963 to 2009, have shown that companies with the lowest EV/EBITDA ratio have given the best return.In addition, STX's Efficiency and Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median as shown in the tables below.Source: Portfolio123During the second quarter, the company generated approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow, paid cash dividends of $177 million and repurchased approximately 0.3 million ordinary shares for $18 million.Seagate has been paying dividends since 2003, but had stopped its payments in 2009 and 2010. On October 22, 2014, Seagate increased its quarterly dividend by 26% to $0.54 per common share. The forward annual dividend yield is fairly high at 3.75%, and the payout ratio is only 37.1%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was extremely high at 110%.STX Dividend data by YChartsSummarySeagate will continue to benefit from strong demand for HDD storage and its increasing SSD-related business. In my view, after the retreat in its stock price, it is now an excellent opportunity for a long-term investment in STX's stock at a relatively cheap price. Seagate has compelling valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects. Its Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is very low at 5.98, and its PEG ratio is also low at 1.06. In addition, Seagate is generating strong free cash flows; its price to free cash flow is very low at 13.99, and it returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and increasing dividend payments.

2851906,24757,2015-01-26T22:56:48-05:00,Cash flow and earnings are strong.CEO said buybacks are attractive under $60 per share.Dividends appear to be the preferred way to return cash to shareholders.,"Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX) had a good December 2014 quarter, characterized by extremely high cash generation. Guidance for Q1 2015 and full-year 2015 was about what would be expected of the storage drive industry. While many interesting points were made on the analyst call Monday morning, there was one that was certainly the catalyst for the 7.7% dive in the stock price. The press release was made available at 8:00 AM (Eastern), and the analyst conference took place at 9:00 AM Eastern. The stock hit bottom at $56.52 shortly after 10:00 AM.Seagate reported repurchasing very little stock in Q4, just $18 million worth. Why? CEO Steve Luczo explained that the company is executing buybacks opportunistically. When the stock was below $60 per share, it was a good use of shareholder money.Which implied that above $60 per share, there are better uses for shareholder money, like dividend payments or internal investment. I would agree, but clearly a lot of money was in Seagate stock on the assumption that buybacks would be used to defend or raise the price. It was not a bad assumption. Many companies keep buying back stock once they have announced an allocation of cash for that purpose, no matter what the stock price.And so the stock ended regular trading on January 26 at $59.06, down 7.7% for the day. It is rare that you can see in the charts a result that lines up so nicely with a statement from a company that amounts to saying that the price will be defended with buybacks at a certain level.I think investors are missing the big picture here. Seagate has become a dividend stock, so it does not need defending with buybacks. The dividend is now $2.16 per year, for a yield of 3.38% at Monday's closing price. Given that non-GAAP earnings in the quarter were $1.35 (or $5.40 per year), there is room to accumulate cash and grow the dividend. This high dividend should provide plenty of support for the share price.Given the numbers reported for the December quarter (fiscal Q2) and calendar 2014, the earnings and dividend look dependable.Revenue was $3.70 billion, which was down 2% from the September quarter, but up 5% from $3.53 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Not bad for a company that still makes hard disk drives that a few years ago pundits were claiming would be made obsolete by now (by solid-state drives).GAAP and non-GAAP (adjusted) accounting gave vastly different results in the quarter, mainly due to a $773 million payment from rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), following an arbitration decision. It is a huge chunk of cash, and is included in the GAAP accounting, but says nothing about the long term. So while I generally favor GAAP numbers as more conservative, in this case I'll use the adjusted numbers. Adjusted net income was $452 million, not much different than the $453 reported for the September quarter, or the $455 reported in the year earlier. The resulting adjusted EPS was $1.35, up a tad from the year earlier only because stock buybacks have reduced the share count.What it looks like is a company in stasis or slow growth. Seagate has some growth opportunities and dangers ahead, but no one should be calling it a growth stock. There was some talk of pricing competition in consumer-oriented drives at retail outlets, but also confidence in the growing long-term need for data storage both in the cloud and at the client end.One thing that struck me about the presentation and conference call was a failure to talk about, or even of analysts to ask about, SSDs. After years of analysts only seeming to care if Seagate could get traction in the SSD market, this quarter marked analyst capitulation: Everyone has finally gotten the message that SSDs just can't totally replace HDDs, or even come close, and Seagate's SSD and hybrid drives are competitive with other manufacturers. We are back to questions about slight changes in margins and market share in particular segments, and whether cloud providers or cloud consumers are going to be trending higher or lower in their storage consumption.For guidance, a soft March quarter is predicted, to be followed by sequential increases as calendar 2015 progresses. In other words, not much different than 2014. There should be no problem with cash generation that can support a dividend and investment in the next generation of HDDs, SSDs and hybrid drives. Once the next generation of drives gets to market, the margins should improve.So, hard drives live, and so does Seagate. Cash ended at $3.3 billion. Operating cash flow was $1.4 billion, and would have been about $0.7 billion without the legal settlement. Dividends paid out were $177 million.In the $50-$60 stock range, we can expect Seagate to use cash to buy shares, but not reduce the dividend. Above $60, the dividends could be increased, but in either range cash looks to pile up rapidly.What is not to like? There are the usual macroeconomic and competitive risks every company is subject to. If all the capitalists who talk about the beauty of free markets, but are hiding most of their money under the skirts of U.S. Treasuries would take a look at the STX yield of 3.38%, with even stronger cash generation as a percent of the stock price, I would imagine the stock price will climb again, at least into the mid-to-high 60s."
2845526,23479,2015-01-23T15:17:32-05:00,"Seagate Technology is scheduled to announce its Q2 FY 2015 earnings Monday.The company expects the strong demand for enterprise storage and notebook hard drive units to continue through the fourth calendar year quarter as well.We have a $58 price estimate for Seagate’s stock, which is almost 10% lower than the current market price.","Hard drive manufacturer Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is scheduled to announce its Q2 FY 2015 earnings on January 26. Seagate’s net revenues grew by nearly 8% year-on-year (y-o-y) to $3.8 billion in the quarter ending September, primarily due to a 7% y-o-y rise in overall shipments to almost 60 million units. Unit shipments for both enterprise and compute storage (which includes hard drive for laptops and computers) witnessed an 8-9% annual growth during the quarter. The company expects the strong demand for enterprise storage and notebook hard drive units to continue through the fourth calendar year quarter as well. [1] Seagate shipped nearly 60 exabytes (1 exabyte = 1 billion gigabytes) of data via hard disk drives in the Q1’15, which was an increase both sequentially (+21%) and annually (+22%). Additionally, the average capacity per drive shipped by Seagate in the quarter crossed the 1 terabyte (1000 gigabytes) mark for the first time ever. However, the average selling price (NYSE:ASP) per drive sold by the company declined by 3% y-o-y to $60 for the quarter owing to a higher mix of compute storage drives relative to high-end enterprise storage drives.We have a $58 price estimate for Seagate’s stock, which is almost 10% lower than the current market price. Seagate’s stock price has risen by nearly 10% since the company announced its Q1 FY 2015 results in late October.Trends Across Product Categories The company shipped about 8.8 million enterprise storage units in the quarter ending September – about 19% higher than the preceding quarter. [2] A similar sequential rise in enterprise unit shipments was observed in case of competing hard drive manufacturer Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). Western Digital’s enterprise storage unit shipments rose by almost over 10% from the previous quarter to 7.7 million unit shipments during the September quarter. [3] The company’s enterprise storage division could witness further growth if demand for enterprise-grade hybrid drives picks up. As of Q1’15, Seagate posted solid figures for hybrid drives only in the consumer market. We currently forecast Seagate to end the calendar 2014 at just over 32 million enterprise storage units sold, and further rise to over 40 million units in the next couple of years.In terms of compute units (desktops and notebooks combined), Seagate sold 18.7 million desktop storage units, which was marginally lower than the prior year quarter while notebook and netbooks storage unit shipments rose by 17% y-o-y to over 20 million units. In this domain, Seagate outperformed Western Digital, which had nearly flat sales over the prior year period. Back in June 2014, management mentioned that the world’s three largest PC manufacturers have started offering Seagate’s hard drives in their mainstream product lines, due to which it expects a significant improvement in demand. As a result, the company shipped 3 million hybrid drive units in the September quarter alone, and almost 12 million hybrid drive to date. Furthermore, Seagate expects a healthy demand for notebook and netbook shipments through the year-end and in the coming quarters. We currently forecast Seagate to ship over 71 million laptop hard drives through the end of calendar year 2014, up from 67 million units in 2013.Seagate’s consumer electronics units for gaming consoles, DVRs and other media devices declined by over 3% y-o-y to 6 million units in the most recent quarter. Similarly, the company’s consumer electronics unit shipments declined by over 8% y-o-y to 16.5 million units through the first three quarters of 2014. Comparatively, Western Digital’s consumer electronics storage unit shipments have grown by 40% year-over-year to 30 million units in the same period. The growth in Western Digital’s consumer electronics storage units was fueled by demand for storage drives for gaming consoles from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE), which use 500 GB 2.5” form-factor storage disks. [4] Seagate expects to maintain its share in gaming storage products with no significant rise in demand due to refreshed product lines from Microsoft or Sony. However, the company expects consumer electronics unit shipments to be seasonally higher in the latter half of the calendar year.Margins Could Pick Up Seagate expects consolidated revenues in Q2’15 to be 5% higher than the prior year quarter at $3.7 billion, with its $374 million Xyratex acquisition to contribute nearly $200 million to net revenues during the quarter. Moreover, the $450 million acquisition of the PCI Express (PCIe) business of Avago Technology is also likely to start contributing meaningfully to the company’s top line. Furthermore, low enterprise unit shipments in the first half of the calendar year kept average selling price (ASP) per drive low at about $60-61 per unit, compared to $62-63 in preceding quarters and the year ago period. ASPs could pick up in the coming quarters if demand for enterprise-grade storage picks up.Disclosure: None"
2828216,24663,2015-01-18T16:29:35-05:00,"A recovery in PC shipments is now evident.Rather than picking which PC-related stock will benefit, it's better to own a large piece of a PC-related industry.STX and WDC are great choices with their HDD market share and investments outside of PCs.","Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) fourth quarter report tells investors a lot of things, with one being that PC shipments continue to recover. In the second and third quarters, investors saw flashes of a potential PC recovery, but with Intel noting a 6% increase in volume in its PC CPU division during its last quarter, it is becoming even more apparent that moderate growth is here to stay. Not to mention, Gartner's recent estimate that global PC shipments increased 1% further adds to the notion of a recovery. Due to this performance, companies Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) might very well have a lot to gain.Why Seagate and Western Digital? The simple answer is because both have complete exposure to the PC market along with a growing presence in other markets that have performed quite well in recent years. One thing investors must consider is that strong performance in the PC space is not yet widespread. The strength of the industry can be traced back to commercial PCs, notebooks and Chromebooks, with consumer PCs finally starting to show some balance after steep multi-year declines in shipments. As a result, volatility and unpredictable sales are often associated with today's PC-related marketplace.This fact makes investments in the space risky. For example, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) controls nearly 20% of the PC space, but is its 20% outperforming or underperforming the broader industry? This is the question that must be answered when looking at big PC-related companies. Another example is the strength of Intel's business and the poor performance of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Examples like this can be found throughout the industry, where one competitor performs well and the other lags, and then it reverses.That said, hard disk drives (HDDs) are a high-margin business and a necessary storage requirement for PCs, and Western Digital and Seagate Technology own about 85% of the market combined. That gives investors near total exposure to the PC space by holding two different stocks, which might be the best way to play the recovery in PCs.A perfect illustration of why it is wise to own both Western Digital and Seagate in a portfolio can be seen in their market share performance over the last year. From January 2013 through July 2014 Seagate's share of the HDD market fell from 43% to 39%. In the same period, Western Digital's rose from 43.6% to 45.7%.This increase in share for Western Digital is a likely result of its leading presence with enterprise drives. During its last quarter Western Digital shipped over seven million enterprise drives, an increase of nearly threefold from the same period three years ago. Meanwhile, Seagate has made larger investments in non-PC applications over the last couple years, affecting its HDD market share, but also growing its emerging businesses with SSDs and other storage products.Albeit, Seagate Technology continues to hold a strong grasp on the consumer side of HDDs, and also in data centers. During its most recent quarter, Seagate's market share rose to 40% while Western Digital's declined to 44%. While some attribute Seagate's strong performance to its launch of the first ever 8TB drive and other high-performance HDDs, the point is that future market share performance of one company or the other is hard to predict, if not impossible.Regardless, for investors who own one stock or the other, the volatility that comes with quarter-to-quarter market share between Seagate and Western Digital must be considered as an influence to the respective stock price. Instead of trying to predict which company might gain more market share from quarter-to-quarter, the best idea is likely to invest in both, and gain exposure to the overwhelming majority of the HDD market as PC sales continue to stabilize and grow.All things considered, there is one final reason that both Western Digital and Seagate Technology are good investments as plays on the PC. That is their innate ability to evolve and reward shareholders for their patience. Six years ago, the overwhelming majority of Western Digital and Seagate's revenue came from PC applications, or HDDs sold for PC use; well over 85%. But, with desktop shipments falling by roughly 25% over the last three years, both companies have had to become more creative to counter those losses.Today, nearly half of Seagate's shipments come from non-PC applications, and almost 40% for Western Digital. This shows that Seagate and Western Digital are no longer dependent on a strong PC market to survive. However, with a combined 85% share of the HDD market, both companies would certainly thrive in a market with strong PC shipments. As a result, investors should really like both companies, not just one, but both as a way to gain exposure to nearly all of the HDD market. At 11 and 12 times forward earnings, respectively, Seagate and Western Digital present a value investment opportunity not often seen in today's market. Two stocks ready to surge in a strong PC environment, but that can still thrive without continued PC gains due to smart investments and diversification. Hence, Seagate plus Western Digital is a wise, safe and potentially lucrative investment combination long-term."
2806745,22148,2015-01-09T11:29:55-05:00,Seagate announces interesting products at CES including the wireless product that offers a 500GB portable wireless hard drive that is compatible with popular smartphones and tablets.Bullish yields including a large-scale stock repurchase plan have supported the surging stock price over the last several years.Seagate is a solid buy based on value and continuously high yields.,"Possibly the best stock repurchase plan of any large-cap stock over the last decade was the one undertaken by Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) over the last four years. The storage company ramped up buybacks starting in 2011 and surprisingly has maintained highly impacting levels despite a surging stock price.Back at the start of 2011, the stock of Seagate Tech had languished for years when the company came out with a big buyback plan. In hindsight, it was a signal of the increased confidence from less competition and improving margins in the storage space. The consolidation in the sector led to a huge increase in profits for a struggling industry and even larger buybacks in the following years.With the stock up over 300% in the last few years, is the run finally over?CES Isn't That KeyAt the Consumer Electronics Show, Seagate released a few interesting devices including a 500GB Wi-Fi capable hard drive called the Wireless. Along with the Seven, Seagate has several interesting storage devices that are either slim or capable of storing content from mobile devices including compatibility with smartphone and tablets like the iPhone and iPad. In addition, it launched Personal Cloud devices providing consumers with multi-TBs of capacity for home storage.The news though for non-techie investors is whether the company combines these announcements with more stock buybacks. The ultimate sign that Seagate has winning products in the market is the willingness of management to buy more stock at these higher levels instead of spending available capital to buy technology from another company.Bullish YieldsThe impressive part of the Seagate capital distribution plan is that high level returns to shareholders have been maintained even with the stock surging from $15 to over $60 since the start of 2012.STX data by YChartsThe key to the high yields is the continuously large and increasing stock buyback. The diluted shares outstanding are down dramatically from nearly 525 million nearly five years ago to only 337 million shares now. Combined with the constantly high dividend yield that now sits at 3.4%, Seagate is able to produce the 11.5% net payout yield shown above even with the surging stock price.STX Stock Buybacks (Quarterly) data by YChartsTakeawayWhile the products announced at CES sound interesting, the real news remains the positive signals of the ongoing large-scale stock buybacks. Even after the incredible rise in the stock price, Seagate still trades at only 11x 2015 earnings. Not only does the stock remain cheaply valued, but the large buybacks continue to add more value due to the low stock valuation. Seagate remains a solid buy."

However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that investors must take emotion out of the equation, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham, and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Defensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - December 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryConclusionSeagate Technology does fairly well in the ModernGraham model, and is suitable for Enterprising Investors. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the inconsistent dividend history, lack of earnings stability over the last ten years, and the high PB ratio, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. As a result, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $0.34 in 2011 to an estimated $4.68 for 2015. This is a strong level of demonstrated growth, which is well above the market's implied estimate of only 2.27% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure, assuming that some slowdown will occur, but still estimates a growth figure much higher than the market's implied rate. Therefore, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value well above the current price, indicating the company is significantly undervalued at the present time."
2734695,23479,2014-12-05T13:35:27-05:00,,"Hard drive manufacturers Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) face an uphill battle in attempting to sustain sales of traditional rotating-disk drives in the coming years. Since the introduction of flash-based memory chips, there have been constant talks about how long it will be before hard disk drives eventually become obsolete. NAND-flash based storage, or solid state drives (SSD), have numerous advantages over rotating-disk drives, ranging from the sheer speed of read/write operations, low latency in data access, relatively low power consumption, as well as lighter and more durable drives with a greater resistance to mechanical shock. So why hasn't there been an industry-wide switch to solid state drives already?It all comes down to the price. Traditional storage drives currently cost around 7 to 8 cents per usable gigabyte, whereas even the best-priced SSDs cost over $0.40 per usable gigabyte. However, it is interesting to note that SSD prices have been falling drastically in the last few years as demand has picked up. Prices are likely to continue to drop in the coming years, thereby posing a major threat to hard drive makers such as Seagate and Western Digital. In this article we take a look at the presence of NAND-flash chip makers in the SSD market and how the drop in SSD prices could impact them. How Costly Are SSDs Really?In dollar terms, solid state drives are over 5 times more expensive than hard disk drives (HDD) on average, as mentioned earlier. However, there are two points of note here. First, SSD prices are falling at a significantly higher rate than HDDs. [1] Although this does not imply that SSDs could become cheaper than HDDs anytime soon, it should certainly make purchasing a solid state drive more justifiable. Secondly and more importantly, SSDs aren't all that expensive if the price per gigabyte per second is measured - a metric which could be a more comprehensive point of comparison of cost vs. performance. For calculating this metric, the cost to bandwidth ratio, or the sequential read speed (in gigabytes/second), is used against the price of the drive to arrive at price per GB per second.According to data compiled by Enterprise Storage Forum using mid-2014 prices, the price for SSDs varied from $1,000 to $5,000 per GB per second depending the make and configuration of the drives. This figure was obtained for a number of SSDs from prominent manufacturers such as Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Toshiba, SanDisk (SNDK), Seagate, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Kingston. Comparatively, the price per GB per second for Seagate's enterprise grade hard drives stood at around $1,200 per GB per second. [2] By that metric, SSDs are not as comparatively expensive as they appear on a simple price per GB comparison.How Seagate And Competitors Line Up On SSD SalesSamsung leads the pack of SSD manufacturers with a commanding 28.5% share in the SSD market in 2013, according to a Gartner report. [3] Its share went up from 23.2% in 2012 to generating $3.1 billion in the $11 billion total market in 2013. Samsung has maintained a 28% share in in the first half of 2014 as well, making it the clear leader in the segment. Next in line was Intel with a 13.7% share in 2013. The chip maker has lost share in 2014 thus far, losing out to SanDisk and Toshiba during the year. Intel recently announced an agreement with Micron to produce 3D-NAND chips starting in 2015, which should help it compete better with SanDisk and Toshiba. [4] SanDisk had an 11.7% market share in 2013, up from just 5% in the previous year. SanDisk's volume share has also risen to over 23% of the unit sales in 2014 due to a combination of factors ranging from the Fusion-io acquisition, its agreement with Toshiba to co-manufacture 3D-NAND and OEM agreements with large customers such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to produce flash memory for their products. [5] Other manufacturers such as Toshiba and Micron had mid-single digit market shares in the segment in 2013.Although Seagate offers solid state drives for both enterprise use as well as embedded in personal computers and laptops, and a range of branded solid state drives which it sells via its retail channel, its share in the SSD market is significantly lower than competitors. Both Seagate and Western Digital have often downplayed the importance of pure SSDs in the past and focused on either hybrid drives that use flash-based storage as cache memory riding on top of a HDD or alternates to SSDs such as ethernet-connected drives or helium-filled storage drives. It wasn't until mid-2013 that Seagate announced its 600 series pure solid state drive in the consumer market. [6] Because they entered the arena much later, Western Digital and Seagate are dwarfed by Samsung, Intel and SanDisk (after acquiring Fusion-io) in worldwide SSD sales, as the chart below illustrates (Gartner data). [7]Gartner Data via The RegisterAn interesting point to note here is that all top SSD sellers own (or co-own in the case of SanDisk and Toshiba) NAND flash manufacturing capacities. As a result, when Seagate acquired Samsung's hard drive business back in 2011, there was an agreement between the two that allowed Seagate to source NAND chips from Samsung. Seagate currently has a sourcing agreement with both Samsung and Toshiba for NAND-flash chips. Furthermore, Seagate's $450 million acquisition of LSI's SandForce PCI Express (PCIe) business was an indicator that Seagate was finally getting serious about the pure SSD business.What To Expect From SeagateIn the coming quarter, Seagate expects consolidated revenues to be 5% higher than the prior year quarter at $3.7 billion, with its $374 million Xyratex acquisition expected to contribute nearly $200 million to net revenues during the quarter. Moreover, the LSI-flash acquisition also should start contributing meaningfully to the company's top line. However, it is evident that the SSD market is not even close to the near duopoly enjoyed by Seagate and Western Digital in the hard drive business. With LSI's SandForce business under its belt, Seagate now has the SSD controller technology it previously lacked. Seagate has an early advantage in PCIe storage, which is currently a niche domain. The chart below shows Seagate's presence in the enterprise SSD market. [7]Gartner Data via The RegisterSeagate still has a long way to go in the non-enterprise SSD market segment, particularly for PC and laptops. Additionally, the company continues to push for hybrid drives for PC and notebooks rather than pure SSDs. As a result we forecast Seagate's PC storage drive price per unit to decline at a CAGR of 3% through the end of our forecast period. We also forecast Seagate's laptop storage drive per unit to decline at a similar rate through our forecast period. The growing adoption of SSDs could drive ASP per drive higher and boost revenues. If Seagate's price per hard drive for both laptops and PCs stay at or near current levels through the end of the decade, it could imply a 5% upside to our $58 price estimate for Seagate, which is about 10% lower than the current market price. You can modify the interactive charts below to gauge the impact changes in the price per storage unit for Seagate's PC and laptop divisions will have on our price estimate for the company.Disclosure: No positions."

Revenue growth in the last 10 years has been 6% but it has been only 3.8% since 2010 due to the decrease in PC sales (Seagate's main customers are Dell and Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ)). In a recent conference call and presentations to investors, management stated that revenue is expected to grow 3-5% in 2015 and, from 2017, 6-8% c.a. In the base case scenario of the model, I assumed for years 2015 and 2016 a growth rate of 7%, which decreases 10% each year for the following 10 years to 2.3%, the current yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury Bonds, which is a good proxy for long-term growth rate in developed countries. I raised expected growth in the short term compared to management statements mainly because of the recent strong quarter (revenue increased 8% on a YoY basis). Utilizing these assumptions, the compounded average growth rate in next 5 years would be 6.2%, slightly higher than the 10-year average, 4.4% in the entire period. The numbers also are consistent with expected growth in the data industry. Research cited by both Seagate and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) reports that data will grow 40% from 2013 to 2020, a figure in-line with the hypothesized growth in revenue (assuming constant data/data stored ratio).Management also expects an operating margin in the range 13-15%, a reasonable assumption given that the average operating margin in last 5 years has been 15%. I used the same range in the model, taking the mid-point as a base case scenario.I adjusted the income statement capitalizing R&D expense, since this item provides benefit also in subsequent periods but it's expensed due to accounting rules. I hypothesized a useful life of 5 years, slightly higher than the average useful life of other intangible assets on the balance sheet. This operation has an effect on net income:Source: Company Annual Report, Author's CalculationThe adjustment also impacts the balance sheet since it creates a research asset that increases both long-term assets and equity.Source: Company Annual Report, Author's CalculationThe company capital expenditures have been below the long-term target of 6-8% of sales in the last 5 years. Including investments, it ranged from 5.5% to 8% of sales since 2008, a decrease from more than 9% in the three previous years. Net capex (capital expenditure less depreciation) has been flat in the last 5 years, although non-cash working capital increased from 2% to 5% of revenue. If R&D expense is considered, the company increased capital invested by $500 million, less than 1% of total revenue. For comparison, on average the companies in the computer/peripherals sector invest 3% of sales.Instead of modeling capex and working capital, I accounted for reinvestment needs using a sale to capital ratio of 3, the average of the sector. That means for every $3 increase in sale, $1 is reinvested into capital.Source: Company Annual Report, Author's CalculationThe table reports the sale to capital ratio for the last 5 years. The values are higher than those used in the model, which is consistent with management intention to increase the level of investments.Since management decided to return capital to shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks, acquisitions have been financed with debt. In last 5 years, long-term debt increased 80% to $3.9 million and the debt/equity ratio (adjusted for capitalized R&D expense) rose to 0.64 from 0.45 in 2010. In order to reduce the total amount outstanding and interest paid, Seagate is repurchasing its debt on an open market. I assumed that the company will buy back $1 billion of debt in 2015 and 2016 and thereafter it will finance 30% of new investments (both in capital and working capital) with debt, keeping a constant debt/equity ratio of 0.4.To estimate the cost of equity, I utilized data from Prof. Damodaran's website and Moody's rating. I calculated an equity risk premium for Seagate of 6%, starting from an implied equity risk premium of the US market of 5.2% and calculating the total risk premium considering the company's exposure to different geographic areas.Source: Company Annual Report and Prof. Damodaran website, Author's CalculationTax rate is another input needed to estimate the cost of equity. Seagate's effective tax rate during the last 10 years has been roughly zero due to the utilization of loss carry forward. Furthermore, operations in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand operate under various tax holidays and tax incentive programs, which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020. I therefore estimated a tax rat, without inclusion of loss carry forward, of 5.5% for years 2015-2020, and I utilized the Irish statutory tax rate (25%) in following years. The actual normalized tax rate would probably be lower, as reported in the annual financial report, but I calculated that it will probably be in the range 23-24%, adding less than $500 million to equity value in a base case scenario.To estimate the company's fundamental beta, I started from the global average industry unlevered beta of 1.11 and adjusted it for leverage. It starts from 1.64 in 2015 and decreases to 1.53 the following year due to reduction in the debt/equity ratio. Since beta should decrease with time toward 1, I adjusted the value such that it decreases constantly in years 2016-2026 to the industry average. With these assumptions, cost of equity goes from 12% in 2015 to 9% in the terminal year.Equity fair value resulting from the base case scenario is $20.8 billion. This number should be sum $1.1 billion of excess cash (after deducting $1.5 billion, the level of cash that management declared will be kept for working capital requirements, from cash on balance sheet as of June 2014) and tax assets, that I valued at book value ($600 million). The total is $22.9 million, slightly higher than the current market cap.To account for variability in revenue growth and EBIT margin, I run 1,000 Montecarlo simulations with independent random inputs. I used the growth path hypothesized above allowing for a variability of +/- 1% and EBIT margin ranging from 13% to 15%. This is the resulting distribution of equity value:Source: Author's Calculation90% of values are included between $21.5 billion and $24.6 billion so that, given the assumptions made, the stock is marginally undervalued at the current market price.In the model, the return on equity goes from 27% in 2015 to 22.3% in the terminal year, 13% higher than the cost of capital. The decrease is due to a higher tax rate, lower leverage and lower sales turnover.Is such extra return sustainable? Although there are reasons to believe that the industry (composed by two major players) and the continued spending in R&D allow for returns higher than cost of capital, I think that such difference would be difficult to sustain in the long period.In the table below is reported the DuPont decomposition (adjusted for capitalized R&D expense) in year 2014 for Seagate and its main competitor Western Digital:Source: Seagate and Western Digital Annual Report, Author's CalculationWestern Digital has lower ROE, despite higher profit margin, due to lower turnover and leverage. The company increased invested capital in 2012 with the acquisition of Viviti Technologies Ltd. The investment helped Western Digital expand its revenue to the $15 billion level and become the major player in the market. In the last 5 years, Western Digital revenue grew 9% c.a. while Seagate only 3.8%. The sales to invested capital (adjusted) ratio was 1.4 in 2014 for Western Digital, while for Seagate it is projected to be 1.7 in the steady state. Western Digital also spent more in R&D, on average 9% a year for the last 5 years, while Seagate only 8%.I think that to achieve the growth level hypothesized, Seagate should increase the capital invested more than stated, driving asset turnover and ROE down. Additionally, to regain the market share lost, Seagate could start a competition on price that will lower margins for both companies.That would put some downside pressure on implied fair value since cash distributed to shareholders would be reduced. Given that the appreciation suggested by the model is marginal, I don't consider Seagate a good opportunity at this price."

        Explanation and back-testing of the ""ValueSheet"" ranking system.
        Description and a buy recommendation for the third-ranked stock of the system: Seagate Technology.","Most S&P 500 stocks pay dividends. In fact, 424 of them pay some dividends. 365 companies have a yield greater of 1%, 212 companies have a yield greater of 2%, 95 companies have a yield greater of 3%, and 35 companies have a yield greater of 4%. Moreover, 79 S&P 500 companies have raised recently their payment (last dividend declared is greater than last dividend paid).The table below shows the top twenty S&P 500 dividend yielders.Source: Portfolio123A Ranking system sorts stocks from best to worst based on a set of weighted factors. Portfolio123 has a powerful ranking system which allows the user to create complex formulas according to many different criteria. They also have highly useful several groups of pre-built ranking systems, I used one of them the ""ValueSheet"" in this article.The ""ValueSheet"" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like; valuation ratios, growth rates, profitability ratios, financial strength, asset utilization, technical rank, industry rank, and industry leadership, as shown in Portfolio123's chart below.In order to find out how such a ranking formula would have performed during the last 15 years, I ran a back-test, which is available by the Portfolio123's screener. For the back-test, I took all the 7,014 stocks in the Portfolio123's database.The back-test results are shown in the chart below. For the back-test, I divided the 7,014 companies into twenty groups according to their ranking. The chart clearly shows that the average annual return has a very significant positive correlation to the ""ValueSheet"" rank. The highest ranked group with the ranking score of 95-100, which is shown by the light blue column in the chart, has given by far the best return, an average annual return of about 17%, while the average annual return of the S&P 500 index during the same period was about 3% (the red column at the left part of the chart). Also, the second and the third group (scored: 90-95 and 85-90) have given superior returns. This brings me to the conclusion that the ranking system is very useful.After running the ""ValueSheet"" ranking system on all S&P 500 stocks that pay a dividend with a higher than 2% yield, on November 04, I discovered the twenty best stocks, which are shown in the table below.

The company offers hard disk drives, solid state hybrid drives, and solid state drives, which are designed for enterprise servers, mainframes, and workstations; for desktop and notebook computers; and for various end user devices, such as digital video recorders, gaming consoles, personal data backup systems, portable external storage systems, and digital media systems. The company was founded in 1979 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.Valuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of STX, the data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.STX's valuation metrics are very good; the forward P/E is very low at 11.10, and the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is also very low at 8.32. The average annual earnings growth estimates for the next 5 years is high at 12.05%, and the PEG ratio is low at 1.00. The PEG Ratio - price/earnings to growth ratio is a widely used indicator of a stock's potential value. It is favored by many investors over the P/E ratio because it also accounts for growth. A lower PEG means that the stock is more undervalued.Latest Quarter ResultsOn October 27, Seagate reported its first-quarter fiscal 2015 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.09 (7.2%) and beat Street's consensus on revenues.Financial Highlights for Fiscal Q1'15Source: First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference CallIn the report, Steve Luczo, Seagate's chairman and chief executive officer, said:Dividend and Share RepurchaseSeagate has been paying dividends since 2003, but had stopped it payments in 2009 and 2010.The forward annual dividend yield is fairly high at 3.37% and the payout ratio is only 35.8%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was extremely high at 110%.On October 22, Seagate announced that its Board of Directors has approved a 26 percent increase in the Company's targeted regular cash dividend. The targeted annual dividend will increase from $1.72 to $2.16 per share and will continue to be paid quarterly. The first payment at the new quarterly rate of $0.54 per share is scheduled to be paid on November 25, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 11, 2014.STX Dividend data by YChartsSince the company generates lots of cash, and the payout ratio is low, there is a good chance that the company will continue to raise its dividend payment.During the first quarter, the company generated approximately $602 million in operating cash flow, paid cash dividends of $140 million and repurchased approximately 3 million ordinary shares for $183 million.CompetitorsA comparison of key fundamental data between Seagate and its main competitors is shown in the table below.Seagate has lower trailing and forward P/E, and much higher dividend yield than its competitors, however, it has higher debt-to-equity ratio.Seagate's Efficiency and Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median, as shown in the tables below.Source: Portfolio123Technical AnalysisThe charts below give some technical analysis information.Chart: finviz.comThe STX stock price is 14.37% above its 20-day simple moving average, 10.55% above its 50-day simple moving average and 16.29% above its 200-day simple moving average. That indicates a short-term mid-term, and a long-term uptrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is at 0.14 and ascending, which is a strong bullish signal (a rising MACD histogram and crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). The RSI oscillator is at 63.62 which does not indicate oversold or overbought conditions.Analyst OpinionAnalysts opinion is divided, among the twenty-seven analysts covering the stock, four rate it as a Strong Buy, nine rate it as a Buy, thirteen rate it as a Hold, and one analyst rates it as an Underperform.TipRanks is a website that ranks experts (analysts and bloggers) according to their performance. According to TipRanks, among the analysts covering STX stock there are nine analysts who have the four or five star rating, six of them recommend the stock, and three analysts have a Hold rating on the stock.Source: TipRanksMajor DevelopmentsOn November 03, Seagate said that it fundamentally shifts economics of cloud computing. According to the company, its new kinetic storage solution slashes costs by up to 50 percent by simplifying configurations for large cloud data centers. According to Seagate, the Kinetic Open Storage platform has garnered broad industry support from cloud and enterprise customers, as well as software and hardware systems partners, including AOL, Digital Sense, and Hewlett Packard, which have collaborated to support the open Kinetic API and helped to enable this new storage technology to come to market.I believe that Seagate will benefit from its effort to offer solutions that significantly slash costs for cloud computing and big data, as these are strategic fast-growth areas.On September 02, Seagate announced it has completed its previously announced acquisition of the assets of LSI's Accelerated Solutions Division and Flash Components Division from Avago Technologies (NASDAQ:AVGO). On that occasion Steve Luczo, Seagate Chairman and CEO said:I consider the acquisition of LSI's flash-based assets very positive to Seagate since it expands the company's capabilities to deliver solutions for the growing flash storage market. Trendfocus, the storage analyst firm predicted about 53% growth rate in 2013 for the client SSDs market and 14% in the enterprise market.Seagate has shown significant earnings per share surprise in its last three-quarters, as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo Finance - Analyst EstimatesIn my opinion, the fact that the company has succeeded to beat analyst in its last three-quarters by a considerable margin, demonstrates the strength of its business. Hence, there is a good chance that Seagate will continue to surprise by reporting better than estimate results also in the future.STX's stock started its rally in January 2012, and continued to perform very well since then. Since the start of the year, STX's stock has gained 15.3%, while the S&P 500 index has risen 9.2% and the Nasdaq Composite Index has increased 11.1%. Moreover, since the beginning of 2012, STX's stock has recorded an astounding gain of 291.3%, while the S&P 500 index has increased 60.4% and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 78.1%. Nevertheless, considering its compelling valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects, the stock, in my opinion, still has room to move up.ConclusionIn my opinion, Seagate will benefit from its investments in developing new promising product lines including cloud systems and solutions and flash technology for connected storage. Furthermore, the new acquisition of LSI's flash-based assets will expand Seagate's capabilities to deliver solutions for the growing flash storage market. Seagate has compelling valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects; its PEG ratio is low at 1.00, and its EV/EBITDA ratio is also low at 8.32. Seagate has shown significant earnings per share surprise in its last three-quarters, and there is a good chance that Seagate will continue to surprise also in the future. Seagate is generating strong free cash flows and returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and increasing dividend payments. All these factors lead me to the conclusion that STX stock is a smart investment right now."
2776145,63483,2014-12-23T11:02:52-05:00,"Seagate Technology had an impressive quarter.Revenue has grown at a strong clip in the October quarter in spite of the slight decline in the June quarter.Gross margins continue to remain strong, and although net profit margins have slipped, this is due to one-time expenses.Prospects for the data storage industry are bright, with huge opportunities for growth.Given Seagate’s strong presence within the industry, expect the company to be able to capitalize on said opportunities.","OverviewRecently, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) released its quarterly results. Compared to the June quarter, the company has delivered a strong performance, with gross margins remaining steady and net margin decreasing solely due to one-time expenses which will be explored further in the article. Considering the explosion of growth within the data storage industry, and Seagate's strong presence within the HDD market, the company should be able to take advantage of this growth.Operating ResultsSource: Company's SEC FilingsAs seen above, revenue increased by approximately half a billion to $3.7b, representing a 14% increase from the previous quarter. Gross margins increased from $925m to $1b quarter-to-quarter, representing a 13% increase. Net income increased from $320m to $381m, a 19% increase. In other words, demand for the company's products continue to grow, while costs related to selling products more or less remain the same, on a percentage of sales basis.Source: Company's SEC FilingsAs a percentage of revenue, gross margins remain steady at 28%, while net income margin has decreased from 13% to 10% from the previous year. However, this is nothing to worry about, as these decrease in net income margins can be largely attributed to one-off charges. Of the $55m in marketing and administrative expense, $24m was due to a non-recurring cost. The company's overall expenses also were higher than normal as a result of additional expenses due to a 14-week quarter instead of the usual 12 weeks. Additional one-time expenses were the following - within product development, there was a non-recurring expense of $14m. As for amortization of intangibles, $4m in expenses were one-off as due to their relation to the acquisition of LSI's Flash Business, and a $61m expense embedded in the other expense line item is related to losses from the early redemption and repurchase of debt, also another non-recurring charge. All in all, if we exclude these expenses, the net income margin would have remained steady at 13%.Strong revenue growth is a sure sign that demand for the company's products have not faltered, and that its customers have not switched to competing products. This is key as although there is a lot of potential for growth as detailed below, Seagate needs to be able to take advantage of this growth and when the company's revenue continues to grow, it is a sure sign that its products are in high demand. With gross margins remaining steady and considering that the company's net profit margin would have remained at 13% if not for one-time charges as detailed above, this further cements my belief that the company is able to operate within a very competitive industry. If the company's margins were contracting quarter after quarter, I would be leery of its ability to compete. Fortunately, this is not the case.Growth OpportunitiesA January 2014 ZDNet article details the reasons supporting the rapid growth of the data storage industry - the following are those I think are the key reasons - the growing global dependency on digital storage, importance of reliable access to data, the value of backups and recoveries, among other reasons. IDC and EMC forecasted the size of the digital universe to increase from 2837 exabytes (in December 2012) to 40000 exabytes by 2020.As a reference, one exabyte equals 1000 petabytes, or a million terabytes, or a billion gigabytes.Of course, with such a huge increase in the digital universe, there must be somewhere to store all these data. Accordingly, IDC estimates that annual worldwide shipments of storage systems will rise from 22000 petabytes in 2013 to just under 90000 petabytes in 2016, as seen in the graph below.Considering the fact that the data storage industry is forecasted to almost double every two years, and with Seagate as one of the frontrunners in the industry, I expect the company to do very well going forward. This is because the company offers a range of solutions to address the growing market. As an example, Seagate's enterprise value HDD family provides up to 3TB of SATA-based enterprise storage, which is essentially low-cost bulk storage designed for the cloud. Seagate's main competitors in the HDD market are Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). Within the HDD market, Seagate continues to command a large share of the market as noted in this Kitguru report. Though the company is faltering in the SSD market, where its market share is paltry compared to giants such as Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), solid state storage is very expensive compared to hard disk drives, hence I expect most data will be stored on cheaper hard disk drives. Considering Seagate's strong position within the HDD market (the company sold 60.4 million of 138 million units shipped globally, according to the Kitguru report), I have no doubt of the company's ability to maintain its share of the market going forward.As a response to the explosion in the data storage industry, I expect Seagate to increase capital investment going into the future - something that they are already planning to do.As a reference, capital expenditures currently amount to $172m, if we exclude the acquisition of LSI's Flash Business, or 4.5% of revenue. The company clearly sees the opportunity for growth and aims to capitalize on it. Furthermore, considering the strong cash flow generation of the company (cash from operations amount to $602m in the most recent quarter) its liquidity ($2b in cash and equivalents, including a $500m undrawn credit facility), I expect the company to have no problem funding its investment needs going into the future.ConclusionTherefore, I expect revenue for the next few quarters to grow at the high end of the 10-15% range thanks to strong demand for data storage and the company's continued sales programs in order to further stimulate customer demand. Gross margins should remain more or less the same while net income margins should increase from its current depressed level of 10% to 12-14%, as I do not foresee further non-recurring charges to impact the company's bottom line materially. My outlook on 2015 for Seagate is bullish."

However, the company expects demand to pick up in the latter half of the calendar year.Seagate completed the acquisition of Xyratex in March this year, with the latter likely to contribute about $100 million to Seagate’s top line in Q4 FY 2014.","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is scheduled to announce its Q4 FY 2014 earnings on July 17. Seagate’s net revenues declined by 3% year-on-year (y-o-y) to $3.4 billion in the last quarter, owing to stagnating sales in the consumer electronics storage, branded hard drives and computer divisions. The only area of growth was enterprise storage, with a mild 2.5% y-o-y increase in unit shipments to 7.7 million units for the quarter. Seagate’s revenue guidance for Q4 FY 2014 is nearly 4% lower than the prior year quarter at $3.3 billion, which includes nearly $100 million that the Xyratex acquisition is likely to contribute. Not counting the Xyratex contribution, the company’s Q4 revenues could be 6% lower than the year-ago quarter. However, the company expects demand to pick up in the latter half of the calendar year.Xyratex and LSI Flash Acquisitions Seagate announced that it will acquire LSI’s flash business from Avago Technologies (NASDAQ:AVGO) in May for $450 million. Avago Technologies is one of the leading manufacturers of networking semiconductors and chips, with a market cap of around $18 billion. Avago had acquired storage and networking chip-maker LSI Corporation in a $6.6 billion acquisition in December 2013, with the combined entity expected to generate close to $5 billion in revenues annually. Approximately one-third of its net revenues were expected to come from storage semiconductor sales. The flash business is crucial to Seagate because of an increasing mix of solid state drives (SSDs), which use flash components, compared to traditional hard disk drives.LSI is one of the market leaders with PCI Express SSD technology, which can enhance storage performance of regular storage drives due to the fast connectivity offered. PCIe storage is presently a niche domain, but is expected to mature soon. (Seagate Drops Bomb On Storage Industry, Buys LSI Flash Business From Avago, Forbes, May 2014) Going forward, LSI’s components business is expected to contribute an estimated $40 million-$50 million per quarter during fiscal 2015, which should help Seagate compete with other players in the SSD market.Seagate completed the acquisition of Xyratex in March this year, with the latter likely to contribute about $100 million to Seagate’s top line in Q4 FY 2014. Xyratex was the largest hard disk drive processing equipment supplier with a portfolio that includes disk processing, inspection and testing equipment. Prominent hard disk manufacturers like Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY) also use Xyratex equipment for testing and inspection purposes. Seagate expects Xyratex to contribute $500 million-$600 million in revenues during its fiscal 2015.Enterprise Storage Units Could Pick Up Seagate’s average selling price (ASP) per drive declined from $63 per unit in Q3 FY 2013 to $61 in the last quarter as a result of nearly flat enterprise unit sales. The company reported a slowdown in enterprise storage unit sales, with shipments growing by only 2.5% y-o-y to 7.7 million units. Comparatively, the company witnessed a 7% increase in enterprise unit shipments in 2013. Consequently, Seagate’s net revenues for the March quarter declined by over 3% to $3.4 billion, compared to the prior year period.With the contribution made by Xyratex likely to be accretive starting this quarter, the company remains optimistic that these shipment volumes will pick up in the coming quarters. Additionally, LSI’s flash components business acquisition could help Seagate in more than just product sales. Seagate could source flash components at cheaper prices, which could help reduce production costs and maintain competitive pricing. This could in turn result in higher unit shipments of enterprise storage products.Disclosure: No positions."
2650135,24663,2014-11-07T12:04:12-05:00,"WDC has performed better than STX over last 16 months.In the past, STX drives were considered inferior to WDC in performance.Last quarter, STX unveiled data that might make it a better investment of the two stocks.","Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX) are considered by many on Wall Street to be equals. Combined, they control roughly 85% of the hard disk drive (HDD) space. These are storage disks used in PCs, laptops, DVRs, and to back up the cloud. Over the last couple years, Western Digital has emerged as the superior HDD company, but in the third quarter, we learned something new that might very well change the balance of power.Each and every quarter, both Western Digital and Seagate announce two key pieces of data buried within their company slides. The first is the estimated size of the overall HDD market. For the most part, both Western Digital and Seagate's numbers are similar, give or take two million shipments. The second, and more importantly, is each company's respective share of the high-margin HDD market. Check out how these two companies have performed since January 2013:As you can see, Western Digital did well at stealing market share from Seagate over a 16-month span. While there are no specific reasons for Western Digital's recent success, my personal opinion is that Seagate's products became inferior.Earlier this year, a very public Backblaze study found that only 73.5% of Seagate drives were still alive and functional after 36 months. The same study found a 94.8% and 96.9% 36-month survival rate for Western Digital and Hitachi drives. As a result of Western Digital's success, its company's valuation has appreciated at a much faster pace than Seagate Technology, as seen below.STX Market Cap data by YChartsThat said, in the third quarter, investors witnessed something that hasn't been seen in quite some time. Seagate pegged its HDD market share at 40%, and its overall revenue rose 8.3% year-over-year to $3.78 billion. Meanwhile, Western Digital's market share took an enormous step back, with its market share falling to 44% in its last quarter.Albeit there is still a large gap between Western Digital and Seagate's market share, but it is at least encouraging that Seagate showed an ability to steal share from Western Digital. Granted, much of that share gain might have to do with Seagate being the first company to ship an 8 TB drive, which could theoretically store about 1,600 movies, and is likely popular with large data centers. However, the fact that Seagate could create such a drive ahead of Western Digital is in itself a reflection of innovation, yet something else to be encouraged about.With all things considered, it might now be a good time to invest in Seagate Technology. The stock trades at just 11 times forward earnings, slightly cheaper than Western Digital at 11.5, and considering that both companies have near equal distribution channels and manufacturing capabilities, it seems practical that Seagate has more share to gain than Western Digital, looking ahead. Therefore, with Seagate having more drive options and having made good investments in alternative storage devices, its third-quarter market share growth might just be a good indication to buy Seagate over Western Digital."
2605135,24757,2014-10-28T12:49:36-04:00,"Dividend raised to $0.54 per quarter from $0.42, or about 3.6%.Revenue rose, but net income fell y/y.Plan is to expand the model further with hybrid and flash technology.","Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) showed there is life and perhaps even growth in the data storage drive market when it reported September quarter (fiscal Q1 2015) results on October 27, 2014.Revenue was $3.79 billion, up 15% sequentially from $3.30 billion in and up 9% from $3.49 billion in the year-earlier quarter. It was also above Seagate's prior guidance of ""at least $3.55 billion.""However, net income did not fare quite as well. On a GAAP basis net income was $381 million, up 19% sequentially from $320 million, but down 11% from $427 million the year earlier. On a non-GAAP basis net income was $453 million, up 22% sequentially from $370 million, but down 4% from $473 million the year earlier. The main reason for the y/y decline in net income was that the unexpected demand for hard disk drives (HDDs) was mainly at the low end of the market, which has lower profit margins. An increase in spend to prepare new products increased operating expense, which in turn lowered margins.On a per share basis, GAAP diluted EPS was $1.13, up 19% sequentially from $0.95 but down 3% from $1.16 the year earlier. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.34, up 22% sequentially from $1.10, and up 4% from $1.29 year-earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was able to grow y/y, despite the decline in net income, because Seagate has been returning cash to shareholders through stock buybacks on a rather large scale.Some of the positive results likely result from an increased demand for PCs due to the refresh cycle. Drives for cloud computing also saw strong demand, but it should be noted this demand tends to fluctuate depending on the timing of the building of new datacenters. Demand for gaming was also strong, which should indicate that Xbox One and PlayStation builds were strong in the quarter.Since much of what Seagate recognized revenue on in the September quarter will be sold to end customers in the December quarter, there is always the question of sell-through. Seagate inventories were reported to be at reasonably lean levels.Guidance was for revenue in the December quarter of $3.7 billion, slightly down sequentially. Given that consumer demand tends to drop off sharply in January, and HDDs shipped late in the December quarter go to fulfill March quarter demand, that is strong guidance.A notable milestone reached was that the average drive shipped had over 1 terabyte (1,000 gigabytes) of capacity. Terabyte drives only became generally available in 2007. While there are many factors driving demand for higher storage capacity even on low-end PCs and tablets, video is likely the leading factor. Seagate shipped the world's first 8 terabyte hard drives earlier this year.Hybrid drives, which put Flash storage in the same device with an HDD, are beginning to see appreciable sales. About 3 million were shipped by Seagate in the quarter. OEMs are beginning to like them because they simplify providing both very fast and very cheap storage on the same computer.Seagate has some potential to grow its business in flash (solid state or SSD) and hybrid drives, as well as competing with rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) to keep adding more and more storage capacity to individual devices. In the short run these investments are impacting margins and EPS. Seagate hopes the investments will pay off over a longer time frame.While it is hard to classify Seagate as a growth stock anymore, it is certainly not in the decline many pundits predicted two to three years ago. Seagate raised the dividend to $0.54 per quarter or $2.16 per year, which at a $60.00 stock price works out to 3.6%. At midday on October 27, following the analyst call, STX was trading near $59.00 per share. The 52-week high of $63.27 had been reached on September 2nd.Seagate has $2.2 billion in cash and equivalents. Operating cash flow was $602 million, of which $183 million was used to repurchase shares and $140 million was paid out in dividends. The dividend return was thus less than half of what Seagate returned to shareholders in the quarter.With 30-year treasuries today returning 3.03% and 10 years returning just 2.26%, I see Seagate as a relatively conservative mid-to-long term investment. Of course a global drop in data storage demand might put the Seagate dividend at risk, but it would have to be a fairly major drop to infringe upon the dividend. The more likely course is that global data storage demand will continue its steep climb."
2268593,23479,2014-06-13T18:43:03-04:00,"At the end of May, Seagate announced the acquisition of the flash business from networking semiconductor and chip manufacturer Avago Technology for $450 million.The flash business is crucial to Seagate because of an increasing mix of solid state drives, which use flash components, compared to traditional hard disk drives.The acquisition continues the trend of consolidation across the storage industry, with major storage companies acquiring smaller specialist manufacturers.","In its recent third fiscal quarter earnings, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) reported a slowdown in enterprise storage unit sales, with shipments growing by only 2.5% year-on-year to 7.7 million units. Comparatively, the company witnessed a 7% increase in enterprise unit shipments in 2013. [1] At the end of last year, Seagate acquired enterprise data storage systems and testing equipment maker Xyratex for $374 million in an effort to enhance its enterprise storage offerings. With the contribution made by Xyratex likely to be accretive starting this quarter, the company remained optimistic that these shipment volumes would pick up in the coming quarters. [2]Then, at the end of May, Seagate announced the acquisition of the flash business from networking semiconductor and chip manufacturer Avago Technology (NASDAQ:AVGO) for $450 million. [3] The flash business is crucial to Seagate because of an increasing mix of solid state drives (SSDs), which use flash components, compared to traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). This acquisition continues the trend of consolidation across the storage industry, with major storage companies acquiring smaller specialist manufacturers. For example, over the last few years Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) has acquired a number of companies such as Virident, SSD maker sTec and enterprise SSD manufacturer Velobit. Avago Technology And LSI CorporationAvago Technology is one of the leading manufacturers of networking semiconductors and chips, with a market cap of around $18 billion. Avago announced its intention to acquire storage and networking chip-maker LSI Corporation in a $6.6 billion acquisition in December 2013, with the combined entity expected to generate close to $5 billion in revenues annually. Approximately one-third of its net revenues were expected to come from storage semiconductor sales. [4] A few weeks after Avago completed the LSI acquisition, Seagate announced that it will buy LSI's flash components division.Back in 2011, LSI sold off its Engenio external disk storage systems business to NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) for $480 million. (NetApp Swallows Engenio In Storage Buyout Bacchanalia, Forbes, May 2011) However LSI continued its investment in flash storage by acquiring SandForce, a manufacturer and designer of flash memory controllers for SSDs, in early 2012. It is this particular division within LSI which Seagate is set to buy, with the deal expected to close by the end of next quarter.How LSI's Flash Business Fits InStagnating unit shipments led to a decline in overall revenues for Seagate owing to a decline in the average selling price (ASP) per drive from $63 in Q3 FY 2013 to $61 for the same period in 2014. Consequently, Seagate's net revenues for the March quarter declined by more than 3%, to $3.4 billion, compared to the prior year period. The newly acquired Xyratex is likely to contribute about $100 million to Seagate's top line in the current quarter, which could help Seagate meet its revenue guidance of $3.3 billion for the coming quarter. However, it would still be a 4% year-on-year decline.LSI is one of the market leaders with PCI Express SSD technology, which can enhance storage performance of regular storage drives due to the fast connectivity offered. PCIe storage is presently a niche domain, but is expected to mature soon. [5] Going forward, LSI's components business is expected to contribute an estimated $40-50 million per quarter during fiscal 2015. [6]But more than the direct contribution made by just selling flash components, the acquisition adds value on two fronts. Firstly, the sourcing of flash components is likely to become cheaper for Seagate. This could help the company reduce production costs and maintain competitive pricing, which could result in higher unit shipments of enterprise storage products. Secondly, it will help the company to better integrate products with leading flash technology. We estimate that Seagate's enterprise storage unit shipments will increase from nearly 32 million in 2013 to about 56 million by the end of our forecast period. If the unit shipments increase more from our current forecast to about 61 million at the end of the decade, it could imply a 4% upside to our $50 price estimate for Seagate's stock. Our price estimate is slightly below the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."

Prices vary of course, but a check at TigerDirect.com shows a Seagate 1 TB SATA HDD for $54.99. The cheapest 1 TB SSD is from Samsung, for $549.99.Four years after some analysts predicted the end of the HDD, and of Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), it is still ten times as cheap to store data on a hard drive as on an SSD. While the SSD story was not the only factor, STX hit a post-recession low of $9.05 on October 4, 2011. As it became clear the SSD threat was a Chicken-Little story, the stock gradually recovered, hitting a recent 52-week high of $62.76. (52-week low is $37.17).[Additional disclaimer: I initially invested in STX on June 12, 2012 at $23.13 per share.]Seagate recently announced it would acquire from Avago (NASDAQ:AVGO) the LSI SSD related businesses, ""providing Seagate with established Enterprise PCIe flash and SSD controller capabilities to deliver solutions for the growing flash storage market.""The LSI business is expected to generate $150 million in revenue in fiscal 2015. That is not a lot of revenue for Seagate, but it does provide an edge in the ongoing struggle for data storage market share. HDD competitors Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Toshiba's OCZ also compete in the SSD market, which is dominated by Samsung. Other notable players are Crucial/Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), SanDisk (SNDK) and Kingston. Seagate had no pure SSD devices available at TigerDirect when I checked, but had one hybrid (SSD + HDD) drive available.Seagate did not separate out its SSD revenue for the March quarter. It is fair to assume that almost all of its $3.41 billion in revenue was from HDD, with a small portion from hybrid drives. Since hybrid drives can offer most of the speed of SSD with most of the low cost per bit stored of HDDs, I expect hybrids to become a much bigger story going forward.March quarter revenue was down 3% y/y, so STX is not currently a growth stock. Growth of storage in the cloud has been offset by a decline of storage attached to declining PC units. Seagate claimed 40% of the HDD market in the quarter, with most of the rest belonging to Western Digital and Toshiba. Share varies by quarter, but has tended to be fairly stable.I believe Seagate could grow again as storage demands intensify. Most tablet users have noted the lack of local storage capability. New ultra-thin, low-power hard drives can solve that problem at an attractive price. However, a more conservative approach would be to assume stagnation for now.I believe STX still presents an attractive price proposition to investors at the $53.55 closing price on June 3, 2014. The dividend of $0.43. Per quarter that works out to 3.2%. The trailing P/E is under 12, which means an earnings return on investment of over 8%. You can't get that in the bond market. If revenue and earnings start to trend upward due to increased SSD sales, the P/E should also trend upward, giving a boost to the stock price.The balance sheet is neutral to my view with cash of $2.3 billion offset by long-term debt of $3.5 billion at the end of the quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was $319 million, of which $140 million was paid out in dividends. An additional $184 million was used to repurchase shares.I see STX as a relatively safe long-term investment, paying a nice dividend with some further upside potential if it can get traction in the SSD and hybrid drive markets. However, holders of the stock should keep up on data storage technology trends that could change the future prospects of STX and other HDD and SSD players.Disclosure: I am long STX.

The increase in the number of mobile devices, along with enterprise applications and the proliferation of cloud computing should continue driving demand for data storage in the future. According to Statista, the storage market, which was worth $23.5 billion globally in 2012, will grow to a size of $30 billion by the end of next year.This presents an tremendous opportunity for storage company Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) to improve its performance going forward. The company has been executing upon its key priorities and is optimizing its capital structure to accelerate long-term growth. As such, Seagate has raised $1.8 billion for investments through debt-financing, and will focus on the roll out of new products to bolster its position in the industry.Moves to tap the opportunitySeagate is focusing on accelerated investments and key acquisitions to build on its storage offerings to penetrate new markets and develop its technical capabilities. The company is tapping the cloud market with its varied solutions such as the ClusterStor, OneStor systems, and Evolve product lines. For example, ClusterStor is a cutting-edge product that will allow Seagate to deliver secure storage solutions. As per a report:At the same time, Seagate has acquired SSD controller and PCIe technologies from Avago for accelerating the completion of its integrated flash technology portfolio. The company believes that this move will increase its customer base and lead to fresh revenue opportunities.According to a Seagate press release:Thus, with such a move, Seagate is improving its product portfolio, which will allow it to tap the opportunity in the industry more effectively.Investing in the product portfolioAlso, Seagate is keen on investing in its product portfolio for storage technology in order to deliver superior quality storage products and solutions, and its investments seem to be producing results. Management claims that the company has received positive feedback for its 8 terabyte customer development units from key customers and cloud service providers. Seagate is developing key features for object-based storage, and this should help it improve its Kinetic platform into a differentiated offering in the cloud storage marketplace.Moreover, Seagate is constantly focusing on optimizing its client product portfolio and strengthening its competitive position, coupled with improving the client market dynamics. It has completed the qualification of its 7200 RPM notebook product at all key OEMs, and the company expects to accelerate its volume ramp going forward.The company is witnessing the expanding adoption of its products at major OEMs for its hybrid drives, and the top three PC manufacturers around the world at present offer its hard drive in their conventional product lines. The hard drive major has witnessed a solid increase in demand, and expects to ship more than 3 million hybrid drives during the September quarter.Additionally, Seagate sees healthy demand momentum building toward the back end of the year. It is expected that demand for hard drives will be in the 142 million units to 146 million units range for the September quarter, driven by factors such as rising sequential momentum in the cloud market, continued expansion of the notebook market, and increased demand for gaming products.Enticing valuationThus, the prospects of the storage industry are strong, and Seagate should benefit as a result of its key acquisition and product focus. But, what's even more impressive is its valuation. The stock has a cheap trailing P/E ratio of just 13, and its forward P/E ratio is lower at 10. This signifies earnings growth, which is further underscored by the fact that Seagate has a PEG ratio of just 0.96. The stock also has a robust dividend yield of 2.90%, along with a reasonable payout ratio of 37%.As such, Seagate looks like an enticing pick for the long run as the company's bright prospects are backed by impressive fundamentals."

Although Seagate significantly outperformed the market in 2013, its stock price has declined 16.5% from its January 21, 2014, peak value of $61.24. Seagate has compelling valuation metrics and solid earnings growth prospects. Furthermore, the company is returning value to its shareholders by stock buyback and by increasing dividend payments. In this article, I will explain why, in my opinion, Seagate stock is a smart investment right now.The CompanySeagate Technology designs, manufactures, and sells electronic data storage products. The company offers hard disk drives, solid state hybrid drives, and solid state drives, which are designed for enterprise servers, mainframes, and workstations; for desktop and notebook computers; and for various end user devices, such as digital video recorders, gaming consoles, personal data backup systems, portable external storage systems, and digital media systems. The company was founded in 1979 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.Valuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of STX, the data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.Seagate's valuation metrics are very good; the trailing P/E is very low at 11.40, and the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is extremely low at 6.57. According to James P. O'Shaughnessy, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is the best-performing single value factor. In his impressive book ""What Works on Wall Street,"" Mr. O'Shaughnessy demonstrates that 46 years back-testing, from 1963 to 2009, have shown that companies with the lowest EV/ EBITDA ratio had given the best return. Mr. O'Shaughnessy explains that EV/ EBITDA is a better way to assess value - that is, how cheap or expensive it is - than looking at the PE ratio alone. The EV/ EBITDA is neutral to a company's capital structure and capital expenditures. Stocks that have very high debt levels often have low PE ratios, but this does not necessarily mean that they are cheap in relation to other securities.Latest Quarter ResultsOn April 29, Seagate reported its third-quarter fiscal 2014 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.09 (7.20%) and was in-line on revenues. The Company reported revenue of approximately $3.4 billion, gross margin of 28.2%, net income of $395 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.17. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the net impact of certain items, Seagate reported gross margin of 28.5%, net income of $453 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.34.During the third quarter, the Company generated approximately $443 million in operating cash flow, paid cash dividends of $140 million and repurchased 3.5 million ordinary shares for $184 million. There were 326 million ordinary shares issued and outstanding as of the end of the quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments totaled approximately $2.3 billion at the end of the quarter.In the report, Steve Luczo, Seagate's chairman and chief executive officer said:DividendSeagate has been paying dividends since 2003, but had stopped its payments in 2009 and 2010.The forward annual dividend yield is high at 3.36% and the payout ratio is only 35%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past five years was high at 19.4%.Source: Charles SchwabCompetitorsA comparison of key fundamental data between Seagate and its main competitors is shown in the table below.Seagate has lower trailing and forward P/E, and much higher dividend yield than its competitors, but it has also a higher debt-to-equity ratio.Seagate's Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median, as shown in the tables below.Source: Portfolio123Technical AnalysisThe charts below give some technical analysis information.Chart: finviz.comThe STX stock price is 0.38% below its 20-day simple moving average, 3.52% below its 50-day simple moving average and 4.06% above its 200-day simple moving average. That indicates a short-term and a mid-term downtrend and a long-term uptrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is negative at 0.67 and ascending, which is a neutral signal (a rising MACD histogram and crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal).

Seagate is generating a lot of cash; its ttm price to free cash flow of 13.27 is among the lowest of all S&P 500 tech stocks. The company continued to deliver large sums of cash back to shareholders, during the third quarter the company generated approximately $443 million in operating cash flow, paid cash dividends of $140 million and repurchased 3.5 million ordinary shares for approximately $184 million. Furthermore, the new acquisition of Xyratex will expand Seagate's storage solutions portfolio even more.I consider Seagate's stock as a good combination of value and growth dividend stock, and in my opinion, after the retreat in its stock price, it is now an excellent opportunity for a long-term investment in a good company at a cheap price.Disclosure: I am long STX.

2192643,48501,2014-05-06T02:50:58-04:00,Demand for the company's products will in part be driven by cloud-service providers and big data analytics.The shares are currently fairly valued in the market.The technicals are bullish with the intermediate trend being bearish and the primary trend being bullish.,"Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), the hard disk drive manufacturer, reported less-than-stellar fiscal third-quarter results. Revenues were adversely impacted by unit shipments in the client compute segment and an overall lower average selling price. Also, the guidance that management provided suggests revenues are going to come in about $500 million below my forecast for the full year. On the bright side, the profitability margins are flat relative to the prior year, and the substantial share repurchase program is cushioning the results of operations on a per share basis.Looking forward, there is seasonal strength expected in the back half of the calendar year. Also, the acquisition of Xyratex is accretive to the results of operations; thus, Xyratex is expected to increase fiscal 2015 results relative to what they would have been. On the enterprise side, Seagate is planning to release an 8-terabyte drive that will likely be consumed by enterprises seeking solutions to the problems posed by big data, and the shift to the cloud. I expect the pace of unit shipments decline in client compute to improve in fiscal 2015. Consequently, overall the fundamentals are bullish.With that stated, at $50 per share, Seagate is fairly valued based on my estimated intrinsic value of $48 per share. Investors should accumulate shares below their intrinsic value.Recent DevelopmentsAnalyst's NoteSeagate Technology PLC is a leading provider of data storage products. Its principal products are hard disk drives, but the company also produces solid state hybrid drives, and solid state drives. Seagate's products are designed for multiple use cases, including (but not limited to) enterprise servers, mainframe and workstations, and client compute applications.Taking a high-level perspective, there is demand for traditional storage solutions that is coming from cloud-service providers. The client compute market remains slightly down to flat. There is demand for high-performance drives emanating from transactional operations. Video surveillance and higher definition media are increasing storage requirements. Lastly, there is increasing demand to store structured and unstructured data. Simply stated, consumer storage requirements are relatively soft, but enterprise storage requirements are a source of strength.The fiscal third quarter brought with it another set of disappointing results; previously, I was forecasting revenues of $14.2 billion, which is roughly flat with the prior year, but now I'm lowering my estimate to $13.8 billion. Revenues for the full year would be down about $500 million at $13.8 billion. The lower than forecasted revenues are attributable to weakness in client compute and softer ASPs. Client compute unit shipments declined just less than 8% y/y. Also, client non-compute has been a little weaker than I anticipated. The profitability margins were in line with my forecast. The table above includes the revised forecast.The liquidity and solvency positions are tracking in line with my forecast. Seagate is financed primarily with debt capital at this point, as the level of debt exceeds the level of equity. Management shows a tendency to grow the business through organic innovation. Also, over the last 10 quarters the debt as a percentage of assets increased from 30% to 40%. Granted the current costs of debt financing are extraordinarily low.There were revisions to the cash flows estimates, which emanate from the revenues revision. I'm now expecting $2.9 billion of cash flow from operations. Free cash flow to the firm is expected to coming in at $2.44 billion, and free cash flow to equity is forecasted to be just shy of $3 billion. The share repurchases were considerably larger than I expected for the fiscal year; I was expecting $1.5 billion of share repurchases and repurchases could total roughly $2 billion to $2.2 billion. Though the quantity of cash flows is moving in the wrong direction (shrinking), the absolute level of cash flows is appreciable.The client-compute market may remain relatively weak for an extended period. But Seagate is expected to continue to earn more than its cost of capital. Also, the firm controls almost half of the electronic data storage industry, which is expected to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Price erosion is a key risk to the outlook, but prices are expected by management to remain roughly flat.General RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in STX.Portfolio & ValuationThe technicals remain bullish. STX is in a bear market of intermediate degree and a bull market of primary degree. The two preferred scenarios are: this a dip-to-buy before a rally to a higher high, and this is the beginning of a trading range. Either way, for now, I'm bullish on STX, based on the technicals.The base case intrinsic value was lowered from $49.68 to $48.28 as the outlook for earnings deteriorated. At $50.50 per share, STX is slightly overvalued. Also, the forward valuations are roughly in line with the 5-years average valuations.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2178703,23479,2014-04-30T16:34:26-04:00,,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), a leading provider of electronic data storage products, announced mixed results in its its Q3 FY 2014 earnings call on April 29. The company shipped 7.7 million enterprise storage units during the quarter – a 2.5% increase over the previous year quarter, despite growing by over 7% in 2013. Desktop and notebook hard drive unit shipments for the quarter stabilized to just over 36 million units after facing a year of decline. On the other hand, unit shipments of Seagate’s non-compute products, which include consumer electronics and branded hard drives, declined by 2% to 11.3 million units, offsetting the growth provided by enterprise storage unit shipments.Stagnating shipments meant a decline in overall revenues owing to a decline in the average selling price (ASP) per drive from $63 in Q3 FY 2013 to $61 for the 2014 period. Consequently, Seagate’s net revenues for the March quarter declined by over 3%, to $3.4 billion, compared to the prior year period. The company has given revenue guidance of $3.3 billion for the coming quarter, which would be a 4% year-on-year decline. However, Seagate expects its latest acquisition, Xyratex, to contribute about $100 million to its top line during the coming quarter. Not taking Xyratex’s contribution into consideration, the company’s guided revenues are 6% lower than the previous year’s June quarter revenues. Seagate expects demand to pick up in the latter half of the calendar year.We have a $50 price estimate for Seagate’s stock, which is slightly below the current market price.Limited Growth In Enterprise Storage Seagate sold 7.7 million enterprise storage units during the quarter, a 2.5% increase compared to the prior year quarter. Comparatively, enterprise units shipments increased by over 7% in 2013. The company attributed the slowdown in growth to the increasing utilization rates of customers’ in-house inventory, which led to an increased product cycle time. Additionally, management mentioned that the slowdown in enterprise storage growth in the last six months was unlikely to last, and that they expect it to pick back up starting from the September quarter. Given the expected growth of end-user data, Seagate’s enterprise storage unit shipments could pick up growth to early 2013 rates in the latter half of the year.Seagate is likely to see continued strong demand for its new storage platforms such as Kinetic Open Storage and Xyratex Big Data storage products. The mix of products sold via the retail channel has been increasing in the last few quarters, and the company expects it to marginally increase further in the coming quarters. Looking ahead, the company expects solid growth in products sold via the retail channel such as network-attached storage (NAS) based products, especially for small and medium businesses, and its recently launched surveillance storage drives.Margins Improve, Outlook Remains ConservativeThe company’s non-GAAP gross margins improved by almost a percentage point over the same period last year to 28.5% for the quarter, attributable to a higher mix of solid state drives (SSD) and enterprise storage units. However, Seagate’s non-GAAP operating margins were lower than the prior year period at 14.7% due to a 13% increase in marketing and administrative expenses. Management mentioned that the company’s operating margins for the quarter were still slightly better than the company’s guidance due to lower-than-expected expenses in variable compensation. Looking ahead, the company expects it sales figures and margins to sequentially decline further in the June quarter, partially attributable to seasonal trends in consumer and branded hard drive sales. Additionally, the company expects stronger sales in customer and enterprise units in the second half of the calendar year rather than the June quarter, due to new product launches targeted for that period.Disclosure: No positions"

As sales of PCs slow down and competition from Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) rises, Seagate is having a tough time impressing investors. Its revenue is declining and earnings are also moving south now. Hence, should investors consider dumping Seagate and look at a better option such as Western Digital? Let's check.Weakness in the businessSeagate's growth in the cloud storage business is slowing down, and this was the reason behind the company's weak performance. Seagate is also seeing an increase in expenses in areas such as products for mobile devices and servers, plus declining sales of personal computers that use its products are another headwind.However, Seagate is strategically investing in its product portfolio and enhance its vertically-integrated manufacturing capabilities to effectively capitalize on the cloud, mobile, and open source storage trends that are being fueled by data growth. Strong cash flow, combined with the execution of capital allocation strategy, reflects that Seagate is on the right track of its goal of returning 70% of its operating cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year.But then, the fall in sales of personal computers has negatively affected the revenue of Seagate. Global PC shipments fell 10% last year. A shift in consumer focus from personal computers to smartphones and hand held devices has resulted in huge losses for Seagate. However, the company's management states that Seagate has benefited as people buy portable disk drives to back up data stored on tablets and smartphones. Hence, it is advisable for investors to think twice before investing in the stock.Looking ahead, Seagate is planning to buy fellow data-storage company Xyratex for about $374 million to expand its business in enterprise data storage systems. The acquisition is expected to add between $500 million and $600 million to Seagate's revenue in 2015. In addition, Seagate is tapping into the growing demand for products that help store data in the cloud and is reducing its dependence on personal computer hard drives as consumers shift to smartphones and tablets.Comparing with Western DigitalBut, investors should note that Seagate's rival Western Digital reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, driven by sales of higher-margin data storage products. Seagate posted a 3% year-over-year decline in drive unit shipments to 56.6 million, or 40% of the addressable market. In comparison, Western Digital's revenue was up in the previous quarter on a year-over-year basis while earnings jumped an impressive 28%. Moreover, if we compare the stats of both companies, Western Digital comes out on top.Source: Yahoo! FinanceReferring to the above table, we come to a conclusion that Western Digital is pretty impressive on the charts. The company is posting growth on both revenue and earnings, and this could benefit investors in the long run.ConclusionSeagate is under pressure due to weakness in its cloud business and the slowdown in the PC market. Also, from an investment perspective, we see that it is not a better buy than Western Digital. So, investors should consider selling Seagate and instead invest in Western Digital.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2096893,48501,2014-03-19T05:13:38-04:00,"Forecasting flat to down fiscal 2014 revenue.Seagate is fairly valued at $50 per share.The technicals suggest that this is a ""dip-to-buy.""","Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), the hard disk drive provider, reported first half of fiscal 2014 results that disappointed investors. Sales of the firm are slumping as consumers elect to purchase mobile devices that are manufactured with solid state drives rather than tradition hard disk drives. While the pace of the decline in PC sales has slowed recently, STX should continue to be adversely impacted by the shifting technology landscape for the rest of fiscal 2014.Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, revenue is forecasted to increase 3% as client compute sales stabilize and the firm builds more of presence in SSDs and SSHDs. Also, STX is forecasted to continue to generate sizeable cash flows, which is forecasted to result in significant share repurchases and an appreciable increase in the dividend.With that stated, based on the forecasted fundamentals, STX is fairly valued. Investors looking for exposure in electronic storage should prefer SanDisk (SNDK), based on its valuation.Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummarySeagate Technology PLC is a leading provider of data storage products. Its principal products are hard disk drives, but the company also produces solid state hybrid drives, and solid state drives. Seagate's products are designed for multiple use cases, including (but not limited to) enterprise servers, mainframe and workstations, and client compute applications.The hard disk drive industry is concentrated with two firms supplying almost all of the market. But the pricing power of the two firms is limited as, for the most part, buyers are concentrated and end users are constrained by income. The threat of new entrants into the hard disk drive industry is low, but firms with alternative technology, such as NAND, limit the profitability of hard disk drive manufacturers. Consequently, without capital distributions, STX's abnormal earnings would likely be minimal.Fiscal 2013 revenue was soft on lower ASPs and a weak client compute environment. The weakness in ASPs and client compute is expected to continue through fiscal 2014. But in fiscal 2015, I think we see a moderate rebound in client compute with continued strength in enterprise and non-client compute. The key risk to the forecast is the ASPs, but ASPs should be boosted by a product mix that includes larger volumes of hybrid and pure SSDs. For fiscal 2015, revenue is forecasted to increase 3% with gross margin expansion stemming from operating leverage. Consequently, fiscal 2015 EPS is forecasted to increase almost 61% as share repurchases decrease the outstanding share count.After declining, the financial leverage ratio started to trend higher as STX increased the level of debt relative to assets. It appears management is comfortable with the debt-to-capital ratio in the 0.45 to 0.60 range. In my opinion, that is an aggressive use of leverage. But the firm has ample liquidity.Cash flow from operating activities is expected to remain at roughly $3B with capital expenditures of roughly three quarters of a billion. Consequently, the forecast is for free cash flow to the firm of about $2.5B. Free cash flow to equity should continue to trend higher as the firm issues debt. Free cash flow to equity is forecasted to be spent on share repurchases and dividends.In conclusion, the forecast is for continued strong financial performance. But leverage poses a long-term risk, especially as consumer preferences shift to SDDs and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) increases its presence in the mission-critical enterprise segment. Also, price erosion pressures continue to pose a threat to cash flows. But industry consolidation and increasing quantities of storable electronic data provide a tailwind.RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in STX.Portfolio & ValuationSTX is in an intermediate term decline as part of a primary degree bull market. Simply stated, this is a ""dip-to-buy.""To value STX, a fundamentals based dividend discount model was used, which applied the 2014-EPS forecast to the justified PE. Consequently, the model found that STX is fairly valued. STX was charged a premium for its aggressive use of leverage, and the long-term growth rate is estimated as being 6%. At the base case intrinsic value, STX would be trading at 10 times estimated 2014 earnings and 1.2 times estimated 2014 sales.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

However, the company hasn't performed terribly since the depths of the Great Recession, but that's no reason to jump in head-first. Let's take a look at a calculation of the firm's intrinsic value and evaluate how Seagate stacks up in the context of the Valuentum style.But first, a little background to help with the understanding of some of the terminology in this piece. At our research firm, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. We think stocks that are cheap (undervalued) and just starting to go up (momentum) are some of the best ones to evaluate for addition to the portfolios. These stocks have both strong valuation and pricing support. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.Most stocks that are cheap and just starting to go up are also adored by value, growth, GARP, and momentum investors, all the same and across the board. Though we are purely fundamentally-based investors, we find that the stocks we like (underpriced stocks with strong momentum) are the ones that are soon to be liked by a large variety of money managers. We think this characteristic is partly responsible for the outperformance of our ideas -- as they are soon to experience heavy buying interest. Regardless of a money-manager's focus, the Valuentum process covers the bases.We liken stock-selection to a modern-day beauty contest. In order to pick the winner of a beauty contest, one must know the preferences of the judges of a beauty contest. The contestant that is liked by the most judges will win, and in a similar respect, the stock that is liked by the most money-managers will win. We may have our own views on which companies we like or which contestant we like, but it doesn't matter much if the money managers or judges disagree. That's why we focus on the DCF -- that's why we focus on relative value -- and that's why we use technical and momentum indicators. We think a comprehensive and systematic analysis applied across a coverage universe is the key to outperformance. We are tuned into what drives stocks higher and lower. Some investors know no other way to invest than the Valuentum process. They call this way of thinking ""common sense.""With that said, let's dig into Seagate's report.Seagate's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsIndustry StructureFirms in Seagate's industry primarily make storage solutions, but others may offer custom-designed computer/mobile interface solutions or other ancillary computer/mobile products. The industry is characterized by rapid technological change, which has not only increased the adoption of technologies for use in a variety of devices but also has put significant pricing/gross-margin pressure on industry constituents. Competition is fierce, threats of over-supply are continuous, and the prospects for generating long- term competitive advantages are negligible. We don't like the structure of the group at all. Even though recent performance at Seagate has been acceptable, the industry's fortunes can change on a dime.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Seagate's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 86.5%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.2%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Seagate's free cash flow margin has averaged about 20.3% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Seagate, cash flow from operations increased about 72% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 7% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Seagate's shares are worth between $51-$77 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. We use such a wide range mainly due to the industry's pricing dynamics which are unpredictable at times. Shares are trading just north of $51 each -- at the low end of the fair value range. We'd grow much more fond of Seagate if it were trading below the low end of our fair value range and also exhibiting positive technical and momentum indicators. Under this scenario, Seagate would register a much higher rating on the Valuentum Buying Index.The estimated fair value of $64 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 13.3 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8.4 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of -0.4% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 8%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 19.3%, which is above Seagate's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 0.5% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Seagate, we use a 10.2% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Our discounted cash-flow process allows us to arrive at an absolute view of the firm's intrinsic value. However, we also understand the critical importance of assessing firms on a relative value basis, versus both their industry and peers. Many institutional money-managers--those that drive stock prices--pay attention to a company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-earning-to-growth ratio in making buy/sell decisions. With this in mind, we have included a forward-looking relative value assessment in our process to further augment our rigorous discounted cash-flow process. If a company is undervalued on both a price-to-earnings ratio and a price-earnings-to-growth (NYSE:PEG) ratio versus industry peers, we would consider the firm to be attractive from a relative value standpoint. For relative valuation purposes, we compare Seagate to peers EMC Corp (EMC), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), and SanDisk (SNDK).Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $64 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Seagate. We think the firm is attractive below $51 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $77 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Seagate's fair value at this point in time to be about $64 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Seagate's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $80 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $64 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsIn the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index has stacked up per underlying score as it relates to firms in theBest Ideas portfolio.

Purpose-built for enterprise environments, the drive employs the T10- and T13-compliant power management criteria, empowering organizations to adapt systems for optimal energy consumption, resulting in up to 90% more power saved.Market Outlook and Prospects for the CompanyBig Data to Get BiggerWith data growing very rapidly, the IT industry is putting added effort into sorting out how the storage market will adapt to handle the increase. Data storage and cloud dealers need to cater to the storage issues related to rapidly growing data. According to EMC's recent report on storage trends, the top challenge encountered by IT managers is handling storage growth. As per the December 2012 report, IDC and EMC projected that from 2005 to 2020, the digital universe will expand by a factor of 300. This means that global data will be near 40 trillion GB by 2020 in aggregate.Although the quantity of data is growing rapidly, the cost per GB continues sloping downward. A report on average hard drive storage costs from statisticbrain.com states that a GB of data storage that cost $437,000 in 1980 has declined to $0.05 in 2013. Looking forward, the prices per GB are forecast to continue that downward trend as data creation escalates the need for bigger storage capacities. You can see from the following graph that Seagate's average capacity per drive among shipments made has risen from 653 GB in Q2 FY 2012 to 992 in Q2 FY 2014. This trend is in line with the industry as bigger storage capacities are in high demand. Therefore, the company's new 6TB drive capacity will definitely be in high demand.Source: STX Fiscal Q2 2014 PresentationIn a recently issued research report, Wikibon also declared its bullish standpoint on the big data services and analytics industry. The research firm projected that the big data industry is set to grow from $18.6 billion in 2013 to $50.1 billion in 2017, reflecting a remarkable 28.1% annual growth. According to IDC, unstructured data growth is doubling exponentially and will push the digital universe to reach 16 Zettabytes of data by as quickly as 2017. This will push cloud service providers to look for innovative ways to store more data while lowering operational costs.According to Dave Reinsel, IDC Group's vice president for storage and semiconductors, the cloud service providers across the world are building up terabytes of digital content every month, and the number is projected to continue its violent growth in the coming year. Storage of unstructured data has turned into a key high performance for analytics. Huge amounts of raw data need to be securely kept in non-volatile memory before it can be processed and eloquent conclusions can be reached from it. Moreover, the data needs to be backed up and should be available without delay by using high performance memory disks. This is where Seagate and its most recent drive come into play.The big data services and analytics industry is undergoing rapid growth due to the growing worldwide internet penetration, emergence of e-commerce industries in developing markets, and the move to high-resolution media standards. The partners of the company are also optimistic about the functionality and usage of the company's new drive.Seagate's Partners are OptimisticAccording to Meiji Chang, the general manager of QNAP, QNAP is eager to offer support for Seagate's new 6TB Enterprise Capacity 3.5 HDD v4 to its users. With 50% superior storage density and improved performance for near-line storage, QNAP regards Seagate's new 6TB HDD as the perfect tool to cater to the needs of QNAP's cloud data center customers who require optimized hardware for their exclusive workloads. It will also cater to the company's high capacity SAS-enabled Turbo NAS users who require high capacity and high reliability data storage.According to Alex Wang, CEO of Synology, Inc., Synology is also very delighted to work with Seagate to enhance its device offerings. According to Synology, the integration of Seagate's new 6TB Enterprise Capacity 3.5 HDD v4 into Synology's upcoming product lines will help provide the company's customers with quicker access to their content and increased capacities. Hence, the considerable growth of digital data and growth in the relevant market leading to higher demand for storage are likely to drive Seagate's near-term financial results as it innovates to effectively address emerging factors.Return to Shareholders and Concluding RemarksThe following chart illustrates Seagate's dividend per share history over the past two years. The company raised its dividend from $0.18 per share distributed in Q2 FY 2012 to $0.43 per share paid in Q2 FY 2014.Source: STX Fiscal Q2 2014 PresentationIn addition to higher dividends, the company is also spending cash to buy back shares, as shown in the following chart.Source: STX Strategic Update 2013Currently, Zack's ranks the company as buy. On average, analysts forecast Seagate will post EPS of $5.11 for FY 2014, up from $4.81 earned in FY 2013.The company is capitalizing on the rapidly growing data storage industry. The demand for data storage drives with bigger storage capacities, enhanced performance, and low cost is set to rise. Global internet penetration, the rise in e-commerce in emerging markets, and move to high-resolution media standards are drivers of the rise in global data and thus the need for more storage devices. Seagate's recent launch of Enterprise Capacity 3.5 HDD v4 is acclaimed by the company's partners. The drive not only has high capacity, but is built to perform faster and ensure accurate and secure data storage to prevent data loss even in harsh environments. The drive is also cost effective and saves power making it more suited to customers' preferences.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Gemstone Equity Research research analyst.

2067543,23479,2014-03-04T18:40:22-05:00,,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) recently unveiled its seventh generation surveillance drives, which primarily target small and medium businesses (SMB). Seagate’s primary competitor Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) also debuted its surveillance class hard drive under the WD Purple brand name. The surveillance market has been on a strong growth spree over the last decade, with major corporations and governments opting for video surveillance of their premises. The growing need for security and surveillance is not only seen in developed countries, but also in emerging markets across some parts of Europe and Asia.Surveillance storage can be split into various storing technologies, including network attached storage (NAS), unified storage, storage area network and digital video recording (DVR). A major portion of video surveillance is done on a large scale with surveillance companies using big data, NAS, SAN or unified storage solutions offered by providers such NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and EMC (NYSE:EMC). High security risks, coupled with technological advances in security systems, have prompted even the small-scale businesses to deploy surveillance systems. Seagate is now looking to provide DVR-based storage solutions for small scale/in-house surveillance systems. Casinos and manufacturing plants are among the various small and medium businesses that the company intends to target for this purpose. As the demand for surveillance in SMBs increases over the next few years, Seagate could derive meaningful growth in its non-compute storage segment from surveillance storage. However, adoption of video-surveillance-as-a-service (VSaaS) and IP-based surveillance (which means surveillance over a network) offered by third-party providers could reduce demand for small-scale/in-house surveillance in the long run.Storage Breakdown in Video SurveillanceTraditional video surveillance consisted of installing cameras at strategic locations with most of the monitoring done manually. Over time, the high cost of employing manpower and a high frequency of overlooked events caused the shift towards storing video footage. According to a report published by Transparency Market Research, the global video surveillance market is about $15 billion at present, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 19% through 2019 to $43 billion. Recording and video storage currently accounts for about 35% of entire surveillance hardware market, the report adds.However, video-surveillance-as-a-service (VSaaS) and IP-based surveillance offered by surveillance providers decrease the requirements of individual storage units in surveillance systems. The entire shift of IT centered around infrastructure to IT-as-a-service is bolstered by cost-cutting benefits due to the low initial investment and maintenance costs and manageable technical expertise required. As a result, the shift of in-house surveillance to VSaaS, cloud-based storage and surveillance over a network appears inevitable. An estimate by Markets and Markets highlights a similar trend. According to their research report, video surveillance storage market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 16% to become a $10 billion market by 2018. Given the expected overall surveillance market size, the share of surveillance storage could decline to about 27% by 2018.Seagate’s Surveillance DrivesSeagate’s new surveillance drives offer storage solutions to primarily small- and mid-level surveillance systems. Seagate touts that its drives work flawlessly for at least one million hours before failure, a strong claim given that surveillance-class hard drives are used 24 hours a day, compared to regular HDDs that typically run 8 hours a day. Additionally, the new drives can record video footage from up to 32 camera channels, which is an ideal number for small-scale surveillance.It is likely that hard disk manufacturers Seagate and Western Digital tap into the SMB surveillance storage market space over the next couple of years and witness a near-term increase in sales of non-compute units. However, the anticipated growth in VSaaS and IP-based third-party surveillance options in the long run could trickle down to all market segments, including small-scale surveillance. Consequently, the use of these storage drives designed by Seagate specifically for use SMBs could ultimately become redundant. Taking a moderate assumption, if the overall non-compute units outsell our forecasted figures by 3-4% in the next two years, we could see an upside of only about 2% to our $51 price estimate for Seagate. However, the company could benefit in the long run if it shifts focus towards enterprise-level hardware storage arrays for the surveillance market.Disclosure: No positions."

Its principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs.• Seagate has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 16.2% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 0.9 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 44.3%.• The markets Seagate competes in are intensely competitive. The firm not only bumps heads with rivals for a limited number of major disk drive customers but also competes with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide flash memory and SSDs.• The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 3.1%. We expect the firm to pay out about 32% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital - ROIC - with its weighted average cost of capital - WACC. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Seagate's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 87%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.3%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Seagate's free cash flow margin has averaged about 18.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Seagate, cash flow from operations increased about 141% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 7% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisThe estimated fair value of $64 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 13.3 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8.4 times last year's EBITDA. We see pricing upside on the basis of our fair value estimate of Seagate. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of -0.8% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 8%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 17.9%, which is above Seagate's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 0% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Seagate, we use a 10.3% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $64 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Seagate. We think the firm is attractive below $48 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $80 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Seagate's fair value at this point in time to be about $64 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Seagate's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $80 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $64 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2005891,22742,2014-02-09T00:27:06-05:00,,"Back to Part IIIn the first article of this series, I provided an overview of the strategy to protect an equity portfolio from heavy losses from a market crash of 30 percent or more. In Part II, I provided more explanation of how the strategy works and gave the first candidate company to use as part of a diversified basket using put option contracts. I also provided an explanation of the selection process and an example of how it can help grow both capital and income over the long term because it conserves capital during downturns without the need to sell your long-held equity positions. What I did not provide yet was a basic tutorial on options contracts, which I believe is necessary to make sure readers understand the basic mechanics and correct uses, as well as the risks involved when options are used speculation.In this article, I will provide the options tutorial as well as some links for additional information that I believe can be very useful. I will also provide another candidate stock for use in this strategy.I am not predicting a market crash. I want to make that clear. But bear markets are part of investing in equities and I find that taking some of the pain out of the downside helps make it easier to do the right things: select superior companies that have sustainable advantages, consistently rising dividends and excellent long-term growth prospects; and then hold onto to those investments forever unless one of the fundamental reasons we bought them in the first place changes. Investing long term works! I just want to help make it work a little better and be a little less painful.We are already past the average duration of all bull markets since 1929. Actually, by April of this year, the current bull market will have surpassed in length all but three bull markets during that time period (out of a total of 15). Thus, I have decided that it is time to start preparing for the inevitable next bear market. I intend to employ the strategy in four stages over the next few months which will allow me to average into the full position I intend to build. I do not know when the strategy will pay off, but experience tells me that we are probably within a year or two from needing to be protected. It is not fun to write about down markets, but the fact is: they happen. I don't mind losing five or ten percent or even 15 percent from time to time. But I do try to avoid the majority of the pain from larger market drops. To understand more about the strategy, please refer back to the first and second articles of this series. Without that foundation, the rest of the articles in this series won't make much sense and could sound more like speculating with options. That is absolutely not my intention. With that stated, I will now proceed to explain the basics of options.Options Basics for American style option contracts (there are also European style options which we are not using for this strategy)There are two types of options: calls and puts. When an investor buys a call option contract s/he has the right, but is not obligated, to buy 100 shares of a specific stock at a predetermined price (the strike price) at any time before the option contract expiration date. When an investor buys a put option contract s/he obtains the right, but is not obligated, to sell 100 shares of a specific stock at a predetermined price (the strike price) at any time prior to the expiration date of the option contract.When an investor sells an option (without having first purchased them) s/he is actually creating a security that did not exist before. This action is also called writing an option. When writing an option contract, the seller is giving the buyer the right to buy or sell 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price any time before the option contract expiration date. The buyer of an options contract must execute the option prior to expiration or the contract will expire worthless.When someone sells (writes) a call they are agreeing to sell to the buyer of the contract 100 shares of the underlying stock any time prior to the option contract expiration date at the strike price, but only under two circumstances: if the buyer executes their rights under the option (the phrase used to describe this action is often referred to as ""calling away the stock"") or if the stock price is above the strike price on the expiration date. In the latter case, most brokerages will complete this transaction automatically. It is important to note at this point that I would never recommend selling/writing naked calls (meaning writing calls without owning the underlying stock) because of the level of risk which is associated with such a speculative position.When someone sells (writes) a put they are agreeing to purchase from the buyer of the contract 100 shares of the underlying stock any time prior to the option contract expiration date at the strike price, but (once again) only if the buyer executes his/her rights under the option contract or if the price of the underlying stock is below the strike price on the expiration date. I actually do sell puts for specific purposes which has nothing to do with the strategy of this series. I have written extensively on this subject, so if someone would like to know more please leave a comment and I will provide a link or two.The price of each option contract is called the premium and is listed as the price per share. Each standard option contract represents 100 shares. Thus, the full price paid or received by the buyer and seller of each contract is the price/premium multiplied by 100. Example: one put option contract on Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) with an expiration of January 2015 and a strike price of $15 has a premium (as of the close on February 7, 2014) of $0.94. Since the contract represents an option on 100 shares of AMAT, the actual price per contract is $94.00 ($0.94 x 100).An option can be either ""in the money"" or ""out of the money."" A call option is considered ""in the money"" when the price of the underlying stock is above the strike price of the option. Conversely, a call option is considered ""out of the money"" when the price of the underlying stock is below the strike price of the option. A put option is considered ""in the money"" when the price of the underlying stock is below the strike price of the option. A put option is consider ""out of the money"" when the price of the underlying stock is above the strike price of the option.Investopedia has a good article that explains the basics of options and also has a nice article that explains the components of an option price: intrinsic and extrinsic (time value) values. I suggest you read that article before beginning to implement this or any other options strategy. It is very useful information.I need to stress that I use option only as part of a strategy. In this series I am explaining one way of using options to protect all or a portion of the value of an equity portfolio. I also use options to enhance my income from dividend paying stocks, to produce income on cash while I wait for a better entry point, to create synthetic stock positions to capture stock appreciation without actually owning the stock or to systematically lower my cost basis of long-term stock holdings. But I will stick to only the strategy of protecting your portfolio for this series. Options can be useful for those who take the time to understand the proper use of such tools.The next candidate stock comes from the technology sector. Not all tech stocks get hammered during recessions, but many do; and some drop much more than others. Technology stocks generally carry much less debt, so those companies that carry significant debt often tend to be more volatile during economic downturns. Another reason that some tech stocks take a beating is that those companies are dependent upon corporations and governments to update technology periodically for sales. When a recession hits, many of those customers postpone investing in technology upgrades, especially on the hardware side, until the economy begins to improve. Thus, those tech companies that depend on those regular upgrades by such customers see revenues fall and margins contract, especially in the early stages of a recession; at least during the first year when all the layoffs (huge one-time costs), inventory write-downs (also temporary) and other cost cutting decisions are implemented to right-size operations to match the changed environment. Most of those efforts have significant costs associated with them and, combined with reduced sales and decreasing operating margins, take a toll on the bottom line. Then there is the always possible threat of obsolescence due to newer, competing technologies, especially for commodity products. High beta stocks abound in this sector. Once again it is really a matter of finding the weakest of those that tend to be the most cyclical in nature.Hard drives for data storage is a commodity business now, but continues to have growth prospects due to the continuing surge in data creation and storage. However, it is also a very competitive industry where even the slightest advantage can lead to a significant swing in market share and revenue. Things have been relatively stable for a few years but a recent event has set the stage for change. More on that in a moment.Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX) was involved in a leveraged buyout in 2000 during which the software portion of the company was sold. The new company went public in 2003 at $12 and rose to $31.80 later that same year only to fall back to $10.10 in 2004. The company's stock then climbed up to $28.90 at the top in 2007 and fell during the Great Recession to a low of $3.00 in 2009. Value Line lists the beta on STX as 1.35 while Yahoo Finance reports a beta of 3.14. Yahoo's calculation is the more current and reflects the most recent sell off in the stock. The stock performed extremely well (until recently) since late 2011, jumping up from $9.00 to a recent high of $62.76 achieved this January. The stock is currently trading at $49.52 (as of the close on Friday, February 7, 2014).Seagate has a debt-to-capital ratio of 43 percent which is high for the tech sector but it does have a strong cash position and has been paying down debt while also buying back shares. The dividend is currently $1.72 per share producing a yield of 3.3 percent. But the company cut its dividend in 2008 and then suspended the dividend in 2009 only to reinstate the dividend in 2010 at a higher level. The stock price reacted accordingly falling nearly 90 percent from the 2007 high to the low in 2009. Revenues fell, earnings turned into a loss, margins dropped, and capital investment fell. I see no reason to believe that results will improve in the next recession.We have already had a little taste of what can happen to STX if the market turns lower. STX has fallen by 21 percent in less than a month! I attribute much of this negative activity to a recent study by Backblaze which I came across in this article on Seeking Alpha. Whether the U.S. economy sinks into another recession or not, I have a hunch that STX stock is likely to fall some more as customers decide to seek a more reliable alternative. I expect that, during a recession, STX stock could easily fall below $20 a share, especially when the additional impact of the negative study results are included into the forecast. STX is likely to be forced to lower its price in a commodity business to retain customers. Alternatively, the company could attempt to retain its pricing which I would expect to result in a loss of market share. Either way, STX margins are likely to take a beating and the bottom line will suffer.The sweet spot in put options on STX, by my calculation, is January 2015 expiration contracts with a strike price of $30 and selling for a premium of $0.71 per share ( as of the close on Friday, February 7, 2014). However, since the shares are down the bid and ask prices on the contract are above the last trade price at $0.85 bid and $0.90 ask. Thus, I will use $0.90 for the example to remain conservative. Each contract represents an option to sell 100 shares and will cost $90 (plus commissions). If the share price falls to $20 or less by January 2015, the potential gain is $910 per contract, or just over 1000 percent.If the price falls below $20 with several months left before expiration and we decided to unwind the hedge, we may not be able to capture 100 percent of the potential due to the extrinsic value (time value) that would remain. However, we would be able to capture most of the potential gain. Likewise, if the price falls below $30 but remains above $20 by the expiration date, we would only capture a portion of the potential gain. And it is always important to remember that if the price of the underlying STX stock remains above the $30 strike price through the expiration date, we may lose 100 percent of the amount invested in the options contracts as protection.My feeling is that, due to the uncertainty of how much longer this bull market can be sustained and the potential risk versus reward potential of hedging versus not hedging, I would prefer to risk a small portion of my capital (perhaps five percent) to ensure that I hold onto the rest rather than risking losing a much larger portion of my capital (30 percent). But this is a decision that each investor needs to make for themselves. I do not commit more than five percent of my portfolio value to an initial hedge strategy position and have never committed more than ten percent to such a strategy in total. The ten percent rule can come into play when a bull market continues much longer than expected. And when the bull rages on longer than it should the bear that follows is usually deeper than it otherwise would have been. In other words, I would expect a much less violent bear market to occur if it begins in 2014; but if the bull can sustain itself well into 2015, I would expect the results of the next bear market to be more pronounced. If my assessment is correct, protecting a portfolio becomes even more important as the bull market continues.As always, I welcome comments and will try to address any concerns or questions either in the comments section or in a future article as soon as I can.

2017911,25289,2014-02-13T09:24:26-05:00,,"In this article, I will feature one tech stock that has seen intensive insider selling during the last 30 days. Intensive insider selling can be defined by the following three criteria:Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) designs, manufactures, and sells electronic data storage products.Insider selling during the last 30 daysHere is a table of Seagate's insider-trading activity during the last 30 days by insider.There have been 91,498 shares sold by insiders during the last 30 days.Insider selling by calendar monthHere is a table of Seagate's insider-trading activity by calendar month.There have been 35,295,548 shares sold, and there have been 1,742 shares purchased by insiders since January 2013.FinancialsSeagate reported the fiscal 2014 second-quarter, which ended December 27, financial results on January 27 with the following highlights:Seagate's revenues peaked 12 months ago, but the stock price has advanced 47% during the last 12 months.OutlookIn the fiscal 2014 third quarter, Seagate expects to achieve at least $3.4 billion in revenues and to maintain non-GAAP margins approximately flat sequentially.CompetitionSeagate's competitors include SanDisk (SNDK), and Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC). Here is a table comparing these companies.Seagate has the lowest gross margin among these three companies.Here is a table of these competitors' insider-trading activities during the last 30 days.SanDisk has also seen intensive insider selling during the last 30 days.ConclusionThere have been four different insiders selling Seagate, and there have not been any insiders buying Seagate during the last 30 days. Two of these four insiders decreased their holdings by more than 10%. Seagate has an insider ownership of 4.10%.Before going short Seagate, I would like to get a bearish confirmation from the Point and Figure chart. The two main reasons for the proposed short entry are negative revenue growth, and the intensive insider-selling activity.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1991411,22018,2014-02-04T10:17:54-05:00,,"After three years that the stock market showed nice gains in the month of January, the first month of this year disappointed many investors as the S&P 500 Index declined 3.56%, the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.74%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 5.30%.There is a market conviction; as goes January, so goes the year. Although statistically it has been true at 71% percents of the 35 last years, in some years it behaved just the opposite as shown in the table below, personally I would ignore this signal and focus on looking for leading companies that their stocks have recently significantly declined after a disappointing earnings report.I see the two market leaders Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) as such companies and I think that these two stocks are still a bargain at the current price for long-term investors.AppleApple announced its first-quarter fiscal 2014 earnings report on January 27, and although it beat analysts' EPS consensus by $0.43 and its revenue exceeded Wall Street's target by $130 million, its stock fell 8% the next trading day and another percent later. Investors' disappointment was caused by the fact that the company sold ""only"" 51 million iPhones during the quarter, which was below Street expectations ranging from 54 million to 56 million. Apple's outlook for revenue in the current quarter in a range of $42 billion to $44 billion was also below consensus for $46.1 billion.The company ended the quarter with $158.84 billion in cash, equivalents, and long-term investments, and $16.96 billion in long-term debt, or $142 billion in net cash. Although Apple returned $7.7 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the December quarter, Carl Icahn and other investors are continuing to put pressure on the company to escalate its share repurchase plan. I think that the fact that Apple's management is resisting the external demand to increase its share repurchase program is an indication that the company see strong growth prospects ahead, the company is continuing to invest heavily in new products and CEO Tim Cook has promised that Apple will come out with products in entirely new categories this year.Now let's look at the numbers, Apple has recorded exceptionally strong revenue and EPS growth during the last five years. The average annual sales growth for the past five years was extremely high at 35.45%, and the average annual EPS growth for the past five years was unusually high at 42.44%, only Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) among S&P 500 tech stocks has recorded combined stronger results; average sales growth of 96.02% and average EPS growth of 64.38%. According to Yahoo Finance, Apple's next financial year forward P/E is at 10.83 and the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next 5 years is at 19.58%, these give an extremely low PEG ratio of 0.55, only Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) among S&P 500 tech stocks has a lower PEG ratio of 0.48 (see my article about Lam Research). The PEG Ratio - price/earnings to growth ratio is a widely used indicator of a stock's potential value. It is favored by many investors over the P/E ratio because it also accounts for growth. A lower PEG means that the stock is more undervalued.As a devoted user of Apple products; iPhone, iPad and iTunes, I believe, in contrast to many doubters, that Apple has not lost its ability to grow, its products are the best in the market, and exciting new products will come out soon. In my opinion, it is now a rare opportunity for a long-term investment in such a great company at a remarkably cheap price.Seagate TechnologySeagate announced its second-quarter fiscal 2014 earnings report on January 27, results were slightly below expectations, with guidance also a bit lower. Seagate experienced slowing growth in its cloud storage business, in the recent quarter. According to the company, weakness in the cloud business was due to long-term rollouts by some of its original-equipment manufacturer customers, OEMs had accounted for about 68 percent of the company's total revenue as of June. Seagate and rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) are tapping into the growing demand for products that help store data in the cloud and reducing their dependence on personal computer hard drives as consumers shift to smartphones and tablets. Second-quarter EPS came in at $1.32, a $0.06 below analyst expectations, and revenue fell almost 4%, year over year, to $3.53 billion while consensus expectations were for $3.56 billion. For the third quarter, Seagate expects revenue of at least $3.4 billion, a bit short of analysts' forecast sales of $3.46 billion. The hard drive maker also said that its gross margin will be relatively flat compared to the second quarter. Investors were disappointed to see that Seagate sales dropped while that of its rival Western Digital gained, and the stock tumbled 11.25% in the next trading day.I find the market reaction exaggerated, one slightly disappointed quarter does not change the fundamentals of a great company. Just consider Seagate's fundamentals; According to Yahoo Finance, Seagate's next financial year forward P/E is at 9.32, and the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next 5 years is at 12.50%, these give a remarkably low PEG ratio of 0.75. Furthermore, in order to compare Seagate's profitability and efficiency with other tech stocks, I ran the Portfolio123's powerful screener and I found out that, among all S&P 500 tech stocks only Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), have a combination of ROE+ROI+ROA greater than that of Seagate.Seagate is generating a lot of cash; its ttm price to free cash flow of 11.97 is among the lowest of all S&P 500 tech stocks. The company continued to deliver large sums of cash back to shareholders, during the second quarter the company generated approximately $856 million in operating cash flow, paid cash dividends of $142 million and repurchased 33 million ordinary shares for approximately $1.5 billion. Seagate has raised its payouts at an uncommonly high rate during the last five years; the annual rate of dividend growth was at 27.5%. The forward annual dividend yield is quite high at 3.30%, and the payout ratio is only 27%.I consider Seagate's stock as a good combination of value and growth dividend stock, and in my opinion, after the retreat in its stock price, it is now an excellent opportunity for a long-term investment in a good company at a cheap price.Disclosure: I am long AAPL, STX.

1976351,48501,2014-01-29T10:56:31-05:00,,"Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX) reported fiscal second quarter results, which were decent. The growth numbers aren't attractive, and the valuation is less attractive than the growth numbers. On the other hand, the firm increased its operating efficiency during the quarter. But there was a significant decline in shareholders' equity.Revenue came in at $3.5B with net income at $428 million. The share count declined to 336M from 347M. With free cash flow during the first six months of the fiscal year at $1.234B, FCF per share was $3.67. That said, the equity balance declined to $2.5 billion as the company repurchased $1.7B worth of shares during the first six months.When I look at the fundamentals and P/B of 7.82, I can't be bullish on this company. I continue to view Seagate as the weak link in electronic storage.Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummarySeagate Technology PLC is a leading provider of data storage products. Its principal products are hard disk drives, but the company also produces solid state hybrid drives, and solid state drives. Seagate's products are designed for multiple use cases, including (but not limited to) enterprise servers, mainframe and workstations, and client compute applications.STX generates most of its unit shipments from OEMs and distributors in the Americas and Asia Pacific. While ASPs have been flat recently, Client Compute unit shipments trended lower. But Exabytes shipped trended higher. Quarterly Client Compute unit shipments could be in the low 30 millions during fiscal 2014 and 2015, which would weigh on revenues as ASPs remain flat.Revenues increased 2% sequentially during the fiscal first quarter but declined relative to the year-ago reporting period. Gross margin and operating margin were flat sequentially. GAAP basic EPS increased 24% as the fiscal fourth quarter included a debt charge.Generally, operating efficiency improved during the fiscal second quarter. The receivables turnover ratio increased from 8.49 to 8.73 and the working capital turnover ratio increased from 4.72 to 4.75. Total asset turnover was flat at 1.55. Operating efficiency was solid during the quarter.The liquidity and solvency position diverged during the quarter. Liquidity was roughly flat from the prior quarter with the cash ratio at 0.95 and the current ratio at 2.15. The financial leverage ratio increased substantially from 2.54 to 3.57 as equity decreased. The solvency position is worth monitoring.Profitability was roughly flat during the quarter relative to the prior quarter. The gross margin came in just below 28% with the operating margin declining to 12.6% and the net profit margin roughly flat at 12.1%. It was a solid quarter on the profitability front.Revenue was roughly flat relative to the year-ago period and the prior period. Operating income declined significantly from the year-ago period ($555M v. $444M). But net income was flat relative to the first quarter. These were decent financial performance results but nothing to call home about.STX should create wealth for me during the next 12 months. I would charge the company 8% for my equity capital. The company should be able to add value based on my discount rate.RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in Seagate.Valuation & Portfolio ManagementThe share price of Seagate is in a bull market of primary degree as it has risen from $10 per share to just under $60. At this point, it is pretty safe to say that the rally is long in the tooth, from a technicals perspective.There isn't much of a diversification benefit from investing in STX, relative to the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY). The correlation since 2009 is 0.93. Since 2011, the correlation is 0.97. And since 2013, the correlation is 0.95. All three correlations are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, relative to zero correlation.Thus, variations in the share price of the S&P 500 explains a substantial amount of the variations in the share price of STX. Since 2009, the portion of the variation in the share price of STX explained by the share price of the S&P 500 ranged from 87% to 95%. Consequently, forecasts for the share price of STX should include forecasts for the broader market.Is STX likely to outperform the broader market? My model says, ""yes."" I place the chance of outperformance at 60%. Granted, that outperformance could mean STX declines less than the broader market.Including the recently released results, STX is trading at 7.82 times book value.

1998281,25047,2014-02-06T05:23:18-05:00,,"When it comes to financials, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) look pretty similar. In the last quarter WDC shipped 63.1 million HDDs at an ASP of $60 for revenue of $3.97 billion and operating profit of $478 million. STX, for its part, shipped 56.6 million units at an ASP of $62 for revenue of $3.53 billion and operating profit of $508 million (Source: WDC presentation; STX presentation).For this, WDC gets a market capitalization of $19.6 billion and a forward P/E of 9.7 times earnings (for the year ending in June 2015). STX has a market capitalization of $16.4 billion and trades at a forward P/E of 8.8 times (for the year ending in June 2015). Both companies also have similar revenue growth expectations for the year ending in June 2015 as well, with revenues expected to grow slightly more than 1% over that timeframe.These companies are thus very evenly matched, WDC is only slightly more expensive and both sell a commodity product, hard drives.While I am not going into the merits of investing in the hard drive business, I will however say something: There's a powerful reason to favor WDC over STX.The reasonA couple of weeks ago, online backup provider Backblaze published a study on HDD failure rates. Backblaze had already published similar studies in the past, but this time Backblaze actually separated failures by brand.And therein lies the problem. Seagate drives saw much larger failure rates than either Western Digital or Hitachi.This tremendous difference might have been influenced by the use of retail drives or even the positioning of the drives. But still, this is the info that exists, and such info is likely to inform HDD buyers in the next few quarters.As such, one would either expect volume or price pressure to affect Seagate. Since ASPs are very similar between STX and WDC, it's highly likely that HDD buyers will favor WDC (or Hitachi) drives at nearly the same price. So either STX accepts lower volume without affecting its prices, or STX will be forced to sell at a discount to make up for its perceived lower reliability.Both of these consequences would affect STX's revenues and/or operating profits. It might also amount to nothing, but given the very close valuation the risk is enough to warrant favoring WDC over STX.Seagate had no reaction to this study, no press releases were issued refuting its conclusions. As I said it was possible to ascribe the reliability problems to such factors as the fact that retail drives were used or the position they were mounted in. Still, what remains is the fact that this study was seen by many buyers and might influence their buying decisions in the next few quarters.ConclusionIn a very visible study, Backblaze identified significant reliability problems with STX HDDs. This is likely to drive either STX volumes down, or to force STX to sell at a discount. Due to this, and since STX trades at a very similar valuation to WDC, it makes more sense to hold WDC, without this obvious problem, than to hold STX, with this obvious problem.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1968891,23625,2014-01-27T05:05:57-05:00,,"Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX) is set to report FQ2 2014 earnings after the market closes on Monday, January 27. Seagate is a global leader in hard drive disks and data storage. They produce a variety of products including hard drives for laptops, external hard drives, as well as solid-state and hybrid drives. The industry is well contested and last week red hot competitor SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) beat Wall Street profit expectations for the 7th quarter in a row. SanDisk produces flash memory solutions which are faster, more durable, and are a smaller alternative to hard drives, critically- however- flash memory is more expensive. SanDisk has done well lately because as a producer of flash memory they have been positioned to take advantage of the smartphone boom.Seagate may continue to profit from hard drive sales over the next few years, especially if there is demand for hard drives in emerging markets looking for a cheaper data storage solution. On another front, Seagate has recently expanded its capacities in the solid state drives industry by acquiring Xyratex. Unlike traditional hard drives, solid state drives are completely electronic and don't use any actual disk or motors. While this acquisition only adds roughly 3% to the company's total revenue, they are expecting energy efficient solid state drives to play a big role in the PC industry going forward. Here's how the buy side expects Seagate to perform this quarter.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors(Click Here to see All Estimates for Seagate)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Seagate to report $1.40 EPS and $3.573B revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from 7 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is $1.40 EPS and $3.566B revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting Seagate to report in line with the Wall Street consensus on profit, but come up short on revenue.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing a small differential between the 2 groups' forecasts.Over the previous 6 quarters, the Estimize.com consensus has been more accurate than Wall Street in predicting STX's EPS and revenue 2 and 4 times respectively. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors, Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly -- it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus. The distribution of estimates published by analysts on Estimize range from $1.36 to $1.42 EPS and $3.520B to $3.590B in revenues. This quarter we're seeing a very small distribution of estimates compared to previous quarters.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A more narrow distribution of estimates signaling the potential for less volatility post earnings, as there is more agreement about how the company is expected to report.This quarter the Wall Street profit consensus has fallen from $1.42 to $1.40 EPS while their revenue forecast has fallen from $13.638B to $3.573B. The Estimize EPS consensus also opened the period at $1.42 and fell to $1.40 while the Estimize revenue consensus has dropped from a high of $3.597B to $3.566B. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy, and a decrease in the community consensus going into the report is often a bearish indicator. The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is blandau123 who projects $1.42 EPS and $3.580B in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season, blandau is currently ranked as the 45th best analyst and is ranked 181st overall among over 3,500 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. This quarter the estimate with the highest confidence score disagrees with the consensus from the Estimize community and predicts that Seagate Technology will beat the Wall Street consensus on both EPS and revenue.Disclosure: No positions."
1923531,23479,2013-12-31T16:30:12-05:00,,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) recently acquired Xyratex Ltd for $374 million. The news came at the end of the year which say Seagate’s major competitor, Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), acquiring a number of companies such as Virident, sTec and Velobit to bolster its SSD offerings. Seagate’s Xyratex acquisition targets enterprise storage which is likely to be a fast growing segment for the coming years.In the last couple of years the demand for PC and laptops has declined. Personal computer shipments have slowed for five straight quarters, which is the longest period for sustained decline. This has directly affected the hard disk manufacturers in terms of PC hard drive units shipped. However, the global requirement of data is growing at an immense rate – almost doubling every two years. As more data moves towards cloud and users become increasingly dependent on network attached storage or the cloud, there is a growing demand for big data centers and enterprise storage. Major players in the storage industry such as Western Digital and Seagate aim to improve their solid state drive (SSD) portfolio with better offerings and look to target enterprise storage going forward. Seagate’s stock rose by 75% this year and is currently trading at $56. The gain is attributed to a higher mix of high-margin SSD sales and a general shift away from traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). We currently have a $51 price estimate for Seagate which is 9% lower than the market price.Solid State DrivesSolid state drives have integrated circuit units that store data, unlike regular hard disk drives that have a rotating disk and a moving read/write head making them more prone to damage under physical shock. In addition, it is much faster to access and transfer data on the integrated circuit storage compared to a conventional rotating disk. The absence of moving parts also ensures that no noise is generated while using SSDs. Consequently, solid state drives consume less power than regular hard drives. All these reasons make SSDs a logical choice for replacing the traditional hard disk drives. Over the course of last few years, the significant growth in SSD numbers has contributed to a steep decline in SSD prices.Despite better performance, SSDs are unlikely to completely cannibalize traditional hard disk drives (HDDs), mainly because of the huge price gap between the two. In an attempt to deliver economical substitutes to more expensive SSDs, Western Digital recently announced the launch of its Helium-filled drive and its Black2 Dual Drive. Seagate exploring the option of Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) drives which it will launch next year. Seagate’s long term plan also includes a Heat Assisted Magenetic Recorded Drive, highlighting a similar trend. The Xyratex acquisition should enable Seagate to better test its SMR and HAMR drives.Xyratex AcquisitionSeagate’s major competitor, Western Digital, made key acquisitions in 2013 to boost its SSD sales. (Read more on Western Digital’s Stock Price Doubled in 2013) Close to end of this year, Seagate announced that it will acquire Xyratex for $374 million. The Xyratex acquisition benefits Seagate on two main fronts.Firstly, Xyratex is the largest hard disk drive processing equipment supplier with a portfolio that includes disk processing, inspection and testing equipment. Prominent hard disk manufacturers like Western Digital and Toshiba also use Xyratex equipment for testing and inspection purposes. This gives Seagate some leverage and pricing power over its competitors, though it remains tobe seen how they will use it. Xyratex has around 3 million test slots installed worldwide, with its Drive Processing Systems (DPS) enhancing factory yields for HDD manufacturers.Secondly, Xyratex has a storage hardware business with its ClusterStor range of high performance computing (HPC) and cloud storage platform. Additionally, Xyratex also has an enterprise data storage business with the OneStor brand of products ranging from embedded storage to storage application products. Xyratex’s ClusterStor and OneStor range of products make it the largest OEM storage disk manufacturer in the world with a major client base such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Dell and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP). Even though Seagate intends to operate the storage business separately to begin with, it gives Seagate’s customers a wider array of products to choose from.With growing data requirement, the average capacity per drive is constantly increasing owing to a growing number of multi-terabyte (1 terabyte = 1000 gigabytes) drives. Hence the time required for testing of these drives is also increasing. According to Seagate, the acquisition will help streamline its supply chain and give it access to hard drive capital equipment which in turn should help Seagate reduce costs and improve margins.Disclosure: No positions"
1888651,54342,2013-12-10T11:39:55-05:00,,"The quarterly results in the month of October seemed to bring to a halt the rally in the share price of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX). Operating in a fierce competitive business segment, the company observed a reduction in revenues by 6.51% and basic earnings per share plunged to $1.2 from $1.48 for the same period a year ago. On the other hand, its competitor has managed to upscale its revenue and the profits too have been good on account of high margin products. Steve Luczo, Seagate's chairman and chief executive officer, is quite optimistic as the prevalent opportunities in the core business (cloud, mobile and open source storage advancement) seem to be burgeoning. The share price is once again looking upwards after a short glitch in October (refer figure below).Figure: Movement in share price of Seagate in the last yearIf the words of the CEO are expected to materialize then we could clearly hint at where the share prices would be in the next few months.The Big Data IndustryIn an earlier report by International Data Corporation (IDC) there is going to be an emergence of the intelligent economy. The report also states that the Big Data technology and services will grow from $3.2 billion in 2010 to $16.9 billion (a CAGR of 39.4%). In a newly released forecast, IDC projects that the worldwide big data technology and services market will grow at a 31.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) with revenues reaching $23.8 billion in 2016.Figure: Worldwide Big Data Technology and Services Revenue by Segment (Source: IDC, 2012)It is clearly mentioned in the figure above that the contribution of storage forms 11.6% of this total chunk of revenue. Companies like Seagate Technology, Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) and San Disk Corporation (SNDK) are looking forward to boost up their market share in this segment. These players are constantly introducing newer technologies in data storage in order to outpace each other and the future in this industry will be determined based on the remuneration of the company. Seagate offers hard disk drives at nominal rates and it is expected that at the current rate of growth there may be a shortfall in the hard drive industry in 2015-16. While it is anticipated that Seagate might enhance this as a win-win situation to augment its growth, a major deterrent might be the inception of Fusion Drive by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and of WD Black2 dual drives that might compete with Seagate in terms of price estimates and performance as the speed offered is quite faster.Revenue Generation For SeagateWhile technology is a major determinant of success for the sector, the revenue channels along with the geographical distribution should be assessed in determining the future growth of Seagate. A lot can be apprehended from the revenue pattern of the companies functional in this sector. The following table provides us with critical information based on which we may draw certain conclusions.Table: Revenue by channel and geographySource: Seagate, 2012A bulk of Seagate's orders arrives from OEM manufactures. A characteristic of this channel is that it is reliable and bulky. While OEM contracts account for 72% of Seagate's revenue, this figure for Western Digital is only 63% of its total revenue. Retail channels require ""greater marketing support, sales incentives and price protection periods"" and, therefore, a lower share of this stream puts Seagate at a better position than Western Digital.Revenue according to geographical regions is another eminent aspect and the fact that a major chunk of it comes from a fast growing region heralds well for the company. Regions of America and Europe are already well-developed in terms of technology, hence, the required penetration in these regions may be low. Focusing on developing markets may be the key to the future. Unfortunately for Seagate this is no secret as its competitors have also realized this and their reach in these markets are comparable and the revenues by geography for both Western Digital and Seagate are almost similar.Fundamental Analysis On The Positive SideTaking a look at the valuation ratios we observe that there is scope for investment in Seagate (refer table below).Table: Comparison of valuation ratios of Seagate with the industryBeing considerably lower than the industry standard (except in case of Price to Book), the valuation ratios highlight that there is enough scope for the share price to rise in the future.Buy, Buy, Buy For SeagateAs a matter of fact, there is a general consensus that the hard drive industry is still yet to reach its zenith. While flash devices may be the future of database technology and Big Data storage, the cheaper alternative provided by Seagate should make the business viable for at least 2-3 years. The threat from emerging technologies may be prevalent but as long as the markets in emerging economies remain untapped it is very likely that the hard drive space will still be in huge demand. Seagate too is trying to provide alternatives that are as fast as its peers and with the price it offers there is likelihood that it may raise concerns for its competitors.The company is also looking to launch advanced high margin products through which it should be able to improve its bottom line in the succeeding quarters. It has also ventured into the flash memory segment by launching products like Seagate® 600 SSD, Seagate® 600 Pro SSD and the Seagate 1200 SSD which are characterized by greater speed and higher integrity. Unfortunately for the company, the price erosion in this industry has been a very decay.Figure: HDD Cost per GB, 1980-2009At current levels, the business may be sustainable for a few more years to come but there has to be a marked improvement in technology in the near future.Investors could expect to see the stock price rise from $51.42 to at least $60 in the next year. An investment horizon above one year could be too risky considering the dynamism prevalent in the storage industry.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Analysts at EurEx Consulting.

1915091,25120,2013-12-24T11:11:13-05:00,,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is making clear that its ambitions in the solid-state drive market might become serious as well following the acquisition of Xyratex (NASDAQ:XRTX).While the reported deal adds little to revenues and even less to earnings, it is important as a guidance for the future direction of the company.Just like its main rival Western Digital, shares continue to trade at attractive levels, notably in relation to GAAP earnings. As I am uncertain about future revenue and earnings developments, I remain cautious and stay on the sidelines despite the attractive valuation on GAAP earnings.The DealSeagate announced that it has entered into an agreement under which it will acquire Xyratex. Seagate will pay $13.25 per share, or $374 million for the company. The offer represents a 27% premium compared to Friday's closing levels.With the deal, Seagate will further boost its HDD ambitions, getting its hands on the capital test equipment business. This deal will further boost the integrated supply and manufacturing chain for disk drives, ensuring uninterrupted access to equipment.Seagate will furthermore expand into storage solutions as well as high-performance computing, as a consequence of the deal. Note that the actual presence is very limited however.Backing out net cash balances of $80 million on Xyratex's balance sheet on August of 2013, the net purchase price comes down to $294 million. The revenue contribution in the fiscal year of 2015 is seen between $500 and $600 million, valuing the operations at effectively 0.5 times annual revenues.The deal has been approved by the board of directors of Xyratex and is subject to normal closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval of shareholders of Xyratex. The deal is expected to close in the middle of 2014.ValuationSeagate ended its first quarter of its fiscal 2014 with $2.41 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. Total debt stands at $2.77 billion, resulting in a very modest net debt position. Given the liquidity available, Seagate should be able to easily finance the deal within existing means.For the fiscal year of 2013, Seagate generated revenues of $14.35 billion, down 3.9% on the year before. Earnings fell by nearly 36% that year to $1.84 billion.Trading around $56 per share, the market values Seagate at $18.2 billion. This values equity in the firm at 1.3 times annual revenues and 10 times GAAP earnings.Seagate pays a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 3.1%.Some Historical PerspectiveLong-term holders in Seagate have seen very strong returns, especially in recent years. Between 2003 and 2012, shares have traded in a $10-$30 trading range. Shares did see a short-term sell-off towards $3 in the middle of the financial crisis.Since 2012, shares have seen impressive returns, steadily increasing towards highs of $56 at the moment. Between the fiscal year of 2010 and 2013, Seagate increased its annual revenues by a cumulative 25% to $14.4 billion. Earnings rose by 15% in the meantime towards $1.8 billion. Earnings attributable to shareholders did see much more growth, as Seagate retired nearly 30% of its shares outstanding over this time period.Investment ThesisSeagate's acquisition of Xyratex is a drop in the bucket, adding roughly 3% in annual revenues. While this looks like big discount compared to Seagate's own valuation, note that the firm is struggling to break-even at the moment, while reporting heavy revenue declines.Yet it gives the company more access to hard disk drives after rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) has been on a buying spree in the area this year. Now it seems both companies aim to boost the presence in the energy efficient solid-state drive market, amidst a declining PC market. In September, Western Digital acquired Virident Systems in a $685 million deal, after buying STEC for $340 million earlier this summer.These moves are important as Seagate and Western Digital have created an affective duopoly following Western Digital's purchase of Hitachi GST, while Seagate bought Samsungs' HDD business back in 2011. The ""temporary"" hike in prices following the floods in Thailand, has remained, boosting earnings for the firms despite the PC-worries.It is these high margins and big exposure to the ailing personal computer market, with lack of exposure to growth markets, which are creating worries among investors. This is despite record high share prices as earnings multiples remain under pressure.For this reason, shareholders including myself remain in doubt. On the one hand, the valuation accompanied by sizable dividends and repurchases are very attractive. Long-term fundamentals, notably with increasing cloud-adoption can be called ""challenging"" at best.Not having great visibility on these outcomes, I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1862131,57571,2013-11-25T15:19:00-05:00,,"Seagate Technology (STX), one of the worldwide leaders in storage solutions, is facing headwinds due to declining personal computer sales. On October 28, the company reported its first quarter result for fiscal year 2014, where its net income slipped to $427 million, declining 27% year over year. Revenue also slipped 6% year over year to $3.49 billion. For the next quarter, the company is expecting revenue around $3.60 billion, which is less than the consensus of $3.64 billion. Due to PC's declining sales, the company is now concentrating on products for cloud storage firms and hard drives other than PC.Kinetic: the company's new breakthrough is paying offGlobal spending on data centers is estimated to reach $143 billion by the end of this year, and it may rise to $149 billion by the end of 2014. Also, enterprises are concentrating on cloud infrastructure instead of traditional hardware based storage because it reduces their physical space requirement. To capture this emerging market, on October 22, Seagate introduced Kinetic, an Ethernet enabled open storage platform.Kinetic will simplify data management and can reduce total cost of ownership, or TCO, of cloud computing infrastructure by 50%. Current data centers have multiple layers of software and hardware stacked together between an application and storage device. The Kinetic platform will remove these layers of hardware, and the application can directly interact with the storage device. It will help cloud service providers and independent software vendors reduce their expenses associated with acquisition, deployment, and support of storage infrastructures. It will also reduce power and cooling cost.For Kinetic deployment, Seagate has partnered with two open source companies, Basho Technologies and SwiftStack. Basho, which deals in distributed systems and cloud storage software, is in collaboration with Seagate for Kinetic platform's development stage. It has developed drivers for Kinetic, making it compatible for clients who use its product, ""Riak,"" as their storage system. More than one thousand companies use Riak; these include over 25% of Fortune 50 companies, which provide huge growth potential for Kinetic. SwiftStack, which builds cloud storage solutions for applications, has also collaborated with Seagate. Like Basho, it has also made its storage system compatible with Seagate's Kinetic platform.Other than these two companies, many big companies like Yahoo, Dell, Huawei, Hyve Solutions, Rackspace, and Newisys also have either started using Kinetic or have shown a positive outlook towards it and have publicly stated that Seagate's Kinetic is beneficial because it will help them expand their cloud storage operations as well as reduce their expenses. I am optimistic that these companies will also deploy Kinetic, which will help Seagate generate good revenue in the coming quarters.Peer ComparisonSeagate and Western Digital (WDC) have been competing with each other in data storage services for decades, but currently both are facing headwinds due to the weakening PC demand. Western Digital has also shifted its focus from PC and is now concentrating on products for cloud storage firms. To strengthen its cloud storage business, Western Digital acquired Virident Systems on October 17. It is a server-side flash storage provider for virtualization and cloud computing. Western Digital will integrate Virident with its wholly own subsidiary HGST. This acquisition will help HGST deliver better storage solutions to its enterprise customers. On the other hand, Virident is Seagate's important technology partner, and in January this year, Seagate invested $40 million in it to provide flash-based PCI solutions to its enterprise customers. Virident's acquisition by Western Digital can impact this relationship, and Seagate doesn't have another vendor for PCI solutions. This could negatively impact Seagate's enterprise business, which constitutes 39% of its gross profit.SanDisk (SNDK), the global leader in flash-based storage, is also giving stiff competition to Seagate and Western Digital. In July 2013, it invested in Panzura, which provides flash drive-based network attached storage, or NAS, solutions to enterprise companies to store data in the cloud. NAS solution will help SanDisk's customers reduce their administration, power, and cooling costs. With this investment, SanDisk can utilize growing opportunities in enterprise storage, as Panzura's NAS has various advantages over traditional NAS solutions.Company is financially strongAlthough Seagate's income has declined year over year, the company still has stable financial health. Its debt to equity ratio is 0.7539. Additionally, the company's interest expenses haven't increased over last year. This shows Seagate isn't looking for external financing. The company's cash and cashequivalents are also increasing quarter over quarter. As the company's Kinetic storage platform's demand is increasing, its liquidity will further improve.Seagate has planned to payout 70% of its annual operating cash flow in the form of dividend or share repurchases in fiscal year 2014. In the last quarter, the company repurchased 33 million of its outstanding shares worth $1.5 billion. The company also increased its quarterly dividend to $0.43.If I compare the forward P/E of these three companies, Seagate is better placed, and its EV/EBITDA is also better than SanDisk. Hence, Seagate is reasonably valued with respect to its competitors.Considering all above factors, I would recommend shareholders to enter this stock, as these levels still look lucrative.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Their main products, hard disk drives, sold to original equipment manufacturers, are characterized by unstable and unpredictable product demand; rapid technological changes and product obsoleteness; rapid imitation and market saturation; price and margin erosion; and a constant threat from alternative products. Nonetheless, the two companies have survived and thrived. And Wall Street has taken notice, as the stocks of both companies have outpaced the S&P500 by a wide margin. How did they do it?By acquiring ailing and genuine competitors; and by forging collaborations with customers and competitors.Acquiring ailing competitors allowed both companies to amass the right scale and market share fending off price erosion. meanwhile, the acquisition of genuine competitors allowed them both to expand into emerging market segments. Seagate Technology, for instance, acquired Conner Peripherals in 1996, Maxtor in 2006, and Samsung's hard drive business in 2011. Western Digital acquired Read-Rite Corporation (2003), Komag (2007), Hitachi Global Technologies in (2011), and Virident Systems (2013).That's how the two companies managed to amass a near 87 percent of the market, with combined revenues of $30 billion dollars; and to expand into storage industries like flash memory, an emerging market segment of the disk drive industry.List of AcquisitionsSource: Corporate reportsMarket Shares for HDSource: Backupworks.comSeagate's And Western Digital's FinancialsSource: Finance.yahoo.comThe second strategy employed by both Seagate and Western Digital was forging collaboration with customers and competitors for the promotion of storage products. In 2008, for instance, Seagate forged a collaboration agreement with HarmanBecker for Automotive Media Server Applications Using D.A.V.E.(NYSE:TM) Technology. In 2012, Seagate announced a cloud storage business alliance to target engineering and marketing at cloud. In 2013, Western Digital forged a collaboration agreement with SanDisk to develop hybrid disk drives, known as SSHDs-a fast-moving market. In the same year, Seagate, HGST, Toshiba and Western Digital team up to form The Storage Products Association (NYSE:SPA) to promote hard drive technology.Which stock is a better bet for the future?It is hard to decide, as the two companies display similar financials and market shares. Nonetheless, I would bet on Western Digital, as it is better positioned to benefit from the fast-growing flash memory disk market.A few words of caution: Winning through acquisitions and collaborations has its own limits. Acquisitions may become increasing expensive, while collaborations may turn sour. That's why I would be very careful in investing in the two stocks, especially after the strong run up in the last twelve months.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Since the last time that I wrote about the company, the share price is pretty much flat at $50 per share.STX Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsSince that time, Seagate reported an EPS decline of 19% in the first fiscal quarter relative to the year-ago quarter. I think that this is a trend that is likely to continue throughout the fiscal year as Seagate reported 2013 EPS above normalized EPS. Additionally, I think the median EPS estimate for fiscal 2014 is too high as first quarter EPS declined 19% and second quarter totaled revenue is forecasted by management to be flat. Thus, the back half of 2014 would have to be exceptionally strong for Seagate to meet the current forecast.I continue to think of Seagate as a short sale candidate; I am waiting for a catalyst to get short shares. My intrinsic value estimate is $46.83, but I could lower it to $40 following second quarter earnings.Recent DevelopmentsFundamental AnalysisFrom a product perspective, management is focused on generating revenues from SSD and shingled magnetic recording technology. This is as unit shipments flatten and exabytes grow. I think the consumer PC market will remain weak and dampen demand for HDDs, but the enterprise storage market will offset some of that weakness.STX EPS Diluted (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsSeagate's management is expecting fiscal Q2 revenues in the $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion range; this compares with revenues of $3.67 billion in the year-ago quarter. The revenues forecast suggests to me that I am being too generous with the company's intrinsic value estimate, but I will maintain my EPS forecast of $5.26 for now. A hypothetical alternative intrinsic value estimate would be closer to $40 per share.For fiscal 2014, I'm forecasting revenues between $11.11 billion and $15.21 billion, which is an expanded range relative to my previous forecast. The difference is attributable to the model inputs. The low end of the range is 22.6% below fiscal 2013 revenue, which is attributable to forecasting confidence. On the other hand, revenues could increase 6% or more next fiscal year.In fiscal 2016, I'm forecasting revenues between $12.3 billion and $16.8 billion. The fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2016 forecasts will be dependent on the results of the Client Compute segment. On the low end, revenues would decline at a CAGR of 5%; the high end suggests a CAGR of 5.4%.All else equal, the share price downside should be limited by the share repurchase program: a revenues decline may not have a severe adverse impact on the share price of Seagate.Overall, Seagate returned too much capital to shareholders in previous years and did not strengthen its competitive position enough, which resulted in sub-competitive revenues growth. I think of Seagate as a weaker link in the storage industry chain.ValuationI'm going to use the multiplier model to value the common equity shares of Seagate. I'll use Seagate's 5-year average P/E and the S&P 500 as benchmarks. The S&P 500 valuation suggests Seagate is undervalued. But the company's EPS forecast could be revised lower during the fiscal year; consequently, relative to its 5-year average, Seagate is overvalued. If the share price rises above $52 and there is a short sale catalyst, Seagate is a short sale candidate.According to The Fed Model, the justified P/E for the S&P 500 is 35.34. The forward P/E for the S&P 500 is 16.5. Thus, The Fed Model suggests that the S&P 500 is currently undervalued by 114%; this means that I'm not comparing Seagate to an overvalued asset. I estimate that Seagate is trading at 9.67 times next twelve months earnings; Seagate is 70.6% undervalued relative to the S&P 500 on a forward basis.STX PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsThe 5-year average price to earnings ratio is 8.1 and the current P/E is 11. The premium that investors are paying for earnings of Seagate is partly attributable to the decrease in financial risk. Consequently, for use in my estimate, I'm subjectively revising the 5-year average P/E upward by 10% to 8.91 because of the decrease in leverage.For fiscal 2014 and 2015 respectively, the median Wall Street EPS forecasts are $5.36 and $5.86. I'm lowering the forecast to account for first quarter results; thus, my forward EPS is $5.26. In other words, I think the median forecast will be revised lower. Using the adjusted 5-year average P/E, I estimate the intrinsic value as $46.83, which means that Seagate is overvalued at $50.89 per share. But I don't think that the mispricing, if present, is large enough for investment purposes.If Seagate continues to trade higher and we get a catalyst for selling, Seagate is a short sale candidate at $52 per share and above.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

This makes me think that I should have bought into the dip the last time I wrote about Seagate, which was in August. You cannot win them all.STX data by YChartsThat said, in this report I update and extend my analysis of Seagate. I include a fiscal 2016 revenue forecast and a portfolio management section. Seagate should continue to face a headwind from the slumping PC market, but the share repurchase program should offset this headwind.I'm not going to purchase shares of Seagate with the share price being at a bull market high, but one of these weekends I will probably model a short position to determine the potential ROI.Recent DevelopmentsFinancial Performance Forecast & ValuationsOf the three operating segments -- Enterprise Storage, Client Compute, and Client Non-Compute -- Client Non-Compute is a revenues tailwind and Client Compute is a revenues headwind; the net impact should be declining revenue, but acquisitions offset some of the effect.For fiscal 2014, I'm forecasting revenue between $11.11 billion and $15.21 billion, which is an expanded range relative to my previous forecast.

Relative to its five-year average valuations, Seagate is overvalued. On a multiplier basis relative to Western Digital, Seagate is overvalued. Consequently, using the multiplier models, Seagate is overvalued.Overall, the valuations and the financial performance forecast favor being long Western Digital. At the right price, I would accumulate shares of Seagate.Portfolio ManagementSeagate is trading in a bull market of primary and intermediate term degree. The bull market of primary degree is nearing an end.Seagate's share price has been increasing at a compound monthly rate of 4% since March of 2009, which is unsustainable.The return distribution, since March 2009, is positively skewed and lacks tail risk.The bull market of primary degree has lead to valuations that are nearing extremes and a rate of share price appreciation that is unsustainable. Buying shares of Seagate at this point is like trying to jump into a moving car, it is not a good idea. If you are already in the car, good for you.

1720722,27221,2013-09-30T10:30:34-04:00,,"I tend to prefer stable, low-volatility companies when researching for my dividend portfolio, but sometimes a more-volatile alternative is simply too cheap to ignore. One such company is Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), the well-known maker of hard drives. With substantial upside potential and an excellent dividend yield, this company might be an excellent way to take advantage of the overblown fear of declining demand for personal computers.A little about SeagateSeagate is one of the largest hard drive manufacturers in the world, and is one of the industry pioneers. In fact, Seagate produced the world's first 5.25"" hard drive in 1980, and has shipped over 2 billion hard drives all over the world since then. Over the years, Seagate has been a technological leader, introducing the world's first 7200-rpm, 10,000-rpm, and 15,000-rpm hard drives in 1991, 1996, and 2000 respectively. Just a couple of years ago, Seagate introduced the first 4 Terabyte single-disk hard drives to the market.Now, the point of all of that is not to give you a history lesson. The point is that Seagate is an innovator and has proven time and again that it can evolve technology quicker than its competitors. There has been lots of concern among investors and analysts that demand for PCs (and the hard drives that go in them) will drop dramatically in the coming years. I think these fears are overblown, and that tablets and smartphones will co-exist with PCs more than they will replace them.With smartphones and tablets becoming more and more prevalent, the buzz in the memory world is that solid state storage is the future of the business, and that traditional hard drives are a thing of the past. While solid state has its advantages, such as faster performance and lower power usage, they are simply not cost-effective enough to justify their use in desktops and laptops, especially when several terabytes of storage are needed.Yield and other numbersSeagate pays a very healthy dividend yield of $0.38 per share, which translates to a 3.49% annual yield at the current share price. Despite being one of the highest-paying stocks in the sector, the dividend represents just a fraction of the company's profits. Seagate earned $4.81 per share in fiscal year 2013 and paid out $1.40 in dividends, for a payout ratio of just 29%, which is remarkably low for such a high paying stock. The company is projected to grow its earnings to $5.31 for the current fiscal year (2014), and even further to $5.88 next year.This is significant for two reasons. First, it means that earnings are rising faster than the company is raising its payout. This year's dividends which will total $1.52 represent a 28.6% payout, meaning that the dividend is indeed sustainable and further raises are likely. Also, this means that Seagate trades for a ridiculously low P/E of just 8.2 times forward earnings. This leads me to believe that the potential downside is relatively limited, even if earnings growth slows considerably in the coming years.An interesting proposal …While Seagate and its dividend offer enough reward potential for most investors, I think there is a particular advantage to Seagate that could allow us to boost our returns. Due to the relatively high volatility level of the stock, options tend to trade at a premium. With low volatility stocks, selling an option far out of the money doesn't produce much of a return. Not so for Seagate …My favorite way to play it is to buy the stock and sell a January 2015 $60 call against your position for $1.80. This provides protection on the downside by reducing your cost basis to $41.71 per share (current price minus the options premium), which is 4.1% below the current share price. When you factor in the $1.90 in dividends that you will receive before options expirations (5 quarterly payments), shares would have to close below $39.81 at expiration for you to lose money.It also provides significant protection against getting your shares called away, as the $60 strike price is well out of the money. A $60 price represents a 37.9% gain over the current price. Additionally, should Seagate climb above $60 and you get called away, you keep the options premium and any dividends you've collected along the way. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't mind taking a gain of over 40% in about 16 months and walking away with it.While I love Seagate as a stand-alone investment, this trade helps to swing the risk needle a little more in your favor, while raising the income you receive from the position to over 7.6% annually. Of course, if Seagate is below $60 at expiration, you're free to repeat the process and get even more income from this trade.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1724932,38201,2013-10-02T08:44:46-04:00,,"Despite the falling demand in the PC market, Seagate (STX) performed extremely well in its past fiscal year 2013. This is evident from the returns it provided. These were equal to 70% of its operating cash flows and 90% of its free cash flows, or approximately $2.1 billion in total. Understandably, this stock has always been a choice for income investors' portfolios.The company aims at achieving similar investor return targets for this fiscal year too. Although, growing competition from other industry players like Western Digital (WDC) make this expectation questionable. What fundamentals does Seagate possess that will support its goal and help it continue its present bull run?HDD shipments feeling the heat due to weak PC demandSeagate's hard disk drive, or HDD, shipments for desktops and laptops saw a negative impact of 4% in the second quarter of this year, on the quarter-over-quarter basis. Despite the fact that PC demand is expected to stabilize in the second half of this year, due to an enterprise refresh and consumer seasonality, we still believe growth in PC demand is quite uncertain on the long-term basis. This is primarily due to the rise in sales of smartphones and tablets. Since 44% of the company's sales come from PC sales, this will have a significant overhang on Seagate's HDD shipments.This decline in sales of HDD through PCs was offset by the growing shipments of its nearline drives, which led to a sequential growth of 3% in the enterprise segment of the company in the second quarter this year. Nearline storage is an intermediate type of storage device that is a compromise between online storage and offline storage. As per the IDC reports, by 2015 nearly two-thirds of compute devices will be smartphones and tablets, which will drive the growth in demand for cloud storage. Henceforth, this provides us with lot of confidence regarding the future demand for nearline storage.Going forward, we expect Seagate to continue this similar performance in fiscal year 2014, based on the growing number of applications shifting to the cloud. Most of the content is being created on smartphones and tablets, along with being stored in the cloud environment. Seagate's cloud business will benefit from the shift, as the company expects its cloud storage shipments to rise by 25% from 2011, to 60% by 2020. This means 450 exabytes of storage shifted to cloud and 2001, will grow to 6 zettabytes in a span of nine years.Acquiring smaller companies - a fixed mantraIn the storage industry, Seagate and Western Digital together have a market share of nearly 86% and combined revenue of about $30 billion, as of the second quarter of this year. History indicates that both companies have been highly competitive. However, Western Digital has maintained the No.1 position in this industry. It has a market share of 45% followed by Seagate's 41% market share in terms of HDD shipments, as of the second quarter of this year. To stay competitive in the market, these companies acquire smaller companies from the storage device industry, which helps enhance each company's product portfolio and expand its presence.Last month, Western Digital acquired Virident, which is a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express, or PCIe, card maker. It's an interconnection system between a microprocessor and attached devices, and provides expansion slots for high speed operations. Based on IDC's projection for the PCIe market to grow at an annual rate of 31% in the coming three years, Western Digital aims to capitalize on this huge opportunity and expand Virident's supply chain.Earlier this year, Seagate had struck a deal buying a stake worth $40 million in Virident. Through this deal, Seagate allowed Virident to use its OEM and distribution channels for its FlashMAX cards. This indirectly expanded Seagate's solid state portfolio. Although the company hasn't disclosed any details, it is known that Seagate is receiving a good return on this investment. This had led to speculation of Seagate considering acquiring Virident.The Western Digital - Virident deal, now questions Seagate's growth strategy going forward. This provides more confidence on the possibility of Seagate acquiring Fusion-io (FIO) in the near term. Fusion-io is a close competitor to Virident. It has been on the acquisition radar for nearly two years. It has a long list of clients like Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB), and other Internet giants like Alibaba and Pandora (P).Presently, the market value of Fusion-io is around $1.3 billion, trading at 2.5 times its revenue, posting over $432 million in the trailing 12-month period. This makes it bigger in terms of acquisition when compared to Virident. Given that Western Digital paid about 6 times the sales of Virident, the Fusion-io acquisition would be a much better deal for Seagate in terms of future market share growth and investment returns.'Buy' is the wordSince the Western Digital - Virident deal, the speculation surrounding the possible Fusion-io acquisition has led to a rise of over 8% in Seagate's market price since September 9, 2013. This reflects investor confidence toward the company's future prospects. Additionally, Seagate has been able to distribute cash, in the form dividends and share buybacks, over the past several quarters. This is mainly due to its strong cash flows, and given its positive fundamentals, we expect the company to continue this upward streak in its market price in the coming quarters also.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1739472,55382,2013-10-10T16:03:34-04:00,,"Since the HDD industry consolidated back in 2011-2012 when Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) acquired Hitachi GST and Seagate Technologies PLC (NASDAQ:STX) acquired Samsung's HDD business, the industry landscape has changed significantly. After the 2011 floods in Thailand that severely damaged HDD manufacturing facilities, prices of hard disk drives rose dramatically. Many claimed that inflated prices would plunge when capacity was brought back online, but they didn't. A de-facto duopoly had been formed and neither WD nor Seagate wanted to slash prices. And yet, a weakness of PC sales harmed the HDD TAM and consequently the duopoly revenues.The TAM was hurt so much that now WDC ships almost the same amount of drives it shipped in Q3-2011, before it acquired Hitachi. Although PC sales are plunging, exponential growth of data spurs new data centers that have massive storage needs. Let's take a look at WD and Seagate shipment data for the past 11 quarters.While unit shipments are stagnant, gross margins and ASP are much higher these days thanks to the help of the HDD duopoly.Although the market took some time to react to this fundamental change in the industry both companies' stock has risen more than 160% for Seagate and more than a 100% for Western Digital since January 2012. Both companies trade at a P/E of less than 10 on their pro-forma earnings. With all the information about the exponential growth of data, why aren't these companies valued with at least a P/E of 15? The answer is simple. Realized growth. As a rough rule of thumb, a PEG ratio of 1 means a company's growth is valued fairly. The big exposure to PCs and the lack of exposure to the mobile markets anchors the companies' revenues and profits in a close to constant level, thus the market values those companies at a lower P/E ratio.Where's the Growth?A lot was said about the so called ""death of HDDs"" and ""the rise of SSDs."" While I think the PC market will never go back to what it was in the past, it is way too early to talk about the death of the HDD. The price difference between a SSD GB and a HDD GB makes data center builders prefer HDDs for anything that isn't mission-critical. Most of the data we create becomes ""cold data,"" which means that most of it will never be accessed again. Yes, that forgotten video you made about your cat that is stored on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) servers just doesn't justify being stored on flash.WD and Seagate have both claimed over the past year that the near-mid term future lies in SSHDD or hybrid HDDs that use a small amount of flash, mainly for cache purposes with an HDD, thus gaining the speed advantage from the NAND and the cheap capacity advantage from the HDD. In the past few months we witnessed a flow of news about the prospects of hybrid HDDs in tablets. Even Seagate CEO Steve Luczo was heard talking about these prospects in the past few months.Seagate even demoed a tablet carrying an HDD. Before I'll move on with this article I want to comment about those who regularly claim that 500GB is just too much for you. As time passes, our minds can't perceive the amount of data we will need to store in the future. At one time in the not so distant past, everybody thought that 5MB was much more than anyone would ever need. I guess that 10-15 years ago even you thought that 5GB was way too much for you. Think about that again. I want to demonstrate the logic for the use of HDDs in tablets and then try to estimate the impact on WD and Seagate's business performance and financials.Does It Make Sense?Today we consumers suffer the most from the use of SSDs in tablets. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other tablet market leaders make a lot of profit from selling us small amounts of storage for a ridiculous price premium.The math shows us we pay $100 for the first 16GB addition (the default model is 16GB), and another $100 for an addition of 32GB more. The BOM shows us it costs the manufacturer, in this case Apple, about $16 to put in the tablet another 16GB, or just over $1 per GB. We pay for each extra GB (from the 16th GB to the 32nd GB) about $6.25 that comes up to more than 83% in gross margin on the storage part of the tablet, definitely a good business for the manufacturers. What is the alternative? Here it is.For $89 OEMs can build a tablet with 500GB of capacity. A tablet manufacturer can now lower its cost per GB to $0.18. Then, the manufacturer can charge us consumers about $0.36 per GB and still get 50% of gross margin on the storage part of the tablet while increasing the value proposition a lot, which can fuel volume sales. This is a strategy I believe many tablet manufacturers that want to take market share will adopt. This is what you can store on 500GB.I believe we will start seeing high storage capacity tablets hitting the shelves in the near future. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is launching the Surface 2 and Surface 2 Pro with up to 512GB of flash on October 29th. Yes you read it right, 512GB of flash. The Surface 2 Pro with 64GB is priced at $899 and the same tablet carrying 512GB of flash is priced at $1799 or $900 more. Those who'll buy the 512GB Surface 2 Pro will pay about $2 per extra GB (from the 64th GB to the 512GB). Manufacturers like Samsung, for example, which sells the Samsung Tab 3 for $299 with 16GB of storage, could use the 5mm SSHDD and offer a similar tablet with 500GB of storage for $459. A price point that I think will appeal to most ""storage hungry"" consumers.For those of you that are interested in comparing the performance of this 5 mm SSHDD to an SSD can read here.What is the Impact on TAM?The adoption of HDDs by the tablet industry could be a game changer for both WD and Seagate. I assume both companies will share the market for tablet HDDs at a 50/50 split. Also, I assume this big storage capacity tablet market will start as a niche and slowly take over the entire tablet market as the standard. Let's take a look at the PC and tablet markets' shipments forecast.To get a clear picture, I did a side by side market size comparison.Assumptions: PC HDD prices will decline 5% y/y and tablet HDD prices will remain stable. Tablet HDDS will have a 10% market share of the total tablet market in 2014 and will increase gradually.ConclusionIf the tablet story unfolds like I demonstrated both Western Digital and Seagate could experience growth in the next few years. The PC trend coupled with the future tablet business could support healthy growth, especially if you bring enterprise HDDs into the equation. With WD and Seagate valued at a P/E of less than 10 on their last annualized quarter pro-forma earnings, I think both stocks might have significant upside. Of course, we need to closely monitor this developing story. Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1559792,34821,2013-07-21T02:58:40-04:00,,"The earnings season continues in a big way this week, and I would like to focus on one of the smaller players, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), a data storage company which announced on March 12, 2013 that they were the first disk manufacturer to ship 2 billion hard disk drives. The first billion took 29 years to achieve (in 2008), indicating that growth in this segment of the industry is accelerating.STX has had a huge run-up of about 20% since its last earnings announcement on May 1st and hit a new high ($47.76) on Friday. This kind of price action suggests that expectations might be running a tad high going into the company's earnings announcement scheduled after the close of trading on Wednesday, July 24, 2013.Over the last several months, I have been testing the proposition that the level of expectations prior to an earnings announcement is a better indicator of what the stock price will do than the actual earnings themselves. I call it the Expectation Model. Basically, I examine recent stock price activity, estimates vs. whisper numbers, past post-earnings price changes vs. results, current RSI levels, and come up with a measure of whether expectations are unusually high or low.If expectations are unusually high, there is an excellent chance that the stock will be flat or fall after the announcement, regardless of how much the company might surpass estimates, and conversely, the stock is more likely to move higher when expectations are low, even if estimates are merely met. (Unusually low expectations are generally less predictive of higher post-announcement prices, however - unusually high expectations more reliably predict lower prices after the announcement).Last week I wrote a Seeking Alpha article entitled How To Play The Google Earnings Announcement This Week in which I showed how the model predicted that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) would fall after the announcement. It proved to be right. People who waited until after the announcement could have bought GOOG for as much as $50 less than the pre-announcement close (in after-market trading) or $14 less at the close on Friday. Anyone who followed the options spread I suggested should have made well over 50% for the day (at Terry's Tips, we waited until late Thursday and bought 915 calls in several different future series and sold 910 calls that expired the next day, and made an average gain of 58% after commissions on those trades).Going into earnings, STX seems to share many characteristics with GOOG a week ago. Here is the record of how STX has responded to earnings announcements over the last year (with the price change from just before the announcement until the Friday close after the announcement when the weekly options expired):The company doesn't have a great record of beating estimates. Half the time they have come up short, but in each case, the market didn't punish the company much. In fact, both times they failed to meet estimates, the shares managed to notch a small gain after the announcement.In the January 2013 announcement, actual earnings exceeded estimates by 8.7% yet the shares were clobbered by 10%. The company's chart yields an explanation of why that happened (adding support to our Expectation Model):Check out the sharply higher stock prices going into the January announcement. Expectations were clearly sky-high. Even though the company exceeded estimates by a large margin (after falling short for the prior two quarters), the stock was clobbered. Our model would have predicted just that kind of price action.In the month leading up to the May earnings report, the stock hardly budged. Expectations were presumably low. When actual earnings exceeded the estimates (by less than they had a quarter earlier), the stock got a big boost due to the reduced expectations.Option prices are predicting a move of about $3, or 6.3%, well below the size of the change in the past two quarters.This time around, expectations seem to be unusually high. Whisper numbers are higher than estimates, ($1.24 vs. $1.19), and the stock has enjoyed a dramatic run-up going into the announcement (and reaching a new high Friday).RSI numbers add even more support to this notion - at 94 and in a ""very overbought"" condition. Even if actual earnings are much higher than estimates and whisper numbers, it is doubtful to me that the stock will trade significantly higher after the announcement, and there is a very good chance that it might trade much lower if any part of the announcement (earnings, revenues, margins, or guidance) disappoint in any way.There is another bit of evidence suggesting that the stock may be headed lower. Institutional investors have sold 19% of their holdings over the past three months, going against the tide of steadily higher prices. The institutions are surely not always right, but with their superior resources, they are in a better position than any individual to be able to predict what is likely to happen next. And they are selling.Bottom line, if you would like to own Seagate, I would wait until after the announcement to make your purchase. If you are an options nut like me, I would buy a diagonal call spread with the buy side at a strike higher than the at-the-money Jul4-13 calls you sell. I would wait until late Wednesday to place the trade (although I plan to buy some of these spreads early in case the stock falls before the announcement like GOOG did last week). If you were to place that trade now (with the stock price at $47.52), you might buy Aug-13 48 calls, and this would be the risk profile graph if you assumed that IV of the August calls falls from 34 to 26 after the announcement:I think it is unlikely that the stock will move up by $2 after the announcement so that a loss on the upside would come about. On the other hand, the stock could fall by as much as 5% before a loss would be encountered on the downside. The maximum loss if the stock falls would be the initial cost (about $8 per spread) plus commissions. Each spread would involve a $50 maintenance requirement so the above 10 spreads would involve an investment of less than $600. A more aggressive bet that the stock will fall would be to buy the Aug-13 49 calls instead of the 48 calls - that spread could be placed for a credit and would guarantee a gain no matter how far the stock might fall (but would offer very little upside protection if the stock moved higher).STX has had a spectacular year so far, but it looks to me that it has gotten a little ahead of itself right now, especially since it has picked up over 20% since the last earnings announcement. The gain since the day before that announcement has been closer to 30%, a huge amount for a fairly mature company to chalk up in a single quarter.It seems clear to me that the stock is due to take a breather, and possibly fall back a fair amount once the numbers are revealed next Wednesday, even if the company manages to beat the estimates.Disclosure: I am long GOOG. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1631002,48501,2013-08-13T08:29:57-04:00,,"Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX) makes electronic storage devices. Most of the company's sales come from the Asia region. Seagate has three primary operating segments: Enterprise, Client Compute, and Client Non-Compute.Currently, Seagate is trading off of its recent high. Is it a good time for investors to accumulate shares?To determine if it is a good time to accumulate shares, I will analyze the risks, recent developments, business profile, financial performance forecast, and valuations.Seagate has had some periods of outperformance and some periods of underperformance, historically. That could mean that Seagate will continue to outperform, or Seagate will underperform.In my opinion, Seagate will face weakness from declining PC sales, but that will be partly offset by demand stemming from cloud computing and the introduction of a product line for tablets. Further, I think the Enterprise and Client Non-Computing segments will grow, but that will be offset by a lower average selling price. Thus, I think the company faces some top-line challenges in fiscal 2014.All of that said, based on my models, Seagate is fairly valued; I will consider purchasing shares if the share price falls 15+% (assuming the valuation stays the same).RisksRecent DevelopmentsSeagate announced it is shipping the world's fastest hard drive, the Seagate Enterprise Turbo SSHD. The Enterprise Turbo SSHD combines the capacity of a hard drive with solid-state flash, enabling high-speed performance for mission critical data.Business ProfileSeagate is a leading provider of electronic data storage products. Its principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness.Seagate produces a broad range of electronic data storage products including HDDs, solid state hybrid drives (SSHD) and solid state drives (SSD), which address enterprise applications, where its products are designed for enterprise servers, mainframes and workstations; client compute applications, where its products are designed for desktop and notebook computers; and client non-compute applications, where its products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as digital video recorders (DVRs), gaming consoles, personal data backup systems, portable external storage systems and digital media systems. In addition to manufacturing and selling data storage products, Seagate provides data storage services for small to medium-sized businesses, including online backup, data protection and recovery solutions.The principal markets served by the electronic data storage industry are: Enterprise storage, client compute, and client non-compute.Enterprise storage are those solutions which are designed for mission critical and nearline applications. The market for mission critical enterprise solutions could continue to be driven by enterprises moving network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings. Further, the market for nearline applications, those which include storage for cloud computing, content delivery and backup services, could continue to grow and drive demand for high capacity, energy efficient solutions.Client compute applications are solutions designed for desktop and mobile compute applications. The client compute market could continue to be driven by demand for cloud computing storage solutions. Economic growth and the increasing quantity of digital content should increase demand for client compute solutions.Non-compute applications are solutions designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage and network-attached storage [NAS]. Disk drives designed for consumer electronics are primarily used in DVRs and gaming consoles. The increase in the quantity of high definition content could drive demand for Seagate's non-compute solutions.In terms of product offerings, Seagate manufactures solutions for the enterprise storage, client compute, and client non-compute markets. The firm offers a broad range of HDDs, SSHDs, and SSDs that vary based on capacity and speed. These products are sold to OEMs, distributors and retailers, with OEMs comprising the largest portion of sales. Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Company accounted for 23% of sales in fiscal 2013.Seagate's primary competitors in the disk drive industry are Western Digital Corporation and Toshiba Corporation. Further, Seagate competes with companies that provide alternative storage technologies such as flash memory and SSDs used in mobile applications such as tablets, notebooks and lower capacity handheld devices in addition to SSDs used in enterprise applications for rapid processing and high volume transactions.Management believes that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store, aggregate, host, distribute, manage, backup and use such content. Management also believes that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world, the manner which hard drives are delivered to market and utilized by our customers will evolve as well.Seagate believes that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions, as well as the data intensive client non-compute markets, will continue to be best served by hard disk drives due to the industry's ability to deliver cost effective, reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices. Furthermore, the increased use of client non-compute devices that consume media rich content streamed from the cloud increases the demand for high capacity disk drives in nearline applications.The firm has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, intense competition from an independent disk drive manufacturer and a captive manufacturer. The term ""independent"" in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce disk drives as a stand-alone product, such as Western Digital Corporation, and the term ""captive"" in this context refers to a manufacturer who through affiliated entities produces complete computer or other systems that contain disk drives or other electronic data storage products, such as Toshiba Corporation.The captive manufacturer is a formidable competitor because it has the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components. As components other than disk drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do disk drives, the captive manufacturer does not necessarily need to realize a profit on the disk drives included in a complete computer system and, as a result, may be willing to sell disk drives to third parties at very low margins. The captive manufacturer is also a formidable competitor because it has more substantial resources than Seagate does. To the extent that Seagate is not successful competing with the captive or independent disk drive manufacturers, the results of operations will be adversely affected.Seagate also experiences competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory, where increasing capacity, decreasing cost, energy efficiency and improvements in performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with its lower capacity, smaller form factor disk drives. While this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications, these competitors have announced solid state drives for tablet, notebook and enterprise compute applications. Certain customers for both notebook and enterprise compute applications are adopting SSDs as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications.At the end of the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter, there was $903 million left in the share repurchase program. In an open market share repurchase program, cash is received by shareholders with concurrent sell orders. The repurchase program may be a sign that management believes that the shares are undervalued in the market place. Management could also be trying to offset the dilution of investors' interest because of the exercising of employee stock options. The share repurchases have been sufficient in size to reduce the amount of shares outstanding.A share repurchase program decreases assets and shareholders' equity and increases leverage. Also, earnings per share increases. The book value per share of Seagate declines with share repurchases.One of the biggest threats to this company is the lack of product offerings for the tablet and smartphone markets. But, Seagate believes that sales of drives for tablets will commence in the third calendar quarter and continue on from there. Thus, the company's new tablet offering could offset what I expect to be a less than stellar fiscal 2014.I think that the impact of declining PC sales will be seen in fiscal 2014. The PC sales decline significantly impacted PC manufacturers in calendar 2012 and 2013. The flood in Thailand offset the impact of the PC sales decline, through a higher HDD ASP. I think Dell and HP will order fewer solutions from Seagate in the company's fiscal 2014, which will adversely impact revenues and results of operations.For example, if the acquisition of Samsung's HDD business occurred in fiscal 2012, Seagate's consolidated revenue would have been $16.1 billion and would have declined to $14.4 billion in fiscal 2013. The acquisition masks the impact of declining revenues because of price erosion and less client compute unit shipments. Compute units sold, the PC solutions unit, declined, while non-compute units sold increased. Enterprise unit shipments were roughly flat.Financial Performance ForecastIn this section, I will forecast the unit shipments and average selling price. Also, I will include a forecast of revenue, operating income and net income. Finally, I will discuss the firm's use of cash.I'm looking for 31 or 32 million Enterprise unit shipments. I think the Client Compute segment will be adversely impacted by PC sales, but those declines will be offset by tablet and cloud computing product orders. Thus, I'm forecasting a 3% to 7% decline in unit shipment for the unit, or 140 to 147 units sold in fiscal 2014. Client Non-Compute shipments should increase to 50 units. I'm looking for an ASP of $58. Thus, revenue should be in about the $12.85 billion to $13.25 billion range. Fiscal 2013 revenue was $14.35 billion.I think the operating margin will be about 15% and the net income margin will be about 13%. So, operating income would be in the $1.93 billion to $1.99 billion range. Net income would be in the $1.67 billion to $1.72 billion range. Margins tend to be somewhat volatile due to changes in the cost of revenues. But, unless something changes, I think the margins will be flat compared to fiscal 2013 and roughly inline with fiscal 2010.In terms of cash usage, I think Seagate is returning too much cash to investors. Seagate should be reinvesting more of its cash into its business. Near term, returning cash could increase shareholders' value; long term, returning so much cash could make the business less competitive.I don't see solvency being an issue near term, but the company did report $6.07 billion of contractual cash obligations and cash of $2.2 billion.ValuationsI'm going to use a discounted cash flow model and a multiplier model to value common equity shares of Seagate. The current market price is $41.34.I think the dividend will increase to $1.66 in fiscal 2014. There are a substantial amount of assumptions that go into a discounted cash flow model. That said, based on the results of my model, the fair value of the common equity shares is $37.35, which is 10.7% less than the market price.Next, I will use the justified value to determine the fair value. My EPS forecast is just below the mean forecast of the street, but well within the range. That said, based on my model, I estimate the justified PE as 7.65. Thus, the fair value of the common equity shares using this model is $48.65.Now, I will use the historic average valuations to determine a fair value. The fair value using the price/earnings ratio is $51.52. The fair value using the price/book ratio is $25.37; using the price/sales ratio, the fair value is $22.55 and the price/cash flow fair value is $44.52. The average of those four fair values is $35.99.The average of the three fair value methods, and the fair value of the common equity shares, is $40.66. Consequently, Seagate is fairly valued at $41.34. So, I would use a 15+% decline in the share price to accumulate shares.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1607712,24757,2013-08-06T11:09:42-04:00,,"If you look at a long-term price chart for Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX), you will see a swoon in 2008 corresponding to the sell-off at the beginning of the Great Recession. You could buy STX in early 2009, for as little as $3.38 per share. After climbing up above $20 per share in early 2010, there was a second swoon to near $10 per share. This was based on the idea that a new technology, solid state drives [SSD] would wipe out all traditional hard disk drive [HDD] makers, including Seagate and its main rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).There are still people who hold to that thesis, even though years have gone by and HDDs are still manufactured and used in high volumes. As recognition of reality began to bull around the SSD hypothesis shares in Seagate recovered. Right now we are in a pullback, with Seagate near $40 in the first few days of August, after hitting a 52-week high of $47.82 on July 22, 2013.I believe that the amount of data being saved is continuing to see explosive growth and that Seagate is positioning itself to be competitive not just in HDD, but in SDD and in hybrid SDD-HDD drives as well. STX pays a dividend of $0.38 per quarter, giving it a 3.7% yield at $40 per share. Its P/E ratio is 8.4, meaning earnings are 11.9%. Even in stasis Seagate would be a good investment compared to government bonds.I believe Seagate has significant growth potential. Typically when a company shows growth its P/E ratio rises. If Seagate can show sufficient growth in 2014, to get its P/E ration to 16.8, the share price will have doubled. Typically P/Es between 15 and 20 reflect only moderate growth.I'll use the latest quarter, Seagate's fiscal Q4 2013, to establish a baseline before analyzing future trends. As reported on July 24, June quarter revenue was $3.42 billion, down 3% sequentially from $3.53 billion, and down 24% from $4.48 billion in the year-earlier quarter. All other things being equal, I would argue that a 24% year/year decrease in revenue should correspond to a low P/E ratio. But revenue back in the June quarter of 2012 was up 57% from the June quarter of 2011. It was artificially inflated by the rebound from the disruption of the industry when the drive (and parts) manufacturing plants in Thailand were disrupted for months by flooding.Earnings followed a similar pattern. On a diluted GAAP basis, they were $0.94, down 13% sequentially and down 60% from the June 2012 quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS was $1.20.Guidance for the current, September quarter is revenue between $3.5 and $3.6 billion, which appears to be a sequential increase due to normal seasonality. While data storage is a year-round industry, there is increased demand during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.You can pretty much take away the thesis that SSD replacing HDD will ruin Seagate. In May Seagate launched its first client SSDs and its next generation of enterprise SSDs. While Seagate does not dominate the SSD market, it certainly has the resources to do that over time. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $394 million and investment in R&D was $294 million. The main competitive threat, over time, is likely to be Samsung, which has even vaster financial resources and is one of the manufacturers of the NAND flash memory chips that makes SSDs possible.Whether Seagate, Samsung, Western Digital or a pure SSD play comes to dominate in the long run may depend on who wins in hybrid drives. Hybrid drives offer the low cost-per-bit of data stored on HDD, while offering much of the speed advantage of SSD. In a boot drive scenario, for storing data that is constantly used, like operating systems and application programs, SSD offers advantages that are worth the price. For accessing less used data, say a database, a hybrid can be a better fit.Seagate has advantages (along with WDC) in the hybrid drive market. The SSD, or flash memory, component of a hybrid can be relatively small. For an SSD maker to compete in hybrids would require them to buy HDD components from Seagate, Western Digital, or another supplier, or to go to great expense to set up their own HDD plants. Engineering a small SSD component for a hybrid has not been difficult for Seagate and does not involve any major retooling beyond a new printed circuit board populated with the NAND memory and a hybrid memory controller.Improvements in HDDs are also making them more competitive in an arena where it has been assumed that SSD would dominate. Seagate is now making HDDs just 7mm thick, with 5 mm drives beginning to be shipped this quarter. For tablet computers a 5 mm drive can offer either more storage than an SDD at the same price point, or the same storage at a lesser price point. The 7 mm HDDs are mainly going into thin and light notebook computers. These computers command a premium right now, but they should be coming down in price and increasing in units shipped over the next two years.It is quite possible, when you look at all these moving parts, to conclude that the technology trends will actually favor Seagate as long as it can use its position in the HDD market to dominate hybrids and then the SSD market. The main risks that could dampen the upside are from competition with Western Digital and Samsung, or perhaps one or more of the pure SSD players. Another risk would be if the annual increase in the rate of data storage took a pause.So I see Seagate as having a fairly strong bottom and plenty of upside potential. If things work out along the main probability line I foresee, by the end of 2014 STX should be at $80 per share, but there is a wide margin of error in this model.Disclosure: I am long STX.

1505742,50151,2013-06-17T12:25:27-04:00,,"I have previously briefly covered Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) as a portion of my dividend portfolio for the strong-stomached. STX has had a huge run since the beginning of the year, with an appreciation of 44% YTD, a forward P/E of 7.3, and a dividend yield of 3.2%. It's been a great addition to the portfolio, but there have been several articles written in the last month that more than adequately cover the company's outlook. Instead of beating a dead horse, with this article I am interested in comparing Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate in an effort to identify which company is the better value.YTD Performance (Click to enlarge)(google.com/finance)Both companies have had a great six months with WDC having appreciated a bit more with a 50% return. Both companies are pledging and performing buybacks and dividend payments that match 100% of FCF for the year. This means that WDC is committing 2.4 billion and has a buyback yield of 16% and STX is committing 3.3 billion and has a buyback yield of 21%.(Click to enlarge)PriceSeagate's price to book value has appreciated significantly more over the last three years than Western Digital, which still remains below the average for the S+P 500. This would be more concerning if the increase in price was not supported by increasing earnings over the same time period, but both companies have maintained relatively low P/E ratios as prices have increased.(Click to enlarge)FCF and Fair ValueSeagate has maintained a higher FCF in the last two years and considering that the hard drive market is highly consolidated and pretty stable, both companies should be able to maintain this type of FCF for the near future. Using the analyst estimates for FY 2013 EPS of 5.29 and 8.33 for Seagate and Western Digital respectively and their current P/E ratios of 7 and 8.1, I calculate a fair value of 37.19 and 67.47.(Click to enlarge)ROIC versus DebtLooking at the companies balance sheets, Seagate has a weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC) of 7.6 versus Western Digital's WACC of 4.6. This indicates that Seagate has used more financing in order to grow the business in the past than Western digital has. That being said, Seagate's Return on Invested Capital of 37.2% is much greater than Western Digital's 18.9% indicating that is has maintained a higher return for the capital that is has invested even though it has had to take on some debt to finance it. Both companies have pretty decent balance sheets without a huge amount of debt and have debt/equity ratios of 0.75 for Seagate and 0.21 for Western Digital. Western Digital carries less long term debt while maintaining a reasonable ROIC. Seagate carries more long term debt, but has a higher ROIC and is working on retiring it's higher interest long term debt and has recently completed a tender offer for the 7.75% interest senior notes due in 2018.Concerns about Dwindling PC SalesThere are concerns about dwindling PC sales putting downward pressure on earnings for both of these companies. I think these worries are a bit overblown as demand for data storage continues to increase as more information is stored remotely and video and graphics become increasingly accessed across multiple platforms, not just by desktop PCs. This type of remote storage typically requires multiple backups of all stored data, usually 3 times over and this takes serious storage that can only be provided currently by large hard drives. Solid state drives will increasingly become a legitimate option for tablets and laptops as their capacity increases, but for mass storage of data, there currently is not a better solution than multiple large hard disk drives. In whatever way the industry shifts, it will be a significant hurdle for both companies and they have taken steps to address developing technologies through strategic acquisitions of La Cie and HGST.OverallBetween these two companies, Western Digital represents the better value at current price levels. Typically I would be drawn to Seagate's higher FCF and larger percentage of return of value to shareholders, but the price has appreciated so greatly that until it drops a bit or earnings support further appreciation I will not be purchasing at these levels. Seagate is maintaining a higher ROIC, but has taken on some debt in order to do so and is now working to eliminate it. As they further clean up their balance sheet, they should see more appreciation in the stock price and have more opportunities for strategic acquisitions. Western Digital has not had as significant an increase in P/BV over this time period, has a cleaner balance sheet even though ROIC is a bit lower and still looks to have the earnings to support some additional upside from here. Don't get me wrong, I think both companies will do well in the near future, but as a whole picture, Western Digital is a better value at current price levels.Disclosure: I am long STX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1508192,25258,2013-06-18T11:54:09-04:00,,"As the world becomes ever more connected, the rising demand for data storage continues to grow at a rapid pace. For a traditional hard-disk drive [HDD] manufacturer such as Seagate Technology (STX), the growing transition to cloud storage continues to provide a pressing reason to be bullish on the company. After all, large interconnected networks requires large servers and their redundancies in order to store significant quantities of data.Seagate now trades with a $15.78 billion market capitalization at its present price of $44.01. According to analysts, the company carries a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 8.03 based on earnings estimates of $5.48 in 2014. This trades alongside industry peer and primary competitor Western Digital Corporation (WDC), which carries a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 8.13 at its current share price of $64.65. While the two companies inherently trade in a practical duopoly following the large consolidation of the hard-disk drive industry, one must wonder if these share prices remain fair valuations of the industry's future potential.Indeed, both of these companies appear to be trading somewhat low in light of future growth opportunity. This is especially so considering the long-term outlook being positioned by the primary capital equipment manufacturer that likely supplies both companies. Intevac (IVAC), is the world's leading supplier of magnetic media processing systems. Its primary manufactured system now processes approximately 60% of all the magnetic disk media produced worldwide. In the company's more recent earnings call found here, Intevac's CEO states the following regarding the outlook of disk media:Indirectly, what these thoughts suggest is that the need for data storage is increasing faster than technology's ability to compact it. This in turn translates into the need for more disks and more drives. As a result, when one considers that the solid state drive [SSD] market has continually lagged the HDD market in terms of growing storage capacity, the long-term future of HDD demand is likely to remain high. This bodes well for both Seagate and Western Digital, whose long-term outlook have often been placed into question in light of improving SSD technology.Concerning Seagate, the company continues to provide an enticing long-term opportunity for investors. The following points are taken from the company's fiscal 3Q 2013 earnings call found here:Overall, Seagate now enjoys the benefit of its shared dominance in the HDD space. The company now offers a 3.5% dividend yield with an annual rate of $1.52. This too continues to rise as seen in the chart below.STX data by YChartsSeagate continues to impress as the company returns value to shareholders while subsequently improving its balance sheet. Likewise, the drive to the cloud and the increasing demand for data storage continues to suggest that the industry itself may be undervalued. Above all, with its continued pursuit to reduce the share count, Seagate provides investors with an ongoing reason to stay long the stock. Because of this, investors gain the benefits of a correlated rise in share price, higher earnings, and a reduction in cash outflows from dividend distributions. With such upward pressure at hand, the company continues to remain a convincing long-term stock to hold.Disclosure: I am long STX, IVAC. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1476691,25265,2013-06-03T10:35:25-04:00,,"Since I first profiled Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) in August 2012, the stock has climbed nearly 27 percent, outpacing the increase in the S&P 500 by 10 percent. I have read many bearish sell-side pieces on the hard disk drive (HDD) industry in the past year. They couldn't be more wrong in my opinion. The sell-side analysts like to criticize the gross margins of both Seagate and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), arguing that they are unsustainable. Both companies (Seagate - see slide #41 Western Digital - see slide #11) have stated that they expect their gross margin to remain at or above 27 percent for the foreseeable future. The HDD makers have enjoyed record gross margins since the fall of 2011. Here is a look at how Seagate's top line and gross margins have behaved over the past seven quarters.Source: Quarterly FilingsYou can see the big increase in both numbers beginning in the fall and winter of 2011/2012. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, there were devastating floods in Thailand, where many HDDs and related components are made. Many HDD makers did not have enough supply to meet the demand. Seagate was probably the least affected by the floods, so their sales swelled for a few quarters as the OEMs looked to the company to fill supply gaps. Sales have since leveled out as Western Digital returned to full operations. During that same time period, there was industry consolidation. Seagate purchased Samsung's HDD unit and Western Digital purchased Hitachi's. These two companies now produce approximately 90 percent of the world's HDDs, with Toshiba representing the balance.Most of the sell-side analysts are worried that gross margins will return to the pre-Thai floods, pre-industry consolidation levels, i.e., back to the high teens/low twenties. They couldn't be more wrong in my opinion. What they are failing to realize, is that two companies now control 90 percent of the supply of HDDs; it is essentially a duopoly. A duopoly is a price maker, not a price taker. How easy is it for Seagate and Western Digital to collude without ever actually talking to each other? Extremely easy! If you have ever listened to either company's quarterly earnings calls, you will hear them both talk about a range for gross margins going forward. The bottom number is always 27 percent. Both companies don't want to sell for an average gross margin of less than 27 percent...so why would they ever? Both companies are incentivized to control supply and pricing to make this happen. If they both cooperate, they both win. If one decides to cheat, the cheater will win in the short-term but both will lose in the long-term. This is the classic game theory example of prisoner's dilemma. Anyone that has ever taken an economics course is well aware of this. While I don't see gross margins ticking up much above 27 percent without a real uptick in demand, I don't see either company ""cheating"" and selling below that level either.So as long as the two companies continue to ""collude"" by talking to each other through quarterly earnings calls, I see Seagate maintaining their gross margin at approximately 27 percent, which should allow the company to continue to generate ~$2B in free-cash-flow a year (I'm just extrapolating the past two quarter's results where the gross margin was ~27 percent). About 1/4 of that amount is needed to fund the dividend; the rest can, presumably, be used to buy back stock. The company has stated and reiterated that they intend to have ~250M basic shares outstanding by the end of calendar year 2014. That would be a 28 percent drop from the current level, in just 19 months. If the stock keeps rising at the current rate, that would be a very difficult task to accomplish. But regardless, I still think the share count can get down to at least 300M by that time, which would still be an impressive 14 percent decline in the share count.Another bear argument I hear is that solid-state drives (SSDs) will eventually replace HDDs. Phooey I say! The HDD bears simply do not understand how HDD technology is progressing and how it is eating into the advantages that SSD enjoys. Both Seagate and Western Digital are building fast and sleek 5mm thick hybrid drives (an HDD paired with some flash to speed up common tasks) for the consumer market that can fit into tablets and boost storage capacity to 500GB or more for a price about 1/5th of what a similar sized SSD would cost. Simply put, I do not believe that SSD will displace HDDs anytime soon. ""Big Data"" is here and it is real. Digital storage needs are growing at a spectacular rate. If you listen to what the storage companies like EMC (EMC), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), and HP (NYSE:HPQ) are saying about their customer's needs, you will see that only a very small percentage of the storage needs to be ""hot"" or immediately available. That portion is likely stored on flash drives but the remainder will remain on HDDs for many years to come. It is simply uneconomical to store all data on SSDs. It is also impossible from an industry capacity standpoint. It would take hundreds of billions in capital investments before the SSD industry could produce enough flash to meet even 25 percent of the storage demand that exists today.From a valuation perspective, Seagate is certainly not as cheap as it was last August when I first profiled the stock. I believe that normalized EPS will be in the range of $5.00/share going forward, unless we see a strong uptick in PC sales. That puts the stock at around 8.5x EPS today, which is toward the high-end of the historical range. For a technology hardware company, I would expect the earnings multiple to top out around 12x - any higher and I'd likely be a seller. Of course there is the nice 3.5% dividend yield as well. But if the company buys back even 50M shares by the end of 2014, that multiple will shrink to 7.3x based on the current stock price as EPS would climb to $6/share - assuming they continue to earn the same dollar amount of earnings(~$1.8B). So there is definitely room for further multiple expansion if you are a patient investor.The risk to this thesis is that I am wrong about the margins remaining north of 27 percent. If they drop to the low 20s, the stock will dive with them. I just don't see that happening as long as both Seagate and Western Digital follow ""the rules"" as I have laid them out. So why do I like Seagate more than Western Digital? Their market caps and market share are nearly identical. The main reason I like Seagate more is the allocation of shareholder capital. Whereas Western Digital sits on most of their cash, Seagate returns nearly all its excess cash to shareholders. I like to buy shareholder friendly companies. Seagate is one of the best I have seen in that regard.Disclosure: I am long STX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1462131,24582,2013-05-26T21:08:41-04:00,,"Since recommending Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) on September 7, 2012, shares of the HDD maker are up about 43%. In that piece, I concluded that the stock could double by the end of 2014 to $60, given the scale of the company's share buyback program, exceptionally bearish valuation, and some organic income growth.It's well known that the HDD industry has several strong headwinds. A secular shift towards mobile computing is underway, which overwhelmingly favors solid state drives (SSDs) and flash memory.Additionally, the inflated gross margins that both Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and STX enjoyed as a result of the Thai floods and subsequent supply shortage have largely passed as the market has returned to equilibrium. Without this temporary pricing power, both companies' bottom lines are facing the reality of a rapidly declining PC market and weakened HDD demand in that part of the business.That being said, I think investors are underestimating the potentially transformative impact of a large, positive tail scenario. In this case, HDD demand actually increases over time as a result of data creation from smartphones, tablets, and PCs and the resulting cloud storage needs. Furthermore, STX's investments in SSD and flash also pay off as PCs move towards a hybrid model and the company's products penetrate at least some of the direct mobile memory market.Positive Tail Scenario - 50% UpsideManagement reiterated its guidance for 250 million shares by 2014 in its most recent quarterly conference call, so we'll use that for modeling purposes.The company is also guiding for ""slightly higher"" than $1.8 in annualized FCF -- we'll say $2 billion given a strong anticipated back-end of the year (more on this below).On $2 billion of annualized cash flow and 250 million shares, investors are getting about $8 in free cash flow per share. On that figure, the FCF yield is an outstanding 18.6%, and investors are paying 5.3 times FCF.Modeling for $2 billion in FCF seems reasonable for fiscal 2014; management is expecting supply constraints toward the end of calendar 2013 given the rapid expansion in cloud growth, which overwhelmingly utilizes cheap, bulky HDD drives.ASPs (average selling prices) have been ~$63/unit over the last couple of quarters, a far cry from the $73/unit it was doing during the supply shortage. I believe ASPs will tick upwards as cloud storage capacity needs continue to grow and the STX/WDC duopoly works to keep prices elevated.According to IDC and Seagate's own projections (which we may want to discount a bit), HDD capacity demand is expected to explode over the next few years as both the public and private cloud builds outward:The key catalyst here is data creation stemming from mobile platforms.As I noted in my September recommendation, STX has made several investments in the SSD space to prepare for this secular trend. The company kicked things off by swiping Gary Gentry (the lead SSD guy at Micron (NASDAQ:MU)) to invigorate its SSD line. Its recent SSD rollout is once again receiving great reviews, and pricing appears to be competitive.One of the more interesting bull cases for Seagate is its backing from Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), which generally flies under the radar. When Seagate bought Samsung's HDD business, Samsung took a 9.6% stake in STX, in addition to receiving cash and stock options.Samsung is a main player in the SSD business, why would it want to effectively stay invested in the fate of the HDD business? To me, it looks like a vote of confidence from a player that has a large influence on the future of memory storage.ConclusionsBy the end of 2014, Seagate should be doing at least $2 billion in FCF on 250 million shares, giving investors an FCF yield of more than 18% at current prices. Analyst estimates are calling for $5.48 in FY14 EPS, giving STX a 7.8X forward multiple, well below the 10X historical forward valuation.Short interest recently dropped by a massive 9 million shares to a little over 20 million (6.5% of the float) as the stock broke out above $40. 20 million shares are going to continue to get more difficult to cover as the company buys back more stock. Given the fact that the company needs to buy back more than 100 million shares in the next 18 months to meet its goal, the pressure to cover is going to get more intense. Shorting the stock has a huge negative carry against it as well, given the 3.7% dividend.Multiple normalization (10X forward EPS) would bring shares to about $57, though I think the EPS understates the underlying FCF generation; a much better indication of owner earnings.A share price of $57 implies more than 30% upside, but the FCF yield is unparalleled in today's market and offers exceptional relative value. Add in a 3.7% dividend, and the total yield is greater than 20%.The bear case for the company and industry as a whole is reasonable given the uncertain future dynamics of memory storage. However, the ongoing share buybacks, anticipated supply constraints, dividend and cheap multiple are likely to keep a floor under the stock, while the positive tail sets up a nice risk-reward profile.Disclosure: I am long STX via calls.

1464721,25106,2013-05-28T13:18:27-04:00,,"Over the past year, as shown by the chart below, the world's two largest hard drive makers, Seagate Technolgy (NASDAQ:STX) & Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) have performed well. However, I believe the rally represents a selling opportunity for investors currently long both names and a possible short opportunity for more aggressive investors.STX data by YChartsValuation Not The Main ProblemDespite the massive rally in share price, currently, both STX and WDC trade at single digit PE ratios. In the past, both stocks have traded at higher multiples. However, I believe both STX and WDC are value traps.STX Forward PE Ratio data by YChartsOver the years, due to cheap valuation, both STX and WDC have been talked about as possible private equity buyout targets. Perhaps, when both STX and WDC were trading below 5 times forward earnings, as recently as early 2013, a deal made sense. However, with both STX and WDC trading closer to 10 times forward earnings I believe a buyout is less likely.Chanos Short ThesisNoted investor Jim Chanos has recently turned bearish on the entire industry including STX and WDC in particular. In short, here is the Chanos thesis:As I have previously noted, Jim Chanos is someone worth listening to. That is not to say that I think investors should follow Chanos into every trade. For example, I do not agree with Chanos's view on Dell. However, I do agree with what he is saying about STX and WDC.Insider SellingDespite trading at single digit PE ratios, insiders have been aggressively selling both STX and WDC into the rally. Without question, this is a negative. To me, these large sales suggest that insiders do not believe the future is good for STX and WDC as they are selling at low valuations. In addition to the large number and size of stocks sales in both STX and WDC over the past six months there have been no insider purchases of stock.Einhorn Reduces STX StakeNoted hedge fund investor David Einhorn bought STX shares in 2011 around $16 per share. However, more recently, Einhorn has started selling shares. As I said before, investors should never solely make decisions based on what other ""famous"" investors are doing. That being said, Einhorn's selling should be viewed as a negative.Conclusion & Action PlanFor the reasons discussed above, I am bearish on both STX and WDC. There are a variety of ways for investors to express this thesis:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in STX over the next 72 hours.

1427991,22670,2013-05-12T09:18:20-04:00,,"It was a busy week in Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) land. The stock rose on Monday through Wednesday thanks to the bullish commentary on its Q1 earnings call. That momentum was disrupted on Thursday when Jim Chanos made a short case at the now-famous Ira Sohn Conference. In short, Chanos believes that the demise of the PC market will kill the HDD market.The last time I checked in on Jim Chanos, he was calling GameStop (NYSE:GME) a value trap at $25 a share. That was back in 2011. It has since rallied to nearly $40. It's certainly possible that GME could go out of business in the future, but being long has been the right move for the past 18-months. In other words, be careful who you listen to.Chanos is correct in his belief that HDD demand is suffering alongside the PC market. What he obviously doesn't realize is that storage has been moving to the cloud at a faster pace than it has been moving away from PCs. The reason is not widely known - storage on most PCs doesn't get backed up. In stark contrast, Cloud storage providers have to ensure disaster recovery, failover, around-the-world availability and performance. This requires them to replicate their storage at least three times.This dynamic is just starting to positively impact the market because 1) PC demand has been falling fast and 2) Cloud storage providers buy storage as they need it, whereas consumers buy a lot of storage capacity up front. With the shift from consumer purchasing to Cloud purchasing, the market experienced the equivalent of an inventory digestion period…which is now coming to a close, as exemplified by STX's stellar earnings report.In fact, worldwide demand for storage (as measured in bytes, not drives) has increased by about 40% per year since the dawn of the industry. Last year, that number dipped to just over 10% (because of the aforementioned digestion period), but is now rebounding sharply. If history is any guide, growth will exceed 40% for the next year or two before settling back into the standard 40% range. In other words, HDD-based storage will experience robust demand for several years to come (yes, flash will grow rapidly as well, but could be 10 years away from being big enough to make a meaningful impact on HDD sales).Finally, Chanos expressed his concern about margin pressure in the HDD market. That was a valid concern until STX and WDC acquired the next two largest vendors (Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Hitachi (OTC:HICTF)), who also happened to be the most price-aggressive vendors in the marketplace. Those acquisitions effectively turned the HDD market into a benevolent oligopoly, which may experience anti-competitive investigations before they bow to pricing pressure.Augmenting our argument is the fact that Cloud HDDs carry higher margins than PC HDDs. Also, the industry will run out of manufacturing capacity by year-end. Most means of adding capacity are not particularly cost effective (especially upgrading to new technologies like HAMR), so we can expect supply to tighten and pricing to remain as stable as it has been in some time.Conclusions: HDDs are still king in the storage market…and storage is red hot. Worldwide proliferation of mobile devices and multimedia content (photos, music, movies/videos, etc) will keep this dynamic rolling for the foreseeable future. This explains why STX's CEO reiterated his commitment to the company's massive buyback program last week. These are the top things to remember the next time a bearish pundit growls about PC demand, flash memory, etc.Remember, there is always a flood of data points available in the market - but in almost every case, only two or three really matter. In this case, insatiable storage demand and an oligopolistic competitive environment are reasons why Seagate retains its place in our Stocks To Triple portfolio.Disclosure: I am long STX.

1429971,43401,2013-05-13T11:46:19-04:00,,"All data and information in this article is either from the companies' SEC filings or S&P stock reports.I recently funded some retirement accounts and have since been looking for an investment to park the cash in. Unfortunately, I haven't had much luck finding something that I feel confident will do well at current prices. As Warren Buffett says, an investment opportunity should ""hit you over the head"" and I haven't gotten that feeling lately. So, it was exciting when my screener brought up Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology PCL (NASDAQ:STX). Both companies are leaders in the internal and external electronic storage device industry. Chances are, if you've ever needed some extra storage space for your computer files, music or photos, you've come across them in your search for a good, durable hard drive. Yet, the valuation on these stocks seems shockingly low. WDC is trading at a P/E of ~7, while its P/B is 1.66 and STX, Western Digital's biggest competitor, which is trading at a P/E of ~ 5.5 and a P/B of 5.2. The question is, why are both companies trading at such low multiples and will either one be a good investment for the long-term.Quick ComparisonThe following is a quick comparison of WDC's and STX's pertinent information and ratios. FY 2011 both experienced flooding in their Thailand facilities, which is why they both had weak revenue and earnings in that year.When looking at the financial statements for STX and WDC, one can quickly see a big difference. (Per share data is calculated based on current amount of shares outstanding.)AcquisitionsIn the last few years both WDC and STX had major acquisitions:Future & UncertaintiesWestern Digital and Seagate's main business product are hard drive disks (HDD), which are commonly found in computers, laptops, servers and other traditional computing devices. However, such drives aren't found in tablets, smartphones or other handheld devices, which use solid state drives (SSD).SSDs are smaller, use less power and are less prone to break if dropped. However, they are more expensive to manufacture, although the costs are coming down quickly. On the other hand, HDDs are cheaper to manufacture and, although they use more power and are more prone to breaking due to their moving mechanical parts, they are the storage of choice for cloud computing and high data uses. (See Wikipedia)Both Seagate and WDC feel that hard drive disks are still the best place for their enterprises to be at this time. However, with consumers moving to mobile, WD and Seagate may be caught flat-footed. This is why analysts are giving these companies a ""sell"" rating. They see the need for SSDs growing while the need for HDDs falls. This will cause slower growth and lower profits for both Seagate and WD. It should be noted that both companies have made acquisitions that put them into the SSD market, however, it still remains a relatively small part of both companies.ValuationWhen valuing a company, the hardest part is what Warren Buffett refers to as the ""what-will-they-do-with-the-money"" factor. This is to say that we, as (small) investors, have no say in what management will do with assets and cash they currently have or will earn as time goes by. Yet, it is this factor that is most important when valuing a company. Therefore, we must try to come to a figure that represents the true value of the shares based on what the future holds.It's clear from their financial statements that, Seagate has, in the past, enjoyed better earnings power compared to Western Digital. In this respect, their leverage has served them well. However, as FY 2009 shows, this can be to their detriment in bad times - STX reported a $3 billion dollar loss on $9.8 billion in revenue. WD, on the other hand, reported profits of $454 million on $7.45 billion in revenue in the same year.If analysts are correct on expectations of the future, STX will most likely have a harder time due to its higher leverage. However, I wouldn't be too concerned, in FY 2012 operating earnings were 12.90x interest. Even according to analysts' dire expectations of the future STX should make enough to cover the interest charge with a wide margin.It's doubtful that WDC and STX will have as bad a future as S&P analysts suggest. In fact the ""fair value"" given to WDC by S&P analysts is $69, 18% higher than its current price, even as they give a ""sell"" rating on the stock. This is because they see the stock declining over the next 12 months. However, over the long-term they feel that the stock is worth more than it's currently selling atIt should also be noted that during a WDC conference on Wednesday April 24, 2013, management mentioned:Although I don't know what percentage of STX's revenue came from non-PC related business, I would not be surprised if it was in line with WDC's. However, it is clear that both companies are taking steps to move away from PCs.For the aforementioned reasons, I think it's reasonable to value these companies at an enterprise value of 10 times EBIT. When calculating this figure, it is preferable to use average earnings of, say, the last 5 years. This includes the recession years, which should give us an idea of how to value these shares in an economic downturn, especially STX. We will also base values on EV, which means that 10 times EBIT will equal a hypothetical EV that we would be willing to pay. Based on this EV, we will be able to calculate backwards to what we think the equity of the company is worth. However, since both companies have made major acquisitions that greatly impact their businesses, an average of the last 5 years may not be a great indicator of what the future earnings power of either company may be. Therefore, we will also take FY 2012's earnings and use a multiple of 8. We can then use the average of these two valuations to come to a conclusion about what we think the shares are worth.To do this calculation we will take the hypothetical EV (EBIT x 10) and add back in the excess cash and deduct the value of the companies' debt and be left with an amount that we feel is what the equity is worth. We then divide this by the amount of shares currently outstanding, arriving at the price per share that we would be willing to pay.While the above calculation tells us what the shares of each company are worth at this time, Benjamin Graham warns us that we must always add in a ""margin-of-safety."" As such, investors should only be willing to buy these stocks at prices lower than the amount we calculated above.Therefore, although both stocks are currently priced with low P/E ratios, investors should realize that they are not getting a bargain or as deep a discount as they may think. Although I do think that these stocks will do well over the long-term, they do not seem priced low enough for an investor that is looking for value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1535902,42681,2013-07-05T14:05:52-04:00,,"General informationThe market of the data storage industry is divided into two types of manufacturers: the independent and captive manufacturers. The independent manufacturers are entirely focused on manufacturing hard disk drives (HDDs) and the captive manufacturers like Hitachi (OTC:HICTF), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) are diversified companies with a hard drive division. The most important difference between the two is that captive competitors may sell hard drives at break even profit or even at a loss when it can bundle drives with other more profitable components, such as computer memory. This makes competition especially intense and sometimes irrational for independent manufacturers like Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC).Due to the similarities in market share and business focus, Seagate and Western Digital are chief rivals in the market. The two companies' offerings cover 97% and 90% of the market respectively and both companies produce desktop, mobile, enterprise, and consumer electronics products, and sell mainly to OEMs. Thus, many of the same market forces such as seasonal changes in sales and commoditization of PCs affect the two companies in the same ways.Solid State Devices (SSDs)The position of both these companies is threatened by the new rising competitor of hard drives: The flash memory-based solid state devices. Unlike hard drives, flash memory are solid state, so they contain no moving mechanical parts, use less power, are smaller and less likely to break. These advantages make flash memory very attractive for use in portable devices such as digital music players, cameras and laptops. SSDs still have a few limitations and problems but these limitations are being gradually overcome with technological advances. So although hard drives are still the dominant storage device, SSDs represents an impending threat to Seagate's and Western's business. Following the International Data Corporation (IDC), sales of SSDs will continue to rise every year until 2015.""2011 was a record year for the worldwide SSD market, with revenue more than doubling year over year due to strong SSD shipment growth in the enterprise and client segments,"" said Jeff Janukowicz, research director, Solid State Storage and Hard Disk Drive Components at IDC.The SSD industry revenue was of $5 billion in 2011, a more than double increase (105%) over the $2.4 billion of 2010.It will be very important to see how both data storage companies handle the upcoming of SSDs and integrate it into their business models. This article will focus on their approach on SSD so far.Seagate on SSDSeagate's position in the development of the SSD market up to now has been that of a follower of, investor in, and integrator of 3rd party SSD IP rather than an originator of leading SSD technologies. Seagate's highest rank to date in the top SSD companies list was #11 in Q1 2011.Seagate was a comparatively late entrant to the SSD market launching its first SSDs in December 2009. But Seagate was already corporately aware of SSDs - having launched an unsuccessful lawsuit aimed at STEC (now taken over by Western Digital Corp) the year before.But the main question is: Why didn't Seagate's dominance in the hard drive market translate into an early dominance in SSDs too?Well, Seagate misunderstood the potential size of the SSD market opportunity - and didn't think it was important enough compared to other business opportunities in hard drives.In January 2011, Seagate finally offered to the world a hard hitting rebuttal to the SSD-taking-over-the-world view in an economics focused paper which argued that the reason hard drives would remain the dominant storage technology was because - the company reassured us - it would cost far too much for the SSD market to invest enough resources into replacing hard drives.But this was not true, if users would start to see unbeatable business advantages from SSDs then the necessary investments would be made to support the larger SSD ecosystem.When Seagate did begin to realize that the SSD market wasn't going to go away - the SSD market had already grown too complicated for Seagate to understand what was going on and Seagate was in no position to entertain the idea of becoming a credible technology leader.It's likely that a root cause of Seagate's wrong footedness in SSDs in the 2003 to 2011 years was due to the company's management mistakenly viewing SSDs as just an expensive specialized form of hard drive. Seen from that perspective, hybrid drives and co-existence look like a better solution than they do from a pure SSD perspective.As Seagate didn't develop an adequate SSD IP set of its own - the company's first SSD products relied heavily on 3rd party IP from LSI (NYSE:LSI) and SandForce. However after LSI's acquisition of SandForce in January 2012 it soon became clear that LSI was perfectly capable of getting storage OEM customers such as EMC (EMC) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) on its own. It didn't need Seagate as a route into the SSD market.More recently - 2012 and 2013 - Seagate has therefore been pursuing the only realistic options left to latecomers in the SSD market - acquisition, licensing 3rd party IP and badge engineering.These recent steps are positive moves - either of which - if followed through - could improve Seagate's position within the SSD world.Only recently (May 2013) Seagate really ""impressed"" the SSD market by selling 'The Seagate 600 SSD' and 'The Seagate 600 SSD Pro'. The Seagate 600 SSD is the company's first mainstream 2.5-inch SSD. It has capacities up to 480GB and some versions are just 5mm thick, which means they are perfect for ultrabooks. Prices differ from $109.99 to $454.99 depending on the retailer, capacity and thickness you choose.Western Digital Corporation on SSDWDC on the other hand, also is a late entrant of the market and has recently decided to buy sTec Inc. (NASDAQ:STEC) for $340 million in cash as it also wants to expand its presence in the enterprise solid-state drive market. WDC's CEO said that solid state storage will continue to play an increasingly strategic role in the future of WDC and that this acquisition is again one more building block in his strategy to capitalize on the dramatic changes within the storage industry by investing in SSDs and other high-growth storage products.WDC started its SSD strategy in 2009 by the acquisition of SiliconSystems and really became significant with the 2011 acquisition of Hitachi GST, giving WDC market dominance in SAS SSDs. sTec brings WDC further enterprise SSD strength from its solid design capabilities and a high-performance product portfolio to boost WDC presence in the enterprise SSD market. The sTec acquisition will solidify WDC's position in SSDs while potentially giving Hitachi GST more control over its SSD architecture.Conclusion on SSDsSSD is a very competitive and complex set of markets. Even pure SSD companies [like Sandisk (SNDK), Micron (MU) and Fusion-io (FIO)] - which don't have other distractions - have a tough enough time understanding what's the right way to go with products and markets. Even though Seagate and Western Digital Corp.haven't done a lot of effort, they still haven't convinced me that they take SSDs as seriously as they should.Looking ahead at the challenges and opportunities posed by the SSD market for Seagate and Western Digital Corp.- I think that having to share management time and investment resources between the mutually different interests of solid state and magnetic drive product lines will lead to tensions and conflicts for resources in which the corporate ""compromise solutions"" aren't always going to be the same as the best of class solutions which the SSD market expects.The acquisition of sTec is good news for WDC's shareholders as this acquisition was a necessary and logical step in the right direction. For the first quarter of 2013, Seagate and Western stood respectively 15th and 22th on the ""Top SSD companies"" list. Which made very clear that Western was still lagging behind in the SSD market and had to do something to make the gap a little closer.Both companies should realize that in the modern era of SSDs - the only thing which can beat an SSD in the market - is another - better SSD. In that context - knowing how to design and build the best or cheapest hard drives - and having routes to market for hard drives is - frankly - irrelevant.General conclusionEven though Seagate is (currently) better positioned in the HDD and SSD market, has a higher dividend yield and is more profitable than Western Digital Corp., I'd buy nor Seagate nor Western Digital Corp. today. Both stocks have gone up too much on a year to date basis (WDC went +104% and STX +79%) and I feel that investors are too optimistic about the things these companies have done to prepare themselves for the SSD threat. Further acquisitions and efforts are needed to ensure their position in the market and to ensure long-term EPS growth for shareholders in the future. I have a strong feeling Western Digital Corp.will benefit a lot from its acquisition of sTec (which was standing third in the list of the ""Top SSD companies"") and I'm curious whether or not Seagate will react actively or passively. For now I just feel that it is too early to make an investment decision yet.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1427821,21151,2013-05-12T06:20:59-04:00,,"I bought Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) back in June 2012 while the stock was trading around $23. At that time, it was clear to me that STX was a great bargain. The company was showing many positive aspects:#1 An aggressive dividend increase strategy paired with a low payout ratio.#2 A Massive repurchase program ($2.5B) fueled by a low price earnings ratio.#3 The stock had dropped severely after its dividend cut in 2009 and had clearly solved its problem three years later.For two years in a row, I selected STX to be part of the best dividend stocks for the year. I was very enthusiastic when I bought the stock and had clearly made the right choice back then. But after looking at their latest financial results from May 1st, I'm starting to wonder if it's not time to cash out my profits and run. If I wasn't sitting on a comfortable paper profit, I don't think I would buy more shares right now.Is STX the Perfect Value Trap?I read similar comments around the web saying Seagate Technology was the perfect value trap: low P/E ratio, good dividend yield and cash to back it up. While several dividend stocks are trading with P/E ratios over 15, STX is still under the bar of 7. This sounds like the perfect bargain. Think twice: the problem is that sales might not keep up.After a surge in sales during 2012, we now see the first sign of weakness with this first quarter (see chart).The above chart is not too bad as the sales could bounce back the next quarter. What worries me is the Year-on-Year sales growth trend:Seagate not only saw its sales head downhill as the PC business is slowing, it is giving away market share as well. Management estimates its hard drive share will drop 2% to 41% compared to an increase in share for Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). Most importantly, STX revenues dropped by 21% during the last quarter while WDC surged by 24%.Seagate is in the smallest oligopoly possible sharing 85% of the market with Western Digital. It makes the hard drive industry margin relatively safe but it also makes your only opponent highly dangerous in a case where it develops a better product than yours (just think of what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) did to BlackBerry (BBRY)).In other words, Seagate Technology sales are weakening not only because its main market (HDD) is slowing down, but it also slowly being devoured by a competitor. What happens when you are evolving in a mature market that could eventually fade away and your competitors are clearly hitting your sales? You are most likely to cut on expenses to keep your company afloat. Guess what, STX has already started to cut expenses.Such practices will cleverly hide Seagate Technology's major problems and will provide cash flow temporarily and leave it with sufficient earnings to keep the dividend at a high level. But the sales won't increase and the reduction of expenses might lead to lesser R&D improvements. In technology, this is something you can't afford to let happen.The P/E ratio will most likely stay lower and the stock will keep attracting new investors thinking it's an undervalued stock. As a bonus, they will promote so-called healthy dividend payouts to wait until the stock surges. As I said, that's the perfect value trap.What's the Future?Many investors worry about the eventual death of hard drives. Many customers are switching to mobile devices and even Thorsten Heins, CEO of BlackBerry , claims the death of tablets. This means the future might lie in a super powered smartphone that includes all possible applications and the ability to be connected to a larger screen for work. Therefore, the need for both PCs and tablets would be close to none.Seagate Technology is well aware of this potentially apocalyptic scenario for its company. This is why it has concentrated its effort on mobile storage systems and cloud computing. While some people think cloud computing will put the final nail in the STX coffin, I think it can be their best hope to survive.STX's experience in storage is impressive. They have been around forever in this industry and their capacity to build reliable and effective storage is definitely a core factor in their business model. Companies will always need a way to securely store their information regardless if they are going mobile, cloud or if they keep their old PCs.Recent sales in cloud computing services have been a point of encouragement for Seagate as its sees its business slowly shifting from hard drives to a new business model. STX is developing hybrid SSHD to compete with the high cost of SSDs which are more efficient but too pricey. It's a good idea, but Western Digital started before them. The company is also introducing more powerful storage solutions with their Seagate HAMR that has the largest storage capacity by miles compared to classic HDDs. Here again, WDC has its own product to compete (HGST helium-filled technology). The future will tell us which technology is the best advancement for the storage industry.The eternal fight for STX will be decided by its capacity to innovate with more powerful storage solutions in the cloud business. So far, it has showed its creative power and the company seems to be on the right track… as long as the technology advancements reveal to be as promising as we thought.Final Call on STX: Bullish or Bearish?Considering the current value of the stock and its past appreciation, I'm holding on to my shares of STX for the moment. I think there is an interesting bet to take that Seagate can evolve its business model according to the storage industry's future. The key question is if the company will be able to move fast enough to follow the technology trend? According to my dividend growth model, STX still qualifies as a buy. When I look at the past 5 years of data, it is showing me a strong history. It's only a matter of knowing if this story will continue further.A year ago, buying STX was a no brainer. Today, I would definitely be more careful if I had missed the train. I would definitely wait for a pull back when I will sell my shares and you can buy them!Disclosure: I am long STX.

1430051,21848,2013-05-13T12:04:36-04:00,,"At the Ira Sohn conference on Wednesday, Jim Chanos gave a presentation on being short Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). Chanos has been negative on the entire PC industry citing that the explosion in smartphones and tablets are eroding PC sales.In June 2012, he called HP (NYSE:HPQ) the ultimate value trap as it meets all five points of the characteristics for a value stock.Regarding PC's, he presents that PC sales numbers peaked in 2012 and has reversed into a decline in sales from the first quarter of 2013.Here is a summarized version of his short thesis on Seagate and then I'll get into some numbers to poke and see whether there are any signs of a failing industry.A Dangerous Short?Although Seagate is hitting new highs, check out these numbers taken from the Old School Value valuation and analysis spreadsheets.I have learned not to short, or claim a company is overpriced, based on stock price alone. The same thing applies to Seagate when looking at these numbers. You wouldn't know that judged on the latest figures that Seagate is at all time highs. Even at these levels, these ratios are within value stock ranges.Since Chanos is not claiming Seagate is a good short because it is overpriced, but rather that business is bound to fail due to a fall in margins and drops in sales, let's analyze those two areas.Analyzing the MarginsThe easiest thing to do is to draw a simple graph depicting the gross, operating and net margins.Let's just say for the sake of giving Seagate the benefit of the doubt, that the recession in 2009 is an anomaly. If this is the case, the operating income of Seagate from 2003-2008 was averaging 9.2%. In the last three years and TTM, it has jumped to 15.6% and Chanos' question comes into mind.Are the prices of hard drives sustainable?Seagate now offers SSD which comes at a higher price point, but it is bound to come down further in price. There is competition from digital storage which offers the convenience of accessibility from anywhere.Physical storage is a commodity business with no moat so I find it difficult to believe that prices can stay high enough to maintain the current margins.Does the DuPont Analysis Show Anything?Taking it one step further, does the DuPont analysis point to any signs that the growth and increase in business performance is coming from anything other than improvements in margins?See the 3 step and 5 step DuPont analysis below.Looking over the golden years, the increases in ROE were due to:From a business and operational perspective, Seagate is on fire. They are doing everything right.So far, Chanos certainly isn't shorting Seagate based on fundamental deterioration. He is taking a top down approach by believing that the downfall of the PC industry will cascade into the hard drive space.Inventory Analysis and InterpretationSince the ROE didn't show anything strange, let's take a look at Chanos' angle of sales set up to fall.One of the leading indicators of sales is inventory and the way to check that is to analyze the details of the inventory to predict whether the company is expecting a boom or bust in sales.Inventory is made up of raw materials, works in progress, purchased components, and finished goods.If you take a look at the area I highlighted, the latest quarter is showing a disturbing difference compared to the same period dating back 10 years.The last time there was such a drop in works in progress was back in 2004. Seagate was making more products even during the recession. Is this what Chanos was talking about?Now that finished goods for the latest quarter is up 94% compared to one year ago, the next few quarters will be a telling sign depending on whether the inventory sells.Here is another look by reviewing the quarters sequentially.The way the inventory line items integrate with each other is like this:Additional interpretations to know:Applying this interpretation to Seagate, the line that draws my eye is works in progress. Compare it to the previous periods and there are big differences.When it comes to inventory for Seagate, Chanos may be onto something, but there is nothing concrete at the moment.Accounting Manipulation ChecksRunning a quick earnings manipulation check via the Beneish M score, the score comes out to be a solid -3.03.While the Beneish score or models can never replace a thorough and manual investigation, a cursory look reveals that Seagate doesn't have any earnings manipulation factors to worry about.If you are adventurous, here is a list of 52 techniques you can perform to detect financial manipulation.Is Chanos Right or Wrong?It is too early to tell.Because it seems like he is shorting based on a top down approach, we'll see whether his thesis plays out. I'm just not in the game of predicting industry trends.If Seagate was showing fundamental flaws and a breakdown in fundamentals, then it could be come a compelling case, but Seagate does not fit into a value trap mold or one to short at this time unless you have deep pockets and can ride out margin calls."
1418781,31461,2013-05-09T11:28:00-04:00,,"Last week Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) reported its fiscal Q3 financial results. Seagate's revenue of $3.53 billion and EPS of $1.26 topped analysts' estimates. Profits slipped by a whopping 64% year-on-year while revenues were down by 20% on an annual basis. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Aaron Rakers calculates enterprise drive shipments were 15.9 million in the first calendar 2013 quarter -- a 7% rise sequentially. He says such shipments were:Q1 2013 - 15.9 million  Q4 2012 - 15.0 million  Q3 2012 - 13.2 million  Q2 2012 - 17.8 millionWhile nobody expects Seagate's TAM (total addressable market) to improve significantly amid an overall weak PC market in the near-term, as projected by IDC and Gartner, Seagate's pricing and margins are expected to remain firm going forward. The industry has been successfully maintaining a stable pricing environment by curtailing production as and when needed.Seagate has developed a new technology, known as HAMR, which will have far-reaching implications for its stock. In this article I'll delve deeper into this technology, and analyze its potential impact on Seagate's stock.Seagate Optimistic About Areal Density GrowthSeagate believes the next few years the storage industry will present the company new and significant opportunities, Seagate management said in a conference call post earnings.For the first nine months of the current fiscal year, Seagate has shipped over 130 exabytes of storage, reflecting 33% year-over-year growth, which is well above the current areal density growth rate. For calendar 2013, Seagate believes the storage industry is on pace to ship 500 exabytes of storage, and is advancing at a rate which is more than twice greater than expected areal density growth rate.Seagate increased capital investment in new storage technologies to support a broader product portfolio of storage devices, including hybrid, solid-state drives and other devices and services, which Seagate believes, will be critical to follow the mobile compute environment.Seagate introduced some innovative products this year that have been well-received by leading OEMs including 7 mm, 500 GB ultra mobile devices and 2 TB desktop hybrid products.Seagate's HAMR Technology: A Game Changer in Areal DensityAreal density refers to the amount of data per square inch that can be packed onto a storage medium. Fang Zhang, an analyst for storage systems at HIS, said:The current perpendicular magnetic recording or PMR technology used in mechanical hard drives will soon become obsolete, because it's impossible with PMR to reduce the size of the magnetized bits any further as it renders them unstable due to a phenomenon known as superparamagnetism. Meanwhile, shingled magnetic recording (SMR) will act as a temporary boost in HDD capacity and Seagate will start shipping SMR-based disk drives later this year.But the problem with SMR drives is that they cause delay to rewrite data as tracks overlapped by the new data track need to be reconstructed before writing new data. Although the overlapping of data tracks helps store more data, it's hardly encouraging to buy a disk drive that writes data more slowly.Seagate has a long-term solution that uses a more stable medium. The company said it will introduce a 4-platter drive based on Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology as early as next year that's capable of storing up to 6.4 TB of data. HAMR, combined with self-ordered magnetic arrays of iron-platinum particles, solves the superparamagnetism problem by heating the medium with a laser-generated beam at the precise spot where data bits are being written. With heat, the medium becomes writable, and the rapid subsequent cooling stabilizes the written data. Seagate said it has spent nearly 10 years to develop the progressive HAMR technology that will eventually lead to a 60TB 3.5-inch drive.HGST's Helium-Filled Technology: A Threat to Seagate's HAMR?Seagate has spent billions of dollars in the development and implementation of HAMR technology. Meanwhile, rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) owned Hitachi GST has approached the superparamagnetism problem with a different solution.It has filled a drive with low friction helium gas, the density of which is one-seventh that of air. Helium helps adding more platters in a standard drive enclosure. Seven platters can be added instead of four in today's 4TB, 3.5-inch form factor drive, which will make it a 7TB drive.With helium it's possible to place data tracks closer that will allow scaling in data density only up to a certain extent. Investors should note that with pumping helium HGST only upgrades the existing PMR technology and increases capacity by up to 75%. It's not a new technology that has the potential to deliver a 60TB 3.5-inch drive in future, something that's possible with HAMR.HGST has been researching to develop a standalone technology though, known as bit-patterned media, to replace PMR. But bit-patterned media isn't a possibility right now since billions of dollars are needed for its commercialization. However, this technology will go mainstream when HAMR runs out of steam. Experts believe that won't happen before 2020.HGST is not the only company that researched helium filling in a standard drive enclosure. Seagate started to consider the sealed drive technology earlier than its competitors and has 80 patents in the area. Jon Piazza, senior manager of corporate communications at Seagate, said in a conversation with X-bit labs:For Seagate investors this is great news, because HAMR is going to be the most happening technological advancement in the storage industry. With the boom in datacenters, HAMR will solve the problem of mass storage. SSDs have their capacity limitations and they're not suitable for datacenters per se. Over the years, Seagate has achieved numerous technology breakthroughs and HAMR has the potential to become a real game changer as far as mass storage is concerned.Gartner Says SSDs will not Replace HDDs in DatacentersWith the enormity of datacenter storage capacity requirements, it's impossible that HDDs will be completely replaced with SSDs in the foreseeable future, according to a new research report by Gartner. You can access the report here, which has been reposted in its entirety by StorageNewsletter.com. The report says:Brendan Collins, vice president of product management at HGST, suggested that he agreed with Gartner's findings.Seagate Introduces SSHDAlthough SSDs aren't replacing hard drives anytime soon, particularly in datacenters, there's undoubtedly tremendous growth opportunity for SSDs not only in the consumer segment, but in part in the enterprise segment as well. For SSDs, Seagate is now following Western Digital's strategy, which relies on making hybrid hard drives that incorporate a significant amount of flash memory, but retain a hard drive's larger capacity. Seagate introduces the third generation of its hybrids based on new hybrid solid state technology, known as SSHD. Western Digital pioneered the technology when they launched the first storage device based on SSHD at the CES this year.For the first time Seagate is now dropping the Momentus brand name from its hybrid drives. The new hybrids will be introduced as a ""Laptop SSHD,"" ""Desktop SSHD,"" or ""Laptop Thin SSHD,"" with different chassis sizes. Seagate thinks these new drives will entice new buyers. Although an SSHD is not as fast as a pure flash drive, it's much faster than a traditional HDD. A standard SSD is approximately 40% faster than a normal HDD, whereas a standard hybrid SSHD is only 10% slower than a normal SSD.With the Virident deal announced recently, Seagate said it will continue to provide a portfolio of enterprise products for the cloud environment including hard drives, SSDs, hybrid drives and a complete line of flash-based PCI solutions.Competition: Seagate vs. Western DigitalNeedham & Co.'s Richard Kugele raised Seagate to Buy from Hold, and set a $45 short-term price target. As far as competition from nearest rival Western Digital is concerned, Kugele said:STX Return on Invested Capital data by YChartsSeagate's ROIC is more than double than that of Western Digital. Seagate is currently trading at a P/E multiple of 6.8, compared to Western Digital's 7.5, which is indicative of Seagate's more attractive valuation.A P/E Expansion is Certainly in the CardsDespite Seagate's revenue per share and earnings per share have been increasing steadily since 2009, Seagate is trading cheaply in terms of P/E multiple. Why? Wall Street feels with fierce price competition the disk-drive industry will return to bad old days. Seagate's share price is seemingly discounting a fear of a profit collapse.STX Revenue Per Share TTM data by YChartsBut that's nothing more than a myth. With consolidation there are only three companies in the disk-drive industry right now, down from five a year ago after Seagate bought Samsung's disk-drive operations and Western Digital acquired Hitachi GST. Apart from these two, Toshiba is the only other independent disk-drive producer.After consolidation the disk-drive industry has transformed into a microeconomic model known as collusive oligopoly. In a collusive oligopoly, companies seek to avoid uncertainties regarding pricing and output by entering into collusive agreements. Investors need to understand that with HAMR Seagate has an enormous advantage here. It's a strong possibility right now that Seagate will emerge as a price leader to dominate the rest of the industry by its own terms.This clearly indicates that there is a substantive mispricing in Seagate's stock as the Street is not fully aware of Seagate's potential. A more favorable and stable pricing in the industry coupled with increasing enterprise demand driven by datacenters will finally change the outlook regarding Seagate's stock. I strongly believe Seagate's stock deserves a P/E multiple well above 10, and it's now only a matter of time the mispricing will be corrected.Moreover, with Seagate continuing to repurchase stock and boosting dividend, investors will become greedy to own the stock. As a result, P/E will expand naturally. I've tried to estimate Seagate's future stock price in the table presented below. For 2013 and 2014, the expected EPS data is taken from Bloomberg Businessweek. Following Gartner's prediction that enterprise storage will exceed 500,000 petabytes in 2017, I've assumed a 15% increase in earnings since 2015, one year after Seagate launches HAMR-based hard drives.ConclusionSeagate's CEO Steve Luczo has talked about a scarcity of storage capacity in the coming years. This will support double-digit annual growth in HDD production. Seagate's stock has seen a mild rally in the past few months, which I believe is the beginning of a secular uptrend. I would recommend buying the stock on dips.Disclosure: I am long STX, WDC. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1395471,45851,2013-05-02T15:50:42-04:00,,"To say that Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) has had a good run this year would be an understatement. Its stock is up by 19.7% in 2013, besting the return on the S&P 500 by 8.7% in the same span. It has also risen by 52% since the middle of 2012, more than trebling the gains of the S&P500 in the same period.More pertinently, Seagate leads most of its direct competitors in the same period:Table: Select Storage Stock MeasuresSource: Bloomberg, WSJAs may be seen from the table above, Seagate has posted incredible stock performance despite having negative forward earnings growth. Indeed, while Seagate delivered fiscal third-quarter earnings of $1.26 per share against analysts earnings estimate of $1.15 per share, it is less than half of the $2.64 per share it earned in the same period a year earlier.For its fiscal year ending in June 2013, Seagate is expected to register earnings of $5.21 per share - 23% lower than the $6.75 it earned a year earlier. It doesn't get much better over the next five years, with the company forecasting to see its earnings contract by 7% on an annual basis over that span.By most conventional measures, Seagate shouldn't be performing as well as it has - but there's the rub: the story of Seagate is the story of a market that is being transformed by changes in the way that businesses and consumers are utilizing storage and storage devices. In that sense, the key to understanding the stock is context.Indeed, looking at Seagate using a non-conventional five-year forward P/E, it turns out that it would be the second-cheapest stock among itself and its major competitors, even accounting for its putative earnings growth contraction.Moreover, as is typical with forecasts, later years' numbers are more likely to be inaccurate as there is simply no way to correctly anticipate changes in consumer demand or technological innovation over that span. In fact, most analysts revise their forecasts four times a year to coincide with the typical earnings reporting cycle. Regardless, Seagate is anticipated to see its earnings rise by 5.2% in fiscal 2014 (half of which will be recognized in calendar 2013) so near-term earnings growth is generally expected to be positive.Seagate: The Post-PC EraSeagate is well-known as a maker of storage devices for computers. One merely has to visit Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) or any other popular electronics chain to see boxes and boxes of Seagate hard drives of various capacities and speeds on sale. As a consequence, the conventional analysis of Seagate will focus on typical storage solutions and sales growth of those units in relation to the number of PCs sold.However, as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder Steve Jobs was famous for popularizing, we now live in the Post-PC era and the data has been confirming his assertion. However, even as personal computer shipments registered their sharpest fall ever, smartphones continue to go from strength-to-strength, with shipments rising by 36% in the first quarter.Meanwhile, the fastest-growing segment of the mobile device space, tablets, is expected to exceed PC sales for the first time in 2013. In that sense, any company still focused entirely on leveraging itself in the old desktop PC paradigm is likely to suffer.Seagate is not such a company: indeed, the story of Seagate is a combination of its shift into the mobility space of its storage devices and providing high-speed data access to enterprise.The new paradigm is different in that mobile devices require smaller form factors and, because user-experience is important in retaining customers, device manufacturers such as Apple, HTC, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), and one of our favorites Nokia (NYSE:NOK), are focusing more keenly on performance - even for their cheaper offerings.Seagate has adapted to this new paradigm by offering smaller and faster form factor devices such as its Momentus XT line of hybrid-SSD drives that combine the storage capacity of a mechanical drive with a smaller array of solid-state memory chips that enable faster performance through dynamic caching technology. This allows Seagate drives to be shipped with much thinner devices such as Ultrabooks or Tablet Hybrids, which is important since such devices are expected to be the saving grace of a flailing market.However, where Seagate is really expected to shine is in the enterprise space.The post-PC era is already seeing a subtle shift in the way devices are used: with the broad availability of faster data connections such as LTE, mobile devices are being used less as portable media libraries and more as portals to cloud services. After all, why should consumers limit themselves to the capacity of their smartphones - typical only 5% that of the average PC hard drive - when they can access more of their data online through the cloud?Moreover, as businesses deploy more mobile devices to employees and provide mobile access to enterprise-level applications such ERP systems via smart devices, the demand for high-performance server storage will increase.This, in turn, shifts the onus of providing fast data access from device manufacturers onto the providers of cloud services, which have seen high levels of adoption in the past year, based on app utilization. In short, while the ultimate end user of all that fast data access is retail, the customers are the enterprise market that provide the backbone for these services.Indeed, Enterprise SSD demand is predicted to rise by more than 10-fold in the five years ending in 2016 - for a 59% CAGR. However, the rise in SSD demand for enterprise, while remarkable, is anticipated to grow at a slower pace than the abandonment rate of mechanical HDD, hence a more muted earnings growth curve for Seagate and its competitor, WD, which has been witnessing strong growth in this space.In effect, a bet on Seagate isn't so much a bet on near-term earnings prospects but a bet on the evolution of the storage market, which is in the early stages of evolving as a result of a paradigm shift in usage scenarios. In our view, the earnings contraction being witnessed this year is simply a result of Seagate adapting to the new environment - something that its peers will also have to do sooner or later.Seagate: Solid FundamentalsWe would not be comfortable recommending Seagate if we did not think it could sustain itself in an evolving market environment. The good news? It is.As we've already mentioned, the stock is cheap relative to its peers even with tepid growth rates as it evolves its product offerings. As we've asserted, other companies in this space, such as EMC and SanDisk (SNDK), are likely to transition themselves in order to adapt to the new paradigm - meaning that their forward earnings are also likely to come under pressure and fall in line with those of Seagate and Western Digital (NYSE:WD). Consequently, we believe that the valuation gap will widen - Seagate will become cheaper, especially if, as we believe, its earnings beat expectations down the line.Seagate is also cheap on important metrics such as price-to-free cash flow - at just 4x FCF, it is trading at one-fourth the valuation of its industry peers. Together with strong cash fundamentals (both its quick and current ratios are better than the industry and/or the S&P 500), we are confident that Seagate can continue to finance its transition years. This is confirmed by the fact that while its margins are lower than industry average at 37% to its industry's 50%, its returns on investment and assets at 56% and 37%, respectively, are far higher than its industry's 9% and 8.2%. Seagate management is simply more adept at extracting value than its competitors.Finally, Seagate also has a generous dividend yield of 4.4% -- nearly quintuple its industry's 0.9% and more than double the S&P 500's 2.1%.ConclusionSeagate is worth every penny of its 4.7x multiple and while it's just $1.54 off of its 52-week high, it could add another 10 to 15% in the next three months, especially after exceeding earnings estimates.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in STX over the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Black Coral Research, Inc. is a team of writers who provide unique perspective to help inspire investors.

1407081,23479,2013-05-06T18:11:52-04:00,,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) announced its Q3 FY 2013 earnings on May 1, where it reported total revenues of $3.5 billion, a 21% year-over-year (y-o-y) decline. However, the decline was less than the market consensus. Revenues declined mainly due to lower shipments as well as average selling price. The storage company shipped total over 55 million  units during, down from nearly 60 million it shipped in the same period a  year ago. While the company experienced significant weakness in the PC and notebook market in  Q3, all  other divisions showed yearly growth  driven by storage demand from cloud computing and growth in  digital  content.However, what came to rescue for the storage company was a better product mix and improvements in high-end enterprise and consumer storage devices. This resulted into less than expected decline in ASP, helping the storage company in beating market expectations. Average selling price per hard  drive was over $63 in the  quarter, down from $73 a  year ago, but in line with Q2′s ASP. While gross margin declined to below 27% from around 37% a year ago, it was less than the percentage decline in ASP due to better mix  of products and cost improvements.Seagate generated over $450  million in free cash flow even as it spent nearly $300 million and $220  million towards products development and capital expenditures, respectively. Overall cash and cash equivalents increased to $1.4 billion despite the fact that company returned 75% of its operating cash flow to shareholders and retired part of its debt early. The storage  company expects Q4 FY 2013 revenues in the range of $3.3 billion to  $3.45  billion due to a flat-to-slightly down total available market,  coupled with a seasonal change in the business mix.We are updating our price estimate of Seagate, to reflect earnings and recent trends. Below we take a look at major growth drivers for the company. PC Sales To Pick Up, Seagate Readying Itself To Tap The Growing SSD DemandWhile PC sales have been declining due to consumer softness in  mature markets     (the U.S. and Western Europe), slowing demand from  emerging markets  and    IT spending cuts amidst weak macroeconomic  environment, the trend is expected to reverse in the next half of 2013. Enterprises and retail users are expected to upgrade their desktops as the economy improves. Further, users who have been pushing their purchases due to weak consumer sentiment across the globe should be back to the market. However, this could come with a higher adoption of   solid state drives. Currently, SSDs   are at least twice as   expensive as regular HDDs and  this cost   differential is still causing   price-conscious customers  and enterprises   to prefer HDDs. However,  going forward SSD production costs are likely to go down   significantly  due to an improvement in   technology. This should boost demand of SSDs as  the cost advantage of HDDs will be diminished.The other major reason for decline in PC sales was cannibalization from tablets. We  estimate that tablet sales will  outstrip  notebook   and  netbook  sales  by the end of our forecast  period. All  tablet computers  use  solid state  memory chips as their  primary    storage memory since HDD   memory generally is comparatively unresponsive and  bulky.While Seagate was a little slow to adapt to changing trend  in   favor to the SSD space, it  has been increasing its focus on SSD business to tap the   growing  demand. Last year, Seagate made investments in companies such  as  LaCie  and DensBits to acquire expertise in the SSD and USB flash  storage   market. Seagate and DensBits are working on building  “low-cost,   high-performance” consumer SSDs.Further, LaCie has given Seagate access to an    established consumer brand known for innovative designs. Further, according to recent earnings, approximately 4% of Seagate’s revenue is being spent towards maintenance of existing  operations to support a broader product portfolio mainly hybrid and solid-state drives. Around 2% of revenue is going towards improving global  R&D.With the aforementioned acquisitions, its relationships  with   industry-leading original equipment manufacturers  (OEMs), sales  clout,   and production facilities should help, Seagate could outperform the  overall SSD   market growth and see its SSD market share increase going    forward.Soaring Storage Requirement Presents Opportunities Storage requirements are going up as evidenced by the fact   that Seagate  shipped over 47 exabytes of storage in Q3 with each disk   averaging  approximately 842 gigabytes. This is a 15% and 25% y-o-y  growth in exabyte and average capacity per drive, respectively. This  growth is being driven by increasing use of high  definition   content for  media  consumption and rich   formats such  as HD DVD and  Blu-Ray.Further, the high growth rate of digital content is driving the need for  high    capacity storage to aggregate, host, distribute, manage, back up  and use    digital content. Tablet and  smartphone users also  consume more  digital  content  like  online video   streaming, email and   music. While many of these  mobile devices are increasingly  becoming dependent  on network   attached     storage, tablets with  USB ports are also looking at  external  drives for   additional  storage  capacity. Seagate, being one  of the market leaders in hard disk drive (HDD) market, will continue to  benefit from this surge in storage demand.In addition, remote storage is becoming a standard for most    enterprises and has    even gained traction with retail customers for  services like iCloud,    Dropbox, Skydrive and Google Drive. An  increasing number of businesses  are deploying   cloud computing  environments in an effort to   pool  resources    and   cut costs. The     traditional enterprise and client compute markets will continue to     demand high capacity storage solutions.Disclosure: No positions."

Because the two of them combined now control over 90% of the disk drive market, this strategy eliminates one important source of risk.STX and WDC are similar in many ways: they each have a fiscal year which ends at the end of June, they each have recently acquired a large competitor (STX acquired Samsung's operations in late 2011; WDC acquired Hitachi's operations in March 2012) , they each have strong balance sheets, and they each are trading at very low multiples to earnings and cash flow. The table below provides Monday's closing price, current dividend yield, net balance sheet cash per share, trailing twelve months earnings per share and price earnings ratio (based on trailing twelve months earnings). Stock prices and current yields are derived from Yahoo Financial; earnings and balance sheet information is derived from each company's filings with the SEC.As you can see, each of these companies is throwing off a lot of cash, and the cash output has continued nicely into fiscal 2013. The two companies have followed different strategies in deploying the cash which continues to gush over the transom each month. STX has emphasized share repurchases while WDC has built up balance sheet cash. WDC management has committed to devoting 50% of cash flow to a combination of dividends and share repurchases going forward so that more repurchases are likely to materialize.For each company, fiscal 2013 started last July and, as of the financial statements released for the quarter ending December 2012, we were halfway through the fiscal year. The table below provides the dollar amount of share repurchases and the percentage reduction in share count over the first 6 months of fiscal 2013 based on each company's SEC filings and share count information on each company's website.STX was much more aggressive on the repurchase front and reduced its share count considerably in a short period of time. WDC was more conservative and has built up balance sheet cash, which, as noted above, is likely to be targeted at repurchases going forward.Although many investors are lukewarm toward share repurchases and - at the same time - are enthusiastic about dividend increases, it is important to understand the relationship between the two. Share repurchases reduce share count, and thereby make future dividend increases less expensive. Buying shares back when a company's stock is trading at a cheap price is a great way to set the stage for generous dividend increases in the future.The coming quarterly reports of each company should be interesting. STX paid extra dividends in December in anticipation of the tax law change and skipped first quarter dividends (which were essentially prepaid in December). That means that STX likely had extra cash in the most recent quarter; it will be interesting to see how it was deployed.The next few quarters will tell us a lot about WDC and STX. The quarter ending March 31, 2013, will be the first quarter in which we will be able to see a meaningful year over year comparison of STX, including the Samsung acquisition. For WDC, we will have to wait until the quarter ending June 30, 2013, for similar year over year comparison of WDC including the Hitachi acquisition. We are also now operating in a market with much less competition than we have had in the past, and it will be interesting to see how prices hold up.The negative thesis on WDC and STX has generally been that they are each tied to the PC market and that the decline in PC sales will be devastating to them. On the other hand, there is significant evidence that they will profit from the ever expanding need for cheap storage at data centers. In this regard, WDC has increased enterprise sales from 1.7 million units to 6.6 million units on a year over year quarterly basis as of the last quarter (based on information on its most recent quarterly earnings report filed with the SEC). The financial impacts of these changes are likely to be revealed in the next several quarters.WDC and STX are now priced for the worst possible expectations in terms of income and cash flow. Pundits have been predicting the demise of these companies for a very long time, and they just keep cranking out cash flow. At this point, the purchase of these two stocks offers one of the better risk reward trade offs in the market today.Disclosure: I am long STX, WDC.

1144821,39791,2013-01-30T17:13:28-05:00,,"Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) is the largest player in the global hard disk drive industry, which has been characterized by cycles of peaks and troughs. There is little differentiation in the hard drive industry, which means that customers buy mainly based on price per storage unit. However, Seagate stock has surged by more than 100% over the last couple of years, as the industry has consolidated around two players. A spate of M&A has made Seagate and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) the two dominant players in the industry. The earnings for both companies have spiked due to improving margins and revenue. Seagate has rapidly increased both dividends and buybacks as it has returned the windfall gains to investors. Though both the earnings and stock price have gone up, the valuation multiples have not meaningfully expanded, due to investor fears about this being a temporary peak in the HDD cycle and the threat from NAND Flash memory. This means that the stock is still quite cheap despite the stock price outperformance.Why you should buy SeagateRisksSummaryThe biggest risk with Seagate is whether the margin and revenue improvement marks a cyclical peak. We don't think STX faces the threat of new entrants into the HDD industry. The biggest risk is substitution of HDDs by solid state drives (SSDs) and lower HDD sales due to PC unit declines. However the low valuation means that the stock is already discounting at least some of these risks. Given the earnings yield of ~20%, investors can recover their entire investment in just five years, even without the company not growing at all. Seagate remains a good investment in our view despite the stock price increase, as the company will continue to benefit from changed industry dynamics. The stock has corrected slightly after announcing a weak demand environment in the current quarter. We would be looking to buy Seagate on dips, given that the stock price is touching new all-time highs. We think another good memory investment might be Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) because of the ongoing consolidation in the DRAM and NAND industry. MU potentially represents Seagate of a year ago when the stock rose by ~80%.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1247951,24276,2013-03-05T12:53:42-05:00,,"The handwriting is on the wall for hard disks, the spinning aluminum disks that have been the standard for mass storage since before I started covering technology.The increased capacity, falling price, and greater durability of chip-based memory has been steadily making inroads into the hard drive market. Devices like mobile phones and tablets are known for having no moving parts at all - no hard drive sales there.With chip drives, called Solid State Drives or SSDs, now poised to move into the data center, because they deliver data much faster than a hard drive can, and with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) having moved to a ""hybrid"" drive - combining chips and disk - for its Macintosh line, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) have made the smart move into making such hybrids standard.While Western Digital has just begun shipping hybrids, in 500 MB and 1 terabyte sizes - to its OEM customers, Seagate says it is committing fully to the new technology, dropping its most popular disk-only drives from the consumer line and committing fully to what it now calls Solid State Hybrid Drives or SSHDs.The question for investors is, how far can this ""can't beat 'em, better join 'em"" strategy take these companies?Fact is both are already near their peaks, in terms of price. STX is currently trading at $32.40, 17% higher than its price of a year ago. WDC, at $48 and is up 25% year-over-year.To many, it makes no long-term sense. If chip-based memory is the coming thing, why are the hard drive makers drawing a big bid? It could be high short interest - Western Digital is one of the most-shorted stocks on the street. It could also be the continuing take-over rumors around Seagate- none of which have come true.Both companies are heavily favored by institutions. Both companies draw three, four and five star ratings from major ratings groups. Samsung holds a big stake in Seagate, about 10%, and Hitachi holds a similar-sized stake in Western Digital.Still, these are products that are coming to the end of their useful life, as even their makers are admitting with this latest tweak. While Western Digital is now the 19th largest maker of SSDs, the successor technology, and Seagate is 22nd. Their best routes to growth in this sector may lie in buying one of the existing SSD players, like troubled OCZ (NASDAQ:OCZ). But even there it's hard to see a long-term future - the big memory chip players are starting to make their own drives, and would surely squeeze out such a play over time.So, with SSDs taking over, with even these two hard drive leaders admitting it with the move to hybrids, how long can they maintain these high valuations? Only as long as they can keep churning out profits. Seagate sports a 3.7% yield and a PE lower than that of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) while WDC has a lower yield but higher earnings multiple.The bottom line is that these are what I call harvesting stocks. They are harvesting profits in their technology space as that space slowly withers away. The move to hybrids is proof of how their time is passing. If you want to play here, go for the yield, but be prepared to jump at short notice.These companies are paying you to own them. When they can no longer pay, the bottom will drop out. And their latest moves show that time is coming. It's too early to recommend a short, but that time is coming.Disclosure: I am long AAPL.

There is no excuse at this point for not investing in Seagate, in my mind.An investment in Seagate covers all your investing needs.Aside from hyper-volatile penny stocks that can deliver enormous growth (and enormous losses), Seagate can achieve any goal you want in investing.Want some dividends? Seagate offers a 4% dividend per year, comparable to many dividend giants that come to mind.Want a stock that's going to grow in price in a stable fashion? Seagate's share price has significant growth potential with its obscenely sexy P/E of 5. The threats to Seagate's profits have been addressed by the company, and as analysts are finally beginning to notice, some threats aren't all that applicable anymore.I cannot name another investment that contributes to me sleeping soundly at night like Seagate does.Why Seagate over Western Digital?The dividend is one reason. Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) dividend is a mediocre 2%, barely enough to beat inflation even in this low-inflation environment. Since Seagate offers double that, I think any rational investor will like Seagate twice as much as WDC. I certainly do, anyhow.Then there's P/E ratio. WDC is a healthy 7 or so, which is nothing to balk at. However, I like Seagate's 5 much better.Then, of course, there's my personal opinion of its products. I hate working with WDC drives. In my experience, WDC's drives are finicky, irritating, and not very durable; I have never had any issues with my Seagate drives. Startup cloud companies agree. You'll notice one of the images very close to the bottom shows a Seagate drive, or you can see a Seagate drive within the construction montage in the video.To the potential investor saying: ""I've missed the boat, though!""So you missed out on the nice gain last week, and are worried about a pullback. I don't blame you, in this crazy market. After all, this is a market where companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) get ridiculous valuations despite obvious signs that their profits cannot increase to the levels investors expect them to.However, I don't feel that those of you who are not long Seagate right now have missed out on too much, at least compared with what growth is to come. Seagate's price has a lot of room to grow as demonstrated by its P/E. Demand for data storage will not decrease anytime soon, and as I mentioned in my previous article (linked at the beginning of the article) about Seagate, tunnel-vision analysis of declining PC HDD sales will not result in an accurate view of Seagate's earning potential.Will there be a pullback? I won't claim to know, but I do feel the market is overvalued in general. While waiting may present a good entry point, I wouldn't wait more than a couple of months. If there is a correction, and if Seagate follows the market in this hypothetical pullback, Seagate will be a stock that I will happily sink all of my money into.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in STX over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1161431,25255,2013-02-06T15:02:27-05:00,,"In this article I'll give you 6 straightforward reasons to research further the second biggest hard drive manufacturer in the world, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). I believe that Seagate is caught in the ""PC is dead"" hype and that it's currently significantly undervalued. Here are the reasons why:1) Free Cash Flow And EarningsSeagate is expected to earn $5.24/share for fiscal 2013 and $5.45/share for fiscal 2014. Seagate's fiscal year ends in June, so these estimates are for 6 and 18 months into the future.Free cash flow for fiscal 2013 is expected at $8.16 per share and the company is committed to give it all back to shareholders as you'll read below.Summing up, the stock trades at just 6.5 times earnings and 4.2 times its free cash flow.2) Share BuybacksUnless the world-wide economic recovery stops, Seagate will generate approximately $1.5 billion in FCF until June 2013. About $300 million of that will go to dividends and the rest are for the company to buy back its stock. It could buy as much 30 million shares (which is 8% of its current market cap) assuming a $40 average execution price.From Seagate's Q2 2013, earnings call transcript:If it continues generating FCF at the same pace until fiscal 2014, Seagate may repurchase 24% (90 million shares) of its current self within a year and a half.A quick note: That means a 31% boost to EPS, which means a 31% boost to Seagate's fair value.3) DividendThis is as straightforward as it gets. Seagate pays a $1.52 per share cash dividend which yields 4.5% at its current stock price.This costs the company about $600 ($1.52 X 380 mln of diluted shares) but as we mentioned above Seagate generates more than $3 billion of FCF per year ($8.16 X 380 mln diluted shares).4) MoatAnd while so far the company's business has been cyclical in nature, with ups and downs in revenue and FCF, there have been some recent developments that have changed the landscape quite a bit.The developments I'm referring to are the acquisition of Samsung's hard-drive unit by Seagate and the acquisition of Hitachi's hard-drive unit by Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).These deals are important because the HDD industry is now highly consolidated with Seagate and Western Digital controlling more than 85% of the market. Western Digital controls 45% and Seagate 42%.This enables both Seagate and WDC to keep their margins higher than their historical averages and smooth out the impact of declining HDD sales (due to SSDs) to their bottom line.5) GrowthBeing a dominant player in the HDD market gives Seagate another advantage. Its massive cash flow gives it the ability to expand rapidly within the SSD market and thus secure its future and cover for the decline in HDDS.Furthermore as you can see below the IHS projections for the next couple of years aren't that bad for HDD. Their decline seems to be extremely smooth.Let's sum up:I believe that Seagate, given its prospects, is worth around 8 to 10 times its 2013 EPS. That's a $42 to $52 value range for the stock.And now let's close with my bonus fact about Seagate:The famous value investor David Einhorn owns the stock. Check him out, look at his track record and you'll understand why I list him as positive to research this stock.Disclosure: You should do your own homework before buying this stock. This article isn't supposed to be a full fledged analysis but a list with reasons to do further research on this company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1104791,24063,2013-01-10T08:26:42-05:00,,"By Jake MannIn the hedge fund world, there aren't too many money managers that are more well known than David Einhorn. Einhorn, the manager of Greenlight Capital, has attained ""rock star"" status due to a number of high-profile short sales, including Lehman Brothers, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ:GMCR) and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG). It's worth noting, though, that Einhorn has also amassed quite the long equity portfolio, as seen in his 13F filings with the SEC.At Insider Monkey, we track these filings, which indicate that Greenlight Capital had 13F holdings worth a little over $6 billion at the end of the third quarter. Here's Einhorn's full equity portfolio. While you may have known that the hedge fund manager has a penchant for tech stocks--his No. 1 holding is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and over one-third of his 13F is invested in the technology sector--Einhorn also has investments in high-dividend stocks.We're going to take you through his top stock pick for serious income investors; it wouldn't be a bad idea to consider adding it to your portfolio. After all, our research shows (see Beat the Market by More Than 20 Percentage Points by Imitating Hedge Funds) that investors can outperform the broader indices by imitating the smart money. Let's get started.Einhorn's No. 2 pick in his 13F portfolio is Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), which currently pays a projected dividend yield of 4.8%. The company, which made over $14 billion in revenues between June 2011 and June 2012, primarily focuses on hard disk data storage. In terms of market share, Seagate holds a 42% stake of the HDD space, second to only Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) at 45%, according to data from IHS.Zacks is quick to point out that Seagate's chief bullish thesis, at least qualitatively speaking, is that ""mobile and consumer electronics markets offers substantial incremental growth opportunities,"" and we'd have to agree. The sell-side forecasts Seagate's earnings to grow a modest 14.5% over the next five years, which is far above what's expected of Western Digital (4.8%) during this time. Moreover, the markets are also giving STX at a much cheaper growth valuation--PEG of 0.29-- compared to Western Digital, which sports a PEG near 1.2.Other industry peers like EMC Corporation (EMC), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and SanDisk (SNDK) also trade at more expensive earnings growth multiples, the lowest of which--SNDK--is still far more expensive than Seagate with a PEG of 1.2. Interestingly, this trio is expected to see EPS growth of 14-15% a year over the next half-decade on average, nearly identical to Seagate's forecast. The difference, though, that investors can capitalize on is that the latter is being treated like a low-growth stock when, frankly, it isn't.Looking at that dividend yield in particular, which is much more generous than Western Digital's yield of 2.4%, we can see that at a payout ratio near 20%, Seagate has the capacity to fatten shareholders' wallets if it so desires. According to its last 10-K, the company was sitting on a little over $2 billion in investable cash in June, and close to three-quarters of this asset base was in high-liquidity investments like money market funds and commercial paper.While investors did receive a modest dividend boost at the end of last year, it's certainly possible we'll see an even better yield by the end of 2013. In absolute terms, Seagate has nearly quadrupled its payout since the start of 2008, so a bullish historical precedent has been established.Obviously, Seagate and Western Digital have high exposure to the PC business, which is in secular decline according to likely everyone but the ""I'm a PC"" spokesman from the humorous Apple commercials of years past. It's tempting to ignore the consolidative efforts of Seagate in recent years, having acquired Samsung's HDD business in 2011, but ardent investors should pay close attention. This is a move CEO Steve Luczo called ""an exciting time in the industry with rapidly evolving opportunities in many markets including mobile computing, cloud computing, and solid state storage.""In addition to simply expanding Seagate's presence in emerging markets like China, Brazil and Russia, the deal also helped the company boost its presence in the mobile storage arena. This represents the key growth driver for Seagate moving forward, and is what can help the stock meet the Street's earnings forecast mentioned above.Earlier this week, at the Consumer Electronics Show, Seagate shed some light on ""the next evolution of the company's wireless storage category,"" according to eWeek. Dubbed the Wireless Plus, Seagate's newest entry into the mobile storage space ""is designed to stream content wirelessly for up to eight smartphones or tablets with enough space for up to 500 high-definition movies.""While this isn't Seagate's first entry into the space--that came in 2011-- the latest Wireless Plus gives users the ability to ""wirelessly upload"" content from mobile devices. Access on the iPhone, for example, will come through the Seagate Media app, which is free to download. The Wireless Plus itself costs $199.99 for the 1 TB version.It's clear that a continued presence in this industry presents the best growth opportunity for Seagate, and at its valuation and healthy dividend yield, investors of all philosophies can find something to like about the stock. Certainly, we can see why it is Einhorn's No. 2 stock pick behind Apple.

1134361,41741,2013-01-25T13:54:26-05:00,,"With the buyout talks of Dell heating up and the rekindling of a potential buyout of Best Buy back on the table, we decided to find out what one of billionaire David Einhorn and Greenlight Capital's top picks has been up since its run in with the LBO markets in 2010. Seagate Technology (STX) rejected a potential buyout in 2010 by private equity firms, claiming that the price was too low. Since the tech company rejected the buyout bid in 2010, the stock has surged 145%, compared to the NASDAQ Index's 25%. Many hedge funds, along with Einhron, have been buying up shares of Seagate, including Jim Simons and Ken Griffin (check out all the hedge funds in love with Seagate).Billionaire David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital jumped into Seagate during the first quarter of 2011 by buying up 3.2 million shares. At the time he joined fellow billionaire Eddie Lampert of ESL Investments who owned 7.9 million shares. Since then ESL has dumped almost all of its shares, but Einhorn has managed to up his ownership to 16.5 million shares -- almost 5% of Seagate's outstanding shares (check out Lampert's newest picks).Buyout rejection. Seagate ended the latest buyout talks in 2010, which would have been its second takeover in the last decade. While some analysts thought that the termination of a buyout was no surprise, citing the fact that the industry was in decline and fundamentals would remain weak for the foreseeable future. This has not been the case. After the buyout of Seagate was abandoned, some analysts noted that the future free cash flow for the hard disk drive makers was highly uncertain, where one ThinkEquity analyst estimated the numbers to be $1.2 million annually, an underestimate to say the least.Lots of cash. In early 2012, Seagate upped its stock buyback plan to an authorized $3.5 billion in an effort to return cash to shareholders. Returning cash to shareholders should continue to be the norm, where the company has already amassed $2.4 billion.The free cash flow generation by Seagate has been very impressive over the past few years:Seagate's dividend of $0.38 (quarterly) makes up an earnings payout of only 13%. Going a step further, this $0.38 per share dividend, which his a total payout of $513 million by the company annually, is well covered by the $2.4 billion the company has in cash on hand.Industry remains in an uptrend. Forbes sees the amount of digital content that needs to be stored as still growing at a robust rate, suggesting a peak in hard disk drive drive being many years away. Coughlin Associates believes the industry still has room to grow, suggesting the demand for hard disks will continue to grow through 2017. This includes the notable rise in disk drive demand for use in mobile devices. Source: Coughlin Associates, ForbesRoom to move higher. Seagate has been hitting on a number of cylinders and the numbers suggest upside for the stock remains.Other notable companies operating in the computer parts business includes Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Of these major competitors, Seagate trades near the very bottom on a forward price to earnings basis and the lowest on a price to sales:This low valuation versus other major tech peers is low in my opinion. The other companies have much more exposure to the declining PC industry and do not as robust industry drivers, where even Gartner expects worldwide HDD shipments to grow at a 5.1% compound annual growth rate from 2011 through 2016.Although 2013 might be a down year for Seagate, as it continues to feel the pressure of a struggling global economy and weak IT spending, 2014 is expected to rebound nicely:I believe that Seagate could easily see multiples expansion, namely its price to earnings ratio, thanks to market share gains and higher expected prices. The flooding in Thailand had little impact on Seagate, but strained Western Digital and Toshiba's manufacturing capabilities, allowing Seagate to capture more of the market. Seagate also snapped up Samsung's hard disk business in late-2011, which has been expected to expand Seagate's production capacity by as much as 33%.Also driving top line growth should be a return to higher prices in the hard disk drive market, where IHS iSuppli believes pricing should reach pre-flood levels in 2014.Applying the peer average forward price to earnings ratio from above to Seagate's 2014 expected earnings offers investor's the following:The suggested gross undervaluing of Seagate shares does not account for its 4% plus dividend yield or potential share buybacks.In stacking Seagate up against its top competitor Western Digital, we still find significant value opportunities in Seagate shares:Western Digital is trading at an EV/EBITDA (enterprise value to EBITDA) multiple of 3.8, compared to Seagate's 2.75. Assuming Seagate should trade more in line with Western Digital's 3.8, the stock could be undervalued by as much as 25%. Billionaire activist investor David Einhorn increased his stake by 60% during the second quarter last year, giving another boost of confidence to the company (check out all of Einhorn's top picks).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1069261,24105,2012-12-17T16:32:29-05:00,,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) are among the most unloved of the despised tech sector (justifying the ""ugly sisters"" label). The stocks are trading at ridiculously low price earnings multiples, which imply that they are on the verge of going out of business. What is interesting about these two companies is that, partly through acquisitions, they have each grown to a similar size. The two of them now dominate the hard disk drive industry, with a third smaller competitor (Toshiba) tagging along. This duopoly plus a small fry pattern seems to characterize a number of industries and, once this market structure is attained, it seems to stabilize and be hard to change. WDC and STX are similar in other ways. They both have fiscal years ending at the end of June (June 29 this past year) which makes comparisons easier. They both recently acquired a large competitor (STX acquired the hard disk drive operations of Samsung: WDC acquired the hard disk drive operations of Hitachi). In each case this greatly increased capacity and sales volume. They each have been targeting some acquisitions upstream to better control input costs.Anyhow, the table below provides per share data based on the full fiscal year ending this past June. The net cash and share count data are based on the most recent financial reports (for the quarter ending September, 2012) filed with the SEC. The other data is based on the annual reports for the fiscal year ending June 29, 2012, as filed with the SEC.WDC has elected to use cash flow to pay down debt and build up balance sheet cash while STX has been more aggressive buying back stock and paying dividends. They each have plenty of cash flow for all of these purposes so it will be interesting to see what they do with their cash in the next couple of years. STX recently bought a large competitor by issuing a lot of stock and they have already bought back more than enough stock to offset the extra issuance. STX's price earnings ratio based on the last full fiscal year is an amazing 4.1. In fairness, it is universally acknowledged that fiscal 2012 was somewhat of an anomaly because of shortages and high prices for disk drives created by idiosyncratic circumstances and that this level of earnings is not sustainable. The table below provides consensus projected total revenue and earnings per share for the two companies for the present fiscal year (the year ending June, 2013, and the fiscal year ending June, 2014 from Yahoo Finance.STX is certainly headed for a decline, but the consensus decline would still leave it trading at a little more than five times earnings. WDC is a bit larger and - because of its net balance sheet cash - actually has a lower Enterprise Value (WDC=$7.79B; STX=$10.94B). But. of course, STX has a much more generous dividend. You may hear investors debate the comparative merits of these two stocks. I think it is a silly debate and that an investor who is not so pessimistic about the sector's future prospects that he believes the low PEs are justified should just buy them both. By doing so, an investor minimizes competitive risk (the risk that WDC or STX will gain a big market share and margin advantage over the other) and can make a ""bet"" solely based on his view of whether the pricing is overly pessimistic given the prospects of the sector.So the real issue is the fate of this sub-industry. The conventional wisdom is that the industry's fate is inexorably tied to the PC and that PC's are in decline as users switch to tablets which will not need hard disk drives. So, these valuations reflect the consensus ""Short the PC!"" sentiment which is very strong in the market right now. On the other hand, there are external storage needs for hard disk drives that seem to be growing and conventional storage is still cheaper than flash memory. WDC and STX are also in the solid state drive and hybrid drive markets as well. Consensus projections do not seem to foreshadow dire financial results and the normal decline one might see in margins and prices with lower demand may not materialize due to the recent changes in market structure. It will be interesting to see how the duopoly works out. Will the companies pile up huge cash hoards in order to deter one another from aggressive price action the same way incumbent Congressman raise lots of campaign money to deter primary opposition? More importantly, will the other demands for external storage assure a relatively ""soft"" landing?In that regard, I have been hearing that the disk drive business is about to come to an ignominious and financially disastrous end for a number of years now and it appears that a number of smart investors as well as the consensus of analysts believe that a ""soft"" landing is more likely. It is sure nice not to have to count on growth in order to have one's investment thesis pay off and, with the above numbers, all you really need is a slow, rather than a fast, decline. Quarterly financial reports should be carefully analyzed for directional trends in revenue and margin and to determine each company's strategy for deploying free cash flow (share repurchases, build up of balance sheet cash, debt retirement, etc.). Based on current prices, I am long both of these. Of course, these stocks shouldn't sell for 15 times earnings, but 5 times earnings is just a little too cheap.Disclosure: I am long STX, WDC.

1182941,30951,2013-02-14T05:21:17-05:00,,"OverviewSeagate (NASDAQ:STX) designs, manufactures, and markets storage drives for both consumer and enterprise usage. In particular, the company is known for producing standard hard disk drives as well as hybrid (hard disk + NAND flash) drives for PC and data-center use. The commonly accepted belief that is reflected in the company's low-as-dirt valuation is that hard disk drives are on the road to obsolescence at the hands of flash storage.In this article, while I address the quite-justified concerns of the bears, I also offer a counterargument for the long-term viability of the company (and even its core industry) going forward.The Shift To Flash?It is very easy to list the advantages of traditional NAND flash over today's magnetic platter hard disk technology: speed, shock resistance, physical size, and power consumption are all clear advantages for solid state drives. However, the cost per-gigabyte of NAND flash far exceeds that of the traditional hard disk drive components. To put this in perspective: a typical 1 Terabyte (1000 Gigabyte) hard disk is $80, but a 128GB solid state drive costs about $120.While NAND flash prices will come down and cost per gigabyte will improve, the hard disk drive manufacturers also continually make improvements in platter density, which means that for the foreseeable future, users looking to get the most ""bang for their buck"" will undoubtedly choose to go with an HDD.However, there are a couple of main arguments that Seagate bulls need to address:Case #1: Consumers Shift Away From Hard Disk DrivesLet's address the worst-case scenario: customers move almost entirely away from hard disk drives in their notebook computers and/or move to flash-based tablets. This means that users now have to contend with 16GB - 128GB of primary storage. This should be sufficient for storing the user's apps, a few documents, and a game, but what about consumers that like to enjoy things such as:These people (which, I would guess, is most) have two options:In the first case, the cloud service providers have scores of hard disk drives storing all of that content, which means that Seagate wins. While these datacenters also have some sort of flash acceleration (think Fusion-io (NYSE:FIO)) to give nearly the speed of an all-flash solution, the bulk of the storage is on inexpensive hard disk drives. In the second case, Seagate wins by selling external hard disk drives.Case #2: Consumers Go HybridI noted above that many datacenters utilize flash caching technologies in order to get full leverage from the investments in both HDDs and flash technology. The same principles can be applied to the consumer space with hybrid solutions. These come in two forms:As I stated above, flash is expensive. However, the next generation of mainstream PCs/Ultrabooks will need to compete with tablets on responsiveness if they want to stand a chance of surviving in the long run. This means that some sort of flash solution is going to be required, but at the same time, PCs need to be able to offer an advantage when it comes to raw storage capacity at a solid price point.I believe that hybrid solutions, whether in a single drive or in an HDD/SSD pairing, are going to be the future of the mainstream PC. Don't just take my word for it, though. Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) ""Ultrabook"" specification mandates some sort of flash solution to be included in a computer in order for it to get the ""Ultrabook"" designation. A look at the list of Ultrabooks shows that the SSD + HDD combination is quite popular at the lower end (but not so much at the higher end):Further, for more specialized uses such as:The amount of data that is needed/stored is enormous. Professionals will continue to need as much local storage as they can get, and solid state drives just aren't going to cut it.The case for hard disk drives is clear: bulk storage is needed somewhere, whether it's on the client side or on the server side.A Solid State FutureThat being said, Seagate is not blind, and is doing the right things to future-proof its enterprise business. The thing with flash storage is that in the commodity parts of the business (i.e. consumer SSDs), the guys with the NAND fabs win, since NAND is a commodity. Think Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Intel, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), and Hynix. To ""win"" in this space without a NAND fab, the differentiation really needs to be at the total solution level (in particular, software).Seagate has made a few very sharp strategic moves to insure its long-term viability in enterprise flash:Clearly the company is aiming at the high margin, high ASP segments of the market that do not depend necessarily on having the best cost on NAND. Seagate will be a player in enterprise flash, securing its long-term position as a complete storage provider.ConclusionThe stock is cheap, and the short sellers were desperate to cover on that drop to the $33 level, quickly sending shares back to the $35 zone.The company continues to increase its dividend (and given EPS of $5.75 projected for the year, that $1.52/share dividend has a lot of room to grow), buy back an enormous amount of shares, and is well positioned for the future. The 36M shares short will eventually be squeezed as Seagate proves its long-term viability (they already seem desperate to cover), so buy any major dip whenever you get the opportunity. There is plenty of demand for this stock whenever it gets cheaper.I'm keeping this one on my watchlist and plan to pounce on any major pullback.Disclosure: I am long INTC.

1286031,46081,2013-03-19T11:26:18-04:00,,"I hear many analysts and investors citing solid-state drives as the downfall of companies like Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). The logic is that these two companies will become obsolete and profitless in a matter of years because they have not moved into the mobile/SSD market.Here is a quote from S&P Capital IQ's Stock Report (March 16, 2013):At first glance, it seems a valid argument. While they could be right about earnings expectations being too high, there are a few problems with their other line of reasoning. These solid-state drives do cut into Seagate's desktop drive market share, but Seagate has been non-responsive to the solid-state market for several good reasons:The true source of revenue here for STX is the sale of cloud storage drives. Every day demand for cloud storage increases at an almost exponential rate. The more people that get connected to the internet, the more storage is needed, for everything from e-mail to personal data like pictures and videos, to business applications that need to be readily accessible anywhere, at any time.Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and to a lesser extent, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have been battling it out over the cloud storage market. Guess who the real winner here is? That's right. I'm willing to bet 95% of the drives used for that storage are made either by Seagate or Western Digital.That's only the beginning, though. Both Seagate and Western Digital have essentially hit critical mass in terms of storage per unit area as well. We've known about this physical limit for a while now.Note the date in that article: 2001.Engineers have hit a wall, not due to lack of technology or lack of innovation, but due to the physical limits of the material used to store data. While there are several promising ideas that could increase storage per unit area by several orders of magnitude, these ideas are years from being cost-effective. In addition, Seagate has been leading the development of these next-generation drives. Should this technology become viable, it will be Seagate that releases the first production drive of the HAMR variety. In any event, Seagate has their place in the cloud computing market secured.Barring these HAMR drives becoming viable (which, as mentioned above, would be yet another boon for Seagate), there is only one other solution to increased storage demand: Seagate must manufacture more and more of the current drives.This is where the viability of a long position in STX comes into view. There is a growing market for their product, and competition is relatively low. Once investors begin to understand Seagate's new role in the world, the stock price should appreciate nicely as well.Seagate may not have desktop drives flying off the shelves like they used to, but they now have an even larger market to deliver to: the storage needs of the entire world.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in STX over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

I plan to re-take my long position before the next dividend."
1114971,23479,2013-01-16T11:32:49-05:00,,"Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX) is a leading provider of electronic data storage products such as hard disk drives for personal storage and enterprise applications. Its main products are hard disk drives or HDDs. Seagate manufactures electronic data storage products, addressing a broad spectrum of clients such as enterprise applications, client compute applications and client non-compute applications.In an earlier note title A Snapshot Of Seagate's Key Businesses And $33 Price Estimate we gave a snapshot of the company's main businesses. Below we look at some of the key drivers to Seagate's business as well as trends supporting the growth of the storage business.The high growth of digital content is driving the need for high capacity storage to aggregate, host, distribute, manage, backup and use digital content. The need to access rich data and content is being driven by a highly mobile and increasingly connected user base. The traditional enterprise and client compute markets will continue to demand high capacity storage solutions and will be best served by hard disk drives, where manufacturers compete on the ability to deliver cost effective, reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices. The increasing demand for HD content for media consumption and rich formats such as HD DVD and Blu-Ray, drives the demand for high capacity disk drives solutions in the end-user market.According to Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), the global cloud traffic will grow at an annual rate of 45% and reach 4.3 zetabytes by 2016, while global data center traffic will grow to 6.6 zetabytes. Nearly 20% of this data will be solely due to online video streaming, email and music. Seagate is leveraging this end-user content creating phenomenon with value add products focusing on consumers such as DVR backups and wireless backup networks as well as media storage devices designed to connect easily with different media sources such as TV's, radios and gaming consoles.Pricing TrendsIn early October 2011, flooding in Bangkok, Thailand, caused many manufacturing industrial parks to shut down operations. Factories supporting the HDD industry's supply chain were concentrated within these industrial parks to reduce costs and improve logistics, and during this temporary suspension of operations, demand exceeded supply, leading to high prices in HDD's. This led to higher prices for the industry's average selling price per unit. Seagate's ASP for hard disks, surged from $55 in the third quarter to $68 in the fourth quarter of 2011. The industry has recovered since the flooding, and we believe that the prices will stabilize and then begin to fall as operations ramp up again. According to leading market research firm iSuppli, this is the primary reason for Seagate's leading position in the HDD market in the recent quarters, as it was the least affected.Shift From Hard Disk Drives To Solid State DrivesAll leading laptop manufacturers are now offering laptops with a hybrid HDD-SSD primary memory and high-end high-performance laptops with complete SSD memory. Solid state drives are much more expensive per GB, and this is the primary reason for the slow adoption of SSD as the primary memory component. As production capacity increases and technology changes leads to a drop in SSD prices, we can expect that solid state drives will become a standard for notebooks and netbooks. These drives are unlikely to find extensive use in desktops in the near future.Seagate was late to adapt to this trend and has been making investments into companies such as LaCie and DensBits to acquire know-how in the SSD and USB flash storage market. We currently estimate its market share to be in the low single digit figures, but the company has sales clout and production facilities to quickly gain market share.Rise Of The Tablet ComputerAll tablet computers use solid state memory chips as their primary storage memory, and we estimate that tablet sales will outstrip notebook and netbook sales by the end of our forecast period. HDD memory is relatively unresponsive, slow and bulky and will not find application in tablet computers. The increasing popularity of tablet computers is the primary reason for growth in the SSD space. We estimate that tablet computer sales will outstrip that of laptop sales by the end of our forecast period and this is a major trend shaping the storage industry.Growth In Cloud Computing And Remote Storage ServicesWe expect Seagate's enterprise business to be driven by businesses deploying cloud computing environments in an effort to pool resources and cut costs. Remote storage is becoming a standard for most enterprises and has even gained traction with retail customers with services like iCloud, Dropbox, Skydrive and Google Drive. To achieve the high performance needed with cloud computing, we can expect the hybrid SSD-HDD enterprise storage drives to become popular in the future.We currently have a $33 Trefis Price Estimate for Seagate, which is in-line with its current market price.Disclosure: No positions"

1040451,30951,2012-12-03T06:01:32-05:00,,"BackgroundIt is now time to draw investors' attention to one of the more boring parts of technology. The company that I'm about to mention doesn't make things that go into tablets or smartphones. It draws very little media hype, and the share price has been on a fairly clearly defined down-trend for the last couple of months. Best of all, it trades for what could only be described as incredibly pessimistic valuations. Interested?The company that I'm talking about is Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX). Seagate, for those of you who are unfamiliar with this ""old"" technology company, makes hard-disk drives. Yep. The tried-and-true, magnetic-platter based storage products that go into PCs, servers, game-consoles, and anything else that requires lots of (relatively) inexpensive storage. Of course, with the advent of solid state drives, coupled with the incessant perpetuation of the ""death of the PC"" by the sell-side analysts and the media, Seagate and its rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) are down in the dumps with single digit P/E ratios (3.32 and 4.46, respectively).Now, I would generally not recommend buying a company - let a lone a technology company - on valuation alone. What's cheap can get cheaper and what's pricey can get pricier. I can, however, recommend buying a high-quality, high-yielding company so long as the dividend is safe and growing. Does Seagate fit the bill? It sure does.The Dividend Is SustainableSeagate, as of the most recent dividend increase, pays $1.52 per share on an annualized basis. At the most recent close of $25.10, this represents a 6.05% yield. Further, the dividend has been growing at a fairly rapid clip. At the beginning of 2012, Seagate paid $1.25/share on an annualized basis. Of course, management saw fit to increase the dividend earlier this year to $1.28/share annualized. And, on 11/29, Seagate once again announced another dividend hike to today's $1.52 annualized. This is some very high-powered dividend growth.It seems too good to be true, but is it? Well, in the current trailing twelve month period, Seagate has earned $7.52/share, meaning that the payout ratio is a modest 20.2%. More importantly, the company generated $3.5B in free-cash-flow over the last 12 months. A quick look at the following slide from Seagate's most recent analyst day presentation gives investors insight on just how Seagate's FCF is allocated:This is quite investor friendly: 55% in FY13 of FCF goes to buybacks and 15% to dividends. So even today's 6% dividend yield is quite conservative compared to what could potentially be paid out. More importantly, with such aggressive buybacks, the total payout per dividend shrinks, meaning that even if the actual amount paid total remains fixed, investors get a larger piece of that pie.So what this all means is: that big fat dividend is pretty miniscule to what the company could afford to pay if it shifted resources away from buybacks and towards dividends. It's safe and can be counted on -- it's not a trap.But Wait, Aren't Hard Disks Dead?The above argument for the safety of Seagate's dividend hinges on the firm's ability to generate FCF. The ability of the firm to generate FCF depends on the company's ability to sell hard-disk drives. So, naturally, if people stop buying hard-disk drives, Seagate generates zero cash and investors are left holding the bag. This very fear is why the company trades at 3.32x earnings. This fear is also not warranted.While solid state drives/NAND flash will certainly take the client market by storm with their speed and power-efficiency, for every gigabyte of ""bulk"" storage that disappears from the actual devices, a gigabyte on a cloud server somewhere needs to be there for the device. That gigabyte probably resides on a hard disk.Hard disk drives are incredibly cheap on a per-gigabyte basis. While hard disk drives typically cost $0.03 - $0.05 per gigabyte, solid state drives will run from $0.50 - $1.00 per gigabyte. Clearly for a large database or web-server, going pure solid state is not economically viable. Having the two work in tandem - with the hard disk holding the data and a flash solution acting as a cache - is the solution that seems to be working now and what will be working for the foreseeable future.In the client space, while pure SSDs are certainly gaining traction, the more likely mainstream solution is what we are seeing on many Ultrabooks: hybrid solutions. These solutions either consist of a discrete, usually small solid state drive paired with a large hard disk drive or a hybrid drive that contains both NAND flash built into the same package as the magnetic disk platters. The hybrid solutions are fast and give nearly the same performance as the pure solid state drive products, making them an attractive option for those who want both speed and bulk storage without compromise.Conclusion - Buy, Buy, BuyBuy and hold Seagate. Its dividend is safe, large, and growing, and the core business isn't about to go away. There will always be a need for mass storage, even if it gets tucked away into the cloud. Seagate generates gobs of free cash flow, is aggressively buying back shares, and is run by solid management that has been very generously upping the dividend at every chance it gets.If you're getting paid at least 6% annually on your initial investment - and that's not even including any capital gains on the stock - how can a dividend growth investor resist at these levels? I know I couldn't. Disclosure: I am long STX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

Unlike companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) that increase in value at triple digit multiples in a year perpetuated mainly on hype and lofty forward expectations, Seagate's increase more closely resembles that of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Seagate has been much more thoughtful in its business plan execution and in firming up its financials as it has expanded.In the past year, the company has increased overall revenues by almost 57%, $4.482 billion compared to $2.859 billion. The firm has also completed (and is in the middle of) several acquisitions that will allow it to have an even larger market share and presence in the hard disk drive space. Seagate also is in the middle of a massive share repurchase program. The firm plans to reduce the number of outstanding shares by 250 million by 2014, not to mention the 100 million shares that the company has bought back in prior years. This stock repurchase is also accompanied with a higher than average dividend that currently is yielding 4.20%.These large share repurchases have helped push up the overall EPS (6.49) figures for the company and ultimately has pushed down the P/E for the stock, which is currently at 4.65. The company currently is sitting on $2.118 billion in cash, has a net profit margin of 22.60%, a book value of $8.83, and has a free cash flow of $2.616 billion. Seagate is easily the leader in the hard disk drive space and continues to position itself to continue that upward trajectory.Unfortunately, no great company is without its problems, and Seagate is no different. In the past month, the company has been downgraded four times, with analysts citing weaker than normal PC sales. Seagate's stock has also been getting affected by the negative comments coming out of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Dell (NYSE:DELL), and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) citing weaker consumer and business demand for PCs, accompanied with a slower than expected economy. Additionally, the overall market worries that continue to persist regarding Iran, the fiscal cliff, the presidential election, and tax/regulation uncertainties continue to pressure the overall market and will affect Seagate's stock price.Looking past all of the current short-term negativities surrounding Seagate, I am still very optimistic on the firm's future regarding its business portfolio and overall market valuation. All of this bad news is not ideal for Seagate's stock price, but market negativity at times can create an excellent buying opportunity, and I feel that this is indeed one of those times.When looking at the chart of Seagate, one can see that the stock has trended up for majority of the year, but while doing this, it has also created strong support and resistance levels that have been tested and have held several times over the course of the year.Going back to February of this year, the $25 - $26 per share level seems to have been the core support level for the stock, with the $32 - $33 level representing the resistance level. With the stock currently at $30 per share, approaching the typical resistance level, and all of the recent negativities for both the company and the economy as a whole, I think there is a very good chance that the stock will sell off and retreat back toward its support price of $25 - $26 per share.Now, for those that are frequent readers of my articles, they will know that I never like to just sit around and hope that the stock will eventually come down in price to my ideal purchase price. Instead, I like to look at the options market to help me slowly accumulate a position over time while still getting paid to wait for the stock to come down in price. I do this usually with selling of cash secured puts on the stock at the strike prices that I would prefer to buy the stock at.Selling puts basically obligates the seller to purchase the stock at that price for the equivalent number of put option contracts that were sold (1 contract = 100 shares of stock). At expiration of the option contract if the stock is at or below the option's strike price, the seller will be obligated to buy 100 shares of stock for every 1 option contract sold at the option strike price, in other words the seller is being 'put' to the stock. If this happens, the seller is still able to keep the premium that was received for selling the puts originally. If the stock price is above your option strike price at expiration, the contracts expire worthless and the sellers get to keep the premium that they received originally for selling the puts.In the case of Seagate, since I believe there is support in the stock price at the $25 - $26 level, I would be a seller of those strikes. I like the January contract month because it is roughly 4 months out and provides for a nice time premium as well as having a lot of the recent volatility being built into the option prices. With that said, I would suggest selling the $26 strike for $1.35 and the $25 strike for $1.10.As for individual strike weighting, I feel that is always up to the sellers and their overall risk tolerance, but for this example, let's assume that 2 options were sold at each strike. Doing that would net the seller $490 in premium received for doing the trade, [($135*2) + ($110*2)]. This trade would also obligate the seller to potentially owning $10,200 of Seagate stock, with a breakeven of $25.50 per share. It is also important to keep in mind that the premium received for doing this trade would help offset some of that purchase price creating a 'real' purchase price of $9,710 and a 'real' breakeven of $24.275 per share. Again, this is assuming that both contracts were to expire in the money and be 'put' to the seller. If only one of the two contracts were to expire in the money and the trader was 'put' to the stock, the premium from the contracts that expired worthless would further offset the 'real' cost of owning the stock.I like this trade as a potential way of entering into a position on Seagate because it offers me the possibility of a lower entry point than the current market price of the stock, as well as paying me to wait to be right. The premium that is collected for the trade creates a 4.80% rate of return (or discount if 'put' to the stock) for waiting to see how the price movement plays out. In the event that the options expire in the money and I have to buy the stock, I not only get to keep the premium that I received for doing the trade, but I now have a stock that is currently yielding 5.27% at my $24.275 breakeven. Overall, I see this trade as a win-win and I would be a buyer of Seagate at the $25 - $26 per share level.Disclosure: I am long STX, AAPL, INTC.

976051,36281,2012-11-03T12:03:25-04:00,,"A few weeks ago, I wrote an article on various opportunities to play the explosive growth of Big Data. In that article, one obvious industry that I did not touch upon is the hard disk drive makers. Clearly as more and more storage space is needed both in enterprise and consumer markets, it would seem logical that those companies who are creating disk drives could stand to benefit.In this article I will take a closer look at my favorite company in this space - Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX). I believe the company is well run, in good financial shape, and will prove to be a good value for shareholders in the coming few years.Business ProspectsIn my article on Big Data, I referenced some figures from this CSC website on the general growth trends of digital storage. I think it's worth repeating here, as it blows my mind every time I read these numbers:IDC has forecasted that the HDD industry specifically will continue to grow at a CAGR of 9.6% until 2016. Indeed, the 19 analysts covering the company have an average 5 year growth rate of 15% for Seagate, which is quite impressive for most any industry. Clearly the company will not grow as fast as the overall data market, as there are many types of data and ways to store it which Seagate's business does not cover. But in general, I think the overall trends in the business remain strong.What are the Risks to Seagate's Business?There are several risks to the traditional hard disk drive business that have been keeping valuations quite low for Seagate and its competitors. A couple of these points are:My personal feeling is that these points will have little negative impact on the growth of the HDD industry in the coming few years. Although SSDs are clearly on the rise and growing at a much faster CAGR than traditional HDDs, they are still have quite a small market share and are significantly more expensive. The following chart shows that the tradeoff between these two is really between capacity vs. performance:Here, we can see that SSDs remain at least 5x more expensive. Although SSDs continue to get cheaper every year, HDDs are also doing the same. This report discusses how between 2011 and 2016, densities of HDDs will more than double. Already, it's expected that 5TB drives using only 5 platters will become common place in the near future. With cloud computing focusing primarily on capacity and large amounts of cost efficient storage, I still believe that HDDs will be the primary medium to do this in the coming few years. Remember, as I showed above, data growth is exploding so rapidly that there is for sure going to be strong growth in all types of storage devices just to try and keep up with the sheer amount of data that consumers and enterprises need to store. Although SSDs bring other benefits including faster performance and less need for cooling systems in data centers, the cost factor will still remain an important element that will keep HDDs on the market for a long time.Seagate is Shareholder FriendlyThere are several points to like here about Seagate in the company's actions toward shareholders:Seagate's Competitive MoatThe hard disk drive industry is dominated by only a few companies. After years of consolidation, Seagate and Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) are the primary players for traditional HDDs. After big mergers recently between Seagate and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Western Digital and Hitachi (OTCPK:HTHIY), the two companies now control close to 85% of HDD market share. There is also evidence that less competition has meant an increase in pricing power. After the Thailand floods in 2011, the prices of disk drives increased by 28% almost overnight. Interestingly, the prices have remained quite high since then. With increasing demands for cloud storage and the general growth trends of data, Seagate is in a strong position to maintain an advantage in this area.Besides pricing power, evidence of the company's competitive advantages is clearly visible in the margins, which are significantly higher than the industry averages. You can see as well how the gap in margins has widened in the last 12 months compared to the past 5 years:While the industry margins are relatively flat, Seagate has shown sustainable improvement. It has also overtaken Western Digital, which in the last 12 months has seen operating and net margins of 15 and 13.6% respectively.Although the market for SSDs is dominated by companies such as SanDisk (SNDK) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Seagate and Western Digital both are looking for ways to also stay relevant in this area as well. Seagate continues to focus strongly on hybrid drives, which combine some of both elements of traditional HDDs and SSDs. The market however is still small for hybrids, and it remains to be seen how this growth will impact the overall competitive advantage of the company.Seagate's Balance SheetSeagate carries a debt load of $2.87B and has a debt/equity ratio of 0.81. This ratio is a bit higher than I normally like, although the current ratio is healthy at over 2. Debt has also been reasonably controlled over the past few years staying in the range between $2-3B. I therefore do not see any major flags or reasons for concern on this aspect.ValuationWith a current P/E ratio around 4 and EV/EBITDA of only 2.64 Seagate could be considered downright cheap. However, some of this low valuation is due to expectation that the currently inflated level of earnings after the 2011 supply shock from the Thailand floods is only temporary. Indeed, the company's EPS increased dramatically to $6.71/share, whereas previously it was less than half of that.With this in mind, I have also performed a simple DCF using GuruFocus. I have used the calculator with the following inputs:This gives me an intrinsic value of $38.71/share.With a current price around $28/share, this implies a margin of safety of 28% which is reasonably attractive. Looking at it another way, the market is currently pricing Seagate for considerable negative earnings growth in the coming years (-10%/annum). However keep in mind that currently the EPS is over $6/share. I have also assumed in my DCF above that the company cannot retain this level, as I expect the price of HDDs will continue to fall after further stabilization of the market. The $3.14/share I used was the earnings from 2010, the last full year before the floods.Therefore, I think this estimate is quite conservative. The growth rate of 10% is well below analysts' estimates and is reasonably in line with the IDC projected rates. I'm also assuming that the company cannot maintain any of the advantaged pricing power it has recently enjoyed, but I expect that in reality they will maintain some of it since the market has consolidated so much.For sure, other storage technologies will continue to grow and take market share (e.g. solid state drives), but the general explosion of data will mean that traditional hard disk drives are still in strong demand. I therefore feel quite confident about the margin of safety currently present in the shares.ConclusionSeagate is a well run company that is trading at an attractive valuation relative to the long term prospects of the data storage industry. I therefore recommend you take a closer look at the company and consider buying it as a good value stock for potential market beating returns over the next few years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

968241,34101,2012-11-01T10:12:16-04:00,,"Hard disk drive maker Seagate Technology's (NASDAQ:STX) outlook for the near term looks sluggish due to weak PC shipment growth and the increasing adoption rate of tablet PCs among the consumers. Aside from this, the outlook provided by the company and its peer Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) for the December quarter is also not encouraging.Seagate reported a surge in net income to $582 million or EPS of $1.42 for Q1 from $140 million or EPS of $1.40 in the last year. On a Non-GAAP basis, net income was $594 million or EPS of $1.45 versus $146 million or EPS of 34 cents in the prior year. Revenues grew to $3.73 billion from $2.81 billion in Q1 last year. Analysts expected the company to earn EPS of $1.67 and revenues of $3.75 billion. The first quarter revenues were below its guidance of $4.0 billion. The company guided Q2 revenues of $3.5 billion, which is lower than the analysts' predictions of $3.74 billion.Source: SeagateThe above table indicates the falling gross margin in the last two quarters suggesting the pricing pressure the company is facing after reaping bumper profits in the second and third quarter following the floods in Thailand in October 2011. Seagate's profit and gross margin are dipping not only due to the weak PC shipment but also because of the easing of hard disk supply. The company and the industry benefited from the Thailand floods as the production was lower than the demand. Thailand accounts for 40% to 45% of global HDD production. However, as the supply started easing in April, the prices of HDD got stabilized. This has resulted in sequentially reduced gross margin for the company.The outlook provided by Seagate and Western Digital are also not encouraging. Western Digital provided outlook for the December quarter that was below the analysts' expectations. The company guided adjusted EPS of $1.65 - $1.86 and revenues of $3.55 - $3.7 billion, whereas analysts' initial prediction of EPS was $2.40 and revenues of $4.08 billion. Currently, the Street is estimating EPS of $1.88 and revenues of $3.71 billion, which are still lower than the company's forecast.Meanwhile, the International Data Corp. or IDC disclosed recently that the global PC shipments contracted 8.6% in the third quarter. This was worse than the IDC's August outlook of a 3.8% year-over-year fall. IDC's senior research analyst Jay Chou added, ""While ultrabook prices have come down a little, there are still some significant challenges that will greet Windows 8 in the coming quarter."" However, the analyst is hopeful of the consumers responding favorably to the new products during the tail end of the fourth quarter. But the guidance provided by two leading HDD makers dispel any hopes of a revival of fortunes at the year end.Interestingly, ahead of the Q1 results, S&P Capital IQ analyst Jin Yin has cut his rating on the shares of Seagate to Sell from Hold and also reduced his price target to $25 from $35. The analyst added, ""We believe demand for hard disk drives will worsen due to a weaker global economy and a secular shift toward tablets. We think the adoption rate of hybrid drives will slow, given the falling prices of solid-state drives. We believe STX will be less aggressive in repurchasing its shares due to increased economic uncertainty.""Given the industry situation, Seagate will continue to face pressure on margins. Therefore, the stock is likely to see more downside pressure in the near term.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

884001,36041,2012-09-24T09:46:03-04:00,,"Seagate Technology (NYSE: STX) has seemed like one of the best stocks over the last 12 months, as evidenced by its share price. However, it has a lot of haters out there for various reasons, including the decline in PC demand. Are these criticisms correct, especially after the most recent warnings from Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ), Dell (NYSE: DELL-OLD), and Intel (NYSE: INTC)? Also, the trends toward SSDs are another reason analysts and investors are staying away from this company. The question comes down to: are these criticisms merited?Description(Source: STX 10-K)Clearly, management outlines that its products are geared toward HDDs. However, if you look past the basic description in the 10-K, one notices all of the products and markets that the company is in. These include enterprise storage, SSDs (Pulsar Family), and PCBAs. Oh wait? STX has SSD exposure? The answer to this is clear, especially as they finish up the full-acquisition of LaCie.IndustryTechnology is what the world circles around, and the sector that has been a quality investment over the last 3 years especially. The debate on the radio station I listened to yesterday was ""What would you do for an iPhone 5?"" Technology is all around us and constantly changing. AAPL launches a new phone every year, and Samsung has increased this turnaround speed to about 6-9 months! Being up-to-date is key in the tech world.HDDs are perceived to be a thing of the past. There are many advantages and disadvantages to this type of product, which is being usurped by flash memory and SSDs. The HDD industry itself is consolidated between three companies: Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Seagate, and Toshiba. The market shares are 45%, 42%, and 13%, respectively. Since the 2011 Thai floods, STX was able to steal away market share as it was not affected as much as others. Prices for HDDs have remained higher than average, leading to gains in gross profit margins and overall profitability. WDC before its recent shareholder meeting on 9/13/12, thought margins would contract soon, but in the meeting WDC released that it was not seeing that margin contraction. This is positive for the HDD industry. WDC also released that it will not compete on a market share basis in its most recent earnings call. The HDD industry hit another positive this year with a record amount of FCF, which is expected to continue to grow.The other 800 pound gorilla in the room is other technology, from smartphones to tablets. Though these devices have cannibalized sales of PCs, they cannot fully replace the market at the current technology. Have you ever tried writing a full length report with a tablet or a smartphone? Good luck! Reports, term papers, and capacity in regards to multi-tasking are clear advantages of PCs. One can type a report with much more ease and speed on a PC. The death of the PC still is not here. That is evidenced by the growth in sales for MacBooks, Toshiba, and Lenovo PCs. The companies being hurt are the former champions of the PC business, namely STX's main customers: HPQ and DELL. HPQ and DELL aren't as flashy, up-to-date, or the social trend in the current world. This may hurt STX though given the percentages of revenue received from them.I happened to be sitting in my MBA class yesterday. I looked around as everyone had their laptops out. You should note the keyword in that last sentence: laptop. Out of the roughly 25 students in that class, only 1 had a tablet. The student did not even use it in class, even though there was a PowerPoint presentation taking place. The brands of laptops were HPQ, Samsung, Dell, and Toshiba. There was only 1 Mac that I could see. This was an unbiased sample that I just happened to notice, and may very well be different than most other classes but something I am willing to take criticism on. Another problem within the PC world that I could see and notice right away was the quality of the PC itself. PCs, though bulky, are quality machines and greatly improved since the 1990s. The rule was that a consumer would have to replace their laptop every 4-5 years, given the new technology and faster speeds of the newer PCs. However, this is not the case. My current Toshiba laptop of over 5 years is still running strong. The only problem I had with it is I had to replace the battery just recently. These machines are not getting replaced as fast as they used to because of what they can still do and the amount of storage capability.HDDs vs. SSDs - ""Gunfight at the O.K Corral"":Obviously, the debate of the fate of PCs comes down to flash memory/SSDs against HDDs. Most other forms of technology run off of flash memory. As noted, this will eat away at the market for PCs but it cannot replace them due to the functionality of the products. Here are some of the differences and truths between HDDs and SSDs:Rise of the Solid State Hybrid DriveDid anyone ever consider in this tech-advanced world, that a company would conceivably combine a SSD with an HDD? STX is the major player in the solid-state hybrid drive (SSHD), which combines a SSD with an HDD. A SSHD integrates a cache to use non-volatile memory or a small SSD, which will increase the speed of the reads and writes. STX has the Momentus XT 7200 RPM 2.5"" drive that incorporates the two drive types. The system boot time was 41% faster than traditional HDDs, while SSDs are only 44% faster. The SSHD also offers decreased power consumption and improved reliability.Clearance SaleThe shopping experience for many is looking at what is on clearance or heavily marked down. The chart below shows the P/E (excluding un-ordinary items), EV/EBITDA, PEG, and P/S for STX, and the S&P 500's P/E (Source: Capital IQ, as of 9/20/12):As shown, the company trades at a discount to itself historically and well-below the S&P 500. That would normally lead one to look at the PEG ratio or expected EPS growth measures. STX is expected to grow about 20% in this fiscal year, driven 66% by buybacks due to its low valuation and large FCF. Management has said that it will reduce shares outstanding to 350M by the end of this calendar year and to 250M by sometime in 2014. The PEG is also well below 1, showing the expected growth to the P/E. Even looking at a non-price metric like EV/EBITDA, STX appears undervalued even to itself!PVGOThe present value of growth opportunities is a metric not commonly used. It tells an investor the expected growth by the market given the stock price currently. The formula is price equals EPS/required rate of return plus the expected growth (P = EPS/r + g). This can be done from a forward standpoint or ttm, with the share price based on a inter-day price of $29.70 on 9/20/12:The PVGO can signal that a company is not going to experience any more growth or that it is undervalued if the PVGO is lower than either peers or 0%. With a negative PVGO as a percentage, STX is clearly undervalued given that the market is expecting growth out of STX already! Clearly, there is value for investors in STX based on PVGO.My Own ValuationAs I've pointed out in many comments on other SA articles, valuations are always wrong and are opinions. For my WACC, I used 11% as it is the expected return of the overall market over the last 10 years on average. It is an unbiased approach and may lead to criticism but it is my opinion on what a discount rate should be about for this kind of company. My valuations consist of various methods, including a DCF, DDM, and Market Multiples. For each of these methods, I use a bear, base, and bull case in order to evaluate the company thoroughly. Within the DCF model, I assumed a 2% growth and increasing COGS as a percentage of revenue. My terminal values for my bear, base, and bull cases were approximately $12.8B, $15.1B, and $17.3B (the market cap is at $11.55B right now and debt is approximately $2.86B). The following chart is what I got for price targets based off of my analysis:Why Should An Investor Own?STX has come back from a high of $35.71 just a few weeks ago. It held its recent shareholder conference on 9/21/12 and will announce earnings in October. In the conference, it noted that revenue will be down slightly compared to previous estimates, but not as bad as analysts had forecasted. It also hinted at another acquisition in the coming year (probably a SSD play as management has said before) by setting aside FCF for such an acquisition. Why do I think you should own it?Disclosure: I am long STX, INTC. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: I am not trying to boost up my own stock return, even though I am long in it. I've already made a strong gain on this position and would look to buy more if it passed below a certain level that I deem acceptable. Thank you."
889001,24663,2012-09-26T06:50:13-04:00,,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is one of the best performing stocks in the market. Over the last year it has increased in value by nearly 200% despite a troubled market and questions surrounding the future demand of hard disk drives (HDDs). The stock is currently trading with a one-month loss of more than 7%, after reaching new highs. However, in the last week it has rallied 6% and was one of the few stocks that traded higher on Tuesday. With that being said, this is a stock that trades in very noticeable trends, and now appears to be trading to new highs. Therefore, as being one of the better performing companies in the market, I am looking at both sides of the trade, and my outlook for the company moving forward.Bear PerspectiveFirst, before jumping into the positives, let's explore the negatives of STX, as with any investment the downside should always be explored. The stock has been downgraded four times in the last five weeks as analysts see weak PC demand hurting the company. The downgrades led to much of the stock's recent loss, but was fueled as well by comments from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) when the company's CEO discussed ""weak enterprise demand."" Analysts believe this weak demand could ultimately affect the high margin server/storage hard drive sales of STX, therefore creating downside in shares of the stock.In addition to analyst downgrades and Intel's bearish outlook, we've also been given negative outlooks from Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell (NYSE:DELL). Most expect the back-to-school and holiday sales of PCs to be weak as a result of macro conditions and increased growth in the tablet space. These problems are accurate and well-documented, but because of Seagate's valuation and its diversified business, in addition to the size of the HDD space, the company should continue to flourish.Bull's PerspectiveMost likely, PC sales will continue to struggle through this holiday season. Of course we will see some level of increased demand but because of our growing interest in tablets consumers with limited expendable income are electing to purchase the new age technology. However, there is more to STX than just PCs, despite the fact that PCs are a necessary piece of equipment in most developed countries and perform tasks that can not be done on tablets.STX does not benefit from the high sales/demand of tablets or smart phones; however, it does benefit from the cloud. HDDs are required for the amount of storage that is connected through the ""cloud"", therefore in a way the growth of smart phones and tablets benefits STX and indirectly creates a new segment of opportunity. In the last month, investors have sold STX due to weak consumer demand. But what investors must have forgotten is that the hard disk drive space is massive and stretches into not only PCs and laptops, but also medical imaging devices, supercomputers, home entertainment, DVRs, game consoles, etc.Two of the fastest growing segments in this space are ""big data"" and the ""cloud"" and there is a major cost advantage for HDDs over solid state disks (SSDs), which are manufactured by companies such as Fusion-IO (NYSE:FIO). The growth of SSDs, flash memory, has also been a point of pessimism for some investors regarding this company. However, Seagate has a very diversified product line of technology that incorporates SSD with HDD and products that give more storage such as SSHD. This particular argument regarding the belief that SSDs will replace HDD somewhat contradicts the arguments made by bears. One of the greatest arguments against STX is that the macro conditions are hurting sales, yet those same people believe SSDs will continue to grow, despite being much more expensive than HDDs, therefore affecting the consumer's wallet in a much more impactful manner.The strategic decisions of Seagate have been on point for the last year, and although I believe the HDD market is more than large enough to return considerable growth I still anticipate Seagate making a bigger splash in the SSD market. OCZ Technology (NASDAQ:OCZ) is an SSD company trading with a pathetic valuation near 52-week lows and a price/sales of 0.66. OCZ is growing very rapid, but can not return to profitability and has horrible operating cash-flow. In my opinion, if STX wants to enter the SDD market then it could very easily acquire OCZ, which has been speculated, and grow its SSD business at a much faster rate than OCZ can do alone. Or it could even partner with OCZ Technology. Either way, the option remains available, and Seagate could easily outbid Micron (NASDAQ:MU) while barely affecting its balance sheet. Micron, on the other hand, would have to count its pennies to go into a bidding war with Seagate, that is if Seagate wishes to acquire OCZ, a move I support and believe will occur considering the valuation of OCZ.ValuationIf you look at the two-year chart below you can see that STX is a trendy stock. It has a tendency to hit new highs and then experience profit taking that lead to a 10-15% pullback. This can be seen on three separate occasions over the last year. The stock then finds some level of support and begins its trend higher. Over the last week the stock has begun to trade higher after finding support in the previous week. The remainder of this week will be crucial in determining its trend over the next six months, but either way, if it falls another 6% or trades higher another 10% I believe it is presenting a large amount of value considering its fundamentals.Seagate is one of the most shareholder-friendly stocks in the market. The company has a plan to reduce the number of its shares outstanding by 250 million by 2014, and it has already bought back over 100 million shares during the last few years. As a result its EPS shows stronger growth, allowing it to easily meet expectations. This may not be fair, but in a market that only cares about top and bottom line performance, STX is usually a golden ticket.Most companies either aggressively buyback shares, or pay a solid dividend, STX does both with its 4.06 yield. Despite the market's recent rally there are many investors who are still seeking yield and safety stocks. Seagate has all the characteristics of a safety stock, that just so happens to be a top performer, with a balance sheet that will allow the company to grow and provide the leverage to adapt to any trends within the market. Take a look at the key fundamental metrics of STX, and you'll see its level of value despite a 200% gain over the last year.ConclusionIt's natural for bears to be out in full force when a stock trends lower, and that's ok. But STX is doing nothing more than continuing its long-term trend with a period of profit-taking, and now looks to be in the process of reversing. Granted, the worries surrounding the company are real and could affect short-term growth. But at this point no other device has been created to fully replace a PC. Tablets are getting more advanced but are still limited, as tablets are still considered a luxury while computers are a necessity. In addition, HDDs are used in many industries and for multiple purposes. I think that in the next year STX will venture out and expand its presence in SSDs but that margins, execution, and keeping shareholders happy will remain its focus. As of now STX is operating in a space in which it can grow to a larger degree. With a modest valuation, a fallen share price, and a stock that is trading higher, I believe it would make a great long-term investment from its current price and return large gains for many years to come.Disclosure: I am long STX.

861751,30951,2012-09-12T03:37:37-04:00,,"Shares of Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), one of the two major players in the hard disk storage space, have performed exceptionally well year-to-date, rising a staggering 83.6%. However, after Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Dell (DELL-OLD), and HP (NYSE:HPQ) confirmed that PC sales in the second half of the year are not expected to recover as had previously been thought, everything in the PC sector got hit pretty badly. Seagate was a casualty of war here, but should investors take this opportunity to get in?Shareholder FriendlinessWhen considering a long term investment, it is critical to consider the shareholder friendliness of the company, especially if the business is mature. Seagate pays a dividend of $1.28/share on an annualized basis or a 4.25% yield as of the most recent closing price of $30.11.In addition to this generous dividend, Seagate has been aggressively buying back shares. In 2008, there were roughly 530M shares outstanding. Today the share count has been reduced to 425M.STX Shares Outstanding data by YChartsSeagate is definitely shareholder friendly.ValuationSeagate is one of the most absurdly cheap technology stocks on the market. Despite an 83% year-to-date run in the stock price, the company is still trading at 4.67x trailing earnings and 4.5x forward earnings. Return on assets is a healthy 20.27% and return on equity is staggeringly high at 96.04%.The company has $2.12B in cash and $2.86B in long term debt, but the debt could be very easily repaid given the firm's healthy profitability and cash flow (the firm generated $1.61B in free cash flow in the trailing twelve months).Compared to its nearest competitor, things get a little more interesting. Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) trades at 6.42x past earnings and 5.09x projected earnings and doesn't pay a dividend. But Western Digital's balance sheet is stronger with $3.12B in cash and only $2.18B in debt. In addition, Western Digital's price to book ratio comes in at 1.32 against Seagate's 3.38. Operating margin for the former is less attractive at 12.92% against the latter's 19.16%.In terms of reducing share count, it seems Seagate has been much more aggressive:STX Shares Outstanding data by YChartsWhile both companies are essentially cash flow machines, I lean towards Seagate for the much better return of cash to shareholders.It's Not Just About PCsWhile hard disk makers are very intimately tied to the consumer PC industry, especially given that hard disk drives have no place in smartphones and tablets, it is important to not lose sight of the fact that the ""cloud"" that enables these portable devices to get away with only having 8-64GB of storage. The cloud will, of course, consist of a whole bunch of hard disk drives.Solid state drives are great and are seeing increasing adoption in the data center/cloud as caching solutions. NAND flash is still too expensive to replace traditional hard disk drives for massive storage and likely will be for the foreseeable future. The nice thing about using caching systems is that you get most of the performance of the fast, small flash solutions while being able to have the massive storage space of traditional hard disk drives.How does this tie into the Intel warning? Well, the company did say that the data center sales were proceeding as expected, which should bode well for both Seagate and Western Digital.ConclusionThe hard disk drive makers are both incredibly cheap and operate in a duopoly. Seagate, in particular, with its strong return of cash to shareholders via buybacks and dividends, is a really attractive stock to own at these levels.Disclosure: I am long INTC.

It should be noted, however, that shorter-term investments in unpredictable businesses are concave in nature. In terms of investments, concavity reflects a scenario where although the expected odds of realized downside are relatively low, the upside is capped, while the full downside potential is comparatively large. An investment in Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is concave in nature, but appears to have very limited downside, given its present valuation and the underlying business dynamics. Let's start with some context on the future of Seagate's product offerings:HDDs: Not Dead YetTo invest in the harddrive space, an understanding of the technologies is vital. HDDs, or hard disk drives, are used in a variety of complex devices. Examples include workstations, supercomputers, enterprise servers, PCs, laptops, medical imaging devices, and home entertainment products. In the past few years, consumers with certain data needs have increasingly trended towards SSDs, or solid state drives.HDDs are, in computer terms, a very old technology. As a result, they are far cheaper, specifically on a price to GB (gigabyte) ratio. For HDDs, the ratio is about $.10 per GB, compared to $.90 per GB for a comparable amount of space provided by a SSD. While the investment community appears to believe that the death of HDDs is imminent, there is a much less exciting dynamic at play. Simply, the cost differential results in very different end-uses.HDDs are still the drive of choice for the following types of users:The Mobile Growth QuestionHDDs have no place in handheld devices, so the natural inclination is to conclude that companies Seagate will lose out on the growth of the cloud. While Seagate won't directly benefit from the trend towards greater usage of mobile devices that use SSDs, the growth story here is a derivative play off of that.Demand for HDD capacity storage is expected to triple over the next ten years. As a leader in client solutions for cloud storage, this growth will have a transformative effect on STX's bottom line.Most importantly, Seagate is developing a precense in the SSD market. Its partnership with DensBits is a move to develop products for everyday users. Additionally, STX's Momentus XT drive was exceptionally well received.The Outlook For Seagate's Bottom Line Is Exceptionally BrightGiven the above factors, what we're left with is an industry that the investment community is misunderstanding. The following is true:On a micro basis, STX's management is executing some very interesting plans.STX plans to reduce the number of shares outstanding to 250 million by 2014. With nearly 400 million shares outstanding today and $2.86 billion of net income, diluted EPS will rise to $11.44 - up from the TTM figure $6.49 - assuming profits stagnate.Some within the investment community may believe that this aggressive share buyback indicates that management is either: (1) trying to inflate earnings, or (2) can't find better places to allocate capital.Neither of these accusations hold much water. I find it highly unlikely that management has been operating a buyback program this large just to meet specific earnings targets or estimates. Additionally, this program has been carried over the past few years, reflecting management's belief that the company is substantially undervalued. A private equity firm tried to take STX private in 2010.As for capital allocation, the company has been investing in its SSD business, improving its HDD offerings, and acquiring talented management like Gary Gentry (former GM of Micron's SSD unit). Furthermore, the company has grown net income by 75% since fiscal 2010 despite stagnant capital expenditures.ConclusionsWhile the HDD business is fairly commoditized, pricing pressures are offset by the duopolistic nature of the industry. Similarly, the recent move towards greater utilization of SSDs is unlikely to be much of a medium-term threat for two reasons. Firstly, Seagate benefits from the general trend of accelerated data creation, since it has an impressive cloud storage/solutions presence. Second, the cost of SSDs and shortage NAND flash (the main component in the chips that SSDs utilize) limit the intermediate-term market potential for SSD manufacturers.This is a company trading at less than 5 times earnings, despite a gigantic catalyst in share buybacks at ultra-cheap values, a strong competitive position, and a 4% dividend.Share repurchases aside, I expect STX's organic earnings to grow at a mid-high, single-digits rate. This reflects the accretive effect from the Samsung HDD purchase, an improved global economy, growth opportunities in cloud solutions and server storage, and new SSD offerings. With only 250 million shares outstanding in 2014, the company should be earning at least $12 per share. Even with zero multiple expansion, STX would be valued at about $60 per share.Admittedly, low valuations have plagued both STX and WDC for quite some time, and this may persist for the next few years. Given the nature of the business (unstable and unpredictable cash flows), I wouldn't value the company at more than ten times earnings, but five is simply far too low, given the internal cash flow generation.By 2014, I expect the market to continue valuing STX with skepticism, but earnings growth and increased distributions will force the stock higher towards the $60-$75 range.I particularly like the asymmetric return profile and margin of safety on this prospective investment. The current valuation implies little or no growth prospects, weak shareholder return, and a dying business. Given economic reality, this is misguided. Short of a collapse in earnings, the stock has exceptionally limited downside, and potential returns that greatly outstrip said downside. Even if my projected 2014 earnings are 30% short and come in closer to $8 per share, shareholders would have received at least 4% annually in dividends, and the stock would still be trading at a dirt cheap multiple.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Founded in 1979, the company has the widest offering of storage drives in the industry, including hard disk drives, solid state drives, and state hybrid drives. SXT gathers its revenues mostly from original-equipment manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE:HPQ), Dell Inc. (NYSE:DELL), and EMC Corp. (EMC).At the time of this writing, STX stock was trading at around $32, with a 52-week range of $9.05 - $35.70. It has a market cap of about $13 billion. The trailing twelve-month P/E ratio is 4.8, whereas the forward one is 3.5. P/B, P/S, and P/CF ratios stand at 3.6, 0.9, and 4.3, respectively. The operating margin is 16% while the net profit margin is 20.8%. With a debt/equity ratio of 0.8, the company obviously has some debt issues. The beta of 2.38 makes STX extremely vulnerable to market changes caused by a supply shock experienced following the Thailand flooding.Seagate Technology has seen fluctuating performance over the last year. This is mostly because of speculation regarding STX acquiring solid state disk manufacturer - OCZ. This fueled the sharp drops and rises in mid-2012. While the company is still on the lookout to acquire SSD makers, the market's optimism is currently more subdued. Furthermore, a sharp drop also occurred at the time that Q2 results were announced, as the company' EPS fell short of the estimated $2.51 expected on Wall Street.STX currently has a 1-star rating from Morningstar. Out of six analysts covering the company, two have a ""buy"" rating, and the other four preferred a ""hold"" rating.Dividend ProfileSeagate Technology pays substantial dividends; the trailing yield is 3.23%, whereas the forward one is 4.14%. Upcoming dividends are expected to amount to $.32 per share. Over the last five years, the company has boosted its dividend amount by 220%. The five-year dividend history proves that Seagate shares an aspiring dividend-growth policy.Competitor performanceCurrently, Seagate's main competitors are SanDisk (SNDK) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).The chart below reflects Seagate's performance relative to industry competitors over the last five years.Notably, Seagate, along with its competitors, has been experiencing problems regarding supplies. However, SanDisk and Western Digital both have been managing to outperform Seagate over the past five years.With a relatively high ttm P/E, SanDisk has experienced a bullish performance on the stock market and become a more attractive buy than Seagate these days. By contrast, Seagate is considerably aggressive in funding its economic growth with debt when compared to its competitors. That is why STX's financial standing might be comparably vulnerable to the possible market decline.Current Economic OutlookSeagate is a kingfish when it comes to manufacturing HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). It has impressive customers such as Hewlett-Packard, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), and Dell. However, many of these manufacturers are now rolling out 'Ultrabooks' which use SSDs (Solid State Drives). Seagate does not have a large foothold in SSD production, which is why it continues to look to acquire an SSD manufacturer. Keeping in mind the slow industry demand and recent downgrading of its stock value, it might be a smart move to enhance its operations in the SSD market.Meanwhile, cash has been reallocated into the company's buyback plan. However, Seagate is still expected to maintain a margin profile well ahead of industry standards. The company bought back $1.1 billion worth of its shares in the last quarter. The entire buyback plan is worth $2.5 billion, spread across the next 2 years, which will reduce Seagate's total number of stocks by 25%. When companies buy back stocks, the total number of outstanding shares is reduced. In turn, this boosts the EPS provided to shareholders. Seagate also has new competitors entering the market, as Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) currently have their own SSD development department. For EXP, it will be a challenge to keep up with and surpass these computer giants.SummaryWhile SSDs are arguably the way of the future, much of the computing world still relies on the dependability and storage benefits of HDDs. Furthermore, SSDs come at a premium price, and average computer users may continue to choose HDDs for their cost-effective performance. For now, Solid State Drives remain a niche market. Furthermore, Seagate has impressive cloud storage, which offers an attractive alternative to the SSDs altogether. Expect STX's earnings to remain moderate for the next year. After evaluating the financial, growth and profitability position of the company, I would recommend to buy Seagate stock, keeping in mind that earnings per share have increased significantly.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

855541,22148,2012-09-09T14:02:15-04:00,,"When Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) reported earnings back on July 30th, it confirmed that the company had completed a massive buyback of 45M shares for $1.25B. The puzzling part is that the company spent over $27 a share for a stock that traded below $10 for a few days back last October. Why load up now?The company is a worldwide leader in hard disk drives and storage solutions.Seagate actually ended the quarter with sequentially higher cash showing that the buyback was at least from cash generated from operations. A good example that the stock was trading considerably below the ability to generate cash if the company bought back 10% of the outstanding stock in one quarter alone.Q4 2012 HighlightsThe company reported the following highlights for Q2:As mentioned above, the most impressive part of the earnings report was the ability to generate a massive $1.4B in cash for the quarter.Net Payout YieldsAs detailed in the September list of top Net Payout Yield (NYSE:NPY) stocks, Seagate made the top ten for the first time due to the strong buyback program. Read the article for more details on the NPY concept. In essence the combined dividend yield and buyback yield provides for a compelling investment in the same way that a high dividend yield is appealing.Seagate though is abnormal in that the high yield usually occurs from a falling stock that juices up a dividend and encourages a higher level of stock buybacks. In this case, the company actually bought stock at higher and higher prices. As can be seen in the below charts, the NPY increased with the stock price. In fact, the company bought the majority of the stock over the last year after it had more than doubled from $10 last October to $20 by February.Net Payout Yield - Seagate TechAs shown above, the company bought over 88M shares for nearly $2B or approximately 19% of the outstanding shares during the first six months of the calendar year.The diluted share count dropped to 427M from 463M last quarter suggesting a substantial drop should occur in the share count for the Q1 2013 earnings report. That reduction could help juice earnings in the next quarter.STX Total Return Price data by YChartsValuationWhile investing based on the NPY theory suggests not even reviewing the fundamentals, those also appear compelling. The stock trades at only 4.5x forward earnings. It also trades at less than 1x sales. Both valuations are very cheap, especially for a company with that ability to generate cash.ConclusionWhile Seagate fits the NPY pattern of operating in an under appreciated sector, hard disk drive storage, the company is at odds with the normal NPY stock. It currently trades near 52-week highs and more than triple the 52-week lows.As an example, Gap (NYSE:GPS) previously ranked in the top ten NPY stocks, but recently dropped off the list after a similar stock run this year. In fact, the stock has surged so much that the company isn't able to generate the cash in order to support a large buyback anymore.The Gap example highlights the beauty of the NPY concept. It typically encourages buying low and selling high. Oddly, Seagate is that one company that violates that conventional wisdom suggesting buying high and selling higher.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in STX over the next 72 hours.

843071,24473,2012-09-03T05:58:35-04:00,,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has enjoyed a slew of bullish analysis from Seeking Alpha contributors in the past couple of months (I, II, III). Although the stock does trade at an exceptionally cheap valuation (forward P/E of 4.65), and has raised its dividend 78% in the past year, there is a major issue bulls are overlooking. The Solid State Drive (SSD) market is rapidly developing into a commoditized business.Seagate saw ridiculous EPS growth from its FY 2011 to FY 2012 (451%, $1.18 vs. $6.50). This has no doubt been the main catalyst for the stock's 185% run in the past 12 months. This growth cannot be sustained, and earnings will have a hard time staying above $5 per share longer than the next 2 years.In Seagate's FY 2012 Q4 (June Quarter), EPS declined from Q3, marking the start of a permanent downward trend. In Q4, Seagate missed analyst estimates by $0.10 (of $2.51) and reported earnings of $2.41, a decline of 8.7% (quarter over quarter). The reason for the miss was the ""industry's faster recovery from the supply chain disruption"" (read the Q4 report here). This faster-than-expected recovery from the Thailand flooding is beginning to cause downward pricing pressure on the entire SSD market already.Seagate's biggest competitor Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) took back market share in Q2 and caused significant pressure on Seagate's margins. Seagate's margins fell from 37% to 33% in the quarter, but remain artificially elevated from pre-flood levels of ~19%. There is still a great deal of room for margins to erode. But don't think that pre-flood levels of 19% are the norm. When the SSD market finally bounces back, both Western Digital and Seagate will experience some of the worst margins in company history. This is due to the commoditized nature of SSDs.SSDs are rapidly becoming more efficient for cheaper, and suppliers are having to charge less for better performing products. This is great news for consumers looking for more storage, but bad news for the companies making SSDs (Seagate and Western Digital).In the FY Q4 conference call, management highlighted the fact that margins will continue to fall (to 30% from 33%) through at least the next quarter. EPS estimates for Seagate's next quarter now stand at $2.03 (down from $2.82 just 90 days ago), a decrease of 15.8% from FY Q4. As future earnings estimates continue to decline, it's becoming clearer that analysts exaggerated the impact of the Thailand flooding, and pricing pressure is unfolding faster than previously anticipated.What makes the situation even more intriguing is the massive insider/institutional selling of late. In the past 6 months, insiders have sold 6.7 million shares, representing about $200 million and 12% of their total holdings. But that's nothing compared to the amount institutions dumped in the past quarter. From Q1-Q2 (Seagate's FY Q3-Q4), institutions reduced their holdings by 46% and sold over 92 million shares. That's good enough for ~$2.5 billion and almost 20% of the entire company.Ironically, as insiders and institutions dump shares, the company has been buying them back at an unprecedented rate. In FY Q4, Seagate bought back $1.2 billion worth of stock, or 45 million shares (representing 86% of cash from operations). Although in the short term this increases the value of the company's common stock, it makes little to no sense.Other than artificially inflating a company's EPS numbers (providing 'shareholder value' is what management says), buying back shares doesn't help Seagate's core business at all. A tech company in an increasingly crowded marketplace (that's losing market share) shouldn't be spending 3.5x as much on share buybacks as on research and development ($1.2 billion vs. $269 million).ConclusionSeagate's massive push to increase shareholder value through dividends and share buybacks makes recent insider/institution actions inexplicable. This comes conveniently timed with a massive (but temporary) spike in earnings, which has been artificially inflated by share repurchases. Something just doesn't add up.The commoditized nature of SSDs is starting to show an impact on Seagate's bottom line (margin drop from 37% to 33% qoq), and the decline in profits is beginning to accelerate faster than expected. After the stock's 185%, 1-year run, I believe shares aren't pricing in the impending decline of SSD prices and the consequentially devastating effect it has on Seagate's future margins.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In addition to being used in desktop and notebook computers, Seagate's products are also used in enterprise servers, mainframes, workstations, DVRs, game consoles, personal data backup systems, portable external storage systems, and digital media systems. The company also provides various data storage services.Seagate has a compelling undervaluation with a trailing P/E ratio of 5.25, a forward P/E ratio of 4.88, and a PEG of 0.16. The stock price has not kept pace with the company's earnings. This is a positive characteristic as the stock will continue to gravitate toward the company's earnings growth.The company has a high profit margin of 19.16% and an operating margin of 20.98%. For the past 12 months, Seagate has pulled in $3.26 billion in operating cash flow and $1.61 billion in free cash flow. The company has 1.87 times more current assets than current liabilities.Although the company missed earnings estimates by 4% in its most recent quarter, it beat estimates for the previous three quarters. The company also had record revenue of $4.5 billion and record shipments of 66 million units for the quarter. This comprised a market share of approximately 42%.Seagate is expected to grow earnings annually at a high rate of 28.28% for the next five years. When you combine the company's generous dividend of 3.8%, investors have the potential to triple the performance of the average S&P 500 company. If this 32% CAGR is realized by reinvesting dividends, a $10,000 investment in Seagate could be worth $40,000 in five years.Seagate currently looks more compelling than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of valuation and growth. Let's take a look at a side-by-side comparison of these two companies.Granted, the two companies are different in terms of the type of technology that they produce. However, when we compare them as potential investments, what matters is a good entry point and the potential earnings growth. When looking at valuation in terms of P/E and PEG ratios, we can see that Seagate presents a much lower valuation than Apple. Since Seagate is operating in the eurozone, the stock has been unfairly suppressed and has not caught up to its earnings growth. Apple also tends to grow earnings at a faster rate than its stock appreciation rate, keeping it undervalued.Seagate's dividends are more than twice as generous as Apple's. With a 3.8% dividend, Seagate's yield is even higher than the SPDR S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NYSEARCA:SDY) average of 3.22%. However, Seagate has not been as consistent as the dividend aristocrats in raising dividends over time. Therefore, the stock should be viewed more as a growth company than a dividend-paying company, in my opinion.Click to enlarge image.It is quite compelling for both Apple and Seagate to be undervalued and also have expected earnings growth above 20%. Some may argue that Apple's expected growth of 22.26% is too low, and that may turn out to be true. If Seagate can achieve its expected annual growth of 28.28%, the stock should continue to perform well. Seagate's stock performance may even surpass Apple's stock performance since it currently has a lower valuation and a higher expected earnings growth rate. Overall, both companies should continue to perform well above average for the next five years. With Apple getting a lot of attention in the investing world, I thought that Seagate also deserves a serious look.Disclosure: I am long AAPL.

812911,25265,2012-08-16T17:19:03-04:00,,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has strung together several solid quarters in a row now. The flooding in Thailand during the 2011 monsoon season, which temporarily and significantly affected global hard disk drive (HDD) supply, has actually led to the highest gross margins in recent years, if not ever, for this industry. Seagate came out of the floods positioned extremely well. Some of their suppliers experienced stoppages in production, but Seagate was still able to post record results in the March and June 2012 quarters as pricing rebounded and they took market share from competitors (they also purchased Samsung's HDD business in December 2011, which added to results).While the FCF growth is impressive, gross margins have almost certainly peaked. Still, they should remain well above the previous normal range of 18 - 20 percent due to tighter supply, growing demand, and industry consolidation. Management has said they expect gross margins to be at least 30 percent for the remainder of the calendar year 2012. With their focus on selling higher margin products, Seagate should meet their margin goals for the next few quarters.So what has Seagate been doing with all that cash it generates? In a word (or two): a lot. They have been buying back stock (a ton of it), paying down debt (current net debt is only $1.1B, which is less than last quarter's FCF), paying dividends and making acquisitions (they purchased Samsung's HDD business, for which they paid half the purchase price in cash, the remainder in stock).And yet the stock still trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 5.4x and even lower on a forward basis. This after a 50%+ run-up in the stock price since early June. Of course technology hardware companies like Seagate historically trade at high single digit multiples, but a Company executing as well as Seagate should trade at the upper-end of that historical range in my opinion, especially when it has a 3.7% dividend, which is only an 10-12% FCF payout ratio.So what is the Board doing to help get the stock to a respectable P/E multiple? First, they raised the dividend for the second time in a year last month, to an annualized $1.28/share (3.7% yield based on the current stock price). Second, they will continue to repurchase shares, boosting EPS significantly. Over the past two quarters alone, the Company has repurchased $2.2B of shares. At June 30, that was nearly 20 percent of the Company! In six months!Management has stated their intention to end calendar year 2012 with a basic share count of 350M shares (basic weighted average share count at June 30 was 411M). They also recently introduced their intention to get the basic share count down to 250M shares by calendar year-end 2014. That would be a massive reduction in share count and would serve to maintain or expand diluted EPS even if margins deteriorate more than anticipated.Additionally, management recently stated that they are indeed looking for acquisitions in the solid state drive (SSD) space, particularly in the enterprise space. OCZ Technology was rumored in late July to have sold itself to Seagate, however that rumor has so far turned out to be false. And just this morning IBM agreed to purchase Texas Memory Systems, an enterprise storage technology provider. IBM's purchase might just be the one that sets off a wave of consolidation in the SSD space. While Seagate already builds and sells HDDs and SSDs (as well as hybrid drives), they can certainly benefit from aggregating additional capacity under their umbrella. Synergies amongst two companies combining forces (particularly with one having the size and scope of Seagate) will help offset the lower margins that the pure play SSD makers have.So where does this leave Seagate shareholders? By most reasonable valuation metrics, Seagate is undervalued. It generates a ton of free cash flow. If a private equity shop believes that Seagate can continue to generate $3-$4B in FCF a year, it is a no brainer leverage buyout at these valuation levels. They can pay about 7-8x EPS, giving existing shareholders a nice return (even after the recent run-up), and still generate a solid return themselves. We know Seagate and Chairman/CEO Steve Luczo has taken Seagate private once before in an attempt to unlock shareholder value, back in 2000. We also know that Seagate was rumored to have participated in failed talks to again take the company private in 2010. Today, the Company is performing better than ever. Cash flow is extremely strong, giving the Company many options for its uses. If they continue to buy back shares at the pace they are currently, one of two things will happen. The stock will either soar to $50+ per share or the Company will get bought out in a LBO transaction. Either one will be a win for shareholders.Disclosure: I am long STX."
787581,30951,2012-08-07T15:42:12-04:00,,"It's no secret that solid state drives are poised to be the dominant storage technology going forward. Compared with traditional hard disk drives, solid state drives offer lower latency and access times, are less vulnerable to physical shock, consume less power, and are silent. The primary disadvantage is that the cost per gigabyte for solid state storage is significantly less attractive. To illustrate, for the price of a 512GB solid state drive (roughly $360 for the least expensive model on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at time of writing), one could instead purchase three 2TB 7200 RPM hard disk drives.While I expect the prices of solid state drives to drift down as NAND flash prices steadily drop, the reality is that at least in the near to medium term, hard disk drives as well as flash technology will co-exist to serve the broad needs of the market.Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), one of the two major players in the hard disk drive realm, is a strong company today, exhibiting stellar sales and earnings from the traditional hard disk drive business (for a more in-depth view on this, I recommend Skyler Greene's ""Seagate Earnings Strong, Stock Has 80% Upside"").Unfortunately, concerns over the future of hard disk drives in the face of solid state technology are very likely the reason for the incredibly low price-to-earnings of 4.94 as of last close. I believe, however, that Seagate's management team has positioned the company to be able to transition to solid state drive technology for the following reasons:1. The Samsung PartnershipBy far, the most expensive part of a solid state drive is the NAND flash, so the ability to procure NAND at good prices is imperative to success in the field. To this end, Seagate partnered with Samsung, a leading manufacturer of NAND flash, to ensure a supply of NAND flash for pure solid state drives and hybrid drives going forward. Seagate's size and purchasing scale will allow it to produce cost-competitive products with good margins going forward.At the most recent conference call, it was noted that the technology partnership with Samsung was proving fruitful and that test products of the ""highly competitive tier 0 product"" would be shipping to customers at the end of the current quarter.2. The DensBits StakeThe next piece of the solid state puzzle is the controller technology. Seagate recently took an equity stake in the company DensBits. In the most recent conference call, it was noted that the company is developing solid state drive controller technology with DensBits, indicating the company's continued commitment to position itself well in the flash space going forward.3. Openness To Further AcquisitionsWhile it is clear that Seagate's cash and partnerships will allow it to prosper in the flash storage market going forward, the company is keenly aware that it needs not to simply be ""competitive,"" but it needs to eventually dominate in a space with a number of highly competitive players including Violin Memory, SanDisk (SNDK), Fusion-IO (NYSE:FIO), STEC (NASDAQ:STEC), OCZ Technology Group (NASDAQ:OCZ), and a slew of others. I expect Seagate to use its enormous profitability to further build its moat going forward and acquire companies and technologies that will strengthen its competitive position.ConclusionIn short, the company's future prospects are excellent, and despite the apparent resistance to flash storage technologies that the company has exhibited in the past, it is clear that management is well positioned for the future of storage. Coupled with a healthy, growing dividend, and a rock solid balance sheet, it's hard to not recommend initiating (or adding to) a position in Seagate.Disclosure: I am long OCZ.Additional disclosure: I may initiate a long position in STX within the next 24 hours."

Let us re-evaluate Seagate.Earnings ContrastOn July 30 2012, Seagate announced its Q4 2012 earnings, and the stock recovered from an almost 8% intraday decline to close only about 1.3% below its previous close.Seagate's earnings were in complete contrast with Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) earnings call. Western Digital provided a better EPS guidance for the next quarter, while Seagate reported revenue and profit that missed expectations and worse, offered a lower-than-expected outlook for its next quarter, expecting revenues to decline about 10%. Seagate also issued a warning about near-term PC demand.Red FlagsSeagate's story is mostly all about the hard disk drive market. On the positive side, Seagate will enjoy higher HDD pricing for the next few quarters. According to a recent IHS iSupply's Memory & Storage Market Brief report, the average selling prices or ASPs will continue to remain high, possibly until 2014, as the industry recovers from the Thailand floods.But there are some major red flags. Seagate reported that the demand for PCs and specifically hard disk drive is softening. According to Seagate, the industry is recovering overall faster than expected, which also means more competition than expected for Seagate, translating to market share pressures.Conclusion and Next StepsSeagate has expressed optimism for the 2012 year-end and has signaled stock buybacks as well. In such situations, it is tough for investors to let go of the stock. Nevertheless, after perusing the company's earnings call transcript, I am a bit disconcerted by its demand outlook.Thanks to Mario Draghi's comments about saving the euro at any cost, the market volatility related to the eurozone mess has subsided a bit. Additionally, the market had some reason to cheer, with the ISM data coming out neutral-to-positive, the construction data showing increased activity, and most importantly, jobs data pleasantly surprising all by an increase in non-farm payrolls. All these factors could possibly extend the mini-rally we saw on Friday, unless some other economic indicators show opposite trends or bad news suddenly pops out of Europe or China.I think it is time to start shedding shares of Seagate and book profits, and once again wait for a broader market pullback to re-enter. It is very possible that Seagate could climb to the $32-$35 range if this positivity continues for a couple of weeks, but the 8% drop on its earnings day raises a red flag about what is coming when the market volatility spikes. The risk-reward at this price is not too appealing to hold onto and one should start booking some profits.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Notable information: the quarterly dividend payout was raised 28% from $0.25 to $0.32, revenue expectations for the September quarter are $4.0B, and gross margin expectation for the September quarter is ~30%. The yearly dividend of $1.28 represents a 4.57% payout on the current trading price of ~$28.I view the dip as a buying opportunity. Why? According to a July 27 report by Thomson Reuters, analyst estimates for 2013 full year profits range from a low of $6.05 to a high of $9.48 with a mean of $7.92. These estimates all still seem very reasonable after earnings, with CEO Steve Luczo guiding for non-GAAP EPS of $8.44 for FY13 in the earnings conference call. The following table presents end-of-FY-2013 stock price depending on the TTM P/E ratio at that time.Presented in the table below are the same price targets converted into percentage return format, assuming a cost basis of $30/share.Given STX's current and historical TTM P/E (see chart below), all of these ratios are reasonable. Even assuming the most conservative TTM multiple (5) and the mean analyst consensus, the stock could return 32% excluding the dividend. With a higher multiple and earnings ahead of analyst consensus, the return could vault into the triple digits. It's worth noting that according to Thomson Reuters, the current mean analyst consensus of $7.92 EPS for FY 2013 has fallen from $9.43 as of 90 days ago. Based on Luczo's guidance of $8.44 and a TTM P/E of 6, I believe $50.64 is a reasonable 1-year price target, representing 80% upside to the current after-hours share price of $28.00. Even if Seagate falls short of this guidance, the stock should continue to display strength as problems related to Thai flooding continue to recede.Watch for Seagate to devote more attention to the SSD sector, where it's been pretty busy lately. After investing in Israel-based DensBits, the company has stolen Gary Gentry from Micron Technology (MU) to lead Seagate's SSD efforts.Disclosure: I am long STX."
773801,32101,2012-08-02T10:49:38-04:00,,"Pre-Flood verse Post-Flood SeagateFrom the standpoint of Seagate's (NASDAQ:STX) year old 10-K, the company is not too impressive. Before the floods in Thailand gave Seagate a new position in the disc drive world, their industry was at the low point of the product cycle, profit margins were slim and cash flow was weak year-over-year. But with the record results released Monday night, Thailand's flooding has allowed Seagate to achieve a new operating level; the value of which, it appears, has not been taken into account by the markets. First, let's look at the challenges facing the disc drive industry generally.The IndustryThe hard disc drive business is notoriously hard. In fact, in the classic, ""The Innovators Dilemma,"" Clay Christensen studies the evolution of industries by studying the early disc drive industry specifically. He chose the disc drive industry because of its rapid transformation, evidenced by the rise and fall of companies from the late 70's through the 90's. Studying the rapid rise and fall of companies was, to Professor Christensen, like the geneticists studying fruit flies for their rapid birth and death.One problem facing the disc drive industry is price erosion. Their products ""commodify"" shortly after each new product release. That is, their gross margins on new products decline after their introduction (over 2 or 3 quarters according to Seagate CEO Steve Luczo). The key sign of a ""commodified"" product is increasing unit volumes with decreasing price per unit. Case and point, Seagate's (Pre-Flood) 2011 10-K, p. 54:While Seagate's products face tough economics, the market for disc drives grew 4% from July 2010 to July 2011 and would have grown further in July 2011 to July 2012 if it wasn't for the flooding in Thailand. From 2010 to 2011, storage demand by gigabytes increased 34%. (No numbers were available for this past fiscal year, but chances are the pattern was similar.)For investment, it is unappealing that Seagate's products face persistent price erosion. But, having said that, this is not a negative analysis.Post Thai Flood: 29% to 42% Market ShareWhile the Thailand flooding last year put some headwinds on hard disc manufactures, PC OEMs, and other manufactures in need of hard disc drives, Seagate made it out good.Seagate, according to iSuppli, went from having a 29% market share in Q3 2011 to a 38% market share immediately following the flood in Q4. Having shipped 50 million hard discs in Q3 2011 before the flooding, it shipped a record 66 million in the most recent quarter (Q1 2012), for a market share of approximately 42%.Seagate has closed the gap with market leader Wester Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), who has market share of 44%. Seagate gained substantial windfall from the disaster and posted a 40% increase in revenue as of July 2012. But with Seagate's earnings release two nights ago, we witness the folly of the financial markets. After achieving record revenue, record net income and record operating cash flow, the shares were down 8% in aftermarket trading and further the following day.Seagate's Results and Share Buy BacksSeagate, as noted above, increased revenue by 40% year-over-year and had net income of $2.9 billion, representing a ROE of 117%. If it were not for share buybacks, book value would have more than doubled. Their share buy backs were substantial as management made clear in the conference call (transcript):And in their press release:These share repurchases were partially to offset the shares issued during their acquisition of Samsung's disc drive division at the end of last year, so saying that the shares they purchased represents 19% of the companies market capitalization is a little misleading. Nevertheless, they had a diluted share count of 467 million last July and now have a diluted share count of 427 million, or a reduction of 9%. But more interestingly, they further said in the conference call:Share Buy Backs and Future EarningsSince we all know that:(*It's a bit more complicated than this because of dilutive securities, but that doesn't matter here.)Let us hypothesize that next years earnings will equal this past years record earnings, to better understand the potential effects of these share buy backs. On that assumption, we see that Seagate's net income, with 350 million shares outstanding will be about $8.28 a share.Or:(**This won't match the numbers released on Monday because of the way ""average diluted shares"" is calculated. Fortunately, this is just an exercise.)Therefore, with a present P/E of 4.65, and no change in either net income or share price, their P/E next fiscal year would be 3.65:(**Diluted, as released)In this case, no change in share price would make the shares appear even cheaper because of the buy backs.Or, differently, if they retained their P/E of 4.46 over the period of share reduction, mathematically speaking, their price would increase to $38.50, or about a 27% return from today's prices.(**Diluted, as released)Notice that is assuming either (i) no change in share price, or (ii) no change in P/E valuation. Both of which are incredibly unlikely and we will probably see a higher valuation--a higher share price--in the future, barring any unforeseen cataclysm. And that is what we are looking for.Of course, the problem is whether they will maintain their earning power--a problem with the industry as a whole, mentioned at the start.Market Leader and CustomersWith Seagate's new market leader position and technology leadership, status quo bias suggests they can maintain their new position. In addition, 69% of 2011 revenue was from large OEM's like Dell (DELL-OLD) (13%) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) (15%) whose business is steadier (I argue) than that of the consumer business which makes up 9% to 31% of revenue.Also, because they are also leading in the introduction of new products, they are likely to have higher gross margins in the near term. Of course, those margins will erode overtime as supply catches up with demand (see p. 50 - 51 of 2011 10-K on the effects of industry supply and demand imbalances).Seagate's position, then, will not look as strong a year from now simply due to their product cycles and their competitors reestablishing themselves. In fact, one can see the wave of the two-year disc drive product cycles below in the cash from operations line:(Click to enlarge)STX Revenue TTM data by YChartsAll this implies that we are likely on a peak of earnings which will probably last through the Window's 8 release. This should cause us to use caution when accepting the valuations based on present earnings above. But today, the future is different than the past. They captured more market share after the flood. Therefore, the troughs in TTM operating cash flow will likely be shallower in the future.ConclusionSeagate is undervalued and the market's reaction on Monday and Tuesday was arbitrary.To conclude, I leave you with a notable quote from Monday's conference call about Seagate's new hybrid drives.(Please post disagreements or counter-facts in the comments section below -- that way I can either address them or learn something new.)Disclosure: I am long STX."

761061,27151,2012-07-30T06:09:27-04:00,,"The premise of this article was originally supposed to compare the very attractive Returns on Equity (ROE) by both Apple, Inc. (AAPL) and Seagate Technology PLC (STX); however I actually found that STX is a much more attractive stock than AAPL based on several comparable variables. The initial requirements for my screen were as follows:-Minimum Return On Equity Must Be 44.00%-Minimum P/E Ratio Must Be Under 14.00-Minimum Yield Must Be 1.00%After what many analysts are calling a dismal second quarter for some of the major companies within the sector, I wanted to focus on two companies that either met or surpassed the minimum requirements I had established, with the focal point being Return on Equity (ROE). The term 'Return on Equity' is defined as ""the amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders equity. Return on equity measures a corporation's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested"". In my opinion, the screen of companies based on ROE acts a stepping stone for beginning investor.Apple, Inc. trades in a 52-week range of $353.02 (52-week low) and $644.00 (52-week high), closed trading at $585.16/share on Friday. For the June quarter analysts were expecting AAPL to earn $10.37/share, but when the company announced earnings of $9.32/share on Tuesday, the stock took an after-hours beating. That said there are several reasons I'm attracted to AAPL, especially at the $585.00/share level. First, the company has demonstrated a 44.32% return on equity over the last 12 months, which to me is exceptional considering the slowdown in Europe due to the ongoing economic crisis. Second, and from an income standpoint, the company recently announced it would be distributing its first dividend in almost 17 years. Even though the yield is only 1.8% ($10.60), I think investors could see a continued increase in the dividend based on the company's ability to accumulate and stockpile cash over the next several years.Potential investors looking to establish a position in AAPL should consider the company's recent acquisition, which in my opinion, will help fuel the performance of the company's stock during the second half 2012 and first half of 2013. The company recently announced the acquisition of AuthenTec for $356 million dollars in an effort to boost its presence in the mobile and user initiated computer security segments. The company currently owns over 200 patents with regard to fingerprint sensors and various other end user sensor technologies, which would certainly enhance not only Apple's presence with the sector, but enhance their bottom line with various new revenue streams.Seagate Technology PLC trades in a 52-week range of $9.05 (52-week low) and $32.55 (52-week high), closed trading at $30.01/share on Friday. Based on the company's recent performance over the last month, up nearly 21.35%, there are three reasons why I like STX. First and foremost, the company has demonstrated a return on equity of 63.89% over the last twelve months and when compared to some of its competitors, STX's ROE is nearly 2.60 times that of Western Digital's (WDC) ROE which is 24.50%, and nearly 4.65 times that of EMC Corp. (EMC) which has demonstrated an ROE of 13.76%. The second variable to consider ahead of July 30th earnings, is the company's recent EPS trends. In all four of the last quarters STX has surpassed analysts' estimates by an average of 17.25%. If we compare that to the EPS trends of EMC we'll notice that estimates were surpassed in two of the last four quarters by an average of just 4.65%.Potential investors should try and establish a position ahead of the company's earnings which are set to be announced after the bell on Monday July 30th. When it comes to STX, the company's EPS performance over the last four quarters clearly speaks for itself, but there are two things investors should pay close attention to. STX is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland and given the current economic state of the Eurozone, it will be interesting to see how the company will fare in terms of sales and revenue growth. If something compelling comes out of the report, such as higher than expected sales growth or an improved outlook for the second half of 2012, we could see the stock pop by at least 4%. If earnings come in-line or fall short based on secondary catalysts such a slowdown in the US PC market we could see the stock sell-off as much as 3%-5%, although the chances of that happening are pretty slim.Final AnalysisNot only do AAPL and STX meet the minimum requirements set forth in the screen, but when compared from both an income and growth standpoint, STX comes out the surprising winner. AAPL's dividend yield of 1.8% ($10.60) and STX's dividend yield of 3.3% ($1.00) may be considered a bit conservative; however I believe they open the door for income investors who may be interested in establishing a position in the tech sector from an income angle. On the other hand, and from a growth standpoint, STX is the clear leader, considering the company is expected to grow 796.40% during the June quarter and 608.80% during the September quarter, which is 28.18 times that of Apple. If we combine the growth potential of STX with the current yield of 3.3% and a P/E ratio of 6.78 not only do we have a very inexpensive stock, but one that is certainly demonstrating excellent long-term potential. Do I think STX is outshining AAPL from a fundamental standpoint? Based on my calculations and research, I certainly do.Disclosure: I am long STX, AAPL."
768511,25258,2012-08-01T06:04:06-04:00,,"Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX) released its quarterly earnings on July 30 and was immediately met with a knee-jerk reaction by investors as the company reported net earnings 5% lower than analysts were expecting. The company stated it had diluted earnings per share of $2.37 compared to the $2.51 analysts were expecting. In the immediate aftermath, shares traded down 9% in after-hours trading in a clear reflection of the volatility suffered by the company.Yet by the close of Tuesday, July 31, the company was only down 1.35% as the stock rallied back up to $30.02. Over the course of the day, the stock rallied from its open of $27.91 and even went into positive territory for a short time period. Much of the enthusiasm could be found over comments made in the conference call following the earnings release. The transcript of the earnings call can be found here.The most encouraging news could be found in the company's guidance on its share buyback and dividend policy. Seagate's CEO Steve Luczo stated the following:The current number of shares outstanding stands at 411 million as of June 2012 according to the company's recently released earnings. With expectations to reduce the share count to 350 million over the next 5 months, this immediate buyback would suggest that the company is willing to spend $1.83 billion at current market prices! Were the market capitalization of the company to stay at roughly $12.3 billion (as of July 31, 2012), the reduced share count would present a new share price of approximately $35 by the year's end. Factor in the increased dividend guidance, and it appears that Seagate may be in for a near-term bump up in value.One interesting note concerning the earnings call is the lack of the company's mention of any possible acquisitions on the table. Most recently, Seagate had been rumored to be interested in buying out OCZ Technology Group (NASDAQ:OCZ). The rumor had also suggested that Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) was another interested bidder that could be competing for the acquisition. Yet despite the plausible story backing the industry rumor, the earnings call is likely to have put to rest any further speculation concerning an OCZ buyout. With the hefty amounts of cash needed to buy back the company's shares and increase the dividend, it would seem unlikely that Seagate would be interested in spending heavily on another acquisition that could run up to several hundred million dollars.Apart from the slight earnings miss that was largely due to a now-resolved supplier issue, Seagate's earnings call was a very encouraging overview of the company and its intentions. The stated ambition to significantly return value to shareholders on both the fronts of an increased dividend and reduced share count should not be taken lightly by current investors. As the company trades with a current enterprise multiple of 4.49. However, it appears as if investors continue to discount the ongoing earning potential of the company.Seagate has very little room left for acquisitions in the hard drive market space as the company forms a practical oligopoly with its largest peers found in Western Digital Corp (WDC) and Toshiba Corp (TOSBF.pk). With limited competition allowing for increased pricing power and advances being made on the technological front through hybrid drives and solid state drives, Seagate is now ready to focus on returning value to investors. Cash that is pouring into the company is already being redirected towards share buybacks and increased dividends. It remains a wonder as to why investors fail to see the value here.Disclosure: I am long STX, MU."

739351,21151,2012-07-23T08:23:37-04:00,,"For those who follow my dividend holdings, you probably noticed that I have sold ZWB and bought STX not so long ago. I've already shared my disappointment in ZWB and decided to move on quickly. When I sold ZWB, I was down by about 12% (loss of $251.38 after dividend payments). STX is almost getting this loss back after 6 weeks since the trade (I'm currently +$235 at the moment of writing this post). I wasn't expecting to make a quick profit on this stock as I think I can get a lot more with Seagate Technology. Let me tell you how.Seagate Technology is the largest hard disk manufacturer with 35% in market share. Their range of production goes from desktop to laptop and from servers to workstations. STX has great expertise in storage data and includes backup system services and digital video recorders (DVRs). It is also present in online backup services. STX surely has a lot of competitors in this industry. The most important are Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Hitachi, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) and SanDisk (SNDK).Seagate's financial metrics are quite interesting. The dividend yield and dividend growth are pretty strong. Most of the dividend growth comes from the past 12 months when STX has adopted an aggressive dividend increase paired with a $2,5G stock repurchase plan. With such a low P/E ratio (6.15) and forward P/E ratio (around 2.9), we understand why STX is more interested in purchasing its own stocks. The company's payout ratio is also quite reasonable and provides room for dividend increases in the future. The debt to capital ratio is quite low as well. Definitely, the present situation of the company looks good.STX is trading on an uptrend.While the current financial metrics around Seagate look great, the future is uncertain. There is a reason why the P/E ratio is so low; some investors believe in the death of the PC. The main problem for STX is similar to Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC). Both companies are leaders in their industry (hard drives and processors) but they are both directly related to PCs. Mobiles and tablets are lurking towards flash memory to store their data. The difference between hard drives and flash is huge. Hard drives include mechanical parts, use more power and flash drives are also less likely to break. On the other hand, flash memory is not as powerful as hard drives and is costly. So far, hard drives are also faster than flash technology. Unfortunately, you can bet that as technology advances, these disadvantages will disappear to the profit of a strong and faster flash drives. This is how Flash memory could eventually replace hard drives.STX recently decreased its forecast for Q4 2012 in a similar way that Intel did after releasing strong results last week. However, both stocks rose on the day. This shows that the market knows about upcoming dangers but still believes that computer-related companies are strong enough to evolve at the same speed as technology does. STX has made a few recent acquisitions in order to boost its cloud computing division. This is another growing market to develop.Final Thoughts on Seagate TechnologyI've bought STX for a few reasons. The first one was the low P/E ratio paired with a solid balance sheet. The company has a lot of cash to make acquisitions and develop other technologies in order to face flash memory future domination. I also believe that if STX continues to post strong results as it did in the last 18 months or so, investors will increase the P/E multiple for this company. I don't expect a P/E ratio of 15 but I'm pretty sure it can reach 8-9. This would add a nice percentage to my investment return. In the meantime, the company is doing well presently and paying a strong dividend. This is enough to keep me waiting for a while.The bet on STX is simple; I think the company will continue to sell hard drives and that it is strong enough to evolve over time. On top of that there are 24 analysts following the stock and their average growth forecast is 30%. Not bad for a ""supposedly dying"" company?Disclosure: I'm long STX and sold my positions in ZWB a month ago."

Even if you don't want to go long the stock, options present an interesting opportunity for interested traders.Seagate reports earnings on July 30, but I don't believe the stock has a whole lot of downside post-earnings. Why? Well, Seagate already pre-announced rough estimates of revenue and margin for the quarter. The company expects to report record unit shipments, but lowered revenue due to a one-time supplier quality issue. The stock dropped immediately after the announcement, but has been on an uptrend ever since. It seems investors don't view Seagate's current quarter in a bad light.Despite this fact, August-expiry options are trading at a premium. $22 puts can be written for a 21-cent premium, $23 puts can be written for a 37-cent premium, $24 puts can be written for a 62-cent premium, and $25 puts can be written for a 92-cent premium. These premiums represent very solid yields of between 1% and 3.7% for a mere 3 weeks..

The $22 strike represents a discount of approximately 15% to current trading prices, and such a strong downside move is highly unlikely given the circumstances. Even in the improbable event that such a move does occur, you could do much worse than picking up Seagate shares at current valuations.Disclosure: I am long STX."
695911,31471,2012-07-02T06:54:51-04:00,,"I recently picked up shares of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) on the dip. In Seagate Set To Shine, I analyzed the fundamental thesis for investing in the stock: dirt-cheap valuation, strong growth, and an awesome dividend.The reason Seagate is trading at such a cheap P/E multiple is that many investors view it as another ""old tech"" company. After all, in today's era of tablets and mobile computing, who wants a hard drive?That argument is flawed, as I examined in Dell: Old Tech Giant With 30% Upside. While the sales numbers for personal computers (and consequently hard drives) may no doubt decrease as ""mobile"" computing becomes the norm, the rise of cloud computing inherently necessitates better (and more) data storage. Many ""old tech"" companies have quietly been prepping this infrastructure while the ""new tech"" companies get all the attention with the flashy tablets. But remember, without data storage, the cloud computing that these tablets rely on won't work. Companies investing in the infrastructure will see rewards, and Seagate got serious about this last year with their Pulsar SSD line of data storage drives. As explained by Kurt Richarz, Seagate's EVP of Product Line Management:New DevelopmentsTwo new developments spell success for Seagate.The first is Seagate's recent inclusion in the S&P 500. Due to an acquisition of Progress Energy by Duke Energy, a spot was open, and that spot was given to Seagate. Shares of Seagate jumped on the news. Why? The fundamentals of the company obviously didn't change overnight. The answer is psychological: being included in a prestigious index like the S&P 500 is somewhat akin to being nominated for an Academy Award -- it's ""recognition"" of your status. Many people who focus exclusively or primarily on ""big-index"" stocks (Dow, Nasdaq, S&P) will now be giving Seagate a closer look. Seagate may also experience a short-term boost as it is bought up by the various index funds like SPY that track the performance of the index.The second development is Seagate's acquisition of DensBits Technologies. The one area where Seagate has been lagging behind its sole major competitor WesternDigital is in the consumer Solid State Drive sector. (While Seagate's Pulsar is based on SSD technology, the Pulsar is designed for commercial data servers -- not consumer computers.) The acquisition of DensBits will help Seagate continue to develop low-cost technology in both consumer and enterprise SSDs. One of the reasons Seagate acquired DensBits was for their controller technology:ConclusionSeagate is very attractively valued right now, especially given their potential for explosive growth. They've caught the attention of well--regarded hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who owns over 5.4% of the company's shares.

701821,32241,2012-07-04T12:04:55-04:00,,"Seagate TechnologyI've developed a screen for value-based stocks with a strong, growing dividend for income. Following this screen, I've decided to take a closer look at Seagate Technology (STX). The screen itself consists of:Company Overview:Seagate is a leading provider of both hard drives and storage solutions. Offering a broad portfolio of hard disk drives, solid state drives, and solid-state hybrid drives, Seagate is the world's foremost producer of hard disk drives based on revenues. Seagate produces disk drives targeting: A) enterprise applications, where its products are used for enterprise servers and mainframes; B) client compute applications, focusing on desktops and notebooks; C) client non-compute applications targeting DVRs, personal data backup systems, and portable external storage systems. Seagate also provides data storage services for small and medium sized businesses. Seagate derives most of its revenue from its Client Compute defined units, at 72% of revenues in fiscal Q3 2012.Upcoming Events:Computer Hardware Industry and Seagate:The electronic data storage industry can be broken up into the following supply chain:Major subcomponent manufacturers, who manufacture subcomponents for -> hardware storage manufacturers such as Seagate, who develop hardware components (IE: HDD or SSD storage devices) for -> end users or companies who create products such as PC's, collecting, processing, or otherwise combining the storage components to fit their needs.Thus, Seagate is dependent upon the PC and storage markets for its demand for its products and subcomponent manufacturers for supply. Seagate has a longstanding relationship with many customers such as HP, Dell, and EMC.The PC market has recently been roiled by flooding in Thailand, which affected the supply chain and diminished supply, specifically of hard disk drives. However, much of the supply chain has been restored at this point.In terms of growth and hard drive demand, tablets have become household items and laptops continue to lead desktops (with portable computers accounting for 59% of PC shipments in 2011). PC growth was strong at 13.7% in 2010, but lagged in 2011 at only 1.6%. The Asia/Pacific market is the world's largest regional market for PCs, with 1/3 of the world's unit shipments in 2011. Focusing on desktops, the IDC Worldwide PC Forecast Update forecasts a slow growth rate of .2%, while portables should grow at 9% and tablets a phenomenal 38.6%. It is important to note that tablets, smart phones, and similar smaller devices all primarily use SSD, while desk tops and those demanding larger storage capacities will still utilize HDD.On the other hand, the server market consists of tough pricing competition with some growth while facing lessening economic growth conditions. After consecutive growth quarters following the market downturn in 2009, revenue fell in the fourth quarter of 2011. Looking forward, the need to improve outdated systems (that perhaps were not updated due to the downturn in 2009), fulfill cloud computing, and store data and develop data centers should fuel demand for servers. A more recent trend of ""virtualization"", in which servers are upgraded via a software application to split the server into multiple operating systems for more capacity and efficiency may dampen demand for new systems entirely. Companies have been packaging their servers, IE: developing server systems and also attempting to tell software and related support for those servers all in one.In fiscal year 2011, the total available market for hard disk drives was approximately 657 million units, representing a 4% increase from 2010; overall storage demand increased approximately 40% year over year.Positives:The company's valuation ratios are very low. Seagate currently trades at a P/E of 5.69 and an extremely low PEG of .16. Competitors Western Digital Corp (WDC), Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF), and Hitachi (OTCPK:HTHIY), sport P/Es of 7.0, 3.0, and 22.7 respectively. Seagate's Price/ Sales is .81 while Western Digital's is .72 and Toshiba's is .04. Seagate's Price/ Cash Flow is 3.91, slightly lower than the 4.42 of Western Digital and 4.14 of Hitachi. Seagate has delivered some growth post 2009, posting 65.12% revenue growth quarter over quarter for the last quarter ended March 31st. EPS growth quarter over quarter for the same period is an astounding +1,081%.In terms of returns, Seagate has posted a 31.73% return on investment TTM, well above Western Digital's 14.60%. Similarly, its return on assets is 21.17% TTM, twice WDC's 10.54%. It also has a high inventory turnover ratio, at 12.38x for the most recent quarter and 9.27x for the most recent fiscal year.Seagate recently completed the acquisition of Samsung Electrons Co.'s HDD business; the company expects to improve its position as a supplier in markets including mobile computing, cloud computing and solid state storage, and expand customer access in China and Southeast Asia.Neutral:Seagate Technology announced in April 2012 that it has been authorized to repurchase up to $2.5 billion shares, reaching a total authorized capacity for approximately $3.5 billion shares. However, it is my belief that much of this has already been 'priced in'. This is also in response to Seagate distributing authorized but unissued shares to Samsung shareholders as a result of its acquisition; at the time, Seagate diluted outstanding shares by 10%.Negatives:It is important to understand that Seagate engages primarily in HDD production. Disk drive competition is extremely competitive, as manufacturers compete for a limited number of major disk drive customers and also compete with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide alternative solutions such as SSD or flash memory. Seagate's principal competitors include Western Digital Corporation, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, and Toshiba. For hard drives specifically in fiscal year 2011, revenues decreased 4% in spite of 3% growth in units shipped, illustrating just how cost competitive this industry is.SSD, or solid storage drives, is generally a much faster option but also much pricier and Seagate has limited exposure to this product. Cost per gigabyte for an HDD is about $.10 compared to $1.75 for SDD. Currently, SSD is the default storage device in the new Ultra book category, tablets, and MP3s and smart phones. As SSD technology continues to improve, it will almost certainly eat into HDD sales.Shaky economic growth will also affect Seagate. As noted, Seagate is dependent upon major disk drive customers such as HP, Dell, and other companies that produce or otherwise demand storage capacity. If PC and other application growth is slow, especially in Asia where PC market share by region is highest, Seagate's growth will slow as well as demand from these clients declines.Seagate's annualized dividend yield of 4.04% with a payout ratio of 17.29% and 5 year growth average of 21.35% is impressive. However, it had to suspend dividends in 2009 and 2010, paying .03 cents in Q1 2009 and not paying a dividend again until Q2 2011. This is not a good precedent moving forward. This was largely influenced by events in 2009, including the global downturn leading to decreased demand, which in turn led to a markdown of $2.3 billion in Seagate's goodwill and a $271 million unfavorable adjustment on deferred taxes.Finally, while Debt/ Equity may be an unreliable statistic for Seagate given such dramatic negative retained earnings stemming from losses in 2009, Debt/ Assets paints a stronger and more-easy-to compare picture. With a Debt/ Assets of 34.37% TTM, Seagate carries much more debt than Western Digital or Hitachi, which boast ratios of 9.08% and 29.13% respectively. This is worrisome, since the company has had to suspend dividends in the past and is financing a larger portion of its operations with debt than its competitors.The Chart and Historical Price Comments:After experiencing a greater than 300% gain between last October and this May, from $10/ share to a high of $32.55/ share, Seagate has traded between $22 and $25 dollars for all of June. In the past 52 weeks, the disk drive manufacturer has gained 50.09%. Volumes indicate that this range is being widely supported, with much higher than average volume recently (approximately 90 million shares trading hands on June 29th), well above the 90-day average volume of approximately 13 million.Technically, the 20 day moving average is below the 50 day moving average (a short-term bearish signal). Both are above the 200 day moving average. The MACD is below the center line, a negative indicator. However, it crossed the signal line in mid-June, a positive signal. Look for the 200 day moving average to be a heavy support level while the 50 day moving average should provide some resistance.Margins:All margins have improved considerably quarter over quarter for the past 4 quarters. Continued improvements in both gross and operating margins will be essential considering the competitive nature of the industry and the ensuing price erosion. Revenue growth for the close of FY 2012 should be strong, as a very high 65.12% revenue growth quarter over quarter in Q3 2012 should buoy this number.Price erosion ate into margins in FY 2011, while FY 2010 represented a major step forward from Seagate as it recovered from a significant industry downturn in 2009.DCF: Indicates Seagate is fairly valuedConclusion:Passing my test, Seagate currently trades at a mere 5.69 P/E TTM and a very low .16 PEG. Compared to its closest and most similar competitor, Western Digital, Seagate is slightly undervalued by almost all ratios and posts much stronger returns on investment and assets. Significantly, improving margins and recent quarterly revenue growth are bullish indicators for Seagate. However, the suspension of dividends in 2009 is very disconcerting, as is its financing of larger portions of its programs with debts.Beyond Seagate's fundamentals, the fact that it is reliant upon revenues primarily from HDD sales must be weighted carefully. If one is bullish on economic conditions and believes that PC growth and business demand for digital storage will ultimately create demand for component HDD parts, then Seagate could be a decent play. SSD growth, HDD's counterpart, must also be carefully considered. I believe that at least in the short to intermediate term, SSD will not dramatically hamper HDD growth. Although SSD is commanding in tablets, ultra books, and smaller devices such as MP3s and smart phones, users requiring cheaper options for large amounts of storage will inevitably gravitate towards HDD, at least in the short to intermediate term. The fact of the matter is that 10 cents per gigabyte is simply far more enticing than the benefits derived from $1.75 per gigabyte via SSD. Thus, corporations and other establishments with large PC and cloud storage needs will still demand HDD. I believe that this sector has a moderately growing demand base, which will allow both HDD and SSD to experience growth; however, SSD will grow quicker especially if costs can be brought down. Ultimately, HDD is the much older, established technology while SSD is just beginning to become relevant and perfected.Given the DCF, P/E ratios, and qualitative data, I believe that Seagate is currently fairly valued. Considering that the report of results for fiscal year 2012 for Seagate is on July 17th, I would wait until after earnings to disseminate competitive pressures moving forward as well as guidance towards what demand will look like for the rest of the year. Seagate's improved margins are comforting, but I think that waiting two weeks for a more full and complete picture about Seagate's business going forward is the wisest choice.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

In 2008, it became the first company in the world to ship a billion hard drives.It's also #1 in another respect -- from a ""bang for your buck"" perspective, it may just be the best tech company you can invest in. I believe that at the current share price (a 25% discount to the 52-week high), Seagate presents a great buy opportunity.Click to enlarge.Source: FreeStockCharts.comCompany Growth Prospects: ★★★★★Seagate is experiencing explosive growth. Year over year EPS growth on a TTM basis is 173% (vs industry average of 69%) and EPS growth on a same quarter year-on-year basis is a staggering 1,080%.These statistics reflect Seagate's aggressive expansion stratey. Seagate recently acquired French storage maker LaCie, enabling it to increase market penetration in Europe and Japan. Seagate has a history of strong growth in the Asia-Pacific Region, and the acquisition will allow it to expand its footprint even faster.According to Teh Ban Seng, Vice President of Seagate Asia-Pacific,  the HDD industry is expected grow 30 percent and rake in $20 billion  in the next three years, with the enterprise and solid-state drive (NYSE:SSD)  businesses serving as key growth drivers:Stock Valuation Overview: ★★★★★Key valuation metrics suggest Seagate is substantially undervalued. The trailing P/E ratio, 5-yr PEG ratio, Price/Cash Flow ratio, Price/Sales ratio, and Price/Book ratio are all substantially below industry averages. Considering the S&P 500's 15.5x trailing P/E ratio, Seagate's P/E ratio is absurdly low, especially considering the growth statistics I just outlined.Analyst/Investor Opinion: ★★★★★Seagate has also attracted the attention of famous hedge fund manager David Einhorn. In the second quarter, Einhorn acquired 8.6 million shares, representing 2% of Seagate's total market cap. In total, Einhorn's Greenlight Capital owns 23.1 million Seagate shares, worth over $560M at current market prices.Return Potential: ★★★★★As reflected in the valuation section, Seagate is substantially undervalued in terms of financial metrics. In terms of P/E ratio, the stock can stand to double and still look cheap.Seagate also has a solid dividend and shareholder-friendly management. At current market price, Seagate's $0.25 quarterly dividend works out to an annualized yield of just over 4%. The dividend was originally reestablished in 2011 at 18 cents, and subsequently increased by 7 cents (39%). Seagate is committed to maximizing shareholder value through dividend increases as well as stock buybacks.Cautionary FactorsOne potential headwind to analyze before investing is the rise of cloud computing. Seagate derives a large percentage of revenue and earnings from consumer hard drives. As cloud computing comes into favor, large consumer hard drives and backup external hard drives may become less popular. While storage media will always be required somewhere (cloud computing still requires hard drives in servers), Seagate may need to shift strategies in the future to adapt to changing market conditions.I believe Seagate is already anticipating and responding to this issue with product lines such as their Backup Plus hard drives, which sync with the cloud, PCs, mobile devices like iPads, and social media sites like Flickr and Facebook to keep consumers' data safe. They are establishing a strong presence in the server sector as well with products like the Pulsar SSD.Competitors and Related CompaniesWestern Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is the only other major player in the hard drive sector. Western Digital boasts similar stats to Seagate, and might be worth a look as well. The lack of many major competitors gives Seagate a strong moat.Conclusion: Seagate's a Screaming BuyI believe Seagate is substantially undervalued. The stock is an investor's dream: strong growth, low valuation, high dividend, and strong moat. Another quarter of strong earnings could spur a very sharp rally.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in STX, WDC over the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: I am an individual investor, not a licensed investment advisor or broker dealer.

656821,25047,2012-06-13T10:57:03-04:00,,"Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) seems like a bargain. When you look at the numbers, it just jumps out at you, with a forward 2012 P/E of just 3.2 times and even higher EPS predicted for 2013.Yet, care must be taken with these numbers. They're still based on hard disk pricing that was a result of 2011's Thailand floods which caused an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) component shortage, and that pricing is probably going away.There are also two major trends in Seagate's market that are important to know. I call them ""the good"" and ""the bad"".The GoodHDD's are still a staple in large data centers. That's not about to change as their combination of capacity and cost is still wildly advantageous, even if they lack SSDs' (Solid State Drive) speed.This means HDDs are a prime beneficiary of the cloud computing trend, and the trend for more data storage in general.The BadThe mobile revolution uses no HDDs. There are no HDDs in smartphones or tablets. Additionally, the largest PC segment - laptops - is also seemingly evolving towards ditching the HDD altogether. Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Ultrabooks are now mostly being designed with SSDs due to their lower power requirements, weight and speed.This means that within a few years an entire large segment of the market will see lower demand for HDDs. As with any market, reduced demand can have a devastating effect on pricing and margins (as well as revenues, suffering both from a volume and pricing effect).ConclusionFor now the market is clearly seeing the negative effect from mobile and laptops increasingly not using HDDs as overwhelming the data center demand for HDDs. I can't say I disagree, this together with lowered pricing in an after-Thailand market should mean existing earnings estimates are too high.I'd stand clear of Seagate for now. Can't say I'd short it, though, given the already aggressively low valuation. This conclusion also applies to Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).Disclosure: I am long INTC."
654911,29571,2012-06-12T17:51:55-04:00,,"Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) is a good buy at around $23 per share and here are 10 compelling reasons why you should buy Seagate's shares:(1) Seagate's current forward P/E, or price-to-earnings ratio, is a very low 2.4. This means that its entire market capitalization (the amount which the market values the company) is only a bit more than Seagate will earn in the following 2 years, provided earnings stay stable. Yes, it is possible that earnings will decrease because its main competitor Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) will be ramping up production of hard drives after the flooding in Thailand which temporarily decreased WDC's production of hard drives, but even if earnings decrease by 50% Seagate would still be undervalued at under a P/E of 5, and it is unlikely that Seagate's earnings will decrease that much. Seagate's current P/E is already a very low 5.2 and Seagate's P/E will be going even lower in the near future as explained above.Check out Seagate's chart sourced from CNN Money:(2) Seagate's PEG ratio, or price-to-earnings-growth ratio, is a very low .2. Most investors recognize that any stock under a 1 PEG ratio is slightly to substantially undervalued by the current market. Stocks with a PEG ratio of just .2 are quite rare and usually represent a stock that is very undervalued by the current market. The main concern over Seagate has been that the relative newcomer solid-state drives will increasingly eat into the market share of Seagate's magnetic hard drives, particularly in smaller consumer devices such as the iPhone and iPad and similar competitors' mobile computing devices. However, history shows that hard disk drives have consistently been the dominant data storage device since shortly after 1956 when they were invented by IBM. Hard drives are likely to maintain this data storage dominance because they are continually advancing in their recording capacity, cost, reliability and speed, despite innovations from their more costly competitor solid-state drives. It is true that solid-state drives will continue to dominate in the mobile computing devices arena, but it is equally true that hard drives will continue to dominate in the desktop, laptop, servers, external storage and mainframe computers arena. Furthermore, Seagate's CEO Stephen Luczo has publicly stated his conviction that solid-state drives will be complementary to hard drives but will not replace hard drives.Take a look at Seagate's core numbers (yes these numbers are correct):Forward P/E 2.39PEG 0.21Price/Cash per share 4.69Price to Sales 0.72Return on Equity 63.89%(3) There is a huge trend toward cloud data storage that has been developing in recent years and will continue to expand in upcoming years. This trend has been labeled the ""big data"" trend. Seagate and its' primary competitor Western Digital are both well-positioned to capitalize on this huge trend as cloud data storage centers will continue to need and demand low cost high capacity hard drives to store these huge amounts of data. Legal compliance also requires that companies store huge amounts of data for purposes of later discovery. Huge industries require huge amounts of data storage, including: encyclopedias such as Wikipedia which seeks to catalog all human knowledge about everything, online databases such as ancestry.com, historical internet traffic which is estimated to be over 10 zettabytes per year, social networking sites such as Facebook and Yahoo groups, and huge amounts of audio and video needing to be stored from all private and public sectors.(4) The MACD and RSI, among other technical indicators, show Seagate to currently be in substantially oversold territory.(5) Seagate's growth numbers are outstanding. Seagate has a current return on equity of 64%, a current return on investment of 32.5%, and a current return on assets of 21.5%. Seagate's earnings growth of 477% this year is an outlier due to the flooding of WDC's production facilities in Thailand. I note with a dry sense of humor that if you are long STX like me you wish for more flooding in Thailand (of course I'm just kidding).(6) Seagate's insider ownership is over 12% of the outstanding stock. I like it when a company has a fairly high percentage of insider ownership because it means that the insiders believe in the company and they are willing to put money where their mouth is and they are incentivized to work hard to grow the company because the have a substantial stake in the company beyond just base salary compensation. Additionally, Seagate has substantial institutional ownership at 75% which I also like because institutional investors are considered smarter money than retail investors so it appears STX is a relatively safe well-heeled bet.Also outstanding, Seagate's board has authorized company share repurchases of $2.5 billion. This confirms that Seagate believes its own company is substantially undervalued by the current market, it also helps to protect shareholder value by retiring millions of shares and it has a substantial anti-dilutive effect. I hate it when a company I partially own issues tons of more shares and dilutes my percentage of ownership in the company. Seagate is doing the reverse, with each share they repurchase they are increasing my relative ownership percentage in the company.(7) One of the things I love about Seagate and Western Digital is that they have a virtual duopoly on the hard drive market since Seagate recently purchased Samsung's hard drive business and Western Digital purchased Hitachi's hard drive business. This makes it likely that there will not be large price-cutting between the two, as you might see where there are large numbers of competitors in a single market. Instead, in order to protect its own pricing power, the company will probably be roughly matching each other's pricing at reasonable market levels, as opposed to slashing each other's prices. The only other competitor in the hard drive market is Toshiba but Toshiba has only about a 10% market share.(8) Seagate's revenues are expected to be about $15 billion this year and were about $11 billion last year. Its revenue streams appear to be fairly solid and stable with pricing power, large barriers to entry and a wide and sustainable economic moat into the foreseeable future, with the exception that Western Digital will be more of a competitor as they are getting fully back on-line in production of hard drives in Thailand, and with the exception that solid-state drives will continue to incrementally eat into Seagate's profits. It is this author's opinion however that the threat from solid-state drives is exaggerated and actually far less than the market is baking into the share price. Seagate's next year's earnings are projected to be about $1 billion per quarter, which is why Seagate is repurchasing shares hand over fist, given the market values the entire company at about $9.6 billion.(9) Seagate's current dividend yield is about 4.5% per year, which operates as an insurance policy against the possibility of a declining share price, as you will get paid to wait until the share price recovers. It is anticipated that Seagate will not cut its dividend but if anything will increase the dividend given the large piles of cash they are accumulating and the recent quarterly dividend increase from 18 cents per share to 25 cents per share. Note however that Seagate's dividend was suspended during the 2009-2010 Great Recession period.(10) The last reason why Seagate is a good buy is the fact that investing guru David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital also thinks that Seagate is undervalued and has been accumulating 23.1 million shares, or 5.4% ownership of all outstanding shares in the company, as was just reported in the news today. Why should you care what David Einhorn thinks? David Einhorn started Greenlight Capital in 1996 with just $900,000 but has become close to a billionaire through very astute money management. He has achieved a highly respectable 22% annualized return for investors in a very challenging timeframe which included the huge bursting of the dot com and tech stock bubble and the Great Recession. Quite frankly, sometimes the best way to invest, especially if you don't have much time to research and analyze the thousands of potential investments, is to follow what the big money/smart money is investing in.Here's the caveat emptor: from a bottom-up analysis of the technicals and fundamentals it would appear that STX is a strong buy, in fact it appears to be at the top of a short list of most compelling buys in the entire market. However, recently there have been unusually high market correlations so a top-down (macroeconomic) analytical paradigm is probably more important to how equities are moving, given the headline making European sovereign debt problems, FED policymaking decisions, unemployment numbers, political and government dysfunction, etc. Also, keep in mind that solid-state drives are incrementally decreasing the demand for hard drives. Also note that Seagate's most recent numbers are better than normal given the disruption to main competitor WDC's production facilities owing to the flooding in Thailand.Disclosure: I am long STX, WDC."
730291,31471,2012-07-18T15:33:29-04:00,,"Back in June, I advised that investors pick up shares of Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), a leader in the hard drive industry. I liked it for a lot of reasons: a dirt-cheap valuation, strong earnings growth, industry consolidation, a solid dividend, and best of all, support from my idol David Einhorn, who picked up a 5.4% stake.Seagate has been one of my best-performing investments so far this year. I picked it up at a cost basis of $23.20, and my brokerage account tells me it's appreciated 15.9% since I bought it.Despite the impressive run up in price, I still think Seagate is in a good place. It's definitely very tempting to sell the investment for a cool 16% gain, but investors largely brushed off Seagate's revenue forecast cut. While PC growth is sluggish, Seagate still has opportunities in other areas. The cloud computing and ""big data"" revolution will replace lost opportunities in the PC market with better opportunities in enterprise storage:The fundamental argument for Seagate is that whether storage remains local or shifts to the cloud, we're in an age of ever-increasing data usage and storage. Any company that can effectively fulfill that need by providing storage solutions has the benefit of strong secular tailwinds.Seagate has been serious about expanding, acquiring companies LaCie and DensBits to expand the product portfolio and SSD technology portfolio. I believe these acquisitions are a positive for the company, which has strong cash flow and a good balance sheet.Seagate was recently added to the S&P 500 index, marking its ""arrival"" as a brand-name stock. It's also worth noting that Seagate has a strong share repurchase program. All of these factors add up to a big plus for potential Seagate investors.While the stock obvious isn't as attractively valued as it was several weeks ago, I believe it still represents a good buy. P/E is still a bargain at around 6, and the 3.7% dividend is very solid. In the world of overpriced new-tech stocks, Seagate is a refreshing bargain.Disclosure: I am long STX."

Technology pundits are already considering that the tablet computers are poised to completely take over desktop sales.There cannot be smoke without fire though - and there is some reasoning behind this  frankly naive consideration. It is a fact that during the past year, tablet computers have somewhat cannibalized sales of laptops and even PCs. However, one needs to be realistic and understand that while these new technologies like NAND or flash drives will be the favored storage solution for niche devices dedicated to mobile computing, there is simply no other option that can replace the use of disk drives for desktops.Hard disk drives will continue to remain the storage solution for enterprise and PC markets, at least for the next few years.Here are the top 5 reasons why STX could be a great play for 2012-2013.Biggest risks to the trade include:Investors must consider these risks before making a play in STX, but considering its $41 target price, the risk/reward opportunity in STX  is really good.Disclosure: I am long URI, EMC."

In this time, it managed to reduce its employee count from 110,000 to just 50,000. It also more than halved the number of factories it owned from 24 to 11 and more than halved the number of design centers from 7 to 3. While this was happening, Seagate improved the number of drives it produced per quarter from 9 million to 20 million. This is a remarkable example of managerial efficiency in increasing productivity.Flooding in ThailandThe flooding in Thailand possibly benefited Seagate because it allowed Seagate to take significant market share from one of its closest competitors Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). Seagate's hard disk drive factory was located on higher ground than Western Digital's and so it was not affected while Western Digital's factory was flooded. The flooding damaged many of the HDD manufacturers because it led to a shortage of available parts so Seagate was hurt due to this. Seagate now has roughly 40% of the market, while Western Digital has between 20 and 25%.Q3 EarningsSeagate reported net income of $1.1 billion in its third fiscal quarter. Its earnings were $2.64 per share of revenues of $4.4 billion which surpassed Wall Street expectations by $0.53 per share. It had cash from operations of $938 million, repurchased 43.1 million shares of common stock, and its operating expenses were $3.164 billion due to the continued integration of Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) hard disk drive business.Samsung AcquisitionIn December of 2011, Seagate acquired Samsung's HDD business for $1.4 billion. As part of the deal, Seagate got Samsung's M8 2.5 inch HDD line. Furthermore, the company got a number of experienced employees from Samsung's South Korean facility in the process. This acquisition will help Seagate to expand its brand into the Asian marketplace fueling growth.RisksThere is increasingly aggressive competition that is driving down the prices of the products Seagate provides. Furthermore, new firms continue to enter the market and try to grasp some of the market share. Also, the flooding in Thailand shows how volatile the market is and how easily the HDD market can be overhauled.Nonetheless, Seagate is the established industry leader. It constantly releases new and updated products. Seagate spent heavily on product development which means its products are generally more technologically advanced and have better storage levels than its competitors.ConclusionSeagate is currently the market leader and as soon as Samsung's facilities become fully integrated costs should decrease rapidly. Seagate is also launching a new line of hard drives aimed at mobile phones, tablets and notebooks. They have started to capture one of the biggest markets for external storage and will continue to expand in this area. Therefore, Seagate is a great buy at the current price especially off Q3 earnings.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
510031,24105,2012-04-19T10:14:49-04:00,,"Seagate Technologies (STX), one of three surviving competitors in the disk drive market, reported blow out earnings for the first quarter Tuesday and closed Wednesday at $28.96. Seagate earned more than 1 billion dollars in the first quarter and is now trading at about 12 times quarterly earnings (yes, you read that correctly). Of course, everyone knows that the disk drive business isn't really profitable and is about to come to an abrupt end (I have been hearing that for about 10 years now), but somehow these guys keep minting money.The industry has gone through a massive consolidation and is down to three players: Seagate, Western Digital (WDC), and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). Given antitrust sensibilities, it is unlikely that there will be further consolidation. This is important because it may allow us to predict what will happen to the enormous amount of cash that Seagate has been throwing off.I use the sequential balance sheet method of evaluation in which I review the past quarter's balance sheet and compare it with the previous quarter's balance sheet to see where the cash lands at the end of the 90 days. When I performed this exercise with Seagate, at first I was baffled. Comparing March 30, 2012, numbers with Dec. 30, 2011, numbers it appeared that after a quarter in which Seagate earned over a billion dollars, debt stayed about the same, and balance sheet cash was actually down a little. There was a big buildup in Accounts Receivable, but that was matched by a big buildup in Accounts Payable. I put on my green eyeshade and dug deeper, hoping that I had stumbled upon the next Enron -- or at least maybe a Worldcom -- and I would go down in history as a forensic accounting sleuth. Where in the world did all the cash go?Part of the answer is that Seagate paid out over $100 million in dividends, but that is only about 10% of the cash the company generated (a low payout ratio, by the way, a topic we will revisit). But almost all the cash went for stock repurchases; $1.1 billion was spent purchasing some 43.1 million shares -- that's roughly 10% of the total issued shares in one quarter. Seagate also repurchased an additional 9.4 million shares after the end of the quarter in early April (through April 16). When you look at year-over-year share count (which I always try to examine to determine the net effect of repurchases and stock options), that number is actually slightly up. So, once again, I was momentarily baffled.The explanation is that Seagate made a large acquisition in late December 2011 (paying Samsung some 45.2 million shares), which increased share count prior to the repurchases. In essence, Seagate bought a big operation that expanded its business in late December and had completely paid for it out of earnings some 90 days later (by buying back the shares issued as the purchase price). A shareholder on April 1 owned essentially the same percentage of a much bigger company than the company he or she owned part of back on Dec. 1.So the question before the house is what will happen to the cash now that Seagate has reduced share count back to the pre-Samsung acquisition level. Most analysts predict cash flow of roughly $1 billion a quarter for the next five quarters. A buyback program at current share price levels and at the pace of the last quarter would reduce share count in half. But with the kind of buyback program under way it is unlikely that share price levels will remain this low. Dividends could certainly be increased. In addition, Seagate still has nearly $3 billion of debt, but net debt (debt minus balance sheet cash) is less than quarterly cash flow. I think that we will see more buybacks and a dividend increase. We will probably not see a major acquisition in the disk drive space because consolidation has pretty much run its course. Of course, the current stock price bakes in an expectation that the good times will not last forever and that current levels of earnings and cash flow are not sustainable. But between now and the ""day of reckoning,"" a great deal of financial engineering can be done to enhance per share value. We will be watching the cash each quarter to see how this plays out. With Seagate now paying a dividend north of 3%, it has moved up high on my list of attractive undervalued stocks.Disclosure: I am long STX."
517261,25258,2012-04-23T05:37:50-04:00,,"Solid-state drives (SSDs) may be the future of information storage, but try telling hard disk drive (HDDs) manufacturers that they're in the wrong business now and you'll be sure to get taught a lesson. Investors too, occupied with the inevitable transition to SSDs, are ignoring the fact that a much wider movement is upon them. The push towards cloud storage is inevitably growing demand at an alarming rate.As more and more information gets stored online, companies everywhere ranging from salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are driving up the need for the commodity that HDD storage space has become. Thanks in part due to the low-cost, high-storage nature of HDDs when contrasted to the alternative found in SSDs, manufacturers of HDDs have found that their medium-term future may be more secure than they're being given credit for on the market.Indeed, one of the additional reasons that HDDs makers have been taking in lofty profits stems from the fact that there has been an aggressive ongoing consolidation across the face of the industry. In December 2011, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) completed its acquisition of Samsung's HDD business for a total of $1.375 billion in cash and stock. In March 2012, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) officially announced the completed acquisition of Hitachi's HDD business. And with the finalization of these two companies, the market effectively became a duopoly were one to discount the small portion owned by Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF).All of this consolidation effectively comes on the heels of an industry already in recovery mode from the Thai flooding disaster which vastly served to raise HDD prices across the board as supply shrank. Yet for Seagate, such macro picture events have only proven to be prosperous for the HDD manufacturer. Emerging practically unscathed from the flooding incidents, the company has seized upon a unique opportunity to thrive in the present environment.For its own part, the company knows it's been rolling in the dough, and has taken full advantage of allowing the shareholder to partake in this. In January, the company raised the dividend yield by 39% to a comfortable $1 annually. Additionally, it further supported the stock buyback plan by adding another $1 billion to its limit. As a company now based in Ireland bound by Irish law, the company is required to release its buyback information for a set time after conducted. Investors can find that information on the company's IR page found here. Over the last month alone, investors should be encouraged to see that the company bought back nearly 3% of its outstanding shares - a testament to its own sense of self-worth. As seen below, the company has purchased significant lots of shares every single trading day without pause.Click to enlargeOn April 17, Seagate reported its 3Q earnings and knocked a home run. The company saw revenues rise 65% year over year to $4.45 billion and yielded an earnings per share of $2.64. This surpassed both top line and bottom line estimates which were being modeled around $4.37 billion in revenues and an EPS of $2.10.With analyst consensus currently expecting Seagate to earn $9.37/sh for June 2013, the figure would place Seagate with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 3.12 - an unthinkable value for most tech companies. Flash memory maker SanDisk (SNDK) for its part carries a forward P/E of 9.16 under its last price of $35.91. The same goes for SSD manufacturer Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) with its forward P/E of 10.71 under the last price of $6.64. It's clear that the market continues to discount the HDD makers, but the question remains to be answered as to how long this can truly be the case.Disclosure: I am long STX."

I completely agree.I too believe that Seagate will not be swept away by the cloud. Seagate's blow out third quarter wasn't entirely about the massive price hike caused by flooding in Thailand. Seagate actually had organic growth of 2.5% in the nine months ended March 2012 and 8% in the same quarter even as production emerged from flood ravaged Thailand. Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) HDD unit which was acquired in Q3-12 added 13% more.The trends toward mobile computing and cloud storage reduce the number of gigabytes per hard drive - this affects prices but does not reduce the number of units. Unless desktop and notebook sales fall off a cliff, the number of units sold is not going decrease dramatically. Seagate is addressing the fall out on pricing. PC shipments, which were earlier expected to stay flat in 2012, actually grew 1.9% in the first quarter of 2012 and are likely to grow 4.4% in calendar 2012, according to Gartner.The biggest shift to cloud storage was in Seagate's enterprise segment which saw reduced demand in the first nine months of fiscal 2012. However, Seagate's Enterprise segment is only 13% of total sales and weakness in this segment hardly impacted the bottom line.There are other concerns which over the next few years will drag margins down from the current highs - the Samsung acquisition, which is skewed towards Notebooks, will lead to a downward shift in pricing as OEMS up take a larger share of production, instead of wholesale distributors. Margins should fall to a more sedate 34.5% in fiscal 2013 instead of last quarter's 37%.There are only two other large players, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) left in this industry, with Seagate getting 43% market share - most of the capital investment is going towards cloud storage, capacity addition is not a threat; And as Seagate's CEO pointed out, storage for cloud servers will also require hard disk drives; the need for storage cannot be filled alone by solid state drives.Average analyst estimates call for earnings of 7.10 in fiscal 2012 and $ 9.42 in 2013, some of it buoyed by the massive share buybacks and hefty dividend. Seagate throws up gobs of cash and is using a lot it to reduce share count.I think Seagate's demise is grossly exaggerated and it remains undervalued at a forward P/E of 4.3.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
536551,21909,2012-04-27T11:54:14-04:00,,"I recently experienced a hard drive crash on my Mac. While getting it replaced, I noticed that solid-state flash drives have come down in price since I looked at them a year ago, whereas the more traditional hard drives with which we are all familiar have become more expensive. Those price increases can be attributed directly to the floods in Thailand earlier this year that impacted production capacity from Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), one of the three remaining large-scale hard drive manufacturers. This has created a shortage that has been affecting computer makers around the world.So I decided to install a solid-state drive with the promise of better performance and stability, but this also meant sacrificing storage space. A few weeks into this upgrade, I can now tell you that from my perspective the death of the traditional hard drive is still way down the road. I have had to use external drives to augment the lack of storage space in the solid-state drive. That got me thinking about the three traditional hard drive suppliers in the market: Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), Western Digital, and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF).As I did more research into solid-state drives I came across an interview with the chief executive of Seagate, Stephen Luczo. He makes a strong case that flash memory would be a complementary, not competitive, technology to standard hard drives, at least in the near future. He predicts continued strong demand for conventional hard drives and points out that much of the cloud storage services will also be located on hard disk drives, albeit in large, centralized locations.If the CEO of Seagate is right about that, where is the best place to invest to take advantage of the burgeoning need for more storage, especially after considerable industry consolidation? There are essentially only three major drive manufacturers and that's down from more than eight just a few years ago. One, Toshiba, does not trade in North America. So that effectively leaves us with only two choices: Western Digital and Seagate.To my mind, there's no contest. Only Seagate pays a significant dividend, currently $1 per share annually to yield 3.4%. The stock is trading at about four times projected 2012 earnings. Seagate has also been repurchasing its own stock aggressively and plans to reduce outstanding shares by 25% over the next year.Seagate's factories were unscathed by the massive flooding in Thailand. That has given them a competitive advantage over Western Digital, supporting pricing and strengthening Seagate's margins in the recent quarter. Of course this advantage is only temporary and eventually Western Digital's factories will come back online. But given the consolidation in the industry all three remaining suppliers have good pricing power going forward, even when Western Digital returns to full production.Seagate reported earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 on April 17 and absolutely crushed their numbers. Gross margins for the three months to March 30 were 37%, up from 32% in the previous quarter and 19% year ago. The company sold 61 million drives in the quarter for a total of $4.4 billion (figures in U.S. dollars), which is right in line with analysts' targets. That represents a 65% year-over-year revenue gain, which generated $2.48 per share in earnings. That easily beat the Street's estimates, which were $2.11 per share. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, Seagate earned $4.16 a share. Even if it did not add another penny in the fourth quarter, the p/e multiple would only be seven! Talk about a cheap tech stock!If you are concerned about the ongoing demand for traditional hard drives versus the solid-state drives that populate tablet computers, it should be noted that Seagate also entered that business back in 2009. They've been developing solid-state hybrid drives that combine the speed and stability of solid-state with the added storage capabilities of traditional systems.You could make the case that this is not a super sexy business but we all store thousands of songs, videos, and photographs either on our own drives or through cloud services. The demand for storage continues to grow exponentially and if any of you have experienced a hard drive meltdown like I did, you know how necessary it is to continually back up data. I just went out and bought more external hard drives to augment the backup systems that I already have in place.Seagate is a fast-growing company with high margins run by an investor-friendly management group. The stock, which closed on Friday at $29.21, is trading at an extremely inexpensive p/e ratio. Plus, you are getting an aggressive stock buyback plan and a healthy dividend. That's a good recipe for high returns.Action now: Buy Seagate at current levels with a target price of $35.Disclosure: I am long STX."

The recent stock surge has been buoyed by a hard drive shortage due to the Thailand floods last year and demand for solid state drives. However, now the valuations for STX look high and there are also reports that the hard drive shortage is easing.According to a recent Forbes article, BlueFin Research analyst Paul Peterson said in a note that That in turn is bad news for hard drive manufacturers such as STX as the prices for hard drives will fall. Below is an in depth look at the valuation metrics and stock chart.Valuation: Seagate Technology's trailing 5 year valuation metrics suggest that the stock is overvalued as all of the metrics are above their respective 5 year averages. Seagate Technology's current P/B ratio is 3.6 and it has averaged 2.5 over the past 5 years with a high of 4.2 and low of 1.2. Seagate Technology's current P/S ratio is 1 and it has averaged 0.7 over the past 5 years with a high of 1.1 and low of 0.2.Price Target: The consensus price target for the analysts who follow Seagate Technology is $32. That is upside of 21% from today's stock price of $26.57 and suggests that the stock is fairly valued at these levels.Forward Valuation: Seagate Technology is currently trading at about $27 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $8.85 next year, an earnings increase of 42% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 3. Taking a look at the company's publically traded comparisons will give us a better idea of the stock's relative valuation. Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is basically the only hard drive company and is currently trading at about $39 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $8.66 next year, an earnings increase of 33% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 4.5. This suggests that Seagate Technology is undervalued relative to WDC.EV/EBITDA: STX is trading at a 6.3 EV/EBITDA multiple while WDC is trading at a 3.3 EV/EBITDA multiple.Earnings Estimates: Seagate Technology has beaten EPS estimates 3 times in the past 4 quarters. The company's EPS figures have come in between -2 cents and 24 cents from consensus estimates or about -7.4% to 22.2% from analyst estimates. The company has reported earnings that have differed from analyst estimates by a wide margin which suggests that the stock may experience upside from earnings surprises.Price Action: Seagate Technology is up 100.5% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500, which is up 10.5%.

Since then, the stock has soared by 44%, beating the Dow Jones by more than 6.5x. I then presented a bullish case on Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) here and since then the stock has risen by 18.3%. Both firms saw massive earnings revisions with 24 being upward for Seagate and 21 being made upward for Western Digital for a net change of 38.7% and 63%, respectively. I continue to find meaning upside for both firms and believe that they will outperform EMC Corp. (EMC).From a multiples perspective, Western Digital is the cheapest of the three. It trades at a respective 13.3x and 6.2x past and forward earnings. EMC and Seagate trade at a respective 23.8x and 24x past earnings. Seagate stands out for being the only one to offer dividend distributions. And, moreover, management is very generous with returning free cash flow to shareholders, as evidenced by the dividend yield of 3.8%.At the second quarter earnings call, Seagate's management noted the impact of the Thailand flooding:Second quarter revenues and shipments met guidance and management believes that it will have 16.3% greater 2012 revenue than what the Street anticipates in 2012. Gross margins notably expanded to 31.7%, driven by supply shortages boosting pries. Management further believes that the flooding will have an enduring impact on how Seagate does business in the future. Customers are more cautious about supply chain management, which will cause a change in long-term purchasing agreements. Seagate receives roughly three-fifths of its production capacity from long-term purchasing agreements. In terms of financial shape, Seagate is performing well and it is positioned to quickly turn a net debt position to a net cash position of $4.4B by 2014.Consensus estimates for Seagate's EPS forecast that it will soar to $6.15 in 2011, grow by 34.6% in 2012, and then decline by 38.2% in 2013. Modeling a CAGR of 60.4% for EPS over the next three years and then discounting backwards by a WACC of 9% implies that Seagate could possibly double. Note that HDD firms have traded upwards of 20x, so the reward in this firm is substantial.EMC has a more than one-fourth share in the networked storage market. Solid investments in R&D are further supporting sustainable revenue growth while takeover activity is mitigating competitive pressures. EMC is shifting towards higher-margin revenue streams as it benefits from a rightward shift in underlying demand resulting from ever-increasing data growth. Cloud computing may represent some headwinds, but fourth quarter performance has reassured investors that management is on track to deliver its top-line target of $28B by 2013. EMC's solid financial shape further supports greater M&As that will help expand synergies through unlocking cost and revenue synergies. The Isilon acquisition, for example, has reassured investors about integration safety.Consensus estimates for EMC's EPS forecast that it will grow by 14.6% to $1.73 in 2012 and then by 13.9% and 11.7% in the following two years. Modeling a CAGR of 13.4% for EPS over the next three years and then discounting backwards by a WACC of 9% yields a fair value figure of $27.90, implying 5.7%.

Still, 14.8% is a number that would have to inspire a certain degree of confidence in the picks chosen by David Brown, Sabrient's founder and Chief Market Strategist, which were gleaned from the firm's quantitative models, with an assist from Gradient Analytics, the firm's qualitative division.And, it certainly would seem to be in step with the BD's past performance, coming in at 36%, 21% and 7.3%, respectively, over the last three years.A big reason the Baker's Dozen is performing as well as it is right now is due to Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), which was the top-rated pick on the list. Seagate shot up over 20% on Wednesday, following an early morning earnings announcement that beat both revenue and EPS estimates. STX ended the day at 25.52, up over 50% for the year so far.So is Seagate a horse that has run its course? Or does it still have some room to run?If you take a look under the hood, the same fundamentals that enabled it to make it to the top of the BD list remain intact.STX, the only technology firm on Sabrient's list, is expected to grow earnings by over 160% this year and to average nearly 20% growth per year over the next five years. It has the lowest projected P/E (4.45) among the Baker's Dozen, and it offers a dividend yield of 4.4%.Seagate's main business is the design and manufacture of hard disk drives (HDD) for a variety of applications, including enterprise servers, mainframes, workstations, desktop and notebook computers, digital video recorders, personal data backup systems, portable external storage systems, and digital media systems.Of particular note, STX acquired the HDD division of Samsung in December 2011. The fact that Samsung's component manufacturers were untouched by recent flooding in Thailand gives STX, the largest HDD manufacturer in the world, a significant advantage over competitors like Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).While it is a common trait of investors to chase the boat after missing it, Seagate may stand as a good example of a company with strong enough fundamentals to power this particular vehicle over the course of the year.Here is a complete list of the Baker's Dozen.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The unchanged potential return represents the return received at expiration assuming the price of the stock has not changed from entry. A protected covered call position may be entered by selling a call option against a stock and using some of the proceeds to purchase a put option for protection.The 8% maximum potential loss parameter was selected, as experiencing a loss of 8% can typically be recovered from without too much difficulty using income generating investing techniques. Finding a position in an upward trend was performed by selecting to find a stock with a 200 day moving average greater than the company's 250 moving day average. The search for a position near the lower Bollinger Band operates as a contrarian parameter for finding stocks which have recently receded in price. The specific call option to sell is the 2012 Apr 27 at $1.47 and the put option to purchase is the 2012 Apr 24 at $0.63. A profit/loss graph for one contract of the protected covered call is shown below:As a bonus, if the price of the stock is equal to or greater than the strike price of the call option at expiration in April, the position will return 4.7% (46.4% annualized).With St. Patrick's day forthcoming, finding a Seagate protected covered call is perfect to consider as the company is headquartered in Ireland. Seagate is involved in the design, manufacture and marketing of computer hard disk drives. In Seagate's most recent Q2 2012 earnings call held on January 31, 2012, the company indicated they believe the low point for industry production of hard disk drives occurred in mid-December, a couple of months later than some industry observers had predicted.According to the company, the flood disaster in Thailand was the fourth-largest natural disaster in history with a price tag of $45 billion. Due to the flooding, manufacture of hard disk drives in Thailand was severely impacted. Seagate indicated they opted to trade taking short-term profit from the supply disruption and instead make long-term commitments with customers in order to forge stronger relationships and more stable margins. The company also indicated they were auctioning off some hard drives which could result in a pleasant surprise in the company's next earnings release.Seagate completed the acquisition of Samsung's hard drive in December of 2011 enabling the company to increase the volume of hard drives manufactured.Competitors to Seagate include Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Fujitsu.Seagate's stock price took a nice jump in price following the recent earnings release and conference call as shown below:The protected covered call position is protected from a fall in price below the $24 price level due to the purchased 2012 Apr 24 put option.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The company was founded in 1979 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.Analysts are expecting an improvement of $0.75 in earnings per share compared to last quarter's results of $0.34. The estimated mean earnings are $1.09 per share. Analyst estimates range between $1.05 and $1.16 per share.The P/E ratio has dropped, as the current trailing twelve months P/E ratio is 16.5, while the forward P/E ratio is now 3.91.From a month ago, the stock has increased in price 24.84%, and moving in price 46.08% from one year ago.The stock has done very well as compared to the overall market. When comparing to the S&P 500, the year to date difference is 15.20%.Just in case you missed it above let me repeat it, the PE RATIO IS ABOUT FOUR. YES - 4! Ok, by the time you read this it will likely be higher, but for a very good reason (beyond the fact this could be a better buy than AAPL). The company just announced the dividend is rising to $1 per share per year. That makes the yield about 5% (or in other words, 5% higher than Apple). While I am not a big fan of stock repurchases, as I believe it represents managments inability to find better uses of captial, this company headquartered in Dublin also announced an increase in its stock repurchase program.If Seagate is announcing a dividend increase ahead of earnings, how do YOU believe the guidance and conference call is going to be received? I will let you draw your own conclusions on the prospects of 2012 with Seagate.From my seat the chart looks great with the 90 day moving average breaking above the 200 day and the price ""gap and go"" from the start of the year. As you will read below, 2011 was a tough year and one investors will likely want to forget about quickly. 2011 is so yesterday though, and I expect good things to come out of the earnings report on Tuesday. Short interest is low, but the shorts that are still around are going to feel a burning squeeze around their necks for the near term.Revenue growth appears to be problematic for management. Comparing year-over-year fiscal years, revenue has declined to $10.97 billion for 2011 vs. $11.40 billion for 2010. The bottom line has falling earnings year-over-year of $511.00 million for 2011 vs. $1.61 billion for 2010.The company's earnings before interest and taxes are falling with an EBIT year-over-year of $806.00 million for 2011 vs. $1.74 billion for 2010. Lower revenue along with a drop in earnings is often one of the last signs to get out of the way of a falling stock price.Here is a look at the fiscal year revenue.Here is the last few quarters to get an idea how well they perform compared to estimates:Reported earnings per share compared to the mean estimate.

447571,24866,2012-03-21T03:27:57-04:00,,"As the economy improves, technology will be a prime beneficiary. Ever-increasing data supply will drive demand for computer storage devices. As an IR consultant, I expect IceWEB (OTCPK:IWEB) and Entorian Technologies (OTC:ENTN) to significantly appreciate due to these strong secular trends. The two not-so-well-followed companies are significantly undervalued and have the potential to outperform if only press coverage improves.In the meanwhile, firms like Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), EMC Corporation (EMC) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) receive nearly all of the attention. In this article, I will run you through a DCF analysis on Seagate and then triangulate the result with an exit multiple calculation and a review of the fundamentals compared to EMC and Western.First, let's begin with an assumption about revenues. Seagate finished FY2011 with $11B in revenue, which represented a 3.72% decline off of the preceding year. I model a 22% per annum growth rate over the next six years, roughly in-line with consensus.Moving on to the cost-side of the equation, there are several items to consider: operating expenses, capital expenditures, and taxes. I expect cost of goods sold to eat 77% of revenue versus 4% for SG&A, 8% for R&D, and 7% for capex. Taxes are estimated to trend from 15% in 2012 to 20% in 2017.We then need to subtract out net increases in working capital. I model accounts receivable as 15% of revenue, inventories as 9% of COGS, accounts payable as 17% of OPEX, and accrued expenses as 180% of SG&A.Taking a perpetual growth rate of 2.5% and discounting backwards by a WACC of 12% yields a fair value figure of $33.13, implying 25.3% upside.All of this falls under the context of a devastating supply chain disruption, as noted by management:From a multiples perspective, Seagate is highly attractive. It trades at 12.7x past earnings, but only 3x forward earnings. Meanwhile, EMC trades at a respective 26.4x and 14.7x past and forward earnings, while Western trades at a respective 13.1x and 4.4x past and forward earnings. Where Seagate's multiples go from here is largely a matter of speculation, as it is more an issue of macro trends. But with an exit multiple of only 3 required for appreciation, Seagate is in my view at a bottom.I hold the same view for Western. Consensus estimates predict a wild ride that will help drive high risk-adjusted returns. Management is also equipped with deep-industry knowledge. The $3.9B cash plus equity buyout of Hitachi Global Storages will also unlock revenue and cost synergies, improve scale, and hedge against competitive, as well as macro pressures. The company is already the global leader in external storage solutions; its My Book Thunderbolt Duo dual-drive, the first external hard drive on Thunderbolt Technology, will help extend the lead. With only a multiple of 4.4x needed for value creation, the downside for Western is also minimal, while the upside is explosive.EMC, on the other hand, has more than 25% of the networked storage market in its bag. To combat competitive pressures, the company is making strong investments in R&D and shifting towards higher margin markets. EMC also has a solid balance sheet that can finance accretive takeover activity. The Isilon acquisition was, for example, a step in the right direction. In the meanwhile, however, headwinds from cloud computing will limit value creation. And, at higher multiples than peers, EMC appreciation will likely underperform that of Western and Seagate in the event of a full recovery.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: We seek IR business from all of the firms in our coverage, but research covered in this note is independent and for prospective clients.

310709,24414,2011-11-29T09:13:33-05:00,,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) raised revenue and gross margin guidance for the December 2011 and March 2012 quarters after the market closed yesterday. This confirms analyst speculation last month after the company announced its Q3 report that while being a horrible tragedy in terms of the loss of life and economic impacts, the Thailand flooding may actually benefit STX. This is because STX's factories have emerged relatively unscathed, in contrast to rivals Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Toshiba.WDC, for example, announced earlier that revenues would fall more than 50% Q/Q in Q4. In contrast, STX's guidance yesterday indicates that revenues will be flat Q/Q for Q4, and they will rise by a third Q/Q for the March 2012 quarter. Furthermore, pricing is expected to firm up due to the expected shortage of hard disk drives (HDD), with market research firm iSuppli projecting that HDD prices could go higher by 10% in Q4. Thus, overall, the Thailand flooding may help STX gain market share, increase revenues, gross margins and operating profit going forward at least in the short-term.While much of this was known qualitatively prior to yesterday's announcement, as reflected in the strong rally in STX shares since the Q3 announcement on October 19th, there was still nervousness that component supply constraints would hinder revenue and profit growth. The company's announcement yesterday lays most of those doubts to rest. The company raised guidance for the December quarter to $2.8 billion (versus $2.65 billion estimate), with gross margins higher by 150-300 basis points above the high end of the company's long-term, targeted gross margin range of 22%-26%. For the March 2012 quarter, the company guided revenues to $3.75 billion (versus $3.24 billion estimate), including revenues from the recent acquisition of Samsung's HDD business, and gross margins at least 300 basis points higher than the high-end of the 22%-26% earlier target range. Applying this to the company's income statement model, we estimate that the company would earn between 60c-70c in Q3 (versus 47c estimate) and $1.00-$1.10 in Q4 (versus 78c estimate).At its $16 closing price yesterday, STX is trading at less than 5 forward P/E while earnings at least in the short-term are projected to rocket up from $1.24 in 2011 to well over $3 in 2013, as the company also gains market share. In contrast, its chief rival in the hard-disk drive industry, WDC, trades at 6-7 forward P/E while in the short-term while earnings are projected flat to down in the short-term. Also, Sandisk Corp. (SNDK), manufacturer of non-volatile removable memory cards, trades at 9-10 forward P/E while earnings are projected to rise by 5% a year; LSI Corp. (NASDAQ:LSI-OLD), a designer of ICs used in hard disk and solid state drives (SSD), trades at 10-11 forward P/E while earnings are projected to rise by 5% a year; Netapp Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP), a manufacturer of integrated network storage and data management hardware, trades at 13-14 forward P/E, while earnings are projected to rise by 12% a year; EMC Corp. (EMC), provider of enterprise storage systems and software, trades at 13 forward P/E, while earnings are projected to rise by 16% a year; SSD manufacturer STEC Inc. (NASDAQ:STEC) trades at over 75 forward P/E, while earnings are projected to plummet from 69c in 2010 to 11c in 2012; and SSD manufacturer OCZ Technology Group (NASDAQ:OCZ) trades at 11-12 P/E, while earnings are projected to rocket from 24c loss in 2011 to 53c earnings in 2013. (We also recommended buying OCZ earlier last month, prior to a 60% rally in the stock in less than six weeks).We believe that STX is a buy at these levels, and would recommend scaling into it, buying it on dips, given that it is already up more than 70% from the lows in October. Thailand, based on estimates by iSuppli, accounts for 25% of the world's overall HDD output, and 45% of the mobile PC HDD market. As such, the impact from the Thailand flooding is expected to last at least until 2013, when supply is expected to finally catch up with rising demand, and we believe that STX may see rising earnings and share prices for quite some time as it benefits from the supply disruption and rising prices.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in STX over the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes  only.

320830,24866,2012-01-20T06:00:33-05:00,,"The Street once again made substantial revisions to EPS estimates for Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX). Of the last 23 revisions to estimates, 21 have gone up for a net change of 50.4%. While I am bullish on the company, lack of near-term visibility is not for the risk-averse. The firm continues to benefit from Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) flood disruptions that have constrained hard drive supply. A less volatile peer that also has meaningful upside is EMC Corporation (EMC). Based on my multiples analysis and DCF model, I find myself in agreement with the bullish sentiments on the Street for these storage companies.From a multiples perspective, Seagate is the cheaper of the two. It trades at a respective 17.6x and 4.4x past and forward earnings while EMC trades at a respective 22x and 13x past and forward earnings. Western Digital trades at a respective 10.2x and 6x past earnings. And although Seagate stands out with its dividend yield of 3.7%, its beta is roughly double that of its competitors. Currently, the company is rated a weak ""buy"" while EMC is rated near a ""strong buy"".There are several reasons why EMC merits this favorable rating. At the third quarter earnings call, the firm's CEO, Joe Tucci, noted favorable progress:With its penetration into Big Data and hybrid cloud computing, the company has well positioned itself in high-growth opportunities. The company is experiencing the fastest growth in, conveniently, the highest-margin segments, such as in Data Domain. In addition, almost half of the company's VNX platform wins are coming outside of the EMC universe. The top supplier of enterprise storage systems further is expected to have 12% growth in top-line and, according to Credit Suisse, will benefit from a 300 bps expansion in storage share to 30%.Consensus estimates for EMC's EPS are that it will grow by 18.3% to $1.49 in 2011 and then by 14.8% and 15.8% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 18x and a conservative 2012 EPS of $1.64, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $29.52, implying 32.7% upside. Modeling a CAGR of 16.3% and then discounting backwards at a WACC of 9% yields a fair value of $25. Despite significant risks, this indicates a clear buying opportunity.The main problem that Seagate stems from competitive disruptions. Performance-superior NAND memory and solid-state drive have stated dropping in price, putting the pressure on HDDs. I am not saying that they going to dominate HDDs in the next three years, but as a recovery nears investors will start to focus on this longer-term horizon, as opposed to more of the here-and-now. And with the purchase of Hitachi's HDD business by Western Digital the pressure is mounting on the mission-critical business of Seagate. Furthermore, PCs continue to experience pressure from the tablet revolution.Consensus estimates for Seagate's EPS are that it will grow by 275.8% to $4.66 in 2012 and then decline by 0.6% and 33.9% in the following two years. Even if the multiple is only 6x and 2013 EPS turns out to be 10.3% below consensus, the stock will still soar by 28.4%. Accordingly, while the Street rates the stock only a weak ""buy"", I am considerably more optimistic.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
307423,22670,2011-11-11T22:38:58-05:00,,"By now, most technology investors are aware of the tragic floods that have hobbled Thailand. The impact on its populace cannot be underestimated. Similarly, the impact on global hard disk drive (HDD) supply is unpreceded.In fact, the fallout runs so deep that most investors still haven’t fully grasped the implications.Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX), however, seems acutely aware of them.Since October 4, shares of STX have nearly doubled from less than 10 to nearly 20. That’s an impressive run, but a move above 30 appears to be in the making. Last week, Seagate CEO Steve Luczo presented at the Needham investor conference. There, he spoke graciously of his largest rival, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). However, he didn’t stop short of hinting that the competitive landscape has been changed for years to come.The reason? Mr. Luczo suggests that some of WDC’s most critical equipment was damaged beyond repair. According to several sources, much of WDC’s sensitive machinery was located on the ground floor of a building that was inundated with over three feet of water. It has been widely reported that this water has since turned toxic due to an unsavory mix of chemicals, sewage, and organisms.The waterlogged equipment is responsible for producing most of WDC’s worldwide supply of “sliders”. Suffice it to say that sliders are a necessary component in HDDs. Without them, an HDD can’t function. Before the flooding began, WDC’s Thailand operations produced 25% of the world’s sliders – roughly 75% of WDC’s personal supply.WDC produces a small quantity of sliders in the Philippines.  It also purchases some sliders from TDK, the Japanese electronics giant. However, these sources are only enough for WDC to produce about 15 million HDDs per quarter. That’s just one-fourth of normal production.Even a 20% increase in HDD prices will leave WDC with less than $1B in quarterly revenue, far below Wall Street’s already-lowered estimates. As a capital-intensive company, the impact on WDC’s EPS will be even more dramatic, moving from large profits to large losses.At present, many investors are only looking at this as a Q4 / Q1 event. However, based on the lead-times required to obtain new equipment, shore up its facilities, and ramp production, WDC may not be whole until the end of next year. Further, keep in mind that next year’s monsoon season could produce a repeat of this year’s disaster. Rain is obviously the root cause, but the horrific flooding was a direct result of all the roads and buildings that have been recently erected over land that once soaked up the rains. In other words, WDC can’t just dry out its facility and go back to business as usual. In fact, it may have to start from scratch.Meanwhile, STX’s facilities and partner-channel are relatively unscathed. Because of this, the company is setting itself up to take long-term advantage of the situation. This runs counter to the view of analysts who believe WDC will quickly rebound and regain share. In reality, that will prove difficult, since STX is now signing the industry’s most important customers to multi-year supply agreements. Its value proposition is simple -- Seagate can provide them with a quantity of drives that WDC cannot. If you want those drives, you have to commit to STX as your primary supplier for the next several years.The scenarios described above have been confirmed by data points gathered by my company, Pipeline Data. They have also been confirmed via commentary from Mr. Luczo’s presentation, along with information recently gleaned from equipment suppliers like Intevac (NASDAQ:IVAC), Xyratex (NASDAQ:XRTX), and Veeco Instruments (NASDAQ:VECO).Running the numbers, we see STX gaining significant market share and maintaining much of it even after WDC is back to full capacity. The longer-term problem for WDC is that its competitors are increasing their manufacturing capacity to narrow the supply/demand gap (which currently stands at 20 million HDDs per month). Once WDC finally comes back online, its rejuvenated capacity will soon result in a glut of HDD production. Thus the supply/demand equation will reverse, leading to steep price declines and heightened competition. For STX, this won’t be a big problem -- it will still have many large customers signed to longer-term agreements. As for WDC, it will likely find itself fighting to sell too many HDDs to too few customers. In other words, its pricing and profits will suffer.Only a few Wall Street analysts understand this situation correctly. If you look at the current estimates for STX and WDC, you’ll find a wide gap between the optimistic estimates and the pessimistic ones.For STX, our numbers exceed even the most optimistic Wall Street estimates, which call for $3.50 in EPS for the year ending June 2012 and $5.84 for the year ending June 2013. Conversely, our estimates for WDC are closer to the lowest Wall Street numbers, which call for a $3.27 loss in the year ending June 2012 and a profit of $0.54 for the year ending June 2013.You wouldn’t know it from their respective stock prices. WDC is currently trading in the mid-20s, which is a P/E of 50 based on the low estimate for 2013. Meanwhile, STX is still trading in the teens, with a 2013 P/E of just 3. Indeed, it would seem more appropriate if their stock prices were flip-flopped. That would better reflect the flip-flop that appears to be underway in the long-term competitive landscape.For that reason, we believe that shares of STX are poised to triple from its recent lows.Disclosure: I am long STX.Additional disclosure: I am also short shares of WDC."
306275,24866,2011-11-08T14:14:49-05:00,,"Disk drive-maker Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has taken a bit of a hit over the last five years, but it is, in my view, poised to experience improving market share in the next few quarters. Refreshing new product initiatives coupled with a relatively limited impact from the Thailand flooding puts the company in a favorable competitive position, at least in the short-term. Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) meanwhile has upside with the HGST deal and receives a similar ""buy"" rating on the Street.From a multiples perspective, Seagate is substantially overvalued compared to Western Digital. It trades at a respective 16.5x and 7.5x past and forward earnings; Western Digital trades at a respective 8.6x and 6.5x past and forward earnings. Western Digital also is more liquid with a net cash position of $3.4B, which represents 52.3% of its market capitalization. At the same time, Seagate tends to be seen as the stronger of the two companies and offers a dividend yield of 3.93% while Western Digital offers none.On the most recent first quarter earnings call, Seagate's Chairman & CEO, Steve Luczo, noted corporate challenges:Next quarter shipments can be upwards of 55M units and will likely reverse the trend in gross margins. I am targeting gross margins of at least 23.2% by 2014 given a shift towards less expensive operations and higher prices. While the firm may have lost market share in the first quarter for HDD due to the negative impact of pricing policy, in the long-term, I believe this will pay off as the macroeconomy picks up and technology firms shift to higher quality.Seagate's initiative with 300GB / platter mission-critical also represents a catalyst in the years ahead, as a driver for market share gains. The main issue, again, will be shifting towards higher-growth and higher-margin segments. Towards this end, it is fortunate that the transaction of Samsung's hard drive assets has recently won approval from the European commission. This acquisition will help unlock cost synergies and put the company on a more profitable footing. Normalizing rare earth costs are, however, out of control and causing stability. During the first quarter, they were at upwards of 8x historical norms and efforts to increase prices were admitted by management as being unsuccessful. The high beta of 2.21 coupled with concerns over the sovereign debt crisis and macro stagnation also add to the list of risks.Consensus estimates for EPS are that it will increase by 60.5% to $1.99 in 2012 and then by 34.2% and 13.1% in the next two years. Of the 22 revisions, 16 have been gone up. Assuming a lower multiple of 13 and bearish 2013 EPS of $2.50, the stock's rough intrinsic value could be $32.50. This implies a substantial margin of safety that, in my view, more than justifies the risk inherent in the stock. With management reiterating its commitment to returning free cash flow to shareholders and new products in the mission-critical market to boost demand, I find myself in agreement with the ""buy"" rating on the Street.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The company  shipped 50.7 million units during the first quarter, compared with 52  million units in the year-ago quarter.The company lost 3 percentage points of market share in the September  quarter as the company restrained from participating in aggressive  pricing in the mission-critical market, especially at a time when the  company is looking to evade costs associated with the rare earth  increases.Moreover, the company’s strategy to increase the price of its notebooks  back fired as the demand for the same reduced considerably. Aggressive  pricing in the Asia-Pacific region led to market-share loss, partly  mitigated by market share gains in North America.During the quarter, demand supply agreement and cross licensing  agreements with Samsung have been executed. Moreover, the company also  expects to execute the HDD supply agreement with Samsung in the near  future. This apart, the company will begin the integration of Samsung's  HDD business in March 2012 and expects to complete it by the end of the  calendar year.Operating ResultsGross profit inched down to $549.0 million from $550.0 million in the  prior-year quarter.

309435,23553,2011-11-21T17:26:27-05:00,,"By Gad AllonBusinessweek had an interesting article on the consequences of the  flooding in Thailand for the hard drive industry.  What I found most  interesting is how it highlights different aspects of risk mitigation,  both strategic and tactical ones.The article describes the situation at Seagate (NASDAQ:STX).  Even though  floodwaters that have affected much of the industrial heartland north of  Bangkok for the past six weeks have spared both of Seagate’s Thai  factories, Seagate’s network of supplier is affected:Seagate Chief Executive Officer Stephen J. Luczo is  forecasting difficult times for the drive industry. Each of the hundreds  of thousands of drives Seagate’s Thai factories ship every day contain  parts from 130 or so suppliers, many still under three feet of water.  The projections by some Wall Street analysts that production will be  back to pre-flood levels by summer is nonsense, Luczo believes. “This is  going to take a lot longer than people are assuming, until the end of  2012 at least,” he says. “And by then, demand will have gone up.”When thinking about risk, one usually  separates between likelihoods and consequences. The first question here  is were the risk of floods appropriately evaluated and managed:Few of the companies in this finely tuned supply chain,  lured to Thailand by low wages and government incentives, ever thought  they would need to worry about massive floods. When suspension arm maker  Hutchinson Technology (NASDAQ:HTCH)  opened a plant in the Rajana Industrial Park seven miles from the Chao  Phraya River a year ago, it had no problem getting flood insurance, says  CEO Wayne Fortun. Hours after the levee broke on Oct. 10, his plant was  filled with six feet of water. Employees moved some inventory and  equipment to the second floor, but some $50 million worth of highly  specialized gear remains bolted to the ground.The article points to the fact that the risks were known and that  flood insurance was purchased.  The article mentions loses of the order  of $50 million for one firm, but it is difficult to know whether  the insurance was adequate. Yet, the idea of buying insurance to hedge  against risk is one of several risk mitigation activities a firm can  engage in. In this case, the insurance does not reduce the likelihood of  flood, yet it reduces the consequences once an event occurs.  Clearly  choosing to locate your plant close to the river increases the likelihood  of the flood affecting your plant. I will put that under (lack) of  operational risk mitigation.  As Seagate learned, it is not enough that  your factory operates if your suppliers are under water.   Their CEO mentions that he is thinking about requiring Seagate’s  suppliers to be outside the flood plain, which is again another type of  strategic risk mitigation.Of course, even a firm reduces the impact of risk by reducing the  likelihood of an even, one has to be prepared to its occurrence, and  prepare tactical risk mitigation activities.According to company spokesman Masashiro Nagayasu, they  cut a hole in the roof of the Rajana factory, sent divers into the  toxin-laden waters to unbolt some heavy equipment, and lifted it onto  waiting boats. Some of the equipment is now being used in Nidec  factories in China and the Philippines. “This supply chain has been  calloused and toughened by years of competition,” says John Rydning, an  analyst with market research firm IDC, who said on Nov. 10 that he  believes drive shortages may ease by mid-2012.The ability to take quick actions and recover can make a huge  difference. Sending divers to help in pulling important equipment is a  very good example of such risk recovery.  Several years ago, Procter & Gamble's  Pringles plant in Jackson, Tenn., was hit by a tornado. Even though it  was estimated to be back in production within a month, P&G managed  through a quick response to bring it back to speed within a week.  These  tactical actions are usually part of a larger, broader strategic plan.  As the article suggests, years of tough competition have prepared the  hard drive firms to be agile and respond quickly."

Fourth Quarter Overview The company reported decent fourth quarter 2011 results. Earnings per  share of 28 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents.  Reported earnings, however, were below the year-ago quarter level.Seagate reported revenues of $2.86 billion in the fourth quarter, down  7.9% from $2.65 billion in the year-ago period. The company shipped 52  million disk drives in the reported quarter. In the enterprise market,  Seagate shipped 5.1 million drives for mission-critical applications and  2.7 million drives for business-critical applications, representing  year-over-year increases of 8.0% and 46.0%, respectively.In the fourth quarter of 2011, gross profit decreased to $551.0 million  from $728.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Gross margin was 19.3%  compared with 27.4% in the prior-year quarter. Operating income in the  quarter was $190.0 million or 6.64% of revenues, down 50.0% from 390.0  million or 14.3% of revenues in the year-ago quarter. The decline in  operating income was due to higher operating expenses (up 17.2% year  over year).Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments  totaled approximately $3.15 billion in the reported quarter versus $2.58  billion in the previous quarter. Accounts receivables increased to  $1.49 billion from $1.39 billion in the year-ago period.Agreement of Analysts Out of the 17 analysts providing estimates for the first quarter, four  analysts revised their estimates downward over the last thirty days. Out  of the 16 analysts providing estimates for the next quarter, one  analyst increased the estimate in the last thirty days while three  analysts moved in the opposite direction. For fiscal 2012, six analysts  made downward revisions while none of the analysts moved upward over the  last thirty days.Some analysts believe that that the outlook for the upcoming quarter  was impacted by significant activities including better-than-anticipated  pricing negotiations. Specifically, analysts expect enterprise pricing  to be down 5.0%-7.0% sequentially, notebook to decline 3.0%-5.0%, while  desktop remains flat.Other analysts are of the opinion that STX’s current returns on  enterprise and desktop are improving. However, some customers have  complained of faults in select products shipped 3 years ago. Moreover,  analysts also expect some share loss going forward. Finally, while rare  earth pricing has declined significantly in the previous quarter, it  should still see the full impact of higher prices before some moderation  in the third quarter. In the given circumstances analysts believe the  industry should sustain these higher costs.Some analysts believe that a number of issues will restrain Seagate  from achieving the year-ago gross margin level of 18.9%. For one, rare  earth metal prices have not moderated much and will have a negative  sequential impact. Others believe that yields would not improve much and  may decline further. Mix of enterprise is also likely to be lower than  expected, and utilization will be lower given the sequential decline.  Thus, given all the headwinds, analysts expect the gross margin to  remain flat (versus. 60bp increase previously).Magnitude of Estimate Revisions Since the fourth quarter earnings release, the magnitude of revisions  has been modest. Overall, estimates for the upcoming quarter moved down  to 31 cents from 32 cents in the last 30 days while the same reduced by  12 cents over the past 90 days.For fiscal 2012, estimates have decreased from $1.58 to $1.49 over the  last 30 days.However, estimates have dipped by 12 cents in the last 90  days. For 2012, estimates have gone down from $1.95 to $1.49 over the  last 90 days, while it reduced by 9 cents over the last 30 days.Recommendation We believe that Seagate’s strong foothold in the Enterprise SSD market  will enable it to generate better revenue growth in fiscal 2011 and  beyond, which in turn will drive margins. Improving supply-demand  balance in the HDD industry will also act as a positive catalyst.We also believe that the company’s decision to buyback shares and pay  out dividend will be welcomed by income-seeking investors. But weakness  in the consumer segment, price erosion, rising demand for flash drives  and competitive pressures from Western Digital Corporation (WDC) keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Seagate has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold rating."
282586,21950,2011-07-28T09:54:35-04:00,,"On July 22, I summarized Seagate’s (NASDAQ:STX) earnings commentary partially blaming a “bubble” in rare earth prices for causing a margin squeeze for the company. Seagate management claimed that the soaring prices of rare earth elements (REEs) are very similar to a brief episode of soaring prices of ruthenium back in 2006. The price bubble for ruthenium was quite dramatic. In about a year, ruthenium prices increased about 8x. The Minor Metals Trade Association (MMTA) provides a graph from Johnson Matthey showing the 2006-07 run-up in price:[Click to enlarge]In other words, ruthenium had a brief price spike because one new application caused an unprecedented surge in demand for the metal. Once the materials industry was able to adjust to that demand, prices fell back to historical levels.The current REE crunch was exacerbated by Chinese quotas which are not likely to improve significantly anytime soon. The supply adjustment that the REE industry must make is very significant given entire mines have been restarted and supply chains built and/or rebuilt. This adjustment has been unfolding over several years thanks to companies like Molycorp (MCP), Lynas (OTCPK:LYSCF), and Great Western Mineral (OTC:GWMGF), and it will take several years more – quite unlike the mere months it took to increase ruthenium supplies from mines already in operation with functional supply chains. While this cycle plays out, the demand for REEs will continue to increase across a broad range of applications and products.Seagate appeared very hopeful that the quota situation will turn out to be a quirky aberration and that the supply situation, especially in the United States, will respond just as it did for ruthenium. I do not see the basis for this optimism, and suspect the company is actually rapidly moving to accommodate a prolonged period of higher prices.Finally, note in my previous piece that I made a reference to dysprosium as a likely rare earth used in Seagate’s hard drives. REE expert Gareth Hatch declares this cannot be the case in a technically detailed piece called Seagate, Rare Earths And The Wrong End Of The Stick. Here is the “slam dunk” quote:Disclosure: I am long MCP, OTC:GWMGF."

Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. The performance attributes of disk drives, including their cost effectiveness and high storage capacities have resulted in disk drives being used as the primary medium for storing electronic data.  A broad range of disk drive products are produced that address enterprise applications, where the products are designed for enterprise servers, mainframes and workstations; client compute applications, where the products are designed for desktop and notebook computers; and client non-compute applications, where the products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as digital video recorders (DVRs), personal data backup systems, portable external storage systems and digital media systems. In addition to manufacturing and selling disk drives, Seagate provides data storage services for small- to medium-sized businesses, including online backup, data protection and recovery solutions. The company is nearly debt free. It has $2.2 billion in debt and $1.8 billion in cash equivalents. Revenue has almost doubled in the last 10 years, with half of the revenue coming from Asia, 29% from the U.S. and 21% from EMEA. The stock price in the last 52 weeks has traded between a high of $21.58 and a low of 9.48. It closed last Friday (February 25) at $12.83. Seagate reported quarterly results in December that indicated that the company is still having a tough time. A revenue decrease of 10% and a gross margin decrease from 30% to 19% compared to the same period a year earlier. The total number of units sold was only down 2%. The decreases in revenue reflected the impact of the competitive pricing environment which the industry experienced during the middle of calendar year 2010. The company states the following about this in the quarterly submission:  Let’s take a look at the trend of key financial data over the last 10 years (Data as of end of fiscal year, which ends in June). Graph 1: Financial Trend   We’ll try to get to an estimate of Seagate’s intrinsic value by using the earnings power value method. First, earnings need to be adjusted to represent the cash investors can extract and still leave the company functioning. Second, we need to determine a discount rate. Lastly we’ll estimate the future growth of the companyThe following adjustment will be done on the TTM financials:
EBIT margin of 7.5%
SG&A, R&D, Depreciation adjustment
Tax rate of 37%
Discount rate of 12%
To estimate future growth we’ll take a growth percentage of 5%, cost of capital of 11% and a ROIC of 18%. This gives an intrinsic value of $17 per share. The current stock price of around $12.83 gives a 24% discount to the intrinsic value.   Seagate’s products are currently approaching the end of their life cycle and the company is rolling out a refresh of its product cycle. This should have a positive impact on margins in the second part of this year. Let’s assume that the company is able to restore gross margins to the 22% - 26% range. We’ll recalculate the intrinsic value this time by taking an EBIT margin of 10%. This puts the intrinsic value at $20.50. This would be close to a 40% discount to the last closing price. Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in STX over the next 72 hours."

(NASDAQ:STX)  is scheduled to announce its fourth quarter 2011 results on July 20,  2011 and the modest revision in estimates reflects some key changes in  the company’s future business prospects.Third Quarter Overview The company reported dismal third quarter 2011 results. Earnings per  share (EPS) of 25 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents.  The third quarter earnings were also below the year-ago quarter level.Seagate reported revenue of $2.70 billion in the third quarter, down  11.6% from $3.05 billion in the year-ago period. The quarter’s revenue  was in line with the higher end of the company’s guided range. The  company shipped 49.0 million disk drive units in the third quarter,  compared with 50.3 million units in the year-ago quarter. The decline in  shipments was due to preferential shift toward flash drives from  traditional hard drives.Operating income on a GAAP basis was $179.0 million, down 68.0% from  $560.0 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The GAAP operating  margin was 6.6% compared with 18.4% in the year-ago quarter. Excluding  restructuring charges and amortization of purchased intangible assets,  non-GAAP operating income was $182.0 million, down 68.2% year over year.  Non-GAAP operating margin was 6.8% versus 18.8% in the year-earlier  quarter.Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments  totaled approximately $2.58 billion at the end of the March quarter,  down from $2.91 billion in the previous quarter. Accounts receivables  remained flat sequentially at $1.39 billion and inventories increased  $26.0 million from the previous quarter to $834.0 million.Agreement of Analysts Out of the 29 analysts providing estimates for the third quarter, five  analysts revised their estimates upward over the last thirty days. Out  of the eighteen analysts providing estimates for next quarter, five  analysts increased their estimates in the last thirty days while none  moved in the opposite direction. For fiscal 2011, four analysts made  upward revisions while for fiscal year 2012, 2 analysts made upward  revisions, with two others moving in the opposite direction over the  last 30 days.Some analysts believe that pricing is a real positive factor, with  stability in the channel perhaps spilling over into OEM negotiations for  the next quarter. Pricing has been firm in the channel throughout the  quarter, while price increases have been staggering over the last  several weeks, resulting in flat to slightly up channel pricing on an  absolute basis versus expectation of normal sequential declines. In  addition, it appears that HDD vendors will attempt to stabilize pricing  with OEM customers for the upcoming September quarter. This will likely  ensure that demand forecasts remain in line with expectations.Some analysts believe that by the end of September, TAM is expected to  be roughly 165M with upside possible to 170M if components are  available. Pricing will likely rise for OEMs once again due to  constraints, partly mitigated by stable conditions in the channel.  Moreover, the analysts also expect GM to rise sequentially for STX and  Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).Some analysts also expect the full year HDD between 3-5% compared with  the earlier projection of 7%. Moreover, the Seagateestimates are also  revised for an assumed slower buyback level until the Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) (N/R)  acquisition is completed.Both Seagate and WD announced this week that EU intends to conduct more  in-depth review of their proposed acquisitions of Samsung and HGST. We  note that this was fully expected, and that even with the additional  reviews, the deals remain on track to close by the end of this year.Moreover, the analysts also believe that Seagate’s June quarter will be  strong, with solid upside potential unless any major issues arise in  June . It is expected that Seagate will capitalize on the ongoing  industry consolidation, although there is some fear that Seagate’s free  cash flow potential may be affected post-merger. Some are of the opinion  that Seagate should be able to expand margins and deliver very  attractive ROIC.Magnitude of Estimate Revisions Since the third quarter earnings release, the magnitude of revisions  has been modest. Overall, estimates for the upcoming quarter inched up  to 24 cents from 23 cents in the last 30 days while the Zacks Consensus  Estimate reduced by 4 cents over the past 90 days.For fiscal 2011, estimates have increased from $1.18 to $1.19 over the  last 30 days.However, estimates have dipped by 6 cents in the last 90  days.

281103,21950,2011-07-22T08:45:59-04:00,,"For some time now, rare earth supply, demand, and prices have been hot topics of discussion and debate. While these elements are critical components in many high-tech products, they usually represent a very small part of overall product costs. While the Japanese have clearly been scrambling to reduce their dependence on Chinese exports and to otherwise secure greater supplies, I have never heard a company complain that soaring rare earth prices were materially hurting profit margins, until now.Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), a manufacturer of hard drives and provider of storage solutions, warned during its earnings report on July 20 that rare earth prices are starting to squeeze its profit margins. In particular, soaring prices over the last two months or so have hit the company hard.From the Seeking Alpha transcript of the earnings conference call:Two hundred basis points is significant and material given gross margins of 19.3% last quarter.Historically, Seagate has absorbed increases in the costs of materials, presumably due to the on-going efficiencies in hard drive technology and production processes. Times have changed now with commodity prices, not just rare earths, in a strong, bullish trend:The situation has clearly become critical for Seagate because the company is now trying to figure out how to reduce its consumption of some rare earths in its manufacturing processes as well as how to pass along the increasing costs to its customers through temporary rare earth surcharges. Management admitted that they remain uncertain about their ability to execute price increases. Regardless, the company calls the potential surcharges temporary because of expectations of an imminent resolution to current supply shortages:Interestingly, management seems to believe that U.S. mines alone (Molycorp (MCP)?) will soon solve the problem:Management went so far as to say “…this feels a little bit like a bubble.” Management compared the price run in rare earths to a 6-month run the company experienced in ruthenium prices in 2006. I will need to research more closely what happened at the time to understand the specific similarities to today’s rare earth market. I will post my findings in a future post.Seagate did not call out Dysprosium by name, but this rare earth element must be one of the culprits impacting Seagate’s cost structure. According to management, rare earths are about 2% of the cost of a hard drive because of a magnet and the motor. Dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization and are employed in various data storage applications, such as in hard disks. One quick scan of the related headlines on Asian Metal (registration required) provides confirmation that Dysprosium has experienced a severe squeeze in supply, surge in demand, and strong lift in prices all year. The latest headline from July 21 announces “Dysprosium oxide offer skyrockets in the west” (scroll down for the Dysprosium headlines for the year). Stories like these confirm the strength of the current upward price trends.If Seagate is specifically relying on Molycorp to eventually relieve the supply crunch in the near future, they may be disappointed. On July 11, BBC News quoted Jim Sims from Molycorp claiming that, “as China’s exports are being restricted, we are looking at outright shortages of rare earths, probably this year and next”.Moreover, I have cited other references in a previous post challenging claims that rare earths will be plentiful as early as 2013, titled “Chinese Academic’s Rare Earth Forecasts at Odds With Industry Experts“. In other words, the “bubble” in rare earth prices will likely last a lot longer than consumers like Seagate expect (or at least hope!).Seagate's stock ended the day after earnings down 17%, returning the stock to negative territory on the year. Molycorp MCP soared 7% on the day with most of the gains coming in the final minutes of trading. MCP is up 18% for the year.Be careful out there!Disclosure: I am long MCP."

The company shipped 48.9 million disk drive units in the second quarter, compared to 49.2 units in the previous quarter. The decline was due to slowing demand in the Asia-Pacific distribution channel.

Though the facility is currently unavailable, the fund is expected to provide the company with flexibility to continue with investments in a broad range of storage technologies.Seagate also returns cash to shareholders. In November, the company received the authorization to buy back additional $2.0 billion common shares. During the quarter, Seagate repurchased 21 million shares worth $305.0 million.GuidanceFor the third quarter of 2011, Seagate expects TAM to be between 155 million and 165 million units. Revenue is expected to range between $2.55 billion and $2.7 billion and gross margin to range between 18% and 19%. The guidance reflects less visibility over demand. Moreover, Seagate believes that gross margin would remain under pressure as higher material costs will complement the continuing price erosion.However, management remains somewhat positive about increasing demand for consumer and commercial mass storage as is indicated by introduction of real-time data consuming devices.To ConcludeSeagate posted disappointing second quarter results, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the top line. Additionally, the guidance indicates another sequential downfall.Despite these concerns, we believe that Seagate’s firm footing in the Enterprise SSD market will enable it to generate revenue growth in fiscal 2011 and beyond, which could help grow margins. We also believe that the company’s decision to buy back shares could turn investor sentiment. But weakness in the consumer segment, price erosion, falling demand and competitive pressure from Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Seagate has a short-term Hold rating, as indicated by the Zacks #3 Rank."

Where are investors to turn for filling in the shorter end of their fixed income ladders, while still obtaining yield and staying somewhat liquid in the near term?We highlighted a Seagate issue yielding 6% for 6 years in an August edition of This Week's Best Bond. Upon reviewing the company's earnings release this week, we reviewed this bond issue again and identified a Seagate offering due in October 2011.  The shorter term bond is what many of our clients, who had the same needs that were described above,  were seeking. Step 2 - We like companies that are profitable.Seagate announced earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 on January 19, 2011 and although they were less than anticipated, they were still quite profitable.  Net income was $150 million or $0.33 per share.  Although this is lower than in the past, the important thing to remember is that the company is still profitable and this is impressive given the state of our economy.  We reviewed Blyth (NYSE:BTH) that had   declining profitability, however still had what we consider to be strong operating potential.  Issuers must be profitable to meet our criteria.Seagate generated cash flow from operations of $752 million for the first six months in its 2011 fiscal year. This bond issue is due in October 2011 and has about $560 million of debt outstanding.  If Seagate was able to repeat this level of operating cash flow, it would be able to repay this issue from cash flow alone when it comes due in October.Step 3 - Interest Coverage RatiosSeagate generated $206 million from earnings before interest tax and amortization or EBITA for the quarter recently ended.  The company owed $46 million in interest expense on the debt it has outstanding, meaning it produced four times over its interest costs.  This is a healthy ratio and we like seeing this kind of buffer should the business environment deteriorate.   Step 4 - We like companies with lower debt to cash ratio.Seagate reported long term debt of $2,365 million.  One may include the $560 million labeled as current portion of long term debt, giving a total of $2,925 million.  Cash and short term investments grew from the previous quarter to $2,814 million.  This is due to operating earnings and a bond issue that is described further below.  Long term debt, including the current portion, is slightly higher than cash on hand. This means the company would almost be able to pay off its debt if a catastrophic unforeseen event was to occur. Considering that this note matures in October 2011, one realizes that Seagate currently has enough cash on hand to repay this issue five fold.Step 5 - We like companies that have flexible balance sheetsThe company currently has a market cap of about $6.25 billion, while long term debt is slightly under $3 billion.  A debt to equity ratio of less than .5 is quite attractive.  We have reviewed other U.S. corporate bonds that have a similar debt to equity ratio such as DaVita (NYSE:DVA) that have done well.In December, it announced a $750 million bond offering.  The capital raised in the offering is included in the ratio.  In addition, it has a $350 million line of credit.  Management has purchased equity in the open market to the tune of $305 million or 21 million shares.  Each of these transactions individually would increase the leverage ratio, while both at the same time increase it even further.  These are examples of how the company has rebalanced its leverage ratios by increasing debt and reducing equity.In recent news, Seagate was exploring the possibility of going private.  The price of taking the company private was between $7 and $9 billion, depending on what source one uses.  These figures are what private parties valued the company at, illustrating that the equity may be trading at a discount, thus decreasing the debt to equity ratio further.  Regardless, we like to see lower debt to equity ratios and Seagate has a respectable one.Step 6 - We like high yields.This issue of Seagate currently has a 2.045% yield to maturity with the corresponding U.S. Treasury yielding 0.2%.  Although the credit ratings are different, we believe there should not be this large of a spread between the yields.Step 7- Additional RisksSeagate is the world's largest producer of hard drives.  Revenue has been declining, and management says it may continue, due in part to the soft economic environment.  Seagate's main product, the disc drive, is part of the larger personal computer market. The personal computer market has shown signs such as margin pressures and reduced or declining revenues, indicating that the market may be maturing. Its disk drive growth in ancillary products such as TV recording devices (DVRs), are currently not making up for the decline in personal computers.The smaller hand held or mobile devices market that is showing rapid growth is utilizing a competitive product know as flash memory.  Flash memory is more expensive, however offers users mobility which is important for consumers. In general, technology companies compete in a very competitive, ever-changing environment.  There are constant upgrades and new products that compete in the market place.SummaryThis is a good yield given the 10 month time frame. Even though it doesn't have an investment grade rating, a large cash position, strong free cash flow, and profitability illustrates the relative health of the company over the near term.  These metrics are similar to US Corporate Bonds we have highlighted in the past including Blyth and Unitrin (UTR). Delivering profit soon after a tremendous shock to the markets and economy helps demonstrate the strength of the company's business model.  With the lower debt level and good profitability, the company is well situated considering its rating.

286001,24199,2011-08-09T13:25:33-04:00,,"I like the hard drive manufacturing industry for a few reasons. First, the industry is becoming more concentrated. Two years ago, it was dominated by five firms that were locked in heated competition. Today? Thanks to consolidation, just three. Higher concentration is terrible for consumers, but great for investors. In an industry like this which sells commoditized products, intense competition leads to the erosion of margins (and thus returns) far more quickly than in other industries. So industry consolidation should be beneficial for investors in the long run as competitive pressure abates.Second, analysts in this industry are excessively focused on the next quarter. Though it is generally the case that analysts are performance myopic, in this industry they are exceptionally so. This leads to analyst overreaction which translates nicely to Mr. Market overreaction.Here’s a good example: In July 2010, Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC) reported its Q4 and full year earnings. In response four firms reduced their targets, and did so by an average of 18.2%. The company’s shares fell 13% over the next three days. Today, the same firms have targets that are above their original targets from last year. This is common – targets fluctuate all over the place. This happens because excessively complex models give the illusion of accuracy, yet slight changes in inputs each quarter result in highly volatile outputs. This might make sense for extremely short-term investors (though I doubt it), but it frequently creates opportunities for long-term value investors that don’t suffer from performance myopia. A single bad quarter can send shares spiraling downward (like in WDC’s case), only to recover (and then some!) a quarter or two later. Investors in July 2010 who held until the company released its earnings in April (and analysts raised their targets again) were rewarded with a gain greater than 50%.Let’s turn to Seagate Technology plc (NASDAQ:STX). In July, the company issued its 3Q 2011 earnings. Mr. Market was unimpressed, and sent STX shares down 16.83% the next day. STX was on my watchlist so I decided to take a closer look.First, the company’s returns:Historically, the company has earned strong returns, hovering around 20% and above. The massive drop in 2009 was largely the result of a $2.3 billion write-down in Goodwill, a non-cash charge that was a common occurrence at the time as companies took “big baths” in the depths of the recession (when bearish sentiment was at its max, the rationale is that it won’t get much worse, so it is the best time to do a mea culpa).Let’s look at the company’s free cash flows:Capital expenditures are the difference between cash flows from operations (the green bars) and free cash flows (the blue bars), and the rather large and persistent difference shown in this chart, suggests the company operates in a fairly capital intensive industry. The ratio of free cash flows to net income is also persistently below 1.0, which is likely the result of the company’s continued growth (sales more than doubled from 2002 to 2008) rather than a financial shenanigan (I would be worried if this ratio was persistently below 1.0 for a mature company in a mature industry).One thing I like about the company is that, like Dell Inc (DELL-OLD), the company has an impressive cash conversion cycle which can be a source of competitive advantage.One area of concern is that the company has a hefty debt load.As you can see, the company also carries a large amount of cash. While most focus on the net of the two (“net debt”), I would rather the company use the cash to pay down the debt. From my perspective, the cash can quickly disappear via a variety of transactions, leaving the investor with a suddenly over-leveraged company.This concern might be particularly relevant for STX because it has been actively spending cash to repurchase its own shares. The company has spent $710 million in the last two quarters and $1,294 million over the last five quarters doing this. At the same time, the company issued $1,323 million in long-term debt. I know a lot of investors are pushing for this right now (“issue debt at historically low rates and repurchase shares that are generating returns in excess of the cost of debt”), but I am not a fan. Increased debt leads to increased risk, and I don’t care much for returns that improve due solely to balance sheet management. I am a fan of share repurchases, but not when debt levels are high and certainly not when the repurchases are financed with increased debt!Given the increased risk that I see in the company, I demand a larger margin of safety than I normally would. In valuing STX, I used a variety of revenue scenarios and historical margins to create a range of estimated intrinsic value. Though I found STX to be undervalued, I do not believe there is a large enough margin of safety (especially in relation to my bearish scenarios which show a sizable downside) to justify a purchase. However, if the company once again trades in the low $12′s (on a per share basis, which it did as recently as March), I would be very interested (especially if they reduce their debt levels).What do you think about Seagate?Disclosure: No position."
247098,21863,2011-01-18T12:56:02-05:00,,"As a value investor, volatility is your friend. It can offer you great opportunities to buy when prices are low and equally great opportunities to sell when they are high. For whatever reason, some value stocks are more volatile than others. For example, LCA-Vision (NASDAQ:LCAV) is a stock that has offered investors plenty of entry and exit points over the last two years. Another volatile stock with value potential appears to be Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).Seagate designs and manufactures hard disk drives. These devices are currently incorporated into pretty much all servers, desktops, and laptops. Seagate's market share is about 30%, as it sold nearly 50 million hard drives last quarter. The company is pretty much debt free (it has almost as much cash as it has debt), and only once over the last business cycle has its annual operating margin fallen below 5.5%.
Despite the apparent stability of the business however, Seagate's stock price fluctuates wildly. In just the last two years, Seagate's stock price has gone from $23 to $3, back up to $21 and back down to $10. How can a company with low debt levels and a history of consistent profits lose 80% of its value and gain 600% of its value when its business hasn't really changed much?
It appears that the market is overly fixated on short-term outlooks in this particular industry. Only a few months ago, we saw how analysts were intensely focused on the short-term outlook for one of Seagate's competitors, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).
There are a couple of risks in this industry of which value investors should take note. Operating in a field where technological change can render companies obsolete over the course of just a few years, Seagate's future viability is somewhat uncertain. There are other devices with the potential to usurp the capabilities of hard disk drives, but currently such devices are too costly to take over the market. That could change.
Furthermore, the hard drive industry is somewhat ""commoditized."" If a competitor expands too quickly, prices for all disk drives fall. This means that to a large extent, Seagate does not control its own destiny. It also means that management must be on the ball, as the company must be a low cost operator to be successful.
Seagate reports its earnings tomorrow afternoon. If it disappoints in some way, a volatile stock such as this one could fall dramatically. Investors who are well-prepared beforehand could benefit in such a situation, as we saw with Kirkland's after its latest quarterly report.Disclosure: No position"
231647,20568,2010-10-22T07:34:59-04:00,,"Seagate Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:STX) reported first quarter fiscal 2011 earnings per share of 37 cents, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents. Revenue of $2.69 billion also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.75 billion.RevenueSeagate reported revenue of $2.69 billion in the first quarter, up 1.3% from $2.66 billion in the year-ago period. The quarter’s revenue came in below the guided range of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. The company shipped 49.2 million disk drive units in the first quarter, representing a 5.12% sequential growth fueled by a moderate hard drive demand.The company witnessed weakness in consumer markets especially in the United States and in Europe early in the quarter. This weakness led to a reduction in the total available market to approximately 165 million units, which was at the low end of the company’s expectation. However, Seagate is experiencing an improvement in consumer activity. Moreover, pricing remained aggressive across all product lines, customers and geographic regions, which impacted both the top and bottom line numbers.Operating ResultsGross margin in the first quarter went down to 20.4% from 27.4% in the previous quarter. Gross margin was below the target range of 22% to 26% due to the aforementioned factors and a higher cost structure.Operating income was $231.0 million, up 4.5% from $221.0 million reported in the year-ago quarter. GAAP operating margin was 8.6% in the first quarter, compared to 8.3% in the year-ago quarter. The improvement in operating results was driven by higher revenue, offset by a slight increase in operating expenses.On a GAAP basis, net income was $149.0 million or 31 cents per share, down from $179.0 million or 35 cents per share in the comparable quarter last year. Excluding the impact of purchased intangible amortization expense, restructuring charges, amortization of purchased intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets and an income tax benefit, adjusted net income was $180.0 million or 37 cents per share.Balance Sheet, Cash Flow & Share RepurchaseCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2.17 billion at the end of the October quarter, down from $2.63 billion in the previous quarter. The company generated operating cash flows of $245.0 million during the quarter and exited the quarter with a total debt balance of $2.17 billion.In ConclusionSeagate is slated to launch some important products by the end of calendar year 2010. Moreover, the company stated that it has successfully entered the Enterprise SSD market with its innovative storage products. The launch of the new products is expected to beef up its existing portfolio and boost revenue growth in fiscal 2011 and beyond.We consider the improvement in its enterprise business line to be a positive for Seagate. However, the company’s European exposure and recent weakness in the consumer segment are worrying. Hence we have a short-term strong Sell rating on the shares, as indicated by the Zacks #5 Rank."
230809,23469,2010-10-19T09:44:28-04:00,,"Short Sale of the Day: Seagate Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:STX)Analysis: As I was looking through companies yesterday, I came across something I very rarely ever see … a company with an RSI above 80. 80 and 20 are the extreme benchmarks on the RSI technical scale. As a company nears 80, it is becoming well overvalued. As a company nears 20, it way too undervalued. Above 80 means a company has made such a quick move to the upside that it may be due for a pullback. That company was Seagate Technology.The company has shot up over 30% in the past two trading days. The main reason behind the push was news that the company may get a major private buyout deal in the future. Analysts estimate that buyout could be between $15 - $18. The stock soared Friday and again yesterday, nearing $16. Today’s weakness in the tech sector is about to challenge the stock and bring about a chance for some major profit taking.While the news was very promising for Seagate Tech, a pullback from such RSI levels is definitely expected. Even above 70 on RSI is a redflag that a short should be in order because a stock cannot maintain that sort of momentum. Overvaluation means that a large group of people were demanding something over supplying it. As the price of the stock rises with that demand, the demand will eventually wane at certain levels or with new developments. Once the demand drops, supply will most likely rise or stay the same, creating the drop in price.STX, this morning, is about to get hit with a major tech pullback on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) earnings. The stock could see a large drop in share price, and it has already dropped 1.5% in pre-market trading. The stock’s upper bollinger band, even with the movement, has only made it to the high 14s. The stock’s fast stochastics are over 100. The RSI finished the day at 82.5. Everything is pointing towards pullback. While the news is still relevant, the stock will see more supply than demand today. A push back upwards will be expected on the next big tech day.For today, STX, though, is a prime short sale candidate. Watch for a Morning Levels alert to get the exact entry range.Disclosure: No position"
220582,23899,2010-08-15T09:18:27-04:00,,"Bearish comments from analysts at JP Morgan and Robert W. Baird last week regarding tech spending have put an already-weak sector under even greater pressure. Major tech names like Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) and Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) are retreating from recent gains and some tech stocks are quickly falling into the abyss.   On Tuesday, shares of Applied Materials (Nasdaq: AMAT), Seagate Technology (NYSE: STX), and Symantec (Nasdaq: SYMC) all hit 52-week lows. For existing shareholders, it's fair to wonder if it's time to cut their losses. And for investors that have avoided this sector as it has tumbled, do these newly-cheapened stocks signal it's time to jump in? Let's take a look...  Applied Materials One of the key challenges for all tech stocks involves the steep peaks and dips in revenue and profit streams. With such robust swings, investors always apply relatively low multiples. In the area of semiconductors, investors are often even more wary, as capital spending cycles enter into boom and bust cycles with alarming frequency. Applied Materials, for example, saw sales plunge -38% in fiscal (October) 2009, yet is in the midst of a fresh growth spurt this year that should boost sales +70% to +80%.   But fear springs eternal for this sector, and investors are already bracing for the next plunge. Perhaps that fear is quite premature. After all, capital spending for advanced semiconductor equipment -- for which Applied Materials is the acknowledged global leader -- is often a function of the cash customers have at their disposal. Right now, Applied Materials' customers are fattening their balance sheets again after a string of solid results from chip makers.  Looking ahead, analysts still think Applied Materials will see sales grow in fiscal (October) 2011, perhaps in the +10% to 20% range. That may prove to be optimistic or pessimistic, but one thing is for sure: the company generates loads of cash in good times or bad. Sure, it lost $235 million in free cash flow in 2009, but it generated $6.7 billion in positive free cash flow during the previous five years. It would take an absolute plunge in global chip equipment spending for Applied Materials to move back into the red in terms of free cash flow.  In a bid to please investors, Applied Materials recently shut down its money-losing SunFab unit that makes thin-film solar panels. That move is expected to boost profits and once again tighten the company's core focus on the semiconductor business (although it will retain some exposure to the solar industry). That move should allow gross margins to rise back up next year into the mid 40% range from a current 39%, according to Needham & Co. Operating margins should also rebound back into the low 20% range. Yet shares have moved even lower since that July 21st announcement and are now at levels last seen in 2003 (excepting the early 2009 swoon which cratered many stocks).   Assuming sales rise at a moderate pace in 2011, as analysts currently expect, then free cash flow could approach $1.5 billion -- roughly in line with what Applied Materials generated in 2006 and 2007. Back then, shares traded in a range of $15 to $25 -- well above the current price near $11.15.  As is the case with many tech stocks these days, Applied Materials can only rely on one catalyst to support shares: stock buybacks. The company's share count has already shrunk from 1.7 billion shares in 2004 to a recent 1.34 billion. The company could continue buying back 100 million shares annually without cutting into R&D spending or its $3 billion in cash and investments.   Applied Materials is expected to report third quarter results next Wednesday, August 18th. Management noted in July that the quarter was faring well, and if recent quarterly conference calls are any guide, management should again speak of a still-rising backlog of orders. Perhaps that will be what it takes to get shares out of the summer doldrums.  Seagate Technology This hard-disk drive maker is also a victim of lousy sentiment toward the entire industry. Those bearish comments noted earlier from JP Morgan and Robert W. Baird specifically cited concerns about a slowdown in spending on PCs and servers. Seagate, which has exposure to both volume and pricing (both metrics are good when demand is strong, and bad when they're not) surely can post erratic numbers. When business was lousy in fiscal (June) 2009, the company barely broke even in terms of free cash flow. Yet in the fiscal year just ended, free cash flow surged to more than $1 billion. But the recent quarterly results also highlighted an emerging slowdown in demand, thanks in large part to cautious spending trends in Europe.  Yet even as sales weaken a bit, Seagate remains highly profitable. Analysts had been expecting EPS in the $3.60 range for both fiscal 2011 and 2012, but thanks to the incipient slowdown, have lowered those forecasts by a little more than a dollar to about $2.40. Seagate's shares trade for less than five times those lowered 2011 and 2012 profit projections.   To be sure, few positive catalysts exist in the near-term, so this stock is of much greater appeal to deep value investors than growth investors. Yet if the economy does begin to turn around, Seagate is a very high beta stock and could quickly double from current levels. Right now, few are envisioning such a scenario, as evidenced by Tuesday's new yearly low.  Symantec This security software maker has been in the doghouse ever since it acquired computer storage firm Veritas in 2005 for more than $13 billion. Investors didn't see the synergies of the deal back then, and they still don't. Adding insult, results at both of these disparate divisions began to lag their respective rivals, perhaps due to management's lost focus.  Even as organic growth has been lacking, Symantec has been a free cash flow machine, routinely spitting out about $1.4 billion in free cash flow, year after year. To boost growth, the company has put that prodigious cash flow back into play, recently acquiring a security software division from Verisign (Nasdaq: VRSN) for $1.3 billion. At least this deal has real synergies.  Symantec's ever-sinking stock is the result of tepid guidance issued in late July making clear that key customers were taking a longer time to commit to big new contracts. Like Seagate, Symantec has become a company with dim top-line prospects, but still-robust bottom-line prospects. And in this market, that trade-off holds little appeal.Interested investors may want to check out Applied Materials' conference call next Wednesday to get the latest outlook on this seemingly moribund sector.   Applied Materials is the healthiest among these three stocks, though with shares trading for a little over 15 times projected profits, it lacks the absolute rock-bottom valuations seen with Seagate (4.5) and Symantec (9.6). All three of these companies are either first or second in the industries they operate and should rise anew when investors rotate back into the tech sector."
222197,23599,2010-08-25T09:26:41-04:00,,"Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX) designs, develops, markets and manufactures solutions for hard data storage.  Their product line includes disc drives and hard drives for desktop and  laptop computers, mobile computing, digital video recording (DVR),  gaming counsels and data storage for customers buying for private  personal use to large corporate applications. At  Durig Capital we have developed a process to review, select, purchase  and monitor corporate bonds on an ongoing basis. Enclosed is our review,  along with supporting documents, showing why we believe this corporate  bond makes sense in clients' portfolios. We reviewed thousands of  separate corporate bond listings to find what, we believe, is currently  the best corporate bond for investors. The following includes our  selection criteria.Step 1 - Yield Curve at 4-7 Years Out.We  like this time frame because we think it is the “sweet spot” of the  yield curve meaning we are frustrated with the virtually non existent  short term money market, CD, and T bill yields and nervous about  inflation effecting long term principal.  This Seagate issue matures in  six years.  Principal reduction is a real risk attributable to inflation  and to protect our client in this worst case scenario we would just  plan to hold to maturity.Step 2 - We like companies that are profitable.For  the last quarter, net income attributable to shareholders was $378  million, or $.77 a share.  While these numbers are down over the  previous quarter, their yearly net income and earning per share numbers  have shown steady improvement over the last four years, an $1,609  million in net income meaning a $3.29 earnings per share.  The hard  drive market is a mature industry as evident in the decline in the byte  per dollar rate but as technology develops into faster, smaller and  mobile devices there will be a constant need for data storage. Seagate  generated free cash flow to firm of $836 million in the last fiscal  year ending July 2, 2010.  The rough economy for the last has been very  challenging for Seagate and business in general, but Seagate still  generated enough cash flow in 2010 to be able to pay off 38% of their  entire principal debt.  This is very strong position knowing the overall  economy. Step 3 - We like companies with lower debt to cash ratio.Seagate  Technologies' current long term debt is $2,173 million while having cash  and short term investments of $2,515 million. If Seagate applied its  current cash and short term investments to its current long term debt,  their long term debt could be repaid. Their current balance sheet can be  viewed here. With  the combination of high cash flow, plus high levels of cash, Seagate has  two simple ways to cover most of their outstanding debt obligations. Step 4 - We like companies that have flexible balance sheets.Seagate  Technologies' debt to equity ratio is 29% illustrating that, if it  needed, they could float more common shares or issue debt to raise  capital.  At Durig Capital, we like debt to equity ratios around these  levels as it gives the issuer options if additional capital were needed.  Having financial flexibility in these uncertain economic times is  important as one bump in Seagate’s business plan should not derail the  locomotive. Step 5 - We like high yields.Seagate  Technologies’ bonds currently have a 6.147% yield. With the  corresponding Treasury yielding 2.07%, this gives Seagate an attractive  4.077% spread over Treasuries.Step 6 - We currently like shorter maturities.This  issue matures in 10/01/2016 or just under six years.  As stated above,  we seek issues that mature in 4 to 8 years as this is the part of the  yield curve we want to be invested in.SummaryThis  is a good 6.147% yield for just over 6 years. Even though it doesn't  have an investment grade rating, a large cash position, investment  coverage and profitability illustrates the relative health of the  company.  These metrics are similar to our previous bond reports such as  Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Interpublic (NYSE:IPG), Unitrin (UTR), and Fidelity.  Delivering profit soon after a tremendous shock to the markets and  economy helps demonstrate the strength of their business model.  With  the low debt level and good profitability, they are well situated for an  upgraded bond rating.

215502,21523,2010-07-21T01:26:30-04:00,,"Think back a decade ago to mid-2000. The average person probably owned a single desktop computer and accessed the Internet through AOL (NYSE:AOL) dial-up. Few people bought products on-line. Nearly everyone still purchased CDs to own music and VHS tapes to own movies (DVD did not outsell VHS until 2001). Film cameras were found in 90% of homes while digital cameras had only penetrated 10%. Digital cameras still took relatively small, low-quality photos - 3 megapixels was state-of-the-art at the time. Digital video was barely even being used in Hollywood, let alone in the hands of consumers.Most computer files were small, text-based word processing or spreadsheet documents that could easily be backed up onto floppy drives, Zip drives, or CD-ROM disks. Back in 2000, the largest hard drives you could find were about 80 gigabytes (GB) in size, and most computers had disk drives in the 20-40 GB range.My, how things have changed today! Many people now own several computers. Music distribution has shifted sharply towards digital downloads, with Napster's MP3 sharing service beginning the process and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iTunes legitimizing it to the point where Apple is now the #1 music retailer worldwide. Digital distribution of movies has been slower, but streaming video from sources like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is coming on strong. Digital cameras have completely wiped out film at the consumer level, and almost at the professional level. The newest smartphones are capable of shooting high definition digital video. All of these mediums take up incredible amounts of storage space, both locally and in the ""cloud"", where people upload their media to sharing services like Youtube (NASDAQ:GOOG), Flickr (YHOO), and Facebook. Not to mention maintaining backups on their external hard drive in case the computer goes belly up!To really draw the point out, hard drives have also found their way into all kinds of new applications. Do you have a DVR? That has a hard drive. An Xbox 360 (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Playstation 3 (NYSE:SNE)? They have hard drives. A lot of scan/fax printers have hard drives. Many businesses now use network-connected hard drives instead of extra server machines for storage needs.With this incredible expansion of the market over the past 10 years, things continue to look bright for drive makers. In particular, the move towards ""cloud computing"", where media and data is stored on server farms and streamed to any device, is a huge win for the drive makers over the solid-state ""flash"" drives that so many feared would replace them. On the other hand, proliferation of digital video and ever-larger megapixel sizes for cameras ensure that hard drives will continue to fill up.Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) is the market leader, selling more hard drives than anyone else, although only slightly more than sworn enemy Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). With new management, an improving balance sheet, and the winds of organic growth behind them, Seagate looks like a solid Magic Formula investment today. MagicDiligence has a ""buy"" opinion.The bulk of the story here is industry related. In addition to the growth trajectory, the dynamics on both the supplier and customer side has improved for the better over the last several years. Traditionally, the hard drive industry has been a difficult investment. Drives use standardized connectors, making them essentially commodities. Product cycles are very short, and prices are volatile and forever falling (to the tune of about 10% a year). There were nearly a dozen drive makers, but few PC manufacturers to sell them to.Today, after consolidation and rationalization, only 5 global hard drive makers remain: Seagate, Western Digital, Hitachi (HIT), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). Amongst these, Seagate and WD comprise over 60% of the market. Fewer suppliers helps keep pricing rational, limiting the risk of destructive price wars.On the other side, the customer roster has expanded as well. Disk drives demand has grown faster than PC demand due to their numerous new applications. As a result, Seagate no longer just sells to a few PC OEMs like Dell (NYSE:DELL) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), but also to distributors, retailers, and ""newer"" OEMs like network storage giant EMC (EMC). While customer concentration remains a concern (70% from OEM customers alone), the trend is in the right direction.Seagate has a dominant share (65%) of the enterprise hard drive market. Enterprise drives are optimized for speed and reliability, and are higher margin products than consumer devices. Enterprise drives are a key component of the cloud computing trend. However, the company will have to fend off new competition from Western Digital, which entered this market earlier this year.The business trends for Seagate are improving. Strong results over the past 9 months have allowed Seagate to improve its balance sheet to the point where it now holds more cash ($2.3 billion) than debt ($2.0 billion). New management has focused on reducing the cost structure, a key in a cyclical industry such as this. They have succeeded, too - operating costs have been reduced by 23% from 2008 levels. These changes should make Seagate more competitive with WDC going forward, after losing 5 points of market share in the past 5 years.Finally, the near-term industry outlook is strong. PC shipments grew over 20% in Q2 of this year. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) just reported a blowout quarter, further evidence that businesses and consumers are buying computers again. While analysts have recently ratcheted down expectations for the drive makers, they may have been too aggressive. In any case, Seagate's 23% forward MFI-adjusted earnings yield is well below its long-term average of about 12%.Seagate looks like an acceptable buy at current levels, with a ""sell early"" target price of $22.Disclosure: Steve owns WDC"

Meanwhile, Seagate said it has raised $430 million in a private bond offering that will pay all or some of its $300 million in debt that’s due Oct. 1. The moves answer two key questions that have been swirling around Seagate:First the demand picture. Seagate’s said it in a statement that it will ship 39 million units in its March quarter out of an estimated 110-112 million unit market. Demand for Seagate’s 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch ATA products topped internal estimates. Seagate said that enterprise market fell 20 percent in the March quarter compared to the December quarter. Product mix favored lower capacity desktop and notebook drives. The company said that gross margins will be between 7 percent to 7.5 percent, a tally that was better than projected, but well off the December quarter. Seagate CEO Steve Luczo said the company is “realigning our business processes and optimizing our product portfolio to maximize profitability.”For Seagate’s fiscal fourth quarter ending June 30, the company projected revenue of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $1.86 billion. Seagate said the total addressable market for enterprise drives will be flat with the March quarter. The company added that it plans to cut costs further, but didn’t offer details. As for liquidity concerns, Seagate earlier this month altered the covenants on its credit facility to gain more wiggle room. That amendment coupled with its planned capital raise should give Seagate a cushion for the future quarters. Wall Street is expecting Seagate to lose money for at least the next three quarters."

Higher volume sales and cost controls has helped the disk drive maker earn at least 7% gross margins for the quarter, better than earlier estimates, according to the company's management. Cash increased $200 million to about $1.5 billion. Product development and marketing and administrative costs are expected to be $380 million, below the originally projected $395 million.As a result, the company expects unit shipments in the quarter of 39 million, with a total market of 110 million to 112 million units. STX's unit demand for 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch ATA drives was better than planned; the company also said it gained significant share in those areas. That said, the company now expects to post revenue for its 3rd fiscal quarter ended April 3 of 2.1 billion-- which is ahead of its previous forecast of 1.6 billion to 2 billion.On the other hand, the company said the market for enterprise class products fell about 20% sequentially. However, skeptics should realize that all major enterprise companies (EMC, NTAP, etc.) have all been hit by the economy. They all have announced bad numbers, layoffs, etc,. The only thing they did the last quarter was burn off inventory. Customers are not canceling orders, they are simply deferring their orders. Otherwise, there is a huge pent up demand for storage that will soon explode, and when it does, STX will be rewarded significantly. The scenario occurring right now is a pent up demand for capacity, not speed. Hence, customers are not clamoring for SSDs, they want capacity (hard drives).Aside from improved fundamentals, the technical view is also bullish for STX. See the chart below. Short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term views all indicate a ""buy"". The 5.80 is a solid support level for STX. The shares have closed above the pivotal point of 6.85-- a very healthy sign. If we can breach through the resistance of 7.80 on heavy volume, more capital will flow into the stock.Other bullish indicators are the following:Based on the above technical and quantitative indicators, I recommend the following strategy for new entries.Assuming the shares open at 6.88 on Monday, the May strike 6 at 1.10/contract look attractive. If you write these calls against the underlying shares, you will be granted .43/contract. That is 430 dollars per 1000 underlying shares. The May strike 7 are also offering .50/contract, but only write those calls if you feel the overall market will continue to hold its rally.

STX generates half of its sales in the Asia Pacific region, 26% in North America, and 24% in Europe.Desktop storage drives accounted for half of fiscal Q2 unit volume. They include the Barracuda and DiamondMax product families of 3.5-inch drives with up to 2.0 terabytes (TB) of capacity delivered at up to 7,200 RPM. Mobile computing drives, sold under the Momentus brand name, accounted for 30% of unit volume. They are designed for notebook computers, tablet computers, and digital audio devices. They have up to 640 gigabytes (GB) of memory capacity and speeds of up to 7,200 RPM. Enterprise storage products were responsible for 9% of unit volume. They include 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch drives with up to 2.0 TB of memory and speeds up to 15,000 RPM. Product families include Pulsar, Savvio, Cheetah, Constellation, and Barracuda.Finally, drives for consumer electronics produced 11% of unit volume. These drives are installed in digital video recorders, video game consoles, home electronic entertainment devices, and other consumer products.STX also sells branded external backup storage devices, which are marketed under the Free Agent and Maxtor OneTouch brands.Original equipment manufacturers generated 64% of fiscal 2009 net sales. Distributors and retailers accounted for 27% and 9%, respectively.Demand for data storage hardware has been robust as more consumers create, share, and store increasingly rich digital content such as digital photographs, music, videos, and other multimedia files. The expanding availability of broadband Internet and increased emphasis on backing up data are also fueling demand. HDD volumes were historically tied to personal computer sales. More recently, demand is being driven by consumer electronic devices.The recession led to a dip in demand, an oversupply of product, and falling prices. The subsequent inventory correction resulted in supply shortages and a swift rebound in prices. These price increases along with cost cuts and a recent rebound in demand produced stellar profits. Fiscal Q2 net sales jumped 33.3% yearover-year to $3.03 billion. STX shipped 49.9 million units, up 35.8%. The gross profit margin surged to 30.49% from just 13.92% a year earlier. Pro forma net income was $543 million or $1.05 per share, easily beating the consensus estimate. GAAP net income was $533 million or $1.03 per share.Investment risks include the weak economic climate and further deterioration in consumer and business spending trends, an oversupply of product due to improper demand forecasts, and the increasing popularity of solid state drives (SSDs). However, because SSDs, are significantly more expensive than hard disk drives they are not likely to pose a serious challenge in the near term.Gross margins in fiscal Q3 and Q4 may fall from the fiscal Q2 level, but the full year figure should surpass management’s 22-26% target. The company is forecasting $2.9-3.1 billion in net sales for fiscal Q3 and 90-94 cents in per share earnings. Long-term prospects are attractive as digital content grows in popularity and broadband Internet connectivity expands."
114249,20307,2009-01-11T13:06:38-05:00,,"Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) CEO Bill Watkins told Tech Trader Daily on Friday that December was “just terrible” in terms of disk-drive demand, due in part to a sharp drop in distribution channel inventories. Watkins said channel inventories for disk drives are the lowest he has ever seen, as low as four weeks, and notes that distributors are having trouble getting credit.Watkins notes that the company will announce a restructuring sometime this month which will likely result in a reduction in production capacity and significant layoffs. The company currently has about 50,000 employees worldwide; it’s not hard to imagine there will be thousands job cuts.On December 10, the company cut its Q4 revenue forecast to a range of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, down from previous guidance of $2.85 billion to $3.05 billion. But Watkins says that demand in the final month of the year was even worse that he thought.Meanwhile, Watkins says he continues to expect substantial consolidation in the industry, with Fujitsu shopping its drive business, and head-maker TDK this week announcing a large loss and substantial layoffs. He thinks the industry will eventually boil down to four players: Seagate, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Hitachi and one other player from Japan, perhaps some combination of TDK, Fujistu’s drive business and Toshiba. (He adds that Samsung also “can stay in the game and keep losing money.”)However, Watkins said Seagate is not going to buy any rivals. “There is nothing I can do that would make any sense to me,” he says."

The bad news: Seagate is lagging with its product line–especially for notebook drives–and that’s killing margins and hurting profits in the current quarter.For the quarter ended June 27, Seagate reported earnings of 37 cents a share, excluding items. That’s six cents below Wall Street estimates. But the outlook was the real kick in the teeth. Seagate projected first quarter earnings of 22 cents a share to 26 cents a share. The problem: Wall Street was expecting 58 cents a share.Needless to say Seagate shares got a good whack after hours. So what’s the problem? Seagate’s product execution hasn’t been so hot and instead of leading it has been following. The company’s conference call (see transcript) delivered the following takeaways.Seagate lost its first mover advantage on drives. CEO Bill Watkins said:Seagate thinks it has a fix and the economy isn’t the issue. Officials said demand in the enterprise is strong, consumer electronics is doing well and HD products are promising. Eric Savitz at Barrons has more on Seagate’s corrective measures.The problem is that Seagate is lagging on notebook drives. For instance, Seagate’s operating chief David A. Wickersham said:For the notebook market, the ramp of the 250-gig notebook drive has been completed and our participation in the 250-gigabyte capacity point in the June quarter was reflective of our overall notebook market share.Simply put, Seagate’s rivals have beat it to the punch in the fastest growing part of the PC market. Take a commodity market, products that are second movers and you get squeezed hard."

Revenues came in below our previous expectations on lower shipments as strength in notebook units was more than offset by deterioration in 3.5” demand. Aggressive cuts in opex as well as lower taxes allowed the company to surpass our previous earnings estimates even with lower gross margins. As we previewed, a combination of deteriorating demand and falling pricing is expected to lead to a revenue decline in December.However with units and gross margins below our previous expectations, the company’s forecasts for revenue of $2.85B - $3.05B and earnings of $0.19 - $0.23 are both below are lowered numbers. The HDD makers including Seagate are now trading at multiples that previously have been associated with the threat of bankruptcy. Seagate is still operating at profitable levels.In addition we see a strong likelihood for both consolidation and competitive disruption within the next 6 months, which creates potential for ASP stabilization even in a deteriorating market. As such, we are retaining our positive view on the name, even though we see little prospect for better end market demand conditions in the next 6 months.Finally, we would note that Seagate lowered planned capex for 2009 to $750M, down from previous expectations of $1B.

114171,22542,2009-01-11T06:09:43-05:00,,"How big is your computer’s hard drive? I’ll bet dollars to doughnuts it’s a heck of a lot larger than it was 10 years ago.Our data storage needs have changed substantially over the last decade. In the mid 1990s, your copy of Windows 95 took up a whopping 50 megabytes of storage space ­– today, an install of Windows Vista requires a minimum of 15 gigabytes.And our appetite for hard drive space isn’t getting filled anytime soon. According to a recent article from computer website X-bit Labs, “Worldwide [hard drive] shipments are expected to grow in 2008, even in the face of economic uncertainty in the United States, and increase at a compound annual growth rate of more than 9% between 2007 and 2012.”It’s no wonder why storage space is such a hot commodity… we live in the time of TiVo and the iPod. It’s surprising how many consumer electronics devices are equipped with hard drives for storage – from video game consoles to cars, everything seems to be popping up with a hard disk drive (HDD) installed these days.Even hard drive veterans like computers saw their capacities increase throughout 2008. According to that same X-bit Labs article, “…worldwide disk storage systems capacity shipments will continue to more than double every two years, growing at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 53% from 2007 to 2012, while spending will pass the $34 billion mark in 2012.”Part of this demand is fueled by software applications that require hefty amounts of storage to run. Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) consumer video editor, iMovie, uses uncompressed video that rings in at 25 megabits per seconds, meaning that an hour of video rings in at just under 12 gigabytes – no small chunk of space.The same is true for the enterprise market. Hulu is an online service that lets users watch their favorite TV shows and movies online for free – many in HD. You’d better believe that the storage requirements for a service like that to run are staggering. Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the same boat – as of this writing, the company’s free Gmail e-mail service offers 7,282 megabytes of free storage space per user.With demand as strong as ever, now’s not a bad time to be a hard drive manufacturer.The Best Hard Drive CompanyThere’s no shortage of competition in the hard drive arena. While companies like Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Xyratex (NASDAQ:XRTX), and SanDisk (SNDK) have been successful in bringing profits to their investors in the last few years, none have the bargain appeal of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).Seagate is the world’s largest manufacturer of hard drives and data storage devices. The company sells its storage products to customers in every segment of the market (including consumer, OEM, and enterprise) under the Seagate and Maxtor brand names.In the last year, the company took in more than $1.2 billion in income – a 38% increase over 2007 – but until now investors haven't been interested. As of this writing, the company’s market cap is a scant $2.7 billion. That’s an obscenely low valuation for a company that generated as much cash at STX did in 2008.Looking at Seagate’s ValueFrom a fundamental standpoint, there’s no question that Seagate is a cheap company right now. STX has a P/E ratio of 3.07 – significantly shy of the industry average 7.88. Price to book stands at 0.54, suggesting that Seagate’s money-making assets are currently up for grabs for almost half of what they’re worth.Imagine if you could pay a one-time fee of $100 today to get $32 of cash each and every year for the foreseeable future. With a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 3.11, that’s essentially what’s going on with Seagate. For comparison’s sake, the average S&P 500 stock costs 15 times as much for the same amount of cash generating ability.Right now, the Seagate has a strong balance sheet with $1.2 billion in cash and very few intangibles on the books. And with a current debt load of $2 billion, Seagate’s ability to cover its expenses isn’t a concern despite the state of the economy. The company’s current financial health puts it in a good position to handle whatever hurdles may lay ahead in 2009.Growth is key for a company like STX. Even though Seagate controls a large portion of the hard drive market (35% in 2007), the company has been able to deliver strong top line growth over the past few years; since 2005, sales have grown 68%.That’s not to say that STX isn’t without its detractors. Heavy competition among hard drive manufacturers is a big concern for the company. With increasing operating costs serving as one of the main reasons Seagate’s margins contracted somewhat in its most recent quarter, cutting costs will have to be a top priority for the company to keep its current market stature.Likewise, pushes toward new technologies could be another challenge for the company. With solid state drives (SSDs) like those found in the MacBook Air becoming more prevalent, Seagate needs to embrace a sales strategy that can promote SSDs alongside the traditional hard disk drives that are Seagate’s bread and butter.So far, it looks like the company is up to the challenge. In a recent article on Cnet.com, Rich Vignes, senior manager of market development explained: “Our history is based on rotating magnetic media. But as solid-state comes online, we're embracing this new media type.”The Bottom LineSeagate Technology is a phenomenal value opportunity right now. The Rhino Stock Report model portfolio took its position at $4.53 in a Rhino Alert sent out to BETA subscribers on December 18, 2008. As of this writing, the stock is trading at $5.59, a price that still warrants a “BUY” rating from us.STX could comfortably climb above the $10 range by 2010. I think that company EPS projections of $0.12 are reasonable given the current economic climate, and could increase substantially once increased consumer confidence translates into more sales.Disclosure: STX is a long position in the Rhino Stock Report’s model portfolio."

Its GAAP net income was $355 million, and diluted net income per share was $0.64. Seagate has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share. It bought back 10.3 million of its common shares for approximately $250 million. Under the current stock repurchase program, it is authorized to buy approximately $725 million worth of more shares. With strong demand driving the disc drive industry, Seagate maintained its number one positions in the Enterprise, Desktop, and Consumer Electronics markets. Disc drive unit shipments were 47 million, up 21% y-o-y and 20% q-o-q. In the Enterprise market, it shipped 4.6 million units. It has extended its hardware based full-disk encryption technology to its enterprise products. In the Consumer Electronics market, it shipped 5.7 million units, driven primarily by shipments into gaming applications and DVRs (which grew 35% y-o-y). In the mobile compute market, Seagate shipped a record 7.9 million units, which is up 87% y-o-y. In the desktop market, it shipped 29 millions units, up 22% sequentially. For the second quarter, Seagate expects revenue in the range of $3.4 to $3.5 billion and GAAP diluted net income per share between $0.66 and $0.70. Seagate has recently announced its plans to acquire MetaLINCS, a technology leader in the fast-growing E-Discovery market. Following this, its CEO William D. Watkins and Chairman Stephen J.

The company's market cap is around $14 billion. I will maintain my bullish rating of the company, and fully expect it to continue being a beneficiary of the online video boom. In fact, since the market is being skittish again, this is a good stock to keep an eye on to buy at a good price and then hold for a while. The advent of IPTV could put a lot of throttle into this market as well, as the hard drive needs of the set-top boxes which permit movie/video download rise exponentially."

The growing online video trend and the increasing popularity of YouTube and the likes is a major driving force for the increasing demand for massive amounts of hard drive storage. All the videos that get downloaded or uploaded need to get stored somewhere, right? In this post, I will analyze Seagate as an online video beneficiary.Seagate Technology (NYSE: STX) is a leader in the design, manufacturing and marketing of rigid disc drives. Based in California, it has 54,000 employees, of which 43,000 employees are located in its Asian operations. It has around 3,857 U.S. patents and 761 foreign patents. Seagate acquired Maxtor in May 2006 and EVault in January 2007. The disc drive industry is undergoing consolidation with TDK acquiring Alps and Western Digital acquiring Komag in 2007. Seagate produces a wide range of disc drive products that address enterprise, mobile computing, desktop, consumer electronics and branded solutions markets. Most of its products are based on perpendicular recording technology and it has recently announced its plans to introduce solid state drive [SSD] products for select markets. Seagate’s Momentus® 5400 FDE.2 laptop disc drive with built in Advanced Encryption Standard [AES] encryption chip built was in July certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST] — a first for any hard drive maker.On the financial front, Seagate reported revenue of $11.4 billion for fiscal year 2007 that ended on June 29th. This was an increase of 23% over $9.2 billion in fiscal year 2006. The Maxtor acquisition was a major factor in this increase in revenue despite a 9% reduction in the average sales price from $78 to $71 per unit. GAAP net income was $913 million and diluted net income per share was $1.56. HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell (NYSE:DELL) are its major customers accounting for 16% and 9% of consolidated revenue, respectively in fiscal 2007. For Q4 2007, it reported revenue of $2.74 billion, GAAP net income of $541 million, and diluted net income per share of $0.96.For the September quarter, Seagate expects to earn between $.057 and $0.61 a share, on revenue in a range of $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion. (It had earlier estimated revenue of $2.9 - $3.0 billion, and GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.35 - $0.39.) Its stock is currently trading around $26 and its market cap is $13.79 billion. Seagate will be announcing Q108 results on Oct 16, 2007,Both the overall storage market and Seagate as a company have a lot of momentum, but the stock seems cheap. The disc drive industry is projected to exceed $30 billion and 550 million units annually by 2008, according to Gartner Research, up from $21.4 billion in 2004. Seagate holds the #1 position in overall market share, and the #1 spot in 3 of the 4 key markets, including Consumer Electronics, Enterprise and Desktop computing.

In an interview with Tech Trader Daily on the floor of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas just a week before the company is due to report earnings, Watkins noted that the company continues to reiterate its previous guidance. He says Seagate is not seeing the slowdown that people think is happening, and that Seagate is not seeing slowing business in Europe or Asia. Watkins says he continues to see double-digit growth in drives in both notebooks and desktops.I asked Watkins why the stock continues to trade at such a modest multiple - under 10x EPS estimates for the June 2008 fiscal year. He says there are two reasons. One, concerns that drive demand could be cannibalized by flash memory devices, and two, “they are are scared to death we are going to have a price war.” He notes that the March quarter last year was “a disaster” in terms of pricing.” For now, he says, Seagate is anticipating the quarter will show year-over-year growth in the March quarter. “It is not about volume,” he says. “It is about behavior. Last year in the March quarter our unit growth was wiped away with a price war. It is about discipline and how you price.”As for the flash memory issue, he concerns are ebbing as people figure out that drives are still much cheaper than Flash based storage. But he also says that this is not a religious war for the company: Watkins says the company will in fact offer flash drives this year for enterprise applications.For the long haul, Watkins thinks storage demand will get a significant push from surveillance and security applications. On the surveillance side, he notes that there are more and more cameras in public places; he thinks there is an opportunity to offer storage for those systems. On the security side, he thinks there will be greater demand for encrypted storage.Mark Jourlait, VP for global marketing at Seagate, notes that the company is unveiling several key new products at CES. For starters, they are showing Black Armor, the company’s first 2.5-inch external drive with full 128-bit encryption. The idea is, if you unplug the disk from your computer, the data can’t be retrieved without knowledge of the password. (Forget the password, and you are hosed.)In its booth, Seagate is also showing a number of companies making use of Seagate’s DAVE portable storage product. The idea is that you can backup information from cell phones, high-def video cameras and other devices onto a WiFi- or Bluetooth-connected drive."

The consensus estimate is 42c for EPS and $2.89B for revenue, according to First Call. On the company's Q3 earnings call management provided Q4 guidance below consensus. The company guided to Q4 EPS of 41c to 45c.Thomas Weisel, following checks with STX competitors, channel partners, and PC ODMs, is incrementally more positive on the HDD industry, including Seagate. The firm's more positive view heading into the seasonally strong September and December quarter is based on checks that suggest HDD unit demand and pricing appears to be tracking above increasingly bearish sentiment. As such, Weisel expects an in-line rather than disappointing results when Seagate reports. Additionally, Weisel's checks with Taiwanese ODMs indicate that demand for HDDs will remain in-line with a seasonal up-tick for the September quarter while pricing will remain within seasonal trends of up 1% QoQ to down 4% QoQ. As such, they remain comfortable with their September quarter estimates of $3.21B (down 2% YoY, up 12% QoQ) and 61c (consensus estimates are $3.23B and 58c). Wachovia expects in-line desktop and enterprise demand for the quarter. The firm believes the most meaningful potential concern will be that Seagate does not reduce its inventory as much as some investors would like -- the company reported a 29% sequential increase during Q3 of $1.073B, in which finished goods rose 47% sequentially. Wachovia estimates approximately $990M exiting Q4. Key issues for the call: Share repurchase plan, Seagate has a $2.2B authorization exiting March, implications for the model as Seagate enters into the enterprise SSDs space in 2009; CapEx guidance, consensus is flat to down YoY; and signs that Seagate-specific problems in its notebook segment are being resolved."

fourth quarter. Watkins noted in an interview with Tech Trader Daily Tuesday afternoon that the company sold 29 million drives in the September
quarter, up from 24 million in the June quarter; he says capacity
constraints will limit growth to 4%-5% sequentially in the December
quarter. He notes that the company has orders for the quarter of 6
million to 7 million units above current capacity. Says Watkins: “I
have tons of orders I can’t fill.”As noted, the company reported better-than-expected results for the quarter.On
the other hand, Watkins says the company has no current plans to add
capacity, which should come as a relief to long time investors in this
sector, which has a history of expanding too rapidly, over and over
again. Watkins says the company will sit down in March to evaluate its
capacity needs for next fall. Meanwhile, he does say the company is
adding substrate capacity at a facility in Malaysia, but that the goal
is to reduce component costs, not to add overall drive capacity. Watkins
says third quarter results included 87% year-over-year growth in drives
for notebooks, versus 27% for the overall drive sector. He says the
industry as a whole grew shipments 19% sequentially in the third
quarter, to more than 132 million drives. He notes that drives for
desktop PCs were “a lot stronger” than the company had expected going
into the quarter.Watkins notes that Seagate sold 1.5 million 750 GB drives in the quarter, versus none last year.Watkins

ASPs down a little over 4%. “A very normal quarter,” he says, but one

That’s great for Seagate. For the PC buyer the news may not be so hot.After market close Tuesday, storage giant Seagate said it expects revenue of $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion and net earnings of 57 cents a share to 61 cents a share. Excluding charges, Seagate expects earnings to be about 62 cents a share to 66 cents a share. Seagate had been projecting earnings of 40 cents a share to 44 cents a share excluding charges on revenue of $2.9 billion to $3 billion. Net earnings including charges were projected to be 35 cents a share to 39 cents a share. These projections were just made a little more than a month ago and analysts were expecting first quarter earnings of 43 cents a share. So what changed?The company noted the following:In a nutshell, Seagate is benefiting from stronger than expected PC sales, better pricing and higher margin products. The big takeaway appears to be strong PC sales, which account for 75 percent of Seagate’s total units, according to Robert Baird analyst Daniel Renouard. Renouard adds that Seagate is benefiting from mobile computer sales as well as higher capacity drives. He expects Seagate to continue to perform well given its relatively low inventory and “tight industry supply.” These factors also bode well for Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). Add these items up and you get a picture of PC components that’s much tighter than it was just a few months ago. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Dell (NYSE:DELL) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) have all benefited from lower component costs of late. HP’s most recent quarter was stellar. Apple has indicated that it expects component prices to rise. In the end, these costs may be passed along to you.

Previously, the company had forecast revenue of $2.9 billion to $3 billion, and EPS of 35-39 cents a share GAAP, and 40-44 cents non-GAAP. Seagate says the higher forecast reflects industry unit demand at the high end of the predicted range, “favorable pricing…reflecting a more balanced supply and demand environment,” and a better product mix. The company said it expects gross margin for the quarter of 24%. Stating the obvious, the company also warned that “actual results during the balance of the quarter will heavily influence the company’s financial performance for the quarter.” Yup, I would have a hard time arguing with that.

He notes that some of his rivals have been behaving in a self-destructive fashion in an effort to keep up market share.
“I’ve watched competitors tear their margin profiles apart in a year with phenomenal unit growth,” Watkins said in a Thursday afternoon interview with Tech Trader Daily. 
Watkins says demand looks strong: he sees 15% sequential growth in units in the September quarter, with 10% growth in desktop units, and 20% for laptops. He says PC demand “looks real good,” and that demand for drives for digital video records “is picking up again.”
To deal with the ongoing pricing pressure, he notes, Seagate has cut its break-even point from 17% gross margins to 12.5% - and he says there may be another point or two to squeeze out. Meanwhile, Watkins says that the first three weeks of the quarter “look very strong,” with pricing “more benign that we discussed on the [conference] call.” He says the Street could decide that his guidance is too conservative.

Seagate CEO Bill Watkins has just announced that his company is changing their policy on company guidance. I have written before that financial guidance is very overrated. Many companies have abandoned giving guidance completely (kudos to them) and others have at least stopped giving quarterly projections. So, I was expecting STX to either cease quarterly guidance and give only annual projections, or to halt guidance completely. Wrong on both counts! Seagate will now give only quarterly guidance. Are they kidding? The whole point of stopping quarterly guidance is to focus management on the long term and not put them in a situation where they might take actions just to hit a number in the short term. Now they are embracing three-month projections? I understand them not wanting to give out annual projections. The disk drive business is very hard to predict, as it is largely a commoditized market. Supply and demand, and therefore pricing, is tough to gauge over long periods of time. Essentially, STX management is saying they have no idea what they will earn in fiscal 2008 (which began on July 1st). If you are going to ditch giving guidance, then stop giving guidance! It seems very strange that they say they are focused on the long term, but yet are still going to predict sales and profits every three months. They should have just stopped guidance altogether.

He points to a DigiTimes story (apparently now only available to members of the site) which said that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may hold off on plans for a flash-based video iPod due to concerns that the product would not be competitive. Miller’s basic take is that while flash memory has become cheaper, magnetic media will have the pricing edge for quite some time to come. “Even with a 50% rate of price decline in subsequent years, our projections indicate that flash memory will increase the cost of a laptop PC with a standard amount of memory, i.e., 200GB, by 35%-40% in 2010,” he writes.

32733,20307,2007-04-18T15:22:45-04:00,,"Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) CEO Bill Watkins, in an interview late yesterday with Tech Trader Daily, blamed the company’s weak first quarter report and disappointing guidance on a price war in high-end desktop disk drives. Yesterday, the company announced disappointing third quarter results and a weaker-than-expected outlook for the fourth quarter. Watkins said the company came into the first quarter with a plan that proved a little off. He said it knew notebook pricing would be “pretty aggressive,” and he says it actually ended up taking about a point of market share in notebooks. He says the enterprise business came in “as advertised,"" with the exception of drives for DVRs, which were slower than expected. Where the company was surprised was in 3.5 inch ATA drives: it had anticipated selling 116 million, but the total was only 111 million to 112 million, Watkins says, down from 119 million to 120 million in the December quarter. The weaker demand “created a phenomenal price war” in 400-750 GB drives, he says, eroding prices twice as much as the company had thought. Watkins says the company opted not to be as aggressive on price as it could have; he says the company could have generated more revenue if had further trimmed priced on high end drives, but decided instead to back off, “take our medicine, and bring numbers down.” Watkins says some PC makers may have pushed out production of some desktop models in March in anticipation of price cuts from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) in April. He also said some people had anticipated a build up in demand from the arrival of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows Vista “which didn’t materialize.” Watkins says June also “looks rocky,” but that “September and December look strong to us.” He says desktop demand in June looks “fairly flat, or even down a little bit.” Watkins says the company is looking to tighten costs where it can; he declined to give any specifics on possible headcount reductions, although he did say that with the September quarter looking like it will be up 15% year-over-year in units (with revenue up at least half that), deep cuts wouldn’t make sense. Says Watkins: Seagate today is down $1.76 at $20.39."
29752,20307,2007-03-16T02:14:44-04:00,,"If you are an investor in disk drive stocks, you might be a little anxious about all this discussion about parts of the drive market being replaced with NAND Flash based memory. Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) CEO Bill Watkins would suggest you calm yourself down. I had an illuminating conversation with Watkins yesterday, and let me tell you right now, he’s a lot less worried about this than some people on the Street seem to be. Watkins thinks investors are “missing the whole point.” Flash and hard drives are “synergistic,” he says. The big driver for the data storage market, he says, is the ongoing shift of information - video, music, data - from physical distribution to digital distribution. “It’s all enabled by storage,” he says. Someone has a video on a server. They back it up. Someone downloads it to their PC. They back it up. They move a copy to their portable device. Every piece of content keeps replicating, and in every instance creates a need for storage. And Watkins thinks most of that storage is going to be fulfilled by hard drives. This is not to say that Watkins does not see a role for Flash. He does. It makes sense for devices where the amount of required storage is relatively low - like MP3 players. And he says Seagate and other companies are moving aggressively to create hybrid drives with some attached flash, speeding up the transfer of data, and allowing computers to boot faster. He says the first hybrid drives should be in PCs by the end of the year; eventually, he says, all drives are likely to include 4 GB of Flash, give or take a few gig.    Watkins doesn’t find it very likely, though, that Flash is going to wholesale replace drives in notebooks any time soon. He notes that the smallest drive he sells for notebooks is 80 GB; it sells for about $60. Flash, he says, is selling for about $5 a gig. So if you want 60 GB of flash, it will run you about $300. The overall point, he says, is that “the cost per GB is so overpowering for hard disks.” True, he says, flash uses a little less power. But he says most of the power requirements in a notebook involve the screen, not the drive. And by adding some Flash memory on the drive, he says, you can eliminate that advantage. He also plays down any advantage that Flash might have in durability; drop a laptop or MP3 player, he says, and the biggest danger is not the drive, but a broken screen or keyboard. He also takes issue with the idea that Flash is more reliable: he contends that over time, the ability of flash to read and write erodes. A solid-state drive with regular use - the way you might use a laptop - wouldn’t last much more than a year, he contends. Watkins also likes to point out that some of the biggest makers of Flash memory - Samsung, Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF), Hitachi (HIT) - all also have big bets on hard drives as well. As for whether Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will introduce Flash-based iPods, Watkins says he would not surprised to see it announce a 16 GB Flash model. But he also thinks it won’t happen unless it can find a Flash provider willing to take a loss; the alternative is a price point that might not be appealing to consumers. Watkins wonders whether people will be willing to pay more for an iPod with a 16 GB Flash drive than they would for one with an 80 GB hard drive. He also points out that if you tried to download a high-def video onto a device with only 16 GB of storage, you would quickly fill it up. As for solid-state based notebooks, Watkins says it is certainly feasible that for some applications - particularly where users are relying on data stored on the network - that someone might want one. But again, he wonders if many people will want to pay an extra $300 or so for a laptop with 32 GB of flash, rather 80 GB or 160 GB of hard drive storage. Are disk drives dead? Not yet.

32620,20321,2007-04-18T03:57:34-04:00,,"A lot of readers have been asking me lately about my backup strategy and I'd like to make a super important point yet again. We simply cannot talk about the importance of photo back up enough. At this point there is simply no reason not to have a strong backup strategy in place - and yet when I talk to some of the most talented photographers that I know I find that their work, as often as not, is not backed up. I'm not sure if it is because photographers are more creative types and would rather focus on fun things like actually taking pictures vs. dealing with icky boring things like back up, but it is simply imperative and terribly important.   750 Gigabytes of Goodness, Hosted on Zooomr All of my own photos are backed up at present. I have over 5.5 terabytes of personal storage. This sounds like a lot, but do you know how cheap personal storage has become? Right now at Amazon.com (sold out at B&H Photo) you can get a Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) 750 GB external hard drive (Seagate as photographed above) for $259. 3 years ago this would have been unthinkable. This is the best value per GB that I think I've ever seen. Even with very large 20MB huge RAW files from a 5D, a 750GB drive like this will hold over 38,000 photos. Most people don't have 38,000 photos so a drive like this is more than enough. In fact, I'd recommend that you actually buy two of them - use one as a constant back up at home, and use the other for remote storage. This can be kept at your office, or at a friend's house. In my case I keep a backup copy of all of my finished photographs on a hard drive at my parents' house down in Los Angeles as well. Every time I visit I bring my current back up and swap it out for the old one. This way I've got three copies of all of my finished photos and one of them is remote. Earlier this year my parents' garage burned down. I'm glad their house didn't burn down as well, but fires happen, which is why an offsite drive makes sense to duplicate your back up efforts. I have three of these Seagate drives and love them. I highly recommend them (disclosure: Seagate does sponsor the Photowalking show that I do with Robert Scoble and gave me a free one once, but I'd already been a happy user of the two that I bought for myself). I've tried many different hard drives, Maxtor, Cobra (NASDAQ:COBR), Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) LaCie (LaCies are the worst) and Seagate's have always performed the best for me. The hard drive you have your photos on now *will* fail. Guaranteed. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. So do yourself a favor and if your work is not backed up, start backing it up. Some have said, well, why not just DVDs. I personally don't like this strategy because it's too much of a pain and because of that it doesn't end up getting done as often as it should. With an external hard drive it's portable and you can just drag and drop whenever you want to back things up. I organize my photos by day, so I can just drag over each day's photos onto a back up drive. Consider this blog post your public service announcement for the day. If you don't have a back up drive, go buy one - NOW!"
22836,20307,2006-12-21T06:03:47-05:00,,"Disk-drive maker Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has agreed to pay $185 million in cash to acquire privately held EVault Inc., an Emeryville, California company that provides online backup services to small and medium-sized businesses.
Brian Dexheimer, Seagate’s chief sales and marketing officer, said in an interview today that small companies are facing an increasing need to meet complex government rules for maintaining information. He says the company plans to target small and medium-sized businesses specifically, rather than large enterprises, where similar services are provided by companies like Sungard and Iron Mountain. Nor are the company's offerings targeted at consumers.
Dexheimer says he thinks the market is worth around $1 billion a year, and growing “rapidly.”
Dexheimer says the deal should not be material to earnings. While he did not provide details on EVault’s financial performance, he notes that eVault has been profitable as a stand-alone company. Dexheimer says the deal should close within 60 days.
Seagate on Wednesday closed at $26.90, up 8 cents."
23463,20106,2007-01-04T08:57:57-05:00,,"As my life has become increasingly digitized, I’ve found an almost never-ending need for more and more storage capacity. Luckily, not only have prices continued to fall over the last few years, but storage capacity has increased as well. No one knows what the future might hold in terms of storage needs, but iTWire is reporting that Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) is planning to be in front of it and will eventually be offering a 300 TB (yes, that’s terabytes!) hard drive by 2010. In order to beef up the capacity from their current hard drive offerings, Seagate will be using heat-assisted magnetic recording technology to increase storage yields. While a 300 TB drive would be undeniably cool, I can’t help but wonder whether or not 300 TBs might be a bit of an overkill. Even if you were using the drive to store high definition content, you could still record television 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, using both HDTV tuners on a series 3 TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO) for over two years before you’d run out of storage capacity.    At this point in my life, I’m pretty satisfied with the amount of storage that I have access to, so it’s hard for me to see how useful an industrial capacity drive like this might be. With 1.5 TBs dedicated to music and photos and another 750GBs dedicated to high def television content, I feel like I have enough storage to last me for wherever the future takes me. At the same time though, it’s hard to know what the future holds when it comes to technology. When I first started digitizing my music collection, I never thought that I’d need more than 100GBs, yet after just a couple of CD ripping sessions, I quickly realized that I was going to need substantially more storage capacity. While 300 TBs seems like a bit of an overkill right now, in retrospect, it was only just a few years ago that Maxtor (MXO) was making history by offering a “whopping 100GB” drive that was really just two 50GB drives packaged together.

24923,20181,2007-01-24T06:59:35-05:00,,"Seagate Technology reported after yesterday's close that its FY 2Q07 profits dropped by 51% over the prior-year period, largely the result of costs stemming from its acquisition of rival Maxtor Corp. On a positive note, the U.S.'s largest producer of disk drives raised its guidance for the next quarter and beyond. By the numbers, net income fell to $140 million, good for EPS of $0.23, versus earnings of $287 million, or EPS of $0.57 in the year-earlier period. Excluding one-time items, EPS was $0.39 topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of $0.32. Revenue rose 30% in the quarter to $3 billion, beating the $2.95 billion estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Looking ahead, Seagate forecast FY 3Q07 EPS of between $0.49 and $0.53 on revenue of $2.9 to $3 billion. Excluding one-time costs, profit will be $0.56 to $0.60 a share.

29094,20307,2007-03-09T03:37:53-05:00,,"Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) shares have sold off lately on fears that the company’s entry into the 1.8-inch disk-drive market (a size used in MP3 players) will be squashed before it even gets started by new competition from increasingly cheap NAND flash memory. But those fears could be a wee bit overblown. Matthew Kather, an analyst at W.R. Hambrecht, yesterday advised investors to take advantage of the recent slide and buy the shares. Kather notes that investors knocked $1 billion in market cap off of Seagate’s shares last Friday alone, as investors “assumed that not only will Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) likely not choose Seagate as a new dual supplier in future high-end iPods (they are not in now and have nothing assumed in guidance), but that [hard drives] in all portable handhelds will be eliminated very quickly.” Kather does think that the drop in NAND will speed up the use of flash-based storage, and says a 16 GB flash-based iPod could be viable this year. But he notes that hard-drives still have a cost advantage, and says “the migration to 100% flash will take time.” Writes Kather: “We believe that investors should be buying STX on the large pullback, because the 1.8-inch drive is a small program for Seagate, it is not dead-on-arrival even without Apple (which could still happen) and the “pull-in” of NAND-based devices will not affect our estimates.” Kather maintains a Buy rating and $36 price target on the stock.

24964,20307,2007-01-24T05:25:40-05:00,,"It was a nice fiscal second quarter for Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). The disk-drive maker reported revenue of $3 billion for the quarter ended December 29, slightly ahead of the Street consensus of $2.93 billion; non-GAAP net income per share came in at 39 cents a share, well above the expected 32 cents a share. The company said the solid results reflected “better than expected desktop pricing during the quarter,” among other factors. For the March quarter, the company sees revenue of $2.9 billion to $3 billion, with pro forma profits of 56-60 cents a share; the Street has been at $2.89 billion and 53 cents. For fiscal 2007 ending in June, Seagate sees revenue of $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion, and pro forma net income of $1.70-$1.75 a share; that compared with Street estimates of $11.5 billion and $1.67 a share. The company also said it is “on a path to further increase profitability in the traditionally slower back half of the year.” The company also said it bought back 23 million shares in the fourth quarter, and has since bought back another 13 million shares.

19169,20364,2006-10-25T04:44:51-04:00,,"Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) shares are rising after the company beat sales and profit estimates for the quarter but suggested results for the December quarter will be lower than analysts were expecting. (Just as American Technology Research’s Shaw Wu said they might earlier today.)
But Seagate implied the worst is over in the disk drive price wars.
Sales of $2.8 billion and profit per share of 23 cents, excluding charges taken to acquire disk drive maker Maxtor, exceeded the $2.73 billion and 17 cents consensus estimate of analysts.
The forecast for sales of $2.8 to $3 billion in the current quarter, and profit of as much as 34 cents was indeed below expectations of $3.07 billion and 41 cents, as Wu suggested, but the forecast for the full year 2006 is more or less in line with analysts expectations at $11.8 billion in sales and $1.80 in profit per share (even though it’s way down from the $12.3 billion top end forecast back in August.) 
And, hey, it’s only the first quarter — Seagate has time to turn things around!  
Or at least that’s what the company’s saying.  Yes, it’s true, as Eric has chronicled, that there has been a vicious price war in data storage products, but things are going to get better the next three quarters, management said in its press release:
And just in case you have a hard time swallowing the line that the worst is behind the company, Seagate raised its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share from 8 cents.  There you go.

As of December 31, 2018, the company had a collection of more than 2 million day-by-day case-based blogs which it refers to as Beauty Diaries.The firm divides its revenue segments into two:According to a 2018 market research report by HKTDC, the total cosmetics market in China was valued at $19.95 billion in 2012 and had grown to $37.43 billion in 2017, representing a CAGR of 13.4% between 2012 and 2017.The main factor driving market growth is the rapid economic development in China of a consumer base with greater disposable income during the forecast period.SY’s topline revenue by quarter has grown significantly in the past five-quarter period, as the chart shows below:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Gross profit by quarter has also increased materially:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Operating income by quarter has been somewhat uneven, but still positive in recent reporting periods:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Earnings per share (Diluted) has remained steady in recent quarters:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Since its IPO, SY’s stock price has dropped 53 percent vs. the U.S. Interactive Media and Services index’ fall of 16.4 percent and the overall U.S. market’s drop of 17.8 percent, as the chart below indicates:(Source: Simply Wall Street)So-Young has reported three quarter’s results since going public and the firm exceed analyst consensus in two of the three quarters, as the chart shows below:Revenue and gross profit had shown a strong ramp through September 30, 2019, although in Q3 2019 management missed analyst's EPS expectations.I suspect Q4 2019 and Q1 2020’s results will be more negative, with Q1 2020’s results downright terrible as the coronavirus outbreak halted demand for aesthetic treatments in China.In its last earnings call for calendar Q3 2019, management highlighted the growth of its average mobile MAUs (monthly active users) increasing 144% and total number of purchasing users growing 60%, both over the same quarter in 2018.Perhaps most importantly, the quarter produced a 75% increase in facilitated medical aesthetic transaction value, reaching RMB976 million ($143.5 million)Interested investors should be very cautious with So-Young’s next report, which will probably include no financial impact from the coronavirus outbreak.With the sharp Q1 2020 economic drop so far in China, at most management will only refer to it in passing in their upcoming release on Q4 2019.The firm’s balance sheet appears strong, with $386.9 million in cash and short-term investments as of September 30, 2019. Total liabilities were only $81 million with no long-term debt.After SY gets through reporting the next two quarters (Q4 19 and Q1 20), the firm and stock may be poised for a bounce-back.While my current bias on the stock is Neutral, I’m watch-listing SY for a potential closer look in six months."

In addition, large money manager Apax holds a large stake in the company. This fact should be sufficient to attract the attention of growth investors. On the top of it, value investors should also appreciate the company as it reported positive and growing CFO and FCF in 2018. With other e-commerce platforms trading at 0.5x-6.5x forward sales, So-Young International should trade at more than 6.5x forward sales as its revenue growth and growth profit margin are larger than that of competitors. Having mentioned these positive facts, investors should also be aware that So-Young International is expected to be a controlled company and is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. As a result, minority shareholders would not be as protected as in the United States.Source: ProspectusSource: ProspectusBased in Beijing, China, So-Young International Inc. uses an online platform to provide information about products and services on the Chinese medical aesthetics market.The business model is divided into three segments. One component offers professional content and distributes it through social media. In addition, So-Young International offers a social community where users can upload content. Finally, the company also provides online reservation services for medical aesthetic treatment.So-Young International casts its online platform as the number 1 online destination for assessing, evaluating and reserving medical aesthetic services in China. Some of the figures given in the prospectus are impressive. The company notes that the website receives 240 million average monthly views. In addition, Frost & Sullivan notes that the aggregate value of transactions in 2018 was $306 million, 33.1% of the total value of transactions in the medical aesthetics market in China.The most important aspect is the way the company obtains revenues. According to the prospectus, in 2018, information service fees was reported to be 67% of the total amount of revenues, and service fees charged to medical aesthetic service providers represented 33% of the total amount of revenues.The market opportunity is large and growing at a fast pace. Frost & Sullivan notes that the medical aesthetic services industry reached $17.7 billion in 2018 and could reach $52.4 billion by 2023. The market size should grow at a CAGR of 24.2% from 2018 to 2023, which is very appealing. Keep in mind that even if the management does not perform, market growth should enhance the company’s revenue growth in the coming years.As of December 31, 2018, with an asset/liability ratio of 4.4x, $175 million in cash and term deposits, the company’s financial situation is very stable. In addition, 90% of the total amount of assets is comprised of cash and short-term investments. So-Young International reports a large amount of liquidity, which should please IPO investors. The image below provides a list of assets:Source: ProspectusOn the liabilities front, it seems ideal that the company does not report large financial debt. Only $0.135 million due to related parties may be considered as debt. The table below provides further details on the liabilities reported in the IPO materials:Source: ProspectusA list of contractual obligations is also shown below. Note that the company reports operation lease obligations of only RMB 267 million or $39.8 million. With $175 million in cash and term deposits, analysts should not fear these obligations. The company has sufficient liquidity to pay them:Source: ProspectusAs of December 31, 2018, So-Young International reported revenue growth of 138% y/y, which should impress IPO investors. The gross profit margin is also appealing. With revenue of $89 million, So-Young International reports a gross profit of $76.4 million.With that said, the income from operations is not that large. As of December 31, 2018, the company reported income from operations worth $7.14 million. In 2018, So-Young International spent a total of $44 million in sales and marketing expenses. As of today, the company needs to advertise quite a bit to generate sales. This may change in the future. The image below provides the top of the P&L:Source: ProspectusSo-Young International Inc. should not only be see interest from growth investors but also please value investors as it is generating positive CFO and FCF. As of December 31, 2018, CFO was equal to $28 million and FCF was equal to approximately the same figure. It is also quite convenient that the CFO increased by 119% in 2018. Additionally, in 2016, the CFO was negative. The image below provides the cash flow statement reported for the IPO:Source: ProspectusThe market should appreciate the use of proceeds. The company does not expect to use the money from the IPO to acquire shares from existing shareholders or to pay the debt. As shown in the lines below, the proceeds will be used to invest in R&D, brand promotion, content offering and other purposes:Source: ProspectusThe list of shareholders reveals that one shareholder owns a significant amount of class B shares, which gives this individual control of the entity.With that said, there are several well-known private equities owning large stakes. Youthful Acquisition L.P. is controlled by a large fund called Apax, which has raised $51 billion since 1981. In addition, there is Orchid, which reports $4 billion in assets under management. The fact that these institutional investors decided to trust So-Young International Inc. is appealing. The image below provides further details on this matter:Source: ProspectusThere are two features that investors may not appreciate. The company expects to have two types of shares after the IPO goes live, class A and class B shares. Each Class A ordinary share provides one vote, and each Class B ordinary share provides thirty votes and is convertible into one Class A ordinary share at any time by the holders thereof. IPO investors can acquire Class A shares, but not Class B shares. This is not ideal. It means that existing shareholders are trying to protect their ownership. If the management does not perform, hiring a new one could be difficult on this name.In addition, the company expects to be controlled after the IPO, which is another detrimental feature. Read the lines below for further details on this matter:As a result of the equity structure, the Board of Directors is expected to be controlled, which means that directors may make decisions to benefit the largest shareholder. Such decisions may go against the interests of minority shareholders. As shown in the lines below, So-Young International may elect a non-independent Board of Directors:In addition, for investors located in the United States, it is detrimental that the company was incorporated in the Cayman Islands. It means that the company's corporate affairs are being governed by Companies Law of the Cayman Islands, which offers less protection to shareholders than that in the U.S.So-Young International does not mention the name of any competitor in the prospectus. The lines below provide further details on this matter.Source: ProspectusSince no Chinese medical aesthetic service platforms are trading in the United States, let’s use Chinese e-commerce platforms and search engines.As shown in the image below, other Chinese companies trading in the United States have an EV/Forward sales ratio of 0.5x-6.5x. However, these other online competitors report revenue growth of 23% to 30% y/y and a gross profit margin of less than 50%. So-Young International reports both larger revenue growth and gross profit margin. It means that So-Young International should trade at more than 6.5x forward sales. The images below provide further details on the valuation of peers. Note that these companies are very large compared to So-Young International. With that said, using these peers is better than not using peers at all.Source: YchartsAs of December 31, 2018, So-Young International reported revenue growth of 138% y/y, which should impress IPO investors. With this figure in mind, assuming forward sales of $178 million seems reasonable. Using a ratio of 6.5x forward sales, the total enterprise value should be equal to more than $1.157 billion.Reporting revenue growth of 138% y/y and with Apax as a shareholder, So-Young International should attract growth investors. With other e-commerce platforms trading at more than 0.5x-6.5x forward sales, So-Young International should trade at a minimum of 6.5x forward sales. Keep in mind that both the revenue growth and the gross profit margin of the company are larger than that of peers. Having mentioned these great features, investors should also be aware that the company was incorporated in the Cayman Islands, where securities laws are not that developed. In addition, the company is expected to be controlled after the IPO goes live. Investors should understand these detrimental features well before touching the shares of So-Young International."
4265508,104644,2019-05-21T10:13:05-04:00,"The medical aesthetic industry in China is booming.SY is well positioned with a unique business model, technological innovations and wide user base.The key risk factor for SY is uncertainties brought by the global trade war.In the long run, SY has strong potential for growth.","So-Young International (SY) is a China-based online marketplace for plastic surgery services. It made its debut in Nasdaq on May 02, 2019 and share prices surged 22% for the following two weeks due to investors' optimism towards the booming medical aesthetic industry in China. However, SY's share price then declined due to the escalating China-US trade war. So what is the future outlook for SY in the market of greater volatility?Data by YChartsSY has a unique business model. First of all, it runs accounts on multiple social media platforms, including WeChat, Zhihu, and Weibo (WB). These accounts serve as a hub of information for reviewing medical aesthetic services and providing consulting services for potential customers. Second, it has an app which provides online reservation services by connecting 35 million users with more than 30,000 licensed doctors for plastic surgery treatment.Its revenues are comprised of two parts - information services, meaning ad sales and commission fees, and reservation services. Reservation services used to be the main source of revenue. Gradually, the revenue share of information services increased, and as of FY 2018, it takes up 67.3% of total revenue.The change in SY's revenue structure is related to trends in the medical aesthetic industry. According to research institute Frost & Sullivan, customer acquisition spendings in online channels by medical aesthetic service providers have been growing at a rapid speed. With its highly engaged user base, SY is well positioned to benefit from this boom of spending.Besides the rising importance of online marketing, the overall market of physical beauty in China has also been expanding rapidly. According to Frost & Sullivan, the compound annual growth rate for China’s medical aesthetics market was 23.6% from 2014 to 2018. China is expected to surpass the US to become the world’s largest cosmetic medical services market by 2021. ""The Chinese cosmetic surgery market will remain promising over the next five years,"" says Jin Xing, the founder of SY.At the same time, SY keeps expanding its services with many innovative measures. For example, it has been working on improving its online consulting services with intelligent algorithms while developing video-streaming functions on its platform. Through these endeavors, SY proves itself to be a more effective customer acquisition channel for medical aesthetic service providers, compared to many other online channels.SY has been showing strong growth momentum since it was founded in 2013. In 2018, its revenue surged 138% year on year to more than $90 million. Its net profit was $8.012 million in 2018, a YoY growth of 220%.Source: author, data from So-Young Form F-1SY issued 13 million American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") and the EPS is $0.616. Its P/E ratio is 26.02, and dividing this number with 220%, the 2018 growth rate of net earnings, we get the PEG ratio for SY of 0.12.Comparing SY with most other listed companies in the plastic surgery industry, we can find SY is greatly undervalued. One comparable is Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp. (IART). The plastic and reconstructive surgery segment contributed 43.3% to its total revenues in the last reported quarter. Analysts forecast that IART has a long-term earnings growth rate for three-to-five years of 10.8%. Currently, the company's P/E ratio is 54.47. Thus, the PEG ratio for IART is 5.04, which is almost 50 times higher than for SY.SY is well positioned for growth in the booming medical aesthetic industry in China. Its unique business model, technological innovations and wide user base give it competitive advantages that late-movers in this industry do not own.That said, risks always come with opportunities. The biggest risk for SY at this moment is uncertainties brought by the China-US trade war. On one hand, negative investor sentiments towards China-concept stocks put strong pressure on SY's stock price. On the other hand, the US tariffs will very likely trigger a recession in China's economy, which will cause declines in residents' disposable income and companies' revenues. If consumers spend less on plastic surgeries and hospitals spend less on online marketing, SY's profits will certainly get hurt.However, it is important to remember that the Chinese market is simply so huge. Even with the trade war, the giant domestic market still presents SY plenty of space for continued growth. We believe SY has huge potential to deliver strong and stable growth in its profits for the next several years."
4291911,104644,2019-09-16T18:01:29-04:00,"SY's lower operating margin in Q2 is normal considering its growth stage and the seasonality factor.SY serves the growing domestic demand for plastic surgeries, which will not be severely impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.The current price presents an opportunity to buy as SY's fundamentals are healthy and sustainable in the expanding market.","On Aug. 29, 2019, So-Young International (SY) announced its second-quarter 2019 financial results. Before the announcement, investors had high hopes and the share price of SY climbed to $16.6, the highest level for the past month. However, SY finally reported an actual EPS of $0.03, missing expectations by 40%. This caused a huge sell-off in the market, with the share price plummeting by 37% to $11.04 in one day.Although the Q2 results are not ideal, the message it delivers is also not so horrible as many investors fathom. The selloff after the earnings release is an overreaction, and the market will eventually correct itself.Data by YChartsDespite the disappointing EPS, the latest earning release actually contained quite some good news. SY's total revenues were RMB 285.0 million, an 87.3% increase from the same period of 2018 and exceeding the company's guidance of RMB 280 million. The better-than-expected revenue result shows SY still has high growth momentum.The major factor causing SY's EPS decline is its low operating margin, which is 4%, significantly lower than 18% in 2019 Q1. It is actually very normal for a company in the early stage to see fluctuations in its operating costs. As SY keeps expanding its business and acquiring more users, it needs to spend more on cost items like operational staff headcount, event organization, and marketing.Seasonality factors also contribute to the lower operating margin in Q2 2019. According to the company management, SY typically reduces its user acquisition activities in the first quarter of every year since its business tends to be the slowest at that time due to the Chinese New Year (when everyone stays home with family members and no one wants to get a nose job). SY's operating expenses tend to peak during the second and the third quarter as it builds up marketing efforts in preparation for the various shopping festivals in Q4.The selloff also comes at a time when the China-US trade war keeps escalating and investors are deeply worried about China' economic outlook and the fate of China-concept stocks.The latest data as seen in the graph below does not show a significant slowdown in China's exports, although China's August exports to the US fell 16% year-on-year. China has been taking multiple measures to mitigate the impact of tariffs and attract foreign investment. In the current situation, the trade war will not weigh on Chinese consumers' purchasing power too much.The macroeconomic impact on the medical aesthetics industry is mixed. On one hand, China's retaliatory tariff makes imports of certain products and equipment from the US more expensive, which cuts medical service providers' profit margins and reduces their budget for online marketing. On the other hand, the medical aesthetics industry in China is mostly driven by domestic demand. As RMB gets weaker, fewer customers may choose to go abroad like Korea and Japan for plastic surgeries. Chinese service providers, as affordable alternatives, become more competitive. According to Frost & Sullivan in 2018, the total revenue of this industry in China is expected to reach RMB360.1 billion by 2023, with an accelerated CAGR of 24.2% from 2018 to 2023. The growing domestic demand will be strong support both for SY and service providers during this time of great volatility.The selloff of SY is a market overreaction, fueled by investors' worries about the macroeconomic outlook of China and SY seemingly lacking growth momentum. The current price of $11.17 presents an opportunity to buy, as the company's fundamentals are healthy and SY is well-positioned to continuously benefit from the expanding mainland Chinese market. Despite that, in the long run, SY needs to further invest in diversifying its revenue source and upgrading services, as once the market becomes saturated, SY has to come up with new ways to increase service providers and consumers' willingness to pay on its platform."
4274867,104361,2019-07-14T22:02:25-04:00,So-Young International is the leading online platform for China’s medical aesthetic services industry.The market is growing fast thanks to the consumption upgrade trend in China and the rising middle class in major cities.The current price of So-Young presents a good entry point for investors who are interested in this market.,"So-Young International (NASDAQ: SY), listed in April 2019, is a unique opportunity for investors to get a foot in China’s fast-growing medical aesthetic services industry. This market is considered to be just exploding as part of China’s consumption upgrade path, along with the economic growth. We expect SY to ride on the market growth and deliver nice revenue results.So-Young International is considered to be the No.1 online destination for discovering, evaluating and reserving medical aesthetic services in China. In another word, SY doesn’t provide medical services directly, but serves as a platform connecting customers and service providers (think about Yelp (YELP) as a comparison, but for medical services only).(Source: So-Young website)Investors in the States might not be quite familiar with this market, as this has never been a major thing for Western countries. There is no direct comparable company in the States to benchmark on SY. In Asia though, medical aesthetic services have grown extremely popular, thanks to the broadcasting effects from movie stars / fashion models.The market in China is considered to be just taking off. With the economic growth and emerging middle class in major cities, people’s demand for improving quality of life and psychological well-being has been growing accordingly, or even faster. According to the third-party research presented in SY’s prospectus, the market sits at a total revenue of close to $18 billion and will grow into over $50 billion by 2023, representing 25% CAGR.With the penetration of internet and mobile, customer acquisition spending on online medical aesthetic platforms went up from 0.9% in 2014 to 7.0% in 2018, and is expected to reach 25.6% by 2023. This presents a 58% CAGR opportunity for the online customer acquisition business.(Source: SY’s Prospectus)SY’s business model comprises three integrated components:(Source: SY’s Prospectus)Based on this business model, SY’s revenues were generated from two major sources, including:From 2016 to 2018, SY’s total revenue grew 12X from less than RMB 50MM to over RMB 600MM. The revenue distribution between information services and reservation services is about 2:1. The fact that the company still has 1/3th of its revenue coming from the customer side shows the strong demand in the market (imagine if Google charges people for searching - what will happen?)(Source: SY’s Prospectus)Although the sales and marketing expenses grew at the same speed as the revenues, we think that’s acceptable, as SY is building up its customer base and network. Once the company can reach a dominating position in the market (which it actually already has) and become the “go-to” place for everyone, we would see its financials go up quickly.China’s GDP per capita reached 3000 USD in 2011. That’s the point when people stop worrying about basic need for food and clothes, and turn to consideration of life quality and physical well-being, or what we called consumption upgrade.Among all the sectors that benefit from China’s huge consumption upgrade path, medical aesthetic service is definitely a niche but fast-growing sector that has huge potential. A most comparable example would be China’s neighbor in Asia, South Korea, which has a huge medical aesthetic services industry. In fact, this service in South Korea is so successful that it has become a globally renowned industry. There were said to be around 15-20 million people visiting South Korea for medical tourism. Although we don’t know how many of the visitors were from China, this does show the huge demand for the service.SY is now trading at about 10% down from its IPO price and at around 4x-5x Price/Sales. We feel the current valuation is relatively cheap for such a high-growth company, presenting a good entry point for investors.(Source: Seeking Alpha)As a Chinese company that relies on the country’s overall consumption growth, SY’s business is certainly exposed to the risk of the country’s economic slowdown. Also, as a medical/healthcare information provider, SY has the legal obligation if the information on its platform is proven to be fake or misleading.Overall, we feel SY provides a unique opportunity for investors to share the fast growth of China’s consumption upgrade or, more specifically, the growing demand for medical aesthetic services. We expect the company to continue to grow at 20+% in revenues in the coming quarters, and the current price presents a good entry opportunity."

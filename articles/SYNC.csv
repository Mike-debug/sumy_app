4092465,76555,2017-08-01T05:00:00-04:00,"Synacor is a growing, profitable business with a good management team, yet its stock is suffering from challenged optics.Top line has only grown at a 4.4% 3-year CAGR, but one of its segments has declined from 50% of revenue to 10%, masking growth in others.It was awarded a game changing contract but made a large investment in opex and capex ahead of the first dollar of revenue, masking considerable margin improvement.It’s transitioning one of its businesses to a ratable model further pressuring GAAP top-line growth while deferred revenue takes off.Optics aside, we believe positive changes will become clear in 2H17. Management’s mid-term guidance implies a current valuation of 4.2x EBITDA while recent contract milestones and comScore data significantly de-risk the investment thesis.","Synacor (NASDAQ:SYNC) or “the Company” is undervalued due to challenged optics. Facing headwinds in one of its business lines, SYNC has had to replace 37% of its revenue over the last four years. Thus, the Company’s growth rate appears to be a meager 4% CAGR, masking healthy growth in other businesses. In addition, Synacor won a game-changing contract with AT&T (NYSE:T) in May of 2016, yet has had to spend $10 million ahead of the first dollar of revenue. This incremental spend has masked the 500 bps of EBITDA margin improvement that management has otherwise achieved. In addition, SYNC’s software business line is transitioning from a perpetual to a ratable license model causing revenue in this segment to appear flat despite growing deferred revenue.Optics aside, Synacor has undergone significant positive change over the last several years and we believe these changes will become clear in 2H17. Our analysis of management’s guidance for FY17 suggests SYNC will be on a $20M EBITDA runrate exiting this year implying just 6.3x EBITDA.Moreover, management’s mid-term guidance calls for $30M of EBITDA which implies a valuation of 4.2x EBITDA at current prices and could prove conservative.SYNC went public in February 2012 in a low-quality IPO at $5 having unsuccessfully attempted to price between $10-12. It was promoted aggressively by the National Inflation Association (“NIA”), what was in our opinion an active pump-and-dump shop from several years ago. It was pumped, and subsequently dumped with shares reaching a height of $16 before the IPO unlock sent the stock into the mid-single digits. Shares remained in this range until news of its loss of Charter Communications as a customer in 2014 drove the stock down below $2.In 2014, JEC and Ratio Capital formed a group and initiated a proxy fight to get three board seats and attempt to oust management. This action caused SYNC’s board to get its act together and oversee cost cuts and the installation of a new CEO, Himesh Bhise. Shareholders ultimately backed the board and the activist group lost the fight.Bhise, for all intents and purposes, was/is perfect for the job (if not overqualified). He is a McKinsey alum with a career in senior roles at Charter, AOL, and Comcast – direct competitors or target customers of SYNC. He has also attracted additional talent to SYNC since joining.SYNC’s core business is (and has been) developing and managing web portals for cable/telco/wireless/OEM customers. A good example would be CenturyLink’s (CTL) web portal. If a CenturyLink subscriber goes to its website to login to his or her CenturyLink account/email/streaming, the portal that subscriber lands on is developed and operated by Synacor. Synacor has a revenue share with CenturyLink for advertising (clicks/impressions) and a tri-party revenue share with Google and CenturyLink for search.SYNC’s new CEO inherited the portal business and has made strategic and low-cost tuck-in acquisitions to strengthen Synacor’s offering. Synacor has expanded its ad network significantly outside of portals with its $3 million acquisition of Technorati in February 2016 and is now a top 20 digital ad property as measured by comScore. The Company’s video technology and content delivery enables a multiscreen experience, and HBO Go and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are now using its Cloud ID to authenticate viewers. Through its $25 million acquisition of Zimbra in November 2015, SYNC now manages over 500 million email boxes for its various customers with value-added services such as virus protection and cloud storage. SYNC also entered the mobile space with native mobile portal sites and portal apps.This progress is against an overarching backdrop of a significant new contract win from AT&T for its portal business that has yet to hit revenue. SYNC won this contract from Yahoo largely as a result of SYNC’s portal modernization (discussed below) and it is expected to add $100M of revenue which is quite significant given that overall revenue is currently $127M.Based on the AT&T contract and success in other areas of the business, SYNC’s new management team has guided to $300M of revenue and $30M of EBITDA by 2019. The Company has a $115M enterprise value. If management ultimately achieves its targets, the Company is trading for 4.2x EBITDA and roughly 0.4x revenue. Moreover, the Company is currently generating FCF despite having spent $10M (OpEx & CapEx) on the AT&T contract ahead of booked revenue. Given the spend to ramp AT&T and the decline in search, this Company’s TTM optics are currently ugly. This situation should change during the second half of 2017.Our more conservative model calls for $247M of revenue in 2019 and $22M of EBITDA. A 10x EBITDA multiple – below its comp-group median and conservative for a business growing organically at a 24% CAGR – results in a price target 77% above today’s price with potential for highly asymmetric upside from a variety of additional value drivers. Moreover, we view the story as being incrementally de-risked as the new AT&T portal is in phased rollout having already been introduced in thirty states.Synacor’s legacy core business builds and manages outsourced Internet portals for ISP and OEM customers. Notable customers include CenturyLink (~20% of revenue), Windstream, Lenovo, and Toshiba. These customers command a fairly consistent amount of Internet traffic by virtue of their respective relationships with consumers. Synacor partners with these firms to monetize this traffic by building and managing customer portals, populating those portals with engaging content, and sharing the resulting advertising and search dollars with its customers.Synacor’s business is driven by Unique Visitors (UVs), which in turn are driven by ISP subscribers. Synacor and its ISP customers work together to drive engagement with the portals. The following CenturyLink portal screenshot illustrates the value-chain underlying Synacor’s Portal business:In general, ISPs face a slowly declining user base due to cord-cutting and competition between cable and telco providers. This is reflected in SYNC’s portal traffic, which has declined at a 2.1% 3-year CAGR. This relative stability comes despite the Company’s historic lack of a mobile presence and exemplifies the inherent strength of ISP subscriber traffic.Synacor’s business can be broken down into three buckets:Digital Advertising (47% of TTM revenue)Digital advertising includes video, image and text ads delivered on one of Synacor’s managed portals. Advertising inventory is filled with advertisements sourced by the Company’s direct sales force, independent reps and ad network partners. Revenue is generated when an advertisement displays (an “impression”), or when consumers view/click an advertisement (an “action”). Digital advertising revenue is calculated on a cost per impression or cost per action basis. Revenue is recognized based on amounts received from advertising customers according to contractually-determined rates. SYNC’s managed portal and advertising customers typically have an initial term of two to three years and frequently provide for one or more automatic renewal terms of one or two years each.In addition to the inventory available on SYNC portals, the Company added a programmatic platform for advertisers through its February 2016 acquisition of Technorati. According to comScore and Company reports, Synacor now reaches more than 80% of total Internet users and is a top-twenty digital ad property. We remain cognizant of the fact that nearly all advertising platforms operate in the shadow of Google and Facebook. However, we think that Synacor is a consideration for advertisers given (1) its reach of 200 million monthly unique visitors rivals leading Internet platforms, (2) its strong video, monetization, and operations platforms; and 3) it offers diversification.Synacor’s digital advertising revenue has grown at a 3-year 21% CAGR as the Company expanded into faster-growing advertising segments, particularly video. Video commands higher CPMs, or Cost Per Mille (=cost per thousand). In addition, SYNC’s sales team has successfully negotiated incrementally more attractive rates, and FY16 saw the introduction of syndicated advertising. Prior to the Technorati acquisition, revenue per UV had been growing in the high-teens. Syndicated revenue has brought down headline revenue/unique visitor, but we note that this metric has climbed sequentially for each of the past three quarters.Synacor’s reporting format includes Digital Advertising with Search Advertising revenue (outlined below). The overall bucket generates gross margins in the high-30s/low-40s.Recurring and Fee-Based (42% of TTM revenue)Recurring and Fee-Based revenue includes subscription fees and other fees received from customers for the use of SYNC’s proprietary technology including:Email/Collaboration: Synacor has been providing white-label email hosting, security and migration utilizing the Zimbra platform for over a decade. In September 2015, Synacor acquired Zimbra. Following the transaction, SYNC’s software and managed service offering supports ~530 million email accounts. Zimbra employs a “Red Hat” model whereby its software is open sourced but value added components and services are offered for a fee.Only ~20% of Zimbra-based email accounts are paying subscribers and thus there is significant runway to capture wallet share through value-added services. Synacor’s email revenue commands software-type gross margins in the 80% range.Video/CloudID and Search & Discovery: Cloud ID performs frictionless auto-authentication allowing subscribers to view content on myriad devices. HBO GO and Apple Single Sign-On employ Synacor’s CloudID platform to authenticate its users. Synacor’s authentication services also support Sling TV and PlayStation Vue. This revenue segment is in its infancy but enjoys 90%+ gross margin.Search & Discovery Metadata Platform: Once a consumer is authenticated, SYNC’s Search & Discovery platform helps them easily find desired content. Videos are curated daily and SYNC has compiled more than 2.2 million long- and short-form videos from hundreds of sources.Monthly subscriber levels typically form the basis for calculating and generating revenue in this line item. Subscriber levels are generally determined by multiplying a per-sub per-month fee by the number of subs using a particular service. In other cases, the fee is fixed. Revenue is also recognized from the licensing and distribution of SYNC’s email/collaboration products and services, including perpetual licenses.We expect that this segment will contribute considerably to management’s growth targets yet the chart above clearly depicts revenue flat-lining from 4Q15. The sequential step-change in quarterly revenue after 3Q15 was due to the acquisition of Zimbra. Zimbra’s core email platform can be sold either as a perpetual license or a subscription service. Although top-line appears to be flat, we have been able to track growth in this segment through deferred revenue, a balance-sheet line item that grows as subscription services are sold but yet to be recognized as revenue.Search Advertising (11% of TTM revenue)Synacor has a revenue-sharing relationship with Google, pursuant to which SYNC includes a Google-branded search tool on its managed portals. When a consumer makes a search query using this tool, Synacor delivers the search to Google who returns search results to the consumer that includes advertiser-sponsored links. If a consumer clicks a sponsored link, Google receives payment from the advertiser and shares a portion of that payment with Synacor, who in turn shares a portion with the portal customer.Search has declined on an absolute basis, and as a percentage of revenue over the past several years. The decline is largely attributable to three factors: 1) lower search activity associated with increased usage of mobile search; 2) when Microsoft introduced its new “Edge” Internet browser, it moved pre-loaded portal URLs (e.g., Toshiba or Lenovo) to the second tab as a default; and 3) degraded economics on search from Google.These factors have caused Synacor’s Search Advertising business to contract considerably. Search revenue per unique visitor has declined to $0.08 in 2016 from $2.76 in 2013. The good news, however, is that Search is a relatively insignificant portion of overall revenue and so this headwind will abate.Synacor’s revenue profile has changed considerably over the last several years. New management has met a 72% decline in Search revenue with 79% growth in Digital Advertising and 145% growth in Recurring & Fee-Based revenue.Growth in Digital Advertising revenue was largely organic with incremental help from the 2016 Technorati acquisition’s (cost just $3 million) ~$7 million of revenue to the Company’s $26 million overall increase. Growth in Recurring & Fee Based revenue was primarily the result of Synacor’s 2015 acquisition of Zimbra for ~$25 million which contributed an estimated $28 million of revenue. Thus, despite areas of Synacor’s business growing both organically and via acquisition, overall revenue growth appears muted due to the decline of search. As we mentioned previously, search now accounts for less than 10% of revenue.Source: Synacor Historical FinancialsPrior to the AT&T contract win, Synacor’s new management team had taken steps to moderate expenses and focus on higher-margin revenue components. Excluding the $6.0 million OpEx portion of 2016 AT&T spend, new management has added more than 500 bps to EBITDA margin.Synacor introduced its next generation portal in 2015 just as Yahoo, a third-party portal provider for various properties, was dropping the ball. SYNC’s next generation portal unifies the “start” experience across devices, provides email previews, seamlessly integrates video, has a recommendation engine, and is personalized for the user (promotions, personalized ads, feeds) after the consumer’s first play. Synacor’s next-gen portal was instrumental in winning a contract to develop and manage AT&T’s portal. AT&T is the largest wireless carrier in the US1, the largest pay TV provider, and a top ten broadband provider.Synacor’s AT&T contract win from Yahoo was announced in May of 2016. Given that Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is acquiring Yahoo, this doesn’t surprise us; AT&T likely doesn’t want Verizon managing its portal. Moreover, management insists that AT&T put out a bid before the Verizon/Yahoo combination was announced. In any event, management expects that AT&T will generate an incremental $100 million of revenue for SYNC from both search and digital advertising once fully rolled out and penetrated. Synacor’s existing Search & Digital Advertising business is currently $75M, so the addition of AT&T more than doubles this segment. AT&T’s revenue predictably comes with lower margins which we estimate will ultimately be in the mid-20% range.Synacor’s incremental investment to develop and implement AT&T’s portal is $10 million split 80/20 between operating expense and capital expenditure. As of the end of 1Q17, SYNC has fully absorbed the $10 million of the required incremental expense and progress along the rollout timeline remains on track. With the AT&T portal site recently launched, the investment thesis is incrementally de-risked.Source: start.att.net [Notice it says ""Powered by Synacor"" in the lower left]Moreover, the comScore media trend statistics for AT&T’s new portal look promising. Unique visitors, average length of visit, and views per visitor have spiked considerably as Synacor continues its geographic rollout. Our base case portrays a 2019 scenario whereby AT&T revenue lands in shouting distance of management’s target, the core Search & Digital Advertising revenue enjoys slight growth from new deals signed, and Recurring & Fee Based Revenue grows as the Video/CloudID gains traction and more email mailboxes convert to paid accounts. Below are the assumptions used in the base case scenario:1. According to its most recent quarterly release, AT&T has 134.9M wireless connections vs. Verizon's 114.5M.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

4337763,21815,2020-04-15T13:26:11-04:00,"Synacor is merging with Qumu in an all-stock deal, giving the combination more of a recurring SaaS nature.While the two businesses have been stagnant individually, there are some tentative reasons to think the combination will do better, like a big new customer for Synacor's ID business.If they do, given the high gross margin and very low valuation, this could quickly become very interesting for investors.","Synacor (SYNC) has been lingering on the loss of a significant customer (ATT.net), even if that wasn't caused by dissatisfaction with their services. However, a new big (yet unnamed) customer and the merger with Qumu (QUMU) could breathe new life into the company.Even a little growth will improve the bottom line pretty significantly as the company's recurring and high-margin SaaS part will be larger after the merger, and there are some reasons to be hopeful here.Given the very low valuation that would also quickly add to share gains, as the shares have been lingering:Synacor has two segments:The Software and Services business consists of an email and collaboration platform (Zimbra) and an identity management platform (Cloud ID).Two recent events stand out which is changing the company quite a bit:The loss of the consumer-facing ATT portal has already been discussed by SA contributor Eight Diamond Advisors. It didn't come as a surprise as AT&T now partners with Verizon (VZ) which already powers AT&T's email service (via Yahoo).Nevertheless, while not caused by any major dissatisfaction with their service, needless to say that the loss of a client of this size is a considerable setback.On the other hand, the company announced a big new customer for its ID management business, so the business still has significant opportunities.Qumu is recognized as a leader in enterprise video and a contender in video conferencing. While the latter garners most of the attention in these times where business travel has come to a halt and many people work from home, it's the former that also deserves attention (Q4CC):There is an extensive description of the Qumu Enterprise Video Platform in their 10-K which will flesh out this intelligent video handling in considerable detail, so we refer to that. Revenues haven't really been growing for Qumu, from the 10-K:However, one has to add that the 2019 result was negatively impacted by the delay in three major customer expansion deals (two of which have now closed).And although the company generates impressive gross margins (10-K):It's pretty far from profitable (10-K):That's a $5.3M operational loss last year. However, given the impressive gross margins, this can quickly turn around if the company scales and cut some of the operational cost at the same time, which is exactly what the merger aims to achieve.On the cost side, there are some $4-5M of synergies already identified, underpinning expectations of the deal being accretive to both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in the first fiscal year after close (excluding purchase accounting).On the revenue side, combining the two companies enables a more compelling platform (Q4CC):This is likely to lead to significant cross-selling opportunities given the diverse client base of the two solutions.The combined company is expected to have over $120M in annual revenue on a pro forma basis. This will include an estimated $70M in software revenue, about 70% of which is recurring and approximately $50M in revenues from Synacor's portal and advertising business (ex ATT).The transaction is structured as an all-stock deal with each share of Qumu will be converted into approximately 1.61 shares of Synacor shares. The merger is expected to close mid-2020.Revenue in Q4 was $26.8M which was conform expectations. EPS came in 2 cents better at $0.00, with GAAP net loss of $0.6M and adjusted EBITDA of $3.4M both exceeding the high end of the guidance range.Here is an overview of the last several years from the 10-K:Basically, the company hasn't been profitable; although, on an adjusted EBITDA basis, things look much better. What causes the difference between the $9M GAAP loss and the $9.5M adjusted EBITDA profit for 2019? Well:Portal & Advertising segment totaled $15.2M compared to $27M in the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding the $12.1M of ATT.net revenue in Q4 '18, revenue was actually up 2%.As we will show below, even a little growth of the combined combination would quickly improve the bottom line, given the recurring nature of almost half of revenue and the high gross margins. Are there reasons for optimism here? Well:On the big new cloud ID customer, from the Q4CC:This isn't all that much to go on, and the ad business is likely to be negatively impacted by the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. On the other hand, Qumu's videoconferencing business could get a boost from that.From the earnings PR:This includes transaction costs but no revenues from the Qumu acquisition.Data by YChartsThe Software segment produced a gross margin of about 74% and an EBITDA margin of about 31%. The Advertising segment delivered a 36% gross margin and about a 17% EBITDA margin.Margins did improve notably the last two quarters with gross margin getting a boost because of the exit of ATT.net, which shifted the revenue mix in favor of the higher margin Software segment.Non-GAAP operating cost declined 25.3% to $12M in Q4, although part of that is, of course, related to the exit of ATT.net.Data by YChartsGiven the losses at Qumu, one might also want to consider these:Data by YChartsThat turns out not too bad actually. Combined, the company isn't losing all that much cash, and with the $4-5M of cost synergies that might very well turn positive, after the integration is completed.Until then, the company has $11M of cash (and no debt) from Synacor and $10.6M in cash (and no debt) from Qumu, they should be quite comfortable here.Data by YChartsValuations are really pretty low. There are, of course, reasons for that, neither company is really growing much, nor are they profitable, although it should be noted that a little more than half of Qumu's market cap is cash.As each share of Qumu will be converted into approximately 1.61 shares of Synacor shares, as there are 13M shares outstanding that convert into 21M shares of Synacor. Adding the 39M existing shares gives 60M shares for the combined company, giving the combined combination an EV/S of 0.3.There seem to be others who think the shares are cheap, from FinViz:Not something investors see every day, but this time, we see it twice as the picture is similar for Qumu (FinViz):There already were some green shoots for the companies individually, as the big new customer for Synacor's ID business. However, we think the combined company makes more sense.There is some reason to argue that the combination is a better proposition for potential customers and that there are some cross-selling opportunities to gain.Also, $4-5M in cost-cutting goes a long way to move the combined company to generate cash and break-even.The combined company will produce in the order of $120M in revenues, nearly $50M of which are high-margin recurring SaaS sales. If they manage to scale that even a little, the effect on results will be quite noticeable.As valuation is modest, this scenario will also have quite an impact on that. The only problem with it is that we're not sure it's going to materialize, although there are a few promising signs."
2074513,55522,2014-03-07T10:56:56-05:00,"Synacor trades at an unattractive 11x EV/EBITDA driven by a disappointing 2014 business outlook of $2-5 million EBITDA versus analysts' consensus of $8 million.Deterioration in key business metrics: unique visitors, search queries and advertising impressions.Growth potential in mobile and international expansion, notably China.","Editor’s Note: This article covers a stock trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less than a $100 million market cap. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.Inspired by the possibility of Verizon expanding its online TV services, I researched further into Synacor (NASDAQ:SYNC), whose software is utilized to support FiOS' existing TV Everywhere services. Below I share both the pros and cons of investing in SYNC.Company DescriptionSYNC provides web portals for cable and telecom operators. SYNC generates approximately 50% revenues from search, 30% from advertising, and the remaining 20% from subscriptions. SYNC provides the authentication services for its cable partners by verifying the subscriber ID with the cable operator's subscriber database.Stock RepurchaseWith $36.4 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal 2013, SYNC announced that it would repurchase up to $5 million of its outstanding common stock, which represents around 6.5% of total outstanding shares. This shareholder-friendly policy will help to alleviate some downward pressure resulting from the weak guidance in 2014.2014 Business OutlookThe following is from the 4Q 2013 earning release:2014 revenues are well below the Capital IQ consensus of $117.17 million, and 2014 adjusted EBITDA is below analysts' consensus of $7 million. This sub-par guidance drove SYNC to decline more than 10% after hours in Wednesday trading.Deterioration in Key Business MetricsAnother excerpt from the 4Q 2013 earning release:For fiscal 2013, Synacor averaged 19.8 million unique visitors per month, compared to 20.4 million in fiscal 2012. Search queries were 712 million for fiscal 2013, compared to 968 million in fiscal 2012. Advertising impressions were 41.0 billion, compared to 42.2 billion in fiscal 2012.Combining these declining business metrics with below expectation 2014 revenues forecast, no doubt some investors have decided to hit the sell button before asking any questions.Nevertheless, there are some pros left for SYNC investors below:Investors May Underestimate the Impact of R&D investmentSource: MSN MoneyIn the past five years, SYNC has already invested around $100 million in R&D. However, SYNC is valued at around $40 million on an Enterprise Value basis. In other words, prospective investors pay 40 cents on a dollar to buy all the R&D efforts paid by SYNC.In addition, the significant R&D investment helps to create a great competitive advantage for SYNC to remain a leader in TV Everywhere services. This is a high-growth industry as more and more people would like to access their online TV programs anytime and anywhere.Growth Opportunity in MobileSYNC targeted the mobile platform for its future growth. That is why it acquired Teknision, an Android development platform company, to extend its presence in mobile and provide a platform for developing custom Android launchers and intelligent home-screens for mobile and consumer electronics companies. I believe that this is the right strategic move to expand into mobile.Time to Leverage the R&D InvestmentThe management team has already announced its intention to expand overseas, particularly in China. The following is an excerpt from the presentation at Noble Financial Capital Markets' Tenth Annual Equity Conference:More advertising, especially video, is a great opportunity for us and frankly international is really a greenfield for us. We've got a fairly small amount of revenue coming from outside the U.S. today. We announced a joint venture earlier in 2013 in China. And as our partners over there said the first time I met with them everything that works in the U.S. works in China except it's 10 times bigger, but it takes a lot longer.Have already invested $100 million in R&D, it is time for SYNC to leverage its technological lead in TV Everywhere in order to generate more advertising revenues in the international market. As the R&D budget will be spread against a bigger revenue base in the future, the profit margin should expand.ValuationTaking the mid-point of 2014 adjusted EBITDA announced today, SYNC is valued at about 11x EV/EBITDA. On a P/E ratio, SYNC is valued at 28x. Currently, both EV/EBITDA and P/E do not indicate much value for prospective investors.Bottom LineAlthough I found that Renaissance Technologies held 227,300 shares as of December 31, 2013, while previous analyst consensus EBITDA of $8 million made the investment reasonable, yesterday's released 2014 guidance of $2-5 million EBITDA drove investors to dial down their bullish assumptions. Based on the revised unattractive valuation of SYNC, investors should be wise to stay on the sideline.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2826056,73555,2015-01-17T08:44:26-05:00,"Since August, SYNC has been operating under strong new management.SYNC's ""acqui-hire"" of industry wave-maker NimbleTV raises our expectations for Synacor's ""TV Everywhere"" bid.If there is an inflection point for SYNC, this may be it.","N.B. With a market capitalization of ~$64M, SYNC is classified as a micro-cap stock. Investors should always perform due diligence in their investment decisions, but we emphasize this further in the case of this company.Synacor (NASDAQ:SYNC) - a vague, many-tentacled ""cloud-based services"" company - is one of those companies that simply wasn't ready for the IPO. An uncontrolled pump-and-dump became an unmitigated disaster for early shareholders and confidence simply hasn't recovered since. Hovering around book-value for a few recent months, the stock hasn't been eliciting any praise or votes of confidence, either.SYNC data by YChartsSo while we could debate the wisdom of going public in the first place, we would rather take a look at the hand as it's been dealt and consider the future of the company, especially after a restructuring in August and a very interesting acquisition on Thursday expanded the company's possibilities greatly, solidifying a new, investor-friendly attitude toward doing business.AugustOn August 25th, Ron Frankel stepped down as Synacor's CEO. Frankel had held the position since 2001, taken the company through the IPO, and sold a lot of shares along the way.His successor: Himesh Bhise (""be-say""), a growth-focused consumer-TV and video executive straight from Comcast. With a background in seemingly everything that Synacor has tried to be, and with strong experience in the higher-growth, higher-potential segments (especially in mobile, where Synacor has failed to execute), Bhise was, according to Chairman and founder Jordan Levy, ""the right leader for Synacor at this time of enormous opportunity.""As a good sign to corroborate the positive change, the first investor presentation since Bhise's appointment was absolutely brutal. Keywords: ""Restructuring,"" ""monetization,"" ""operating discipline,"" ""streamline"" (lay off 20% of the workforce), and ""growth.""The former ""operating leadership,"" the presentation suggests, was the real problem with the company. Bhise does not seem at all interested in pulling punches. This kind of talk is clearly aimed at potential investors, which should come as a welcome shift in priority.JanuaryOne of the most critical decisions for any company, and a truly life-or-death decision for software-based companies, is whether to ""build or buy."" Preventing time spent in endless development that ends up more expensive than simply buying a finished product (or better people) is one of the most important (and unpopular) decisions that management at a company like Synacor can make. Page 17 in the aforementioned presentation suggests that this is now a primary concern for the company, which is a good start.And then, Thursday's high-profile ""acqui-hire"" successfully put those words into action. From the press release:In 2Q14, this acquisition would have been unthinkable. A lot has changed in a few months.Establishing a vertical, building a productTV Everywhere video (TVE) is a critical defensive move for traditional television providers, and getting it right is worth a lot. With Cloud ID, Synacor has already been barking up the right tree in this business segment.By tying authorization credentials to individuals via social media accounts, the inconvenience of accessing, for instance, a cable company's television content (by typing in your account number every time) from your mobile or tablet computer is reduced considerably. Considering how competitive the space is, and how fickle the consumer, this sort of attention to detail makes or breaks TVE.NimbleTV, before the acquisition, was busy taking the concept of TVE to the next level. On an entirely virtual platform, concentrated within the browser, NimbleTV could be used to access live or on-demand content from your normal cable subscription wherever you have web access. Meaning anywhere, globally.Eventually, NimbleTV decided that the money wasn't in direct-to-consumer products, but in ""technology ... for companies interested in boosting their streaming and TV viewing capabilities."" Technology that meshes very symbiotically with what Synacor already has.Already working with NimbleTV were Time Warner Cable (NYSE:TWX), Cablevision (NYSE:CVC), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and RCN.Already working with Synacor were Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH), Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR), HBO, CNN, and Cartoon Network. Oh, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Synacor's biggest partner.This seems to have been a strategically beneficial ""acqui-hire.""Low barrier to entrySynacor's balance sheet is pretty. The current ratio (mrq) of 2.31 is textbook. Debt-to-equity is 5.46%. Book value per share is $1.75. The share price is $2.38.As a micro-cap, worries of fragility come through in its limited customer base. Revenues come primarily from the ""Search & Advertising Revenues"" segment as opposed to ""Fee-Based Revenues."" Google, for instance, accounts for around 39% - 45% of total revenue. If that worries you, bear in mind that they have entered a mutually beneficial revenue-sharing agreement ending in February 2017, subject to renewal. If that still worries you, read the ""If all else fails"" section.Decreases in revenue are controlled. Negative cash flows are a to-be-expected artifact of a lack of focus and traditionally weak management. For precisely the circumstances that prompted this article, we expect to see these numbers turn around.If all else failsSynacor is an attractive takeover target, and becoming more so. Before the restructuring, a few activists took a stake in SYNC and demanded that it be sold. Given the balance sheet combined with uninspiring leadership, this should come as no surprise. They thought it would fetch a pretty penny, too:With happy partners like Google locked into three-year agreements and a high-visibility infrastructure among telecom behemoths, many have proposed SYNC as an acquisition over the years - even for the likes of Google. Shareholders could rest assured that such an arrangement, or one of many others, wouldn't be uncomfortable.The ""So What?""SYNC data by YChartsEventually, the subscription/fee-based revenues need to start growing relative to total revenue. Short of positive investor sentiment, this may be the first sign of a potential turnaround. We should be reassured that this is prominent on the agenda (from the most recent 10-Q):This is critical. Advertising revenues are cut in half by Synacor's sharing with customers. Fee-based revenues would not be subject to similar costs of revenue. A real end-to-end ""product"" would not be as fragile as home pages and ad revenue.If these fee-based revenues do become more dominant, SYNC has begun to move toward a real vertical, a real product, and real revenue. Can this happen?A leaner team and meaner management make it believable.A very promising strategic acquisition in NimbleTV makes it significantly easier.In the meantime, the small downside, small debt liabilities, near-to-book-value valuation, extended Google partnership, and takeover prospects should all help you sleep at night if you decide that this is an investment for you.We see a lot of potential value here, and we look forward to watching the restructuring and acquisition play out in the coming year.Note: We have contacted SYNC investor relations requesting commentary on the degree to which NimbleTV's technology stack will be integrated into Synacor's current subscription business - and what that might look like. We will attach commentary, pending response.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
2071443,25432,2014-03-07T09:09:54-05:00,"Synacor is misunderstood by investors.Synacor's TV Everywhere service offerings and strong balance sheet would make for a nice tuck in acquisition.Synacor announces CEO succession planning, a 3-year extension to advertising agreement with Google and a $5 million share buy back program.","Editors' Note: This article covers a stock trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less than a $100 million market cap. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.It was another quarter of tough comps and forward-looking guidance for Synacor (NASDAQ:SYNC). However, Synacor remains strategically positioned to be a key benefactor of the continued rollout of the TV Everywhere phenomenon.What does Synacor do? Its business is comprised of three main categories:For search and display advertising, Synacor builds and provides startpages for key telco customers. Examples of Synacor's lead pages look like this:Desktop/Laptop:Mobile / Cross-Device:Synacor then derives search revenue via the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) toolbar embedded in the startpage and through display advertising. I believe the transition to mobile, which is a headwind currently, will turn into a solid growth driver in future periods as adoption rates and new customers get onboard with Synacor's solutions.Customer concentration remains a risk, as Google makes up a substantial part of Synacor's revenue base. However, Synacor announced that it extended its agreement with Google for 3 years on the same terms as the current deal, so investors should be assuaged that one of Synacor's key revenue streams won't be disappearing. Investors should note that there were updates to Google's search partner standards early in 2013, mainly as a result of complaints of malware toolbars. Synacor clearly doesn't fall into that category, and is viewed as a solid partner to Google, as evidenced by the renewal of the search deal.However, headwinds do persist in the search business as users transition to mobile. Search and display revenue declined year/year in terms of absolute dollars ($24 million vs. $27.1 million) and search volume, yet rates per thousand impressions (""RPM"") increased fairly dramatically, up 10% year/year indicating some firming on pricing. The Synacor model is generally to drive search traffic for which Google compensates Synacor, who then shares the revenue with the owner of the startpage. It's a pretty solid, capital light business.Turning now to the subscription business, it continues to perform well generating $5.4 million, up from $5.1 million in the year ago quarter. Subscription services include email services for ""power users"" and cloud ID solutions, which simplifies the log in procedure for multiple TV Everywhere devices via social mediums like Google+, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). These are recurring revenues, and Synacor's solutions put them squarely in between content owners, telco customers, device manufacturers and users. Put differently, Synacor has multiple monetization opportunities given the growing reach of its TV Everywhere and startpage ecosystem.Where To Now?Revenue guidance for 2014 was suggested to be $100 to $105 million, down from 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was forecast at $2 to $5 million. While management guided down, I think it discounts the important growth initiatives in place. First, management has indicated on a number of calls that it focuses on product first; that is, it wants to get the product launch right, rather than focusing on quarterly, or yearly revenue estimates. To that end, outgoing CEO Ron Frankel mentioned this in reference to revenue guidance on the Q2 2013 call (transcript courtesy of Seeking Alpha):These comments were made half way through 2013, along with comments that revenue was generally delayed while products were being built. I also understand that Synacor has been building out its engineering teams in Toronto and Boston, indicating Synacor has a strong pipeline of projects likely coming through in 2014.With the recent acquisition of Carbyn (an HTML5 operating system for app development) and Teknision (a framework for Android app development), Synacor appears to be in the middle of the mobile revolution, specifically around TV Everywhere, social login and the potential to be the ""home screen"" for various OEM manufacturers to drive more search and display revenue.ValuationSynacor remains very cheap and trading at a distressed valuation. At its $75 million market capitalization before the close on March 5, 2014, shares were exchanging hands at less than book value and about 1.5x net current asset value. After backing out the company's $36 million in net cash, the enterprise value is sitting at about $40 million for a company that is projected to do $100 million in sales and which is rolling out a significant product pipeline in the first half of 2014 (according to management).Given these factors, I was encouraged by the $5 million share buyback program and I remain convinced that this business could be a takeover target in 2014. Who might want Synacor? I think two interesting takeover candidates could include Rovi Corporation (NASDAQ:ROVI) or even Google. The unique set of TV Everywhere assets and Cloud ID solutions fit in particularly well with both businesses. In particular, by buying Synacor, Google would relieve itself of sharing the search revenue, and would provide itself with some unique tools for its Google Play and YouTube content platforms.What is Synacor worth? It is hard to peg an exact figure, but I would venture to say ""more"" than it is currently trading. The subscription revenue with an annual run rate of $20 million is likely worth 3x sales, or $60 million. The remaining search business is hard to quantify given it is in a state of flux, but appears to be at an inflection point, especially as Synacor fills out its product offerings and works on monetizing its development efforts. For conservatism, I will assign a 0.5x sales figure to the search and advertising revenue stream, or about $40 million. Add in $36 million in net cash, and I think Synacor could be worth up to $175 million, suggesting a $5 stock price.ConclusionHave we reached the moment of capitulation for shares of Synacor? I would hope so.In my view, 2014 will be an interesting year of product rollouts and figuring out whether Synacor should remain a standalone company or be taken private. Management indicated its willingness to consider strategic transactions on the Q4 2013 conference call on March 5, and reminded the analysts that they remain stewards for shareholders. The outgoing CEO Ron Frankel remains a significant shareholder in the business, so I expect he wants to maximize the value of his shares as well.Time will tell, but I think Synacor is offering considerable value and limited downside after what I expect will be a rout in its share price tomorrow.Disclosure: I am long SYNC.

3980139,60321,2016-06-06T11:17:41-04:00,Synacor's partnership with AT&T that is worth upwards of $100 million a year upon full deployment changes everything.Synacor shares recently doubled on the heels of the AT&T contract announcement and I am actively hunting for an attractive entry point to take a position.Synacor's existing capital is anticipated to be sufficient to fund the investment necessary to support the new partnership with AT&T.,"Company Overview:Synacor (NASDAQ:SYNC) helps customers deliver relevant content to their consumers across all devices. Synacor's content reaches 120 million monthly visitors, 120 service providers, 3500 enterprises, 500 million email boxes and more than 1000 web publishers. Synacor delivers modern, multiscreen experiences and advertising to consumers through a B2B2C business model.Synacor May 2016 Investor Presentation Image SourceWhy Synacore Is On My Watch ListOn May 4th, Synacor announced a partnership with AT&T (NYSE:T) worth upwards of $100 million a year upon full deployment. Syncacor held the company's Q1 conference call on May 10th and provided some color behind the AT&T win, expected revenue and investment related to the contract.After the AT&T announcement there was some uncertainty whether Synacor had enough existing capital to fund the investment necessary to support the new partnership. Management provided an update during the Q1 conference call surrounding potential funding needs.At this point cash flows from operations are expected to be sufficient to pay for the estimated $10m investment set to occur over the next 12 months related to the AT&T partnership. Synacor ended Q1 with $15.7m of cash and generated $3.9m from operations in the first quarter. The $10m investment will be split 80/20 with $8m expected to hit in 2016 with $2m hitting in 2017.The $10m investment cost to support the AT&T partnership is primarily operating expense and is driven by the need to hire new talent on top of the 400 employees on the payroll today. My experience tells me that a majority of the costs of hiring new talent will be related to backfilling existing employees that will be assigned to the AT&T account. AT&T is the elephant in the room and will make up better than 30% of Synacor's annual revenue beginning as early as 2017 and it makes sense to service this customer with the company's best and brightest talent base.Synacor May 2016 Investor Presentation Image SourceDuring the Q1 conference call Synacor laid out the 3/30/300 plan that calls for $30m adjusted EBITDA, $300m revenue over the next 3 years (by 2019). The three financial goals laid out by management are very attainable, which makes shares of SYNC an attractive investment despite shares being up over 100% since the AT&T partnership announcement just last week.To put this 3/30/300 plan in perspective it is important to understand Synacor's business outlook prior to the AT&T contract award. Management guided FY2016 revenue between $125 million to $130 million without AT&T, which equates to a year-over-year growth rate of 16% from FY2015.The AT&T contract will hit in earnest in FY2017, but the full value of the $100m annual contract will only show a partial year in 2017 as Synacor beefs up staffing and prepares to service the account.However, if we focus on the 2019 revenue goal of $300m the company is already 75% of the way there with the current book of business running at an annual pace of $225m. Synacor will need to grow its existing book of business excluding AT&T by a 17% CAGR over the next 3 years to hit the $300m revenue by 2019.During the Q1 conference call Synacor also announced that the company signed a 3-year renewal with a major carrier. The renewal is most likely with Synacor's second biggest customer Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Verizon generated $25 million of revenue for Synacor in 2015 based on a review of the company's 10-K filing.The other 10% accounts for Synacor in addition to Verizon include CenturyLink (CTL) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). All together these three major accounts drove $53.5 million of revenue in 2015 and represented 49% of the book of business. The addition of AT&T will result in Synacor's the top 4 customers generating over $150m in revenue by 2017, which is nothing to sneeze at.The other important trend to understand is the revenue mix between recurring high margin repeatable revenue and fee-based revenue. In Q1 2016 recurring revenue grew 114% year-over-year ($13m versus $6.1m) and represented 43% of Q1 2016 revenue versus only 23% of Q1 2015.Growth in recurring revenue is important because it is repeatable, high margin and generates more net income than fee based revenue. The higher the mix of recurring revenue the higher the valuation SYNC should receive by sell-side analysts based on a price to sales valuation.Analysts assigned Synacor a price target of $0.7m of market cap for every $1m in sales based on FY2016 estimates. The contract by AT&T is worth between $50m and $75m towards Synacor's FY2017 revenue total.Assuming a modest growth rate of 10% for the existing book of business it is reasonable to assume that Synacor can produce between $185m and $210m of revenue in 2017. This also implies that the enterprise value is worth a minimum $130m and $147m or between $4.33 and $4.90 per share today.Conclusion:Synacor attracted a lot of attention from investors after the company landed a $100 million contract with AT&T, but this after a closer look SYNC has further upside despite rising over 100% since May 4th.Synacor is funding the estimated $10m investment related to the AT&T contract over the next 12 months from existing cash from operations and will see modest revenue contributions of $4 to $6m from AT&T in FY2016.In addition to signing AT&T to a $100m annual contract Synacor renewed a contract with a major carrier (Verizon) during the Q1 2016 that is worth $25m of annual revenue.Synacor continues to shift the overall business towards recurring high margin revenue versus lower margin fee based revenue. Synacor grew recurring revenue by 114% year-over-year in Q1 2016 versus Q1 2015 and has no plans to stop there.I believe sell-side analysts will take a closer look at the book of business and agree with our consensus that SYNC remains undervalued despite rising over 100% over the past several weeks. I don't have a position in Synacor, but I am closely following the price action on a daily basis and may initiate a position when the price is right.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

1398981,38181,2013-05-03T11:08:00-04:00,,"For those not familiar with how Synacor (NASDAQ:SYNC) has been manipulated, the stock first came into prominence in early May 2012 when it was profiled by the National Inflation Association (NIA) newsletter. I had previously written about how the NIA had relentlessly pumped up SYNC over the period of many months and caused its stock price to run up to highs of around $18, before coming back down and causing millions of dollars in losses for NIA followers.After hundreds of emails promoting SYNC, the NIA newsletter then moved on to promoting another stock, Concurrent Computer (CCUR). SYNC did what basically any pump-and-dump stock does once the promoter stops hyping it up: Its volume dropped to almost nothing, and its price fell even lower to below $3 (representing a roughly 80% loss for those who bought it at the highs when NIA was promoting it). But after checking the largest percentage gainers for May 1, 2013, I was surprised to see SYNC on the list, having gone up 22% on the day and seeing a surge in volume all throughout the trading day (over 5 million shares).The Catalyst for SYNC's RiseSYNC was a company that appeared to be sinking further and further, as its management had forecast revenues in 2013 far below analyst expectations and it failed to announce any major deals. But on May 1, SYNC announced news that investors obviously found very exciting, saying it has expanded its relationship with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to ""offer the company's nearly 5 million FiOS TV subscribers access to TV shows and movies from one online destination."" With SYNC's ""startpages,"" users can access content with just one log in and from one location, rather than having to search across multiple websites and channels. An example of a SYNC startpage can already been seen on Verizon's website. Users can search for a television show and have multiple results returned from multiple networks. Synacor VP and General Manager Michael Bishara commented as follows:The press release regarding SYNC's deal with Verizon does not state any dollar amounts, and I can only make guesses as to what kind of revenue SYNC will be earning from Verizon in future. However, I am inclined to believe (though I could be wrong) that SYNC's intraday moves on the day this news was released were excessive. SYNC has 27,300,000 outstanding shares, and at the high of the day on May 1 it rose to over $4 after closing the previous day at below $3. That represented an increased valuation of around $30 million, merely for providing a solution that allows Verizon subscribers to more easily search for TV shows.Even at SYNC's current price in the mid-$3s, it represents an increased valuation of around $15 million. History has shown that small-cap stocks with low volume that announce a deal with a huge company (even if it's for something fairly minor) can run up massively due to overexcited investors jumping in without properly understanding the news. I have to wonder if that's the case here.The Real Test for SYNC: EarningsSYNC will announce its Q1 2013 results on May 7, and that will give investors a better idea of the real health of this company. I do not expect the earnings to be encouraging, as SYNC management previously gave fairly low estimates. Also, any revenue earned from SYNC's new deal with Verizon will, of course, not be reported (Q1 represents only January to March). It will still be several months before SYNC's new revenue from Verizon will be reported in new income statements, and we will be able to see just how meaningful this new deal is.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1839282,41741,2013-11-14T09:43:55-05:00,,"InvestorsHub began voicing the Synacor (NASDAQ:SYNC) manipulation issue back in early 2012. At the center was NIA known as a pumper and dumper to some. NIA specializes in sending out newsletters to subscribers, trying to convince them to buy certain stocks. Synacor was one of their targeted names back in 2012.Before NIA started touting Synacor, the stock was trading at around $8 per share. And in a short three months, the stock more than doubled to $18. Oh, how things have changed. The stock now trades sub $3 per share.But since then the overhype has appeared to cool off. And now that the NIA overhang has filtered through, the market should begin to offer Synacor a more justifiable multiple.What's Synacor do?Synacor is a provider of startpages, TV Everywhere solutions, and other cloud-based services across multiple devices for cable, satellite, telecom and consumer electronics companies. Basically, Synacor allows its customers (which are major cable and telecom companies) the ability to deliver a wide range of online content and value-added services from multiple sources in a single, customizable, online location.Again, its key products are startpages and TV Everywhere. Startpages enable customers to combine entertainment, such as television shows, multi-player games and streaming music based on a subscriber's access rights and preferences with communications offerings such as voicemail, email, and third party messaging services like Yahoo Mail, Google's Gmail, MSN Hotmail, Facebook, and Twitter.For an example of one of Synacor's startpages visit here.Synacor startpage for WOW!Show me the moneySynacor's key revenue generators are search and display advertising, and subscriber-based fees for services. Specifically, Synacor uses Internet search and display advertising to generate revenue from traffic on its startpages. Its ad revenues are generated when consumers view and/or click on one of its graphic or video ads generated on its startpages.Its subscriber revenues are generated from fees for customers that want to use Synacor's technology and access to TV Everywhere and other services. All in all, ad revenues generate about 70% of revenues and subscriptions the rest.Survive and adaptYet, when you take the long-term view, the company appears to be hitting on all cylinders. Unique visitors grew from 8.2 million in 2010 to 20.4 million in 2012, and its advertising impressions jumped from 18.8 billion to 42.1 billion over the same time period.The real question that remains is whether the company can make the necessary moves to adapt to the changing environment and continue growing revenues. In brief, it appears, yes, they have some key initiatives that could prove to be very fruitful.The potential is thereSo, by all accounts, the company is still a revenue generating machine. The stock price simply got ahead of the company's performance. Irrational exuberance at its best. The biggest tailwind for the company is that consumers want access to their movies and TV shows in a single place.Hence, the increased ability to access the Internet everywhere is a big positive. This creates a new market for Synacor, where its customers will need to be able to access content online, including television programming, on tablets and mobile devices. So, one of its key revenue growth drivers will be thanks to more traffic on these devices.Synacor's SVP of Product and GM of TV Everywhere notes that ""watching TV is fun. Watching TV on our favorite mobile devices should be just as fun. In this era of hyper accessibility, the promise of TV Everywhere is seamless access to all the content and services consumers can imagine, anytime, anywhere and on the device of their choosing.""One headwind for the company is despite being on the market for more than a year, the Windows 8 OS continues to hamper the stock. The problem arises because Windows 8 automatically sets its own homepage ahead of pages that Synacor maintains for its clients.Total revenues came in at $122 million for 2012, but have compressed to $116 million for the TTM. The stock has remained under pressure as the revenue forecast continues to be revised downward and the failure to announce any new deals. 2013 should remain a transition year for Synacor, where its trying to mitigate the Windows 8 revenue impact, as well as investing in new products for mobile devices. And the company appears to be gaining momentum.Back in May the company announced it had expanded its Verizon relationship to ""offer the company's nearly 5 million FiOS TV subscribers access to TV shows and movies from one online destination."" The company got a slight pop in the stock, but that too was short lived.Synacor also recently snatched up Teknision, which is an Android development platform company. Teknision will allow Synacor's customers to deliver its services on Android devices, which goes a long way in allowing users to access all media from one place, on any device.Synacor CEO Ronald Frankel notes that ""Teknision will accelerate our [Synacor] efforts to give consumers a single point of access for all of their media, whether TV, movies, books, music or games. Whether the media is accessed from a tablet, laptop, smartphone or television, we intend to provide the intelligent home screen for all of them."" This move to get more active on mobile is a big positive for the company, and one that analysts have taken notice of, with a number of analysts upping their estimates for 2013 and 2014.Another initiative that adds more clout to Synacor's services is auto-authentication. This allows pay TV subscribers to access online video services by linking their content rights to their home router. Thus, as long as users are connected to their home network, they can bypass any sign-in process. And outside the home, subscribers can login with Facebook, Twitter or Google credentials and avoid having a separate login. And the big news of Synacor's auto-authentication products is that instead of competing with the likes of Comcast, it's targeting small to mid-sized cable operators.High level of customer concentration creates headwindsThe first headwind is the high level of customer concentration. For 2012, Synacor generated revenue from 45 customers. And what's more is that over 37% of revenues were from its top four customers, including CenturyLink, Charter, Verizon and Toshiba.Synacor also caters to the high-speed internet service providers that offer TV services. These customers of Synacor are facing increased competition from the likes of Google, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.com. As far as ad revenues, Google is its key partner, where ads via Google generated some 56% of revenues. There is a high degree of overreliance here.These are a couple things to consider, with the high level of exposure to Google being one of the most worrisome. The likes of Hulu and Netflix have been in the market for several years now, and Synacor has managed to fend off any major market share losses, however, any potential change in Google's search payments could have a meaningful (negative) impact on Synacor.The risk/reward is still very rewardingSynacor's strong balance sheet also provides downside protection. Synacor still has virtually no debt and a strong liquidity position, with a quick ratio that's 2.6x. With a strong liquidity position, the company has $1.27 in cash per share, which is 47% of its market cap. As well, it has $1.16 in net current asset value per share, or 44% of market cap.Synacor topped out during the month before Microsoft's official launch of Windows 8, even still, revenues have continued to grow over the last three years, going from $61 million in 2009 to $122 million in 2012. As well, adjusted EBITDA has grown from a negative $3.3 million in 2008 to $11.6 million in 2012. In 3Q, Synacor posted its 12th consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA.The internet information industry is trading with at an average 5x book value with a 23% debt to equity. Meanwhile, Synacor trades at 1.4x book value and has a debt to equity of only 5%. What's more is that Synacor trades at just under 28x earnings, while analysts project EPS to grow at 25% per annum over the next five years, putting its PEG ratio at a relatively low 1.1. The stock trades at only 0.6x sales and its EV/EBITDA multiple is only 4.4.Bottom lineAll in all, Synacor has quickly fallen from grace and is a classic case of irrational exuberance. The stock price, and ultimately valuation, got way ahead of the fundamentals, and recent concerns surrounding Windows 8 have only exacerbated the negative sentiment.However, the risk/reward appears to be very compelling and insiders still own 28% of the company. The stock now trades well below major tech peers and has a balance sheet built for growth (with nearly 50% of its market cap in cash). We likely will not see the days of Synacor trading above $15 for some time, however, it does appear that the fair value is closer to $4, which is still just 0.6x EV/sales and just over 2x book value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1009981,38181,2012-11-15T06:08:41-05:00,,"The ""National Inflation Association"" (NIA) is an ethically-questionable stock promotion newsletter that has now caused millions of dollars in investor losses with their recent promotions BVSN and SYNC. The NIA is run by Jonathan Lebed, an SEC-convicted stock manipulator who first came to prominence back in early 2001, when he was found guilty of artificially manipulating thinly-traded penny stocks by posting false news on message boards. This was just the beginning of Lebed's long career in stock manipulation, and well over a decade later he is still as active as ever in misrepresenting stocks and causing his followers to lose money on speculative investments.Lebed's latest score is Synacor Inc (NASDAQ:SYNC), which was first profiled by NIA on May 2nd 2012. The stock traded an impressive 3.62 million shares that day and closed over $10. The day before that it had traded less than half a million shares, so it's easy to respect the buying power that the NIA newsletter can bring in. In the two or three months since the NIA first profiled SYNC, the stock usually traded over ten million dollars worth of volume each day, which I regard as very impressive. And while SYNC did not do quite as well as BVSN (the past promotion from NIA), it did hit highs of around $18 in July, before coming all the way back down and then some. At the time of this article, SYNC is trading at just $5.12, roughly half the price when it was first profiled by NIA.It's true that there was plenty of money to be made trading SYNC as a result of NIA's promotional activities, and many intelligent traders did make money (either by going long at the beginning of the promotion, or shorting around the highs) - but the sad fact is that the losses from less-than-intelligent investors who held and hoped have been horrendous. On my stock analysis request form, I've had numerous enquires about SYNC, including from one NIA-subscriber who had lost over $60,000 by buying over $10, then blindly holding into Q3 earnings for no reason other than ""I've lost too much on this stock and can't afford to sell."" These cases are not uncommon. Given the volume and buying that took place in SYNC at its highs, there have to be more than a few horror stories. And the National Inflation Association newsletter is still going at it, trying to pump up SYNC and bring in buyers with an increasing air of desperation.It's been over 6 months since NIA sent its first email hyping up SYNC, and it's been ridiculous how many emails NIA have sent in total promoting this stock. In my Gmail inbox, which subscribes to the NIA newsletter, I have 367 emails from the NIA encouraging me to buy SYNC (plus 40 more which landed in the spam filter). That is a total of over four hundred SYNC promotional emails that the NIA has sent me since early May. Indeed, every minor piece of news that SYNC comes out with results in a plethora of hype-filled emails from the NIA urging its followers to buy. Those who suffered losses on SYNC ought to have asked themselves, why is the NIA pushing this stock so heavily? Is their only motive to make me money by recommending this great stock? Or are they trying to line their own pockets? In the finance industry, there is always an ulterior motive, and indeed the primary goal of the NIA newsletter is to make money for itself and not necessarily its subscribers.How Does The National Inflation Association (NIA) Make Money?While most stock promotion newsletters take cash payment to promote stocks, it seems that the NIA makes most of its money by buying large positions in the stocks it promotes, and then selling those shares into its subscribers after spiking the price up. This is the same kind of thing that Lebed was doing 13 years ago, but on a larger scale. I believe it's very possible that the NIA is also being paid by major shareholders of the stocks it promotes, although we can't be sure.In the case of BVSN (NIA's prior pump to SYNC), which went up well over 400% from when the NIA first profiled it, I believe the NIA made millions (or at least was up millions at some point) by buying a huge amount of shares in BVSN before the promotion and then selling after the stock had been artificially pumped up. There is big money involved here. NIA easily generates millions of dollars a day in volume to the stocks it promotes, and if they can take a large position in a stock and spike it up a whole lot, they can sell and net serious profits. Again, given Lebed's history of deception, it wouldn't surprise me if there was more to it than that (i.e. money under the table that isn't disclosed) but for now I'll just assume that NIA's primary business model is buying positions in stocks and hyping them up to its subscribers.While BVSN was a huge win for the NIA, it seems that SYNC was a complete and utter disaster for them. I believe the NIA has lost nearly $2,000,000 on this stock. If they had sold their entire position around the highs of $18, they would have made a lot of money, but they didn't. Instead the NIA held on to its SYNC shares all the way down to its current price of below $5. That's what their disclaimers across the 400+ SYNC emails reveal, and by law those must be factual. NIA has had a large position in SYNC ever since they first started promoting it and they still do have a very large position. If the NIA's disclaimers are to believed, NIA originally had a 350,000 share position in SYNC on the day it first promoted it (May 2nd), which they had purchased at an average price of $8.53. Later the NIA added to this position, owning a maximum of 497,799 shares, and now they own 486,035 shares. According to their disclaimers the NIA has held 486,035 shares of SYNC since August 26th.If the NIA still has this huge 486,035 share position in SYNC, and the stock has downtrended heavily (both in price and volume), it's hardly surprising that they are desperately trying to pump this stock back up again. At this stage I believe the NIA would resort to any means necessary to make some of their money back. Whether or not they believe SYNC really is as great a company as they say it is, is irrelevant. Unfortunately for the NIA, it's clear that their efforts are yielding diminishing returns, as the majority of their subscribers have presumably already been bombarded with SYNC promotional emails and are no longer receptive. But they have certainly done an enormous amount of promotional work on SYNC and are probably going to continue for some time.FACT: The NIA Has Misrepresented SYNC, And Will Continue To Do SoEven after learning of Lebed's dark history of stock manipulation, and of the fact that the NIA has a 486,035 share position in SYNC and is thus heavily motivated to try to spike the stock up, there are people who will deny that the NIA has lied or manipulated SYNC. A truly great, undervalued stock does not slowly downtrend from around $18 to less than $5 in the space of a few months. There are only two possibilities: either the NIA was dead-wrong about SYNC, or they were lying the whole time. The NIA has come up with a number of excuses for SYNC's lackluster performance, including ""illegal"" short sellers (the standard pathetic excuse from promoters), the share lock-up expiration (where NIA claimed that certain venture capital funds in SYNC would sell after August 13th in order to raise capital, and that this had an unnatural bearish influence on the stock), lack of awareness among prolific investors and so on. None of these explanations are even close to convincing. SYNC stock has done badly for a simple reason, and that is that the company is not performing well.SYNC released their Q3 results on October 24th, and since then the stock dropped a further 35% before its slight rebound on Wednesday. Why? Because SYNC's profits have been declining, with the company reporting Q3 net income of just $0.02/share (down from $0.07/share in 2011). Those interested in discovering SYNC's fair valuation can research the matter themselves, but there are a number of problems the company faces that the NIA never mentions, such as the fact that SYNC derives the majority of its revenue from a very small customer base, and that with the move to smartphones SYNC's revenue is taking a serious hit. Refer to the following links:The focus of this article is not whether or not SYNC is currently fairly valued around $5. It's quite possible that SYNC will rebound now that it has fallen so much, or it could continue dropping. The important thing to understand is that the NIA has grossly misrepresented the health of SYNC stock to its substantial subscriber base, and caused some horrible investor losses as a result.How The NIA Builds Its Subscriber BaseHow is the NIA able to bring in so much volume to stocks like SYNC? I cannot know all the ways in which the NIA has built up their subscriber base (although I'm very curious), but it seems that much of their traffic comes from the videos that they upload to their NIA YouTube channel. NIA links to their website and encourages visitors to signup in the description box for all their YouTube videos, many of which have a large number of views. In the popular video ""National Inflation Association co-founder admits NIA is a FRAUD"" (worth watching in its entirety), an ex-NIA associate estimates that the NIA spends around $30,000 to $40,000 per video on YouTube advertising, on top of production costs. I've also noticed text advertisements on YouTube for NIA's website, inflation.us, although I would think the number of subscribers brought in from these ads is relatively minor. Currently, NIA's YouTube channel has over 42,000 subscribers, and their videos have millions of views in total. I can only make wild guesses as to how many newsletter subscribers the NIA has.The NIA builds credibility for itself by producing professional thought provoking documentaries and branding itself as a political-commentary newsletter, and the majority of NIA-subscribers who enter their email and join the newsletter surely do not suspect that it's actually being primarily run by an SEC-convicted stock manipulator. I very much doubt the NIA is really interested in influencing political ideology or helping Americans ""prepare for inflation"". It is my belief that the newsletter exists only to pump up stocks, which they do very well.What's In Store For The NIA and SYNC?It looks like the NIA is going to continue promoting SYNC for some time, as if the 400+ emails already sent have not already been sufficient. After that, assuming the newsletter keeps running, the NIA will probably come out with a new stock promotion sometime, which will very likely crash at some point just like all of Lebed's past stock promotions. A lot of money will be made from those who understand how the game works, and a lot of money will be lost. As the popular saying from PT Barnum goes, ""there's a sucker born every minute."" Don't be a sucker. Understand that the NIA is only trying to make money for themselves, and don't hold their picks long term. It's my hope that by writing this article I can help at least a few people save their money and not get taken in by these schemes.If you have any questions about this article or anything else, feel free to contact me.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

949701,29461,2012-10-25T10:36:18-04:00,,"Synacor Inc. (NASDAQ:SYNC), a provider of online content to various telecom and electronic companies, reported its results for the third quarter yesterday, after the market closed. Since the earnings release, the stock has dipped by 4%. In our last report, we mentioned that despite impressive growth in revenues, the stock has a limited upside potential, as much of its growth has already been priced in. On the basis of the latest released results, we reiterate our previous stance.The company ended the quarter with yet another double-digit growth in revenues. In the quarter, it generated a staggering 18% growth in its overall revenues; however, that growth in revenues failed to trickle down to its bottom line, which shrunk by approximately 50%. The company's earnings dropped to $0.7 million; SYNC reported earnings per share of $0.02 as compared to EPS of $0.07 a year ago. It seems like the company's growth in revenues and earnings is slowing down, and is evident from viewing its results for the previous few quarters. In the second quarter, SYNC's revenues jumped by 60%, while its earnings grew by 50% YoY. Moreover, the company hasn't provided any positive earnings surprise since the first quarter, and to make things worse, its earnings have dropped for the first time since its IPO in the first half of the year.The company derives the majority of its revenues from search and display advertising, which has shown sound growth over the last few quarters; however, it is apparent that growth is slowing down. In the second quarter, revenues from search and display advertising grew by 70%, and by the end of the third quarter, that growth has slowed down to 24%. Moreover, subscription based revenues have tumbled too for the first time, decreasing by approximately 2% over the third quarter of 2011.Key Business MetricsThe company has identified three business metrics against which its operational performance can be judged; these are unique visitors, search queries and advertising impressions. The company averaged 20 million unique visitors per month in the third quarter, more or less flat on a sequential basis. Deterioration was also seen in the total search queries, which declined to 234 million as compared to the 238 million search queries in the second quarter, representing a 2% decline. Growth was only seen in the advertising impressions, which grew to 11.6 billion as compared to 8 billion in the third quarter of the previous year.Overall, the company's quarterly results were disappointing, despite the growth in revenues, as it didn't produce a similar growth in earnings due to higher costs arising from its revenue sharing arrangements with its customers, which include Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and CenturyLink (CTL), among a few others. Research and development expenses incurred related to the maintenance of its technological platforms, as well as general and administrative expenses, also played a part in the company reporting lower earnings. Both research and development and administrative expenses jumped up 25% and 47%, respectively, in the third quarter.Guidance CutAt the end of the second quarter, the company announced that it expects revenues for the full year to be in the range of $123 million-to-$126 million; however, it has now cut its guidance, and is expecting revenues to be in the range of $120 million-to-$122.8 million, which further confirms our opinion that the company's growth in revenues is not sustainable.The stock is down 56% since our last report on SYNC. SYNC is trading at 18 times its forward earnings, which is a premium of 50% and 100% over its peers Digital River Inc. (NASDAQ:DRIV) and Web.com Group, Inc. (WWWW). On an EV/EBITDA basis, the stock looks overvalued as well, with an EV/EBITDA of 14x as compared to DRIV's 3.2x.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Telecom Analyst.

751311,29461,2012-07-26T09:29:42-04:00,,"Synacor Inc. (SYNC), a provider of online content and services to various telecom and electronic companies, reported its second quarter results on July 25, 2012. After announcing the results, the company's stock dipped over 10% in after-hours trading. In a previous piece on SYNC, we recommended a short position on the stock, and we reiterate our previous stance supported by the 19% drop since we last discussed the company.SYNC posted earnings of $1.2 million, compared to $0.6 million in 2Q2011, which represents a 50% increase. Revenues in the quarter rose almost 60% to $30.8 million from the previous year's quarter. Despite the impressive increase in both revenues and earnings, the company was unable to give any meaningful earnings surprise, unlike the first quarter, when the earnings surprise came in at almost 30%. The table below sets out the actual results versus the consensus expectations.The company derives a majority of its revenues from its Search and Display advertising, which has experienced staggering growth since the company's IPO in February. An increase in the number of end consumers for its clients, like CenturyLink (CTL), is helping boost the company's revenues. In the second quarter, the company generated $25.4 million of revenues through its Search and Display advertising business, which is an improvement of almost 70% from the same quarter of the previous year.The company's other revenue source, subscription-based services, saw an improvement from the prior year quarter as well, generating $5.4 million in revenues, up almost 20% from 2Q2011. The company has identified three key business metrics relating to internet usage, search and advertising, against which its performance can be analyzed, namely unique visitors, search queries and advertising impressions. In the quarter recently ended, all three metrics improved compared to the previous year's quarter, as indicated by the table below.Despite the improvement in all key metrics for the company in 2Q2012, as compared to 2Q2011, advertising impression is the only metric that showed an improvement compared to the first quarter of the current year, while search queries and unique visitors both dropped sequentially.Going forwardThe company has already warned that with the introduction of smartphones and their increasing usage, its largest revenue source (Search and Display advertising) can be adversely affected. Currently, the company depends on customers using the internet on their computers. As more and more consumers switch to using the internet through their smartphones using applications other than internet browsers, its sales could be adversely impacted. It is probable that the rise in smartphone users has led to the sequential quarterly decline in the total search queries and unique visitors. As at June, 2012, SYNC had only 45 customers, and out of the 45, only four customers (Verizon (VZ), Toshiba, CenturyLink, Qwest (Q)) accounted for more than 70% of the company's revenues. This overdependence on a small customer base, as well as possible loss of business from any of the above mentioned names, could potentially affect the company's profitability.Overall, SYNC's quarterly results were impressive, with improvements seen in revenues, EBITDA and earnings. However, since we last analyzed the company, its stock has dropped almost 19%. In our previous discussion, we mentioned the stock's strong performance since its February IPO, however, we also suggested that much of the growth that the company has shown has already been priced in. Perhaps the most disappointing feature of its quarterly results announcement was its third quarter guidance being below analyst estimates. The company announced that it expects full year revenues to be near the low-end of the $123 million-$126 million range, and quarterly revenues to be between $28 million-$28.5 million. Full year and quarterly revenue expectations were $125.3 million and $30.6 million.The stock is trading at a forward one year P/E multiple of 34x, which is at a premium of 177% and 270% over its peers Digital River Inc (DRIV-OLD) and Web.com Group, Inc. (WWWW). Moreover, SYNC's EV/EBITDA (38x) is also at a hefty premium to DRIV's 3.77x.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
848571,29461,2012-09-05T19:07:59-04:00,,"Since our previous recommendation, Synacor (NASDAQ:SYNC) is down 45%. It provides online content and authentication services to its customers that include cable companies, telecom operators, and consumer electronics companies. Through its platform, it helps its customers deliver popular content across multiple devices. It has a market capitalization of $215 million with 27 million shares outstanding. Currently, the stock is trading near $8 on the Nasdaq. Since its IPO in February 2012, which took place at $5, the stock has appreciated considerably. In our last report on Synacor, we mentioned the company's impressive growth in revenues and earnings. However, we suggested that much of this growth has already been priced in by the market, and that it has a limited upside potential.The company reported its second-quarter results July 25, generating revenues of almost $31 million and earnings of $1.2 million, which -- even though it was an improvement from the previous quarter -- did not result in any positive earnings surprise. As mentioned previously, the company obtains its revenues from search and display advertising. It also generates revenues from subscription-based services. Three key metrics against which the company's performance can be appraised are unique visitors, search queries and advertising impressions, which all improved as compared to the previous quarter. However, on a sequential basis they declined, with the exception of advertisement impressions.In our previous report on the company, we mentioned the company's overdependence on a very small customer base, and we believe that this factor continues to be a major threat to the company's business going forward. For example, Charter and CenturyLink (CTL) together provided almost 60% of Synacor's revenue stream in the year ended 2010. If we add Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and Toshiba to the above mentioned names, total revenues attributable to the four companies becomes almost 75% for the six months ended 2012. Even though the company has contracts extending over a period of one to three years, in a scenario where few of these contracts are not renewed, the company can take a significant hit on its revenue stream, which could be detrimental to its profitability.Another problem the company faces is that with more and more consumers using smartphones and tablets for their Internet needs, rather than PCs, the company's profitability can be adversely affected. Even though the company has taken steps in the right direction with its recent acquisition of Carbyn, it is still not offering customers a wide range of non-browser services.The company's stock has attracted a lot of speculation as well, especially when a website started pumping the stock to be undervalued, and with good growth potential. Shortly after, Jonathan Lebed also declared Synacor to be his No. 1 pick of 2012.Despite the strong results posted by the company, the stock has lost almost 35% of its value since the earnings release, which is due to the downward revision of the quarterly as well as full-year guidance. The company is now expecting third-quarter revenues to be in the range of $28 million to $28.5 million, below analyst expectations of $30.6 million. Third-quarter EBITDA guidance of $2 million to $2.5 million also fell short of EBITDA expectations of $2.9 million. Synacor is trading at 61 times its earnings, which is a significant premium to the industry's 19 times. Forward P/E of 24 times is also higher than the forward multiples of Digital River (NASDAQ:DRIV-OLD) (14 times) and Web.com Group (WWWW) (9 times).

Zimbra offers white-label email hosting, security and collaboration services to over 4,000 enterprises, governments and non-profit customers powering approximately 530 million mailboxes. Cloud ID offers an improved login experience for consumers using single sign-on technology that unlocks access to online entertainment like TV shows, movies and sports across multiple devices. Revenue from this segment represents the majority of Synacor’s recurring revenue which makes up about 48% of 2018 revenues (excluding ATT.net).The managed Portals and Advertising division accounts for 52% of 2018 revenues (excluding ATT.net). This segment provides customers with the opportunity to monetize the traffic attracted to their website through the normal course of business (e.g. customers logging into their accounts to pay bills etc…). Synacor’s portal services tries to establish the customers’ website as a daily destination by delivering relevant content such as news headlines, search capability, stock market quotes and entertainment options. Traffic is monetized through search and digital advertising and syndicated content and Synacor shares a portion of this revenue with their customers.On July 11, 2019, Synacor announced that it planned to begin discussions with AT&T (T) regarding the wind-down of its contract to run AT&T’s consumer facing portal ATT.net. Though disappointing, it was not unexpected as AT&T had delivered notice to Synacor in August 2018 to prevent the automatic renewal of its contract. AT&T will instead partner with Verizon (VZ) who already powers AT&T’s email service through Yahoo. The portal receives between 30 million to 40 million monthly visitors and Synacor splits the search (Google enhanced search bar located at the top of the opening webpage) and advertising revenue with AT&T.Source: Synacor press releaseIronically, Synacor won the AT&T portal business from Yahoo in May 2016 because Verizon was seen as a potential acquirer of Yahoo, a transaction that transpired in July 2016. Synacor spent USD10 million to support AT&T but never came close to reaching the USD100 million in annual revenue it touted initially. In Q1 2019, ATT.net represented USD9.3 million out of USD20.7 million Portal and Advertising segment revenues. Synacor’s FY2018 revenues adjusted to exclude ATT.net are shown above. Synacor’s reported FY2018 revenue was USD143.9 million versus USD102 million excluding ATT.net which implies USD41.9m of ATT.net revenue.CEO Himesh Bhise emphasized management’s focus on profitability with a focus on its higher margin recurring revenue software business and publisher based advertising business. In terms of the ATT.net portal wind-down and migration, the process should take several months but AT&T is pushing for a conclusion this year. In Q2 2019, without ATT.net, Synacor’s Portal and Advertising segment recorded revenues of USD11.6 million. Management expanded their overall guidance ranges for Q3 2019 and FY2019 to account for a range of AT&T outcomes to:The publisher based advertising business continues to do well with the number of publisher users growing 18% year-over-year. The software platform remains strong with Synacor adding 103 new Zimbra customers in Q2 2019 and bookings with 220 customers. New customers include Philippines based Asia United Bank, a Spanish public broadcaster and a European Police Prefecture. Synacor continues to add committed service providers to its Zimbra X cloud-based email and collaboration platform including PenTeleData and ACTi in the quarter. Cloud ID added four multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPDs) through a reseller relationship with ETI Software Solutions.Source: Synacor Q2 2019 press releaseAs shown in the table above, Synacor remains a work-in-progress with both segment’s revenues declining 7.5% for H1 2019 versus H1 2018. This does not even exclude the ATT.net business. Management claims this is due to the short-term effects of transitioning into a collaboration and identity SaaS business. This involves migrating its Zimbra platform to a recurring revenue model and expanding Cloud ID to more applications. Underneath the surface, recurring software revenue grew 7% year-over-year on a 12 month trailing basis. Though management likes to highlight the Software and Services as a 25%+ adjusted EBITDA margin business, this excludes unallocated corporate G&A expenses and margins would clearly be much lower on a standalone basis.Source: Seeking AlphaSynacor is trading at an enterprise value of about USD47 million. Taking the 2018 Software and Services segment recurring revenues of USD35.8 million implies a very low 1.3x multiple for such a business so the market seems to be attributing almost no value to the Portal and Advertising segment. This looks very cheap but there are a number of concerns:On the Q2 2019 earnings call, management downplayed the loss of the AT&T portal contract spinning it as an opportunity to improve margins, pursue higher quality revenues and accelerate Synacor’s transformation towards a SaaS based software company. Over the last 5 years current share price levels have marked a floor and it could be a low point once again if efforts to drive profitability and highlight the more attractive recurring revenue parts of the business are successful. 180 Degree Capital (TURN) CEO Kevin Rendino joined the Synacor board effective March 01, 2019 and this should bring some much needed shareholder friendly insights. Additional key performance indicator disclosure with multi-year tends would go a long way to help investors appreciate the recurring revenue elements of Synacor’s business.Additional disclosure: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

711711,23843,2012-07-10T10:36:13-04:00,,"The stock of Synacor (SYNC) is currently experiencing strong short term performance in an otherwise weak market. While many investors and day traders are attracted to the relative strength, they should be warned that the stock appears to be currently in the late stages of a pump and dump operation led by Jonathan Lebed and the National Inflation Association. Lebed is a newsletter writer whose activities recently led to BroadVision (BVSN) appreciating from the mid $8 range to $50 per share, but as this article and this article presciently warned, this was merely the prelude to a near 80% stock price collapse.The BroadVision promote was based on the false premise that BroadVision was a legitimate competitor to Jive and Yammer in the enterprise social networking space, although cursory research revealed that BVSN had virtually no traction with its ClearVale product and unlike a legitimate high growth enterprise had experienced multiple years of sales declines. The SYNC promote is based on the dubious premise that Synacor is a leader in the ""TV Everywhere"" market and the London Olympics will be a catalyst for the company's financial performance. In reality, the bulk of Synacor's business is providing search and display advertising on the home web pages that are set up by default when you sign up for high speed Internet services or purchase a new computer from one of their clients. As you might imagine, the usage of these home pages is arguably undergoing a secular decline as sophisticated Internet users set their default homepages to more useful sites and Internet users increasingly use tablets or smartphones (which do not automatically default to a service provider homepage) to access the Internet.While Synacor is indeed providing authentication services for TV subscribers to access online video feeds for the London Olympics, this type of revenue is only a very small portion of Synacor's total. Such revenue is included in SYNC's ""subscriber-based"" revenue which was only $4.5M or 31% of sales in the March quarter) and it is even provided at a nominal or no additional charge to some customers. In short, I doubt the London Olympics will have a material impact on SYNC's revenue, and even if it did the recent gains in the stock far outpace any conceivable revenue benefit and no serious investor would place undue importance on what will be a fleeting event. At the end of the day, SYNC's business is driven by its acquisition of new service provider or computer homepage customers. Barring any major new customer additions (and contrary to recent assertions Dish has been a customer for a while), SYNC's revenue growth is projected to slow to the low teens rage by the end of the year. Indeed, in 2010 SYNC only grew by 8%.So while this time Lebed and the NIA have chosen a somewhat more fundamentally sound company for their promotion activities, SYNC has a serious issue that BVSN did not, namely the huge amount of shares that may flood the market in less than a month. The classic newsletter pump and dump operation involves quietly accumulating a block of an illiquid stock, then making over-the-top bullish pronouncements to generate retail investor interest and trading volume. If the stock is liquid and the trading is dominated by institutions, the incremental interest is not enough to move the stock. SYNC is illiquid by virtue of the fact that it is a recent IPO with a relatively small float. At the time of Synacor's original IPO filing in November of 2011, the rumor was the company hoped to price the IPO at $8 to $10 per share. However, due to a lack of institutional interest in a company that essentially makes Internet service provider home pages that most sophisticated Internet users ignore, the underwriters were forced to lower the IPO range to $5 to $6. SYNC's IPO eventually priced at the $5.00 low end of the range.Even at this lower price, insiders were willing to sell up to 2.0 million shares including the overallotment option out of a total offering of around 8M shares. However, there are 25.6M total shares outstanding after the offering, meaning that an additional 17.6M shares will be eligible for sale 180 days from February 10th, assuming SYNC's Q2 earnings have been released by then. I calculate the lock-up expiration as approximately August 8th.Normally a stock that appreciated strongly subsequent to an IPO would be a candidate for a managed secondary offering by the investment banks that brought it public. However, this assumes that the appreciation resulted from genuine institutional investor interest or blow-out financial results, not appreciation generated by a retail stock newsletter. Since institutions were reluctant to participate at SYNC's IPO at $6.00 per share, I doubt they would participate at anything near the current $17.00 price, meaning that company insiders and previous investors will have to sell in the open market. Based on their willingness to sell stock at $5.00 per share just a few months ago, it is hard to imagine they are not eager to sell as rapidly as possible, which has the potential to rapidly deflate the share price as the supply/demand equation flips.Compared to the 17.6M shares about to come off lock-up, the 500 thousand-ish shares that the NIA says it owns are a drop in the bucket. I believe it is no coincidence that the NIA's self-imposed holding period is expiring shortly before the insiders' lock-up and I doubt the NIA dumb enough to hold their shares into this veritable tsunami of new stock supply. In fact, while the NIA touts the potential for SYNC to exceed analyst estimates when they report financial results later on this month, I believe at the current inflated price it simply does not matter whether this happens or not. According to my calculations SYNC is trading at 42x EV/EBITDA based on 2012 results, and 27x based on my projections for 2013. These multiples are substantially greater than Internet industry leaders including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) (about 21x 2013E EBITDA), let alone Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  (less than 7x). I think a fair price for SYNC is closer to $7.00, or 10x 2013E EBITDA. This would still be up 40% from the February IPO. Once momentum traders exit the stock and the float increases several times, the collapse could be greater, especially in a difficult market environment. Until then, day traders and retail investors can have fun passing the stock back and forth among themselves, hoping they wont' be the ones left holding the bag. I'm sure those that bought BVSN in the high teens, twenties, thirties and forties hoped the same thing.Disclosure: I am short SYNC."
354231,24145,2012-02-09T11:59:20-05:00,,"Based in Buffalo, New York, Synacor (NASDAQ:SYNC) scheduled a $75 million IPO with a market capitalization of $282 million at a price range mid-point of $11 for Friday, February 10, 2011SYNC is one of nine IPOs scheduled for this week (see our IPO calendar).SUMMARYIt looks like Synacor (SYNC) has established a critical mass in an emerging area: packaging and bundling content and services from content providers to branded Internet customers who have large customer bases.SYNC provides this private label, ""white box"" behind the scenes services to companies who want to offer a broad range of steaming internet content, to compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Hulu, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others.OBSERVATIONSAfter a string of yearly losses SYNC finally achieved modest profitability in the March 2011 quarter, with significant sequential revenue increases in the September and December quarter respectively of 23% and 20% (quarter over quarter) to $29 million and $24million respectively.CONCLUSIONWithout taking the quarterly improvement since December 2010 SYNC seems overpriced. However, if the rate of top line revenue increases continues and SYNC continues to show quarterly profits the stock could do well over time.We are, therefore, favorably inclined towards SYNC, although would not be surprised to see it price below range or at the bottom of the price range.One drawback to an higher valuation is that SYNC does not have end user branding under its own name.BUSINESSSynacor's mission is to ensure that its customers are increasingly valuable to their end-consumers.Synacor's customer-branded, integration and authentication platform enables cable, satellite, telecom and consumer electronics companies to deliver digital entertainment, services and apps to their own consumers, thereby strengthening those relationships while monetizing engagements.With 45+ customers, 21 million high-speed Internet households, 81+ million average monthly search queries, 2.8 billion average monthly advertising impressions, and 70+ content partnerships, Synacor delivers a compelling consumer experience across multiple devices.REVENUE MODELSYNC's customers direct consumers to their branded websites, which comprise the consumer-facing components of SYNC's platform, where consumers have access to the online content and services available to them at their respective subscription levels.SYNC monetizes the online traffic generated by these consumers through search and display advertising. The company also charges fees for value added services delivered through SYNC's platform.TRAFFIC STATS ARE UPSYNC has historically experienced growth in the number of consumers whose online traffic can generate search and display advertising revenues through SYNC's platform.The number of these consumers who are subscribers through SYNC's high-speed Internet customers has increased from 5.2 million in December 2006 to 9.5 million in December 2009 to 21.8 million in December 2011.These subscribers, along with other consumers, such as those attributable to SYNC's consumer electronics manufacturer customer, have driven a 127% increase in average monthly unique visitors to customers' websites, a 118% increase in average monthly search queries by consumers on SYNC's platform and a 77% increase in average monthly advertising impressions, each on a comparative quarterly basis from the first quarter of 2010 through the end of 2011.MARKET OVERVIEWAccording to a June 2011 report published by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC, from 2006 through 2010, high-speed Internet penetration (measured on a household basis) has increased substantially both within the United States and globally, from 46% and 18% to 69% and 34%, respectively.This represents an increase from 50 million subscribers with high-speed Internet to 79 million subscribers in the United States, and from 248 million subscribers to 490 million subscribers globally. Individuals are spending more time online driven by a growing selection of online services, higher bandwidth speeds, the increased amount of content available online and the societal shift towards virtual socialization.FASTER, BETTER, CHEAPERHigh-speed Internet service providers have continuously upgraded their networks in recent years, providing users with significantly faster connection speeds and enabling online access through multiple types of devices, thus reinforcing and enabling the growth in Internet usage.These higher speeds and increased number of platforms have resulted in an increased number of services available online. In addition, the proliferation of new types of connected mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, has enabled consumers to increase the amount and type of content they consume online. Rapid innovations in technology have made it possible for users to easily transition between smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktops, thereby significantly increasing the total amount of time spent online and the quality of the viewing experience.TRENDSSYNC's customers, who are predominantly high-speed Internet service providers that also offer television services, are facing increasing competition from companies that deliver video content over the Internet, more commonly referred to as ""over-the-top,"" or OTT.These new competitors include a number of large and growing companies, such as Google , Netflix , Hulu, and Amazon . With the increased availability of high-speed Internet access and over-the-top programming, consumers' video content consumption preferences may shift away from current viewing habits.As a result, many of SYNC's customers and potential customers are compelled to find new ways to deliver services and content to their consumers via the Internet. SYNC expects this pressure to become even greater as more video content becomes available online. SYNC expects to continue to benefit from this trend as customers adopt the platform to package and deliver video programming and other related authentication services on their own branded websites.Another trend is the proliferation of Internet-connected devices, especially mobile devices. Smartphones, tablets and connected TVs have made it more convenient for consumers to access services and content online, including television programming.To remain competitive, SYNC's customers and potential customers must have the capability to deliver their services and products to consumers on these new devices. SYNC's platform enables them to extend their presence beyond traditional personal computers, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenue growth will come from traffic on these devices.SYNC's platform creates a revenue stream for its search advertising partner, Google, and SYNC's advertising network partners, who provide SYNC with advertisements and share in the fees generated by those advertisements when SYNC deliver them with search results and other content on customers' websites.COMPETITIVE STRENGTHSSYNC provides a white-label solution that, unlike the co-branded approach of most of competitors, creates a consumer experience that reinforces customers' and partners' brands.SYNC gives customers control over the sign-on process and billing function for a wide range of Internet services and content by integrating with their internal systems (where applicable) thereby allowing SYNC customers to ""own the consumer.""SYNC allows each customer to fashion websites that are specifically tailored to their desired ""look and feel.""COMPETITIONSYNC faces competition at three levels:In addition, SYNC competes with companies such as Facebook, Yahoo! (YHOO), Google, AOL (NYSE:AOL) and MSN (NASDAQ:MSFT), which have destination websites of their own or are capable of delivering competing platforms with content and service offerings similar to SYNCs.SYNC also competes with providers of paid content and services over the Internet, especially companies with the capability of bundling paid content and value added services in much the same manner as SYNC.These companies include ESPN3, F-Secur, Exent Technologies, Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), MLB Advanced Media, Symantec (SYMC), McAfee, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).In some cases SYNC has performed software integrations with these companies on behalf of customers or, as in the case of F-Secure and Exent, SYNC has partnered with them in order to offer their services more broadly to all of SYNC's customers.EMPLOYEESAs of December 31, 2011, SYNC had 260 employees in the United States and 1 employee in the United KingdomUSE OF PROCEEDSSYNC expects to net $53 million from the IPO by selling 5.5 million shares. Stockholders intend to sell 1.36 million shares. SYNC intends to use the IPO proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposesDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
710881,21815,2012-07-10T06:18:07-04:00,,"You have to give it to Jonathan Lebed. He and the ""National Inflation Association"" (they're basically the same, as we explained in our exposé on BroadVision). They took a company, BroadVision, Inc. (NASDAQ:BVSN) that was shrinking revenues for over a decade and promoted it from $8 to above $50 - on the basis of only hype.That company has now fallen back, but for some time, Lebed and co. have a new target, a company called Synacor (NASDAQ:SYNC). We have already argued that unlike BroadVision, Synacor actually holds a great deal of promise. The company offers solution for monetizing digital content over the internet on multiple devices. It's basically a hosted service for companies that want to put video online.To do that is complicated and costly. One needs streaming servers and keep files in different formats as no single format works for all devices. So it's no wonder that companies want to outsource these trouble to the likes of Synacor. The company has a rather unique business model in offering these services for free, but making money from search-and-display advertising instead.Since broadband penetration and speeds keep increasing and ever more devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.) have turned into video consumption 'terminals,' there is a significant growth opportunity here, there is little doubt about that.And the figures testify this. The last quarter (Q1 2012) saw Synacor log in a 64% revenue increase on last year's quarter and a whopping 200% increase in EBITDA year on year (y/y). Little surprise that management raised full year revenue guidance to $123M-126M, and they might well beat even that.The company gained an interesting order since for its TV Everywhere platform (which has a different model, working on a subscriber base, rather than with advertisement money), serving as an authentication agent for streaming the London Olympic Games for 35 distributors like Dish and Charter.Receivers of Jonathan Lebed and or the National Inflation Association newsletters will be well aware of this, as it has been screaming from the pages of those newsletters for quite a while. And indeed, that hasn't done the stock price any harm:Click to enlargeThe company set a new all-time high of $15.75 Friday. It closed at $15.45, an increase of 12.7% on what can only be described as a very bleak market, no mean achievement for sure. Certainly if you consider that the stock price is now at least 50% over most analyst 12-18 month target ($10).The company is pretty expensive. Analysts on average expect earnings per share at just 16 cents this year, giving the company a price-earnings ratio of nearly 100. Next year, they expect 38 cents per share in profit, still a steep valuation.Now, you might say that these profit expectations don't include the latest deal, but as significant as the deal is, we're not at all convinced that it is equally big in monetary terms. The Olympic Games deal speaks of authentication only, while the client numbers are likely to be big, the pay per client won't be. Even though, we agree that it's a pretty significant deal.But not as significant as Lebed alleges in one of his promotion mails:Trading over $50, we don't know about that. What we do know is that we wouldn't bet against Lebed and co. They are able to make stocks defy gravity for at least a considerable amount of time, and that with Synacor, they've got a real promising company in their hands, even if it's very richly valued already.There were 2.8M shares short (June 15) out of a float of 7.9M, and these holders must be twisting and turning in the wind a bit. It's too early to join them, although this party isn't going to last forever.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
654451,21815,2012-06-12T15:05:22-04:00,,"Shares in cloud media company Synacor (NASDAQ:SYNC) have been very strong lately. We'll assess what's going on and wonder whether it is too late to get in, or if there are other profitable trading strategies.What do they do?The best description comes from the latest Quarterly filing:The company is probably most known for their TV Everywhere platform, which enables customers (of cable companies, telecoms, satellite and consumer electronics companies) to offer media content to electronic devices over the internet.Synacor offers a one-stop-shop for monetizing digital content over the internet on multiple devices, which is difficult and expensive for companies to do this themselves, especially smaller ones. What Synacor does is offering a hosted and managed solution that is near free, making most money on search and ad revenue (79% of revenue in 2011, the rest comes from subscriber based services like TV Everywhere).Possible growthThe company has several trends in its favor:MarketSynacor is a relatively big player with some 25% of the market.According to an Oppenheimer report, Synacor's market opportunity is approximately 70 million unique visitors. That leaves considerable room for growth with the number of unique visitors standing at 18.7 million (Q411). However, this means that the law of large numbers dictate that a slow down in growth should set in at some point not too distant in the future and they will need to address other markets or segments and/or get more revenue out of its existing customer base.They could grow international (they already have presence in Canada) and/or explore new customer segments, like consumer electronics companies. The company is already doing that as well, and has Toshiba as its first customer in this segment. The mobile market is also an interesting opportunity since video is the fastest growing data component for mobile networks and many companies do not have the appropriate resources to offer mobile content.As the company scales up costs are likely to diminish as a percentage of sales so there is room for margin improvement, but addressing new markets and sectors might involve additional cost.RisksConcentration of customer revenue is something of a risk. From the latest 10-Q:Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an increasing part of revenue, it averaged 56% in 2011 and rose to 61% in Q1 2012 [Q211 10Q]. This is because the search queries are the fastest growing category, growing faster than display ads, which grows faster than subscriber based revenues (but they're all growing).Another risk is the possibility that as on-line media consumption becomes ever more mainstream (so far as it isn't already), more companies will chose to keep it in-house.Q1 2012The first quarter of this year was a very good one:The latter deserves some explanation as currently there are 16.6M shares outstanding so the net income would be 7 cents per share on the basis of that. But according to the Q1 2012 Quarterly Filing (p.13), 7.8M shares (conversion of preferred stock) and 2.33M (stock options) count for the dilution.While this year will be good, and growth will likely continue thereafter. Guidance was increased (ever so slightly, by 2%) for 2012 revenues. Full year revenues are expected to be between $123M and $126M.However, the law of large numbers argue for a flattening of this growth, unless they can enter new markets and segments, and/or increase revenues from existing customers.Enter the 'BVSN kings'Jonathan Lebed and the ""National Inflation Association"" (essentially the same) have started for some time to heavily tout the shares of Synacor, in a flurry of daily emails. Lebed and the NIA are of Broadvision fame, the stock they pumped from $8 to $50+ (it's now almost back to where it started, at $11).It was truly remarkable how they managed to six-fold BroadVision (NASDAQ:BVSN) on hype alone, considering that company had declining sales for a decade, was losing money and has little immediate prospects (if any). We have to congratulate them with SYNC though, as this, unlike BVSN, is a company which has bright prospects.What both companies share is a low float. The SYNC float is just 25% of outstanding shares, so this is an attractive 'pumper' target to manipulate, especially after a hit like BVSN.It is somewhat ironic that while BVSN shares managed to six-fold on the basis of hype alone, SYNC has risen on the daily flurry of emails from Lebed and the NIA, but not anywhere close to triple digit territory while there is a lot of positive to not about SYNC's business development and prospects.We think that the main culprit here is the more sophisticated investor base in SYNC (compared to BVSN). There are several analyst reports on the company (Oppenheimer, Bank of America, Stifel Nicolaus, BMO Capital Markets, Albert Fried, Citigroup, Needham), while analysts had given up on BVSN. This means that the more sophisticated investor base know when to sell, as one can argue that the shares are becoming rather expensive over $10 (although not anywhere near as expensive as BVSN was during the time it was hyped by NIA).What certainly didn't help were three downgrades by analysts (from Stifel Nicolaus, Citigroup and Bank of America), apparently with explicit reference to Lebed:ValuationOppenheimer has a $10 price target, unchanged despite better than expected results in Q1 2012, in which revenues increased by 64% over Q1 2011 and EBITDA increased a whopping 200% and a (slightly, just 2%) raised outlook from management for 2012. The market capitalization of $360M is roughly three times sales.At over $13 per share, the expected 16 cents in profits this year, or the 38 cents expected for next year amount to rather stiff price-earnings ratios of 84 and 35, respectively. Even the most optimistic analyst expects just 43 cents for next year, which would still amount to a p/e of 31.ConclusionUnlike BroadVision, Synacor is a real promising company. It is well positioned, profitable, fast growing, and has several good growth opportunities in front of it. It has no debt either. However, much of the growth of the coming one or two years is already priced into the shares at $13, so we think the shares are expensive at the moment. Rather than an outright buy we think it offers an interesting trading opportunity between $9 and $13-14.One might also want to keep in mind that the promotional efforts of Lebed and the NIA have been going on for some time, while we don't expect anywhere near the downdraft that happened to BroadVision when these efforts stopped, some retreat is to be expected when that happens.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in SYNC over the next 72 hours."
330222,22762,2012-01-31T18:25:02-05:00,,"By Josh ConstineOnline content, portal and front-end technology solution Synacor filed its amended S-1 today for an IPO looking to raise $75 million. The filing revealed that this month Synacor acquired Carbyn, an HTML5 operating system that lets users put their files, applications and more in the cloud and access them from any device’s browser. It paid $1.1 million in total for the company, with $600,000 paid up front with $500,000 to be delivered in April 2013, and it hired 7 Carbyn employees.The companies are a great fit, a veritable match made in the cloud. Synacor helps telecom and cable service providers set up websites on its managed, hosted platform where their customers can access ”e-mail, security, online games, music and authentication of TV Everywhere.” That means Synacor already handles all your web-based, and TV services, but is missing what lives on your OS. Carbyn’s OS, that can be accessed from anywhere, will fill this gap and let Synacor’s clients provide their customers with an expansive set of services in a single-sign on package.Major stockholders of Synacor, which will each be selling about a quarter of their shares, include Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Walden International, Crystal Internet Ventures, Advantage Capital Partners, and North Atlantic Capital. These companies all contributed to Synacor’s $17 million Series C round in 2006. Some additional facts from the filing include:As mobile demand for access to television and OS-based content increases, Carbyn should become an increasingly valuable component of Synacor. The Ontario-based Carbyn started just a year ago, and the founders said it was looking for its first funding when it made waves in September when it launched at TechCrunch Disrupt. Seems like Synacor picked up Carbyn’s anywhere OS at just the right time.Original post"
717601,29461,2012-07-12T11:48:56-04:00,,"We are bearish on Synacor Inc. (SYNC) because we believe that much of the recent quarterly revenue and growth has already been priced in. It has a significant dependence on a small number of Telecom carriers that provide a majority of its revenues, and a loss for any one of them will severely damage the company's profitability. Moreover, the stock is trading at high multiples that are not justified by its fundamentals. On the basis of the reasoning above, we believe the stock to be overvalued at these levels.Synacor Inc enables various telecom and electronic companies to deliver online content and services to end consumers across multiple devices. In February of 2012, it sold 6.8 million shares at an IPO price of $5. Since the IPO, the company's stock has gone up by almost 175% and is currently trading at $14.15, off 21% from its high so far. CenturyLink (CTL) is the company's biggest customer.The company derives its revenues from two sources:Search and display advertising generates the majority of revenues (80%) for the company through the customer's websites. An expansion in the customer base for companies like CenturyLink is resulting in further revenue growth for SYNC. The company derives its subscriber based revenue (20%) from the use of its services like email, online games and music. In the quarter ended March 2012, which was also the first quarter since the IPO, the company's total revenues increased by a staggering 64%, driven largely by the growth in search and display advertising revenues. Increased internet usage on its customer's websites and search queries can be identified, as the growth drivers for the company. The company has identified three key metrics against which it judges its performance. All three, which include unique visitors, search queries and advertising impressions, have shown a very impressive quarterly growth. The chart shows the improvement in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter of the same period. A consistent upward trend in revenues is also visible in its annual results, where revenues grew by almost 40% in the financial year ended 2011. Its gross margins have also expanded over the past years, reflecting the strength of its operations. SYNC did well to turn its losses into profits in the last financial year, and its profits are on an upward trend since then. In the quarter ended March, 2012, the company increased its net income to $1.2 million from the previous $0.1 million.Key Growth Drivers:The company has shown growth in both top and bottom line in light of increased customer traffic on its clients' websites, as well as improved internet speeds offered by various telecom carriers.Financial StrengthThe company has a strong balance sheet with not a lot of debt. It doesn't pay any dividends, however, it has healthy cash flows, generally inclining with an exception of the financial year 2010. Its margins are high and gradually expanding YoY. Quarterly earnings growth is impressive, and its earnings are expected to grow by almost 20% over the next five years. It provided an earnings surprise of one cent in the last quarter, when it beat the consensus EPS estimate. For the next year, the company is expected to grow its revenues by almost 25%.Key RisksSo far the company doesn't have a mobile software. With an increasing number of consumers now using smartphones and other wireless products, the company's largest revenue source from search and display advertising could be adversely impacted.The company is in the process of growing its business, and is therefore incurring expenses that are expected to increase in the future. SYNC's cost of sales rose significantly by almost 70% in 1Q2012 due to expenses related to licensing of content, as well as marketing of new products. Its revenue sharing agreements with Google (GOOG) are also adding on to its cost of sales. If the company's expenses in regards to marketing as well licensing keep piling up, the company could post losses like it has in the previous years (net loss of $3.6 million in FY2010).The company has a small customer base from which it derives its revenues. In the first quarter of the year, Charter, CenturyLink, Toshiba and Verizon (VZ) provided majority of its revenues. In case of decreased traffic for the above mentioned companies, the company's profitability might be severely impacted.ValuationAccording to a forward P/E multiple of 37x, SYNC is trading at a 200% premium to Digital River Inc. (DRIV-OLD) and a 300% premium to Web.com group Inc (WWWW). The company's quarterly results were impressive in terms of revenue and earnings growth, however, we believe that much of this growth has already been priced in. The company has a trailing P/E of 34x, at a 79% premium to its industry. At such multiples, we believe the stock to be overvalued.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

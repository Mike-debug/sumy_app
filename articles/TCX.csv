4262890,86786,2019-05-11T02:04:19-04:00,"Tucows's recent earnings report paints a picture of negative growth.Increasing operating expenses, penalties, and capital to cash flow are among the negative fundamental factors for this company.I don't think the recent earnings report is mere bad luck, but one sign of an underperforming company.","Last month, in our earnings newsletter, I covered Tucows (TCX) when it was trading at $89 per share. The stock is down 25% after earnings. Luckily, we went with a short trade for earnings, which clearly paid off for those who entered:I like to follow up on these trades because we typically see two time-sensitive prediction factors after earnings: a post-earnings gap and management sentiment change. While the gap in the chart is clearly a breakaway gap and thus not much interest for us gap traders, the change in sentiment could give us hints to where TCX will go over the next quarter. Let's run a financial lexical analysis on the earnings call to see how sentiment changed this quarter.The first thing I noticed when I began running my analysis is that the text of the earnings call is much lower than average. I ran through previous calls to find the drop-off in text exactly one year ago. It seems that since Q2 2018, TCX's management simply ceased fielding questions during the earnings call and instead directed investors to e-mail questions to them.This is not a good sign. Generally, this is done to manage investor expectations and downplay problems. One would expect that sentiment was low when TCX was fielding questions and now higher, but this is not the case.In fact, year over year, we see a 27% drop in sentiment. That is, even with the upward bias gained by removing investor questions - many of which tend to be requests to address concerns, thereby dragging down lexical analysis scores - TCX is showing lower amounts of optimism in its sentiment. Since dropping the question-and-answer section, TCX has not shown any significant quarter-to-quarter changes in sentiment; the pre-recorded earnings calls are well-managed and present market-average sentiment scores.In short, without investor questions, these earnings calls are not much use quarter to quarter. I would say that we should assume TCX management is more pessimistic than the average company's management because of the lack of giving immediate transparency after earnings. This is hard to argue with in light of the recent earnings report, which was objectively bad yet bundled with a pre-recorded earnings call that gave a sentiment score slightly higher than last quarter's - clearly we cannot trust the sentiment scores from these pre-recorded calls.Still, my algorithm was able to flag some statements that showed negative sentiment. It would, nonetheless, be impossible to discuss TCX's recent quarter without some negativity, though management did seem to try. I gather after reading through the entire earnings call, noticing much downplaying of negative factors. Here are a few flagged statements:""In our retail domains channel, we had total registrations in Q1 of approximately 420,000 versus 460,000 in the same period the prior year, with the decline coming primarily from the Enom brands.""- Nearly 10% negative growth in retail domains.""In our Portfolio business, the first quarter saw gross margin of about $150,000, versus $700,000 for the same period last year.""- Nearly 80% negative growth in portfolios. Management claims this segment is not important, is being downsized, and is volatile. It also admits ""some underperformance,"" without specifying the amount of negative growth that came from underperformance versus other factors.""In the short-term category, we experienced our worst quarter of carrier penalties ever at Ting Mobile. By far.""- These penalties amounted to over $1M. This is probably of interest to many investors, but because it is related to TCX's carrier partners, investors can expect to remain in the dark, as ""we have talked too much for my taste recently about our carrier relationships.""""We did feel the impact of winter in our mountain markets in Q1, slowing down both construction and customer installs. We are now delivering on that pent-up demand, and installs in particular are catching up in Q2.""- Management mentions snow and ice - factors outside its control - for Q1 declines. Placing blame outside the company is generally not good for future stock price performance. However, TCX states that it will be better prepared next winter and will see some of the lagged installs from Q1 trickle in Q2. Yet, we do not know the proportion of customers who are waiting for TCX to make installations in Q2 versus those who simply chose another provider.""We get a fair shot at residents moving into new homes, without the encumbrance of existing contracts and early termination fees with other providers. We also have found developers to be enthusiastic marketing partners since crazy fast fiber Internet adds appeal to their properties, and the Ting brand has developed a stellar reputation in its existing footprints. Some of our markets - the Raleigh area and Charlottesville in particular - are seeing strong pipelines of new housing developments, which will drive organic serviceable address growth in these markets for years to come.""- An objectively optimistic statement, this focus on new neighborhoods gives TCX a lower barrier of entry. However, hard numbers for these new housing pipelines are not given.""I want to just take a minute to note that our overall domains gross margin this year will be negatively impacted by our amortizing into revenue, deferred revenue that was recorded at fair value for the March 18th, 2019 Ascio Technologies, Inc. acquisition. The impact of this accounting will lower our overall adjusted EBITDA and gross margin by approximately $3 million.""- This implies that TCX will likely be seeing below-average earnings for the rest of 2019.""Q1 was an interesting quarter in that all the negatives were anomalous short-term impacts amidst a backdrop of positive long term trends.""- This is the summary with which management wants investors to walk away.Even without investor questions, I see enough negative sentiment hidden in this well-managed, pre-recorded earnings call. Many of the statements flagged as optimistic were vague and/or general corporate speak, such as ""We also hope our towns will be surprised and delighted by a service provider like Ting that is energetic, innovative and eager to please."" However, real optimism was also present in statements focusing on areas such as Forex gains and serviceable address growth.Still, fundamentally, TCX has already hit its peak and is thus overvalued. Check out its declining cash flow and earnings:(Source: Simply Wall St)Cash returned on invested capital, too, has been dwindling:(Source: Damon Verial; data from ADVFN)The company's debt situation is also iffy:(Source: Simply Wall St)Though debt has decreased, it is still over 80% of the company's net worth. Moreover, operating expenses are increasing and at a rate much faster than earnings, even if you use a rolling average for the latter metric:(Source: Simply Wall St)The company spent a lot on buyback programs, which has artificially raised the stock price. To get an idea of how overpriced this stock is, check the price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. The former is 55x compared to an industry average of 31x; the latter is 12x compared to an industry average of 4.5x.In short, this company has many problems. The recent earnings report only solidifies this fact. Unfortunately, without the previous transparency investors had via the question-and-answer session in earnings calls, sentiment cannot give us much information in regard to whether this current gap is likely to fill over the coming quarter.I say give TCX another quarter before making any decisions. If management is correct in that this quarter's poor performance was just bad luck, TCX could bounce back. But as I was able to predict TCX's selloff this quarter, I don't think we are looking at bad luck, but a company underperforming."

From a sum-of-the-parts valuation, the fiber segment is a free option investors get at today's price. Elliot Noss has been a wonderful leader for shareholders that has built a domain services business and still growing mobile business. With high reoccurring revenue streams through domain name and email registration services, the business has needed reinvestment opportunities over the years. First was the Ting Mobile business, which provides retail mobile phones and services at a reasonable price. Now we are at the early innings of the fiber internet offerings.Let's take a step back though and analyze a little bit of the back story on the company, to show how strategic and methodical it has been to generate shareholder value. While doing this it should provide us comfort with management controlling shareholder capital.Elliot has been a big believer in large share buybacks at the right price. It's estimated that 50% of the company's outstanding shares were repurchased at 1x 2018 EBITDA. The chart below exemplifies how to implement a share buyback program.TCX data by YCharts2013 was the first year when Ting mobile was launched. It's incredible what management has done with it. Going from a domain name registration and services business to offering mobile services that's generated $83 million in 2017, and is growing at a double-digit clip. Think about that for a minute. In just four years, the company now has a business making 25% of its revenue. Not only that, it generates healthy gross margins at 46%. Let's dive into a little more of the granular economics of Ting mobile.Customer acquisition costs in the past have been noted to be $100. Churn rate has been high, but management has been focusing on this. With churn rates now around 2.5% per month, implies a 3-4 year customer life. Subscriber growth and average revenue per subscriber have both been strong.Exhibit 1: Select Financial DataSource: Company ReportsWith 46% gross profits and ARPU of $487, we can figure out a cash on cash internal rate of return or net present value.Exhibit 2: Economics on CACSource: Author's WorkThe unit economics look attractive as it costs Ting only $100 to get $457 of cash value on their investment or 4x the LTV. The risks are as the subscriber base gets larger, it could become more costly to acquire customers. In addition, churn rates could have a negative effect if Ting mobile sees spikes.The Ting mobile business is growing into a nice business, but scale is needed to become attractive to larger network providers. At 172,000 subscribers, this is just a drop in the bucket, so I don't see a sale of the segment any time soon - that's not to say though, consolidation among the MVNOs might happen more rapidly. Even so, it's a profitable business that is growing nicely that offers excellent customer service, which is a competitive advantage in this space.At 30% EBITDA margins and approximately 10% top line growth, 2018 estimated EBITDA could reach $27 million. At a conservative 10x EBITDA multiple, taking into consideration industry transactions and attractive unit economics, the Mobile business would be worth $270 million. In addition, factoring in a 2% reduction in the shares outstanding, the mobile business would be worth on a per share basis $26. I have to say it's quite remarkable what Mr. Noss has done with Ting Mobile. In just 5-6 years, this segment alone has $270 million of estimated value for a company that was worth $60-70 million 6 years ago.The one risk I don't like about this segment is the rental arrangements for the usage of communication networks. As the subscriber base grows, leverage will come, but for now, Ting Mobile is at the mercy of its network providers.Fiber SegmentTucows got into the fiber internet business in 2014. It has been a slow process but now Ting Fiber is at 16,000 completed serviceable addresses and 85,000 serviceable addresses once the buildout is complete. With 4,500 current customers, penetration is at 28%. Management seeks 50% market penetration and healthy returns.With estimated $2,000-$2,500 cost per serviceable address and gross margins of $900-$1,000 annually, cash on cash returns appear attractive. With very little maintenance requirements once the fiber is in the ground makes this business segment attractive with low churn rates. The biggest risk will be execution risk as lots of capital will be invested over the next few years.To be conservative no value should be given to this business segment as there are too many unknowns. Let's not forget though this segment does have a long runway to become the largest business unit of the company, but to forecast some pie in the sky number 5 years from now would be risky. That's why until any meaningful revenue starts to contribute to the business, I am not willing to value this part. The unit economics look attractive and the segment right now, I consider, is an option for overall business. Just to be clear though, this segment could drive the future of this company along with the mobile business.Domain SegmentThe domain segment is a great business. The company earns fees on the registration of domain names. It's a capital-light business that provides a lot of cash. It's their legacy business that will keep providing cash to scale their Fiber and mobile businesses. With estimated revenue coming in 2018 of $250 million and 15% EBITDA margins, brings in $37.5 million. Using a conservative industry multiple of 10x EBITDA, gives a $375 million value or a per share price with a 2% reduction of $36.Sum-of-the-partsThe business appears to be fairly valued, but investors get the free option of the fiber business. If traction is gained, there is a long path for growth. The subscriber base for Ting mobile is still small and Ting fiber is still at the build-out stage. Customer acquisition will be the next phase as more serviceable addresses come online.The market appears to ignore the optionality of the company. Management is growing three separate business with little synergies. So, a spin-off could be in the making as scale is gained. This would serve as a nice catalyst. In addition, as more towns are announced being under contract for the build-out of fiber could serve as another catalyst. Just recently announced, Fuquay-Varina, NC will be receiving Ting fiber.I wouldn't say these different segments are hidden assets, but by valuing each business unit separately, creates a different view. It's also worth noting two major investors in the company - Union Square a VC firm that has an outstanding track record and a German fund that I have only read investor letters from, but appears to be thoughtful and strategic to portfolio management.To read more research on stock spin-offs, micro-mid cap companies, and special situations please consider following me (by clicking the ""Follow"" button at the top of this article next to my name) to receive notification when I publish research next."

3744466,97406,2015-12-09T11:51:09-05:00,"After attending the ""Fiber for the New Economy"" conference in September, it is clear fiber presents a highly profitable, long-tailed opportunity for Tucows.Subsequent to the conference, the company announced another agreement with Holly Springs, NC.From our discussions with various city officials and conference attendees we believe Tucows is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the opportunity to light up smaller towns and cities.Ting Mobile continues to perform well and management announced new partnerships with Staples and Kroger that will continue to drive growth in 2016 and beyond.The stock remains significantly undervalued at trading at approximately 7.5x next year’s EV/EBITDA and close to 6x 2017 EV/EBITDA.","Fiber Conference TakeawaysAt the ""Fiber for the New Economy"" conference held in Lexington, KY in September we came away with the clear sense that fiber to the home (""FTTH"") presents a massive opportunity given the gross underinvestment by incumbents. Additionally, the inherently local nature of the business with an emphasis on customer service makes Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX) a natural fit to fill the void left by these incumbents. We believe that Tucows' entrance into fiber today will give them a very strong competitive position in the markets they enter whether it be a through a service model or buy and own model. This will add another defensive, recurring revenue stream at what we believe to be very high incremental margins (one CEO at the conference stated that gross margins for the business can approach 95%) to the company's already growing subscription base and expanding margin profile.If Tucows' can execute on their announced and to be announced roll outs over the coming two years, we believe fiber could present $50 to $60 mil in additional revenue to the company, and given our very conservative margin estimates in the 35% to 45% range we believe this could add approx. $15 to $25 mil in EBITDA to this year's EBITDA base of $25 mil. Not including any growth from Ting Mobile, domain, or new Ting offering such as Ting TV, and using a 10x multiple the stock would be worth more than $40 per share for upside of at least 70% from today's price level. And to reiterate, this is only taking into account the fiber opportunity with no contribution from the rest of Tucows' lines of business.Validation of the attractiveness of this opportunity can already be seen in Google Fiber's recent announcement of a roll out to six addition cities (Atlanta, Nashville, Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, San Antonio, and Salt Lake City) after successful deployments in Kansas City, Austin, and Provo. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also announced nine potential locations for fiber roll outs after that, which indicates their commitment to the business. After conversations with many industry participants, which echo sentiments expressed by Tucows' CEO Elliot Noss, we believe the opportunity for Tucows to fill in the smaller cities around Google Fiber in mid-size cities (e.g. Holly Springs, NC outside Raleigh-Durham, NC) is robust.Fiber is an inherently local business because the build out has to be done at a local level and is overseen by the local government unlike broader telecommunications infrastructure which is overseen at the state and federal level. Any Mayor of a city overseeing a fiber build out has more power than the chairman of the FCC. Additionally, fiber roll outs can be done at the neighborhood level so as to best build into demand. The local nature of the business also puts a premium on customer service, which is an area where incumbent cable and internet providers are notorious for their poor performance. Customer service is an area where Tucows already excels in their Ting Mobile business, and they are uniquely positioned to disrupt the incumbents with their superior model.Ting Internet pricing will be around $89 per month for consumer and $139 per month for business with speeds of one gigabit or greater. In the few areas of the country today where incumbents are providing some sort of high speed internet option customers are paying in the around $1200 per month for only a 50 mbps circuit. Keep in mind that this service primarily is still delivered through traditional copper wire so incumbents are essentially charge 5-10x as much for the same circuit. This is clearly monopolistic type pricing and ripe for disruption from a player like Tucows.In the same vein, Tucows has said they will launch a Ting TV product as an add-on to the Ting Internet offering early next year. Ting TV is an opportunity for the 1 gigabyte speed that Ting Internet will provide to really show its value to the customer. As more and more customers cut the cord and move away from traditional cable TV packages and consume more information and entertainment via the internet upload and download speeds will become increasingly important. Ting Internet will be able to offer speeds that simply are not remotely close to achievable on current copper cables used by incumbents to provide broadband access.As will be discussed in more detail, we believe that Ting Internet can replicate the model of Ting Mobile to create tremendous value for shareholders by generating very attractive cash on cash returns.Based on comments from Tucows' management we believe they can roll out to between 4-6 cities per annum in 2016 and 2017. Given the company has already come to agreements with three cities we believe by 2018 the company can be fully rolled out in 10 cities. Thus far the three cities Tucows has reached agreements with are Charlottesville, VA (population 44k), Westminster, MD (population 18.5k), and Holly Spring, NC (population 30k). Assuming an average population of 25k per city this would imply a total addressable population of 250k people, and using the national average of 2.63 persons per household this would result in approx. 95k addressable Multiple Dwelling Units (MDUs) which Ting Internet could reach.At the conference we heard from the local utility in Dalton County, GA which built out a fiber network of their own starting in 1997. They went to their local incumbents and none of them had an interest in funding the build out so they did it themselves. They were expecting 35% penetration 5 years after the initial roll out, and ended up reaching that goal in just 3 years. Today they are at 70% penetration. Since they are a local utility they can respond to an outage within hours, whereas Comcast, CenturyLink, and other incumbents won't respond for at least 24 hours, which again speaks to the local nature of the business. Today the county offer Optilink with speeds above 100 mbps, more than 4x faster than traditional internet speeds provided by the incumbents, for $75 per month.Given the example described above, as well as similar stories we heard at the conference, we believe that Tucows as a private sector company with experience in savvy word of mouth marketing campaigns will be able to achieve take rates of at least 50% by year 3 of the roll out. Under this assumption, by 2018 Tucows would have 47.5k of the 95k MDUs as subscribers paying approx. $100 per month. This represents a potential annual revenue opportunity of $57 mil for the company, which at 40% EBITDA margin would add approximately $23 mil to the EBITDA of the company. With no growth in any of the other businesses, and using a 10x multiple would result in a share price of $45.00 representing 87.5% upside from today's price level.Ting Mobile UpdateTing Mobile continues to perform well as Q3 2015 saw record gross adds, and the company grew its subscriber base to 122k and device count to 192k. Net adds were 9k in the quarter, which is flattish relative to the most recent quarters. We believe this is more reflective of the well-known past customer service disruptions related to Sprint which occurred earlier in H1 2015, and it is not any reflection on future demand for Ting Mobile's service.Aside from this slight tick-up in churn to just under 2.5% from the Sprint disruption, other key metrics remained strong as average customer revenue ticked up to $37 per month and the average cost to acquire a customer remained comfortably below $100. These numbers further underscore the attractive cash on cash returns being generated in the Ting Mobile business.The key metrics underscore Ting Mobile's competitive advantage versus the large carriers. As can be seen in the table below, Ting's savvy grass roots marketing and avoidance of an extensive bricks and mortar presence has resulted in a significant cost advantage for the company in acquiring customers. Yet, as can be seen in the table, Ting's ARPU is not far below that of the other large players, and they achieve this while offering what we believe to be the most transparent and consumer friendly usage based pricing model. This creates a flywheel effect that makes it almost impossible for a competitor to replicate a fully comparable offering, and allows Ting to continue to driver subscriber growth.Of particular note in the company's Q3 2015 earnings call was the announcement of new partnerships with Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) to distribute Ting SIM cards at nearly 2k retail locations across the U.S. We believe this is another savvy marketing technique that should increase the company's mainstream awareness and credibility as a true alternative to the larger carriers. We expect the company to announce additional partnerships and initiatives along these same lines in 2016, which should help solidify the momentum of the Ting Mobile business.Ting Mobile's contribution to the business overall can be seen in both the growth and margins the company reported in the quarter. Ting Mobile's revenue grew 70% YoY in Q3 2015, which helped contribute to overall company revenue growth of 16% YoY, and gross margin expansion of 400 bps from 26% in Q3 2014 to 30% in Q3 2015. This margin expansion can also been seen in the company's record EBITDA of $7 mil achieved in the quarter, which represented growth of 42% YoY.Domain UpdateTucow's legacy domain name business continues to grow as a slow but steady rate, and more importantly continues to generate strong cash flow that can be deployed into both Ting Mobile and Ting Internet. The wholesale domain business grew registrations 2% YoY in Q3 2015 as renewal rates were 79%. Additionally, the average margin per wholesale domain was up 10% YoY as the company shifts the business to higher margin registrants. In the retail channel the company's Hover business continued to perform very well with revenue growth of 17% YoY in Q3 2015.Capital AllocationOn the company's Q3 2015 earnings call, management stated that year to date they have repurchased 637k shares for $14.5 mil or $22.76 per share under their $20 mil buy back authorization. Not only does this indicate management's continued desire to return capital to shareholders, but it also speaks to management's view of the attractiveness of the stock price at just 4% below today's price level. Management's orientation towards shareholder friendly capital allocation also further illustrates management's alignment with shareholders as CEO Elliot Noss holds 600k plus shares which is in excess of 6% of shares outstanding.If one were to conservatively assume the company can convert 60% of EBITDA to free cash flow over the next 3 years, and taking into account management's willingness to gear the balance sheet to 2x net debt to EBITDA, that results in well over $100 mil in cash that can be used for share repurchases. We believe this is another avenue that can provide significant upside to investors as management will have the ability to reduce the share count from 10.7 mil today to under 8.5 mil shares even if the average cost is much higher than today's price level. If our analysis of the Ting Internet and Ting TV business is approximately right then share repurchases even above $30 will be highly accretive to shareholders given the ultimately valuation the company should receive.Valuation and UpsideWe continue to believe Tucows to be materially undervalued based on the organic growth, margin expansion, and defensive business profile characterized by recurring revenue and low churn. On our estimates the stock trades at less than 7.5x 2016 EV/EBITDA and 6 x 2017 EV/EBITDA. If the stock were to be re-rated to where we believe it should trade at a minimum of a 10x multiple that would result in a stock price of $31 on next year's number for upside of greater than 30%.Longer-term, our model suggests that the current business as is, excluding fiber, can achieve $40 mil plus in EBITDA by 2018 taking into account decelerating growth in Ting Mobile as it gets larger. If you add our low end estimate of $15 mil of EBITDA contribution from Ting Internet and use a 10x multiple you would arrive at a stock price of $52.50 per share for upside of 123% from today's price. Even at today's 7.5x multiple, which we believe to be unsustainably low for the aforementioned reasons, you would still arrive at a $42.00 price target for upside of nearly 80%. The juice here is if Ting Internet is able ramp and reach the high end of our EBITDA range, the stock could be worth over $60.00 per share using a 10x multiple representing upside of over 150%.ConclusionWhile the domain and Ting Mobile business continue to generate mid-teens top line growth driving considerable operating leverage for continued 25% EBITDA growth over the coming years, we believe Ting Internet will force the market to revalue Tucows at a significantly higher multiple setting the stage for a large move higher in the stock over the next several years.All we have to do is look at Zayo, Comcast, and Charter's multiples and growth rates. If Ting Internet can achieve the low end of the company's plans the business should be valued at a minimum of 10x given the company's superior growth and customer service.So using a conservative 10x multiple for the company and a conservative 25% growth rate gets you a $31 stock price in 2016 and over a $60 stock price in 2018 for annualized returns of greater than 30% and 150%, respectively, excluding ongoing share repurchases that are likely total $50 mil plus over the next 3 years.Lastly, what gives us confidence in investing in Tucows is the fact that they provide three defensive and necessary services that generate 100% recurring revenue and low churn. When you have great customer service, and you are the low cost provider of a necessary service, your competitive positioning will remain strong regardless of the economic cycle. Everyone loves great service and people become more price conscious in tough times.We believe now is the time for investors to buy Tucows' stock given the attractive valuation and the long term attractiveness of the fiber to the home opportunity. Coupled with continued strong performance from the Ting Mobile business, value creating capital allocation, and future revenue from new businesses such as Ting TV we believe there are numerous avenues which can lead to a win, possibly a very big win, for investors.Please also refer to this article from a former colleague."
3460406,88866,2015-08-23T23:39:48-04:00,"Management recently raised EBITDA guidance 20% from $20 mil to $25 mil for 2015.For an undiscovered microcap the quality and depth of the management team is unmatched, and the company’s top 4-5 executives have been with the company for over a decade.The company added 10,000 subscribers in Q2 despite having a marketing disruption for two months during the quarter. CEO Elliot Noss stated on the company’s Q2 earnings call that:","""In the end, June was our second largest month of gross adds ever following this past December, it brought us back over the 10,000 net add benchmark that we had slipped below briefly with the events of Q1 and hope to stay above in quarters' ahead""IntroductionTucows (NASDAQ: TCX) is an internet and telecommunications company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The company is an ICANN accredited domain name registrar, and is the second largest publicly traded registrar behind GoDaddy (NYSE: GDDY). In February 2012, Tucows entered the mobile phone business when it launched Ting Mobile, an MVNO service operating on the Sprint network. More recently, in December of 2014, Tucows entered the gigabit fiber business with the acquisition of an internet service provider serving Charlottesville, Virginia, and has since engaged with Westminster, Maryland to operate the network put in place there by the local government.Investment ThesisWe believe Tucows is materially undervalued and presents a compelling investment opportunity at 8x forward adjusted EBITDA. Tucows is unique among micro-caps given the company's strong growth, outstanding management team, and superior value proposition. All three of Tucow's business segments have revenue that is 100% recurring. The company focuses on service offerings that are sticky and have inherently low churn. Tucows is also a low cost provider in their markets, which further strengthens their value proposition, while still providing best in class customer service.Tucows' domain name registration business provides significant upfront cash flow that management can use to either return cash to shareholders via share repurchases or re-invest in faster growing, higher margin businesses. Given that the market for mobile devices in the US has over 200 million active users, and today Tucows has only 113,000 active users and 178,000 devices, there is a tremendous runway for growth that will drive leverage in Tucows' model. This leverage should become apparent as Ting Mobile becomes a greater part of the revenue mix with gross margins 10-15% higher than the domain business, and Ting Internet begins to be rolled out in select markets.Augmenting this strong revenue growth is the free cash flow generated by both Ting Mobile and the more mature domain name registration business, which we expect CEO Elliot Noss to continue to allocate judiciously to further enhance shareholder value.Ting MobileTing Mobile was launched in 2012 as a disruptive alternative to the mobile service and data packages offered by traditional carriers such as AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ). While it may seem odd for a domain name registrar to enter the mobile device business, Tucows has strong customer service and back office management that translate well to operating an MVNO. The Ting Mobile model has proven disruptive on three fronts. Firstly, with transparent, usage based pricing and no long term contracts Ting Mobile provides a much better value proposition to customers than fixed rate, long term contracts offered by large carriers. Validation of this contract offering can be seen in recent years as large carriers have begun to migrate towards Ting's model. Secondly, Ting Mobile has established a low cost position by marketing through word of mouth, social media, and consumer reports versus traditional carriers who spend millions of dollars on TV advertising, etc. Thirdly, Ting has no bricks and mortar locations which is replaced by industry leading customer service available over the phone and online.As a result of the disruptive model described above Ting Mobile's cost to acquire a customer is less than $100 whereas larger carrier's costs to acquire are generally well in excess of $300. The average Ting subscriber pays around $35 per month, which makes the lifetime value of a customer in excess of $1,000. We believe these are highly attractive economics for Tucows, and is emblematic of a disruptive model that is a win for both the company and customers, which is evident in the rapid subscriber growth shown in the graph below:In just under 3 years Ting Mobile has managed to grow subscribers at a 128% CAGR and devices at a 124% CAGR. Ting has a very loyal group of core subscribers that on average have approximately 1.6 devices on Ting Mobile. These core subscribers help grow Ting Mobile via word of mouth and also through online consumer reviews.We think Ting can continue to add subscribers at 10,000 plus per quarter net of churn for the foreseeable future. Churn at Ting Mobile has held stable at between 2-2.5%, which is consistent with other players in the industry when taking into account that there are no long term contracts at Ting Mobile. In addition to the attractive pricing and contract terms discussed above, Ting now offers service on a GSM network, which allows the vast majority of mobile devices, including the iPhone 6, to be brought over and used with Ting. This allows Ting to be used on almost any mobile device available in the marketplace, which is up from a just small fraction of devices that could have been used previously.As Ting Mobile continues to add subscribers and grow revenues it also brings up the profitability of Tucows as a whole. Gross margins for Ting Mobile are in the 45-50% range vs. 28-30% for the domain business. If you back into sales and marketing expenses for Ting Mobile by multiplying net adds by the cost to acquire a customer you would arrive at an EBITDA contribution margin for Ting Mobile of approximately 35-40%.Domain BusinessTucows legacy business is domain name registration. This segment remains Tucows' largest today accounting for approximately 60% of revenue although decreasing as Ting Mobile continues to grow and make up a larger and larger part of the overall revenue mix. Although the larger wholesale business is largely mature and slower growing, it continues to kick off significant cash flow. Furthermore, there are currently a number of drivers that should reaccelerate growth within the domain services segment. Firstly, Hover, which is Tucow's retail domain business, has been growing rapidly in recent years and should continue to do so as it delivers industry leading service quality with easy domain transfers and no random charges. Secondly, in recent years a number of new gTLDs (Generic Top Level Domains such as .investments or .medicine) have arisen which present an opportunity for Tucows and other players to register additional domain names as existing corporations and individuals look to register names that are closely related to the names they currently have registered.Ting InternetIn December 2014, Tucows announced the acquisition of Blue Ridge Internetworks (BRI), which is a fixed line internet service provider (NYSE:ISP) providing high speed internet service to three thousand residents in Charlottesville, VA on 35 miles of fiber. On the Q4 2014 earnings call held subsequent to the acquisition announcement, Tucows' management commented on the attractive cash on cash returns they see in the gigabit internet space. Based on management's comments we believe the cash on cash returns being targeted to be in excess of 20% unlevered, pretax IRRs. Tucows' feels this is an attractive extension of the current Ting Mobile model as they can offer prices much lower than existing ISPs (e.g. Comcast NASDAQ: CMCSA) while at the same time leveraging the company's outstanding customer service and back office functionality in an industry plagued by poor customer service. Today gigabit internet is rarely offered, and when it is it can be at price points as high as $300 per month. Ting Internet plans to offer service for approximately $100 per month with transparent pricing and contract options.The BRI acquisition and a subsequent contract win in Westminster, Maryland are not intended to be huge revenue generators for the firm, but rather are intended to serve as test markets for understanding what models works best in the fiber to the home business prior to entering the business in scale. There are three potential business models Ting Internet could pursue: partnering with municipalities, partnering with smaller network companies, and making outright acquisitions. These models come with varying degrees of capital intensity, but offer attractive cash on cash returns across the board. Ultimately, we believe Ting Internet may play out in similar fashion to Ting Mobile as the segment's contribution in the early stages was small, but over time it grew to be highly accretive.By 2018 we estimate, conservatively, Ting Internet will be rolled out in 15-20 cities. If these cities are somewhere between Charlottesville (44k) and Westminster (18k) in terms of population that would results in an addressable subscriber base of approximately 550k people. Following the historical pattern of fiber roll outs where penetration in year one is around 15% and grows to 50% by year three, and pricing the service at approximately $100 per month, excluding any contribution from a future Ting TV offering, on 50% gross margins and low churn we believe this represents an incremental $10 to $15 mil in EBITDA for Tucows.Capital AllocationElliot Noss became the CEO of Tucows in 2001. Since taking the reins at Tucows Noss has not only been a strong operational leader spearheading the company's entry into mobile and more recently into fiber, but he has also been an astute allocator of capital. The high recurring revenue and capital light nature of Tucows' businesses results in strong free cash flow generation, which Noss has used judiciously to both buyback the company's stock when undervalued as well as make organic investments where he sees strong cash on cash returns.Noss has completed eight Dutch Tender offers since the beginning of 2007, and has, at times, simultaneously been in the market with various buyback authorizations from the board. As can be seen in the chart below, since initiating Tucows first buyback program in 2007 the company has repurchased over half of the shares outstanding. As one of the largest shareholders of the company with a stake in excess of 6% Noss' interest are firmly aligned with shareholders.You may have noticed CEO Noss sold 50k shares for the first time in years last week in order to purchase a house. We have little concern over this sale given it represents under 8% of his holdings which are worth over $16 mil today. We believe that insiders will continue to hold onto their shares for years to come and that management and the board will continue to aggressively repurchase shares in the open market at today's prices given the discounted valuation.Given Tucows' strong cash flow generation and net cash position on its balance sheet we believe there is capacity for debt up to 2x EBITDA, or approximately $50 mil, which could be used for either share repurchases or organic investments in fiber.ValuationTucows is currently on pace to grow EBITDA in 2015 in excess of 60% in 2015. As we look out to future years, as with all companies, we anticipate this growth will moderate to some degree, but Tucows should still be able to generate a minimum of 30% growth in EBITDA for the next several years for a few key reasons. Most importantly, the domain registration business will continue to shrink as a percentage of the mix while Ting Mobile and Ting Internet, which both have gross margins that are more than 50% higher, will continue to grow at rapid rates. Ting Mobile and Ting Internet are still just beginning to penetrate very large markets where they have a cost and service advantage. Additionally, as a result of the company's growth rate and accelerating margin profile, the stock will trade at a higher multiple. Lastly, we expect management to continue to aggressively buyback stock, which will also be accretive.If we assume, conservatively, that Tucows growth rate is cut in half in 2016, the company would still do approximately $3.15 per share in EBITDA not taking into account any accretion from future share buybacks. On these numbers the stock trades at less than 8x EV/EBITDA, which for a company with increasing profitability and a long runway for growth we see as being materially undervalued. If the stock were to trade in line with other companies exhibiting similar growth trajectories as Tucows we believe the stock should receive at least an 11x multiple, if not 12-13x multiple. Under these assumptions the stock would be worth somewhere between $33 and $41, again, excluding any share repurchases.Further upside potential exists in 2017 and 2018 as investments in fiber made over the course of 2015 and 2016 begin to bear fruit and be accretive to EBITDA similar to the path Ting Mobile has taken over the past few years. Using the EBITDA contribution from Ting Internet discussed previously, and conservative growth for Ting Mobile, it is reasonable Tucows could be generating in excess of $65 mil in EBITDA under which scenario the stock would be worth in excess of $70, which would represent upside of 180% in just three years.We also expect the company to get further sell side coverage in 2015 and 2016, which will likely increase ownership and the multiple. Longer term, as the company gets larger, we would expect multiple larger strategic companies would be very interested in acquiring Tucows for their customer service capabilities and skilled management.RisksPrimary risks to the investment thesis include subscriber growth at Ting Mobile slowing more than forecast due to competition or other factors, and any events that would lead to the departure of CEO Elliot Noss. We see a number of mitigating factors to both of these risks including the fact that there has been little management turnover given the strong results and entrepreneurial culture.ConclusionTucows is a defensive growth company with recurring revenue, strong free cash flow generation, and increasing profitability with an excellent management team and board of directors that exhibits strong corporate governance. The CEO is aligned with investors and continues to own 6.5% plus of the company. At today's price levels we believe the stock provides a compelling investment opportunity to long term investors who want to be a part of a disruptive company run by an outstanding management team."
2823076,80496,2015-01-15T10:05:01-05:00,"Uncertainty exists regarding how much Ting will grow in 2015 and beyond. Specifically, can it continue to perform well in the highly competitive MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) sector?Ting’s superior performance on social media (Facebook and Twitter) relative to other MVNOs may be a useful indicator of upcoming growth and the maintenance of low churn rates.Ting subscriber growth of 14,000-16,000 per quarter, instead of the 11,000-13,000 that has occurred over the past six quarters, would further enhance TCX’s value at current prices.","Tucows: A Brief OverviewFor those unfamiliar with Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX), there are several excellent analyses that have already been offered (see here and here) that outline the business, financials, and growth prospects of the company. Briefly, Tucows has two main revenue streams: 1) domain services and 2) Ting - an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) that provides wireless services within the United States. Currently, the domain services business (as a whole) is stable and exhibits little or no growth, while Ting has grown rapidly since its inception in 2012. As highlighted by others (see here), Ting will be the company's primary source of income by the end of 2015. While 2015 is almost certain to be an excellent year for Ting, uncertainty remains regarding how much growth will occur in 2015 and beyond.Two primary risks have frequently been mentioned when discussing the future prospects of Ting: 1) In the competitive sector of MVNOs, how will Ting manage to maintain growth and retain subscribers? 2) How much of a limiting factor is their use of the Sprint network? The company has already addressed the latter by signing an agreement to provide cellular services on a GSM network (see this news release). In my opinion, the magnitude of this deal should not be understated. This opens up the potential for AT&T (NYSE:T) and T-mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) customers (among others) to move their lines over to Ting and dissipates concerns over Sprint's coverage. While the company has basically shown 11,000 to 13,000 subscriber ads for the last six quarters this could, in and of itself, substantially accelerate that number.While I believe that the GSM deal is likely to accelerate growth in 2015, should we be optimistic regarding Ting's competitive advantage in the MVNO sector? First, I think that many have underestimated the general populace's awareness of Ting. Potential customers still appear to be unaware that the company exists. One could argue that management could do more promotion, but such a strategy seems unwarranted given their success to date. Ting prides itself on excellent customer service, which is a trait that is often lacking in the cellular provider industry. Indeed, Ting recently received the highest consumer rating amongst its peers, which likely brought it to the attention of many potential customers. This exposure, coupled with Ting's strong reputation among its existing customers, highlight that the company's enviable position as an MVNO.These warm and fuzzy conjectures make me feel more comfortable with my investment in TCX, but is there quantitative evidence to suggest that these accomplishments have manifested themselves in the form of growth? While upcoming quarterly financials are a foolproof test of whether Ting's competitive advantage is material, I would like to share with you an alternative measure, via social media, that I have been tracking over the last six months, which may give us a glimpse of what we can expect going forward. Alternatively, this analysis may be bunk and I will embrace it as a failure.My initial thought process went something like this: Growth on social media for Ting, in the form Facebook likes and Twitter followers, may be correlated with Ting's growth and footprint. For this reason, I have tracked Ting's social media growth against two of its primary peers, FreedomPop and Republic Wireless. I initially anticipated this to be a very casual endeavor, so that explains the limited number of MVNOs that I collected data for. I plan on adding a more MVNOs and will monitor a wider base going forward. With that said, I still argue that FreedomPop and Republic Wireless are useful and relevant comparisons.How does Ting's social media presence and growth compare to its peers?On Facebook, Ting has more likes than FreedomPop, but less than Republic. In contrast, Ting possesses the highest following on Twitter (18100). What's more interesting than these gross numbers is the percent change quarter over quarter:Here you can clearly see Ting's strength in the social media realm. It is my personal opinion that this strength will soon manifest itself in the form of additional subscriber growth.Could my analysis using social media be completely wrong? Absolutely. However, at the very least, this analysis demonstrates that Ting appeals to a younger/tech-savvy demographic, people are very happy with the product, and Ting's churn rate is likely to remain low. Furthermore, it illustrates that the company is proactive on social media, which is a low-cost and modern form of advertising. This is encouraging considering that innovation within a sector typically comes from early adoption amongst younger demographics. The wireless service provider industry is also currently undergoing rapid change, which is not dissimilar from what occurred in Europe over the last several of years with companies like Free gaining massive market share due unique pricing and consumer popularity. If this analysis proves useful in the upcoming quarters, then I will attempt to correlate social media growth with subscriber growth.Implications for bottom line growthIn conclusion, if the GSM deal and Ting's competitive advantage can lead to 2,000 or 3,000 extra subscribers per month starting in Q2 2015, then bottom line growth will be more like this analysis of Ting than this more conservative estimate. Even the author of the aforementioned conservative scenario notes that TCX's share price does not reflect upcoming growth in 2015."

2776485,79205,2014-12-23T12:43:01-05:00,"Recent 10-Q reports and management calls allow us to quantify the trajectory and economics of Ting's growth. Ting will drive company EBITDA from $8m in 2013 to $19m in 2015.Ting's growth is extremely profitable: it requires only S&M investments which deliver 165% IRR.The rest of Tucows business in terms of revenue and gross margin is growing (retail) due to top product offering and new gTLDs.2014 10-K is the catalyst: 2014 is the first year when Ting is noticeably contributing to EBITDA. Ting's potential is under the radar for most investors.Market EV/EBITDA LTM = 20.1х, EV/EBITDA 2015F = 8.1х.","Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX) is a rapidly growing company thanks to the Ting segment. 2014 will be the first year in which Ting shows up in annual EBITDA. For now, its growth is hidden.In this article, I quantify the economics and trajectory of Ting's growth and value Tucows based on DCF. The article is succinct and assumes that the reader is familiar with the basic facts of the company.Ting: RevenueTing is a MVNO service in the U.S on top of the Sprint network. It was introduced to the market at the beginning of 2012 and has shown noticeable progress since then. It may sound strange for an internet domain company to go to mobile, but I see clear reasons for this: Tucows was always strong in customer service and back office service management systems, both of which are key factors of a successful MVNO.Note: Ting adjusted the way they count customers in Q3 2014; Q3 2014 QoQ growth is calculated before the changeOn average, there are 1.57 devices per customer.Ting represents 0.15% of Sprint's 54.3m customers (end of 2014 Q2) so it has plenty of room to grow unnoticed.Based on the latest earnings calls it is now possible to explore the economics of Ting's growth:These numbers lead to an average after-tax IRR of 165%. Taking into account that Ting's customers have no contracts, announced churn is in-line with industry rates.Postpaid churn rates for the four major US operatorsSourceThe number one question in valuing Tucows is to forecast Ting's growth trajectory. Will the growth accelerate or slow down? What is the most relevant driver of growth: net customer adds or % growth? There are no indications from management about that, but they have indicated in their Q3 call that they plan to accelerate Ting's growth:This claim is well supported by Ting's enormous return on capital.At the same time, there was enough data from the recent quarters to give us a hint about the trend. For the last four quarters the growth rate was stable in terms of the number of net adds: 11,000-13,000 per quarter. According to Q3 management call, the slow down in Q3 was caused by the following localized reasons:Elliot Noss (NYSE:CEO) states, ""Looking ahead, we believe each of these areas, device, network and price bring more opportunities for Ting growth than threats."" So for the base case I assume:Ting: EBITDA contributionTing has two lines of expenses (before overhead expenses such as G&A and Technical operations and development):Assuming that S&M are proportional to gross adds, I managed to split Ting S&M expenses out of total. In the forecast it's assumed that each customer costs $95 to acquire and churn is 2.25%.An important point is that 2014 will be the first year when Ting provides noticeable EBITDA contribution to Tucows overall EBITDA:Domain BusinessTucows' ""traditional"" business is the domain business. Some definitions are below for clarification.Domain zonesHierarchy of domain registration industryIn recent years, the major trend in the domain business has been the appearance of a lot of new gTLDs (like "".investments"") which are sold for much higher prices (for example, see the prices here). New gTLDs are allowing higher margins for all the players in the value chain and are expected to drive growth in the overall number of registrations. Owners of different brands and domain names would be motivated to occupy their names in new relevant gTLDs.Tucows reported that its joint venture with Radix and NameCheap won the auction to operate the online registry. Each partner is expected to contribute $4-5m to cover the cost of the auction. Management expects this zone to become one of the most popular among gTLDs. As it's currently hard to estimate the return, this JV is not factored into the model (I'm assuming it would be positive due to the reasons above).At the moment, Domain services is the biggest segment of Tucows. Here, Tucows acts as an accredited registrar for resellers offering over 200 TLDs. For example, for TLDs managed by ICANN it is one of 1160 accredited registrars.Tucows is the 3d biggest registrar worldwide and the biggest publicly traded registrar.Source: GoDaddy S1 June 9, 2014, dreamhost.com, VerySign Domain Name Industry Brief Q4 2013, Tucows 2013 10-KTucows charges resellers for new domain registrations, renewals and transfers - per domain.Value added services consist of hosted email, SSL, other trust certificates and other services.Revenue of Wholesale Domain Services (=Domain Services + VAS) stabilized since 2013 with some fluctuations, so I forecast growth for the future based on the trend in Q1-Q3 2014.Gross margin of wholesale domain services showed an increase in Q2-Q3 2014 due to higher share of ccTLDs and new gTLDs. Management expects this trend to continue which is reflected in my forecast with some gross margin increase.Retail is retail domain sales provided through hover.com website. Hover is perceived as one the best providers of domain registration services where service quality is concerned (this can be seen in many reviews by searching for ""best domain name registrars""). While at first glance domain registration looks like a commoditized business, there are several dimensions which separate good providers from others:This service is very cheap (~$14/year/domain) but sticky: to transfer a domain from one registrar to another is a complex process. Many domain owners don't bother doing this to save $1/year/domain.June 23, 2014 Google announced that it's entering domain registration. Supposedly, this was a catalyst in Tucows stock drop. My view is that the impact of Google as a new competitor will be limited: due to stickiness of the service owners of existing domains will hardly move to Google and will continue to register new domains at their current registrar. So the only easily reachable segment for Google is new registrations by new webmasters. As the business is not very profitable, a large marketing campaign is not justified.Retail showed 23% growth in 2013 and 26% in 9m 2014 due to the factors described above and growth of registrations in new gTLDs (to 21% in Q3 from 10% in Q2 and 7% in Q1 2014). I forecast some slow down in the growth rate to 20% in 2015 and 15% in 2016-19.Gross margins decreased 2.6% in 9m Q2 2014. Higher margins from new gTLDs were offset by continuing engagement in promotional campaigns and somewhat more aggressive pricing, so I forecast it to stay at 2014 levels.Portfolio is a business of owning domain names and displaying adds to random visitors. It has some volatility due to periodic sales of domain portfolios, investments to applications for new gTLDs and volatility of advertising revenues. This segment provides only 6% of total revenue and I forecast it based on existing trends.Below is a summary of revenue growth and gross margin forecasts for Domain Services businesses.Revenue growth: Domain servicesGross margin: Domain servicesExpensesThe company has three ""regular"" expense lines between ""gross margin except D&A"" and EBITDA:Also there are ""Network, other costs"" in COGS which behave more like fixed costs.The approach to Ting S&M forecast was described above. Other S&M is forecasted proportionally to revenue.Technical operations and development and G&A declined as a % of revenue at least in 2011-13.I forecast a continued decline as a % of revenue for these expenses in 2014 and then this ratio will stay constant. This is quite a conservative approach as history proved that a considerable share of these expenses are fixed. At the same time, as Ting's business is not that big, there are not enough growth statistics to decouple fixed components from variable. It should be possible to do this based on at least 2014 10-K.""Network, other costs"" are forecasted to decline on an absolute basis assuming continued optimization.Acquisition of BRIOn December 16, 2014 Ting announced the acquisition of a 70% stake in Blue Ridge InternetWorks (BRI) - a fixed line internet provider in Charlottesville, Virginia (44k population). The CEO hadn't disclosed any financial numbers on the conference call, but he did provide the following:BRI 2015 revenue may be up to 3k*$100*12=$3.6m which is not significant for Ting so BRI was not factored in my model. At the same time, the CEO's bet on the gigabit internet industry looks reasonable and could offer a way for growth and value creation when Ting's growth slows down.ManagementMr. Noss, 51, started to work for one of the companies which later formed Tucows in a merger in April 1997 - Tucows Interactive Ltd. - and became CEO of Tucows in August 2001. So, he has been in the domain registration business from pre dot-com bubble period and in the company since its formation. He has proven he can grow revenue steadily over many years without a single interruption while at the same time deliver consistently attractive ROE.Tucows' management shows long lasting commitment through stock ownership: key managers own a noticeable amount of shares and more importantly, they've increased their positions since 2005.Whatever change takes place in domain industry, Tucows with its niche position and experienced CEO, is well poised to protect itself and grow shareholder value in the process.ValuationBelow is a print-out of Tucows DCF model for the base case described above based on 2014 Q3 numbers.UpsideRisksScenarios & SensitivitySensitivity analysis for key risk drivers shows that:ConclusionOn December 12, Ting announced its next share buyback program through a Dutch Auction with $8m limit and expected price range in $16.5-18.5 per share, again indicating the management's position that the stock is underappreciated.Taking Ting net customer growth as the key driver and assuming 50-150k customers range for 2015-17, we derive a target price of $20-29. It could be achieved in 1-1.5 years time when Ting's growth economics and trajectory are discussed in financial reports.If Dutch auction is factored in the model, in gives +$0.3-0.4/share depending on the acquisition price."

(NASDAQ:TCX) announced in a press release to acquire wholesale domain name registrar eNom from the Rightside Group for $83.5 million.""Tucows will pay $83.5 million, and the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings."" Said the press release.We also learned that the acquisition of eNom will be funded through an amendment increasing Tucows Inc.'s existing credit facility to a total of $140 million.Furthermore, the press release noted that the acquisition of eNom ""will add 14.5 million domains under management and 28,000 active resellers."" As a result, Tucows will have a total network of over 40,000 resellers globally and 29 million domains under management, making them the second largest domain registrar in the world.Figure 1: Since Announcing the Acquisition of eNom, Tucows Inc.'s Stock Price Went Up by Around 35%Since the acquisition was announced, Tucows Inc.'s stock price has gone up from $36.25 per share, and currently trading at $48.95 per share, which represents a 35.0% increase in price.Takeaway from Recent Financial PerformanceFigure 2: Over the Last 5-Year Period, Tucows Inc.'s Quarterly Revenue Increased by 78.17%Over the last 5-year period, Tucows Inc. has gradually increased its quarterly revenues. In Q3 2016, Tucows Inc. managed to post a $49.06 million revenue, which represents a 78.17% increase over the last five years.Domain & hosting business operates in a small margin industry due to the homogeneous nature of the key products. However, by taking some stiff cost cutting measures since the start of 2015, Tucows Inc. management was able to increase their net income to match their growing revenues. In fact, their net income increased by 185.0% during the last five years. Hence, their bottom line growth was double the rate of their top line growth.During the Q3 2016 earnings call, the CEO of Tucows Inc., Elliot Noss, mentioned that ""third quarter again saw record performances across each of our key financial metrics. Such as ""net income and adjusted EBITDA were up 50% and 48% respectively, as a result of the significant operating leverage in our business,"" he noted.Figure 3: Tucows Inc. Stock Price Has Gone Up by 1100% In the Last Five YearsBecause of the continuous improvement in both top and bottom lines of the company, investors were already bullish. Even before the acquisition of eNom was announced, Tucows Inc.'s stock price was in a strong uptrend, where the stock price increased from only $2.5 per share at the start of 2012 to over $36 per share.As a result, the eNom acquisition attracted additional bullish momentum in the market, which helped propel the stock to over $48 per share in the last few days.Domain and web hosting industry was once a growth industry, where investors were ready to wait to get any profits back. However, the whole industry is maturing and saturating. However, Tucows Inc. managed to deliver both top line growth and increased their gross profit margin over the last two years, and investors rewarded the company by bidding up the stock price.With the consolidated business of Tucows Inc. and eNom, we believe that Tucows Inc. management would be able to further increase profitability because of added economies of scale.ConclusionOn January 23, 2017, CapitalCube published an analysis confirming that Tucows Inc. has ""strong fundamentals."" ""The company's year-on-year change in revenues and earnings are better than the median among its peer group,"" they noted.As we mentioned earlier, Tucows Inc. operates in a very homogeneous industry, and CapitalCube mentioned that their pre-tax margins indicate they have a ""non-differentiated product portfolio. However, they also confirmed that Tucows Inc. was able to implement tighter cost control relative to peers.We believe that the vital difference between the competition and Tucows Inc. is their management, who would be able to apply the same streamlined approach to the acquired business of eNom. Therefore, we are optimistic that the current uptrend would likely to sustain over the next two to four quarters."
2174493,64043,2014-04-29T17:15:27-04:00,"Profitable, disruptive new business called Ting that should double this year.Steady, legacy business that will accelerate growth due to gTLD rollout.Innovative, top tier management team that is very shareholder friendly.","Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX) operates two separate businesses. The legacy business is as a domain registrar that provides domain name registration and value added-services (primarily e-mail) to resellers and retail customers. The new business, Ting, is a mobile virtual network operator (""MVNO""), or in simpler terms, a wireless phone carrier that uses the Sprint (NYSE:S) network. While these two product lines may not sound particularly interesting at first glance, there is a lot more under the hood that makes this company and stock very interesting.Wholesale DomainThe wholesale domain business has traditionally been the bulk of TCX's revenues and income. TCX acts as a registrar, in which they purchase domain names from the registry (such as the .com registry, owned by Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN)), and then resells it to the public. The public isn't able to purchase from Verisign directly, so they have to go through companies such as TCX, GoDaddy, eNom, etc. TCX is slightly different from its competitors in that it is a wholesaler that sells domain names to other players, who then sell to the public. They generate income off the spread these transactions. TCX also makes a smaller amount of revenues (around 10% of their wholesale revenues) selling value added services, such as hosted e-mail and SSL certificates. While smaller, these value added services generate a much higher margin at around 80%.The wholesale business has traditionally been slow growth and steady, but if you've been following the industry, you will know that ICANN has started to roll out new generic top level-domains (gTLDs) this year. gTLDs are new domain names that use different domains. For example, "".com"", "".net"", and "".org"" are all gTLDs. ICANN is now in the process of approving and implementing over 1,400 new gTLDs over the next two years. The first batch in January were ones such as "".guru"" and "".bicycle."" This is expected to reaccelerate growth in domain name registrations, as people rush out to secure the newest and rarest domain names. Although these will never grow as big as the existing gTLDS, these gTLDs aren't priced at the typical rate of under $10 dollars a year, but closer to the $40-60 (and some at $100+) range. As a result, the industry is expected to reaccelerate as the rollout occurs. The company has publicly stated that new registrations will be in the 3-5% growth range, but with pricing at 4x and above for these new gTLDs, I expect overall revenue growth from this segment to be in the 10-12% range. Furthermore, margins should also expand as the mix shifts.I wanted to note that there may be some confusion about registrar/registry and if TCX is bidding for these new gTLDs. TCX was considering becoming a registry for a few new gTLDs and sent in applications with some other partners. Since the initial process last year, TCX has decided that they are better off just running a registrar business and have withdrawn a majority of their applications. By withdrawing, they also recouped some of the fee that was associated with applications, which reflects their larger portfolio segment in their latest filing. That being said, TCX is still able to have access to all the new gTLDs coming out, selling wholesale to other sellers as they have done before. So while they aren't managing the registry, they are still selling domain names.HoverHover is TCX's retail domain business. Hover sells domain names directly to retail customers. Although there are many competitors in this space, Hover has been able to grow a consistent 20% y/y. Hover's competitive advantage is its customer service - the product doesn't have any exceptionally innovative or differentiated products, but is focused on providing top of the line customer service. As a result, Hover is able to continue to grow through word of mouth and generate minimal sales expense. From my model (and what management has stated), Hover operates at high 50s/low 60s gross margin range. For 2014, I expect another year of 20% growth, along with some margin expansion due to selling gTLDs to retail as well.TingWhile both Hover and Wholesale are steady businesses, the real thesis lies with their newest product - Ting. As mentioned before, Ting is a MVNO that runs off the Sprint network. On the surface, this doesn't sound like a great business. It's dependent on Sprint, there are a ton of MVNOs in the market, and the margins in the industry aren't great. However, after I took a closer look, I realized that Ting is completely opposite of this. But before we get into that, let's look at Ting's business model.Ting operates on a transparent usage plan. The less you use, the less you pay. Each usage metric (voice minutes, texts, and data) are calculated independently. To date, about 98% of people who could potentially use Ting would save money compared to Verizon (NYSE:VZ) or AT&T (NYSE:T). You can try it out for yourself.It's not that Ting is doing anything extraordinarily innovative, but really that Ting sees the sky high margins in the wireless space and is willing to charge less. Ting also doesn't lock people into contracts. A customer pays per month and can come in and out at any time.What's also interesting about Ting is that they allow, and actually encourage, their customers, to bring their device (""BYOD""). Any phone that works on the Sprint network (except for the newest flagship phones), will work on Ting. The company isn't using the subsidy/higher monthly contract model to lure you in. They really just want to get you on their service. In fact, the company might end up losing money selling phones because they have to flash the software and ship the phone to you. If you don't have a phone to buy, Ting has partnered up with a company called Glyde to purchase used phones. Lastly, Ting is all about customer service. The company is consistently praised for their customer service. You can see from their Facebook comments and the Nov 2013 Lifehacker poll. Read the comments - people LOVE Ting. I think it is interesting to note that although Ting finished 2nd in the voting (1,400 votes to Republic Wireless' 1,700 votes), Ting has 16,000 likes on Facebook while Republic Wireless has 95,000 (I use Facebook likes as a metric because I don't have the number of users for Republic Wireless). While this isn't a bulletproof data point, it does imply that either Ting's smaller customer base tends to be socially active and/or they like the product so much they are willing to support it through various forms of media. I can't say I can put a particular value on this, but having a network of users that are social influencers is a great thing. Most of what you read online is negative publicity, so to have such a great user base is a valuable asset for Ting. It also implies a much sticker user base with lower churn (will get to that later) and a lower customer acquisition cost.Ting also wins customers by working with the carriers to provide the best phones and availability. For example, Ting was the first MVNO to offer 4G LTE service and has recently started accepting (and also selling) the iPhone 5, Nexus 5, and soon to be released Galaxy S5.So the company's edge is cheaper, more transparent pricing, flexibility (in their BYOD program), and customer service. How does this translate into a good investment?1. Ting is a rapidly growing business hidden within the larger TCX umbrella.TCX does not break out Ting revenues and exact margins, but I was able to back it out through the last eight earnings calls and financial statements. Ting started organically in Feb 2012. By the end of 2012, the company had 10,000 customers and $4m in revenues. By the end of 2013, Ting had 48,000 customers and $16.5m in revenues. Given the Q4 run rate and growth, I project Ting to reach 100,000 customers and $35m in revenues by the end of 2014. Essentially, you have a company with 100% growth that very few people know about because the company has not disclosed it in the financial statements. Even more importantly, Ting is cash flow positive! This isn't a high flying tech stock with huge sales expenses and no profitability. Ting is accretive to the company and doesn't require an outside source of funding to grow. Which gets me to my second point.2. Ting's gross and operating margins are growing and much higher than the industry.This might sound far-fetched, but at maturity, I estimate Ting's margins to be much better than other MVNOs, even though they charge less. This is partially due to their BYOD program. As it increases from 60% to 67% to 75% (over the past few quarters), Ting gets more and more of their revenues from the monthly service fees and less from equipment sales. Many carriers are trying to sell hardware at a loss to sign up customers, but Ting does not need to do this. In fact, when the Nexus 5 came out (one of their most used phones), Ting offered to sell it, but told its customers to buy it from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) directly at a lower price! If you don't believe me, here is the post. So having a smaller percentage of their revenues coming from transactional equipment sales which can vary quarter to quarter, Ting is building a higher margin stable business. Furthermore, Ting doesn't operate retail stores. This allows Ting to save on store costs and run a lean operation with just their online site and customer service centers. However, this isn't all.3. Ting's customer acquisition cost and churn is much lower than their peers.As I alluded to before, people love Ting. So much, in fact, that in their most recent earnings call, Ting stated that their churn numbers after the first month are similar to Verizon/AT&T. This is incredible because Verizon/AT&T get to that churn number because they lock their customers into contracts. Ting doesn't need to do this, as their customers are incredibly loyal and sticky. In addition, Ting controls its customer acquisition costs by leveraging innovative marketing and word of mouth. You won't see Ting advertisements on television or national media, but instead, the company uses social media and other forms of marketing to get the word out. For example, Ting runs a campus rep program that incentivizes students to sign up other students and earn referral credits. Ting also pays out 25% of early termination fees if you come from another carrier. These simple, yet effective, ways to market help Ting generate a customer acquisition cost of only $80 per customer. These customers also tend to be influencers - as they become happy with the service, they will add on additional phones for their parents, siblings, and partners.Just to clarify, churn is typically calculated after the first month because there is a disproportionate amount of churn in the first month due to people unhappy with the network (I believe this is the same way that Verizon/AT&T calculates churn). Although Ting is new, I expect that the typical Ting user will say around 5 years and generate about $1,500 in revenues and $1,000 in gross margin. At a CAC of $80, this results in over a 10 to 1 payback, with payback occurring within half a year. These metrics are incredible, and the street agrees as well. In the most recent call, the portfolio manager at Fertilemind Capital, a buy-side firm, said:Management agreed, and is now looking to take their CAC from the $80 level to $100-$110 level as they attempt to accelerate growth.4. Ting is still just a tiny piece of the pie.Even at 100,000 customers next year, Ting is still just a small piece of the overall market. Verizon has over 100m subscribers, and the bigger (and now acquired) MVNOs such as Boost and Virgin Mobile are both in excess of 5m. I believe that Ting has a huge runway left to continue to grow 3-5 years out as they continue to take share away from the larger carriers. Let's put it in this context - if Ting has a million subscribers, generates 300m in revenues, and generates 100m in EBITDA, I'm not so sure Verizon even bats an eye. Yet the entire company trades for 140m in market cap currently.5. Ting doesn't have carrier riskFirst, Ting is complementary to Sprint. Over 70% of Ting customers come from a carrier other than Sprint, so they bring in additional revenue to Sprint (my understanding is that Ting pays Sprint for service/bandwidth, so the more Ting makes, the more Sprint makes as well). The remaining amount are actually Sprint customers who leave Sprint due to dissatisfaction and then are scooped back up by Ting. Ting has stated that Sprint actually makes more money if a customer is on Ting compared to their own business, because Ting is so much more efficient around customer acquisition and customer support costs.Back to the overall business. I also wanted to mention that TCX is a Canadian based company, and so far only has Canadian sell-side coverage. As such, I believe that it is under most of Wall Street's radar. If the company is able to pick up U.S. coverage and get the Ting story out to the public, the company could really see a boost in interest and investors. It's interesting to note that Ting actually does not operate in Canada - the Canadian wireless industry is full of collusion which is hampering Ting from ever taking off.Lastly, I want to mention that TCX generates good FCF that should continue to increase as Ting becomes more and more accretive. The company currently yields 5% FCF, and also has a net cash position of $6m, or $0.50/share. Even with the organic rollout of Ting, the company does not spend very much on capex. Furthermore, TCX has recently announced a $20m share buyback program, which at current levels should take approximately 15% of shares outstanding off the table. TCX does not pay a dividend, and is not expected to, as its shareholder base is largely Canadian and subject to detrimental dividend tax rates.ValuationI provide three scenarios for valuing TCX. Hover and the Wholesale Domain tend to be more stable businesses, so my valuation assumptions don't vary wildly. I'm going to assume negative 10% growth for their portfolio segment in all scenarios(I haven't discussed this because it is a very small and declining segment of the business, less than 10% of revenues/margin). For my bear case, I assume that Wholesale only grows at 8%, Hover at 15%, and Ting at 75%. These are all lower than what management has stated or based off my projections. At 4x EBITDA for Wholesale, 6x EBITDA for Hover, and 2x Sales for Ting, I believe the stock is valued at $11 in 2014 and $14 in 2015. If I include share repurchases, these amounts get to $11.75 in 2014 and $16.25 in 2015. I want to state that this bear case is VERY conservative - a growing company with no significant obstacles shouldn't be valued at 4x EV/EBITDA.For my base case, I assume Wholesale grows at 10%, Hover at 20%, and Ting at 100% for 2014. I apply a 5x EV/EBITDA multiple to Wholesale, 8x EV/EBITDA to Hover, and a 3x Sales to Ting. This gets me to $16.50 for 2014 and $23.50 for 2015, without repurchases. With repurchases, I'm closer to $17.50 and $27. As I mentioned before, I see these multiples are realistic once investors take a closer look at the company and understand Ting's economics.For my bull case, I assume Wholesale grows at 15%, Hover at 25%, and Ting at 150%. My 100% growth assumption only assumes that Ting grows at the current net subscriber add that it did in the past. If the company is able to accelerate these net adds (they have done so every period), the sky is really the limit. Using a 6x EV/EBITDA for Wholesale, 10x EV/EBITDA for Hover, and 5x Sales for Ting, the price trades at $28 for 2014 and $48 for 2015. With repurchases, I get closer to $30 and $55, or basically a 4-bagger by 2015.Given the current price at $14.40 at current prices, I believe that TCX provides significant asymmetrical risk/returns. I've looked at this multiple ways, and I'm not sure where TCX can go wrong given its strong positioning, competitive advantages, and industry tailwinds.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

4133323,103922,2017-12-21T15:09:27-05:00,The CEO is the biggest single shareholder.The Network Access Services is growing every year.Legacy business generating recurring cash flow.,"Around four years ago, I heard about Ting through an ad on YouTube. I was curious and fascinated, but I did not take time to do a proper research about it. However, around two years ago, when I started investing, I began to constantly hear about Ting through several ads on YouTube and on podcasts. Therefore, today, since I am building my investment portfolio, I am very interested in Tucows Inc. (NASDAQ:TCX), the owner of Ting.Tucows (TSE:TC, NASDAQ:TCX) is an Internet services and telecommunications company, headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.Tucows is organized and managed into two segments: Domain Services and Network Access Services.The domain services are Tucows' mature, legacy business that generates a recurring cash flow. Tucows is the second-largest domain registrar in the world, behind GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY).It is important to note that Tucows is a registrar, not a registry. A registrar earns revenues via registration fees. It charges resellers connecting with new, renewed, and transferred domain registration. It pays out a portion of the price it receives to the registry, Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN) and ICANN, for each registered domain. Plus, with every renewal domain, it creates recurring revenue for all the parties involved.Elliot Noss, the CEO of Tucows, explains the revenue model for the domain services in this YouTube video. Tucows has numerous excellent videos that explain different aspects of the company to current investors and potential investors. I strongly recommend to watch them.The network access services are Tucows' growing business. The network access services are composed of two departments: Ting Mobile and Ting Internet.Ting MobileTing Mobile is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). It does not own the wireless infrastructure over which it provides services to customers. In fact, it leases the infrastructure from Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS).Ting's business model is different from other mobile network operators' business model. It is a pay-as-you-go plan with no fixed contract. During recent years, Ting's number of customers grew considerably due to three main reasons:It is important to know that around 11% of new customers are referred by current customers of Ting services.Ting InternetTing Internet is different from Ting Mobile. Instead of leasing an infrastructure and providing services, Ting Internet builds an infrastructure to give fiber Internet to customers. Hence, it cannot provide fiber Internet across the United States. It can only give access to gigabit fiber Internet in Ting Towns, which are presently these three municipalities:Ting is taking pre-orders to bring gigabit fiber Internet to Sandpoint, Idaho, and to Centennial, Colorado.Source: Ting InternetTing Internet's focus is to provide gigabit Internet to individuals and business customers. Just like Ting Mobile, its revenue is generated in the United States and provided on a monthly basis with no fixed contract term.According to me, the most prominent opportunity for Tucows is Ting. As of September 2017, Ting has approximately 171,000 subscribers and 281,000 devices under management. Compared to the previous year, the number of subscribers has increased by 16.33%, and the number of devices has increased by 19.57%.Number of subscribers and devices under management end of September 30Source: Company 10-QTing's gross margin has also been increasing significantly. It is currently standing at approximately 50%.Source: Company Presentation February 2017Ting has received the highest overall rating in the history of the Consumer Report survey because it provides excellent services at low prices to their customers. Thus, I do not see any reason why Ting Mobile will not be able to attract more customers in the future. By continuing to deliver the same improved services, it will have a great recurring avenue. Moreover, Ting Mobile is one of the few MVNO that can provide iPhone an AppleCare. This is important for customers because it allows them to have everything in one place and it allows to have a better integration with the services, such as Visual Voicemail and WiFi calling.As for Ting Internet, I believe it will most likely become the Internet leader in the Ting Towns where the population is relatively low. Hence, the big players will not be willing to build new infrastructures to provide Internet to the residents of these towns. The most important competitors of Ting Internet are the cable companies and the phone companies, but they are not able to give a speed similar to gigabyte Internet. Recently, Tucows has bid to buy Burlington Telecom, a publicly owned fiber network in Burlington, Vermont, for a price of $32 million. If the offer passes, Burlington will be the fourth Ting Town.Tucows CEO Elliot Noss has been running the business for more than 20 years. Even though he is not the founder, he is the biggest single shareholder. For the retail shareholder, this is a high vote of confidence that the CEO has significant stakes of his net worth in Tucows. Not only the CEO but also other leadership members have stakes in the company. In fact, according to Seeking Alpha, the inside ownership holds 24.27% of outstanding shares.According to me, the most prominent risk for Tucows is the reliance on Sprint and T-Mobile for network access. In the future, both of the companies can decide no longer to allow Ting to use their infrastructure. This is unlikely to happen, but is still possible.The legacy business, domain registration space, is mature and is becoming more competitive. Thus, I believe that it will be more challenging to grow the segment in the future.Another risk for Tucows is the currency. The majority of Tucows' revenue comes from the United States, but the operating cost is mostly in Canadian dollars.I believe Tucows is an excellent company with great potential for the future. I do not personally own Tucows in my portfolio. I think I will wait for a pullback to add a position in Tucows. If there is a decline in the market or a crisis, I will be able to become an owner for a lower price.If you disagree with my thesis, please let me know in the comments. I believe it is the best way to understand a company and to learn new things.If you liked this article and are interested to read my previous articles or my new article, a follow will be appreciated."
1907901,33291,2013-12-19T13:15:47-05:00,,"Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX) is an accredited registrar with the Internet Corporation for Assigned names and Numbers, or ICANN, and generates revenue primarily through the provision of domain registration and other Internet services to service providers who offer such services to their own customers in a process known as wholesale distribution. TCX has a solid position in the domain name registration market. It is one of the largest providers of wholesale domain name registrations in the world, with more than 8 million domain names under management. It has a large and growing distribution channel. Since entering the domain name market in January 2000, TCX has grown its distribution channel to more than 9,200 active resellers in more than 100 countries.The company has been improving operations in the last few years and has a decent balance sheet as a result of consistently generating positive cash flow from operations, providing a solid foundation for future growth. Further, 2013 has been a great year for the stock. Now, TCX is taking two major steps toward catching investors' eyes. First, the company is moving to the NASDAQ, second the company is going to implement a 1 for 4 reverse split. The justification for the reverse split is that the post-split investment prices will be more attractive for buyers, particularly institutions that often are prohibited from owning shares of stock that trade beneath $5.00. In this article, I will discuss both, with a focus on the impact of the reverse split and my recommendations for shareholders.The Move To The NASDAQTCX will transfer its U.S. stock exchange listing to the NASDAQ market from its current listing on the NYSE. Tucows' shares will continue to trade under the symbol TCX. The first day of trading on the NASDAQ is expected to be December 30, 2013. In Canada, Tucows will continue to be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and trade under the symbol TC. This move is appropriate, as the company is a tech company. President and Chief Executive Officer Elliot Noss stated:As far as the impact on the stock is concerned, it could be muted. However, for the company, greater exposure to potential clients is a key benefit of this move.When The Reverse Split Will Occur And What Will Happen to Your HoldingsIn this article, I want to explain a bit about what happens during a reverse split and highlight the implications. I will also weigh in on what investors should do with TCX ahead of the split. First, it is important to note that no other company, competitor or tech index will be affected by this split. The reverse split will be conducted at a ratio of 1 for 4 and will apply to shareholders of record at the close of the markets on December 30, 2013, and will begin trading at the adjusted price December 31, 2013. The ticker symbol for the fund will not change. The reverse split will increase the price per share of the fund with a proportionate decrease in the number of shares outstanding. In a 1 for 4 reverse split, every four pre-split shares held by a shareholder will result in the receipt of one post-split share, which will be priced four times higher than the value of the pre-split share. The following example best illustrates what to expect:Example 1: If you hold 10,000 shares of TCX priced at $3.00 each, then after the reverse split you will hold 2,500 shares valued at $12.00 each. As you can see, the reverse split does not change the value of a shareholder's investment, it still remains $30,000.TCX Fractional Shares?One of the common issues with reverse splits is the potential creation of fractional shares. Shareholders who have quantities of shares that are not a whole number with an exact multiple of the reverse split ratio will be left with what is known as a fractional share. A fractional share will be created and affect any shareholder who does not hold a number of shares that is a multiple of four. After the reverse split occurs, fractional shares are generally redeemed for cash and sent to your broker of record, generally within two to three weeks post-split. However, TCX is taking a different approach. If fractional shares are created, then TCX will round the fractions up to a full share and issue a whole number. Thus, investors win on this deal (even if it only means a couple of dollars).Those Holding TCX OptionsYou should be aware that holders of options contracts will be affected, and they are an important consideration as well. Traders who may be holding options on TCX should realize that this split will affect your contract(s), albeit minimally. Once TCX conducts the reverse split, the contract undergoes an adjustment referred to as ""being made whole."" When contracts are adjusted to be ""made whole"", it simply means that the option contract is modified accordingly so that options holders are neither negatively nor positively affected by the split. While we know the reverse split will adjust the price of the underlying shares of the TCX options, the options will be adjusted so that the changes in price due to the split do not affect the value of the options. The options clearing corporation will automatically adjust the price of all existing contracts to maintain the option market. For those who want an estimate of what their current TCX option will be worth, the calculation is rather simple.Example 2: Each TCX option contract is (generally) in control of 100 shares of TCX at some predetermined strike price. To find the new share coverage of the option after the split, you take the split ratio and multiply by the old share coverage (normally 100 shares). To find the new strike price, take the old strike price and divide by the split ratio. For example, assume you own a call option contract for 100 shares of TCX at a strike of $5.00. Since the split is 1 for 4 we divide $5.00 by 1/4, generating a new strike price of $20.00. The option will now cover 25 shares because we multiply 100 by 1/4. Thus, your new call option contract which still expires on the same day as originally scheduled, will be good for a purchase of 25 shares of TCX for $500.On your brokerage account, the contract may be adjusted to read ""TCX1"", TCX1A"" or similar and may still state it is worth 100 shares at the original price, but for redemption purposes, the contract would be redeemed for 25 shares at the post-split price. One important consideration is that volume on these contracts often dries up, especially when new contracts are written at the newer strike level. Thus, wide bid/ask prices can result.Takeaways From The SplitAfter the reverse stock split, TCX will have approximately 10.9 million common shares outstanding (reduced from approximately 43.6 million common shares outstanding), subject to rounding up of all fractional shares to the nearest whole share. The number of options outstanding following the reverse stock split will be approximately 1.6 million (reduced from approximately 6.2 million). Again, this split has implications for the future of the company's trading action.Conclusion/RecommendationsIn conclusion, TCX has had a great year. Often a reverse split is done to stocks that have been obliterated. This is not the case with TCX. Shares currently are trading at $2.82. I personally believe the stock is a buying opportunity for long-term investors looking for exposure to the domain name registration sector. In fact, buying pre-split (if you believe the company will continue to execute), can be advantageous because even though your investment value doesn't change, a higher price does tend to attract more volume and more money. To bring the product to an investment price that TCX believes is more attractive, it is conducting this reverse split. No fractional shares will be created; the company will round up your fraction and issue a whole share. Owners of options contracts will not be affected besides being faced with owning a new contract at a different strike price for a different number of shares. The total value of the contract will, however, remain the same. Despite the value of the contract not changing, I recommend not purchasing any options ahead of this split, given that volume generally dries up leading to wide bid/ask prices. Thus I recommend getting out of any options positions you may have now. My sentiment is to buy common stock ahead of the split. I think it has the potential to the number of potential investors and future equity analyst coverage. Shareholders should benefit through less volatility in the share price, lower transaction costs and greater liquidity.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

4272182,23563,2019-06-26T09:30:00-04:00,"Tucows operates two declining low quality legacy businesses and is redeploying their cash flow into an ill-fated fiber network experiment that will probably ultimately destroy capital.The company's mobile virtual network operator segment, Ting Mobile, is losing subscribers while its domains division is stagnating due to slowing industry-wide growth and market share losses.Tucows' nascent internet fiber operations, Ting Internet, is highly capital intensive and should generate low returns, or potentially negative returns.Given its struggles, Tucows will probably miss 2019 consensus revenue and profit, with shortfalls widening in 2020 and 2021.","Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX) operates two declining tech/telecom businesses and a fledgling low-return fiber division, yet is being valued by the market at 60x trailing normalized earnings. Its two profitable segments barely deserve double-digit earnings multiples, given their bleak growth profiles, and the company's cash flow is being plowed back into a third segment that will prove to be a massive destroyer of capital. TCX's valuation is wildly overstretched, and the stock is worth 50%+ less.Ting Mobile, the company's mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) division, saw subscribers peak in 2017 and has witnessed declines ever since. Historical examples of MVNO failures are abundant - like Disney/ESPN, Virgin and Amp'd Mobile - while MVNO successes are rare, and the trajectory of Ting Mobile is proving to be no different. Brutal competition, particularly from Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Xfinity Mobile as well as Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR), has reversed Ting's organic growth from several years ago into declines today, and the bleeding shows no sign of abating. Making matters worse, if the T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS)/Sprint (NYSE:S) merger goes through, we believe Ting Mobile will have to shift its customer base to another wireless provider such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) or AT&T (NYSE:T), which will likely lead to substantial churn and lower margins.Tucows' Domains business is suffering similar stagnation. Industry-wide, growth is abysmal. GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) and VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN) have been suffering low single-digit growth, while TCX's own revenue CAGR has been 1% over the last 3 years as it's been losing market share. The business is highly commoditized, with little to differentiate any individual firm other than price. TCX has been boosting prices to inflate growth metrics, but this will simply accelerate churn and share loss.Recognizing the dreary prospects of its legacy businesses, TCX management has been spinning a story about its nascent fiber operations, Ting Internet, into which it's redeploying the cash flow from the Domains and MVNO segments. Investors are being led to believe that this fiber business will deliver $1,000 in gross profit on $2,500 to $3,000 in capital invested. Our research indicates the unit economics will be far worse, with at least $4,000-5,000 in capital invested per sub and $500-650 in EBITDA per sub, which barely justifies Tucows' cost of capital. Ting Internet will ultimately prove to be negative NPV, suffering from many of the issues that have beset prior fiber builders. No public company has generated a high return fiber network successfully. After 13 years investing in fiber, Verizon cut back investment because its ROIC was in the single digits. Since launching Google Fiber in 2010, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has fired several CEOs, cut headcount dramatically and de-emphasized the division. If Google and Verizon cannot build an attractive fiber network, how can a small Canadian company with no ISP expertise? The fiber business is a fraction of TCX's total business from a revenue perspective, but we believe the market values this segment at over half of Tucows' value.Tucows will likely report a large miss versus consensus 2019 EBITDA, forcing investors to face reality and value TCX closer to a more reasonable range of $25-30 per share. Like all bad telecom businesses, Tucows' share price should soon suffer the same fate as its subscribers: churn and attrition.Tucows is a technology-focused company comprised of three primary businesses: Domain Name Services (72% of revenue & 51% of gross profit), Ting Mobile (26% of revenue & 45% of gross profit), and Ting Internet (2% of revenues & 4% of gross profit). Below is a description of the three business lines:Domains: The core Domains segment sells various domain products on a wholesale basis. Globally, they are the number 2 player in this space, yet the business is barely growing, reflecting stagnant growth across the entire industry. In the last 3 years (ending in FY18), the company's revenue CAGR was 1% for the Domains business. Recently, the company acquired one of its largest competitors at 7x EBITDA, which enhanced reported growth, but management openly admits that Domains is a low growth business.Ting Mobile: Ting Mobile is a mobile virtual network operator that leases the network infrastructure of other carriers (Sprint and T-Mobile), and resells wireless services to its own customer base on a pay-per-use pricing model. The customers Tucows services are its main asset. Ting Mobile's large concentration with Sprint and T-Mobile, as well as the business model's general lack of a moat, present large risks. There are many instances of MVNO failures and few examples of MVNO successes. Ting historically gained customers from the failure of PlatinumTel Wireless (PTel) in January 2016 and RingPlus in February 2017; both formerly MVNO competitors, but in the face of brutal competition, customer growth has reversed into a decline.Ting Internet: Tucows' Ting Internet business is an ISP that offers gigabit internet speeds at $89/month in select municipalities. The segment represents a large capex bet the company is making in hopes of future growth. Ting Internet is currently building out a fiber network in seven towns and has spent aggressively on capital investments to grow this business. Management projects 20% penetration rates in the first year and 50% within 5 years in the towns it currently operates in, but we believe these goals are highly unrealistic, given other companies' track records for penetration rates. And even if one accepts management's aggressive assumptions, we expect Tucows will have roughly 35,000 subscribers in 5 years, and those subscribers would be worth approximately $150m. Discounted to the present at 10%, that equates to $93m or $8.57/share. In reality, the business will likely fall far short of management forecasts, and like many fiber builders before it, shareholders will ultimately wish the company never embarked on its ill-conceived internet adventure.Combined together, these businesses are worth nowhere close to the $730m they're being valued at by the market. The Domains and Ting Mobile segments operate mature, highly competitive, commodity businesses that command meager valuation multiples, while the fiber network is a tiny speculative experiment trying to succeed where much larger and better-capitalized peers have failed.Insider transactions seem to agree with this sentiment. Management team members were selling stock in the $20 range in 2015 and 2016, compared to the $60 range that TCX currently trades at. There has not been a single open market purchase of stock in years. In fact, CEO Elliot Noss bought back significant amounts of stock every year after 2012 - until the stock surpassed $25.00. Noss has not purchased any meaningful amount of stock above $25. He mentions regularly that he would purchase stock when it's undervalued. Following that logic, Noss has not thought Tucows has been undervalued since trading above $25. The following is a comment from Noss concerning his thoughts on share repurchases from the company's Q1 FY16 conference call:Despite having a $40m authorization in FY17-FY19, the company has not repurchased any meaningful stock since Q2 FY16.The Domains segment is TCX's legacy business. This division provides domain name registration services via the OpenSRS, eNom and Hover brands, selling various domain products on a wholesale basis primarily to web hosting companies. Globally, TCX is the second largest player in the industry, with a market share estimated at 7%, trailing industry leader GoDaddy, which holds a 22% share.The domains market is growing very slowly as a whole. In a February 2019 presentation, GoDaddy stated: ""in the U.S., our customer base grows low single digits over time"". VeriSign stated on its February 2019 conference call: ""we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.25% and 4.25% for full year 2019"". In the last 3 years (ending in FY18), TCX's revenue CAGR in its Domains business was only 1%, and the segment has been losing market share. TCX recently acquired one of its largest competitors to boost overall segment growth, but organic growth remains atrocious.The domains business is highly commoditized, with little to differentiate any individual provider other than price. Following a number of price increases in 2017 and 2018, TCX has become the premium priced vendor in the industry. While these price increases temporarily aided revenue growth, they have also had a detrimental impact on churn and will continue to trigger declines in the company's market share.The following table and chart illustrate the declining trend in the number of domains under TCX's purview over the last few years. Note that the only real increases have been tied to acquisitions, while organic growth has been on a consistent downtrend, which we believe will continue.The company has tried to offset the declining trend in the number of domains under management by acquiring other domain registration companies, including Melbourne IT and eNom in FY16 and Ascio Technologies earlier in FY19. Going forward, there is a lack of sizable domain registration companies available to acquire, and we believe the Domains business will decline going forward without new acquisitions to offset negative organic growth.Another challenge, this time on the margin side, that TCX faces will be likely price increases from its vendor Verisign to register domain names. Registration fees paid to VeriSign represent the company's major fixed cost in its Domains business. Recently, it was announced that the US government extended the Cooperative Agreement it has with VeriSign to manage the .com domain with amendments that provide VeriSign flexibility to raise prices (which have been frozen under Obama era restrictions since 2012). These price increases could be as much as 7% in each of the final four years of its new six-year agreement, and thus would begin in 2020. Given TCX's already premium price positioning in the industry, if the company tries to pass along the price increases to its customers, that should accelerate market share losses. If it doesn't pass along price increases to customers, its profit margin will suffer.Launched in early FY12, the Ting Mobile business initially got off to a rapid start. But subscribers peaked in 2017, and there haven't been net new subscriber adds since FY17 on a year-over-year basis, as the charts below show. This slowing of growth to zero coincides with the entrance of Charter and Comcast into the market.Even as Noss has guided investors to expect growth from Ting Mobile over the past few years, Ting's subscriber count has remained stubbornly flat since 2017, with the business recently inflecting to negative growth. Ting Mobile is now a declining business with large supplier concentration at T-Mobile and Sprint. Several strong competitors have entered the market offering lower prices than Ting, as well as aggressive promotions. Growth has suffered as a result.In the most recent quarter, Ting Mobile's subscriber base declined by 3,000 on a total base of 160,000. That's a 2% subscriber decline that annualizes to a staggering 8%. Ting's growth deceleration is partly the result of Comcast and Charter ramping up their MVNO businesses. Comcast's Xfinity Mobile needed only 5 months after its launch to reach Ting's subscriber count, which Ting had accumulated painstakingly over a 5-year period. Fast forward to today, Comcast has now signed up 1.4 million mobile subscribers as of the end of March, compared with 577,000 a year earlier, making it nearly 10x larger than Ting. Charter, in turn, reported 310,000 mobile customers as of late March. Altice, another cable company, has also recently entered the MVNO business, introducing yet another player to an already crowded landscape.Ting Mobile's gross profit declined -5% y/y and -9% sequentially in its most recent quarter. Given the brutal competitive environment, we do not see significant growth going forward for this division, and Ting's multiple deep-pocketed rivals will likely drive continued subscriber attrition for Tucows' MVNO operations.Per the Q3 FY17 conference call, here are a few remarks from CEO Noss on competitors entering the MVNO space:Noss's commentary turned out to be prescient, as Ting Mobile has not grown since the entrance of the cable companies. The cable operators have offered very similar products, which was a key concern of his when cable initially launched their products. Both Comcast and Charter charge $45 a month per line for unlimited monthly data. The two also allow their customers to pay for only the data they use, between $12 and $14 per gigabyte.The T-Mobile/Sprint merger also creates more risk for Ting Mobile, and we think Ting's contract gets re-negotiated or cancelled by the new combined entity. If this occurs, Ting Mobile will have to shift its customer base to Verizon or AT&T, suffering worse pricing terms as well as subscriber attrition. This could ultimately be a disaster for the Ting Mobile business, which comprises one-third of Tucows' value.Given the low growth and large supplier concentration, further combined with aggressive, diversified competition in the space, a 10x earnings multiple is generous for this business.Ting Internet operates a difficult, capital intensive and currently unprofitable business. Management originally expected the segment to become cash flow breakeven in late 2018, but has fallen well short of its original guidance. In describing the Ting Internet business, management focuses on gross profit per sub and capex per sub. We believe the high gross profit per sub projections mask much lower profitability per sub when measured in a more relevant EBITDA per sub metric, and the company's capex per sub forecasts will prove materially too low. Management regularly ignores maintenance capex, SG&A, and the time it will take the Ting Internet business to reach maturity.Building a fiber network is a business so challenging that even Google hasn't succeeded, and today, the tech behemoth remains unsure of its own path in the sector. We believe that management's Ting Internet assumptions are unachievable, and expect Tucows will have higher capex requirements, lower penetration rates at maturity, and lower profit expectations at maturity.Below are a few quotes from a former employee in the Ting Internet division on Ting's rollout:Ting Internet is operational in 5 markets with 7,700 customers. In a previous acquisition bid for a Burlington, Vermont network, Ting was initially willing to pay ~$4,300 per customer. Applying that metric to today's 7,700 customers, the Ting Internet business would be worth $33.1 million or $3.04/share.In our sum of the parts valuation, using management's wholly unrealistic assumptions, our DCF arrives at $8.57/share. That DCF assumes the Ting Internet business reaches 35,000 subscribers in 5 years, which would imply a future valuation of $150 million (assuming $4,300 in value per sub). Discounted back to the present using a 10% discount rate gets us to $93 million in present value, or $8.57 a share. This analysis implies success in the Ting Internet segment, but we discuss below that we believe Ting internet will likely actually destroy capital.To begin with, no other deep-pocketed public company or private equity firm is entering the fiber market in small municipalities. If the returns were as lucrative as Tucows claims, we believe numerous companies would be investing in the sector.Laying fiber is a difficult business with uncertain economics, and it takes 5 to 10 years to find out if the returns justify the massive capital and expense outlay. Permitting efforts, municipality negotiations, local government lobbying, and cumbersome town hall meetings translate into a laborious, unpredictable and costly workflow. Setbacks are frequent and are part of why Tucows has missed its original financial targets for the division.Based on conversations we've had with industry experts and from looking at other industry penetration rates, we think the probability of 50% penetration rates for Ting Internet is very low. It took Verizon's fiber business 13 years and a tremendous amount of investment to reach a 40% penetration rate. Capex per customer metrics end up much higher with lower penetration rates, because the fixed amount of spend only becomes reasonable if leveraged across a large customer base. This makes the Ting Internet experiment very risky, because Ting Internet could actually end up destroying large sums of capital if the business doesn't meet management's targeted penetration rates, resulting in the IRR of fiber investments coming in well below the company's cost of capital. Ting Internet has not proven profitable in any markets yet. Even if some markets do become profitable, that doesn't mean that on a consolidated basis the entirety of the division would be profitable. And, we already give them credit for profitability in valuing Ting Internet at a mere $8.57/share today, even though we think that the assumptions behind that value are wholly unrealistic. Should Ting Internet destroy capital (which we think is quite likely, given this is what occurred with Google and other players), the internet business isn't simply worthless; it would actually have a material negative value. We think management has taken a very optimistic view on the Ting Internet segment which is not backed up by industry data and historical experience.Three public companies that have tried to be profitable in fiber are Verizon, Nelnet (NYSE:NNI) (through its subsidiary Allo Communications), and Google. All three have decided to slow down the rollout of their fiber networks as they have experienced meagre returns on capital amidst missed expectations.We take a look at each of these three operators.VerizonVerizon spent 13 years in the fiber space through its Fios segment and ultimately got to 40% penetration rates on average across its markets. However, even with this success, Verizon's returns have been low. Management describes the segment's ROIC in Fios as ""positive, but in the single digits."" Tucows' cost of capital is 8%, so it is quite possible that after 13 years building out Fios, Verizon did not earn Tucows' cost of capital. Additionally, Verizon has entirely shifted away from the Fios business and was recently actually selling assets in that space. Verizon says it doesn't believe that the ROIC's of further building out point-to-point fiber are attractive, and this is even after it already has a sizeable fiber network with 40% penetration rates. Verizon didn't buy Charter or Zayo (NYSE:ZAYO) because it was worried about sinking even more capital into the fiber business.Allo Communications, a Nelnet subsidiaryBelow are the operating results and key performance indicators of Allo Communications, the fiber subsidiary of Nelnet Inc.Allo Communications is hoping to get to 40-50% penetration rates within 5-7 years, and also offers triple play services. Nelnet IR admitted that the business would likely get much lower penetration rates if it were not offering TV and phone services (which Ting Internet currently does not offer). Nelnet also feels that a mature customer generates about $500-$600 in EBITDA per sub. Tucows boasts $1,000 in gross profit per sub, but once one factors in expenses below the gross profit line, the likely EBITDA per sub would be more in line with Nelnet's, or lower. Thus far, it looks like Nelnet is nowhere near hitting its numbers. Additionally, Nelnet's current capex per home is between $2,100 and $2,400. At a 40% penetration rate and $2,250 average capex per home, this equates to $5,625 capex per home passed. At this rate, Ting Internet would not earn its cost of capital. The other interesting comment we found from Nelnet is that Nelnet is slowing down its capex spending, because management wants to ensure that the capital they have already invested will actually generate a good return. Nelnet has spent roughly $300m in capex over the course of multiple years, and yet management is still unsure if the project will generate an appropriate return on capital. Clearly, Nelnet is lukewarm on its investment in the fiber business, even years into the project and despite having a very strong relationship with the city of Lincoln, Nebraska where the company operates. There is nothing from neither Nelnet's numbers nor management's commentary that inspires us to be bullish on Ting Internet's business.GoogleGoogle Fiber has also failed to meet expectations. Since first embarking on its fiber buildout in 2010, Google Fiber is now on its 4th CEO. In 2016, Google pulled back from its original plan, curtailing its expansion and cutting 1,500 employees. Today, the company is thoroughly re-assessing the health of its fiber business.Numerous news stories highlight Google Fiber's struggles:https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/10/25/google-fiber-halts-rollout-ceo-leaves/92746288/https://qz.com/820472/dismissing-google-fiber-goog-as-a-failure-is-the-same-mistake-we-made-bringing-electricity-to-rural-america/https://gizmodo.com/when-google-fiber-abandons-your-city-as-a-failed-experi-1833244198https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-google-fiber-failed-5-reasons/As the 2016 USA Today article notes:Tucows' Ting Internet division operates the same business as Verizon Fios, Allo Communications, and Google Fiber, three far better capitalized companies that have had disappointing results in this business. Tucows' CEO Elliot Noss himself has admitted on conference calls that execution for this business is a major risk, and thus far the business is unprofitable.If Google and Verizon cannot operate a fiber network with returns on capital they feel are adequate, it is hard to believe that Ting Internet will. Yet today, given the clear declines of the domains and mobile segments, it appears that investors are attributing Tucows' lofty valuation primarily to the promise of Ting Internet. Naturally, we see meaningful downside to price targets as the fiber rollout at Tucows proves much more difficult than modeled.From a 2017 Tucows Conference call:Noss says he wants to ""get okay and then good and then great."" We are not convinced he is close yet to being ok in this business, yet Ting Internet is being valued as a ""great"" and exciting open-ended growth story by the stock market.In summary, all of the major public peers who have entered the fiber business have regretted it, and several other public peers who know the fiber business very well have avoided it entirely. There is a consensus in the industry that the returns on capital in fiber are very low, contradictory to what Tucows claims.Share Mispricing Due To Unrealistic ""Consensus"" Forecasts, Which Will Have To Be Cut DramaticallyA major reason for the mispricing of the shares is the unrealistic future ""consensus"" expectations, which make the shares screen more attractive than they should. One of the factors behind this is that a number of US and Canadian sell-side brokers who had covered the company in the past have dropped coverage for one reason or another. Our understanding is that as a result of this, ""consensus"" expectations are now accounted for by one small sell-side broker, and it's unclear how current the analyst's estimates are, especially considering the significant shortfall in revenues and profitability in the recently reported Q1 results.Nonetheless, the important point is that the ""consensus"" expectations are unrealistic and will have to be significantly reduced. In the table below, we have modeled historic results with CapIQ consensus estimates. We modeled the ""consensus"" estimates for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS and made assumptions for the other line items based on historical trends. The table illustrates how unrealistic current estimates are, especially for the Ting Internet business. Even if we assume a reversal of recent declines at both TCX's Domains & Ting Mobile businesses to show a modest 2% revenue CAGR (which we believe is highly unlikely), the consensus expectations are predicated on a spectacular acceleration in the company's Ting Internet growth beginning in the current quarter. Notably, our model shows that consensus expectations suggest that the Q4 Ting Internet revenue is projected to be almost 6x the Q1 figure and nearly as much as the cumulative revenues recorded by the division since it was established in FY15.Additionally, our model shows that the acceleration in Ting Internet is expected to continue into both FY 20 and FY 21, with revenues and profitability for both in FY 21 expected to jump about 10 x from the FY 18 results. Not only is this growth unrealistic on the surface, it is not consistent with the capital requirements and potential revenue contribution of the business. Specifically, even considering a 40% penetration rate (which we think is completely unrealistic as it is currently running under 25%) on its 102,800 potential serviceable addresses (which will not be completed by FY 21), and using the current monthly revenue per sub of $110, we get annual revenue of about $55 million. This number needs to be further adjusted for average subscribers in a year, which reduces the above unrealistic FY 21 revenue potential to only about $45 million. As our model shows, assuming a 2% revenue CAGR in the FY 19- FY 21 period for the Domains and Ting Mobile businesses (whose revenues have been actually declining, not growing), the revenue contribution from the Ting Internet business (given the ""consensus"" FY 21 revenue forecast of $442 million) would need to be $82 million. This is well above the unrealistic scenario revenue contribution from full deployment of the network.Our Base Case Model Shows EBITDA & EPS Stalling Out At Roughly Current Levels and Significantly Below ""Consensus"" ForecastsWe believe the significant shortfall in recently reported Q 1 revenue and profitability represents a significant turning point in the company's financials. Reported revenue was 5% below CapIQ consensus forecasts, while EPS was 17% below expectations. Moreover, both of TCX' s legacy businesses, Domains and Ting Mobile, reported disappointing results, including significant revenue and profit declines. Revenue in the Domains business declined 23% y/y and 8% q/q. This is the most significant revenue decline we have seen in this segment. Additionally, Ting Mobile has also now recorded two consecutive 5% q/q declines in the most recent two quarters. In the Ting Internet business, while revenues grew q/q, the y/y growth rate moderated and, more importantly, a decline in margins resulted in a q/q drop in profitability. These factors resulted in a 9% y/y decline in adjusted EBITDA and lower EPS on a y/y basis.Our base case model assumes that both the Domains and Ting Mobile businesses will show about flat growth from current levels in the FY 19-FY 21 period while Ting Internet will show revenue growth of roughly 40% in FY 19, which moderates to ~25% in FY 21. Our model assumes penetration levels will remain at ~25% with cash flows from the mature Domains and Ting Mobile divisions providing the capital to support this growth. Should these two segments enter a negative growth phase, TCX may have to slow the expansion of Ting Internet. On balance, we see the growth from Ting Internet offsetting the flat growth from the two older legacy operations, resulting in adjusted EBITDA remaining close to the roughly $50 million annual run rate and adjusted EPS in the $1.60-1.75 annual range. The company's revenue and EBITDA shortfalls relative to consensus estimates will become even more pronounced in 2020 and 2021, given that we have Tucows' revenue and EBITDA flat in those years.Tucows would have to resort to a large acquisition to avoid these looming misses, but this is increasingly unlikely as the company's debt levels rise and its fiber business soaks up all of the free cash flow.Our Price Target Is $25-30/Share, Or Less Than Half the Current Share PriceWhether we look at Tucows on a sum-of-the-parts basis or using a P/E multiple, we come to a much lower valuation than current trading levels.P/E BasisAs the company's new profitability/EPS growth dynamics become understood in the market, we believe the valuation multiple of TCX shares will significantly contract. Giving credit to the optimism regarding Ting Internet, a reasonable P/E for the combined businesses would be slightly below a market multiple, or roughly 15-18x EPS. On that basis, given the roughly $1.75/share in EPS power of the combined company over the next few years, shares should trade at approximately $25-30/share, or less than half of the current share price.Sum-of-the-Parts AnalysisOur sum of the parts analysis, which we show at the top of this section, yields a similar result. If we assume Domains and Ting Mobile combined generate $42m of EBITDA (assuming Ting Internet generates $2 million), at a generous 7x EBITDA that would result in $294m in value. Our 7x EBITDA multiple can be substantiated using the comp from Tucows' acquisition of eNom at 6x, and other comparable companies' valuations of 6-7x EBITDA. Giving the Fiber business a value of $93 million, and subtracting the net debt of $93 million, we arrive at a valuation of $27/share. On a P/E basis for valuing the Domains and Ting Mobile businesses, we use a 10x earnings valuation multiple. That yields a valuation of $27, in line with other methods."
2114323,25432,2014-03-29T08:46:28-04:00,Tucows is an under the radar technology company with growth prospects at a reasonable price.The business is led by a savvy and shareholder friendly CEO with solid capital allocation skills.A recently announced $20 million share buyback plan provides share price support and is a tax friendly way to remunerate shareholders.,"If you listen to a lot of podcasts, you are probably aware of Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX), or at least of their two retail operating businesses: (1) Hover and (2) Ting Mobile. Podcast advertising is just one indication that Tucows is a scrappy, bootstrapping internet company -- it knows its target market -- and advertising via podcasts is certainly cheaper and higher ROI than other forms of broadcast communication.Tucows remains under the radar, but it is a capital light technology company with a savvy CEO (Elliot Noss) who is very shareholder friendly. To wit: since 2006, Tucows has taken nearly half of its shares outstanding off the table (after adjusted for a reverse 1 for 4 stock split in December 2013). Speaking of the reverse stock split, this was a shareholder friendly move in my view because it adjusted the price per share above $10, bringing Tucows firmly in the purview of institutional investors.TCX data by YChartsIn March 2014, Tucows announced another $20 million share repurchase program, which is good for about 14% of the company at current prices. This should help put a floor in the stock price as Tucows is an aggressive buyer of its own stock.How is Tucows able to buy back so much stock? Well, it runs a very light capital intensity set of businesses.Tucow's businesses include:Domain ServicesDomain Services is a predictable and stable business, where Tucows is an incumbent. Tucows earns revenue from two streams, its retail and wholesale arms.The way the business model works is Tucows will sell domain names via its retail site (Hover) or its partners will sell a domain name to their customers. Depending on the type of domain name (.com, .net, etc), wholesale customers will pay Tucows a set amount, then Tucows will allocate a certain portion of the sale to the registry (Verisign) and ICANN, the regulator for domain names. The difference between the sale price of the domain name to the end user and the fees paid to ICANN and the registry is Tucows' margin.This business is incredibly steady in terms of revenue, margins and cash flow generation. By itself, the Domain Services segment is a good business, but doesn't contain much growth.To ramp growth at Tucows, management recently introduced what I believe is a game changing business called Ting which I believe will be a catalyst for increasing Tucows' valuation.TingAre you tired of paying the legacy telcos enormous sums for monthly service? So am I. That is why I am in the process of finding a Sprint compatible phone in order to dump my current provider and become a Ting customer. Ting is the underlying business in Tucows Network Access Services segment.Ting was launched in early 2012, and operates using the Sprint network. I understand that the Ting business model is such that it rents network infrastructure from Sprint on an as needed basis (dependent on usage of Ting customers) making it very capital efficient for Tucows and allows Sprint to further monetize its network without additional customer acquisition costs. Ting then passes the savings on to consumers. The model is unique in that Ting does not subsidize phones or require long-term commitments, and the pricing is variable based on what consumers use. It is a way to empower mobile users to take control of their monthly charges, a value proposition I think will work quite well in the new normal economic paradigm (e.g., more with less) we find ourselves these days. For a quick overview, see this video.The concept appears to be catching on. Revenues for Ting increased from $4 million in 2012 to $16.5 million in 2013, a 400%+ increase. There is plenty of tarmac for growth as well, considering the wireless communication sector is a multi-billion dollar industry and consumers are actively looking for ways to manage their monthly overhead.The cost savings are staggering, and I suspect consumers who are comfortable with the Sprint network will be happy to switch to Ting as it becomes more well known. It is hard to say what Ting is worth today given it is in its early innings of growth, but I would suggest that Ting represents a cheap or free call option on the Tucows' share.CatalystsRight now, I am not aware of any pure play comparables with respect to either of Tucows businesses. However, I understand that Demand Media (DMD) is in the process of spinning out its domain registry business (Rightside) later this year, providing a publicly-traded comparable in which to assess Tucows' Hover business. This could prompt a re-rating of Tucows.In terms of Ting, I also am not aware of any comps in which to perform a relative value analysis. The incumbent telcos aren't good comps because of the different operating models: the incumbents have high capex to maintain their infrastructure, meanwhile Ting remains very capital light in terms of renting infrastructure space and passing savings off to its customers.Once Ting is more established, one way to compare it might be to assess the lifetime value of the customer relationship to other subscription type businesses. In this case, magicJack (NASDAQ:CALL) might be a good proxy of value, as it operates in the same industry and is innovating both in terms of developing a disruptive telecommunications technology and unique value proposition for its customers. This, too, could prompt a re-rating in Tucows' shares.ConclusionTucows is a very shareholder friendly company, and operates a set of complementary businesses: (1) a predictable, steady domain registrar business and (2) a growth mobile telco business that is attempting to disrupt a huge industry with lumbering incumbents.At the current $140 million market cap, I think there is little risk of permanent downside, and a rather good chance of Tucows becoming a meaningfully larger company if it executes its growth strategy (Ting) and returns value to shareholders in an accretive manner (buybacks).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in TCX over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
2307035,64043,2014-07-10T19:10:53-04:00,"Recent T-Mobile investigation helps exemplify why people move to Ting.Continued Sprint network build-out will help Ting improve service and lower churn.EBITDA, cash flow, and revenues should all accelerate in 2015 as Ting contributes more and more.","Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX) is a company whose stock has a high probability of becoming a 2-3 bagger in the next two years as the company's wireless segment, Ting, becomes a significantly larger contributor of TCX' operating profit.Ting just passed the two-year mark, and has been accelerating customer adds while expanding margins at the same time. As the larger carriers continue to offer inflexible and overpriced wireless plans with poor customer service, consumers will continue to shift towards cheaper and more customer friendly solutions. TCX is a well-managed company that has proven to be a great operator, and has been growing Ting organically in a controlled fashion while also keeping the rest of the business stable. As Ting begins to ramp considerably in the next year and beyond, the company will show significant flow-through to the bottom line. There is significant downside protection as the company is profitable in both segments, while also building up its cash balance and pursuing share repurchases. The CEO, Elliot Noss is one of the best when it comes to shareholder friendly CEOs, having skillfully reduced the shares outstanding by 50 percent during his tenure as CEO.Recently, T-Mobile was accused by the FTC of cramming. The result was hundreds of millions of unauthorized additional charges being added to subscribers' bills without their knowledge. While it's obvious that wireless companies may not have the greatest concern for their customers, it's a bit outrageous that a company who is already charging an arm and a leg for service will continue to tack on additional monthly fees. T-Mobile has now been criticized and sensationalized in mass media, which may cause customers to look elsewhere for better, more customer friendly solutions.This is where Ting comes in. Ting is all about customer service. For example, when you call in, you always get a real service agent without going through the hoops of an automated prompt. Ting even makes fun of this in its YouTube channel. This video was released last month and became its second most viewed video in a short amount of time. These aren't outsourced overseas agents that are reading off a script, but knowledgeable individuals based in Toronto and St. Catharines (a new facility that recently opened, relatively close to Niagara Falls). Ting also has an e-mail policy in which if you are unable to reach an agent during business hours, you can e-mail and receive a response within 24 hours. Anecdotally, Ting's Facebook, blog, and Twitter channels are filled with customers who love the service and the money they have saved.The company culture itself is also very honest and transparent. For example, when the Nexus 5 was released for Ting, the company released this blog post. The company also posts timely videos and hosts online roundtables in which executives answer crowdsourced questions. They talk about why they don't offer unlimited data, why rollover minutes don't exist, and why they get some devices quicker than others. Compared to T-Mobile, Ting is treating its customers with respect and attention, regardless of if the customer is paying $10/month or $100/month. Over the past few years, I've seen many other companies shift their focus towards better customer service as a way to differentiate themselves.Furthermore, Ting has been lowering rates. Normally, price cuts occur because a company is losing share and is trying to do whatever it can to make up volume. However, Ting has actually been growing north of 100%. It is taking share away from the Verizons and AT&Ts of the world and have a significant runway for growth (~60k current customers versus the tens and hundreds of millions for the larger players). The company stated in the last earnings call that even though it lowered Ting's price, the gross margins remained in the targeted range.In fact, 98% of people that are using another carrier would save money coming to Ting. Unless you are a heavy user, Ting will save you money. The easiest way to visualize this is to use the Ting calculator, but you can also just take a quick look at rates:Ting:Source: Ting websiteVerizon's lowest individual plan:Source: Verizon websiteAT&T's lowest individual plansource: AT&T websiteTing doesn't offer unlimited plans, but if you do the math, unless a person is using over 1,000 minutes a month in voice and 2,000 texts, Ting would be the cheaper option. Furthermore, since Ting doesn't lock you into a contract or a specific tier (you pay what you use per month), if you use less in a specific month, you pay less that month. Data overage on Ting is actually the same (per MB) once a user moves towards the higher data usage range as well.Ting can maintain this cost advantage over time because it is much more disciplined on customer acquisition costs compared to the big carriers. Ting attempted TV advertising in the past, but realized that it was very inefficient for the cost. Instead, the company focuses on viral and social advertising through podcasts, YouTube videos, and strong social media channels. Given the current size of Ting (currently only 60k customers), it is also able to fly under the radar of the big 4 carriers and take the low hanging fruit. These big carriers are not willing to dramatically lower prices in order to capitalize on the tens and hundreds of thousands of subscribers that Ting is converting over. They have retail spaces to build, network towers to maintain, and costly marketing budgets to support.Ting uses the Sprint network, which in the past has lagged the other carriers. However, Sprint is rapidly building out its 4G LTE network with the release of Sprint Spark, Clearwire towers, and after partnering with the Competitive Carriers Association and NetAmerica earlier this year. The company expects to have coverage for over 250m Americans by mid-year (it hasn't updated this yet, so it might have already achieved its target). The Sprint Spark expansion puts the network on par or better compared to the other carriers, and the Clearwire acquisition gave it access of the 2.5 GHz spectrum, which helps offset the load in high-traffic markets.Lastly, and probably most importantly, Ting does not lock its users into any contracts. Customers can leave whenever they want, but due to the great customer service, the company is anecdotally experiencing less churn than other MVNOs and nearly as good as the Verizon and AT&T (churn for wireless carriers is typically calculated outside of the first month, when most of the customers can still cancel contracts). Ting has stated that presently churn is higher than expected due to the Sprint build-out, but once this build-out is complete the churn numbers should be more normalized and released publicly.Overall, it's encouraging to see that Ting is so successful and yet uses a sub-optimal network. As Sprint continues to invest and catch up compared to the other carriers, I would expect churn rates to decrease and adoption and new customer adds to increase for Ting.The core domains business should also reaccelerate as the new gTLDs come live. There has been minimal impact so far because ICANN is releasing the less attractive gTLDs first. As the more impactful gTLDs go live over the next year (such as .shop, .web, and .app), TCX will be a main beneficiary as one of the largest registrars in the industry. These new gTLDs are priced significantly higher than existing ones, at $40-60 a year, compared to .com or .net which costs $10-15 a year. Furthermore, looking out into 2015 and beyond, many of these domain names will need to be renewed at a higher rate than the current promotional prices.A lot of talk has concerned the prospect of large companies entering the gTLD sweepstakes (Google, Apple, to name a few) but these companies are applying to be registries, whereas TCX is a registrar. TCX acts as a reseller, who will buy domain names from these companies and resell to either another reseller (TCX acts as a wholesaler), or to retail in the same manner as GoDaddy.com. Therefore, the entire industry will see an uptick as the expansion of gTLDs creates a land grab opportunity for the entire supply chain.As Ting continues to become a bigger part of the revenue mix, I expect EBITDA and cash flow to increase significantly. On the last earnings call, the CEO stated that Ting is already three quarters the size of the wholesale domains business in gross profit dollars. Ting has only been around for two years, and is expected to exceed the wholesale domains business in gross profit by the end of the year. Ting also operates at a much higher gross margin (45%+, net of equipment sales) than the wholesale business, and is growing at a much faster pace (estimated to be 100% revenue growth this year). Furthermore, Ting's main operating costs are service reps, and as the new customer service center scales, we should get significant operating leverage in the model.Given the pace of Ting's growth in customers, I believe that Ting will grow customers 100% in 2014, 70% in 2015, and 40% in 2016. As the operating leverage kicks in, Ting will double the overall company's EBITDA by 2016.Excluding repurchases, I believe that looking forward to 2016, the company will be doing close to $2.40/share in EBITDA and be worth a 10x multiple. Including the cash on the balance sheet, the stock should be worth $26 to $28 a share. Including repurchases, I see the stock being north of $30/share.My downside case assumes that Ting is only able to add customers at the same pace as the past (it has accelerated absolute customer adds in every quarter). As a result, the segment only grows 50% in 2015 and 30% in 2016. The wholesale domains business does not accelerate and grows at the low-single digits. With these assumptions, the company will generate closer to $1.80/share in EBITDA in 2016. At a 7x multiple, and disregarding any cash on the balance sheet, the company is worth $12.60/share.My bull case assumes that Ting grows at the base rate, but that the operating leverage is closer to the larger carriers as the company scales. The new gTLDs will help the rest of the business grow near the double-digit range, leading to $2.75/share in EBITDA with no repurchases. TCX typically converts 70-80% of EBITDA to free cash flow, so given the repurchases in place ($20m authorized in 2014, double the amount from prior years), the company will be generating closer to $4/share in EBITDA. At this level, with a 10x multiple, the company is worth $40/share in two years.As of today's price of $13.24, my base case expects 100% upside in two years. The downside is 5%, and is further supported by the company's repurchase plan. The bull case generates a triple from today's stock price. It's important to note that I'm not factoring in any multiple expansion - this is purely a margin and growth story. The company has zero US sell-side coverage but is closely owned by management and a few hedge funds. The CEO owns 7% of the company and out of the top 10 shareholders, 9 of them have added to their positions in their latest filings. If you don't do the work and just look at EBITDA and the overall growth rate of the company, you are really misunderstanding how different the company will look in 1-2 years. It is in the early stages of exponential growth, which will really start showing in 2015 and beyond. As I mentioned earlier, the CEO, Elliot Noss, has been opportunistic and aggressive acquirer of the company's stock - both in the open market and through Dutch tenders. I believe that these actions provide both downside support and potentially substantial accretion to EBITDA numbers over the next couple years that are also not included in market expectations.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1977451,25047,2014-01-30T14:38:53-05:00,,"At heart, Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX) is a stable, rather stagnated, business. It's a mixture of legacy businesses including a wholesale and retail internet registrar, plus a portfolio of domain names and a download website.In regards to the the wholesale internet registrar, Tucows manages over fourteen million domain names and millions of value-added services through a reseller network of over 13,000 web hosts and ISPs.Tucows ""legacy"" businesses throw off reliable if uninspiring cash flows and earnings year after year. They're enough for Tucows to be profitable and debt-free (on a net basis). This part of Tucows' business is likely to continue rather unchanged or growing slowly over time.The thesisThe reason why Tucows merits an article, however, is not due to its legacy business. The legacy business just provides a measure of safety, providing revenues of $126.6 million on a TTM basis.The true reason to highlight Tucows is its new initiative, Ting. Ting is a MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) running on Sprint's (NYSE:S) network. Ting launched in February 2012 and as of last quarter (September 2013) it had 36,000 accounts and 56,000 devices, having gained 11,000 accounts and 16,000 devices during the quarter. This represents an acceleration since the gain for the last 9 months was 26,000 subscribers and 41,000 devices.Also, according to Tucows, Ting expects to reach breakeven in Q4 2013 (which will be reported on February 12).But why is Ting so relevant? The reason is simple: it brings with it the promise of growth. And maybe even profitable growth at that. For a company doing $126.6 million in revenues, launching a mobile operator is bound to lead to significant revenue growth as long as it can gather the subscribers. And seemingly, Ting is being able to grab those subscribers.This becomes readily apparent if we look at the latest quarterly report (red highlight is mine):The ""Retail"" segment includes Ting, and Ting is the reason why it's expanding quickly - it grew 131.4% to $6.86 million (or 19% of revenues) in the latest quarter. And more importantly, this growth is bound to continue due to the expansion of the subscriber base.Given the size of the ""Retail"" segment, it is now large enough that as it grows, it pushes the entire company into sustainable double-digit revenue growth. In a market starved for growth stocks, Tucows is becoming one, yet it's not trading as one at this point, since it trades for just 1 times sales. Tucows thus stands a good chance of being re-priced as a growth stock in the near future, as the market becomes aware of this dynamic.Furthermore, public awareness might be helped by Ting's advertising, such as the one where Ting offers a free Starbucks coffee to all 200 million mobile customers in the U.S.Other developmentsWhile not central to the thesis, there are a couple of developments which I ought also to cover. These include:Main risksI see two main risks to Tucows:ConclusionTucows has a profitable and stable business in its legacy business operations. This provides it with the base to attain growth, something which it is in the process of achieving through the launch and nurturing of Ting.Ting makes it likely that Tucows will show sustained double-digit revenue growth over the foreseeable future. This might lead to a re-rating of Tucows as a growth stock. Tucows presently trades at just 1 times sales, so the re-rating could entail significant upside.Disclosure: I am long TCX.

156129,20101,2009-08-14T06:13:00-04:00,,"Tucows (Amex:TCX) may be best known for its eponymous website that distributes freeware and shareware, but most of Tucows’ revenues come from its Open SRS domain platform. At heart, Tucows is a domain registration business whose fortunes will rise and fall with the vitality of the internet, the margins of domain registrars, and its ability to protect and take market share.Wednesday, Tucows reported Q2 2009 revenues of $20.0 million, down slightly from $20.5 million for Q2 2008, and net income of $4.5 million, or $0.07 per share, up from $2.2 million, or $0.03 per share, last year. The earnings were not all from operations — there were unusual gains of $2.0 million from the sale of an equity investment, $0.6 million related to assignment of patents, and $1.6 million from foreign currency exchange effects (note: last year’s results also benefited from some one-time gains).Back all these items out, together with a tax expense net of R & D credits of $0.6 million, and adjusted earnings drop to about $900,000, or just above a penny per share. That’s a very clean, conservative number.But the real strength of Tucows can be seen in other metrics:In the earnings call (transcript courtesy of Seeking Alpha), CEO Noss commented:trend Δ (update)DISCLOSURE: Long TCX."
152782,22820,2009-07-31T04:30:35-04:00,,"In the past, we’ve profiled a handful of microcap companies (FNET, KSW, LIMC, RMCF), either with discernible competitive advantages, particularly rational management, or an imminent catalyst for unlocking shareholder value.We continue in that vein today by profiling Tucows, Inc. (NASDAQ:TCX), an ICANN-accredited internet domain registrar based in Toronto that manages email services and over nine million web domains. Through its subsidiary Butterscotch.com, it also owns one of the oldest and most popular software download sites on the Internet. At present, its principal shareholders include: Lacuna, LLC, which controls 17.7% of outstanding shares (as of 3/23/09), Diker GP LLC (13.7%), and Fertilemind Capital Fund I, LP (5.7%).About two-thirds of Tucows’ revenue derives from its wholesale domain registration services, being the third largest ICANN-accredited registrar in the world and the largest publicly traded. And like other domain registry servicers (e.g., Network Solutions, GoDaddy), its business model is characterized by non-refundable, up-front payments, which generate predictable, positive operating cash flows. More specifically, Tucows receives payment for the annual registration fee prior to providing the full cost of the service, yet it is required to book those payments and costs incrementally. Looking at its balance sheet, one sees what—at first glance—may appear to be a highly-levered, capital-intensive business with nearly $97 million in assets and $75 million in liabilities. Yet, the bulk of these assets and liabilities pertain to prepaid fees and deferred revenues for their domain registry business. In truth, then, Tucows is a cash-rich and largely unlevered business that fills its checking account faster than its earnings statement would indicate. In a way, its revenue resembles an insurance premium—non-refundable, and paid up-front—and enables Tucows to keep its cost of capital very low and perhaps even negative.However, it is not only the balance sheet that masks Tucows’ virtues. In 2008, Tucows took initial steps to divest non-strategic assets and concentrate energies on its most profitable businesses. This process has complicated its cash flow statements and masked its significant free cash flow growth. For example, in 2006, depreciation and amortization charges of $3.9 million were less than capital expenditures ($4.6 million); in 2008, depreciation and amortization charges of $4.8 million far exceeded capex ($2.1 million). Because Tucows has significant amortization expenses—deriving from the intangible assets of previous acquisitions (i.e., customer relationships)—it has far more cash coming into the company today than its reported earnings reveal.Last, Tucows has raised more cash in the last year by liquidating its $7.5 million equity stake in Afilias and a portion of its domain name portfolio. In their second quarter results (coming out in mid-August), Tucows will book a $2 million pre-tax gain on a portion of its Afilias stake; an additional $2 million pre-tax gain will also follow later this year.Perhaps most interesting though is where all that cash is likely to go. In the last year, Tucows has used some cash to pay down its long term debt, repurchased 4.2 million shares (about 6% of those outstanding) in a “Dutch Auction” tender offer in March 2009, and repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares in a second “Dutch Auction” tender offer in July 2009. And to date, Tucows has ample room remaining in its $10 million stock repurchase program. Though the future capital allocation decisions are difficult to predict, the chains of habit are not easily tossed aside.All told, Tucows strikes me as a relatively low margin business with low (and perhaps negative) capital costs that has deployed its retained earnings profitably for shareholders in recent years. Though GoDaddy is the dominant player in the sector, Tucows has added customers and concentrated its business lines. If Tucows continues to divest its non-strategic assets and contain its costs, I would not be surprised to see them earn more than $7 million this year ($4.5 million from operations and $2.5 from after-tax sale of investments). With a market cap of $29 million (as of 7/30/09), management and the Board should have an opportunity to buy back shares quite cheaply.That is, unless enterprising investors find it first.Disclosure: I, or persons whose accounts I manage, own shares of Tucows at the time of this writing."
43813,20988,2007-08-08T02:26:22-04:00,,"Tuesday morning Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX) reported record revenue and record adjusted net income for the second quarter. So why is the stock trading down more than 15%?
Looking more closely at the numbers, things were less encouraging. Revenues included $3 million from a one time sale of 2,500 domain names. Without this sale, earnings would have been essentially flat with year ago numbers. This quarter's revenue and earnings were weighed down by a decline in new domain name registrations due to m&a activity within their customer base as well as the loss of major customer Registerfly. Google ad revenues were also weaker.
Separately, Tucows announced a price reduction for wholesale domain registrations.
On the conference call, CEO Elliot Noss seemed to accentuate the negative, even for some of the positive aspects of the quarter. He stressed that the $3 million domain name sale was ""atypical"" and suggested that the overall level of domain name sales for the next two years might be less than this. He described the wholesale domain registration price reduction as ""an expensive choice to make"" and would not quantify a financial impact.
Here are the counterpoints:
The $3 million domain name sale which was described as ""atypical"" could be better described as ""demonstrative"" of the value of Tucows' extensive domain name portfolio. Tucows owns tens of thousands of domain names including the Netidentity portfolio of surname domain names. Tucows carries the entire surname portfolio on their balance sheet as a $12 million intangible asset. (This seems undervalued compared to some recently announced big ticket domain name sales.) The value of their premium and expired domain name portfolio is not reflected on their books at all, since there was no cost associated with acquiring the domain names. These portfolios together represent significant, latent, unrecognized value.
Second, the domain registration price reduction has been a long time coming. While the number of total domain registrations under Tucows management continues to grow, their market share has been dropping. Tucows has already been giving price reductions to some of their higher volume customers in order to stay competitive. 
The number of actual registrations which will be impacted by the price reduction was not stated. The price reduction will help Tucows maintain and possibly increase their market share in the competitive domain name space. The revenue impact of the price decrease should be somewhat offset by the impending Verisign registry fee increase coming in October. The margin impact may also be offset by higher sales volumes as new registrants take advantage of the lower pricing.
Bottom line - this quarter's results were disappointing, but the stock price reaction is overdone.

47512,20988,2007-09-18T08:09:53-04:00,,"In early August, Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX) dropped sharply following their second quarter earnings release. Tucows's decline was joined by other domain related stocks which also logged double digit percentage declines in August. Since second quarter earnings, the company has been relatively quiet with a few notable items: Tucows appointed Bill Sweetman as General Manager of its domain name portfolio. In his role, he will be dedicated to improving the quality and profitability of the Tucows domain portfolio. This can be viewed as a positive step towards more effectively monetizing their domain assets. On September 14, Tucows CEO Elliot Noss purchased 20,000 shares of TCX on the open market at $1.05 per share. Over the years, he has been a steady buyer of Tucows shares and the most recent purchase shows a vote of confidence in the company's long term prospects. In other ongoing developments: Tucows had acquired wholesale domain registrar ItsYourDomain.com (IYD) in late July. IYD had roughly 700,000 domains under management and offers services through a network of over 2,500 affiliates. There have been no updates on the integration, but at the time it was expected to add approximately $7 million in yearly revenue and $1- $2 million in adjusted net income in the first 12 months. Tucows had announced a reduction in their wholesale pricing. This has been implemented and extended to .mobi and .name domain names. With the third quarter drawing to a close, it's difficult to difficult to determine how the acquisition, the price decrease, and other possible nonrecurring items such as domain name sales might affect results. However, in the second quarter earnings release, Tucows had reiterated their expectation for $10 million in operating cash flow for 2007. The year to date operating cash flow at June 30 was $3.5 million. This leaves at least $6.5 million of operating cash flow for the remaining two quarters. Trading volume has declined since the drop and the stock price has stabilized in a range slightly below the $1.00 mark.  Disclosure: Author has a long position in TCX"

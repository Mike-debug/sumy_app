This transformation to software recurring revenue is intended to reinvigorate sales growth which has stalled and is now negative.I am sure that this is quite frustrating for investors, as other companies in the data management business are experiencing robust sales growth.Last year, Teradata introduced its latest product, the Teradata Vantage Platform which is meant to address the competition head-on:(Source: Teradata)Teradata's data management solutions hold great promise, at least they should in theory, based on a Gartner report that was released this year on data management solutions for analytics. Teradata comes out on top in all four use cases against eighteen other vendors.Yet, the company is having difficulty growing its top line.Part of the problem is with the transformation to SaaS. The recurring revenue is collected over time instead of upfront as with direct sales. This is not unique to Teradata. All companies going through digital transformation experience this phenomenon, and virtually every analyst mistakes this for slowing revenue growth.Even without the change in revenue collection, growth would be anemic at best. One of the reasons for this is that the management has decided to focus only on “Megadata” companies, the market segment that will pay the most for Teradata’s offerings.(Source: Teradata)This means that sales to companies other than Megadata companies are being ignored as the churn is higher and margins are lower. I also believe that Teradata may be charging too much for its products, given the vendor feedback on Teradata's value for money in the Gartner report.In any case, I believe that Teradata’s stock price is quite undervalued, but that is understandable for a company with negative revenue growth. The company has recently hired new executives to jumpstart sales growth. In my opinion, it is best to wait to see some results with the new management in place before jumping on the Teradata bandwagon. There are other companies in data management that are growing leaps and bounds and they may be better investments. For these reasons, I am giving Teradata a neutral rating.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 89 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Teradata is significantly below the trendline, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is much lower than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Teradata is quite undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe. In cases like this, one can usually point to a reason why a stock is undervalued. For Teradata, investors have abandoned this stock due to negative growth in sales for the last three years.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40%,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40% is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40% is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate, plus profit, adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40%:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40% calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin. Others use the operating cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor's perspective.Teradata's revenue grew by negative 6.4% for the most recent 12 months and has been negative for the last three years.(Source: Portfolio123)There are several reasons why revenue is decreasing, including the transformation to SaaS, focus on “Megadata” companies at the expense of other less demanding opportunities, and minimization of consulting activities. Instead of using the negative growth figure for the Rule of 40% calculation, I am going to be somewhat generous and use ARR growth which is 11% YoY.Teradata had a free cash flow margin of 2.7% for the most recent 12-month period. The free cash flow margin has been decreasing steadily since January 2015 when it was a healthy 23%.(Source: Portfolio123)Teradata's YoY ARR growth was 11%, while free cash flow margin was 2.7%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 11% + 2.7% = 13.7%Because the Rule of 40% calculation comes out much significantly lower than 40%, I conclude that the company has a lot of work to make the company financially healthy and bring growth and profits into balance.As an investor, one wants to make sure that if a company doesn't score well on the Rule of 40%, it is at least not burning cash. I am happy to say that Teradata is not burning cash, at least not due to SG&A expense.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)In the case of Teradata, the SG&A expense is 44% of the total revenues which is a reasonable figure and in fact much lower than most SaaS companies. The SG&A expense relative to sales has been rising for a few years but that is because of the transformation and new product development.Another way to look at cash burn is to create a scatter plot that shows the operating margin/EV versus forward sales growth for SaaS stocks. The operating margin for my purposes is calculated as follows:Operating Margin = Gross Margin TTM - SG&A Expense Margin TTM(Source: Portfolio123)Teradata is situated substantially below the trendline, suggesting that the company’s operating margin (gross profit margin - SG&A expense margin) is too low for a company with very little forward sales growth. If forward revenue growth were above 10%, I would consider the operating margin to be acceptable, but not when the forward sales growth is estimated to be less than 3%.According to Gartner report Critical Capabilities for Data Management Solutions for Analytics, Teradata is rated the best by customers in four separate data management use cases. Yes, the company was rated 1st against eighteen other vendors in all four categories.(Source: Gartner)However, in the same Gartner report, it was stated that:I interpret this statement to mean that the customers surveyed agreed that it was the best technology but was too expensive for their application.I have a problem. How is it that the “best” data management and analysis company can’t grow revenue? Consider how Teradata compares to these newcomers in related fields:While most of these companies are not direct competitors of Teradata, they could be if Teradata chose to be in these market niches. These companies are data management vendors, and most are doing extraordinarily well in their target markets.It is clear to me that something is very, very wrong with Teradata. The company supposedly has the best data management products but can’t grow its sales. I believe it is time for a shakeup at the top. In fact, that is already happening. So far this year:It will be some time before we know if these new executives have a tangible influence on Teradata’s Performance. In cases like this, I find that there is usually a ""culture"" problem at the top, and if the top level is not replaced, then the problem remains regardless of how many other changes are made. We will have to wait and see.Teradata is in the process of transforming its business model from hardware sales and perpetual software licenses to SaaS, a move intended to boost revenue. Unfortunately, the opposite is occurring. The company has had negative revenue growth for several years.Teradata scored exceptionally well in the Gartner report that was released this year on data management solutions for analytics. Teradata came out on top for all four use cases against eighteen other vendors.While it is clear that Teradata has exceptional technology, it appears that they are having trouble with marketing and sales. This trouble has resulted in new executives entering the scene, including a new CRO. It will take some time before we know if the new kids on the block have a positive effect on company performance. Until then, I give Teradata a neutral rating."
4286912,104743,2019-08-20T15:48:54-04:00,Annual recurring revenue guidance is too ambitious considering ongoing secular headwinds on subscription transition.The stock traded at a significant premium to low or no-growth software peers on EBITDA and FCF in 2018.New business growth trends which imply diversification into ancillary growth areas would require more time to realize solid earnings.,"Image credit: Company website.Earlier trends in cloud transitions like in the case of Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK) and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) showed both companies started from a position of strength with both vendors experiencing dominant market shares in their relevant sub-industry segments.However, the current transitions in smaller vendors like Teradata Corporation (NYSE:TDC) are not necessarily enjoying the same investor confidence in this respect. Communication during the transition phase plays a vital role especially in guiding investors on recurring revenue growth.I would argue that investors at the minimum need to get sufficient information to be able to keep track of the evolution of a vendor's new subscription strategy. While the overall announcement of a subscription transition makes sense, TDC's communication so far has left many gaps for investors to follow the progress.TDC's subscription story started from a distinct situation than most other vendors. The company is experiencing structural headwinds due to the evolution of the big data industry as an alternative method to store and analyze data.The company originally sells data warehousing appliances (comprised of hardware and software). Income from this product line is recognized in its books as hardware sales and upfront perpetual licenses. Later, TDC began a concerted effort to transition its business model toward subscriptions by selling a hybrid of cloud services, hardware rentals, subscription licenses and managed services.Source: Company data.The growth of the public cloud has expanded the company's competitive intensity. It's a major disruption which created a change event and entry point for competitive vendors within TDC's customers.The company's differentiation strategy has been ever since the ability to process an enormous number of queries on large amounts of data. I must say TDC's performance advantage is notable against transactional-heritage database competitors such as IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). Because of this, TDC has been able to command a higher price for its database software.Competitive pressures will only increase from here. Its biggest rival, Tableau Software (BMV: DATA) remains the market leader in data visualization and the move towards subscription enables it to compete more effectively with its key competitor, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).DATA's journey to a subscription model is occurring faster than expected. Ratable revenue reached a point where the top-line is already building up. Currently, the second leg of the transition is expected to increase margins and operating cash flows. Shares shore up 70% last 2018.Source: Company data.Over the last decade, the ramp in competitive alternatives to TDC has driven declining growth and has pressured pricing. The number of market entrants that are targeted at analytic processing on large amounts of data has grown significantly. Such entrants include Google BigQuery/DataProc, Amazon Redshift/EMR/Athena, The Hadoop ecosystem, Databricks and Snowflake Computing.TDC has guided a 12% annual recurring revenue growth in 2018. Conversely, the analyst consensus estimate is 11% in 2018 and 12% in 2019. Majority of analysts believe that this revenue forecast is too ambitious. It is tough to achieve and unrealistic considering ongoing secular and currency headwinds, along with recent business growth trends.Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is a metric used in SaaS or subscription businesses with Term subscriptions. ARR is the value of the contracted recurring revenue components of the customer's term subscriptions normalized to one year.Source: Barclays ResearchA Goldman Sachs analyst revealed that his estimates of currency and TDC's subscription model transition-adjusted new bookings growth continue to decline in the double digits. However, revenue guidance (as well as analyst consensus estimate) implied a significant reacceleration in new business.At first glance, TDC's business model transition to recurring revenue appears to be accelerating. However, a big portion of this acceleration was caused by currency tailwind. Around 40% of TDC's revenue is generated globally. The two largest contributing regions are the UK and the rest of Eurozone, which underwent a significant currency appreciation between 2017 and 2018.Recurring revenue growth lingers at 7% year-on-year over the last five quarters. Analysts had noted that the shortage of improvement in constant currency revenue growth was the result of sustained declines in new business growth.The chart below illustrates new subscription bookings growth adjusting for the compressive impact of the business model transition and currency. All indicating negative double-digit growth.In 2018, TDC traded at a significant premium to low or no-growth software peers on Earnings Before Income Tax Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and free cash flow (FCF). The stock traded at 11.5X its $450 million FCF while its industry peers traded at 13X. This implies a sustainable mid-single-digit growth is necessary to drive a bigger stock outperformance from these levels.By the first half of 2019, the stock is trading approximately 20X its FCF of approximately $238 million. The stock price has a downside potential of 26%. The ongoing shift to subscriptions and the sales of higher gross margin newer product offerings (such as Teradata Vantage) can drive FCF to a significantly higher level.In my opinion, TDC may still outperform the market only in the near term. It may dispel concerns around the customer spending environment if the macroeconomic environment gets meaningfully stronger. I'm still certain that customer spending will remain strong for finance-related and sales-focused software. But I argue that sales-focused products could only gain importance throughout this year if GDP growth accelerates.The company expects that its ARR this year would increase by 11% to 12%, slightly higher than 2018's guidance of +10% to 12%. Breaking down the reporting segments, recurring revenue is expected to climb by 11% in 2019. Perpetual revenue is expected to be down by approximately $150 million to $200 million. Lastly, consulting revenue is expected to fall by 15% to 20%.For earnings per share (EPS), TDC issued guidance to be $1.45 to $1.55 versus the analyst consensus of $1.58. By the year 2021, the company is targeting to achieve:The company's CFO Mark Culhane is overly optimistic that FCF can get back up to $400 to $500 million by the year 2021. However, actual figures revealed that the company forecasts its FCF to reach only to $270 million by that year. Mr. Culhane said that if TDC could achieve the $400 to $500 million FCF goal at 15X Enterprise Value to FCF multiple ((EV/FCF)), a hypothetical share price of $53/share could be possible.The company admitted that they made mistakes in the past and got complacent due to their large market share. TDC is promising better disclosures and this will be critical to help investors follow this transition better. This is important when considering the long term revenue targets which the company has been announcing in conjunction with its subscription communication.The company normally presents only the following revenue metrics on its guidance announcement:TDC is facing a dilemma that business/pricing model is out of date aside from the fact that TDC is an expensive channel to deal with certain corporate data. I would also argue that the company would sell as an appliance model. The combination of software and bundled hardware resulted in a finished solution for a client. This creates upfront costs at high price points.I would have to say that a more digestible pricing model is truly needed. The transition to a subscription model makes a lot of sense for the company. It allows the company to shift a large portion of capex requirement for a customer to a more manageable operating expenditure line item in its P&L books.The company is re-fueling recurring revenue by introducing a new product Teradata Vantage. More specifically, it can ingest data from anywhere without moving or replicating it, run multiple calculation engines (SQL, machine learning, graph), supports multiple languages (SQL, Python, R, etc.), and runs a consistent protocol across.TDC targets recurring revenue to grow in double digits this year to exhibit momentum on subscription ARR. Although I must say most investors are still cautious as they take a wait and see approach if TDC can continue to perform well in an increasingly competitive market.Earlier, the company guided investors its ARR size of approximately $400 million (doubled from last year). Another impressive yet ambitious revenue figure considering that the change in income model happened only recently.Moreover, sales have not yet been incentivized to sell subscription over perpetual. Thus, this indicates that there is a market demand for TDC on a standalone subscription basis. TDC is focusing on its core market segment comprising the top 500 customers that represent 50% of spend in the market. This customer segment (which is equivalent to a total addressable market of $20 billion) needs a best-in-class closely integrated software solution.However, at this point, I believe it will be tough for the company to sustain its current levels of spend within its customer base, as cloud workloads grow as a percent of the total spend. TDC's significant on-premise performance advantage does not carry over to the cloud. As a result, this would pressure pricing.I recommend a sell with a price target of $32/share. The stock is trading 10.4X EV/EBITDA while EV/Sales hovers at 2.1X.I believe that a mix-shift driven ARR growth has a limited shelf-life and I'm still waiting for evidence that the company's underlying growth or operating leverage has changed. A positive turnaround that would also convince investors to go overweight on TDC shares would be a higher inflection on free cash flow.Operating cash flow significantly missed analyst consensus estimate at $55 million (26% lower vs. analyst consensus) in the second quarter. Subscription bookings were 90% of the total booking.Source: Seeking Alpha.To recap, TDC admitted that they made mistakes in the past and got too complacent. Hence, guidance for recurring revenue growth was lowered while the company now also expects that consulting and perpetual revenue decline to be worse than previously expected. FCF will appear to be worse than expected given higher cash restructuring charges.The company's earnings numbers already suffered even before the announcement of its transition period attributed to structural headwinds that they are already experiencing. Subsequently, the misses on recurring revenue guidance were driven by deal slippage (heavy reliance on large deals) which weighs down on stock performance.I applaud TDC's initiative to shift into subscriptions, as it significantly lowers the price point that customers have to deal with. This pushed the company to increase recurring revenue by changing compensation incentives to strongly favor subscription and by providing its latest product (Teradata Vantage) only via subscription offering.However, I expect that the company's annual recurring revenue growth target for 2019 is still difficult to achieve due to ongoing secular and currency headwinds. Not to mention, new business growth trends which imply diversification into ancillary growth areas will take more time. It will also result in diluted margins in the near term. Competitive threats from new technology and new market entrants will weigh on the shares as well."
4293211,105080,2019-09-24T08:13:39-04:00,"TDC was a top detractor for the quarter, as its shares sold off on mixed first quarter results.While we expect license and consulting revenue declines, as Teradata is transitioning its business model to recurring revenue sales, we are more focused on the company's subscription revenue.We added to our position on weakness during the quarter and Teradata is a core holding in the Fund.","The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter.Teradata: TDC was a top detractor for the quarter, as its shares sold off on mixed first quarter results. Teradata reported solid results on the metrics that we consider most important: annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth of 12% (common currency), higher gross margins, lower operating expenses, and better-than-expected EPS. License and consulting revenues disappointed, however, with larger-than-expected declines of 55% and 22%, respectively. While we expect license and consulting revenue declines, as Teradata is transitioning its business model to recurring revenue sales, we are more focused on the company's subscription revenue. Importantly, management modestly raised its guidance for ARR growth.Teradata, a data warehousing and analytics vendor, historically sold software on a perpetual license basis that ran on proprietary hardware. The company has spent the last few years reconfiguring as a SaaS solution that runs on any hardware customers choose, including private and public cloud. This transition predictably depressed near-term revenue, but TDC is growing its customer base as it is bringing back many former customers that prefer the SaaS model. In the first quarter, despite reporting an overall 7% revenue decline, ARR grew 12%, reaching $1.3 billion, similar to the results experienced during similar transitions that Microsoft and Adobe went through.In addition, as SaaS revenue scales, company operating margins should expand significantly from last year's 2%, to (in a few years) over 20%, approaching its SaaS peers. Also like its SaaS peers, TDC has upfront expenses, but deferred revenue, so the company's free cash flow and margin are better yardsticks for its business success. With expenses front-loaded, TDC's free cash flow margin was only 10% last year, but moving towards 20%, as we believe the company's free cash flow should double in three years. We added to our position on weakness during the quarter and Teradata is a core holding in the Fund.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

In the most recent earnings quarter, the company's subscription-based transactions constituted 66 percent of new bookings, with recurring revenue up 11 percent from the same period last year.Subscription-based revenue is particularly attractive from a financial perspective since this provides more predictability to the timing of cash flow and revenue. Moreover, recurring subscriptions hold the potential to make the company's offerings more profitable over the long term, which also holds appeal from a financial standpointWhen we look at income before taxes, we see that Teradata is now generating a positive income as a percentage of revenue compared to the same period last year:Source: Teradata - 2018 Second Quarter ResultsShould we see this trend continue - i.e. revenue growth starts to directly translate to bottom line growth in income, then it is likely that the stock will rise significantly from the current level.As a capital-intensive business, capital expenditure has thus far been outpacing revenue, but this could be set to change on the back of the company's subscription-based payments model.Moreover, Teradata is positioning itself adequately to capture the growth in the Big Data and Analytics markets. With languages such as Python and R having arguably become the main languages used by data scientists for analysis, Teradata released an Analytics Platform designed for direct support of these languages, rather than having to interact with these through the SQL database language - which was the case with the Aster platform.In this regard, Teradata appears to be positioning itself for significant growth in the analytics space, while concurrently improving its revenue relative to capital expenditure and hence, net income.On this basis, I take a bullish view on Teradata and rate the stock as a buy. In particular, should we see a further increase in net income in the next earnings quarter, along with a higher ratio of revenue to capital expenditure, then this would certainly serve as a bullish signal. With the success of the company's subscription-based model in the past year, this is certainly a possibility going forward.Disclaimer: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

4181894,102994,2018-06-15T11:55:04-04:00,"Big Data-cruncher Cloudera's shares are a big disappointment. They started trading at $18 (April 2017), and rose to $22.40 before falling to a low of $12.60. They trade at $15-16 now.Cloudera's management is trying to sell investors on its pivot toward machine learning/AI, analytics and cloud as well as a more strategic sales strategy with the global 5000.Teradata is a 40-year-old provider of data and analytics products and services that leverage traditional analytics, machine learning, IoT and AI available for on premises, as a service, hybrid, or in the cloud.Teradata's stock was at $28.18 on Cloudera's first trading day. They closed at $41.90 June 13. At Teradata Partners Summit this week, industry analysts said Teradata has its mojo back.While Teradata has seen better days, its pivot to as-a-service, open source, big data and cloud coupled with its loyal customer base may make it a better bet than Cloudera.","While some might see comparing big data unicorn Cloudera (CLDR) with 40-year-old data warehouse and analytics provider Teradata (TDC) as blasphemy, the reality is that both vendors are going after much of the same share of Global 5000 enterprise wallets. More specifically in big data, AI, machine learning and analytics. If you are investing your money in this particular space, you might be better off betting on Teradata than Cloudera. Had you acquired shares in both of them one year ago, you'd be underwater with CLDR and swimming in cash with TDC.Cloudera, which was first to market with a commercial, enterprise-grade version of Apache Hadoop, has tried to disrupt data warehouse leaders like Teradata for nearly a decade, wooing IT managers with cost-effectiveness, scalability and big data crushing powers. Perhaps no one evangelized the benefits of big data and Hadoop as long and as well as Cloudera, but inside companies, actual deployments, or lack thereof, have been big disappointments. IT analyst grader and adviser Gartner analyst Nick Heudecker recently said that as many as 85 percent of Hadoop implementations have resulted in failure. While it may be inaccurate and unfair to suggest that Cloudera's Hadoop offering and ancillary products were involved in most of them, it should be noted that Cloudera has the most Hadoop customers given that it was first to market. The big data vendor hosted the only vendor sponsored user conference, Hadoop World for several years (since at least 2009). And even while some say that technology isn't to blame for Hadoop's failed implementations, the failures show a lack of understanding of what it takes to make it as an enterprise technology provider.While Cloudera, its partners, competitors and customers are building better and more deployable Hadoop and Hadoop-related offerings now, it's a market that isn't winning the lion's share of Cloudera's attention now. That, of course, may be the right way to go, but it's worth asking how many enterprises that Cloudera counts as a ""customer"" have abandoned their Hadoop projects and their relationships with Cloudera. It's also worth considering whether Cloudera is as well received by IT managers and business units who sponsored failing Hadoop-related projects, as a vendor like Teradata which has a large enterprise install base and which IT managers, data workers, business users and the C-Suite have used, trusted and liked for decades.It must be said that Teradata was late to embrace open source, cloud and NoSQL (even though it partnered with Cloudera and other big data vendors,) but it publicly admitted its mistakes at its annual user conference in 2016. It also introduced a data lake management platform Kylo  based on Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache NiFi and contributed it to the Apache Software Foundation in 2007. Teradata has also pivoted to become subscription based and its products are available as a service or on a choice of clouds. The fact that Teradata was able to do change its revenue model, before the world, without having to go private, is exceptional.So while Cloudera-huggers will no doubt be appalled by what I say next, it is worth asking if Teradata isn't already delivering much of what Cloudera aspires to. Moreover, Teradata is already entrenched in many enterprises, has established relationships with IT, data workers and the business community and delivers the security and compliance that business demands.Slide from Teradata's analyst summit this week.Industry analyst Claudia Imhoff tweeted that ""Teradata has its mojo back"" from the event.Gartner also likes what Teradata has to offer as a data management and analytics provider, not only calling it a leader but also giving it the highest ratings as a ""visionary"" of the more than 21 vendors who qualified for the Magic Quadrant.(Above: Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Management and Analytics)So if you are an enterprise buyer of machine learning/AI, analytics solutions based in the cloud, who will you buy from? Cloudera's price may be a differentiator (but Teradata's pricing is becoming more reasonable as a subscription service) as is its reputation as a technology pioneer, but Teradata may be a better bet if you want an actual, actionable return on your investment. While some enterprise investors may want both (Teradata and Cloudera are partners on some solutions), current Teradata customers will likely stay with their existing provider with whom they have an established relationship, who can leverage what is already in place and whose end users will have a more familiar user interface and experience.The best look at the returns that Cloudera Vs. Teradata has offered investors in the past year is the chart at the top of this article. Teradata is up over 40 percent (June 2017-2018) while, for most of this time period, Cloudera investors would have been better off if they had taken their money and put it under the mattress.Both Bert Hochfeld and Gary Alexander have made strong arguments as to why Cloudera might be a buy; a 2.2 market cap, a 4.x revenue multiple on a forward 12-month basis, a huge $73 billion total addressable market (based on data from the IDC), positive and improving cash flows, improving gross margins...see their articles for details. I'm not convinced that any of these matter if Cloudera is overestimating its ability to win business in the highly competitive market it is now after. After all, if it had a head-start over Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP) and MapR in the Hadoop space, and Databricks (a still venture funded cloud provider of Apache Spark based solutions which Cloudera says it commercialized first - I'm not disputing its claim) in the Spark space, and it could not overwhelmingly dominate and delight the majority of customers in those addressable markets, why would the expectations be different in a space that is much more competitive?Teradata, whose financials WG Investment Research and others have discussed at length, is in the process of transitioning to sell its products and services via a new approach - the way that modern enterprise buyers want to consume them (by subscription, in the cloud, and everywhere while leveraging open source) and the numbers indicate that it is working.While TDC's earnings ($0.19 vs. $0.16) and revenues ($506M vs. $497M) were better than expected in Q1 2018, software licenses and hardware revenue were down. The latter may seem to be bad news, but in reality it is digestible given that its recurring revenues (resulting from the new approach) were up 11 percent year-over-year.Moreover, from the analyst presentation, we learned that blue-chip enterprises are already buying into Teradata's IntelliCloud offering.Source: Stephanie McReynolds via TwitterSo it's no wonder that investors are liking Teradata again.I expect this to only get better over the long haul based on what the attendees of the analyst event saw and reported this week.I have heard many good, hopeful arguments as to why Cloudera may make a fantastic investment, but I have yet to see any of them bear fruit. Consider that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) invested in Cloudera at $30.92 in May 2014, and more than four years later it hasn't seen an opportunity to cash out without being underwater.While I admire Cloudera's aspirations and the great lengths it went to educate and comfort investors during its last conference call, at this point it needs to show me that it can deliver something that enterprises are willing to buy, adopt and pay for on a recurring basis.Teradata has turned that corner, the C-Suite is familiar with the company. Its embrace of cloud, open source and new consumption models lead me to believe that it's a better bet given the information available at this time."

        The company also updated its full-year recurring bookings mix to 65-70%, versus a previous outlook of 50-60%.
        A greater mix of recurring revenues may justify a multiple expansion for Teradata, which has traded at a discounted multiple for quite awhile.
        Big data stocks trade at a discount to most SaaS peers despite their growing importance in enterprise technology, most notably Teradata at a <2x forward revenue multiple.","Evaluating a business that's in the midst of a major transition is like chasing a moving target - depending on the pace of that transition, results can be all over the place and a bona fide assessment is difficult to make. Last quarter, while acknowledging that Teradata was an incredibly cheap stock, I noted that Teradata's transition to a cloud-subscription model was inducing weak results in the near term that investors should be cautious about.This quarter, Teradata (TDC) surprised Wall Street with results that tilted heavily toward the upside. Most notably of all, the company accelerated the pace of its transition toward recurring subscription revenues - an event that, for many companies, has produced tremendous stock price growth (such as at Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK)). Yet in light of a quickened transition pace, Teradata's near-term Q2 results didn't look too bad.Note that, at least in the current quarter and at least the next few quarters, an accelerated transition is a headwind for results on both the revenue and cost side. This is due to the fact that when Teradata defers more revenues over time through subscription deals, less revenue is recognized upfront. And what's more, the proportion of revenue that is recognized upfront tilts more heavily toward hardware, which carries substantially lower margins than software. In spite of these headwinds, however, Teradata managed beats to both top and bottom line estimates in Q2 that minimized the impact of this cloud transition. Like Tableau's results earlier last week (a company that's also undergoing its own cloud transition), it appears that Teradata is managing well through its subscription shift. I'm encouraged by Teradata's Q2 results, and the fact that it was poorly received by investors may be a buying opportunity for the stock. Note that Teradata has traded at an incredibly low valuation multiple for years. Though the company is no longer a growth stock, the <2x revenue multiple at which it's currently trading is a stark contrast to the majority of SaaS companies that are trading at 7-10x forward revenues. It makes sense to apply a lower valuation to Teradata's revenue stream when the majority of it was low-margin, perpetual revenues. But with the company's revenue mix tilting heavily in favor of subscription revenues, the huge discount is no longer justified. Alongside its Q2 earnings release, Teradata released new guidance that called for an FY18 bookings mix that would consist of 65-70% recurring subscriptions. Previously, the company had guided to a 50-60% mix - but recognizing the strength in the 66% bookings mix in Q2 and extrapolating that trend forward, the company has upped that guidance range, effectively implying an acceleration of Teradata's cloud transition. This had a near-term impact on revenue guidance - the company took down its FY18 revenue target to $2.13-$2.15 billion, down from a previous range of $2.15-$2.18 billion, but this is no reason to be sour on Teradata. The faster the company can move to 80-90% subscription bookings, the faster the near-term earnings pain can subside. Note that Teradata isn't alone among the big data IaaS stocks that are facing pressure. Cloudera (CLDR), most notably, has been pressured ever since its Q4 release predicted a souring of its revenue retention rate and a corresponding deceleration of growth below <30%. Still, its current valuation multiple at 3.4x also stands in stark contrast to the wider SaaS sector, even among peers at a similar high 20s/low 30s growth rate. Fellow enterprise Hadoop vendor Hortonworks (HDP) is also in the same boat.Thematically speaking, this pessimism toward the big data space is unsettling. More and more, enterprises are treating their data as a real and critical asset, and data management tools like Teradata and Cloudera are necessary components of this ecosystem. In my view, investors have a tremendous opportunity to buy into these stocks now while they're still cheap.Here's a glance at Teradata's Q2 results:Figure 1. Teradata Q2 earningsSource: Teradata investor relationsThe company achieved radically improved Q2 results compared to the Q1 print, hence my reversal in opinion toward the stock. Revenues grew 6% y/y to $544 million, doubling the 3% y/y growth rate Teradata experienced in Q1. Wall Street wasn't expecting it - consensus estimates pinned Teradata's Q2 revenue at $524.3 million (+2% y/y), marking a four-point beat this quarter. It's fairly common for a company that's growing at 30 or 40% to beat Wall Street estimates by a four-point margin, but when a four-point beat like Teradata's implies a growth rate that doubled consensus expectations, it's a truly remarkable feat.Again, I'll emphasize that this revenue strength came in spite of a faster cloud transition. Subscription bookings (note that bookings isn't necessarily revenue recognized in the quarter) clocked in at a 66% mix of the total, ahead of the company's expectation of 50-60%. This means more revenues were deferred to future quarters than the company had expected when it was issuing its Q2 guidance. Total recurring revenue in the quarter grew 11% y/y to $312 million, representing a 57% mix of the total versus 55% in the year-ago quarter. Here's what Victor Lund, Teradata's CEO, had to say on the subscription transition:Note also that, in spite of the accelerated subscription transition, Teradata's operating profit no longer compressed as it did last quarter. Gross margin, for starters, fell only 120bps from the year-ago quarter, versus 170bps in Q1.Furthermore, the company managed to hold operating expenses relatively flat, producing an operating profit of $10 million (1.8% GAAP operating margin), versus breakeven in the year-ago quarter. Last quarter, it had been the other way around - the company turned breakeven profits in 1Q17 into a small loss in 1Q18.Pro forma EPS of $0.26 showed a tremendous beat as well over Wall Street expectations of $0.19. And perhaps most relieving of all is the fact that Teradata's free cash flow no longer showed the plunge this quarter as it did in Q1, with Q2 FCF growing 60% y/y to $72 million:Figure 2. Teradata FCFSource: Teradata investor relationsRecall that in Q1, one of the most alarming data points was the fact that Teradata showed a -32% y/y compression in free cash flow. In the year-to-date, FCF is still down by -18% y/y, but that's a much easier number to swallow in light of the increased amount of revenues that are being deferred. Teradata's first-half FCF margin of 22% is also highly competitive with the rest of the software sector.With its Q2 results, Teradata has provided relief from the worrying print in Q1, particularly on the FCF and margin compression front. The company continues to make progress toward its cloud transition ahead of expectations, and near-term earnings don't look that bad in spite of that fact. So long as the strength in Teradata's Q2 print continues, Teradata's bargain-basement valuation multiple bears tremendous opportunities for investors to nab a piece of the nascent big data sector."
4183661,103480,2018-06-25T06:05:12-04:00,"Teradata shares have surged back this year on optimism for the company's shift into cloud subscriptions.In the near term, however, the shift has stunted growth and crimped the company's margins.Free cash flow was one of the cornerstones for investing in Teradata; in the company's most recent Q1 results, FCF declined drastically.While subscription transitions have worked out for many companies like Adobe, Teradata is already a legacy technology brand that may not have that much staying power left.","By now, almost all of the old ""legacy"" software companies have embraced the trend of cloud computing and recognized that the shift to SaaS is inevitable. Even the most old-school technology companies that have relied on bulky, expensive on-prem license deals like Tableau (DATA) have begun shifting their focus on online, hosted offerings. Teradata (TDC), a data warehousing and analytics company that offers tangential services to Tableau, is no different.Earlier in the year, Teradata stock was down in the dumps. It was lumped in with a slew of other legacy software companies like Oracle (ORCL) that were deemed to be going the way of IBM (IBM). Since then, however, Teradata stock has rebounded sharply on positive hopes for the company's cloud transition.The positive energy surrounding a SaaS transition is not unprecedented. A few years back, investors were questioning whether Adobe (ADBE), which in the past relied on license sales of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Photoshop (in earlier years, these licenses were sold on actual disks), would have a future. Flash forward to today, and Adobe's revenue is almost nearly all subscription-based - and the stock, correspondingly, is one of the best performers of the SaaS sector.Investors have the same optimism for Teradata, evidently. Shares are up nearly 40% over the past year. Yet at a valuation of just 2.1x forward revenues, the company still appears cheap. However, I'd caution investors against betting on Teradata. Earlier in the year, I was positive on Teradata due to its strong free cash flows in FY17 and a cheap valuation multiple on a forward free cash flow basis. With Teradata's Q1 earnings release in early May, however, the company has shown that it is incapable of transitioning to the cloud without seeing a near-term contraction in margins and cash flow.This is to be expected, of course. Moving from license sales to subscription sales that are recognized over time will impact revenue generation and cash collection in the near term, as well as pressure margins. Adobe experienced the same thing and emerged a stronger company; Autodesk (ADSK) is undergoing this shift right now and investors are betting on its success. But can Teradata afford the time and risk that this long-drawn transition entails? Adobe and Autodesk are the unquestioned giants in their space - regardless of sales delivery model, there are few replacements to Acrobat or AutoCADS. Conversely, in recent years, Teradata has been under pressure from both nimbler cloud startups as well as large-cap software giants. Teradata's recent lawsuit against SAP (SAP) for infringing on ""trade secrets"", no matter how legitimate the claim, reinforces how threatened Teradata feels on the competitive front.In other words, Teradata might not have the time to fully transition into the cloud without becoming irrelevant first. In Teradata's defense, leading industry research firm Gartner still placed it on the Leaders quadrant of its 2018 ranking of data management solutions vendors, but Teradata has lost footing against Oracle, Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon AWS (AMZN). It's worth noting that, while they occupy a lower tier in the rankings, IBM (IBM) and SAP are also featured as Leaders in the ranking.A technology company need not be brand new and exciting to make for a good investment. The embattled database company Oracle, in fact, is one of my largest positions. But in Teradata's case, investors were relying on its strong free cash flows amid mid-single-digit revenue growth to support the bullish thesis. If Teradata is going to start showing negative y/y revenue comps amid declining free cash flows, and place the blame on the cloud transition, then there might not be much of a bullish case left.Here's a look at the company's most recent quarterly results:Figure 1. Teradata Q1 resultsSource: Teradata investor relationsRevenues were essentially flat, growing just 3% y/y to $506 million. This just barely slid past analysts' estimates of $496 million (+1% y/y) in the quarter. Though growth was small, revenue growth was certainly the most positive data point coming out of the quarter. Teradata exited Q4 with a flat y/y growth rate, so the fact that the company was able to drive a few points of growth even after accounting for the cloud transition is commendable. The company did disclose, however, that positive foreign currency effects were responsible for the revenue growth this quarter; on a constant currency basis, revenue growth would have been -1% y/y.It's worth noting as well that recurring revenues shoed double-digit growth at 11% y/y, or 7% y/y on a constant currency basis. Recurring revenues are now 60% of Teradata's revenue base, up four points from the prior year's 56%. For comparison, Adobe and other companies that have fully shifted to a cloud-based model now typically see recurring mixes around 90%. This, however, is where the positives in the quarter end. The cloud transition doesn't come free - in fact, it has caused some damage to margins. Gross profit margin on a GAAP basis dipped 170bps to 44.1%, hampered by lower gross margins in the cloud. Here's what Teradata's management had to say on the gross margin compression in the quarterly earnings call, noting that the margins quoted are on a pro forma basis:Due largely to this margin compression, the company ended the quarter at just about breakeven net income, unchanged from the prior year's Q1. Where the pain was really felt, was on the free cash flow side:Figure 2. Teradata FCFSource: Teradata free cash flowOn one hand, Teradata's free cash flow compression is understandable. On a cloud-based model, cash billings are accrued and received over time, and paid upfront. On the company's earnings press release, Teradata noted a similar effect:However, the -32% y/y decline in free cash flows is noticeably painful. It's true that in the longer-term, a cloud transition may benefit Teradata as its customers pay more over time, but when investors are relying on the company's FCF margins to support its valuation and bull run, it's not pretty to see. We are likely to see further compressions in margins and free cash flow as Teradata continues to advance its cloud transition.In my view, it's difficult to take a longer-term view on Teradata and put faith in its cloud transition when its technology leadership is questionable and its position in the market keeps getting outpaced by much larger, well-funded competitors. Teradata is in a convenient position of being able to blame its cloud transition for any y/y declines in revenues or margin compression, but investors will be hard-pressed to tell how much of Teradata's contraction is due to the cloud transition versus a bona fide business slowdown.Though Teradata appears cheap at a 2.1x forward revenue valuation, the company's stock is floating on air without the free cash flows to support it. I would take advantage of the fact that the stock is trading near all-time highs to lock in gains."

A combination of falling core earnings and economic earnings, low ROIC, and an overvalued stock price land Teradata Corporation (TDC) in the Danger Zone.From 2015-TTM, TDC’s GAAP net income improved from -$214 million to $14 million. Meanwhile, core earnings, which exclude unusual gains and losses, fell from $233 million to $23 million over the same time, per Figure 1.Figure 1: TDC’s GAAP Net Income Vs. Core EarningsIn prior years, TDC’s GAAP net income actually understated its core earnings due to non-recurring expenses included in reported earnings, such as:This understatement in prior years creates the illusion of improved profits in the current period. Investors who don't have time to read financial footnotes are more likely to be misled by these non-recurring items. In reality, core earnings are in a long-term decline.TDC would rather investors focus on flawed non-GAAP metrics such as non-GAAP net income. On page 27 (Section 4.1) of a recent Harvard Business School and MIT Sloan paper, experts show that “Street Earnings are not only an incomplete reflection of firms’ non-operating earnings but also reflect managerial biases.” If you think non-GAAP metrics are any better, you’re mistaken.The most common and often largest item TDC removes to calculate non-GAAP net income is stock-based compensation expense. In 2018, TDC removed $66 million (42% of non-GAAP net income) in stock-based compensation.Per Figure 2 TDC’s TTM non-GAAP net income of $154 million is well above GAAP net income of $14 million. Economic earnings, which account for the non-recurring items noted earlier, as well as changes to the balance sheet, are even lower at -$64 million.Figure 2: TDC’s Non-GAAP Net Income is MisleadingTDC faces significant competition in the data analytics and visualization market and has yet to prove it can successfully transition to a software-as-a-service model in a way that creates shareholder value.TDC’s net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) margins have fallen from 14% in 2014 to 2% TTM. Over the same time, the cap-weighted average of the publicly traded peers listed in TDC’s proxy statement[1], has improved from 5% to 8%. See Figure 3.Figure 3: TDC’s NOPAT Margin Vs. PeersTDC’s capital efficiency also is declining. Since 2014, TDC’s invested capital turns, which represent the level of revenue generated per dollar of invested capital, have declined from 1.81 to 1.38. The market cap weighted average of the peers mentioned above improved from 1.52 to 2.37 over the same time.Figure 4: TDC’s Invested Capital Turns Vs. PeersThe combination of margin contraction and deteriorating capital efficiency drives TDC’s return on invested capital (ROIC) below its peers. Per Figure 5, TDC once earned a significantly higher ROIC than its peers. However, its ROIC has fallen from 26% in 2014 to just 2% TTM. Meanwhile, the market cap weighted peer average has improved from 7% to 9% over the same time.Figure 5: TDC’s ROIC Vs. PeersBulls will argue that Teradata’s fundamental weakness is simply the temporary result of the firm’s transition from a perpetual software license and hardware business model to a recurring revenue, software-as-a-service model. Unfortunately, these arguments ignore the deterioration in the business that occurred even before this transition.Revenue Decline Began Before Transition: Teradata announced its business transformation in the fourth quarter of 2015. This transformation was supposed to reduce the company’s cost structure, focus on the core data and analytics business, and modify the company’s go-to-market approach.However, as Figure 6 shows, the deterioration in profits began well before this transformation was announced. From 2012-2015, NOPAT declined 18% compounded annually, margins fell from 16% to 9%, and ROIC declined from 33% to 14%. To buy into the argument that the transformation alone is causing the weakness in recent years, one must ignore the deterioration in years prior.Figure 6: TDC’s NOPAT Decline Before and After Business TransformationNot Achieving Any Cost Benefits During Transition: Teradata’s business transformation was supposed to reduce its cost structure, but it has to show results. If the company is foregoing higher perpetual license and hardware revenue in an effort to build a steady stream of (lower) recurring revenue, it must lower costs (and increase margins) to make up the difference. However, Teradata’s costs, some of which are down in pure dollar value, have actually increased as a percent of revenue.TDC’s selling, general, and administrative expenses rose from 29% of revenue in 2016 to 32% TTM. Its research and development expenses rose from 9% of revenue in 2016 to 16% TTM. The cost of recurring revenue increased from 12% of revenue in 2016 to 21% TTM. Overall, total operating expenses have grown from 41% of revenue in 2016 to 48% TTM.TDC is not achieving the economies of scale to lower costs at an equal or faster pace than falling revenue.Figure 7: TDC’s Costs Are RisingCEO Change Represents More of the Same: In May 2016, Teradata appointed Victor Lund as CEO to help “realize the benefits of the transformation, build on the company’s strengths, drive long-term growth, and increase shareholder value.” However, as the company’s fundamentals continued to deteriorate, TDC promoted Oliver Ratzesberger to CEO in January 2019 and Mr. Lund moved into the chairman of the board position.In November 2019, TDC announced Mr. Ratzesberger resigned, with TTM results worse off than 2018. Mr. Lund resumed his former position as CEO. Multiple CEO changes in a four-year span don’t create confidence in the firm’s ability to execute, especially when the company is shuffling back and forth between the same people.Great Product, Not Creating Value for Users: Despite the issues above, we’re not here to make the claim that Teradata fails to provide a good product for its customers. In Gartner’s report on Data Management Solutions for Analytics firms, Teradata ranked highest among competitors in four separate use cases.However, simply providing a good product is half the battle in an industry where customers have multiple options. A firm also must provide its products at attractive prices, whereby customers believe they’re getting good value for the cost. In the same report linked above, Gartner noted that Teradata had “the lowest relative survey score in the impression of value for the money spent.”Customers already believing they’re not getting good value for the money being spent makes it increasingly unlikely that TDC could raise prices in an effort to improve margins. However, TDC must improve margins to meet the expectations baked into the stock price, as we’ll show below.In 2019, the market saw some of TDC’s overvaluation as the stock fell 29% in 2019. However, even at its lower price, TDC still holds significant downside risk and remains very expensive. Below we’ll use our reverse DCF model to quantify the future cash flow expectations baked into the current stock price.To justify its current price, TDC must achieve 7% NOPAT margins (peer average in 2018, compared to 2% TTM) and grow NOPAT by 13% compounded annually for the next 13 years. See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario. This expectation seems overly optimistic given TDC’s margins have fallen in each of the last two years and its TTM NOPAT declined by nearly 60% over the prior TTM period. Figure 8 illustrates the implied NOPAT growth in this scenario compared to the firm’s NOPAT decline historically.Figure 8: TDC’s Implied NOPAT Growth is Overly OptimisticEven if TDC can more than triple current margins to 6% (would be best since 2016) and grow NOPAT by 11% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth just $17/share today – a 26% downside. See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario.Each of these scenarios also assumes TDC is able to grow revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations embedded in the current valuation are.Often the largest risk to any bear thesis is what we call “stupid money risk,” which means an acquirer comes in and pays for TDC at the current, or higher, share price despite the stock being overvalued. Many of the largest competitors in the industry, given their vast resources, could see an acquisition as a quick path to updating their product portfolio. However, given the low profitability, a product providing low value relative to its costs, and an overvalued stock price, we think it would be unwise for a larger firm to acquire TDC at current levels.However, we think it helps to quantify what, if any, acquisition hopes are priced into the stock.First, investors need to know that Teradata has large (hidden) liabilities that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers would initially suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities, we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. For this analysis, we chose Oracle (ORCL) as a plausible acquirer of TDC, but analysts can use just about any company to do the same research. The key differences are the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and ROIC for assessing different hurdle rates for a deal to create value.Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, TDC is worth less than its current share price.Figures 9 and 10 show what we think ORCL should pay for TDC to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. There are limits on how much ORCL would pay for TDC to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows being acquired.Each implied price is based on a ""goal ROIC"" assuming different levels of revenue growth. In both scenarios, the estimated revenue growth rate is -13% in year one and +1% in year two, which are the consensus estimates for TDC’s revenue growth. For the subsequent years, we use 1% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of consensus estimates. We use 8% in scenario two because it assumes TDC could grow faster with the large support, resources, and customer base of Oracle.We conservatively assume that ORCL can grow TDC’s revenue and NOPAT without spending any working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price. We also assume TDC stops its margin decline and achieves an 8% NOPAT margin (TTM average of peer group above).Figure 9: Implied Acquisition Prices for Value-Neutral DealFigure 9 shows the ""goal ROIC"" for ORCL as its WACC, or 6%. This scenario represents the minimum level of performance required to not destroy value. Even if TDC can grow revenue by consensus estimates in years 1-2 and 8% compounded annually in years 3-5, the firm is worth less than its current price. It’s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 6% ROIC would not be accretive, as the return on the deal would equal ORCL’s WACC.Figure 10: Implied Acquisition Prices to Create ValueFigure 10 shows the next ""goal ROIC"" of 20%, which is ORCL’s current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to ORCL shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the implied stock value is significantly less than the current price. Any scenario assuming less revenue growth would result in further capital destruction.TDC has missed earnings and/or revenue expectations in each of the last two quarters. In the most recent quarter (3Q19), the stock dropped more than 18% in one day as earnings missed and guidance came in well below expectations. In 2Q19, when TDC’s earnings were in-line, and revenue below expectations, the stock dropped 8% in one day.As costs continue to increase as a percent of sales, and sales continue their multi-year decline, similar price movement could occur if TDC misses earnings again or reports recurring revenue growth below expectations. The company’s transformation is many years in the making, with little to show for it. As patience runs thin, the odds of the stock dropping to more reasonable levels increase. Another miss on earnings could push investors to sell as they’re forced to face the reality of TDC’s deteriorating business.In general, markets aren’t good at identifying value-destroying companies that waste shareholder capital. Instead, due to the proliferation of noise traders, markets are more likely to pump up popular momentum stocks, while undervaluing high-quality unconflicted and comprehensive fundamental research. Here’s a quick summary for what noise traders miss when analyzing TDC:TDC’s executives may not care about the deteriorating fundamentals because their compensation is tied to metrics that don’t measure them accurately. In 2018, annual bonuses were tied to target GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income goals. As with non-GAAP net income above, non-GAAP operating income excludes real costs of doing business, such as stock-based compensation expense, and acquisition, integration, and reorganization costs. Now, that we have proof from HBS & MIT Sloan that managers manipulate their numbers, we wonder why the TDC board of directors allows these kinds of metrics to determine executive pay.In 2018, long-term equity awards, of which 70% are performance based, were tied to target annual recurring revenue growth levels and percent of subscription-based product booking goals. Each of these target goals focuses executives on top-line growth, while ignoring costs. In 2019, these performance based equity awards will be tied to annual recurring revenue growth levels and free cash flow as a percent of revenue.As long as TDC continues to use these flawed metrics, its executives will be incentivized to boost their growth numbers with no attention to the underlying fundamentals of the business. Instead of incentivizing executives with non-GAAP and revenue goals, we’d recommend the firm’s compensation committee tie pay to ROIC, which is directly correlated with creating shareholder value.During the past 12 months, 699,000 insider shares have been purchased and 143,000 have been sold for a net effect of 556,000 insider shares purchased. These sales make up <1% of shares outstanding.Short interest currently is 12.5 million shares, which equates to 11% of shares outstanding and just over nine days to cover. Short interest is up 4% from the prior month as the firm’s fundamentals deteriorate and the stock remains overvalued.As investors focus more on fundamental research, research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings.Below are specifics on the adjustments we make based on Robo-Analyst findings in Teradata’s 2018 10-K:Income Statement: We made $89 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $24 million in non-operating expense (1% of revenue). We removed $56 million related to non-operating expenses and $33 million related to non-operating income. You can see all the adjustments made to TDC’s income statement here.Balance Sheet: We made $1.5 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of $105 million. The most notable adjustment was $566 million (42% of reported net assets) in asset write-downs. You can see all the adjustments made to TDC’s balance sheet here.Valuation: We made $1.2 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $358 million. The largest adjustment to shareholder value was $658 million in total debt, which includes $65 million in operating leases. This lease adjustment represents 2% of TDC’s market value.

The company helps customers better manage their data and analytics, in addition to assisting in extracting value out of big data (watch this video to learn more about Teradata's business). This sounds like a company that should be doing well in today's environment, right? Teradata's stock has indeed performed well lately (up ~40% over the last year) but TDC shares have significantly underperformed the broader market over the last three years.TDC data by YChartsThe underperformance was caused by several factors, but I believe that the largest factor was related to management's failure to see the need to pivot and transition Teradata into a subscription-based company several years ago. Better late than never.The impressive stock performance over the last year has been nice, of course, if you have been a shareholder, but I believe that Teradata is still a long-term buy today because the shift in business model will create a tremendous amount of shareholder value in the years ahead.It is hard to deny the fact that data is (and has been) driving the global economy, and the momentum does not appear to be slowing down anytime soon.

Therefore, the need to manage and interpret/analyze big data will continue to be a critical function for almost every company, so the services of data-driven companies like Teradata are needed now more than ever.The digital megatrend is creating a significant market opportunity for Teradata and, if management is successful in achieving its long-term strategic objectives, TDC shareholders will be big winners in the years ahead.Source: Teradata's Q4 2017 Earnings PresentationIn my opinion, Teradata is in a great position to capitalize on the transition to more of a data-driven global economy, but the company's long-term success will definitely come down to management being able to navigate Teradata through the ever-changing landscape, which means that there are risks to the story.On May 3, 2018, Teradata reported better-than-expected earnings ($0.19 vs. $0.16) and revenue ($506M vs. $497M) but management's full-year guidance spooked the market (shares finished the trading day down ~6%). For comparison purposes, the company reported adjusted EPS of $0.28 on revenue of $491M in the same period of the prior year.Source: Q1 2018 Earnings PresentationAs shown in the table, the company's software licenses and hardware revenue was down big again but the business that matters (i.e., recurring revenue) was up 11% YoY. These operating results show that management continues to be successful in shifting Teradata's business model to the more predictable, recurring revenue instead of being focused on perpetual licenses. This transition, however, does come at a cost as the company's operating results were again 'negatively' impacted by a higher mix of subscription business.And it is this higher mix of subscription business that caused management to lower its full-year 2018 guidance:The shift to a subscription-based model is causing headwinds as it continues to negatively impact Teradata's operating results, but in my opinion, it is the right decision to make. The recurring revenue model will allow management to better manage its business and, in my opinion, the more predictable revenue will eventually win over the market.A full list of risk factors can be found at the company's 2017 10-K. The biggest risk with investing in Teradata, in my opinion, is related to the company not differentiating itself from other competitors. There are plenty of data-driven companies competing for the IT consulting dollars, so Teradata needs to continue to show its worth, especially in today's environment.Simply put, Teradata's risk-reward profile is very attractive if you are willing (and able) to hold onto shares for the next three-to-five years. I believe that management made the right decision when it shifted the focus to more of a subscription-based model, so at some point, the current headwinds will turn into long-term tailwinds. As such, long-term minded shareholders would be wise to at least add Teradata to their watch list because there is a lot to like about this small data-driven company in today's environment.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4123386,98236,2017-11-10T13:22:23-05:00,"Teradata reoported its results late last week.The company's quarter featured noticeable beats in terms of revenues, and earnings as well as an increased forecast for Q4.The company's preliminary forecast for 2018 indicated results well above prior consensus levels.While the shares responded positively to the strong quarter, their valuation remains very compressed and does not reflect the potential for future growth.Most third party market researchers continue to rate Teradata's offerings as the best in its market segment, which itself is large and rapidly growing.","One of my pet peeves about earnings season is that it is…well a season and lots of companies report in a very short time and investors are compelled to evaluate lots of information without either the time or the details with which to make informed judgements. Investors, on average, have far more interest in the results of a Shopify (SHOP) or Microsoft (MSFT) than they do regarding the results of a little known and not well-respected name such as a Teradata (TDC). And yet, the appreciation potential for TDC shares is likely to be at least as substantial the former two names-just because it is currently little known and less respected as a company. At some level, finding these neglected and disrespected businesses that have been left as road kill by most analysts and investors is how I try to make part of my living. Owning momentum growth names such as Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) has been a profitable strategy this past year and requires far less effort than attempting to shine some light in a dusty quarter. The QQQ is up by 20% YTD which represents a challenging hurdle for stock pickers. Perhaps of more significance, the IGV tech/software index has risen by 42%, far more than the 18% appreciation of TDC shares over the same time period. Will those trends continue? Will that kind of relative performance persist? I am inclined to doubt either one is likely to be the case over the coming year-although I still hold my Amazon shares. I think it is worth looking at the operational performance of Teradata this past quarter to determine if the gap between its share price performance, and the performance of the IGV index, in particular, has been justified and if it has the potential to achieve better performance on a relative basis in the coming quarters. Needless to say, I think the latter is likely-else I wouldn’t be writing this article and wasting key strokes and electrons. But trying to find undiscovered and unloved corners of the IT firmament has become an increasingly difficult undertaking and one that requires investors to cast their nets further afield.Investors are right to want to invest in the big data/analytics space. It continues to grow at rates substantially greater than IT as a whole and given the breadth of use cases that enterprises have been deploying, that trend seems likely to continue for years to come. But it is not terribly easy to find an investment vehicle that is totally attuned to the space and which is likely to benefit explicitly from the trends in the market. I certainly do not think that companies in the data visualization space such as Tableau (DATA) are really likely to be long-term beneficiaries. Companies riding the Hadoop wave such as Hortonworks (HDP) and Cloudera (CLDR) continue to grow rapidly, but their path to profitability is long and rocky.And then there is Teradata, a company that in some ways has been a big data pioneer. The company was poised to do excellent things but simply lost its way under its former CEO who was replaced in a sort of “hail Mary” for the company’s independent survival by Vic Lund about 18 months ago. It has been an interesting journey so far, if not a terribly profitable one for the shares. But the last quarter or two suggest that the opportunities inherent in this company’s technology and its installed base are on the cusp of realization.Teradata reported its results for Q3 on last week. The results were better than expectations in terms of reported EPS, revenues and growth of product ARR. Guidance was increased as well because of the strength of the pipeline. Specifically, the company reported revenues of $526 million which was about 3% above the prior consensus with EPS of $0.29, an $.08 beat although some of that was based on the timing of tax obligations (excluding that factor, EPS was $.03 above the prior consensus). In terms of revenue performance, the most important number to consider I believe, was the growth of product ARR which reached 23%. Recurring product revenue increased by 9% sequentially. This trend is not yet visible in the deferred revenue metric as most deferred revenues are still generated by annual maintenance contract billings. The company forecast for its Q4 was increased modestly, by about 1%-2%. The company is seeing a rapid and substantial transition to subscription-based consumption offerings The CFO indicated that the company's large deal pipeline was significantly skewed with most transactions likely to be based on some kind of subscription pricing. As a result, it is forecasting product ARR growth in the mid 20% range. That is a significant number and suggests that the company has been able to sell an increasing volume of deals with consumption models new to Teradata. The company’s EPS forecast looks like a guide-down but that is a function of the aforementioned timing of tax obligations. At the mid-point, and adjusted for the timing of tax recognition, TDC increased its EPS expectation by $.01.I might point out that Teradata uses a relatively modest level of stock based comp, net of tax provisions, and has no amortization or acquisition related expenses to report either. While logically, this ought to be a factor in evaluating the company’s performance and its valuation, that is not likely to be the case. Investors have their preferences when it comes to such things and the absence of stock based comp simply isn’t valued to any great extent.The company’s transition is weighing noticeably on its P&L which is typical of companies moving their revenues to a subscription model. This company continues to sell some hardware in conjunction with its software offerings so the transition to a ratable model inevitably has and will take a toll on reported gross margins. Last quarter, the company saw its gross margins decline by almost 600 basis points on a GAAP basis, although they increased at a marginal rate sequentially. The company will need to be much further along in its transition to ratable revenue sources before it is likely that it will be able to improve its expense ratios on a consistent basis.Part of the decline in gross margins relates to service performance which saw a decrease of more than 500 basis points, mainly a function of the company’s consulting practice. The company's consulting practice is also in the midst of a transition which has lead to longer and more complex assignments and stretched revenue recognition. The consulting initiatives are part of the company's marketing effort and a necessary component of the company's strategy to reignite growth and to differentiate what it offers. The results of the company's consulting business in Q3 was a continuation of trends forecast over the past year although the company is now forecasting some improvement in Q4 in this segment in Q4 based on revenue recognition from milestone attainments of larger contracts.The company had a noticeable increase in GAAP operating expense which rose by about 20% year on year. GAAP operating expenses actually fell a bit sequentially but they will remain at elevated levels as a ratio, I imagine, for the foreseeable future. This trend is also a product of the transition of the company to a ratable revenue model coupled with initiatives to broaden the product footprint and to provide users with additional functionality. GAAP research and development cost actually increased by 78% year on year although the sequential increase in research and development spend was just 5%. Selling, general and administrative expense was down by 3% year on year, with the selling component rising and the general and administrative component falling.Teradata, reversing many years of being a closed environment now allows its users to work with their preferred analytic tool and across data sources with the best capability, elasticity and performance for their specific use case. It is probably a bigger deal in terms of appealing to users than it might seem. But these initiatives are taking a toll on reported EPS and while the company will likely improve its optics in 2018, the larger payoff is probably still a few quarters down the road.The company has offered a preliminary outlook for 2018. It expects to return to reported growth in terms of revenues, EPS and free cash flow. The only specific quantitative number that was offered in this guide was product ARR which is expected to grow in the low 20% range. That is actually a number consistent with metrics from companies that are far more highly valued than TDC, but which have much better optics. For investors looking at growth more than optics, low 20% ARR growth is a very healthy number to consider.The company forecast that EPS growth would be more than 10% and as it happens that is a significantly greater increase than the current consensus. The company did not discuss just how much greater than 10% growth it expected for EPS and I suppose that is not terribly surprising. Essentially, TDC has now forecast EPS expectations that will be in the range of $1.40-$1.45 at a minimum, compared to the current published First Call consensus of $1.28.Handicapping turnarounds is always a difficult undertaking. There are many things that can and often do go wrong. Teradata has been a tired company with an inflexible and possibly obsolescent set of offerings. The company seemingly lacked vision and was clearly not being effectively run. It can always be difficult to turn that around.Teradata is one of the lowest rated stocks in my coverage universe and presumably those ratings reflect analyst disbelief that a turnaround can be successfully engineered. It is one of the reasons why the company has such major potential share price appreciation. The key is not likely to be this company’s business model or its cost structure. The key is going to be whether this company can retain and solidify its competitive positioning in its space and enjoy the kind of growth commensurate with the expansion of analytic and big data use cases.Teradata’s major competitors at this point include IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP), SAS Institute and Microsoft (MSFT). AWS (AMZN) offers a solution in the space. I have linked here to the latest Gartner study of competition. As has been the case for many years at this point, Teradata is most highly ranked. I do not necessarily agree with everything that Gartner writes. Still, it might be worthwhile considering some of its commentary about TDC’s competitive positioning: “Teradata has built a DMSA platform that addresses all use cases…Teradata’s ability to integrate with multiple data sources including Hadoop and streaming data, to provide a unified query interface and to deploy in multiple environments such as appliances, software and the cloud, demonstrate its market leadership in product capabilities and a strong vision for the future.” According to Gartner, ""Nearly 80% of Teradata’s reference customers consider it to be the standard DMSA (data management solutions for analytics). “Teradata’s reference customer scores for performance across a broad range of use cases, were among the best of all the vendors in this Magic Quadrant.”These days TDC is actually the bargain of the query world. From the CEO script on the last conference call transcript-but not necessarily invalid, nonetheless, “The other guys can’t come close to the cost per query from Teradata. This is the real measure of value of data, how much work can be done in a given amount of time? We ran a benchmark on one million real-world queries, and the cost per query from TDC was less than $60 versus more than $600 for the leading cloud database.” I have no reason to disbelieve the number-although I would like to see Teradata use those kinds of statistics to broadcast its message more effectively. What I can say is that going back for a decade, TDC was considered by analysts and users always the most expensive solution and now it is the cheapest. Eventually users react to those kinds of differences-and to the extent that the 20%-25% growth in product ARR is an indicator, they already are.One of the major issues for Teradata is overcoming user reluctance to adding an additional database to their environments. The company, at least over the past year or so, has attempted to reach out to that concern by making it easier for users to consume Teradata in multiple environments without many constraints. Again, from the CEO script., “Fourth, move anytime. With TDC Everywhere, we’ve revolutionized software license portability so companies can move their software where needed across deployment options. There is no lock-in as with other vendors. This is an enterprise software industry first.”I am not sure if this iteration of license portability is really a first, but it is certainly a marked differentiator compared to TDC’s larger competitors. In some ways, it is a similar strategy to that being adopted by Nutanix (NTNX) which allows its software stack to be used on most hardware platforms depending on user needs.TDC’s most salient competitive disadvantage is that it is specializes in one technology and competes with giant vendors who are able to leverage their incumbent status as a DBMS vendor. Many of the larger vendors have incorporated some of the features necessary to support analytical applications without the need for a specialized database, In some cases that restricts TDC’s potential in a client to the most demanding analytical use cases. That has been a marketing issue since TDC has been a company; it seems likely that the proportion of more demanding analytical use cases has risen as this market segment has shown rapid growth.Teradata has probably never had a better competitive position than is the case currently. It always has had a differentiated database suitable for complex queries. Its advantages in doing that job have seeming been reinforced over the years. It has far more flexible consumption options than its competitors and contrary to its long-held position as selling solutions at a premium, it has become the bargain solution in normal environments. The company’s challenge isn’t technology or competition but to communicate its advantages and to close deals.It isn’t a simple task to reverse negative momentum and this company has to overcome many negative perceptions that were allowed to fester amongst its users and potential customers. But I think it is fair to suggest that TDC should start to achieve market share gains and big deal success. While retuning the organization to enhance sales execution is a something that still has a ways to go, the company is equipped to win against it major rivals.The market for Data Management/Analytics is quite large, with most observers projecting the TAM at over $100 billion including both hardware and software. IDC projects this market to have a CAGR of 12% over the next few years. A competitive TDC, in a market growing at 12%, would readily stand consensus expectations for growth on their head. IDC, in its October report suggests the market size currently is $130 billion. Teradata has substantial growth opportunities in this market-it simply needs to marshall its strengths and execute properly in order to restore double digit growth in revenues and rapid growth in EPS. Needless to say, however, that is not that simple of a task.Teradata, as was pointed out at the start of this article, has seen chronic underperformance of its shares for several years now and is one of the rare tech companies that is nowhere near a high, selling at less than half the price the shares once fetched. Teradata currently has about 126 million fully diluted shares outstanding and at current market prices, it has a capitalization of $4.4 billion. With net cash of just less than $500 million, the enterprise value of Teradata is $3.9 billion. 2018 sales, as projected by management during the conference call should be around $2.2 billion. That calculates to an EV/S of 1.8X. I think that represents a bargain ratio and one moreover, that doesn’t represent a value trap.TDC is still in the early innings of an earnings turn-around, and the nature of a transition that involves switching the preponderance of revenues from up-front revenue recognition, to a mix of product consumption arrangements that involve multi-year terms, will be one that constrains rapid growth of EPS in its early stages. That said, the company has forecast that its EPS will reach in the range of $1.40-$1.45 next year, which is significantly greater than the current consensus as recorded by First Call. The P/E, based on TDC’s forecast is now 24.6X. In these days of generally elevated valuations, a 25X P/E is a relative bargain, but a bargain only insofar as TDC can continue to nurture its very nascent revenue. growth recovery. Again, the basic theme of the preponderance of the analysts who have rated the shares at hold or sell, is that TDC remains road kill with no plausible scenario that will lead to a lasting growth recovery. I think that is shoddy analysis, that hasn’t chosen to look at the company’s latest developments.At this stage, TDC is not really a cash flow story although it has a relatively substantial free cash flow yield.. Cash flow from operations was negative last quarter and stands at $300 million for the first nine months of 2017. I don’t rate this company a cash flow story because most of its cash flow comes from the decline in receivables which is correlated to some degree to a decline in revenues. In addition, the decline in DSO, which is substantial, is not something that can be a longer term source of CFFO. The change in deferred revenues thus far this year has been negligible, and while it is likely to show a seasonal increase in Q4, at this point, ratable revenue arrangements are not seeing cash collections in advance of revenue recognition. That could possibly change going forward.As mentioned, TDC shares are almost completely unloved with but 2 lonely buy recommendations listed by First Call out of 22 analysts reporting their ratings. I personally think that is a good set-up for investors but not all will agree. At the end of the day, the question is simply will TDC be able to achieve the business goals the CFO laid out during the last call. The CFO (who is taking a medical leave after a long period of battling ill-health) has forecast a return to growth coupled with a strong increase in product ARR. The rating of the shares and the valuation metrics in no way reflect that there is any broad belief that this is a likely scenario. As I have pointed out, the company has better technology, at least in the view of third party market researchers, a very loyal installed base, very flexible terms for buying its solutions and very competitive prices. It is competing in a strongly growing market that should continue to see double digit expansion. It should be successful in achieving, and really over-achieving the objectives laid out by the CFO in what is presumably his swan song.It is hard to know when a turnaround gets recognized. In the case of TDC, while the company has shown some green shoots and a bit more, the recognition that it could be a major contender in its space has simply not yet happened. The company tried to enthuse analysts in its presentations last fall without success. I think that investors looking for a turnaround with substantial potential for positive alpha could do lots worse than consider TDC at this point but some level of patience will be required with owning this name."
4218885,103480,2018-11-06T15:06:41-05:00,"Teradata reported Q3 results that missed on revenue but beat on EPS.The company, however, has a good reason for the revenue miss: A faster-than-expected transition to cloud. Cloud bookings were 82% of the bookings mix this quarter, vs. 65%-70% expected.The company also is introducing a new product in Vantage, an analytics platform that helps with what Teradata has branded as ""pervasive data intelligence.""Going forward, a commitment to continued innovation as well as a cloud-based business model should re-invigorate Teradata's business.","Like many other technology companies in the third-quarter earnings season, Teradata (NYSE:TDC) reported mixed results in Q3: A substantial beat on EPS, but missing top-line estimates. However, Teradata has a good reason for it: A faster-than-expected transition into subscription and cloud-based bookings.The subscription bookings mix has been one of the major focuses for Teradata's management as well as its investors over the past year. Teradata is one of the last backend software companies to embrace a subscription, recurring revenue business model. Of course, the sudden pivot to a recurring revenue business model has near-term drawbacks: Whereas previously you might have signed on a six or seven-figure deal that gets recognized as revenues in a single quarter, now that deal's revenue gets chopped up into a lot of smaller pieces (but with overall greater lifetime value) over a longer period of time. This makes Teradata's quarterly results both optically ambiguous and difficult to judge. We need to account for the faster-than-expected bookings mix when putting Teradata's flat revenue growth in perspective.Last quarter was the same story. Teradata had achieved a 66% recurring revenue mix in its bookings, vs. a prior expectation of 50%-60%. As a result of outperformance in Q2, Teradata upped its recurring bookings mix to 65%-70% for the remainder of the year. This quarter, Teradata actually achieved an incredible 82% bookings mix. With new deals having almost fully transitioned to the cloud, the temporary pain of a cloud transition is almost over for Teradata. It's not raising its bookings mix guidance for the remainder of the year, but instead commenting that the bookings mix will land at ""the higher end of a previous expected range of 65 percent to 70 percent.""Teradata's self re-invention goes beyond just its billings method as well: The company also announced a major product update in Teradata Vantage, an analytics platform in a category that Teradata has dubbed ""pervasive data intelligence."" Vantage's primary selling point is an ""always-on"" stream of real time insights that delivers not just the operational data, but answers, to business executives and users. Here's some further color on Vantage from COO Oliver Ratzesberger's prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call:In my view, Teradata stock is undeniably cheap despite its major progress in both product and cloud. Unlike many other tech stocks, Teradata didn't really have an impressive rally before the October correction brought its shares down, and it's currently trading very close to its 52-week lows:Its valuation multiple below 2x revenues speaks to its low growth, but with Teradata's growing gross and operating margins, it's more of a value and future cash flow play than it is a growth stock. In my view, Teradata is worth a second look at its current bargain-basement prices.Let's dive into Teradata's third-quarter results in further detail. The headlining figure, of course, is how Teradata missed Wall Street's revenue estimates. Teradata generated revenues of $526.0 million, flat to the prior year, whereas Wall Street had hoped to see $534.8 million, or +2% y/y growth.A look at the breakout between recurring and perpetual revenues, however, helps to illustrate the tug-of-war between increasing the bookings revenue mix and pulling down near-term revenues:Figure 1. Teradata revenue breakdownSource: Teradata investor relationsAs Teradata's bookings mix shifted heavily into recurring, recurring revenues are up 9% y/y on an FX-neutral basis, but this also caused a -13% y/y drop in perpetual license revenues. We should focus on the fact, however, that recurring revenues are far more stabilizing for Teradata's future as well as having a positive margin impact now. The company also noted that it increased total ARR (annual recurring revenues) by $35 million in the quarter. Total ARR as of the end of Q3 stood at an impressive $1.24 billion.The remainder of Teradata's full results are below, taken from the company's earnings release:Figure 2. Teradata 3Q18 resultsSource: Teradata investor relationsAs can be seen above, gross margins have made a significant leap in the quarter, improving 270bps to 50.2%. The main driver of this improvement is a better recurring revenue mix, which has ~70% gross margins vs. just ~44% for perpetual licenses. This only stresses the point that while perpetual license revenues created big revenue wins in a single quarter, they aren't as accretive to the bottom line as recurring revenues. Teradata also has long carried a margin deficit to software peers, which tend to have gross margins in the 70%-80% range, so the bump in margins this quarter is refreshing. You'll notice as well that Teradata has effectively been able to freeze its operating expenses: Both R&D as well as selling, general and administrative expenses have remained rather flat year-over-year. As a result, the company managed to drive a 100bps improvement in operating margins to 2.7%.Teradata also achieved EPS of $0.36 in the quarter, or 16% upside to Wall Street's targets of $0.31. It also maintained its full-year free cash flow guidance of $175-$200 million - which, when considering accelerated capex for the build-out of the company's San Diego headquarters, still represents a respectable ~10% FCF margin that can only improve as the company pivots more into higher-margin subscriptions.Teradata is an often overlooked legacy technology company that currently trades at an incredible value. Despite being a lower-growth stock, the company is still managing to assert its relevance in the big data/analytics space. It also successfully exercised expense discipline in order to keep operating margins and free cash flows above water, despite a subscription transition that negatively impacts near-term revenues. Stay long on this stock."
4094132,98236,2017-08-03T05:06:45-04:00,"Teradata reported the results of its second quarter last week.While the headline numbers appeared disappointing, sub-headline numbers and management discussion and guidance were highly positive.The shares appreciated modestly although not enough to make up from a big performance deficit over the past year.Analysts hate this name, and the short interest is high, setting the stage for outsized appreciation if the company's transition continues as management has forecast.TDC has a valuation that substantially belies its progress recently and which harks back to the disappointing results under prior management.","Last week, Teradata (NYSE:TDC) one of the worst ranked names in the enterprise IT space, at least looking at the First Call consensus rating, reported its numbers for the June ending quarter. The results were said to be a miss. The shares rallied 8%. Sometimes, it is good to be despised; it gets you a bye in the first rounds.In point of fact, as most readers are aware, just looking at headline numbers, or indeed many other different metrics, is often likely to lead to a misleading conclusion for an IT vendor starting to make a journey to a business model based on the cloud and on subscription revenues.Why bother with this name - isn’t just roadkill on the big-data highway? How is it going to be able to reinvent itself and compete with some of the newer, sexier big data alternatives? Well, that is the thing - is it really road kill? Once upon a time - oh, say seven years ago, this company was said to be a pioneer in the big data/analytics space. It had a large installed base and it was able to sell that base a product called the Enterprise Data Warehouse. And then the world started to change rapidly and Teradata did not change with it.Fast forward six years and TDC was in crisis with its products no longer relevant and its largest single vertical, retail, no longer in a position to buy much in the way of non-operational information technology. The board replaced the CEO and the CEO began to develop a new strategy - a fairly obvious strategy of focusing the company's new solutions on cloud deployment and making consumption of TDC solutions available on a multiplicity of platforms. In addition, parts of the strategy involved enhancing the company’s specific areas of comparative advantage and building a differentiated level of professional service capability.The company held an analyst meeting last autumn at which it released its road map to redemption. To put it politely, the audience was very skeptical and the shares declined in the wake of the meeting. And there they have stagnated. Even after the recent share price reaction to the quarter, the shares are up but 19% from the low they reached after that ill-starred meeting. That compares to a 28% move on the part of the IGV index over the same time period.OK, I will say it here - my enthusiasm for the shares was…well, a bit premature. In the context of soaring shares prices in the tech world, finding a reasonably valued name is a chore and having to deal with what looks like road-kill is inevitable. This is a company that stood athwart some important trends in enterprise IT and has so far blown its chances to be a leader. I am forecasting that the company has just a large enough customer base that seems loyal and a new leader who is focused on investing in the good parts of this business to at least reach the status of contender in this space. The company announced a nine-figure deal last quarter and several large wins this quarter; at least some of the company’s customers have started to make some sizeable commitments to its newer offerings at levels of enough significance that validate the strategy.While I will return to some valuation perspectives later, at the current share price, TDC has a market cap of $4.1 billion and an enterprise value of $3.5 billion. That calculates to an EV/S of less than 1.8X on this year’s abysmal sales numbers. The consensus, at least before the earnings release, reflected no growth next year in either earnings or in revenues. I think it is relatively straightforward to suggest just how significant the appreciation might be if there are signs that the transition laid out by management last fall is starting to fall into place.Seventy-five years ago, in the wake of the Allied victories at El Alamein and the successful landings by American forces in North Africa, Winston Churchill told his audience at the Lord Mayor’s Luncheon that the victory at El Alamein coupled with the successful landings of our forces in North Africa was not the beginning of the end - but it was, perhaps, the end of the beginning.The results that TDC reported last week were certainly no indication of a turn, at least in terms of the headlines that were published. And yet, the qualitative commentary during the earnings conference call and company guidance has been interpreted by some, including this writer/investor, as an indication that the company has reached the end of the beginning. Most of the rest of this article will discuss the details of this evolution for TDC and what cadence has been forecast in terms of future improvements.It is a story that is worth considering for investors, simply because the potential returns are so significant given just how much the shares have been hated by analysts.Overall, Teradata reported revenues of $513 million, a decline of 14% year on year. The company disposed of its marketing solutions business in the summer of 2016 - the “organic” decline in revenues was 9%. Gross margins declined for several reasons including mix, lower volume and significant investment in consulting services, a key part of the company’s strategy to achieve differentiation in its space. The company has made a noticeable commitment to ramp research and development spend which grew by 53% last quarter (GAAP), reaching 15% of revenues - a relatively significant investment for a company of TDC's scale. In addition, the company’s selling, general and administrative costs have started to grow. The company is hiring more sales teams and ramping its ability to process contracts as sales activity grows and the deal funnel starts to ramp noticeably. Overall, the company broke even on a GAAP basis and reported a modest level of EPS substantially based on amortization and stock-based comp.The company’s operating cash flow of $61 million was essentially all derived from the balance sheet which shrunk due to its transition. That said, the company is generating more CFFO than it had forecast. The company bought back a bit more than 3 million shares of stock this quarter reducing outstanding shares by 2.7% year on year.Deferred revenues, which had increased sharply on a seasonal basis in Q1, declined seasonally in Q2. The company had a 10% increase in product subscription revenues while its traditional perpetual license revenue bucket declined by 41%.All of the salient headline operating numbers came in below prior expectations. Even though TDC's shares are relatively inexpensive, I think, these numbers would seeming not be able to support the current share price…except for management commentary and forward guidance.The company still does not report the kind of metrics that make analysis easy. It doesn’t report or forecast a bookings proxy - although during the conference call, it said that bookings last quarter grew by close to 15%. It said in the financial press release that Product Annual Recurring Revenue “continues to meaningfully increase as more of Teradata’s customers adopt its new purchasing options.”During this latest earnings conference call, management discussed the actual sales results when adjusting for the transition to ratable procurement arrangements. It turns out that actually adding in the $58 million of such arrangements yields a number that was above projections for the combination of license and license equivalent subscriptions by a bit. The numbers suggest that this metric, whatever it should be labeled, actually started to show modest growth in Q2. The Q2 attainment showed 16% sequential growth from the Q1 level as well, and the company is forecasting that 2H will see growth of about 20% from the levels of 1H. That is quite possibly conservative given normal Q4 seasonality.Management is now forecasting that this metric has bottomed out and it expects an increase in total equivalent product revenue in the second half of 2017. That would be a notable attainment. In the second quarter, as mentioned earlier, perpetual product revenues declined by more than 40%, or $63 million. It is likely that declines of that magnitude will continue for the balance of the year so bookings of license equivalent subscription transactions will have to show marked acceleration in order to match the company’s forecast.The company still does not precisely forecast the growth in annual recurring product revenue. It is forecasting that product ARR will reach about $350 million this year up by about 25% overall. Management did say it thought that it is at the earliest stage of seeing ARR growth which will translate into revenues by 2018. It also said that it expected to see the ARR metric rise by another 25% or close to $100 million in 2018.The balance of ARR for this company is essentially maintenance. Maintenance revenues are still growing; they were up 5% year over year and were up 4% sequentially. It is likely that the company will be able to maintain its maintenance revenue base for some period of time as it will continue to sell upgrades to customers with installed perpetual license installations and that should sustain maintenance revenues.As mentioned, the CFO presented a few targets for 2018 results. Product ARR is expected to increase in the mid 20% range next year. Total revenues are expected to grow as well. The body language as well as some snippets of commentary was such as to suggest that this company thinks it has ""seen the elephant."" There is probably not quite enough information available with which to construct any kind of full-blown model.That said, overall, I think at the moment forecasting that total revenues will grow in the mid-single digits is probably a prudent expectation. The company should start to reverse the declines in services gross margins seen this year and 5% growth should be enough to overtake the growth in opex modestly. If it all works out that way, the company ought to see some modest improvements in non-GAAP operating margins. Coupled with a reduction in outstanding shares, reasonable expectations for 2018 earnings might be in the range of $1.40-1.50. Given the company’s valuation and the disdain in which the shares are held by analysts, I think that those kinds of results ought to be enough to reverse the almost totally negative sentiment on this name.At this point, I think potential investors in TDC are probably wondering why this company might be successful going forward after several years of abysmal operational performance. There are several answers that probably make sense at this point. One of the likely reasons for signs of life at this company is affording potential users the kind of purchasing options that most large users insist on these days. This kind of effect has been seen time and time again - examples range from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) to Aspen (NASDAQ:AZPN), PTC Corp. (NASDAQ:PTC) and of course Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and perhaps Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Users really will buy more software if they can buy it on a subscription basis, than if they have to pay for it up-front. Seems silly, but the examples are all there.A second issue is new use cases. TDC got its start in life selling to the retail vertical - this company was, after all, a part of NCR (NYSE:NCR). Data warehousing is a concept initially adopted by retail users. Needless to say, the decimation wrought by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (AWS) in the retail space has made it necessary for this company to find other applications and other verticals. The product it leads with these days is called IntelliFlex and IntelliFlex has been used to significantly extend TDC’s scope in terms of different verticals.I think a third reason for success is that the company now actually does have a set of modern technologies including tiered all flash arrays, and some attributes/benefits of hyper convergence. And it has a very broad range of deployment options including Microsoft Azure, AWS, the TDC cloud and in the data center using either TDC hardware or user hardware. TDC can sell flexibility and scalability to a degree that was not possible a year ago, and that is a key component in the company’s go to market story. For some years, TDC did not have a good story to tell relative to either Redshift or Snowflake and that made it difficult to secure large orders. Those days are apparently behind the company at this point.Finally, what this company sells remains a focus of user spending intentions. TDC is a real BI vendor, and while it has never totally enjoyed the rising tide of BI spending, its moves in terms of deployment options, product refresh coupled with a higher consulting skill level seem likely to reignite growth in spaces that are growing quite rapidly. The market in which TDC competes is forecast to achieve a 10% CAGR through the end of the decade; the forecast growth has been relatively consistent for several years. What hasn’t been consistent is the ability of TDC to compete effectively in that space. I have linked here to an IDC study on the size and trends in the market.Needless to say, the markets in which TDC competes are well populated with competitors. TDC has scored well on Gartner evaluations for a long time, and as linked here in the 2017 analysis, it continues to be the absolute leader in terms of solution capability followed closely by Oracle and Microsoft. Gartner sees the company as offering the most advanced solution in what is called the Data Management Solutions for Analytics (DMSA) space. Users, even after all of the disappointments TDC has suffered through, continue to regard it as the standard in the DMSA space. It is almost always going to be on the short list of DMSA evaluations.Teradata still has to overcome its perception as being a very high-priced competitor. I think it is fair to say that for many years, the company used its market position to squeeze users significantly and it still has that reputation. A few years ago, TDC was able to charge double or more per unit of storage consumption compared to its competitors. Those days are over now, but some of the aura from that era lingers on.While Gartner is concerned about competition from the likes of Oracle and SAP (NYSE:SAP), my own concern relates more to the newer competitors in the space including Snowflake and Redshift. Snowflake is a small independent vendor and Redshift is Amazon’s data warehouse offering.Redshift is reputedly “ludicrously fast” and is the world’s first fully GPU-Accelerated biased renderer. I just loved the link shown here which portrays one of the applications in which Redshift can be employed. Do keep the image linked here away from small children. And no, your writer is not completely sure what that means and it will not help you make money on stocks, but it sure sounded catchy. It is part of a solution that allows animators to use a data warehouse to build their product offerings.Snowflake calls itself the only data warehouse built for the cloud. I am not quite sure as to what that means in terms of specific user benefits. Gartner says that Snowflake had been considered by users to have a very expensive pricing model. Most recently, the company dropped its costs for storage substantially.Given where TDC sits and what initiatives it has taken, I think it is reasonable to believe that it ought to be able to maintain its truncated market share going forward. That implies double-digit growth and achieving that would dramatically increase share values for the company. And that brings us to a few thoughts about TDC’s potential valuationIn trying to evaluate valuation parameters for a company like this, one can readily get embroiled in discussions of how to utilize the metrics that are most often employed in a valuation analysis. Is there some objective standard by which investors can determine the companies' normalized growth rate? I will say right now that there is really no realistic way at this point for determining what TDC’s business model will look like as the transition accelerates.I really think it is most relevant to look at many other software vendors that have most recently been going through similar transitions from on-prem to subscription revenue models to get a perspective on what can happen - and is perhaps most likely to happen. This company’s messaging with regards to the transition and to the key metrics remains more than a bit garbled; that is going to be a necessary and very important improvement the company will need to make if it is to attain the kind of valuations investors have provided to other IT transitions.But in no particular order, companies that have gone through years of transition with published headline metrics far removed from any correlation with the share price include Aspen, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), Adobe, Tableau (NYSE:DATA), Oracle. There are many companies in the space that have made or are making similar transitions; in some cases, the share price has performed exceptionally, although usually that requires an appropriate amount of lifting on the part of the company. So far, despite significant efforts by this management including the open market purchase of $1 million by the CEO the other day, the efforts of TDC in regard to helping investors to understand its program have yet to bear much fruit.Just for the record, I will present the standard valuation metrics I most often use in establishing some framework and screen for evaluating the shares of a prospective investment.I have already discussed the EV/S metric, which at less than 2X would be a remarkable metric if/when the company established a cadence of double-digit revenue growth - my expectation as I tried to explain in this article.Again, as I have discussed earlier, I think a reasonable expectation for forward EPS is in the range of $1.45 over the coming 12 months, although that number could be readily surpassed depending on just how substantial Q4 seasonality can be. That is a P/E of 22X-again; on a relative basis quite remarkable if the investment thesis is valid.The company has projected that it will achieve free cash flow this year of between $250 and $275 million, substantially greater than the non-GAAP earnings forecast of $160 million. Of the $100 million difference, stock based comp is likely to make up more than half of that amount and the full year increase in the deferred revenue balance is likely to make up more than another half. So far, the balance sheet has been a big contributor to cash generation. That is almost certainly going to reverse in the second half of the year and overall, again given how the Q4 spike turns out, CFFO in Q4 particularly could well be negative. But going forward, part of TDC’s valuation is likely to come from a significant positive gap between free cash flow and report non-GAAP EPS. Based on the company’s current forecast for the free cash flow metric, the free cash flow yield this year is 7.4%. Based on the trajectory of earnings and bookings, the free cash flow number is going to show a noticeable increase, probably greater than reported earnings, in the next 12 months.I can’t quite classify TDC shares as a dusty corner. As it is, the company is covered by 22 analysts who report their ratings and forecasts to First Call. On the other hand, through today, Teradata is rated as a buy by only two covering analysts while it is rated as underperform or sell by eight analysts with the balance rating the shares as hold. It seems clear that there are far more skeptics than believers amongst analysts which is probably the foundation for a great set-up in terms of share price appreciation.As of the latest reported period, TDC had a short interest of over 20 million shares, or close to 20% of the float. Almost none of the stock is currently held by retail investors, suggesting that there is certainly a significant runway for greater valuation as investors search for IT investments that haven’t yet seen substantial appreciation.While TDC has the profile that might well fit that of a potential industry consolidator, and is of a size such as not to preclude many potential buyers from making a bid, I doubt if the company has been the subject of much attention in that regard. I seriously doubt that the CEO would have been able to buy $1 million of shares if he had actually been in any kind of potential merger discussions. So, investors considering the name have to do so based on their expectations of enhanced operational performance. I think there is more than enough reason to expect that will be the case, and I do expect substantial positive alpha going forward."
4312159,102661,2019-12-12T12:48:30-05:00,"Teradata's transition to a recurring revenue model does not fully explain its struggles around financial performance, and the company's problems may be deeper.It is possible that some of its core data warehousing customers are leaving the Teradata ecosystem, while its flagship analytics platform, Teradata Vantage, is failing to gain significant traction.Lacking an obvious set of catalysts to return to growth and stronger profitability, the stock is arguably speculative but still might be considered by some investors.","The article was also shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more about PRO+ here.Incorporated over 40 years ago in 1979 on the basis of academic research, Teradata (TDC) has its roots as a pioneer in large parallel processing systems. The founders of the company sought to commercialize a specialized relational database management system (""RDBMS"") that could serve ""...a large number of concurrent [user requests] from multiple client applications"". This may not seem like a ""big deal"" to readers today. But the company's unique systems engineering developments in its early years within the fields of parallel computing and online analytical processing (""OLAP""), which still underpin Teradata Database today, maybe rightly considered revolutionary.I would propose that Teradata emerged as the leader in enterprise-scale data warehousing - perhaps unquestionably so in the last 2 decades of the 20th century. But, today we find a company that is in trouble despite its progression beyond the integrated data warehouse (""IDW"") to its latest evolution of a strong analytic offering, Teradata Vantage (""Vantage""). The company has seen quarter-over-quarter revenue declines in Q1, Q2, and Q3 this year. And, based on management's guidance, it will see a decline in Q4 as well. It appears Teradata will end FY '19 somewhere around $1.88BB in total revenue, which represents a 13% decline over FY '18 revenue, and a GAAP loss in the range of ($0.20) to ($0.15) per share. The company's hand-picked CEO, Oliver Ratzesberger, appears to have been removed unexpectedly in Q3 and replaced by Victor Lund, Executive Chairman of the Board, as interim CEO; with Mr. Lund already having served in that same interim capacity after the departure of CEO Michael Koehler, in FY '15. The stock has suffered since the company's Q3 FY '19 earnings call on November 7, closing at $31.12 prior to the call and closing at $25.36 as of the writing of this report, an over 18% decline.What explains Teradata's difficulties given the technological strength of its portfolio? Management, along with many analysts and investors, has suggested Teradata's transition from a business model long dominated by perpetual revenues to subscription revenues is the prime culprit, producing less predictable performance for now as the transition progresses, but ultimately leading investors to financial stability and eventual growth as the transition completes. I do think there is some truth to this assertion, but I also think it is not the whole truth. I believe Teradata's problems are deeper, and this report delves into what those problems may be. My key points, discussed within the article, are summarized as follows:The company's traditional data warehouse business may be declining too rapidly, as some customers move to competitive platforms.Teradata Database and data warehousing remain at the center of Teradata's business. In fact, a Gartner analysis in March of this year of ""Critical Capabilities for Data Management Solutions for Analytics"" rated the company as the leader in all 4 data warehouse use cases examined in the report. Yet, Teradata's perpetual revenue segment - usually associated with the company's legacy data warehouse customers - is actually trending (effectively) toward zero. Considering that the company's consulting business is also in decline and that recurring revenue segment growth is expected to decelerate in FY '19, I make the inference that Teradata's traditional (perpetual license) data warehouse customers may, in fact, be migrating to competitive platforms at a rate such that the company is presently unable to compensate for the loss. If correct, then Teradata's very foundation may be fracturing.Teradata appears to be struggling to gain traction for its flagship analytics framework.In an effort to build upon Teradata Database whilst delivering greater value to its customers, Teradata has expanded beyond its data warehousing roots to provide Teradata Vantage, an ambitious analytics offering that encompasses multiple enabling technologies working in concert to deliver a suite of analytic capabilities against most or all of a customer's source data systems (Teradata and/or non-Teradata). While sound, certain indicators suggest the concept may not be resonating among large, ""data-heavy"" customers who lie at the heart of Teradata's current go-to-market approach. I hypothesize this, in turn, may result from the scope of the platform which requires customers implementing their own Vantage infrastructures to buy-in to an architectural model, as well as enabling technologies. As anyone who has worked in the enterprise software space knows, selling an organization on an architectural vision is like selling religion: it can be a very painful process, often met with skepticism and pushback that can take a considerable amount of time to overcome.Depressed profitability, headwinds impacting portfolio adoption, and no obvious catalyst for growth make for a speculative stock at current levels.Teradata's operating margin has fallen from over 10% in FY '16 to a hair above 1% for the 9-months ended September 30, 2019. While this trend is partially explained by the transition to recurring revenue, the company's operating expenses as a percentage of sales have steadily increased as overall revenue declines. As profitability evaporates, there does not appear to be any clear catalyst that management can leverage in an effort to return Teradata to sales and, more importantly, earnings growth. In fact, past spending on acquisitions and nearly $2BB of stock buybacks may have left the company somewhat constrained in terms of the levers it can ""pull"". While I do believe the stock to be expensive at current levels ($25.36 as this report is written), it is possible the share price will decline over the next couple quarters as the company attempts to ""steady the ship"". While it is very difficult, if not impossible, to establish a price range that offers a reliable margin of safety, I offer in Section 6.0 that enterprising investors might consider betting a small portion of their portfolio should the price fall into the ""teens"".As a disclosure, I worked for Teradata during my enterprise software sales career. The content of this report is based on publicly available data only, and any conclusions expressed herein are based on such data and/or my general experience in enterprise software. Additionally, investors should do their own research before investing in any company and should consider consulting a professional financial advisor which I am not.Teradata has been struggling to demonstrate consistent growth of its top and bottom lines for several years:Figure 2.1 Teradata Sales and Net Income FY '14 - FY '18Data Source: Teradata Annual Report FY '16 - FY '18Chart Source: Yves SukhuWe see that there was some stabilization between FY '17 and FY '18 on both lines. Unfortunately, however, revenue performance through Q3 FY '19 has seen the company return to a negative sales trend:Figure 2.2 Teradata Quarterly Revenue FY '18 - FY '19Data Source: Teradata Q3 FY '19 Earnings ReleaseTable Source: Yves SukhuGuidance for the full-year FY '19 is offered in the Q3 FY '19 Earnings Release with management stating ""for the full-year, Teradata expects ARR to increase at least 8% and recurring revenue to increase approximately 8% to 9%. Teradata now expects approximately a $250 million decline in perpetual revenue as the shift to subscription-based bookings continues to exceed the company's expectations. As the company continues to realign its consulting business to focus on higher-value consulting services that increase consumption, Teradata now expects consulting revenue to decline approximately 25%, more than the 20% it previously expected."" Using these statements along with FY '18 data in Figure 3.2, we can establish individual segment revenue and total revenue forecasts for FY '19:At full-year FY '19 guidance of $1,885MM, the company would see a roughly 13% total revenue decline over FY '18. Readers might be interested to note that Teradata has also recorded reduced revenue in every geography, including its largest geographic segment - the Americas, through Q3 FY '19:Figure 2.3 Teradata Geographic Revenue 9-Months Ended Sep 30, 2019Data Source: Teradata Earnings Release Q3 FY '19If there are any ""highlights"" within Teradata's numbers through Q3 FY '19 thus far, it would be the increase in recurring revenues versus the prior-year period. Indeed, such revenue represented 90% of the company's bookings mix in Q3 FY '19. For reference, Teradata defines bookings mix as ""subscription bookings divided by the sum of subscription bookings plus perpetual bookings"". We might initially be encouraged, and management certainly makes many efforts to call investor attention to its subscription performance, noting in the Q3 FY '19 Earnings Summary that ""[the company] continues its successful transformation to a recurring revenue model"". However, perhaps all is not as it seems with management's claims of successfully transitioning the business.3.1. Still a LeaderTeradata continues its technological leadership in the field of data warehousing. I, again, call readers' attention to the Gartner report I referenced in the Introduction, as well as that company's associated Magic Quadrant for Data Management Solutions for Analytics from January 2019 which highlights Teradata as a ""leader"":Figure 3.1 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Management Solutions for AnalyticsSource: Teradata.comIt stands to reason that the migration of Teradata's legacy data warehouse customers from a perpetual license model to a subscription model has functioned as the engine of the company's conversion to a business-led by recurring revenue streams; and Teradata has made noteworthy efforts to streamline the process for their customers as with Teradata Everywhere, a flexible licensing and technical initiative that TDWI referred to as a ""godsend...for companies attempting to negotiate a phased shift to the cloud."" The company went so far as to redesign Teradata Database itself under this program in order to enable customers to operate in any environment of their choosing - on-premise with Teradata hardware, on-premise with 3rd-party hardware, public cloud, private cloud, etc. - with a single codebase that preserves service-levels and the unique parallel processing advantages of the Teradata Database system.3.2. The Forecast Looks Like Headwinds For Teradata DatabaseIndicative of their success with customer migration, we do see accelerating growth in Teradata's recurring revenue segment through FY '18, but a forecasted deceleration in FY '19:Figure 3.2 Teradata Recurring Segment Revenue GrowthData Source: Teradata Annual Report FY '16 - FY '18, Teradata Earnings Release Q3 FY '19Table Source: Yves SukhuWhat can explain the slowing growth expected for this fiscal period? Could it be an issue of execution? Management obliquely offered this suggestion on the company's FY '19 earnings call as a reason behind Mr. Ratzesberger's dismissal. Could it be that the majority of Teradata's perpetual license data warehouse customers have already migrated to subscription licenses? If this is true, it would help us understand the dramatic year-over-year 69% drop in perpetual revenue for the 9 months ended September 30 seen in Figure 2.3. But, investors should be open to another possibility: some - perhaps many - Teradata customers, historically running with perpetual software and/or hardware licenses, maybe migrating portions of or complete workloads to competitive solutions at a rate such that the company cannot sufficiently compensate with new recurring revenue streams. Consider:1. In its Annual Report FY '16, Teradata offered a set of metrics to provide investors with greater insight into the business as it transitions to a recurring revenue model. Among these metrics was ""TCORE Growth"" which essentially attempted to measure customer usage of the Teradata Database via a processing-capacity approach (see the annual report for the formal definition). Of course, increasing TCORE Growth values over time is what the company and investors alike would hope to see, as that trend would be indicative of increasing customer usage of and workloads on Teradata Database. The company also offered a ""Business Consulting Revenue Growth"" metric to quantify growth of more strategic consulting services (e.g. architecture services) versus tactical services offerings (e.g. product installation services). Teradata provided a complementary definition for this latter metric, noting that it acted as a ""leading indicator of future TCORE growth."" Interestingly, Business Consulting Revenue Growth was not mentioned in Teradata's Annual Report FY '17, and neither metric was mentioned in the company's Annual Report FY '18. While it is possible Teradata continues to utilize these metrics internally, their somewhat rapid appearance and disappearance from external reporting are a bit odd and could imply decreasing use of Teradata Database.2. Overall, consulting revenues, have experienced a downward trend over the last few fiscal periods, including the expected 25% year-over-year decline for the FY '19 fiscal period:Figure 3.3 Teradata Consulting Segment Revenue DeclineData Source: Teradata Annual Report FY '16 - FY '18, Teradata Earnings Release Q3 FY '19Table Source: Yves SukhuIf customers were maintaining (or ideally growing) their Teradata workloads, whether migrating to new environments/subscription models or not, should we not expect consulting revenues to at least remain roughly flat as those customers seek to drive continued value from their Teradata systems? At the very least, we probably would not expect steep declines; but that is precisely what we see. Perhaps some investors might argue the declines result from the company's intent to shift the consulting business from tactical engagements to strategic engagements, as hinted in the previous bullet. But, this explanation does not seem to ""hold water"" given that the company's own metric for measuring such strategic engagements appears to have been temporarily or permanently eliminated. While it is only an inference, the astonishing loss of consulting revenue is suggestive (but not conclusive) of customer workloads leaving Teradata's ecosystem.3. Teradata appears to be a bit ""stingy"" reporting net retention rate data. Certainly, if subscription revenue is healthy with representative customers maintaining or growing their data warehouse spend over time, investors might reasonably expect the company to highlight such results. Accordingly, the absence of this data rightfully elicits thoughts around customer defections.4. The company defines recurring revenues as ""...[including] maintenance, software upgrade rights, subscription-based transactions and managed services."" But, investors are not offered a breakdown of the contribution of each recurring revenue component. As such, investors have no empirical data to compare against their own expectations for subscription-based revenue growth. Arguably, subscription-based revenue is the most important sub-stream as it can act as a sales-oriented proxy helping to gauge Teradata Database utilization, in an analogous way that the TCORE Growth metric acted as a processing-capacity proxy for usage. Using similar logic from the previous bullet, if growth of subscription-based revenue has been robust, why not publish that data? Gross margin data for the recurring segment actually does suggest a growing contribution from subscription-based revenue. For example, Teradata reported that recurring revenue gross margin was slightly depressed in Q3 FY '19 at 67.9% versus 70.2% in Q3 FY '18, and noted that ""the lower margin year-over-year was due to the recurring revenue mix in the third quarter having more subscription-based revenue, which carries lower margins than revenue from perpetual related maintenance and software upgrade rights as a result of embedded hardware rentals in our subscription business."" This result corresponds with a longer trend toward lower recurring segment margins, with full-year FY '18 recurring segment gross margin at 70.2% versus FY '17 at 73.4%. So, on the surface, this is good news and it is what we want to see: increasing contribution from subscription-based sales. However, when we study this data against segment revenue data, we could argue that Teradata is not growing subscription-based transactions fast enough. The following table breaks out segment revenues on a quarterly basis for FY '17 - FY '19:Figure 3.4 Teradata Quarterly Revenues by SegmentData Source: Teradata Annual Report FY '17 - FY 18, Teradata Earnings Release Q1, Q2, Q3 FY 19Table Source: Yves SukhuIn FY '18, Teradata managed to gain more recurring revenue year-over-year than it lost in perpetual license and consulting revenues, suggesting, along with gross margin data, that subscription-based transactions helped to mitigate losses. However, we see that in FY '19, using management guidance to forecast Q4 revenues, the company may lose around $3.60 in perpetual license and consulting revenue year-over-year for every dollar that it gains in recurring revenue. In an effort to explain the spread, Teradata bulls might offer that subscription-based sales are recognized over time; and they would be correct to make such a statement. But, raising my prior thought on usage again, if Teradata Database customer workloads are even just keeping steady, would we expect to see such a large spread? I posit that the substantial losses in perpetual license and consulting revenue cannot solely be explained by customers migrating to a subscription-based model.3.3. Further InterpretationTeradata seems to be making progress growing its subscription-based revenue, which I reiterate as the most important element of its recurring segment revenue stream. But, the growth appears weak against the steep losses seen with the company's perpetual license and consulting segments. From my perspective, this is suggestive - but not conclusive - of an ongoing decline in Teradata Database usage with some fraction of customers likely migrating to competitive platforms. I believe this theory to be even stronger in light of the company's apparent decision to reverse course on the provision of metrics meant to highlight workload growth.We might speculate that more Teradata customers have left the platform in the last couple fiscal periods versus prior periods being that we see more abrupt declines in perpetual license revenue and consulting revenue in FY '18 and FY '19. Why should this be? I have a few thoughts. First, from Figure 3.1, we see that Teradata is hardly alone in the Leaders quadrant. In fact, heavyweights Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon AWS (AMZN), and SAP (SAP) all rank higher than the company along the ""execution"" axis. Simply, despite the strength of its own solution, Teradata's competitors may be eating away at their market-share, perhaps on the basis of a cost-benefit equation. The aforementioned Gartner report does state that despite the company's otherwise high marks, ""[Teradata] had the lowest relative survey score in the impression of value for the money spent."" Second, recall from the last bullet above that maintenance revenues, which are an element of overall recurring segment revenue, are a higher margin sub-stream as compared to subscription-based transactions; and historically, gross margins for the recurring segment have been higher. It is my conjecture that Teradata may have gradually raised maintenance rates on its perpetual license customers over time - extracting increasing monetary value from that base - until most of those customers either converted to subscription-based licenses or migrated off Teradata. In regard to the potential for the latter activity, Teradata may be caught in a vicious cycle, common to legacy providers of perpetual-license technology, whereby increasing maintenance rates drive customers off their platform, inducing the company to increase rates further on remaining customers, which drives more customers away. And round and round it goes. Of course, I am only guessing here. But, the idea does ""fit"" the data, namely the considerable loss of perpetual and consulting revenue in recent periods: some customers may simply have become ""fed up"" with their maintenance costs.3.4. SummaryIf we agree that Teradata Database and associated data warehouse use cases remain at the center Teradata's business, and if my various inferences in this section are correct, the company may be impaired at its core. As to be discussed in the next section, Teradata Vantage may provide Teradata with a pathway to reform itself; but I argue this offering, also built around Teradata Database, appears to be struggling to gain traction.4.1 Silos No MoreAs mentioned in the Introduction, Teradata Vantage is a broad analytic offering, introduced in FY '18, and built around many of the same data warehousing technologies that have propelled Teradata thus far, including Teradata Database. It is useful to examine the value proposition underpinning the solution as it helps us understand how Teradata's intends to position Vantage in the marketplace.The company notes that the business problem they seek to solve with Vantage is ""analogous to the data problem in the early eighties [when companies] had a challenging time trying to store and analyze large volumes of data due to the limits of technology...[and so] conventional wisdom was to push data to functional data silos."" This ""data problem"", common to the early years of mainstream computing, is easy to conceptualize, if considerably more difficult to actually solve: companies would erect many independent ""silos"" of data, each of which would serve some specific purpose (e.g. sales data analysis, inventory data analysis, etc.). But, this decentralized approach made business-wide analysis of data extremely difficult and slow, if not impossible altogether. It is this precise problem that Teradata Database was invented to address, namely to offer a platform capable of centralizing all of a customer's data and coupled with capabilities to perform multiple, complex queries simultaneously and expediently.Figure 4.1: Silos Versus CentralizedSource: Teradata Vantage - Doing For Analytics What We Did For DataWith the explosion of new analytic languages/tools (e.g. R, Python) and techniques (e.g. machine learning), along with new data storage mediums (e.g. Hadoop, AWS S3) in modern computing environments, Teradata argues that companies are repeating the mistakes of the past by now building up analytic silos that each serve the particular requirements of some users (e.g. business analysts, data scientists, etc.) while ignoring the value of a business-wide analytics platform that provides a suite of analytic capabilities ""in one place"" for all types of users. The company stresses this newer silo ""phenomenon"" is also driven by a protectionist attitude within companies to discourage running new analytic workloads on existing IDWs. Given that silos - data and analytic alike - can result in a slew of unintended and undesirable outcomes, such as duplication of technology, functions, and data, their elimination can produce both efficiencies and cost savings.4.2. Teradata Vantage OverviewTeradata Vantage is the company's answer to the analytic silo problem. As with the ""data problem"" described in the preceding section, Vantage's value proposition is easy to conceptualize, but the implementation of supporting technologies implied by the model is arguably more challenging:Figure 4.2: Teradata Vantage High-Level ArchitectureSource: Teradata Vantage - Doing For Analytics What We Did For DataAs we see in Figure 4.2, Vantage is actually a multiple-layer architectural model, that:The SQL engine, illustrated in the mid-tier of the diagram, refers to the capabilities of Teradata Database. The machine learning and graph engines in the same tier refer to the capabilities of Aster Database, which Teradata obtained via its acquisition of Aster Data Systems in FY '11 for $259MM (excluding a prior 11.2% equity investment). Arguably, one of the more innovative aspects of Vantage lies in the coordinated and abstracted use of these engines. As I alluded to in the second bullet above, the company's vision is to allow a hypothetical user to submit a single query that may touch one or more engines, depending on the type of analysis required. A detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this article, but suffice it to say that different data structures (e.g. relational versus graph) are better suited to different types of analyses. One of Vantage's key ""powers"" is its ability to combine these engines in a single logical framework such that a user can easily orchestrate multiple analytical techniques to produce a desired result.So, we could say Teradata's idea is to be a ""one-stop-shop"" for analytics in a given customer's environment, abstracting the underlying complexities of accessing and analyzing data so that users need only be concerned with understanding how to use their favorite languages and query tools.With Vantage available as-a-service, organizations can immediately derive value with the platform through integration with their source data. Of course, larger companies with extensive, heterogeneous source systems; complex analytic requirements; and large user pools might seek to directly implement Vantage's enabling technologies within their own environments. And such customers are indeed prime candidates, with Teradata noting in its Annual Report FY '17 that they""...have realigned [their] go-to-market organization to target the 500 customers with the largest analytical opportunities worldwide."" Such organizations, with their own Vantage implementations, would prove especially lucrative over the long-term. But, as I suggested in the Introduction, the architectural model demanded by Vantage may not be palatable for some customers.4.3 More Headwinds In The ForecastWe can begin with, and expand on, the last point in the previous section to examine certain challenges that may be limiting Vantage adoption.1. We could argue that just about every enterprise software technology of significance implicitly carries an architecture. For example, my last Seeking Alpha article was on Datadog (DDOG), whose monitoring technologies have seen rapid adoption. It would be correct to say that customers using Datadog products have adopted a certain (monitoring) architecture related to those products. However, I propose that the architectural model related to Teradata's Vantage platform is more involved as it touches upon areas of technology that tend to be deeply embedded, often in an almost sacred way, within organizational computing environments. For example, if a target Vantage customer is generally an Oracle ""shop"", they are likely to be highly resistant to the notion of standing up a new architecture that involves a different RDBMS - i.e. Teradata Database. Simply, human beings are territorial with IT personnel perhaps more-so. Coming back to my example with Datadog, they too - certainly - experience similar resistance as I have just described. However, having previously sold in the IT Operations Management space, as well as most areas overlapping with Vantage's layered architecture, I offer my personal opinion that monitoring technologies are more easily displaced/complemented than other elements of the computing stack, such as database systems. So, in the case of Vantage, I do think Teradata is dealing with a bit of a ""pushing a rock uphill"" situation. To reiterate, the point here is relevant to those target customers who the company would desire to bring Vantage ""in-house"", since broad architectural implications for ""as-a-service"" customers do not exist. But, certainly, the ""real"" money for Teradata is with those customers who adopt a Vantage architecture for and in their own computing environments, along with the licensing for the enabling Teradata technologies. Therefore, the typical challenges driving an architectural model affecting ""protected"" areas of a customer's environment are likely in play here, and maybe resulting in long sales cycles for Vantage; although, as I imagine, the company is mitigating this dynamic by starting customers ""as-a-service"" while maintaining a parallel sales effort to drive ""in-house"" adoption.2. Some evidence - again, indirect - of the argument above that Teradata may be having troubling selling Vantage as an architectural model may be found in Teradata's past with its Unified Data Architecture (""UDA""). First introduced in the company's Annual Report FY '13, the UDA was described as a ""comprehensive enterprise approach that integrates our analytic data platforms and multiple technologies, including third-party provided products, into a cohesive data architecture...[which helps] customers access and manage data and extract ever greater business value and insight from their data."" Conceptually, this sounds very similar to Vantage. Consider also the following illustrated model of the UDA:Figure 4.3 Teradata Unified Data ArchitectureSource: Teradata Partners Conference 2013Taking a high-level view first, we note immediately a series of source data systems at the bottom level of the diagram and different classes of analytic users at the top level who are supported by an ecosystem of languages and analytic tools (the top grey bar). Even before considering the details in the middle levels, we could reasonably conclude this is an architecture that provides data query and analysis capabilities to a variety of users against a variety of sources, which is, overall, exactly what Vantage is designed to do. When we do examine the center of the model, we find the same general components as those that exist with Vantage, including a data fabric providing source integration and a set of analytic engines including Teradata Database and Aster Database. Accordingly, we might reasonably consider Teradata's UDA as the predecessor architecture to Vantage, effectively the same in-concept and with many of the same underlying technologies. If true, why did the company feel it necessary to repackage the offering? A straightforward answer to my question is that Vantage reflects the evolution of the company's technology and is more aligned with a business-oriented approach to selling and marketing the concept. However, the possibility exists that Teradata's UDA strategy failed to capture significant customer mindshare over the (roughly) five fiscal periods during which it was promoted and during which total revenue effectively declined year-over-year. Then Vantage is - in a certain sense - new branding that attempts to reverse the trend while representing the same general idea. Also, recall Teradata's (apparently) retired Business Consulting Revenue Growth metric (see Section 3.0). The company stated in its Annual Report FY '16 that ""[the metric includes] Analytics Consulting, Business Consulting, and Ecosystem Architecture, [although it] represents a small percent of total Company revenue."" Given that these engagements are representative of the consultative approaches usually required to sell architectural visions, perhaps there was a correlation between these engagements and UDA adoption. But, if these consulting engagements were only a small portion of revenue in FY '16, we can probably assume the same is true prior to FY '16. As the metric was not seen again after the company's Annual Report FY '16 we might guess that these specific consulting revenues have not grown significantly. If my inferences above are valid, we could extrapolate that UDA adoption was limited, and the same may be true now with Vantage.3. Teradata offers us a more direct reason why ""in-house"" implementations of Vantage may be particularly challenging to secure (and correspondingly, why UDA adoption may have been limited) in its Annual Report FY '12. In that report, Teradata notes that ""since mid-2012, [they] have seen a shift in the market and in customers' buying patterns, with respect to large capital investments and related services...[and they] believe that the greatest challenge for future revenue growth relates to pressures on large capital expenditures."" While an architecture does not have to be ""stood up"" all-at-once, just as a house can be built in sections, models such as Vantage nonetheless tend to carry a certain size and scope with an associated cost of enabling solutions (e.g. Teradata Database) and resources (e.g. architecture services). If Teradata must settle for smaller deal sizes, that is yet another barrier to adoption.4. On its Q3 FY '19 earnings call, Teradata highlighted an updated pricing model for Vantage, whereby customers only pay for ""completed queries"". Presumably, this pricing scheme is aimed at ""as-a-service"" customers. While I give credit to the company for designing an innovative pricing approach, I would not expect such an arrangement to produce a sustainable increase in sales for a couple reasons. First, the model may be difficult for Teradata to enforce consistently, and it may also be difficult for customers to measure their usage to ensure they remain in compliance with their own budgets and/or query allotments from the company. For example, if I am a Vantage user and I submit a query that entails 5 distinct analytic methods (in a sense, 5 sub-queries), does that constitute one query or 5 queries? What if each of those 5 sub-queries is themselves composed of sub-queries? Of course, Teradata will have some legal/contractual definition around usage. But, if that language leaves room for interpretation, it may present a risk to customers as they could be subject to unexpected auditing activities based on usage that they interpreted one way, and Teradata interpreted another way. Second, if it is an attractive pricing model, competitors will just copy it. Teradata noted on the Q3 FY '19 earnings call that they alone are offering this arrangement at the moment, and therefore it serves as a differentiator. However, I would suspect that if competitors are not duplicating the model, then they likely do not see value in it, in which case we might wonder how strong of a differentiator it actually is for Teradata. The pricing model may represent an attempt to drum up interest, which may be flagged for the platform.5. Perhaps the most obvious, though again indirect, piece of evidence suggesting Vantage is struggling is simply that Teradata provides no financial data on the offering. The company states in its Annual Report FY '18 that Vantage ""...experienced the fastest adoption rate of any offering in the company's history"". If true, why not quantify that in sales dollars for investors?4.4 SummaryPersonally, I think Teradata's approach to focus their sales efforts around the ""heaviest"" data customers around the world is well reasoned. But, technology companies usually focus on big customers for one reason: big deals. Yet, given the points of Section 4.3, we are left to wonder if the company is securing a significant volume of large transactions, Vantage or otherwise. Certainly, the trend in total revenue suggests the answer is ""no"". If Vantage adoption is indeed limited as I have argued extensively, the platform may, paradoxically, exist in vertical, siloed environments for niche analytic workloads which is the exact opposite of what Teradata is striving for.Despite the stock's recent decline, Teradata still looks to be an expensive bet on a trailing P/E basis and, arguably, an EV/EBITDA basis as well. Here are the numbers in comparison to the company's American competitors from the ""Leaders"" quadrant in Figure 3.1:Figure 5.1 Competitive DataNotes:Data Source: Yahoo FinanceTable Source: Yves SukhuI concede it is not entirely fair to compare Teradata against the competitors in the table given their size; but, still, why pay so much - relatively speaking - for a company that is not growing, weakly profitable, and possibly working with an impaired technology portfolio? It should be noted that Yahoo Finance offers a forward P/E of 17.88, and management did indicate on their Q3 FY '19 earnings call that investors should expect a substantial improvement in FY '20. Still, I struggle to model such significantly improved earnings for FY '20. What are the catalysts?Perhaps Teradata can overhaul the sales function. Indeed, the company noted on the same earnings call that the sales heads of the Americas and APAC have been replaced. However, my essential argument throughout this article is that Teradata's problems are more fundamental, and therefore not easily explained as a problem with sales execution. So, I would not expect a change in sales leadership and/or strategy to stimulate sales to such an extent as to drive a substantial increase in earnings. Furthermore, as we see in Figure 5.2 below, SG&A expense has been steadily increasing as Teradata has transitioned to a recurring revenue model.Figure 5.2 COGS & Expense Growth as a Percent of SalesData Source: Teradata Annual Report FY '16 - FY '18, Teradata Earnings Release Q3 FY '19Chart Source: Yves SukhuBear in mind that these costs have risen as total revenues have declined along with operating margins, the latter reflecting the lower profitability of subscription-based revenues versus perpetual revenues:Figure 5.3 Teradata Operating Margin FY '16 - FY '19 (E)Notes:Data Source: Teradata Annual Report FY '16 - FY '18, Teradata Earnings Release Q3 FY '19Chart Source: Yves SukhuSo, the company appears to be spending more on sales to sell less, and make less profit. Obviously, this is unsustainable, and we have no obvious reasons to think that things will change any time soon. Thus, echoing my earlier sentiment, I am skeptical that changes to the sales function will produce a material improvement in earnings in FY '20.Perhaps Teradata can raise prices, namely on its subscription customers. I doubt this strategy would be successful. If the company is having difficulty retaining customers as I have surmised, they certainly would not be in a position to raise license, maintenance, and/or services prices, at least not in a significant way. Furthermore, the pending deceleration in recurring revenue could suggest Teradata may, in fact, be overpriced relative to the market. The quote from the Gartner report in Section 3.3 seems to back up that assessment. If so, the company could find itself underpricing deals just to keep existing customers and improve the acquisition rate of new ones.Perhaps Teradata can cut costs. We see some minor improvements in COGS in Figure 5.2, but the trend in sales and R&D expenses is clear. We already discussed that the company may be paying more to sell less. R&D expense has roughly doubled since FY '16, and we would assume that has been so to keep pace in a highly competitive market. So, reduction in R&D or sales expense seems highly unlikely; and, if anything, these costs are headed higher.Perhaps market conditions will improve to favor Teradata's product portfolio. It goes without saying that the market for data management and analytics is incredibly strong, and demand is only likely to grow. ""Information is the new oil"" after all, as so many tech ""experts"" like to point out. This is evidenced by an almost innumerable number of market participants when one considers start-ups along with more established players. While continued market growth obviously benefits Teradata, the company's relatively poor financial performance over the last few years implies it has been unable to capitalize on strong market dynamics, and that in turn is suggestive of serious problems with its product portfolio, as discussed.Perhaps Teradata can ""acquire its way"" to future growth. Unfortunately, the company's opportunities appear limited. For example, Teradata acquired Aprimo, a provider of integrated marketing applications, for $525MM in FY '11. Just a few years later in FY '16, the company would sell the bulk of its marketing application business assets for $92MM to Marlin Equity, whilst incurring a total goodwill and intangible assets impairment of $558MM over the FY '15 and FY '16 fiscal periods. Also, since FY '14, Teradata has spent nearly $2BB on stock buybacks, a portion of which has been funded by debt. The combination of decreasing profitability and historical spending has resulted in limited resources to fund inorganic growth drivers, possibly pushing the company to raise capital in the future to finance any noteworthy acquisitions. Given Teradata's push to buy back stock, an equity raise would appear extremely unlikely. And, the company has assumed a fair amount of leverage over the years, with total debt surpassing 79% of assets in FY '18, versus 45.5% in FY '14. Thus, there appear to be limited prospects to acquire an entity of sufficient size and quality to bolster revenues and profits in the near-term.Given Oliver Ratzesberger's departure, perhaps a new CEO can implement a radically different strategy to alter Teradata's current trajectory. I would never underestimate what a creative and driven leader can achieve. However, investors should question if the company can attract top-tier candidates, as Morgan Stanley's representative on the Q3 FY '19 earnings call may have indirectly hinted at when asking ""what will be different"" about the CEO search this time around. Beyond having their work cut out for them, any CEO candidate will certainly be aware that Mr. Lund effectively laid blame for the company's performance challenges in FY '19 at the feet of Mr. Ratzesberger on the earnings call, even if he tried to do it in a polite way. That fact, coupled with the current state of the business, presents a professional risk to any individual considering the top job.Overall, Teradata seems to be surrounded by a ""perfect storm"" of sorts. Customers - existing and potential - appear to exhibit signs of fatigue with its technology portfolio; its much-hyped transformation has resulted in a majority stream of a recurring revenue characterized by significantly lower profitability; past spending limits its resources to push organic and inorganic growth drivers, and it remains to be seen what caliber of executive the company can successfully recruit as CEO.If the ""perfect storm"" of the previous paragraph is valid, how can we possibly value a company like this? With inconsistent cash flows from operating activities, a traditional DCF model does not initially appear to be of much value:Figure 6.1 Teradata Cash from Operating ActivitiesData Source: Teradata Annual Report FY '16 - FY '18Chart Source: Yves SukhuWith $94MM of cash provided by operating activities for the 9 months ended September 30, 2019, the full-year result for FY '19 will, expectedly, fall substantially below that of FY '18. Thus, what growth rate would even make sense to predict future cash flows? Despite this, perhaps a model can help in another way. I built one out using the following assumptions:Figure 6.2 DCF Model AssumptionsWith these assumptions, I modeled cash flows through 2030 and arrived at a present value per share of $24.78, which is not so far off from where the stock trades today. Thus, we might argue share price levels today are not completely ""whacky"".But, are the assumptions reasonable, particularly in regard to growth? An average cash flow growth rate of 10% is not wholly unreasonable; but given everything that has been discussed thus far, it might be very difficult for some investors to accept.Perhaps I state the obvious saying that I view Teradata stock as a speculative investment at the moment, and I do think it is expensive by the measures mentioned at the beginning of Section 5.0. Short sellers seem to agree with short interest around 14% of float as of this writing. That being said, should the stock drop below $20/share, and into the ""teens"", over the next couple quarters as the company ""figures itself out"", daring investors might consider shares a worthy gamble for a small portion of their portfolio. Even below $20, I am not certain investors have a good margin of safety; it is just a bet that most of the worst are behind the company. But, I reiterate, I am worried the company's problems run deep.I can't help but wonder if Teradata management has been trying to fit the 1980s-1990s strategy into (the latter half of) this decade...and it's just not working. The idea of the integrated data warehouse of that bygone era was driven by limitations of computing technology, supporting the need for such large centralized systems and correspondingly large deal sizes. Certainly, data warehousing is still an important goal for many companies. But, it would be fair to argue that many use cases which once required a data warehouse no longer do because the speed and capabilities of modern computing eliminate the need.Teradata Vantage is the analytics-equivalent of Teradata's legacy data warehouse strategy. The proposition to eliminate analytic silos with an integrated analytics platform is perfectly logical. But, I question if there is a sufficient volume of appropriate use cases for Teradata to grow its transformed business on. I hazard to guess the answer is ""no"". And while I am sure the company would whole-heartedly disagree with me, there is a certain rigidity implied by Vantage. After all, if a customer is committing itself to a centralized approach for its internal analytic services, then obviously requirements must ""flow"" through that platform. However, as much as analytics is about repeatable, well-defined processes, it is also about rapid experimentation and speed-to-answer. Moreover, characteristics of modern computing may not support the same degree of urgency to break down silos, in contrast to the dynamics which drove the data warehouse market of the late 20th century. For example, a given customer today may be perfectly content to duplicate the same analytics system in multiple departments because the cost to do so is tolerable, or even negligible.Maybe Teradata is trying to continue playing the game it knows, but the game has changed too much.I have been thinking, in the back of mind, that Teradata - despite its roots - may attempt to eventually transition away from a product-centric company complemented by strategic consulting to a consulting-centric company complemented by some strategic products. Victor Lund did not hide his frustration on the Q3 FY '19 earnings call, effectively demanding improvement in the company's high-value consulting revenues. A consulting-centric approach would allow Teradata to exploit its many years of accumulated industry-specific knowledge, and focus that knowledge on delivering complex analytic solutions to customers with the best available technologies, some of which may be Teradata and others not. It would allow the company to reduce its COGS and R&D spend, with the commensurate savings directed to development and growth of the consulting organization. Teradata's acquisition of ThinkBig, a Hadoop consultancy, in FY '14 may have been an early step in this direction. Perhaps we may see some moves supporting this theory in FY '20.I would offer to readers that I had the privilege to work alongside some very smart and talented individuals during my tenure at Teradata years ago. I am sure that many such capable technologists, researchers, and other team members remain at the company today. Therefore, despite certain past ""dynamics"" at the company and my bearish point-of-view expressed throughout this report, Teradata's story is likely not done yet.wp_teradata_doing_for_analytics_what_we_did_for_data.pdftdc_q3_fy2019_earnings_summary.pdftdc_ar_fy2018.pdf"
4145857,98236,2018-02-12T18:53:00-05:00,"Teradata reported the results of its full-year and Q4 results last week.The company continued to over-attain prior consensus expectations.Some analysts were unhappy because the company sold too much in the way of product and perpetual license.Some analysts were unhappy with the projection of Q1 seasonality.Overall, the company's turnaround is on track and gathering some momentum.","Last week Teradata (TDC) reported the results of its Q4 operations. Sadly, for the company, the results were reported on a day in which very few eyes were focused on the results of specific enterprises. The software index, the Nasdaq and the S&P, were all busy selling off in dramatic fashion that has lead to numerous headlines regarding the apocalypse or something worse. I think it can be a mistake to read too much into share price performance during the midst of a stock market correction. Investors, for the most part, are looking for reasons to sell and not reasons to buy. In the case of Teradata, what really ought to be viewed as a strong quarter, certainly relative to expectations, mainly served as an excuse to sell the shares aggressively. Part of that related to the syndrome of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” In this case, the shares had been upgraded by both Cowen and Morgan Stanley in the weeks before the earnings release and they had appreciated quite noticeably over the prior three months. All of those gains were wiped away in a couple of days of fevered trading that really had little to do with the company’s actual operational performance.Teradata shares have spent the last couple of years rising from a slough of despair. The shares made a low of about $23 at the start of 2016, in the wake of another of a seemingly endless series of operational miscues. Shortly thereafter, the CEO was replaced, and the company embarked on an operational turnaround. While the turnaround is still very much a work in progress, Q4 did mark the end of headline declines in reported revenues, which at $626 million were significantly above prior consensus expectations of $611 million. The company bettered prior consensus EPS expectations by a significant amount as well, after excluding the specific impacts of the new corporate tax law as regards to repatriation of overseas cash balances.TDC shares were obviously caught up in the turmoil that marked last week’s trading. On the other hand, the evolution of the share price also was a function of perceived quarterly performance and guidance weaknesses. That's simply not a valid conclusion to draw from the numbers and the guidance that the company presented. As it happens, the company has increased its expectations quite markedly for 2018, especially when considering the negative impact of the adoption of ASC 606 revenue standards coupled with a rather rapid pace of migration to subscription revenue sources. Overall, the company is anticipating that its subscription/cloud revenue growth will exceed 100% this year. Despite this mix swing, which ceteris paribus, might be anticipated to have a negative impact on margins, the company is now forecasting EPS in the range of $1.50-$1.60. That exceeds the prior consensus EPS forecast for the year.Management suggested that it would continue to embark on a program of strategic investments, much of which would impact Q1 operating expense. Further, the company accrues tax rates based on quarterly operating performance, and thus its forecast tax rate for Q1 is several hundred basis points above its estimate of a full-year tax rate. As a result, it guided Q1 earnings to a level of $.13-$.16, significantly below the prior Q1 EPS consensus which had been $.25. Presumably, it was this Q1 earnings guidance that lead to some of the sell-off in the shares on Thursday and Friday. Will earnings actually be that constrained forecast in Q1? I think the guidance was probably prudent more than a completely accurate representation of expectations. It may be that the exceptional license revenue performance in Q4 “stole” a bit of potential Q1 performance, although that's hard to determine from the conference call. It may be that the company will achieve strong ACV metrics in this quarter without seeing much of a benefit in reported revenues as its transition to subscription accelerates. But it is less than logical to downgrade expectations for this company, overall, because it succeeded in selling lots of perpetual business in Q4. I can’t imagine that those negative observers would suggest that the company turn back the perpetual business that it sold.The company suggested that its “funnel” had increased by more than 100% year over year. Of course, that statistic, out of context, may or may not be significant. Pipeline evaluation is never straightforward, and without some data regarding the historical pattern of close rates, it is hard to draw much by way of specifics from conclusions from the growth of the funnel. That said, however, and again in the context of the reaction of the shares to the earnings release, it does seem as though the company is seeing its newer offerings resonate significantly with customers who have a long history of buying from TDC. One of the aspects of trying to evaluate a company in transition to a ratable earnings model is that there has been no reasonable way for any company embarking on a course from on-premise to a ratable business model to accurately estimate the cadence of user demand for ratable consumption models. Just based on the historical experience of many other technology vendors moving from traditional consumption models to cloud/subscription alternatives, and given the forecasts that the company has provided regarding its own transition, I think the operating outlook should most appropriately be regarded as a substantial attainment. Typically, when companies see such large growth in cloud/subscription revenues (the company is forecasting such growth at in excess of 100%), they can rarely sustain operating margins, and often fall into a loss-making paradigm for quarters or even years. Teradata has been able to avoid that particular issue because such a substantial component of its revenues come from services which include both consulting and maintenance.The company doesn't specifically report maintenance revenues and even its new disclosures will not include a specific line for support. I have tried to provide my own calculation in that regard, but without substantiation from the company it is just an estimate. Maintenance revenues apparently represented about $185 million or 29.5% of Q4 revenues, and this source of highly profitable revenues has enabled the company to continue to produce positive non-GAAP financial metrics. It appears that cloud/subscription revenues are still a relatively small percentage of the total and their precise trajectory has been a bit murky as TDC does not report that specific number, but just reports the total of recurring revenue. (The cloud revenue percentage apparently declined in Q4 due to the strong seasonality the company experienced in sales of perpetual licenses and hardware which actually increased by 76% sequentially. Cloud and subscription revenues continued to grow sequentially, but at a somewhat smaller rate than in the past, as perpetual transactions “crowded out” some potential cloud revenues in Q4. There were those analysts/observers who said that the success that TDC had in selling perpetual licenses in Q4 was a reason to sell the shares as perpetual license revenue attainment is a negative. That kind of analysis is not worthy of any sustained refutation. As it happens, whatever the specific course of cloud/subscription revenues, cloud/subscription bookings were particularly strong last quarter which can be seen in the progression of long-term deferred revenues.)At this point, management hasn’t quantified the precise level of cloud/subscription revenues and trying to calculate their level based on the data reported doesn’t lead to realistic numbers. The company is planning to provide additional metrics to outline its financial performance including ARR, percentage of subscription bookings and what's called TCore growth (a measure of physical consumption of Teradata solutions based on both storage and compute metrics). The company has forecast overall ARR growth of 10% in this current year and it expects about half of its bookings will be structured as subscriptions. It does not plan to specifically report cloud/software revenues which this writer feels would be a helpful addition to the overall disclosure package.What can be said about the company’s actually performance in Q4 was that it was strong and significantly greater than expectations. Product revenue bookings showed strength, and if the company provided metrics to calculate product bookings they would almost certainly show substantial growth. Subscription revenues continued to rise.The company gave guidance that may have been mis-construed during the massive sell-off as disappointing with regard to Q1. In fact, the company is still in the midst of its transition and it makes it difficult to project specific quarterly performance. Overall, the guidance the company has provided suggests that the new consumption offerings are resonating with customers and TDC has started to return to growth and to financial health.For readers perhaps unfamiliar with TDC, the company has been a pioneer in the space now called data analytics - really from the time before there was such a defined space. The company, an offspring of NCR (NCR), initially developed a specialized database to store information in a form that's more efficient for users such as retailers than a traditional RDMS. Over the course of a decade, the company has squandered its first mover advantage, first by resisting the trend toward data appliances which proved to be more efficient for many workloads than a traditional enterprise data warehouse, and then being terribly late to the cloud party. It might be an interesting case study to determine how all of those decisions got made, but it really doesn’t matter to investors searching for positive alpha at this point. Indeed, it seems that the company’s past under-performance has heavily influenced analyst recommendations to the point where valuations are more compressed for TDC than would otherwise be the case, affording investors a reasonable valuation and entry point.Teradata offers solutions in what Gartner defines as four discrete use cases within the data warehousing space. As can be seen by the study linked here, the company is the leader in each of the four use cases identified by Gartner. The company achieved very high scores in the user survey for its functionality and its customers are exceptionally loyal. While it may not be well recognized, the company is actually a leader in its offerings of all of the distros of Hadoop and both Aster Analytics and TDC Consulting are considered leaders in their respective fields as well.I am, to be sure, not in a position in which I can evaluate all of the elements of the company’s strategic plan. I think it is straightforward to imagine that the company actually does offer functional advantages when compared to its competitors since it has a mature and long-standing focus in a single area. The company has been making outsize investments in consulting services for some time at this point. Presumably, it has been able to add on to its capabilities in this area and is in a position to offer its users solutions that do not turn their world upside down.The Teradata Everywhere strategy basically offers the company’s users a broad range of analytical functionality, that can be deployed anywhere, bought using almost any consumption option and can be moved to any available user platform. Because of the way it has been structured, it de-risks choices for users who don’t have to guess about making a commitment that might be invalidated based on experience. Software license portability is a key feature of the company’s offering and this is a key differentiator that the company is able to offer. It is this flexibility covered with the company’s longstanding functional advantages that have enabled the company to start winning more new name accounts than in the past. While third-party consultants are not always accurate in their prognostications, they certainly provide users with some reasonable guideposts in determining the company’s competitive positioning. Teradata is starting to achieve revenue growth because current users are essentially storing more and processing larger analytical workloads and because it continues to capture new users. While Teradata is simply not going to capture hundreds of new customers each quarter, it has been able both to maintain its customer base and to achieve large, new-name account transactions at an accelerating rate since it started to offer new consumption options. Some recent wins include Mercado Libre (NASDAQ:MELI), the leading Latin American e-commerce vendor Wal-Mart (WMT) where the company is a primary vendor of data visualization solutions, and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which uses Teradata for a variety of different customer call center solutions. The company is large deal centric and is likely to remain that way in the foreseeable future.The CAGR of the market in which TDC competes is said by observers to be at or above 10% with total revenues of above $200 billion by 2021. Obviously, very few observers think that TDC is going to achieve double-digit growth of 10% or more at any time in the near future. But given the company’s technology, its user base and its revised business model, I really do not see any reason why the company cannot return to double-digit growth as its transformation reaches an inflection point.At one point, when this company was selling what was essentially commodity hardware at very high prices, TDC was a very profitable company. Those days are in the past and not likely to return. Users are simply unlikely to be willing to pay a substantial mark-up for storage, still a basic component of what TDC sells, whether or not it is used in a data warehouse. I suspect that part of the negative perception of this company on the part of most analysts relates to the change in its business model to one that's far more software centric and doesn’t relate to prior sources of profitability.That is not to say that the company doesn’t continue to sell hardware. It continues to offer appliances, storage based on all flash arrays, integrated processing nodes in what it describes as IntelliBase, and basically all the other permutations and combinations that most users need to consider for either an enterprise or a departmental analytics solution. But these days, lots of Teradata is being deployed in both the public cloud and in a hybrid cloud environment, which means over time that the company is likely to evolve to a far more software-centric business model.Last quarter, TDC reported gross margins of 49%, down about 140 basis points year-on-year. Gross margin comparisons were buoyed by stronger demand for perpetual license and product transactions which have higher gross margins in the quarter in which they are consummated.In Q4, the company’s selling, general and administrative expense line grew sequentially and was up about 6% year-on-year. That was mainly a function of higher commission expenses due to greater than anticipated sales activity. The company has grown its research and development function quite substantially over the past year. Overall, research and development grew over 30% year-on-year in Q4 even though that expense category was down sequentially.Operating expense in Q4 was close to 40% of revenues, up by more than 500 basis points year-on-year. Income from operations was 9.4% of revenues on a GAAP basis last quarter, down more than 600 bps year-on-year. The company is expecting to reach a nadir in terms of reported margin percent in the coming year, with opex rising 3%-4% and reported revenues flat to up 2%. As the transition to recurring revenue streams continues, margin growth should be substantial. The company hasn’t provided a steady state business model target which would be helpful, but part of the case for investing in these shares relates to the likely gain in operating margins beyond 2018.Teradata’s use of stock-based compensation is quite small and has remained consistent for some time at this point. Overall stock-based comp is less than 3% of revenues. The company recognized its repatriation tax obligation last quarter which has skewed GAAP net income and EPS calculations, but the company is now projecting a full-year tax accrual of 20%, which would be down substantially from the 2017 full-year, non-GAAP tax rate of 28%. The company’s lower tax rate is a significant factor in the higher EPS guidance the company has projected for the current fiscal year.Teradata’s valuation remains in deep-value territory. The company has 124 million shares outstanding and at the current share price, it has a market cap of $4.3 billion. The company has a net cash position of $551 million, leaving an enterprise value of $3.8 billion. With a sales projection of $2.2 billion for this current year, the EV/S is about 1.7X, one of the lowest of such metrics in the IT space.The company is forecasting EPS of $1.60 this year, non-GAAP although stock-based comp is still just a small component of earnings. At that level of earnings, the P/E is 22X, but that's with operating margins that are highly constrained due to the company’s transition. The opportunity the company has to restore its margins from less than 3% of revenues that the company is projecting for the current year is one of the more intriguing components of this story.At this point, TDC is not a cash flow story, per se. That said, however, as the company gets further along with its transition, it would not be surprising to see deferred revenue balances escalate significantly. Last quarter, the company saw a rather substantial increase in deferred revenues year-on-year. Much of that was a very sharp increase in long-term deferred revenue which rose dramatically during the quarter and reflects longer term product subscription arrangements which were prepaid. The company’s forecast for cash flow in this current year does not really reflect any continued expansion of this item - if it happens, TDC will start to generate substantial levels of cash in excess of reported non-GAAP income in short order.TDC remains in the midst of a transition. That said, there's substantial evidence that the company has regained its position and that its new strategies in terms of both products and consumption options, and in particular TDC Everywhere are resonating with its customer base. While the end-point of the transition is still a few years into the future, reported financial results are probably at a nadir at the moment and are likely to improve going forward. The company’s attainment of selling a substantial level of on-premise deals last quarter was real enough, and its Q1 guidance is more prudent than a representation of operational issues. Owning TDC shares except for a recent 3-4 months stretch has produced much positive alpha. I expect that as the dust settles with regard to the quarter and the company’s forward guidance, investors will see a bit more to like and start to reward the shares commensurately."
4145396,103480,2018-02-10T08:37:02-05:00,"Teradata, the big data analytics company that has stagnated for quite some time, returned to flat y/y growth in Q4.Its performance nearly mirrors that of its biggest rival IBM, which also posted its first quarter of growth in years.While Teradata is no longer an exciting growth stock, it has become a massively cash-flowing business with an increasing base of subscription revenues.While startups will likely capture much of the growth in big data products, Teradata will also see modest lift from secular trends toward data-driven management.","For a long time, Teradata (NASDAQ: TDC), the decades-old big data analytics company, has flown under the radar and fallen off investors' wish lists. Like one of its biggest rivals, IBM (NYSE: IBM), Teradata has struggled to reinvent itself as its product offerings grew stale and IT buyers turned to more agile SaaS solutions from newer Silicon Valley startups.Though Teradata is up in the high single digits over the past twelve months, its ~7% appreciation lags far behind the robust appreciation in the S&P Software Index (NYSE: XSW), which is up nearly 20% even after the early February selloff. Clearly, most investors are betting that Teradata will go the way of the dodo.TDC data by YChartsBut is this a fair assessment? Clearly, the company's technology is still worth something, or its customers would have already peeled off to more cloud-agile solutions either from startups or from big-name players like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL), which have in recent quarters successfully re-jiggered their business models to tailor to the cloud. Teradata, too, has been slowly adapting to the ""new normal"" in technology and now offers flexible deployment options, for customers who want to deploy in their own DCs, in the public cloud, or in a mixture of both (the hybrid cloud).Teradata is an old-fashioned technology company, but its current flagship offering - big data analytics - is just now getting into its groove, as enterprises increasingly turn to data-driven management decisions and treat data as a real business asset. Teradata offers a whole slew of backend data solutions, from data warehousing to traditional and new-format databases to analytics that can drive powerful insights from this data.And despite perceptions that Teradata is no longer ""in fashion"" - Gartner, the leading technology industry analyst, has ranked Teradata in its Leaders quadrant (the highest ranking slot) in its annual Magic Gartner Quadrant for Data Management Solutions for Analytics as recently as February 2017. Such distinction speaks volumes to would-be clients and indicates the resilience of its business. Teradata, in this ranking, is stacked up neck-and-neck against Oracle, with Microsoft, IBM, SAP (NYSE: SAP) and Amazon AWS (NASDAQ: AMZN) trailing behind it.And perhaps alone among software companies, Teradata is reasonably valued at 22x forward P/E and 2x forward revenues. Of course, the company's slow-growth status is baked into these modest valuations, but given that investors are in a ""risk-off"" attitude toward highly valued stocks, Teradata has a chance to shine, especially if its earnings results continue to hold up.TDC PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsTeradata longs breathed a sigh of relief when the company returned to breakeven in Q4. Longtime laggard IBM also returned to growth in its most recent quarter after 23 straight quarters of stagnation, but that was due primarily to heavy investments in its AI/ML/IBM Watson capabilities. It was a strong indicator to see that Teradata could pull off the same.Teradata posted $626 million in revenues in 4Q17, exactly flat y/y. This bucks a sorry trend for the company which had Q3 revenues declining 5% (from $552 million to $526 million) and full-year FY17 revenues, in which revenues declined 7% y/y to $2.16 billion from $2.32 billion in FY16.Figure 1. Teradata revenuesSource: Teradata investor relationsAnalysts weren't expecting Teradata's slump to let up so soon. They had penciled in revenues of $610.5 million on average, or a decline of 3%.It's also important to recognize just how massive Teradata's revenue has become - so in a sense, its slow growth is somewhat excusable (though decline is not). Machine data leader Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK) is smaller than Teradata at a ~$1.5 billion run rate; fellow data analytics company Tableau (NYSE:DATA) is even smaller at a $1 billion run rate. Tableau, too, is seeing flat top-line progress as the company shifts billings to its SaaS-based Tableau Online offering.Teradata isn't playing offense anymore, it's defending the business it already has. And from seeing the flat growth in Q4 after a year of stagnation, it's safe to say the company is succeeding.For FY18, Teradata is guiding to $2.15-$2.20 billion in revenues - hinting at a continuation of the flat revenue trend with a chance for a sprinkling of growth. This is backed by Gartner expectations for a lift in software IT spending in 2018. The company still has plenty of opportunity to overachieve relative to its guidance, and from the sheer fact that Wall Street expectations for a no-growth company are so muted, Teradata has plenty of opportunity to surprise to the upside.Another salient feature of Teradata is its profitability, which is rare among technology companies - and software in particular. Profit margins did compress this year as the company re-invested back into the business to revive growth (GAAP operating margins compressed to 9.4% from 15.7% in the prior year).Teradata's GAAP net income results are a bit noisy due to the fact that one-time tax charges related to the Trump tax bill put a temporary damper on EPS, but its pro forma EPS - backing out these one-time items - of $0.58 beat analyst consensus by $0.51.Teradata also has huge cash generation capabilities. Like operating margins, Teradata's operating and free cash flows took a bit of a breather in 2017 as the company focused on reviving its core business, but the expectation of stabilized (or slow-growing) revenues in 2018 should allow the company to expand its cash flow margins again. And it's important to note that Teradata's FCF is still quite sizable for the software industry.Free cash flow for 2017 was $237 million. At Teradata's current market cap of $4.2 billion, the company is trading at just an 18x P/FCF ratio - a far cheaper multiple than its P/E ratio. And with $1.1 billion of cash and $718 million of debt, the company is in a net cash position with an enterprise value of $3.8 billion - so its EV/FCF multiple is just 16x. Not too outrageous for an expensive market.Figure 3. Teradata FCFSource: Teradata investor relationsNote also that Teradata is hinting at decent earnings expansion in FY18. The company posted $1.35 in pro forma EPS in FY17, but is guiding to $1.50-$1.60 in FY18, a growth range of 11% to 18% on the earnings front. In light of its flat revenue guidance, this means the company will be achieving earnings growth through the margin improvements that it neglected in FY17.Don't leave Teradata for dead just yet. The company has returned to breakeven revenues faster than analysts were expecting, and its forecasts for 2018 paint a robust picture of continued revenue stabilization and earnings growth.With a modest valuation of 16x EV/FCF - based on historical free cash flow, and not factoring in the possible free cash flow growth that the company could see in FY18 - as well as under 2x revenues, Teradata's fundamentals have advanced to the point where its low multiples may be too hard to ignore. Further market tremors may cause further drops in the stock, which opens up a fantastic buying opportunity in a scalable software franchise."
4046475,98236,2017-02-15T19:19:41-05:00,"Last week, TDC reported the results of Q4 and for its 2016 year.The results were a significant beat in terms of reported EPS while reported revenues were consistent with the prior consensus.Revenue guidance for the current quarter was a bit ahead of prior expectations; EPS guidance was more or less consistent.The company is not providing full-year guidance because of the many unknowns involved in its transition.Investing in TDC's shares is all about evaluating both the speed and success of the transformations it is trying to achieve. If successful, the rewards to investors will be significant.","Teradata - Handicapping the Start of a PartyI have written about Teradata (NYSE:TDC) several times over the past year. I first wrote about the company and the start of its transition a bit more than a year ago, and while it seems surprising to recount, the shares have appreciated by about 35% since that point. That compares to the 46% appreciation of IGV over the same span. It can be hard to recollect just how harsh the correction in tech shares was a year ago, and how strongly they have appreciated since that point. The QQQs have ""only"" appreciated 33% over the past year.It is far easier for many analysts, as opposed to commentators on this site, to write favorable reports on fast-growing cloud companies. There is to a greater or lesser extent, far less intellectual energy involved in recommending a company growing at 30% than recommending the shares in a company whose revenues are shrinking. The problem for investors with the share price appreciation seen by many of these leading companies in the past year is that many of them have little real potential for positive alpha and create requirements for ever-escalating valuation metrics. Running very hard to stay in the same place so to speak.A positive element for investors in considering Teradata's shares regardless of any other factor is that valuation metrics are not particularly stretched at the current time and one might fairly call them compressed. Of course, the other side of that equation is that investors, perhaps, need to suspend disbelief that there is a new life for this company. Many observers are unwilling to do that.And like many of these transitions, it is inevitable that the evidence one has to consider is more than a bit murky and subject to differing interpretations. I think I see signs of spring. Other observers believe they see signs of a late season blizzard. The weather forecast from my iPhone for this weekend around here is really for unseasonable warmth - one day is supposed to reach 60F. Perhaps it is the same for TDC's shares.Part of the difference in outlook is perspective. TDC is an older company that is not perceived as a leader in its space in terms of its solutions. I think the evidence there is a bit more straightforward that it is a formidable competitor and that its strategy will see it with an increasingly competitive set of solutions.The company was one of the pioneers in big data and analytic solutions and then became unresponsive to some of the more significant market trends over the past few years. I can't say I really know why that was so, nor does it much matter, as the company replaced its CEO and has a new team of senior leaders in most key spots as I documented in prior articles.A few months ago, the company held an analyst meeting and discussed its transformation plan in some level of detail. Either analysts didn't believe that the company would achieve its goals or they felt that the goals were inadequate or would take too long to realize. The shares sold off in the wake of the meeting and have been mainly marking time over the past few months. The shares have participated to some degree in the ""Trump"" market and did enjoy a positive response to the most recent earnings release. But I am still inclined to believe that the preponderance of opinion on the part of both analysts and investors regarding TDC is that it is a has-been company whose best days are behind it.At one time, Teradata was the ""go to"" vendor in its space. While there have always been competitors, the company was able to amass a solid base of users who were very happy with the company's Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) offering.These days the company faces loads of competitors of various stripes and sizes. The business results of the past several years during which the company has gone backward have convinced some analysts and investors that TDC has lost its relevance in the market. That really hasn't been the case.Gartner has TDC comfortably in the leader's quadrant of its product analysis for data warehousing and data management solutions for analytics along with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and SAP (NYSE:SAP). The Forrester Wave study on enterprise data warehouses reaches the same conclusion. TDC has a core of loyal users who have been looking for the company to provide the appropriate solutions in order refresh their installed technology. The new management team is apparently taking the steps necessary to become a responsive partner with its installed base, and some signs that its initiatives are making progress were visible last quarter.It is inevitable in writing about this space that one mentions the cloud. The advent of the cloud was one amongst several factors in upending Teradata's business model, and the failure of the company to respond promptly was a principle factor in costing the former CEO his job. AWS is a significant competitor in the EDW market, but TDC nowadays offers a solution set that incorporates its technology on AWS. At this point, it seems that TDC and AWS have evolved a reasonable co-option model.But we are still a long way from the start of a party to celebrate the return of the company to growth. The odds are that headline numbers are going to show minimal progress this year, although it is possible that the company will see some significant growth in either bookings or deferred revenues or some of the other metrics that are important to investors during transitions from on-premise and perpetual streams of revenue to a ratable model.There are not all that many ways that investors can participate in the market for data warehousing and data management solutions for analytics. Some observers want to lump Tableau (NYSE:DATA) and MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) as well as Qlik Technologies (NASDAQ:QLIK) in the group, and some investors have gone along with that analysis. In the market well, it simply isn't quite happening that way. The reason that IBM, Oracle and SAP are in the leader's quadrant has to do with the business intelligence leaders that they bought a decade ago, and Microsoft has been developing Power BI for more than a decade now. The only other company in the space was Actuate that was bought a bit more than two years ago by Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX). There are reasons to buy OTEX's shares - its ownership of Actuate is a minor component of that investment case.The market for data warehouse revenues and associated analytics is large and continues to grow at low-double-digit rates. Most market research companies nowadays look at big data, analytics and EDW as a combined market. It is really the market space available to TDC. That represents a potential TAM for the company of $200 billion.TDC has always been a specialist company in that space, and while it may have lost its way in the past couple of years, it hasn't lost its customers who remain exceptionally loyal. TDC ran off the rails and lost share because of an unwillingness to sell solutions in the space packaged the way users wanted to buy and not because of something that went wrong with its technology, or even of its support. One of the things that can happen to market leaders is that they grow complacent and sloppy. TDC was slow in selling what are called data appliances in the market for fear that doing so would upset its very profitable EDW business. When the cloud came, it was slow to offer solutions that delivered for its users using that architecture. It has paid a substantial price for those miscues.Rather than looking back, it is more relevant to attempt to determine if the company has a reasonable opportunity to grow at rates consistent with the overall market. In addition, one needs to look at both the profit implications of the company's strategy and the length of time the transition can be reasonably expected to take. Investors bid up TDC's shares 10% last week in the wake of the quarterly results. I believe that the results were a sign-post that some components of the company's strategy are gaining traction. The positive alpha implications that would be inherent in the company reestablishing its position in the EDW/Analytics market are more than significant. It is worth taking a detailed look at both the quarter and the guidance to see what has been happening at the companyAn Early Sighting of Spring?Last week, Teradata reported the results of the end of its fiscal year. The headline numbers included a noticeable earnings beat and a negligible miss in terms of reported revenues (less than 0.5%) that was a product of a combination of FX headwinds coupled with a more rapid cadence in its customers moving to ratable revenue alternatives. The company did not provide full-year guidance primarily based on its judgment that it had an inability to forecast with any precision just how much the ratable mix is going to grow the current year. Given the rather inaccurate forecasts that have been a hallmark of similar transitions throughout the IT space, this is a prudent tack.I would be happier if the company would choose to introduce a bookings metric as part of its set of forecasting metrics but that has not yet happened. The company is introducing other metrics to track progress in terms of revenue proxies. One of these is something called T-Cores, which the company has developed as a tool for measuring the consumption of its products (The company defines T-Cores as both physical CPU cores as well as throughput for its systems). The company is also going to introduce an ARR metric. Shipments of T-Cores apparently started to grow in Q4 compared to declines earlier in the year. The company said it expected to see decent growth in the ARR metric this current year; it probably was flat based on what was said during the call during Q4. While TDC has consumption options that span the gamut between on-prem to public cloud and all the way in between, it is expecting that most of its large deals in the future are likely to be based on hybrid cloud deployments.The company forecast Q1 revenues of $500 million, noticeably greater than the pre-announcement consensus expectation of $486 million with an EPS of $.25-.30, consistent with the prior EPS forecast of $.30 for the quarter. Because of the company's historic track record in terms of making numbers, the potential impact of the transition and the lack of more than one quarter of guidance, the dispersion of estimates is far greater than is usually seen for a company of this scale. What can be gleaned from the forecasts, however, is that the consensus simply doesn't believe the transformation project is likely to be successful - not this year and not in 2018 either.Most analysts are not particularly enchanted with the opportunity here, a function of terminal ""backward lookingness"" I believe. 23 analysts report their ratings to First Call. Of Those 23, 14 have hold ratings, another five rate the shares as underperform and a couple rate the shares as a sell. That leaves just a couple of lonely buy ratings of which the most prominent is offered by JMP. While the present consensus price target is less than the current price of the shares, the ratings suggest that there is enormous upside if this transition succeeds, most likely significantly greater than more fashionable names in the cloud space that sport valuations to match the consensus view.In Q4, the company reported revenues of $$626 million, a decline of 13% from the level reported in Q4 2015. The company divested its marketing application business this year so the apples-to-apples comparison was a decline of 8% and 7% in constant currency. That probably doesn't look much like any early spring investors are looking for.The cost side of the equation did exhibit strong positive trends, but as the saying goes, no one ever saved their way to prosperity. From my perspective, the investment case for TDC is not that the company is being right-sized, but that the company will be able to grow going forward. That being said, selling, general and administrative expense on a GAAP basis dropped by 25% year on year, far greater than the 13% reduction in reported revenues. Selling, general and administrative expense was flat sequentially despite normal seasonality. Overall, reported revenues rose $74 million (that is really just seasonality at this point) while selling general and administrative costs remained at Q3 levels and likely will decline further going forward.On the Q4 conference call, the company CFO talked about $40 million of bookings during the quarter that will be recognized ratably. Of course, we don't know what that $40 million compares to a year earlier and the length of time over which the revenues will be recognized. But overall, it seems likely that Q4 results in terms of bookings were consistent on an apples-to-apples basis with the results reported for Q4 2015. That level of results is better than the results the company has achieved in the past several quarters.The company is forecasting that it will achieve revenues of $500 million in Q1, net of $50 million of transactions that will be ratable. This is an awkward way of communicating that kind of metric when compared to how other companies in similar transitions choose to report their results. But if that $50 million forecast turns out to be the right number, it will be 20%+ of product bookings for the period. In any event, I would be surprised if the cadence of the swing to ratable transactions turns out to be that modest. I think it is more likely that the swing will be similar to that experienced by PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) in recent quarters, although that really is more of a guess than anything else.As mentioned earlier, the company is planning on providing a new metric called T-core which is a standard unit of consumption of Teradata product solutions. T-Core is a bit of a made-up number because this company sells both database capacity and analytics, and it is unknown how analytics are converted into T-Cores. The company noted that T-Core started grow in Q4 at ""a good rate after declines in Q1, Q2, and Q3.""Again, as mentioned above, the company is planning on providing an ARR metric which is forecast to grow in the high-single digits this year. Given that services revenue, which includes maintenance, is such a large component of revenue at this point, a high-single-digit growth rate in ARR will be a significant attainment that would probably lead to a significant re-rating of the shares by many observers. The company expects to increase the recurring portion of its revenue from 43% to the high 40s percent over the course of 2017.All the Moving Parts Anyone Could Want to TrackI am not too sure if anyone would want to read about all the moving parts that made up the latest TDC earnings release. Far too many, really. But I will try to highlight a few that might be of some use to readers trying to evaluate the potential for the shares of this company going forward. The net of this for those not disposed to read the balance is that there are going to be lots of cross currents and countervailing forces that are going to be tugging on earnings. The headline numbers to a greater or lesser extent will not mean much. There will probably be some specific proxies that help in evaluating the progress of the turnaround. Last quarter showed some green shoots with regards to sales and the consumption of T-Cores. Most everything else is really on the come.I think the most important concept to note is that the company is focused on increasing the consumption of T-Cores at a dramatic rate over the next few years. The company has an aspirational CAGR in that regard is about 30%. There are several ways in which the company is attempting to realize that objective.One of these is the variety of consumption options that have been developed. Users can obtain Teradata solutions just about any way they want them. Teradata offers its database as a service, it offers it as a managed service option, it offers backup/recovery systems, and it offers the service in a private cloud, on AWS and on Azure. It also offers what it calls workload-specific prices that are designed to offer additional flexibility for users that want to use Hadoop or want to user an analytics appliance, or hybrid storage. The company these days offers just about any possible combination of options for ware housing data or analyzing the data in those warehouses.The net of these options in business terms is to try to increase the recurring revenue contribution for TDC. The company is forecast that recurring revenues will increase from 61% of its revenues in 2016 to 86% of revenues by 2019. That kind of transformation will ultimately lead to a more stable business model with greater profit margins.The company is planning to grow research and development expense significantly over the next couple of years through 2019. In that regard, it is opening a new development center in Seattle and significantly expanding its other research and development operations. Overall, development spending is likely to increase by 50% or more over the next couple of years.Presumably the outcome from the spending will be a broader portfolio that can more deeply penetrate the company's larger clients on which it is planning to concentrate its sales efforts. Much of the effort is going to be focused on providing users with more efficient hybrid cloud solutions and providing potential customers with new analytic solutions.Because these permutations and combinations are for more comprehensive and complex than what the company has chosen to offer in the past, it has made it difficult to draw trends from demand for one or the other sets of TDC consumption/revenue streams.Part of the company's strategy that is going to impact near-term financials relates to its focus on altering its consulting business so that it is primarily related to developing analytic solutions and developing big data architecture for its clients. I commented that this is not a trivial undertaking and one whose future is somewhat difficult to forecast. Consulting services, as opposed to maintenance, were about 1/3rd of total revenues when it was last reported specifically. That proportion probably hasn't changed materially in the last few quarters. It is not a trivial component of the TDC business mix, and it is a key part of the company's strategy.As the transition accelerates in scope, there will be stresses in terms of gross margins in the consulting area. The company is going to have to recruit and train higher cost individuals for its new consulting focus and they are likely to have a lower utilization rate in the short term than the individuals they are essentially replacing. Services margins were consistent on a GAAP basis last quarter compared to Q4 2015, but they probably will not be able to sustain that level in 2017.There is a new FASB rule (606) that will have to be implemented either this year or next. As a practical matter, it could impact to some extent the way a company like TDC recognizes on-prem revenue by requiring the purchase price of a contract to be tied to specific performance obligations in a contract. I do not propose to get into a detailed discussion regarding the impact of implementing 606 for this company; it is coming, it will have a noticeable impact, and investors are likely to shrug off any revenue deferrals that it creates. It is just another moving part of the company's reported financials.ValuationValuing a company in the midst of a molt is a difficult exercise. The molt produces some peculiar valuation metrics that aren't representative of anything in particular and really don't help in assessing the worth of a company. This is going to be one of those times.For the record, however, Teradata reported outstanding shares at the end of last year of 132 million. At the current share price of $31.57, that yields a market capitalization of $4.16 billion. Net cash on the balance sheet is a bit more than $400 million, which yields an enterprise value of $3.7 billion. The current First Call consensus forecast for revenues this year is $2.13 billion, down 8% from the revenues for 2016 just reported and consistent with guidance. That produces an EV/S of a bit over 1.7X and is indicative of the current attitude towards this company held by investors. It does, however, suggest that the company has a valuation that could readily attract interest from potential P/E buyers.The company, as indicated elsewhere, is not providing EPS guidance for the year. The consensus number for EPS of $1.43 is probably consistent with the revenue forecast. Actual earnings for TDC are going to be very dependent on the cadence of the revenue transition to ratable sources. The faster the transition, the lower the earnings. Ironically, the faster the growth in T-Cores consumed on a ratable basis, the lower the earnings. The P/E of 22X based on the First Call consensus is really not indicative of much and should not be used in trying to value the shares.Despite all of the uncertainties, the company is forecasting free cash flow of $250 million this current year. Management feels that cash flow for the year is very front-end loaded and more than 60% will be produced in Q1. Needless to say, $250 million is a very depressed number and compares to free cash flow generation of $333 million last year (based on my definition which includes net capex as well as net additions to capitalized software). But even at the compressed level of free cash flow being forecast, TDC's free cash flow yield is almost 6.8%.I think that the net that can be said of the valuation metrics is that they are very low, and that despite the fact that the company's numbers are at trough levels. Trough valuations off of trough operating numbers can be a formula for very powerful appreciation.In looking at the IT universe these days, it is fair, I think, to observe that many of the ""traditional"" of the recent hyper-growth names have valuations that in whole or in part reflect the most likely course of their future operational performance. It is hard to obtain much positive alpha from a story that is already well recognized.That is not the case for TDC. Basically, no one believes management, and to the extent that it is believed, the cadence of improvement is thought to be too slow. I don't think that is a good way to invest.I am looking for positive alpha. I believe that analytics and data warehousing are two of the better spaces in the IT space. TDC has a far better market position in that niche than is believed. It is molting and is not pretty during the process, but it is my belief that the molt will produce an attractive butterfly. Q1 was a success for the company, and I think this is reasonable entry point for those looking to achieve positive alpha."

Teradata also did not file an 8-K or indicate any change in financial guidance, so it appears the transaction amount was not material to its financial condition.As of Teradata’s March 31, 2017 10-Q, the company had $1.16 billion in cash and equivalents, so although we don’t know the price paid, it is probable that TDC had ample resources to acquire StackIQ without undue financial hardship.Teradata is a recognized industry leader in analytics data management, so the acquisition of StackIQ moves it into cluster provisioning.StackIQ’s system automates and simplifies the process of software deployment across physical and virtual large-scale server clusters, and Teradata plans to integrate it into its Teradata Everywhere system.As Teradata stated in the deal announcement,So, with the new capabilities, Teradata customers won’t have to use an external deployment system; rather, the addition will enable them to deploy Teradata solutions more quickly and easily across hybrid cloud environments and through more functional areas of the enterprise.StackIQ is already handling ‘millions of servers in data centers around the globe,’ so the deal will provide extensive cross-selling opportunities.I view the deal as a definite positive for Teradata, as it makes it easier for clients and prospects to accelerate their adoption of the company’s solutions, which should result in a faster revenue growth.I write about M&A deals, public companies that invest in technology startups and IPOs.

Great excitement and shouts of approbation regarding the results of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). General satisfaction with the results of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). A few naysayers attempting to portray Amazon as a chimera - after 17 years! Loads of interesting investment stories that bear at least some evaluation.So why spend the time to write about a name that many consider to be a ""has been."" Well, at the end of the day, I think that this is a company that is achieving a transformation of some magnitude. But this management lacks credibility, it doesn't really know how to present its story and many analysts who loved Teradata (NYSE:TDC) shares for many years now treat it with a disdain usually accorded to jilted lovers. One analyst who has the shares rated a ""hold"" said in reference to the current quarterly report that the shares ""deserve"" to be down by the 8% they were after the quarterly results were released. Now, I do not think the shares are like some little child in deserving or not deserving anything, but it is a choice of words that betrays a certain point of view.The title of this article comes from a Christmas carol of some note which speaks to context. If you look and try to take an objective viewpoint, the perspective you will have on this company will be quite a bit different than the disdain in which it is held by so many reputedly objective observers.Sometimes in evaluating IT, it is well to note that there is a T out there. Sometimes it might be well to look at metrics a bit more carefully before discarding a company because of its inept communications with shareholders. The title for this segment of the article comes from the lyrics of a famous musical by Rogers & Hammerstein called ""Carousel"". The point I am trying to make is that what's the use of wondering what might happen if the company portrayed itself in a different fashion. It hasn't and I have no idea of when or if it will. In the meantime, it sets up a very interesting opportunity for investors that would never be available if the company did a better job is explaining itself.This is a company that has developed some industry leading solutions in one of the highest growth spaces in the IT firmament. And this is a company with a competitive potential that is as yet dimly perceived and which is only showing the first faint signs of realization. Needless to say, this company is one of the most hated names in the IT space having an average rating based on First Call data of between a hold and a sell.And yet its valuation using standard metrics is, if not deep valuation, pretty close to that. I get it - the company is headquartered in Dayton. (For those readers from Dayton, please forgive my rude and perhaps not so funny eastern sensibilities - but I do think there is an element of truth in that if this company were located either in Boston or in Silicon Valley or better still in SF, it probably would get more respect and a higher share value. Interestingly, its development operations are actually headquartered in San Diego.)There are many styles of tech investing and they are not all mutually exclusive. Some investors are simply looking for the highest growth, and valuation be damned. Others are looking for companies that are perhaps best described as forces of nature who completely dominate their category. Some are looking for deep value in tech or for dusty corners or for controversial turnarounds. There is no one size fits all. I own shares of Amazon and Microsoft and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) all of which are metaphors for different investment styles and see no intellectual dissonance in doing so. Occasionally, I am willing to bottom fish and to be a contrarian. Needless to say, the potential rewards are probably the highest if the thesis works out. And, because this is an environment of active private equity investment in tech, the downside is not as great as might have been the case in earlier years.Teradata as an investment is not likely to make the cut for many investors. But I see massive opportunities because it is really offering one of the better solutions in the big data/analytic space, because it actually has amongst the better consulting capabilities in that space and because it has thousands of very loyal customers. And so far as it goes, I think the Q1 financials have been misinterpreted by many analysts who seem not to recognize patterns or to look for analogies. Let's see if readers agree with the thesis I present in the balance of this article.What did TDC reportJust to review the headlines, TDC reported that revenues for its Q1 2017 were $491 million, down by a bit more than 2% organically. The company reported non-GAAP EPS of $.28, down from $.47 in the prior year. EPS matched prior consensus estimates; revenues were about 1.5% less than prior consensus expectations. The company's cash flow from operations was $248 million, unchanged from the results achieved in the year earlier period.The company, like many others similarly situated, acknowledged that it is difficult to forecast the cadence of its transformation to a business model based on both subscriptions and hosted solutions. It did not and will not, therefore, offer full-year guidance.The company is forecasting Q2 revenues of $520 million and non-GAAP EPS of about $.28 (middle of the range). The prior consensus for the period had been EPS of $.38 and revenues of $530 million. The $520 million of revenues is net of about $30-$40 million of product subscriptions that will be recognized ratably and will not have a material impact on Q2 revenues. Over time, the company is likely to find it necessary to alter its quarterly presentations to forecast bookings that incorporate both the value of subscriptions expressed in terms of license revenues regardless of the revenue type of the booking. The complexity of even describing exactly what the value was of the closed deals that will be recognized ratably was on full display in the quarterly call and apparently led to some fairly ignorant commentary from some analysts.The company did experience bookings growth, although quite a bit of that growth was the result of a single transaction that was for $130 million. The magnitude of that transaction was such as that it eclipsed the company's own expectations for total bookings. The discussion of the single transaction, the value of the transaction in license equivalent terms and the details of what the user is consuming was not the most enlightening component of this earnings presentation. It is a bit of a black comedy when a positive event can be turned into a circus of misunderstanding. Put simply, the company took a howitzer and shot it in the general direction of its feet in its misbegotten effort to describe a major win.Just for comparison, it is worth comparing the discussion of this win to that of a major win by PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) last year. One would have to have been completely without hearing to miss the cheering for that company's $20 million win with a government agency that has yet to be totally finalized. PTC shares were up on that news, this company saw shares fall 8%. That is the punishment for not being able to articulate what is really go on in a company.The nature of transformations is that they take some time to execute. One has only to look at PTC or at Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) or even Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) to see how long it can be before transformations become visible in headline numbers. 2017 was always going to be a year of investment for this company in which the combination of focused hiring coupled with the impact on reported revenues from the transition from selling on-premise solutions to subscription and cloud solutions would hobble reported earnings.There is no particular reason to believe at this point that the company will earn more or less than the current EPS forecast of $1.27 - certainly not because of Q1 results and not because of Q2 guidance. It is not immediately apparent to what extent the specific EPS numbers for 2017 are germane to a discussion of the company's transition any more than are the specific earnings numbers are for PTC or for ADSK or for many other companies in the midst of similar transitions. But for a variety of reasons, some apparent, others shrouded in the mists, analysts are far more unsparing of this company's transitional results than is the case for most other IT vendors.As mentioned, the company added $50 million of subscription based product revenue in the quarter. Again, even after re-reading the transcript and listening to the answers regarding the questions concerning the amount, I am not quite sure exactly what the $50 million relates to, although it appears to be the level of perpetual revenues that were not taken because the customer chose a subscription procurement option. The cadence of revenue recognition for the deal isn't known precisely, and as it happens, the deal really turns out to have been worth $130 million.Overall, the company now has $1 billion of annual recurring revenue, most of which ($700 million+ run rate) is maintenance. The company breaks the balance of its revenue into product and cloud and services. Subscription revenues, cloud and upgrades grew from $70 to $77 million in constant currency in this quarter, so the $50 million has yet to be seen in the actual reported numbers.The company reported that this one transaction, in which a user re-committed to TDC and agreed to TDC spend of $130 million over 5 years, consists of multi-type procurements of T-cores, hardware, software and maintenance. Most other companies would have described this as a mega-deal, compared it to year earlier booking results and bragged about the rapid growth in bookings.Next quarter, the company is forecasting several smaller but still sizeable transactions that will incorporate different kinds of subscription models that will aggregate to $30-$40 million of perpetual license value. If it works out that way, and the rest of the forecast turns out to be valid, the company will be seeing an apples to apples growth of mid-single digits in revenue.The company reports a metric for growth in consumption of its solutions called T-Cores that I described in some detail when I last wrote about this name. T-Core growth was 30% year on year, a significant acceleration compared to prior periods.The company reported that its business consulting revenues grew by 10% last quarter, but total consulting revenues were down 3%. I am not quite sure what the difference between business consulting and just consulting might be. Business consulting is, however, anticipated to be a significant revenue growth driver going forward and it is one focus of the company's rather aggressive hiring undertaking.What's the strategy for TDC - What's it going to cost to get where the company wants to goIt can be painful to listen to and then read a TDC call - especially if you are a shareholder. It is about the same as a tooth extraction or listening to a Trump Tweet. It is as though one needs a translator to extract positive news from senior management. So, the question is, is the pain worth it?I do not propose to reprise the articles I have written trying to detail this company's strategy. People buy from Teradata because it has been an effective way to store and utilize data that can lead to actionable analysis. There are many different ways to describe that and the term in use these days is big data analytics, but the concept has been the same for many years.As has been the case for many years, Teradata remains the highest ranked solution in the category of data management solutions for analytics out of the 20 vendors surveyed by Gartner (see the link). At the very least, I think the report documents that TDC offers solutions that ought to cater to large users who want best of breed in the analytics category. As the study is data as of February 20th, 2017, it depicts current competitive trends.What the study doesn't say, but which might be inferred, is that while TDC has the ""best"" or at least a very competitive solution in its space, it has been the company's inflexibility in terms of licensing terms that has prevented it from achieving at least market rates of growth. That is changing. You can buy Teradata in just about anyway you want - at least if you pay them. At this point, the company has a very broad range of consumption options and is at least as flexible in that regards as anyone else in the business.The company's challenge is to take its installed base and its market opportunity and to execute on the opportunity it has by dint of technology and reputation amongst its users. Its tactics are pretty straightforward. It is going to increase its opex by $100 million, the spend is going to be targeted at enhancing its business consulting services, accelerating the development of specific solution sets and in upgrading its sales operations. I am not totally sure what other strategy might make better sense. Standing still, or continuing to cut opex, is really not an option when a company is not getting the traction it should from its technology. The company needs to find a way of executing more efficiently and the strategy outlined by the company in November has shown one palpable green shoot and has also, according to management, been well received by users.It is probably worth reading what the CEO said on the point.Ok, that is part of the conference call script and as such it is a commercial. I can't evaluate if it is a function of ""happy ears"", an attempt at obfuscation or a reflection of the facts. What was not plain to some observers this time around should be more visible in Q2 and thereafter - but it is surely a process not marked by a dramatic inflection point or an ""ah-ha"" moment.I will close this section by giving the CEO space to express his specific thoughts on a transition. They ring true to me, although that doesn't mean things will happen on script. But I think the paragraph is worth recording.This is very large market - hundreds of billions of dollars of TAM according to this linked report with a CAGR of 12%. The company has a reasonable market position despite its multi-year record of mismanagement and sales inflexibility. It has a plan in place to fix what has ailed it. The company isn't in a bad place from which to launch a turnaround.ValuationOne analyst cited earlier in this report said that TDC shares were richly valued and were, essentially, ahead of themselves. The shares are up 15% over the last year. That compares to 28% appreciation for the software/tech index over the same period. It is more than a bit difficult to maintain that the company's shares are ""ahead of themselves"" given just how far behind the performance of the IGV they have been. Even before this current pullback, the shares were still performing below levels of the IGV - in no sense had investors become giddy about the prospects for this company, at least in terms of share price valuation.At this point, the published First Call consensus is for revenues of $2.1 billion for the current year. I have not seen any changes in estimates thus far, and given the high negative sentiment prior to the earnings release, there isn't much further for sentiment to drop.The company currently has an outstanding share count of 130 million shares and its market price at the close on Friday, April 28th was $29.2. The company's outstanding share count has declined noticeably over the course of several years and management has re-initiated its share buyback program. TDC thus has a current market cap of $3.8 billion. It has a net cash balance of $600 million, most of it held outside of the US. In any event, the company has an enterprise value of $3.2 billion and thus has an EV/S of 1.5X. One of the reasons to own TDC shares is that metric alone. The company is profitable. Revenues are probably at a trough. The space in which the company competes is growing at 12%. It is obvious that no one believes that the company has any relevance to the space and that it will never be able to mount a comeback.But at the current valuation, if it doesn't, it will surely get consolidated - for its technology, for its maintenance base. When VCs look at making money, one metric frequently considered is EV/Maintenance revenue. That metric is 4.6X, a level that could readily support a consolidation transaction.Current consensus earnings expectations are for EPS of $1.27. That number is down pretty substantially over the past 90 days subsequent to the earnings call at the start of the year. What is more than a bit surprising is that the EPS estimate for 2018 have dropped even more significantly and now show little growth from 2017. The illogic of that expectation is rather startling. Management has said it will be investing an extra $100 million of opex this year. With an expected tax rate of 27%, that $100 million represents EPS of $.56.Half of that $100 million in opex is coming just in the R&D area which is a massive increase considering that the GAAP run rate of research and development spending was at $280 million last quarter. Without trying to over-stress the point, either the turnaround will start to produce some kind of palpable results in terms of revenue/bookings generation over the next year, or the company is likely to pare back expenditures and try to sell itself. The odds that it will have comparable EPS in 2018 to the level it reports this year is pretty minimal.But regardless, with EPS almost certainly at a trough level, the projected P/E for this year is 23X. I am not sure how much that metric really means or should be used to arrive at an investment conclusion, but compared to many other companies in transition, the P/E is at a very reasonable level.The company generated $248 million of cash flow from operations (CFFO) last quarter. The company has a minimal level of stock-based comp. expense (6% of CFFO). More than half of the company's CFFO came from increases in deferred revenue balances and that increase was a bit higher than that metric in the year earlier quarter. It is not known if any of the deferred revenues may have come from the company's mega-transaction.The company doubled capex in the current quarter compared to a year ago. In all, capex was $16 million leading to free cash flow for the period of $230 million. Despite the strong levels of cash flow the company generated in Q1, it is forecasting that for the year, free cash flow will be in the range of $250 million. Some of the constraint on cash flow will be due to a much higher level of capex that will be needed to support managed cloud and hybrid cloud offerings.Again, the company's forecast for capex is simply not congruent with some of the dark expectations and the share price pullback. A major investment in data centers is indicative of a steeply rising level of cloud based business transactions regardless of exactly the level of revenues recognized. And cloud based transactions are very likely to lead to accelerated levels of business consulting.Even at $250 million of free cash flow, the free cash flow yield works out to be just shy of 8%. This is another metric that either is in or close to bargain territory and one that supports the share price at the very least.I think the odds favor a successful turnaround. The company has been and remains a significant competitor in a large space that continues to grow rapidly. It has a significant installed base who have been loyal to the company even when the company did not provide them with the kinds of options that were of importance to many users at this time. The company continues to offer users technology that is competitive and is assessed by consultants as superior to that offered by competitors. The company's current CEO has experience in turnarounds and seems to understand the requirements of the task he faces. The company has set realistic expectations that don't imply headline progress in the next quarter or two.The company has yet to figure out an effective communications strategy with either analysts or investors. As a result, its shares are disdained with a lone purchase recommendation out of 22 analysts. That is a great set-up for investors, although one that can be frustrating at times. It has a valuation that would readily support a consolidation transaction with either strategic or private equity buyers.I think the odds for the company to achieve positive alpha over the coming year are quite strong and I think the shares have the potential for significant share price appreciation."
4017344,98236,2016-10-31T18:52:00-04:00,"Teradata reported the results of its September ending quarter on October 27th.The results were a significant beat on EPS, but a miss on revenues. And the Q4 guide was below prior consensus expectations.The miss was entirely a product of the company's belated move to offer time and quantity based acquisition models (subscription and cloud).The company is in the midst of a transition undertaken, mainly successfully, by many other companies in this space.The company's principal valuation metrics are among the most attractive seen in the enterprise IT space in some time, leaving the shares poised for positive alpha.","Teradata - Still looking for happy daysTeradata (NYSE:TDC) reported the results of its September ending quarter last Thursday. The immediate impact of the earnings release and company guidance caused the shares to lose 12% of their value. And that wasn't because the shares had been extended before - the shares had essentially traded in a range since the last release of earnings in early August. Has something changed dramatically over the past three months? Well, the IGV tracking index certainly hasn't - it is up 3% over that time period.Why might I title this article ""A Tale of Two companies?"" Mainly because I try to compare different business in the enterprise IT world with each other. PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) reported its results last week. It had pre-announced some of its headlines earlier in October, so the results weren't much of a surprise. PTC is not a competitor with TDC - they do not touch. But I consider PTC's shares to be somewhat of an analog with TDC's shares - although right now the market says that the correlation doesn't hold.PTC is another company in transition and frankly its legacy business in the PLM/CAD space is far less attractive than the growth metrics expected for TDC's efforts in business analytics and Big Data. PTC is trying to stabilize its legacy business but it is not really clear, other than a mega transaction, that it has done so. It has a strategy to become a significant competitor in the IoT space, but that is really a nascent effort.So why did PTC shares rise? The results showed continued deterioration on the reported top line and a concomitant decline in EPS. The bookings number is partially contrived in that the company has changed maintenance renewals into so-called cloud subscriptions. And for that, it has been well rewarded. The shares gained 7.5% in the wake of the earnings release and they were flat for the week as a whole. The shares are certainly well regarded by analysts with an average rating of between buy and strong buy. And for a company with a growth rate forecast to be 5-10% (bookings growth, adjusted for the large SLM transaction), and with earnings built on accruing a tax rate of 10-12%, the P/E for 2017 earnings as guided of more than 30X and the forecast free cash flow yield of 3.1% seem more than a little rich.What's the point here? Not so much that PTC is a bad company or even a bad investment although it may be the latter, but that it perhaps contrasts with what's going on at TDC in terms of share valuation. Rocky transitions aside, investors simply get a lot more for their dollar with TDC shares, be it growth potential, valuation or even customer retention capability. Dickens, of course, was comparing London and Paris in the days of the French Revolution when he wrote his famous novel. In the long run, as a proper Englishman of his station and time, he basically was fonder of London, and who could blame him if one lived in that era or this era come to that. But Paris has its moments - well that is a different story really - and so too will TDC, I believe. For longer-term investors with a bit of patience and a bit of foresight, I think this is a great entry point which will lead to significant positive alpha.Is the weather really that cold outside for Teradata?That comes from a great song ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" composed by Frank Loesser, a famous composer of his era and was first performed in 1944 as part of a house party. Different house parties then, quite different than what I am used to. I'm sure glad no one asks me to perform as part of the entrance fee for a house party. The song was eventually sold to MGM and Loesser won an Academy Award for it in 1949. It is still a popular song and was No. 13 in Adult Contemporary at the end of 2014.Teradata's results were not indicative of some atmospheric anomaly on the cold side. The results for the quarter were better than expected in terms of earnings. Revenues declined 3%, which was expected, given the sale of the Marketing Applications business during the quarter. I believe that the sale of the marketing automation business was the precipitating factor in the so-called ""revenue"" miss. Gross margins increased by 100 bps. Overall, non-GAAP EPS of $.69 exceeded prior consensus expectations by $.10. That is the third earnings beat in a row.TDC is one of the lowliest rated companies around with an average rating of between hold and underperform according to First Call. One might think that low-rated companies are those that are either highly valued - certainly not the case with this company or those that are expected to lose ground to competitors or are in difficult spaces. The valuation for TDC is one of the closest there is in my space to a real value name. With an enterprise value of a bit less than $3 billion, it has an EV/S of 1.3X. The P/E, based on the average consensus expectations for the next 12 months, is 11X.Through the first nine months of the year, CFFO rose to $395 million from $370 million. That's primarily a function of the improvement in reported GAAP income which was offset by a decrease in the recognition of impairment charges. Stock-based comp is a little more than 10% of reported cash flow through nine months. Changes in deferred revenues are mainly a factor of seasonality as the annual billings for maintenance services are recognized as revenue. That is likely to change as the new business model evolves. The company reported a negative capex provision so free cash flow is actually greater than reported CFFO. Overall, the way the company defines free cash flow, it rose a bit to $309 million in the first nine months of the year compared to $276 million in the prior year period.The CFO has forecast negative free cash flow in Q4 for a variety of reasons that I will discuss during this article. Most significant will be research and development expense, much of which can be capitalized but still reduces free cash flow. Overall, free cash flow for the year was forecast by the CFO to be $290 million.Because of the company's business transformation strategy, it is hard to forecast free cash flow for 2017. It depends mostly on the interplay between reported net income and the change in deferred revenue. My guess at this point is that free cash flow will be in the range of $250-300 million which would provide a free cash flow yield in the mid-teens range, reflecting investor uncertainty regarding the company's future. It is almost unprecedented to see free cash flow yields of 15% in the enterprise IT space.TDC's major competitors are considered to be IBM (NYSE:IBM), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) that have many other products and different sets of financial parameters and are not comparable. But that being said, free cash flow yield for Oracle is 8.6% and free cash flow yield for IBM is 6.7% which perhaps is an indication of the vast valuation differential between TDC and its competitors.Neither IBM nor Oracle exactly enjoyed an easy transition to the cloud. Many uncertainties remain for both companies and yet TDC is valued at no more than half and probably less the valuation for its competitors. Obviously, observers and investors think the company has become and will remain irrelevant to the data analytics space and that its solutions will over time be replaced by more modern technologies.So here it is that TDC is considered to be a leader in its space, the space in which it leads is considered to have attractive growth potential and yet its valuation is one of the major outliers in the enterprise IT space. I think that the valuation anomaly is likely to prove unreasonable and that concerns regarding the ""rockiness"" of the transition are dramatically overdone and overdrawn. One of those cases in which the ""results of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.""The company does face lots of challenges. The challenges are well understood by management. It has a loyal customer base as has been reported by analysts who have downgraded the shares (See my commentary as of October. Presumably, the survey I referenced then by the downgrading analyst regarding resoundingly positive customer checks is still operative). The analyst at that point talked about his concerns regarding a rocky transition. Do the results and the guidance present evidence that the transition is rocky? Much of this article will take a look at that question. Needless to say, I reach a different conclusion. Whether or not readers will… I suppose will be the quality of the analysis I present and how they view risks and rewards.And that brings us to the answer to the question - what happened to the shares reflected management guidance and commentary regarding the company's business transformation. Management reduced its headline expectations for Q4 and by implication suggested that the results of 2017 would also be less than the prior consensus.Q4 revenues are now expected to be in the range of $620-640 million and EPS is expected to be in the range of $.57-.62. On the face of it, it would be a bit surprising to see sequential revenues increase by $80 million (15%) with EPS falling sequentially. Might it be that guidance, in the wake of many years of disappointing results, is deliberately conservative? It would be a new standard to be sure for TDC to under-promise and over-deliver, but that is actually the record of the past three quarters.The answer to the conundrum is that the company is anticipating a major swing of its customers to its subscription model. In Q3, CFO Steve Scheppmann said that overall revenues would have risen marginally rather than decline by 3% absent the switch of users to subscription offerings. Product revenues declined 10%, again not because the company sold a lesser quantity of Teradata solutions, but because more of what it did sell was based on ratable transactions which shift revenues substantially from one quarter to future time periods. In fact, despite the shift of revenues, product gross margins rose substantially during the quarter, suggesting that demand was decent and pricing discipline was strong.Rockiness - Real or in the eyes of ""myopians""I suppose there isn't an individual alive that isn't a myopian to a greater or lesser extent. How many readers knew in 2010 that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS would become a $13 billion/year business with operating margins of 32%. Not this writer for sure. When investors come to consider Teradata, it is easy to be myopic and look at the tall trees and thick underbrush and lose sight of the forest.The fact is that the company didn't jump into the cloud with both feet at the start of the cloud revolution. The fact is that the company more or less ignored different pricing options for acquiring technology. Go back long enough and the company struggled to avoid what are best known today as data appliances because of the impact they might have had on the company's installed base. That is the past. These are serious indictments of the history of TDC, but they seem to be understood and accepted by the current management.The question is really not about the past but about the future. I think the first issue to look at is what does the change from perpetual to time-based or usage-based pricing mean to gross margins. Apparently, not very much during the transition. And with that said, over time, given the user loyalty and the longevity of data warehouse solutions, gross margins will ultimately rise. Users are willing to pay more to acquire the same functionality if it improves their flexibility. The hybrid cloud, Teradata's focus these days offers other financial benefits beyond those of just the price charged by a vendor to a user. If the initial stage of the transition is going to produce consistent gross margins as the CFO indicated would be discussed in detail during next month's analyst day, that is very positive news and might suggest something more than is realized about the business environment for the company and user satisfaction and loyalty.Another issue to be considered is cannibalization. As mentioned with regards to PTC, much of the bookings growth that is reported by that company reports is simply cannibalization. What used to be called maintenance renewals are now described as a cloud/subscription bookings and it doesn't indicate that more PTC product is being purchased. Nice work if you can get it - and I wonder how long it can be obtained.In the TDC transition, the CFO, Steve Scheppmann, said during the call in response to a specific question:That is really the key element for most companies in their transitions. When I write about Oracle or IBM and take issue with what I see as cannibalization, it is because I simply do not see their workloads expanding as they move to the cloud and I actually see their market share decreasing. If readers believe the CFO, then the opportunity here, especially given the valuation, is more considerable than most investors or readers perhaps realize.How are investors going to realize if TDC's transition is working?Many companies have had to deal with this issue. Usually investors get it after a time, and then sometimes they get it too well. Perhaps the best transition of all from the standpoint of shareholders was that executed by Aspen Tech (NASDAQ:AZPN). Aspen never really needed to change the technology to any significant extent - it simply told everyone it was going to a subscription model enhanced by ""tokens"" that allowed it to charge its customers based on additional modules and combined usage and it didn't worry too much about headline numbers. Yes, the transition took seven years - really - but none of the shareholders over the period suffered much - except to gnash their teeth as I did when the shares exceeded my price target and just kept on climbing. The company reported several metrics that were related to bookings that at the time were novelties for investors and it had an exceptionally charismatic CEO in Mark Fusco who had been one of the members of the Olympic ice hockey team in the 1984 Winter Olympics.Most modern cloud companies report derived bookings and also report long-term deferred revenues that allow analysts to get a good picture as to what is really happening in terms of user purchases of software. And it sounded to me, from the conference call, that TDC is likely to proceed down exactly that track and will be revealing the metrics necessary for investors to understand demand for the company's products. Here is the CFO on the topic:I think one of the keys to share price performance is a transition to an emphasis on derived bookings as the metric of most importance. Once that happens, I think the rest of the story can fall into place.A couple of things to mention here. There were signs that the shift to subscription revenues had a positive impact on deferred revenue growth last quarter. Not enough to overcome the impact of the normal seasonal influence of recognizing maintenance revenue from annual contracts and not enough to overcome the exclusion of time and material charges from the calculation. Just too much of a weight to overcome. But it appears as though there was some increase in product deferred revenues.But most importantly, at least in terms of looking at the potential for share price evolution, most every company that reports derived booking and utilizes calculations of unbilled revenues shortly achieves much higher valuation metrics than had been the case before. The reason why the cloud companies enjoy the valuation they do is far more rational than some readers might perceive - they are valued on bookings and not reported revenues and on bookings they are both more profitable and larger than the bare numbers would portray. I have no reason to believe that the impact of discussing booking and unbilled revenues will be any different when it comes to TDC's valuation than it has been for all of the other companies that have taken that route. How will investors determine the success of the company's transition to the cloud and to a competitive subscription revenue model? Basically by watching trends in bookings and trends in deferred product deferred revenues - and that should be a good thing for the current beaten-up valuation.What about the other parts of the equation?The other part of the equation is costs, and it is fair to forecast that next year is going to see declining reported revenues and rising reported costs. Again, from the conference call and from the CFO (The CEO, Vic Lund, was pre-recorded on the call and was not available live as he was in the San Diego development center. Maybe he didn't want to get up early to answer questions - it would have been 5:30 a.m. He probably was carousing the night before):Teradata has reduced opex for five straight quarters now in an attempt to staunch its bleeding. But, as the saying goes, you really can't ""save your way to prosperity."" At some point, if the company wants to sell more, it is going to need new solutions that are congruent with what its base wants to buy and sales people who have the experience to sell those kinds of cloud-specific solutions.Investors looking to acquire or to hold positions in TDC shares more or less are making the bet that the company is prudently investing its resources to rekindle its growth engine. There is really no dispositive answer other than the green shoots that were reported last quarter. I think there is a high probability that the company's customers will shift their buying patterns to time and usage based models. In Q3, the transition was more toward on-premise subscriptions and the TDC managed cloud. Those are the baby steps. The switch to AWS and to the company's ""database as a service"" is even more nascent at this point. Plenty of evidence would support the expected change in the consumption models, and over time, that change is likely to be more focused on both as a service and Amazon offerings.And the company is undertaking what it needs to do to ensure that the transition adds to the amount of Teradata solutions being consumed. But how much and at what rate is not known yet - what will be known are the costs entailed with putting the company's infrastructure in place to support its financial goals.Based on the comments from the CFO regarding next year spend and absent any commentary about how revenues will play out in the transition, many analysts have reduced their EPS expectations. The consensus in the wake of the earnings conference call is that EPS will fall 10% next year to $2.21 on a 4% decline in revenues. That 4% decline in revenues is bigger than it might seem in that TDC only gets 37% of its revenues from product license. So, a 4% decline in total revenues is equivalent to a 10% decline in product revenues.Will that really happen? I am obviously not sure, but it might. It depends on how fast the conversion to subscription goes. We don't know exactly what the relationship is between each percentage point switch from on-prem revenues to subscription bookings, and so there is no realistic method for precisely determining what reported revenues might be. At this point, I would have to imagine that opex will increase, but by what percentage is not really known writing in advance of the analyst day and company determination of how it will balance investments with other cost actions.Logically, it ought not to matter all that much. No one owning or thinking about acquiring TDC shares ought to care about the short-term specifics of the transition. If they do worry about that, they are probably in the wrong name. The shares already reflect some kind of expectation for a profit Armageddon and do not reflect any potential for a successful transition. Compared to other companies such as PTC that are making the same journey, or even Oracle or IBM for that matter, the shares are on sale - a fire-sale more or less. And the company's shares are despised by the analyst community given the dispersion of recommendations.The shares, as they are currently valued, seem to rule out the potential for the acquisition of this company. The company still has a large and apparently loyal installed base and selling at a multiple of maintenance revenues rarely seen for a profitable company. As many readers have pointed out, Gartner is not necessarily the font for all wisdom and truth. But even a brief look at what it has to say in its current report on the space would leave readers with the idea that the company has very satisfied customers and a great deal of technology that is now being packaged in such a way that it best appeals to users. The current valuation is compelling to me. If readers are concerned about what might be said during analyst day, they can scale into the name between now and that time which is scheduled for November 17. I think there are lots of positive alpha and much of the risk has been mitigated by the extremely low valuation accorded the company's shares."
3872956,98236,2016-02-07T14:50:14-05:00,"Teradata has been in operational decline for at least three years now.Company management has been both greedy and short-sighted in addressing material changes in the business environment.The company's Q4 had a few signs of stability in terms of revenue generation although product gross margins were pressured.The company has a transformation program that will address some of the marketplace issues that have halted growth.The company, because of its compressed valuation and the high growth space in which it operates, is seemingly an ideal candidate for acquisition.","Introduction:February 4th, 2016, proved to be a seminal day in the history of Big Data Analytics. On the one hand, industry leader Tableau (NYSE:DATA) hit one of the more dramatic speed bumps of all time with a significant license revenue miss and very soft guidance, particularly in the current quarter.And then there were the results of industry laggard Teradata (NYSE:TDC). Just to be clear, TDC does not compete with Tableau in any meaningful sense. Yes, they both sell software solutions that are used in the broadly defined analytics space. Tableau essentially sells software that allows users to create charts and graphs and other visualized reports from all kinds of data. TDC mainly sells data warehouse solutions to large enterprises. They really don't compete against each other for specific deals.And also to be clear, TDC did not have some kind of breakout quarter. Revenues still dropped 1% in constant currency although that was significantly better than prior expectations. There were some signs of life in the Americas region that grew by 3% in Q4 and among the largest TDC customers where revenues actually grew, reversing a decline in the mid-single digits that had been seen during the first nine months of the year. The results for the company's Big Data Appliance - primarily the results of what used to be called Aster Data - were up 50% on the year and Big Data consulting grew faster than that. There were some green shoots apparent in the company's very nascent cloud offering where revenues doubled off a very small base. On the other hand, gross margins declined by almost 500 basis points, partially reflecting the transition to cloud as well as the mix of what the company sold. Indeed, product gross margins which took the brunt of the transition-related pressures, declined by more than 800 basis points. And, of course, the company's legacy products business, its flagship Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) solutions fell by about 10% in the period. It was hardly a pretty picture although less dire than the results of prior quarters.The shares did respond to these less than disastrous operating results with an 11% rise to a peak on February 4th. Since that time, in the wake of the Tableau miss, they have essentially retraced 80% of that inter-day move which has left the shares scarcely above where they had been before Q4 earnings were announced.But there is a case to be made for investing in the name, I believe, and I think that the shares, battered as they have been, are now at a reasonable entry point. For better or worse, the weak stock market overall and the reaction to the unpleasantness at Tableau have limited the upside reaction to the company's Q4 earnings and guidance. While up by hardly more than 1% from the share price reached just before earnings, the shares are still down by about 10% since the start of the year. I will discuss valuation in a bit of detail below, but the fact is that TDC is the closest thing to a value name in the data analytics space. And while it has an arduous transition through which it must go that is undetermined in terms of length, it also has some attributes that may be unexpected.Background:Some readers may be unfamiliar with TDC although it is not an insubstantial player in the analytics space with revenues above $2 billion. The company was first to market with a data warehousing product and that continues to be and is likely to remain a mainstay of the company's solution set for the foreseeable future.TDC was founded as a venture between Citibank's Advanced Technology Group and Cal Tech at the end of the 1970s. Not surprisingly, the company concentrated on solutions that were particularly applicable to the banking industry and, as a result, it was eventually purchased by NCR. The banking industry and financial services in general have remained a key vertical for the company till this day. Again, there is nothing on the horizon that suggests that banks are not going to continue to need data warehouses - data warehouses are pervasive in financial service, pharma, retail, healthcare, etc.The company was spun-out from NCR back in 2007 at which time it was doing about $1.7 billion of revenues and earning $1.24 per share non-GAAP. Back then, the company's CEO was Mike Koehler, a position he had been in since 2003 and a position he still holds today.Fast forward to today, and the company has achieved just a bit more than $600 million of revenue growth including one significant acquisition for a compound growth rate of less than 5% since it became independent. It is hard to believe that a company started with a leadership role in a high growth space and could get so much wrong over its time as an independent company. Management really does matter.The company is forecasting another marginal decrease in revenues this year, net of the impact of divesting its marketing applications business. Company earnings guidance is for about $2.35 per share, up from $2.06 for 2015. Much of that increase is the product of divesting the marketing applications group although some of it is what the company describes as its transformational initiatives.I think it is worth discussing what went wrong at TDC as a prelude to see if the ship can be righted. Basically, what went wrong here was that company management was both greedy and short sighted and missed coping with several significant industry trends. When TDC emerged from NCR, its business model was quite simple and relatively easy to operate. It would sell users a package of hardware and software in which the users could store their data and use tools and templates to extract it and to put it into very simplified reports. TDC basically took off the shelf storage hardware, primarily from NetApp, marked it up significantly, loaded its proprietary software and sold it to the customers. It then sold loads of consulting services that users more or less had to buy in order to implement the hardware/software bundle they had bought.Sales were pretty easy back then, primarily because few companies were major competitors. User data requirements expanded at a rapid pace and every few years TDC would introduce a new series of enterprise data warehouses that had significant improvements in price/performance. At that time, the users were encouraged to do what were called ""floor sweeps"" and replace their old equipment with the newest offering from TDC. The strategy had worked for many years and company management saw little reason to tinker with the model.The Great Recession hit the company quite hard. The company's financial services and retail verticals were greatly impacted and the impacts of the recession lingered into 2010. The company started to enjoy a strong recovery, and by 2012, sales reached just short of $2.7 billion and EPS was $2.44 for the year. At that point, the shares hit an all-time high of $80 and it has been a long slow grind lower to current levels.Although management did buy Aster Data in 2011 in an effort to capture the emerging market for the analysis of extra-large data sets, it basically ignored the market for what are called converged systems or data appliances which were far cheaper and could deal with queries far more quickly than standard EDWs. Management would barely allow the sales force to sell TDC's appliances and refused to scale the company's own offerings in appliances for fear of disrupting its own base. The problem for TDC is that its competitors which included Netezza and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Exadata were under no such constraints, and they started to enjoy some competitive takeaways and forced TDC to respond to aggressive pricing. While data appliances were a problem for TDC, the cloud has proven to be a disaster as many users have begun to locate their data warehouses in third party cloud repositories. Users have been less and less willing to pay TDC some huge mark-up to buy what by now are commodity storage boxes whose prices themselves have been pressured by the advent of solid state drives. Management had a chance to be a leader in converged systems, it had a chance to be a real leader in Big Data and it might have lead the revolution into the cloud. It did none of those things and kept reassuring investors that nothing had fundamentally changed and that the business was on the cusp of renewing its erstwhile growth pattern.There are, to be sure, similar stories of frustration in the enterprise software space. Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) comes to mind along with I-Two and Manugistics that proved too adept at snatching defeat from the jaws of opportunity. But TDC is certainly in the running for having been one of the more frustrating names to own or to follow over the past three years.The Investment CaseMuch of the investment case is predicated as much on valuation grounds as on growth. As I have written in former articles, my predilections are to recommend fast growing names which for one reason or another are under-appreciated by investors. That is not the case here. Management guidance, to the extent that it can be trusted, yields a P/E on 2016 non-GAAP earnings of a bit less than 10X. The company has a current EV/S that is probably not much greater than 1.1X depending on the actual price it gets for its marketing applications division. The division generated just shy of $200 million of revenues last year which was more or less flat in constant currency and should be able to fetch $500 million from a raft of interested buyers. The company generated just greater than $400 million of operating cash last year and free cash flow was about $280 million, roughly comparable to non-GAAP net income. At the end of 2015, the company had a small net positive cash balance. Once it completes the sale of its marketing applications unit, it will have a positive cash balance that should handily exceed $500 million. Looking at 2016, it should be able to generate somewhat closer to $500 million of cash and free cash flow out to rise to about $350 million which provides a free cash flow yield of close to 13% on the company's enterprise value to be after its planned disposition.Are those levels of valuation enough to support a buy recommendation? I think I would be on the cusp in trying to make a recommendation. Teradata, as an independent vendor, is going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and lots of money trying to migrate as much of its base to the cloud as it can, and during that period, EPS growth and reported revenue growth are likely to turn out to be very modest.But at these valuations, the company is surely an attractive candidate to be consolidated. It has an unrivalled installed base in the data warehousing segment and its overall solution set in the EDW space remains unmatched. It has been run by a management team that has to be labeled inept. Many potential buyers are going to see ways in which they can either dramatically improve margins or the growth rate or achieve other revenue synergies or perhaps all of these at the same time. The Aster property in different hands would almost surely create significant sales synergies that for one reason or the other have been unrealized by this management. And it is certainly plausible to think that an activist investor could demand a change in management and a plan to maximize the company's returns, even if it remains independent.ConclusionTeradata is a rare valuation play in the enterprise software space, run for many years by an inbred, stodgy management who has basically been in denial about rapid changes in the industry. That being said, the company retains its leadership position as the single largest supplier of EDW systems to the market. It has a strong and rapidly growing big data solution. Despite all of its trials and tribulations, it is comfortably profitable and generates significant operating and free cash flow. And it exists as an underperforming, independent vendor in a space that has been consolidated to a significant extent and will continue to be consolidated in the future. TDC is not the ""prettiest"" of companies at which to look but it does, I believe, offer investors favorable risk/rewards and the potential for a home run if the company is consolidated is hardly minimal."

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to compose an article regarding Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) performance. Based on a significant number of commentaries I received, I wasn't able to touch on all of the hot buttons of readers and to tell them how many wonderful things Amazon had done and would be doing.And now today, I find myself composing an article that looks at one of the doggier companies that has existed in the enterprise IT space - and part of its dogginess has been its inability to choose to work with Amazon until right now in terms of integrating that company's platform with the Teradata (NYSE:TDC) applications.I wrote an article several months ago regarding the possible light at the end of the TDC tunnel. Some of the things that I wanted to see have now happened. Today, I heard the new CEO and a couple of his staff talk about the transformation this company is seeking to effect. Will they restart the engine in the current environment? Yes, I think they have better than a 50% chance of bringing it off, but it will not be immediate and there will be some pitfalls and speed bumps to negotiate. But investors looking at a decent value name in the Big Data/Analytics space could do worse than look at this one - although to be sure there isn't much else to find in the Big Data/Analytics space that has revenues and profitsThe shares have appreciated somewhat this morning in the wake of the earnings announcement. But there was no guidance raise here - in fact, since Q2 was a beat and the full-year guidance is flat, there are some who might say that guidance was trimmed for the second half of the year. Overall, the shares are up about 20% since the post Brexit lows compared to a change in the IGV of 9% over that same period. Since I wrote my first piece regarding TDC opportunities back in early February, the shares have appreciated 27% compared to the 30% appreciation of the IGV. So, thus far, since early February, there has been no positive alpha.While earnings estimates have crept up by 2-3% over the past quarter, no one is forecasting any revenue growth from their 2016 estimates. The shares are rated just below hold in the First Call consensus with price targets on average being 10% less than the current price of the shares. That, in and of itself, is an excellent set-up for a company in the midst of a possible turnaround.At this point, TDC has more than $7.20/share in cash although 98% of the cash is offshore. It also has long-term debt of $552 million. The current enterprise value is $3.44 billion which produces an EV/S for the current year of 1.49X. Based on the company's current projection, the free cash flow yield for TDC will be 8% or so. The company indicated that there is potential upside to the free cash flow estimate based on the year-ending profile of assets and liabilities, particularly A/R. The company has a P/E of 12X current year non-GAAP earnings. Stock-based comp is quite low at around 10% of reported non-GAAP earnings. The other adjusting items have to do with one-time charges related to the disposition of the company's marketing assets business as well as reorganization costs. With those kind of valuation metrics, there is plenty of upside if the company's efforts to re-invent itself are even marginally successful. With that level of valuation, the company presents a very attractive acquisition target to both strategic and private equity investors. In the wake of the company's guidance for the next two quarters, I think downside exposure is very limited as well.The company may not get sold - the CEO said he wanted to see the turnaround through - but there will almost certainly be offers. At the least, the company has a customer base that includes 40% of the Fortune 500 and that kind of customer base could make TDC attractive to a host of strategic buyers, while with an 8% free cash flow yield, the temptation for P/E buyers is likely to prove overwhelming.It is hard to believe now, but at one time exiting the Great Recession and for a couple of years after that, TDC was thought to be a growth superstar and was given the best that institutions could offer in terms of valuation and free passes. The company bought one of hottest unicorns of the day in Aster Data, and there were rumors that Dayton, Ohio, its corporate home would become the ""silicon farm.""And then reality set in. At first it was just brokerage seminars regarding the many Big Data appliances and Big Data open source software that were coming to the market. But over time, the entire business model imploded and the senior management found itself in denial and unable to take the dramatic steps that were necessary to develop a strategy that was designed to address the competitive realities of both the cloud and the multitude of Big Data solutions that had seemingly developed while Dayton had slept.To be totally fair, it would have taken someone with the strength of a Hercules, the intelligence of a Socrates and the articulateness of a Pericles to pull off this transformation without lots of blood and angst. It isn't terribly surprising that the men who had lead the company successfully through its quiet past were simply not up to the task of making a series of difficult decisions that would have gone against everything that had made TDC successful in its past.As Abraham Lincoln had once said, ""The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate for the stormy present… We must think anew and act anew and then we will save…"" And no, President Lincoln was really not thinking about Teradata when he wrote to the Congress in December of 1862.Here is how the engine gets restarted!There are three parts to any business transformation. The first of these, often unrecognized is replacing the old management. For Teradata, that started just a bit more than 2 months ago with the appointment of Vic Lund as CEO. Mr. Lund had been an outside TDC director and chairman of the audit committee and he has had other experience in the tech world. Regardless of anything else, it is far easier for a new broom to sweep away all the detritus than would ever have been possible in any other fashion. Just yesterday, the company announced that it had dismissed its erstwhile COO. The head of European Consulting has been brought back to the US to run that function globally. Extractions are always painful, but they are most often necessary and the course of extractions is likely to continue.Mr. Lund talked about a few things that probably resonated significantly with many investors. The first of these had to do with the fact that TDC is finally prepared to offer its technology on both Amazon AWS and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. It sounds more or less incredible that this hasn't happened until now, but to say that the old management was resistant to change is really an extreme understatement.Mr. Lund talked about embracing open systems technology - specifically Hadoop - but there are other Big Data alternatives and Mr. Lund sees collaboration with all of them based on customer demand. This has been an incredible sticking point with customers - as well as most outside observers so far as that goes - who have wanted to use a combination of TDC and open source which has been resisted by the prior management.Mr. Lund talked about providing the sales force with the tools, infrastructure and direction that it needs in order to be successful. For many years now, until very recently, checks I have made had always come back that the TDC sales force has been ill-staffed, ill-supported and ill-directed and far too highly paid for what it had been able to accomplish.There is more than a little that Mr. Lund said that needed saying. The company has been mis-run and almost run into the ground by past management. Has the company waited until too late? There will be some who will say that it has, and no one can gainsay them with any specific evidence at this point. One might question the speed with which all of the changes and the strategies Mr. Lund spoke to can be successfully implemented. I think it would be harder, however, to doubt the man's commitment and his fervor with the task he has undertaken.Usually, the first marker in trying to determine the odds of success for an organization is for observers to ensure that the management at least knows where it wants to go and how it might get there. Mr. Lund and his team seem very well aware of where they want to go and how they might get there. Mr. Lund knows very well where he wants to go. As the song in South Pacific goes, ""if you don't have a dream, how you gonna have a dream come true."" He certainly has his dream!The second major component of most transformation I have seen usually consists of cost rectification. There are two parts to right sizing an enterprise. One of those consists of simply reducing headcount and disposing of surplus facilities. That is the easier than the other part which consists of ensuring the company has the appropriate resources to address business opportunities. The company has wiped out lots of costs - part of the significant overattainment in EPS was that costs have come down more dramatically than forecast.Overall, selling general and administrative costs fell by about 10% year on year while research and development costs contracted by about 13%. Based on commentary this morning, it seems as though the company may have overshot its cost containment strategy and it will be adding back some development resources and some sales infrastructure resources going forward. While the magnitude of those increases isn't entirely clear, the company's forward guidance, which was unchanged in terms of both revenue and EPS despite the Q2 overattainment, suggest that the need to rebuild is not insubstantial.The other of the issue is going to try to find a way forward for the company. That is to say, can Teradata find a niche for itself in the modern, cloud-centric world competing against technologies that were born, when its ""enterprise data warehouse ""concept had reached maturity? Needless to say, there isn't some simple definitive answer to that question, and the odds are that most observers are only going to recognize that the transformation has taken hold in arrears. Lacking my serving of prescience means that I really don't anticipate that I will have the foresight to proclaim, ""this is the transformation"" before it happens. But short of seeing the empyrean, there are elements of the transformation that ought to be visible in a quantifiable fashion to show real progress.What are the chances of pulling it off?I recently read a column by Michael Barone who writes for the Washington Examiner and is a commentator for Fox News. Mr. Barone had recently interviewed 12 senior officials from both major parties regarding the coming electoral contest. 10 of 12 Republicans and 11 of 12 Democrats said that their candidate was going to win. What does this have to do with Teradata? Basically the column says it isn't clear what is a winning strategy. In this case, the question isn't quite what is a winning strategy, but whether management can pull it off? No one really can forecast those things before they actually happen.I liked what I heard from Vic Lund. He recognized that TDC had been trying to force users to buy what they didn't want to buy and to buy it on terms that were no longer suitable to the way they wanted to do business. He recognized that the public cloud was a major factor in the IT world and that TDC has to have a set of hybrid cloud offerings to appeal to its large user base or they will no longer continue to buy from TDC. He understands the issues that have arisen regarding open source and Big Data. And to me, last but hardly least, he recognizes the issues of a disaffected sales force with mediocre leadership that has more or less been left without an effective product strategy road map to articulate. But as he was first to acknowledge on the call, articulating what needs to be done and then getting it done are two very different things.From my perspective, the issue is really going to be one of sales execution more than any other single factor. Many of the required solutions that TDC can sell are either on the cusp of launch or will be in full GA within the next 12 months. Putting the right technology in the market is not an insurmountable hurdle.The other horses in the race are not foes of insurmountable prowess. But as Mr. Lund suggested on the call, TDC has a long road in terms of getting its users to think of the company as a vendor that has what customers want to buy, packaged in ways that are far easier for users to acquire these days, and at price points that are competitive. TDC has a reputation of being stodgy, inflexible and not easy to do business with, and that perception has to be fixed, and is far more than a matter of a global tour on the part of the new CEO. A lot of what has been lacking at the company is simply a reasonable way of presenting current and new users with TDC solutions packaged and presented in a way that makes it easy for users to do business with the company. Just how easy it will be to turn around perceptions and re-engage the sales force and the customer base is not something that is easy to handicap. Whatever else is true, it is going to take a few quarters and the path to success is not going to be a straight line.Transitions and Transitions!Mr. Lund was reasonably forthright about some of the impact regarding one of the transitions that TDC is going to go through the next several years should it remain independent. The fact is that subscription revenues and cloud services are going to significantly displace product revenues in the mix over the coming quarters and that is not going to help headline numbers. During the course of the call, Mr. Lund cited two 8-figure transactions that had been booked, but which were being recognized ratably. To what extent overall revenues may have been impacted by a mix switch to ratable transactions was not made clear. Just how much this change is going to impact future revenues was not quantified - and I am not too sure that if it had been I would have put too much stock in such a forecast. It was acknowledged that one of the reasons that revenue guidance and earnings guidance remained unchanged despite the Q2 overattainment had to do with the likely impact of the mix shift in the next two quarters.The guidance for the balance of the year and the consensus forecast for next year suggest no top line growth. How that reconciles with some bookings metric that reflects a mix shift to a ratable model is not known.About all we know is that the guidance provided does reflect the impact of the transition. How much that transition might impact 2017 results is not really forecast although both Mr. Lund and CFO Steven Scheppmann said that both operating expense and research and development would increase in the next two quarters and in 2017 as well. So, this may be a case in which business metrics are improving but headline numbers are not showing comparable improvement. Faced with similar issues, many companies would introduce bookings disclosures, and might even go so far as to present a reconciliation between reported numbers and the reported business value of bookings in terms of adjusting the P&L. I have no idea if this company will decide to attempt to better display its progress in that fashion, but it might be significant in terms of the outook for the shares.Also not quite clear to me is how the company's sales of products within both AWS and Azure are going to be most likely recorded. Management suggested that there are some transactions of scale that are likely to take place early on as the AWS offering in particular has been extensively tested and should be ready to go. To what extent these transactions will be recognized ratably as they are ""in the cloud"" was not discussed with any level of granularity.The latest market research that has been released with regards to the business potential of the Big Data/Analytics market in which TDC competes is that it will increase by 50% (the exact CAGR is just above 11% and that it will be centered on services.Given the strategy that the company articulated in this morning's conference call, it is not inconceivable that the company could grow in line with the market through 2017 although that growth would be weighted heavily in the two last years of the period. Management talked extensively about the need to enhance its consulting capabilities in order to provide an objective path for clients to achieve their goals in Big Data/Analytics. That indeed is what IDC study, cited above, suggests will be the sweet spot for user demand.But at this point, just about no one in the analyst community expects that TDC will be able to execute successfully and the fact that the shares have climbed above the consensus analyst target price is a graphic of that kind of expectation.The litany goes that TDC is a dinosaur, it has missed out on the industry transformation and it isn't even aware that it has done so. Its salesmen hate it, and the good ones are looking to change jobs and the less qualified are using their employment as a safe haven. Again, the negative case goes on to articulate that its customers are looking for alternative vendors.Frankly, that is all history, and accurate history at that, but it is not an objective effort to try to discern the probability of a new management with a very large and very clean broom being able to capture just some of the opportunity that consultants believe exists in the company's market space. The fact that the short interest is 15% of the float and that retail ownership of the name is essentially non-existent further demonstrate just poorly the company is perceived by investors.Transitions are one of the more difficult things to call mainly because they force analysts and investors to throw away trends and in some cases long existing trends. And in this case, belief in redemption is going to go against the shibboleths of ""technology correctness"" so to speak.How do you lay a bet when there are no real odds-makers?If there were real odds-makers with real data about the future, then odds would be far less. I think that all investors can do is to look at potential risks and rewards. The risk is that the company will continue to lose share in a rapidly growing market. That is what has happened now for a few years and so it might continue to happen. But to a greater or lesser extent, that is what the consensus is forecasting - the risk isn't that the company will lose share, but that the company will lose share at an accelerating pace. The fact is, that this quarter's results actually reversed that trend by a marginal amount, and probably more so if adjusted for the impact of a few large deals that went ratable.I've pointed out the valuation metrics earlier in this article and it is easy enough to see just how compressed is the valuation of TDC shares. I would say the risks are far less than meet the eye.And the rewards. Well, I think that many observers would concede that what this company has would be worth a significant premium to an acquisitor. No, the place this company finds itself is not particularly in style. TDC is not really a cloud vendor, and we have no idea as to the percentage of its revenues that are based on renewable streams. However, given the continued tsunami of consolidation in the IT space and the valuation and the customer base, betting on a consolidation transaction with a major premium is not really a long-odds bet. And if it doesn't happen - well it seems to this observer as though management, at least at a 30,000 Ft. level is finally steering the army to a reasonable objective.Summing Up!After months of strong growth on the part of the high tech index, it has become increasingly difficult to find companies of some scale and some profitability that have valuations that make them suitable candidates for value investors. Teradata has started what will be a long and arduous path to recovery, but its valuation pays investors for the wait. It should be on the cusp of achieving positive alpha."
4026704,98236,2016-11-28T14:19:00-05:00,"Teradata held its analyst meeting a bit less than two weeks ago.The company made some startling positive forecasts for its expectations through 2021.Self evidently, the analysts listening were not impressed or were more focused on headline 2017 results than anything else.Behind the forecast, the company announced far reaching changes in pricing, packaging and go-to-market models that would, if realized, significantly transform Teradata.While next year's headlines will be marked by negative revenue growth and sharply lower EPS, the company will start to report bookings in full detail and is expecting meaningful growth.","Teradata: Can the ayes ever prevail?There is a story about the American Constitutional convention of 1787. It has been said that Benjamin Franklin kept staring at a painting on a chair in which convention chairman George Washington sat in what is now Constitution Hall. Apparently, the painting showed a landscape with a picture of the sun at the horizon. Dr. Franklin said, it is reported, that he had looked at the painting all summer to determine if the sun were rising or setting. But with the work of the convention at an end, he had determined the sun to be rising over our liberties and future. I thought the metaphor appropriate for the theme at the Teradata (NYSE:TDC) analyst day. I think, were Dr. Franklin in attendance, and if he were called on to answer the self-same question, he would describe the outlook for TDC as one of the rising sun.The purpose of this article is to discuss what was presented at the analyst meeting and what might be expectations for the presentation and the financial forecasts to be realized. There is no doubt that what was presented was nothing short of audacious. But there is some basis for the expectations that were presented and it is interesting to lay out the case - both pro and con - with that which is animating the company's adoption of a high bar with a CAGR of 15% forecast between 2018-2021 and a terminal growth rate of 20%.Why is it relevant now? Teradata is going to report bookings at a detailed level at the start of 2017. If the bookings it reports start to show significant growth, investor and analyst expectations can change rapidly. Note carefully the performance of PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) shares this year. The company has reported declining headline numbers, strong bookings and the shares have exploded. Such a scenario is quite possible to envision at TDC and at the current low share prices the opportunity seems to be both timely and significant.Most of us have our portfolio favorites and then the names that we wish we had never met. I have been following Teradata as a company for years. The company was spun-off from NCR (NYSE:NCR) in the fall of 2007. It started trading at the end of September of 2007 at about $27/share and here it is more than nine years later at precisely the same share value. In that time, it has been to $80 and visited the nether regions of $12/share. Until recently, it was run by an entrenched management team that had been there when NCR spun the business off.The company recently held its analyst day in what was supposed to be something of a coming out party for its new management team. It wasn't apparent that the aspiring debutante spilled champagne on the other guests at the party. On the other hand, the other guests just couldn't find her charms. The shares, which have hardly been the greatest performers this year, or last year, or the last four years so far as that goes, responded to the meeting by falling another 6% or so. Somehow, I think that wasn't the intention of the hosts of the party.I have written my fair share about this company - more, perhaps than might be warranted by the level of interest among Seeking Alpha readers. But I like to try to keep readers informed on recommendations when it seems appropriate, and this is a long holiday weekend and I have no aspirations to go near a store or brave the crowds in New York City. Between the entertainments at Trump Tower and the rest of the tourists - well, I thought I would look at what Teradata had to say and why it seemed to be so poorly received.Analyst meetings in themselves don't change anything. Operating performance does. The company's last quarter was considered a miss and there are 30-plus days till the end of the year and the last quarter. I have no real way of handicapping how close of the quarter and the year will turn out. Again, regardless of rhetoric, the road back for this company will be long, hard and rocky. There is always the question of an appropriate entry point. As the saying goes, I have been ""long and wrong"" on this one. I will take a look at some of the takeaways I have from the analyst meeting and see if I can make sense in a few words about what was said and how likely it is that the company will achieve some of its goals. Turnarounds engender lots of skepticism and often turn out to take longer and achieve less than had been thought by their authors when they were started. I will try to examine the skeptical case as well as the positive case, although my instincts lean toward the latter.November 17 - Accession day or a walk through a field of busted dreams?Once upon a time, November 17 was a public holiday in the UK celebrating of the first Queen Elizabeth to the throne. You know, the Queen Elizabeth who is the subject of all those films and TV mini-series. It is a great story and one that lends itself well to modern dramatic sensibilities. The Teradata analyst day was also held on November 17 and it obviously lacked both star character and favorable reviews.Many investors - and some industry participants - perceive of TDC as an old, washed up, technology vendor who no longer has the ""right stuff"" with which to compete for Big Data wallet share. On the surface, and given the company's financial performance in recent years, that might seem to be a reasonable assumption. And there is certainly something about the company's history, particularly in the years around the turn of the decade, when Teradata avoided becoming a major vendor of data appliances and avoided become a cloud pioneer that might have supported that contention. But history is not analysis or forecasting, and the question to consider is whether or not the people and the subjects that were presented at the analyst day are reasonable and should be considered in forming an investment judgment about TDC shares.I confess that many analyst days present more chaff than wheat, along with bad food and never enough coffee and unripe fruit. But I think it is mandatory in a name like this to consider what was said, who said it and how they said it before forming a judgment based more on headline expectations that are considered to be far off from consensus expectations.Frankly, I've been both disappointed and encouraged by the number of analyst attendees. There were nine presenters and nine analysts present, which is a mis-match from ratios I used to see. And the event was held in San Diego, not in Dayton - it is a nice destination this time of the year - or really any time of the year. The fact is that there is plenty of runway for investors to become enthused with this name and, indeed, most analysts consider it some kind of unpleasant animal. FirstCall has its average rating as 3.2, one of the lowest such ratings in its universe. The average price target is just pennies above the current price. So, most people hate the name. The way to get paid for a successful turnaround is when you are well hated and TDC is well hated by the 20-plus analyst who ostensibly cover the company. It is a great contrarian story, if you like such things, and it has a valuation that will tend to magnify the reaction to positive news. And unlike some other cloud transition stories, the solutions already exist and are operating as customers. In terms of product, there is nothing on the come  - in terms of sales success... well that is so far a different matter.The shares have a very high short interest ratio at 17% of the float, and the short interest is reflective of belief that there is further downside in the name and is actually still rising. The company doesn't pay a dividend, although it has the cash flow to do so. It seems likely to me that it will either grow at the rate for which it is planning, or some kind of dividend is very likely. The valuation ratios are such that investors will be well compensated by decent financial performance.The Teradata story, at least for me, is that the company has a new CEO and in turn has a new management team. The new CEO has a plan, a certain swagger and lots of impatience in terms of creating a new model for TDC to follow. Mr. Lund has run a couple of conference calls now and he has said the right things and taken the right steps.He has a background that should be pleasing to investors. He has run a retail business and he has run a web business that was sold to IBM (NYSE:IBM). His age, 67, and his background suggest that he has been brought in to make a transformation more than to run an organization for a long time frame. I hate the phrase ""putting lipstick on a pig"" and, indeed, TDC is probably not a pig but the concept is there for all to see. But not all tech CEOs are young and brash - the CEO of CommVault (NASDAQ:CVLT) is now 70 and the CEO of Pega (NASDAQ:PEGA) is in his 60s and they are both going strong.There are many transformations that most investors/analysts expect to see from TDC. The first of these is for the company to transform itself from its historic focus on the sales of boxes, or hardware, to selling subscription-based consumption models that are based, for the most part, to be based on a hybrid cloud architecture. The company believes that this transformation will lead to double-digit growth for this company  - the skeptics see a crowded field with many admired companies and a ""Johnny come lately."" I will do my best to present both sides of the argument.What's for dinner and how is it different than the other dinners being served?I'm not going to attempt to reprise everything that was presented at the analyst day. It would be tedious in the extreme and not totally relevant in trying to decide if TDC might be a good stock to own. I do think it is relevant to note that the company has shifted its focus rather dramatically from that of selling hardware (the Teradata enterprise data warehouse) to selling software and to attempting to assume the ""trusted advisor"" role with regards to the ways and means its users engage with data. Obviously, selling software is not the same financially as selling software running on optimized hardware but it significantly extends the scope of the available market. I leave the statistics for another day.I also think it is important to note that the company, in somewhat of a stealth mode, has spent the last three years developing applications and functionality that is optimized for the cloud. Most investors do not perceive of TDC solutions as a cloud based set of technologies. And I wonder just how many users think of Teradata as a cloud-based analytics company. It is really a bit of a conundrum. A lowly valued, almost left for dead vendor, whose products seem to be amongst those of industry leaders. The conundrum goes on in that the company is now forecasting that this old, broken down nag is supposed to morph into a thoroughbred stallion with 20% growth. Should you believe the forecast? Is it possible or just another forlorn hope? I think it to be quite possible.Teradata is a company that has been known for offering multiple types of hardware that offered users multiple levels of performance. Teradata used to talk about 'floorsweeps"" where users replaced their hardware so they could analyze more data faster. The company has recently introduced a replacement for all of its older hardware called IntelliFlex. IntelliFlex is the company's new hardware offering and it offers users the capability of being able to get exactly the performance that they need in increments without any significant physical migration. It eliminates a significant objection that users have had for years when considering Teradata.In addition to IntelliFlex, the company discussed its new deployment options which are about as broadly based as those offered by any of its competitors and can encompass all user preferences. The deployment options range the gamut from offerings that are traditional, on-prem, to the private cloud of a user. It has options that allow users to acquire software that run on commodity hardware, users can run the software TDC software on the Teradata cloud and in a Teradata managed data center. Most lately, the company has made Teradata software available on both AWS and on Azure (announced but not yet delivered). These offerings are pretty significant business transformations for the company and are significantly different than what was actually available 12 months ago.One of the more interesting transformations the company is undertaking is the use of its new pricing schema to normalize for hardware performance. Teradata is offering its software in units called Tcores. Each Tcore provides the same level of work as another Tcore. It basically takes 4X the number of nodes on AWS for a user to get the performance available on the IntelliFlex hardware. So, the pricing schema normalizes for that difference such that the cost to a user for the TDC software (Tcores) is normalized across the deployment options. In terms of the way users want to buy these days, when everything is basically mix and match, it is a packaging nirvana that is not currently offered elsewhere. I just do not see TDC competitors offering the equivalent of Tcores as they have no interest in enhancing that kind of user choice. I am not sure I have seen this exact schema used elsewhere to price software although it makes sense in the very hybrid world that has emerged.The other major new deliverable that again is quite different than what TDC has sold in the past is what the company describes as its software bundles. Again, I do not want to take much time in trying to explain the specifics of the different bundles, but the company has put its software products into a set of pre-defined bundles that users can purchase and use without significant additional customization. In the past, many analytical projects, including those sold by TDC, failed because of the complexities inherent in customization the solutions so that they could be used by customers. This is an attempt to deal with that problem and to give potential users a better idea of the costs of the projects and the capabilities they are trying to buy. The bundles are coming in different tiers which basically allow users to migrate from a tier for developers to the equivalent of what today would be called a Teradata enterprise data warehouse.The company announced that it is essentially converting itself to a subscription-based company. There have been more than a few conversions of software companies from on-prem to subscription. The additional complexity here is that heretofore TDC priced its solutions with much of its revenue and customer cost coming from the sales of hardware. So, hardware revenues will be dramatically contracting and software consumption costs will be rising.One analog that might be illustrative to readers is the transformation of Aspen Tech (NASDAQ:AZPN) which went from a more or less traditional software model to one based entirely on subscriptions and to one that used ""token"" to facilitate capacity growth. Think of the Tcores as similar to the Aspen tokens, although they are far more complex because they are normalized for performance and because they represent storage capacity as well as application performance. It will be a bit of a challenge, I imagine, to insure that both customers and TDC sales people understand just how they can buy what it is that TDC has to sell.Most of the conversions in the software world have been quite successful - Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is the poster child, but then Aspen has been hugely successful, PTC is seen as successful (that is a whole separate discussion), Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) in a work in progress with positive early signs, Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) is seemingly nearing the end of its transition and of course the larger application vendors such as SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) have been undergoing somewhat similar transitions. Investing in transitions has been a reasonable strategy and I expect that will remain the case.I think it would be difficult for analysts to fault TDC for undertaking the transition although the issues of what the optics are going to look like and whether the transitions will generate more revenue for the company need to be addressed. Given that TDC has a very loyal base of users (see this report), I think the odds on the company having a successful transition that winds up in generating substantially greater revenues over time is very high.The company made some very bold assertions as to competitive price/performance vis-à-vis Oracle, I presume, although the name of the competitor was redacted. It ran a demo at its event to highlight what its systems could do when compared to those of an unnamed competitor. Does TDC really have a price/performance advantage of 20X running typical queries on AWS? I don't know that I can document that - but I would be surprised if it didn't offer very significant price/performance advantages vis-a vis its major competitors. Oracle's analytics are meant to be run on Oracle hardware called Exadata; absent that, they are likely not to be optimized to run in third-party environments - that is simply not the Oracle way.It is probably important to understand that TDC for years has been focused on providing its users with very high performance at both scale and complexity. TDC does not have the same level of price/performance advantage when dealing with simpler, less complex workloads, but of course the world in analytics seems to be moving to greater and greater levels of complexity which often shade into deep learning and artificial intelligence.I have tried to prioritize what is important and what is not. Needless to say, a presentation that has a 43-page single spaced transcript was far longer than what I have presented in terms of its review as to what is happening and being developed by Teradata. But I think the net of what I'm trying to convey is the company certainly appears to me to have the technology that it needs to be successful in a large and growing space. And that is really all any of us needs to know when it comes to evaluating whether TDC shares are a good investment.Much of the success of an IT vendor is marketing and perception. I held positions in which my job consisted to attempts to persuade users that a sow's ear was a silk purse. Those positions were not the most edifying of my work assignments.As I see it, TDC marketing has a much simpler task. What Teradata has to sell is pretty straightforward. The key is in developing user perceptions and buzz in the marketplace. That is still very much a work in progress. The table has been laid and there are lots of attractive dishes on the menu. But nothing really matters if the guests don't show up for dinner. I think it is time to turn to that subject and see how the guests become aware of the feast and if there are some conclusions that might be drawn.Are Teradata's reservations lines busy?Some readers are going to wonder here why that should be a question. The lines are not busy because the revenue is declining and the company is forecasting some pretty weak performance. But there may be some reasons that changes the view investors ought to have. Teradata has been in the Gartner Leader's Quadrant for Data Warehouse and Data Management solutions for analytics for many years now. Oracle, IBM, SAP and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are also in the leaders quadrant. While Gartner is not known, perhaps, as the end all and be all of vendor analysis, it is worth quoting a couple of things.On the one hand, Gartner says that ""Teradata has continued to evolve its offering to meet the demands of the changing market, with the Teradata Cloud, Teradata on AWS, and Aster Analytics on Hadoop… This new approach offers more flexibility to clients and creates the opportunity to adopt Teradata products separately. This is important as organizations increasingly look for ""best fit"" engineering approaches."" The other side of the equation is that Teradata continues to face challenges in terms of sales execution, even though it is addressing market demands with new offerings. On the other hand, feedback from existing Teradata customers gathered during interactions with users of Gartner's inquiry services and from Gartner surveys indicates an above average customer experience, especially for the delivery of professional services.""In the many years in which I was in the IT business myself, and afterwards when I analyzed the space, I have often wondered that more isn't made about go-to-market strategies. The fact is that it seems very clear to me that Teradata's biggest problems have been in such areas as packaging, pricing go-to-market strategies and not in technology or user satisfaction or in basic demand for what the company has to sell. I think that the key to TDC being successful in its transformation will be its change in its go-to-market strategy which will now be based on a concept best known as that of becoming a ""trusted advisor.""Many times, companies can have great technology in one area or the other but their strength is that they do lots of things quite well rather than trying to do one or two things perfectly. The basic thing that Teradata will be trying to sell is not some unique bit of technology or the other, but its ability to efficiently execute a variety of different use cases either independently or working with each other. That may sound like a bland ingredient for a special sauce, but it packs a lot of wallop as a flavor when people get to sample the food.That is part of the go-to-market strategy for TDC. The other part of the go-to market strategy is for the company to better align what it is trying to sell with what its user target wants to buy. That is quite a bit more complex than it might sound. In fact, becoming a trusted advisor takes significant investment and cultural transformation that is not the easiest thing to pull off.It is also quite a bit more complex than the typical structure most companies use to sell their solutions. This is a strategy that is more about solving business problems for users and less about selling hardware or even a piece of software. Lots of people talk about this kind of a model, but the temptation that salesman have to sell is pretty fierce and it takes lots of discipline to stick to this model. It is often referred to as a ""trusted advisor"" model, and I have read about it far more often than I have seen it executed successfully.Needless to say, the company has had some experience with and success with this model or it wouldn't be presented at an analyst meeting. From time to time, I have known TDC salesman. There has been plenty of sales force turnover and I have had the benefit of some introductions along the way. Lots of TDC sales people have been frustrated in the past with their leadership and with the priorities they have been asked to address. This kind of selling is dramatically different than that which the company and its sales team have dealt with heretofore.I think this is a challenging strategy to implement and to execute although the ultimate benefits to both TDC users and to TDC itself are very substantial. But it is not something that has many analogs to which a writer can point and say it is going to be just like that. Teradata software is capable of being used as a facilitator in the development of a complex decision making environment. To an extent, that means that the company has to gain the trust of its users in trying to explain to them the use cases that will have the highest ROIs. I think there is a reasonable chance that this process will be successful in some significant number of customers. But I would regard this as the riskiest component of the transition and the one that will most likely be subject to modification along the way.What is the forecast for user consumption of the meals? How can the forecast be trusted?It is important to note that analysts do not believe the company is going to fulfill the forecast it has made. If the readers of this article believe that the case the company made has a significant probability of being realized, then the rewards are huge because without exception, the analyst community is highly skeptical. The company has forecast that overall revenues for 2016 are going to be about $2.3 billion, which will be a shrinkage of 10%. Analysts are forecasting a further shrinkage of 3.6% in 2017, essentially consistent with the company forecast provided during the course of the analyst day. It is likely that this forecast for headline shrinkage was the factor that produced negative share price performance in the wake of the meeting.Subsequent to the trough forecast in 2017, the company is forecasting that revenues are going to grow by more than 80% in the succeeding four years which a CAGR of about 16%. And the CAGR encompasses the shift of essentially all of the company's product revenues to a recurring revenue basis. The company's free cash flow forecast for 2021 is $600 million. Finally, the company is forecasting that at the end of this transformation, it will be set for years of 20% growth. No one can say that these are not audacious goals - indeed some of the folks at the analyst meeting said just that. It is a high bar and no one believes it and that is the basic reason, I think why the shares are valued at current levels.I am not going to even attempt to handicap the probabilities of the company's growth after 2021. There are many analyst forecast for analytics and big data. I do not think that the company is forecasting much more than that it will return to the days seen earlier this decade when it was leading the industry at the dawn of the big data era. Napoleon and Patton have been credited with the saying ""L'audace, l'audace, toujours l'audace."" (The saying was actually first used by Danton, another leader of the French Revolution who met a sticky end. Come to that, so did both Napoleon and Patton.) This is certainly that kind of a strategy but it worked for both Napoleon and for Patton more often than not. The difference here, at least as I can see it, is that the downside is not so severe.The company is adopting its new model for pricing pretty much cold turkey as of 1/1/17 and inevitably that is going to lead to some kind of significant revenue decline in 2017 - the company is forecasting 5%-10% which is quite a bit larger than it might seem as TDC gets only 37% of its revenues from the sales of products. Essentially, the company is forecasting that its reported product revenues could drop by 50% next year in the extreme case, and of course some analysts are simply frightened by that kind of transformation.Based on what was said at the analyst meeting, the company will start to report bookings and bookings growth and the CFO spoke to the fact that bookings will be the key leading indicator for reported revenue growth. In analog terms, this company will be reporting and emphasizing the same metrics that one looks at in terms of evaluating Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) or Workday (NYSE:WDAY). These include reported revenues, deferred revenues and the unbooked contract value. I believe that in relatively short order, both analysts and investors will become focused on this performance and not on the performance of headline revenues.To use a real analog, PTC has worked very well as a stock (up by 44% YTD) simply by reporting what I might consider to be a very tendentious bookings metric. The sign posts for success for TDC's transformation will be visible enough in 2017 even with declines in revenues, gross margins and EPS. The company has forecast that it will record bookings growth in 2017 and if that works out - and I think it will - that ought to be enough for the shares to start appreciating as well.The company, in order to realize the go-to-market strategy with high-level teams and more of an emphasis on problem solving than on selling boxes, is going to see sales and marketing costs take back all of the cost savings it has realized this year in 2017 and to exceed the levels the company had at its peak. Becoming a ""trusted advisor"" and finding and paying the right people to occupy the new roles that are being created is an expensive proposition. Again, this is a strategy has apparently been poorly received by both analysts and investors.Investors should recognize the risk management is taking to bring about its transformation. Significant risk, to be sure; huge reward for success since this team is thought to have far worse odds for success than did the Cubs when they were down three games to one last month.The fact is that most analysts, given their backgrounds, do not like high bars, and to an extent, this bar is high and almost certainly higher than what it needs to be for the shares to double or more. That is, I believe, part or even most of the reason as to why the shares reacted poorly in the wake of what otherwise has to be considered a thorough and upbeat analyst day."
3603046,41741,2015-10-26T10:23:14-04:00,Shares of TDC have been taking a beating.The company still operates in one of the hottest industries in software.It has a strong position but competition is creating hiccups.The answer is to consolidate the industry.,"Is Teradata (NYSE:TDC) really the ultimate activist investor stock? First, what's it to do? It operates in the buyout frenzied and activist ridden big data space.TDC runs data analytic platforms, which are software and hardware for data warehousing and big data analytics/intelligence. Its customers span various industries, including financial services, healthcare, insurance, media, retail and manufacturing.However, it has fallen on hard times, with shares are down 35% for the last year.Consolidation wise, there's a lot of action in the software space right now, with Dell getting bought by EMC (EMC), Informatica taken private, Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) is looking to spin off its GoTo suite and TIBCO is getting bought. Where does that leave TDC? In all likelihood, it's going to follow the path of Informatica in getting bought out. Informatica was a prize, with PE firms Permira and Canada Pension Plan winning the bid. But Thoma Bravo and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan were involved in the bidding.Managing the data that's pouring from mobile devices and servers is a big and growing business. There's a big market for companies that can do data cleanup and sorting.Activist impetusElliott Management has been the most active name in the space, taking on the likes of Riverbed, Juniper (NYSE:JNPR), Informatica, Citrix and EMC. Elliott could be the impetus at TDC, but there's no doubt that there's more redefinition of the data management industry to come.The legacy days of selling on-site license-based services are over. The shift is toward big data, the cloud and open source. The key thesis is that the industry is ripe for further consolidation. Private equity has shown an interest in the space.In the meantimeTDC should benefit from strengthening IT budgets and a turnaround in regions that have been volatile - like Brazil, Russia, India and China. 2Q earnings were a big disappointment with revenues falling and earnings coming in below consensus, plus concerns over execution and competition are big overhangs for TDC.It appears TDC got ahead of itself in executing as it looked to capitalize on the strong growth in data volume. But overall growth for the industry doesn't appear to be slowing as cheap storage and more connected devices are adding to the need for data management and analytics.TDC also is moving into (being forced) into other areas of the market where it doesn't have a competitive advantage. But bigger picture, the company is amidst a transition. It's trying to switch to open source tech and looking to become more vertical, ultimately cannibalizing its high-margin products to sell open source tech like Hadoop. So management's focus is now on supporting Hadoop.Other changes an activist could push forThere are other ways to create value at TDC besides pushing for a buyout. This starts with a management shakeup. CEO Mike Koehler has been the head of the company since it spun off from NCR (NYSE:NCR) in 2007 and was running the company even before that. Much of the senior management team has been there for well over a decade.And as alluded above, management's focus has been lackluster. The company is spending more to support Hadoop. Meanwhile, the Hadoop ecosystem is maturing and pressuring gross margins.How to think about the valuationShares trade at 9.9x EV/free cash flow, which is a hefty discount to the software industry as a whole - roughly 16x. That's also a discount to the five-year average that's close to 20x.On a P/E basis, it's trading at under 15x next year's earnings, and again, a sizable discount to the near 30x industry average and its own 20x five-year average.Assuming TDC gets closer to peers at 15x EV/FCF over the next 12 months, shares should get back to $37.Thinking about it another way, TDC trades at less than 6x forward EV/EBITDA but recall that TIBCO went private at 17x EV/EBITDA.Bottom lineThe big risks are that IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) get more ruthless to take share from the smaller guys. Then there's the myriad of smaller players looking to get in on the growth.In truth, management needs to change its focus now toward the growth segments, i.e. big data, marketing analytics and the cloud. This is a must before it loses out on its large installed base in data warehousing. The need for an activist here is real to either force a new course or get the company consolidated into a better-run company."

The newsletter will be on hiatus until Tuesday, May 17.Notable Tech NewsFacebook partners with an ad agency to create a morning live video show - Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) aggressive live video efforts extend to creating sponsored programming. The company is partnering with ad agency DigitasLBi to create Rise and Shine, described by AdWeek as ""a livestreamed morning 'feed show' on Facebook that will include local weather, exercise workouts, recipes and more."" The site adds Rise and Shine will air 3-5 times a week, and be shown on Facebook's news feed, a brand sponsor's page, and on Messenger, where users will be able to subscribe to a Messenger bot alerting them to when new content from the show is available.DigitasLBi will own the show's talent and programming, and work to find brand sponsors. Content can be ""customized"" according to a brand's needs. Facebook exec Keenan Pridmore: ""It will appear in those morning wake-up hours where you are getting up, you could use a little [content] to get you going. Something to get you laughing, smiling, thinking."" Are more sponsored shows on tap? Facebook is already paying media firms such as BuzzFeed the NYT, and Vox Media to create original content for its Live streaming service. It has also reportedly promised publishers Live videos will support ads, though not the pre-roll video ads one sees quite often on YouTube.Nvidia launches high-end desktop GPUs based on its new Pascal architecture, prices aggressively - With 9 TFLOPs of processing power, Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) $599 GeForce GTX 1080 surpasses the Titan X (based on the older Maxwell architecture, delivers 7 TFLOPs, and has been priced at $999) as the company's most powerful PC GPU. Nvidia has also launched a slightly less powerful card (the $379 GTX 1070) that's also promised to outperform the 1070, and is expected to launch a new flagship GPU (presumably under the Titan name) in late 2016 or early 2017.Just as impressive as Nvidia's price/performance figures are the various other features provided to deliver a superior user experience. With the help of TSMC's 16nm manufacturing process - Maxwell GPUs rely on an older 28nm process - and a revamped power supply, the 1080 delivers a major improvement in peak-to-peak power efficiency relative to the Titan X (120mV vs. 209mV). Nvidia has also launched simultaneous multi-projection, a technology that promises to deliver better performance and a superior gaming experience when using either a VR headset or multiple PC monitors. And a solution called Ansel lets gamers take screenshots from different parts of a game scene, as well as 360° panoramic screenshots, at a whopping 4.5 gigapixels (4,500 megapixels).Nvidia promises the $599 GeForce GTX 1080 will easily outperform the $999 Titan X, in spite of consuming much less power.It doesn't look like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) will have anything that can counter Nvidia in the high-end desktop GPU market in the near term. The company's upcoming Polaris GPUs appear to be aimed at notebooks and ""mainstream"" desktops - AMD has talked up Polaris' power efficiency improvements relative to existing products, but it looks like Nvidia's Pascal GPUs are no slouch in that department either. For now, Nvidia looks set to continue dominating a growing, high-margin, gaming GPU market that helped the company's total GPU revenue rise 10% Y/Y in its January quarter in spite of a very weak PC market. And much as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is attempting to fend off ARM server CPU rivals by creating platform-level solutions for servers relying on its Xeon CPUs, Nvidia is working to cement its high-end GPU leadership by creating selling points other than raw performance.Apple is (apparently) looking to lease 800K square feet for self-driving car R&D - Victor Coleman, CEO of Bay Area real estate owner Hudson Pacific Properties (NYSE:HPP), mentioned in his company's Q1 earnings call Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is ""looking to take down"" 800K sq. feet of space for autonomous car R&D. He added Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is looking to add 400K sq. feet for its own self-driving car efforts.Uber-secretive Apple probably isn't thrilled to see Coleman's disclosure. Regardless, it provides fresh evidence Apple's car efforts extend to autonomous driving. The Guardian reported last August Apple is looking for a place to test self-driving cars. The WSJ has also reported Apple is interested in autonomous driving, while adding its first car (currently rumored to have a 2019 target launch date) isn't expected to be fully autonomous.Digitimes: TSMC begins taping out the design for Apple's A11 processor, is expected to get 2/3 of orders - Digitimes (based out of Taiwan) is generally good about reporting on local chip foundry giant TSMC's (NYSE:TSM) plans. This time, it reports TSMC has begun the design tape-out process for Apple's A11 processor (expected to go into the iPhone 7S), and could begin producing the chip by Q2 2017. It adds TSMC is likely to get about 2/3 of Apple's A11 orders - Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), which along with TSMC is handling production of the A9 (found in the iPhone 6S), is a likely candidate to get the rest.The A11 is expected to use TSMC's (and perhaps Samsung's?) next-gen 10nm manufacturing process. The A9 relies on 16nm processes, and the A10 is expected to as well. TSMC is expected to be the sole supplier for the A10.AMD re-enters SSD market with low-cost Radeon R3 SSDs - The SSDs aren't technically made by AMD, but by a company called Galt. Capacities range from 120GB-960GB, with the 120GB drive costing a mere $40.99 and the 480GB drive a fairly inexpensive $136.99. A reminder of how competitive the SSD market is - unlike hard drives, where manufacturing plants give Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) a barrier to entry, plenty of OEMs can put together SSDs using third-party NAND flash memory and controller chips.Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Seagate's SandForce unit are major controller suppliers to independent SSD vendors. SSD vendors producing their own NAND chips, such as Intel, Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), and SanDisk (SNDK - soon to be part of Western Digital) might have the best chance to differentiate over the long run.Bloomberg: Chinese ride-sharing leader Didi Kuaidi close to raising $2B at $25B valuation - The reported funding round features a much higher valuation than the $16.5B Didi Kuaidi (DIDI) obtained in 2015, when it raised $3B. The company is in pitched battle with Uber (NYSE:UBER) for Chinese ride-sharing leadership. Uber, which not long ago raised funds at a $62.5B valuation, has said it's losing over $1B/year in China. SA contributor Andrew Mok just argued Uber is well-positioned to win in China.New app allows Amazon's Alexa voice assistant to be accessed via iPhones - Until now, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa voice assistant was only accessible via the company's Echo speakers/voice assistants and Fire TV devices. By leveraging Amazon's Alexa API, startup Lexi has launched a $4.99 iOS app that lets users access Alexa on the go. It supports most, but not all, of the voice assistant's features.It might be just a matter of time before Amazon launches a free Alexa app for iOS/Android. Thanks to features added by third-party developers through the API and the popularity of the Echo line - unlike smartphone-based voice assistants, plugged-in Echo devices don't need an activation phrase to turn Alexa on - Alexa has joined Google Now, Siri, and Cortana as a formidable player in the voice assistant wars.Earnings NewsTeradata rises 15% over two days after Q1 beat, strong EPS guidance, and CEO change - Teradata (NYSE:TDC), a major player in the traditional data warehousing hardware/software space, has had a rough couple of years as sales became pressured by a mixture of stiff competition from traditional rivals Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), spending on analytics projects involving technologies used to handle unstructured data such as Hadoop and NoSQL (Teradata's projects have historically involved structured data), and the arrival of low-cost cloud alternatives such as Amazon's RedShift and Microsoft's SQL Data Warehouse. Teradata has launched its own Hadoop/NoSQL and cloud offerings, but plenty of competition exists.Teradata's results and guidance, along with the replacement of long-time CEO Mike Koehler with director Vic Lund (once the CEO of IBM-acquired software firm DemandTec), appears to be fueling hopes a turnaround is possible - Lund says accelerating Teradata's ""transformation efforts"" is a priority. There might also be speculation Lund will be willing to put Teradata up for sale - many mid-sized enterprise tech firms, including data warehousing software rival Informatica, have been acquired by P-E firms in recent years. Any prospective buyer will be taking in a business that's still seeing major top-line pressures - in spite of the Q1 beat, Teradata's hardware/software revenue (drives future services revenue) fell 20% Y/Y last quarter.Sierra Wireless soars after Q1 beat and full-year guidance reiteration - From late 2012 to late 2014, Sierra Wireless (NASDAQ:SWIR) rose over 6x as investors came to view the company - it provides modems, gateways, software, and (with the help of multiple acquisitions) connectivity services that can be used in IoT deployments - as an alluring IoT play. Since then, shares have lost over 60% of their value thanks to earnings disappointments and concerns about the health of Sierra's traditional 3G/4G modem business (faces stiff competition). Against that backdrop, the company's Q1 numbers and guidance reiteration have been well-received. Shares still only go for 0.9x a 2016 sales consensus of $643.7M.Control4 surges after Q1 beat and full-year guidance reiteration - Another case of a company that once flew higher on enthusiasm about its exposure to a much-hyped market (in Control4's case, home automation), but have since come back to earth. Markets gave a thumbs-up to Control4's (NASDAQ:CTRL) 24% Y/Y organic Q1 revenue growth (growth was 34% after accounting for the purchase of home automation networking hardware firm Pakedge), and Control4's comments about strong uptake for its new EA-series smart home controllers. Shares go for just 10.3x a 2017 EPS consensus of $0.77.Control4's high-end EA-5 smart home controllerImperva plunges on soft Q2 sales guidance - While FireEye's (NASDAQ:FEYE) post-earnings selloff (covered on Friday) received more attention, security tech peer Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV) fell even more after providing a light Q2 sales outlook blamed on European execution and near-term weakness in the company's web application firewall (""WAF"") business - the WAF market is fairly competitive, with other notable players including F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV), Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS), Barracuda Networks (NYSE:CUDA), and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT). Top-line growth was still fairly strong in Q2: Product/subscription revenue rose 45% Y/Y, and the deferred revenue balance rose 29%.Notable Tech Commentary and ReportsUBS: iPhone 7 interest stronger than year-ago iPhone 6S interest - A survey of 6,336 smartphone users in the U.S., U.K., Germany, China, and Japan found more people saying they're ""very likely"" or ""somewhat likely"" to buy an iPhone 7 than were willing to say the same for an iPhone 6S a year ago. Interest is still lower than that seen for the iPhone 6 two years ago, when there was considerable pent-up demand for larger iPhones.Given Apple is trading near 2-year lows after having reported iPhone unit shipments fell 19% Y/Y in calendar Q1 (while guiding for further weakness in Q2), the survey figures are relatively encouraging, and highlight how consumers have come to expect bigger upgrades in upgrade years featuring number changes. A March/April U.S. Goldman survey also pointed to strong iPhone 7 interest.It's now, of course, up to Apple to deliver an iPhone 7 that lives up to expectations - the biggest improvement mentioned thus far by the rumor mill is the addition of a dual-camera array that enables high-quality images and perhaps the ability to adjust focus/depth-of-field after a photo is taken. OLED displays, over-the-air wireless charging, and front-and-glass back panels could be scheduled for 2017.Tune: 69% of smartphone users would pay nothing to remove ads - Tune, a mobile analytics, firm, surveyed ~4,000 users about how much they'd pay to remove all ads from their apps (if that was possible). 69.3% said they'd pay nothing, 11.3% said $1/year, 10.4% $1/month, 4.5% $1/week, and 4.5% $1/day.Not great figures for online publishers contending with ad-blocking and often exploring ways to get readers to pay ad-free and non-paywalled content. They might be more encouraging for Google and Facebook, who each provide publishers with a slew of tools and services for running targeted ads on their sites and apps.Bloomberg: Zeroing in on FireEye - Makes the case that FireEye , which fell 19% on Friday after posting mixed results, issuing light sales guidance, and announcing a CEO change, could be a buyout target at current depressed levels. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which competes with FireEye and has suggested it's up for more security M&A, is mentioned as a potential acquirer.While issues related to competition and sales execution have grown plenty over the last year, FireEye still has malware-detection and endpoint-protection products that are often considered best-of-breed, as well as an incident-response services unit often called upon to probe major data breaches. Shares currently trade for 2.1x the midpoint of FireEye's 2016 billings guidance range.WSJ: Square Faces Questions on Lending Strategy - On a day Square (NYSE:SQ) closed down 21.7% following its Q1 results, the WSJ took a look at Square's disclosure (and related investor concerns) that it saw ""more challenging credit-market conditions"" for its Square Capital loan/cash-advance business for merchants. Two unnamed investors delayed providing Square Capital funding. RBC's Mark Mahaney estimates Square's total software/data products revenue, which includes Square Capital fell $2M short of consensus estimates at $24M. It was still up 197% Y/Y.VentureBeat: An interview with Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and content chief Ted Sarandos - The interview doesn't feature any earth-shaking revelations, but does help shine a light on Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) strategic thinking. It notes Netflix's investments in AI/machine learning to improve content recommendations, its use of A/B testing to optimize how content is shown, and its interest in financing original content that has global appeal. Narcos, a Netflix original about Colombian druglord Pablo Escobar, is apparently big in Germany.Netflix says it will release 600 hours of original programming this year, twice what it released last year. Hastings: ""We'd like to be as popular in the world as in the U.S., to be in one-third of households seven years from now."" For now, 47M of Netflix's 81M global subscribers are still in the U.S.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

2787875,61281,2014-12-30T10:22:57-05:00,"In 2014, Teradata acquired four big-data companies specializing in Hadoop.Each acquired company adds a different Hadoop capability to Teradata and allows the company to include added-value Hadoop features in its core business.Teradata increased its profit distribution through share repurchases.Increased buybacks suggest the company believes it will increase profits in the future, which will have a positive impact on its share price.","Teradata (NYSE:TDC), the data warehousing leader, recently announced its fourth acquisition in 2014. In a press release, the company announced it had acquired RainStor, a privately held company specializing in online big data archiving on Hadoop. Along with Think Big Analytics, Hadapt and Revelytix, Rainstor was acquired by Teradata as part of its expansion strategy into the Hadoop market.Hadoop, formally named Apache Hadoop, is an open-source framework that allow organizations to optimize their data processing and database utilization, thus saving storage space and costs. Hadoop is one of the hottest segments in the big-data market, getting a lot of attention after the Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP) IPO.Hortonworks is one of the three principal players in the Hadoop market together with Cloudera and MapR. Teradata was an early investor in Hortonworks and acquired a stake of 8.3% during three funding rounds pre-IPO between November 2011 and July 2014.Each startup that Teradata acquired this year in the Hadoop market has a different specialization that allows Teradata to have a comprehensive Hadoop offering. Rainstor will enable Teradata to improve its online big data archiving on Hadoop, Hadapt's acquisition will add SQL-on-Hadoop capabilities to Teradata, and Revelytix's acquisition will allow Teradata to implement its unique metadata management technology. On top of these technological advantages, Teradata also invested in improving its Hadoop professional services through the Think Big Analytics acquisition.As many Hadoop companies struggle on the correct business model to generate revenues from the open-source framework, it seems that Teradata found a way to monetize Hadoop as part of its core business. With the Hadoop acquisitions, Teradata will be able to offer its data warehousing customers additional Hadoop features that can optimize their storage and save costs for them. As each startup that Teradata acquired has a different specialization in the Hadoop market, it allows Teradata to have a comprehensive Hadoop offering that can help the company match each customer with the solution that fits that individual customer.Adding Hadoop to Teradata's offering is not just a nice-to-have feature that customers can enjoy, but it brings real added value to Teradata clients and allows them to save storage costs by using Teradata. Teradata has a stable PnL with minimal fluctuations that yielded only a 1% quarterly revenue growth rate since the beginning of 2013. Every quarter, Teradata generates an average of $360M in revenue, and its net profit grows at a rate of 0.4%. The company's low growth rate also is reflected in its stock price, which fluctuates around $43.50. As shown in chart 1 below, Teradata's stock yielded a 0.53% year-to-date return rate in 2014.The sharp ups and downs in this year's stock price are partially driven by enterprise software vendors' rallies and drops since the beginning of the year and partially by better than expected quarterly results.In the middle of December, Teradata announced an addition of $300M to the company's repurchase program, increasing the total amount of cash dedicated for buybacks to $450M. Like dividends, a stock repurchase is a way for businesses to distribute profits to shareholders, and companies can choose the buyback method over the dividend method to distribute its profits. Such an expansion of the buyback program indicates an increase in the amount Teradata is expected to distribute to its shareholders. As Teradata's increase in its buyback program is significant, it may be suggesting to investors that it expects to maintain current profits and possibly increase them.As profit increase is reflected in the share price through the P/E ratio, it is reasonable to assume that Teradata's management is expecting profits to rise in the future, and hence share price should follow. There is no indication that the growth in the buyback program is based on the company's estimation regarding expected revenues or profits from the recent Hadoop acquisitions, but it will probably play some role in that decision on top of other growth areas within the company's core business.ConclusionTeradata made a significant leap into the evolving Hadoop market by completing four acquisitions in 2014. These acquisitions will allow Teradata to offer added value Hadoop features to its customers and enable them to save storage costs by using Teradata's solution. The Hadoop features should attract new clients to Teradata that will drive higher revenues for the company in the future.Furthermore, Teradata increased its share repurchase program by $300M, and that assumes that the company will at least keep its current profit level. However, with the recent Hadoop acquisitions and the direction the company took toward the big data market, it is only reasonable that it will increase profits in the upcoming year.Teradata's focus on the emerging big data and Hadoop markets, recent acquisitions and increased buyback plan make it an excellent watchlist addition to those interested in the big data or enterprise software markets. Following Teradata's Q4 results and its 2015 guidance, I will be able to determine whether it is a buy, or it should remain in the watchlist. I will then publish a revised analysis."
2972416,23471,2015-03-04T09:58:55-05:00,"TDC is suitable for Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is fairly valued at the present time.The market is implying a 5.49% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, within a margin of safety relative to the rate the company has seen in recent years.","Teradata Corporation (NYSE:TDC) should attract all Enterprising Investors particularly due to the company's stable earnings growth over the last few years. That said, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to determine a potential investment's merits. Here's an updated look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.This model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.TDC data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests, or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - December 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryTeradata Corporation does not pay a dividend.ConclusionTeradata Corporation should satisfy the Enterprising Investor but not the Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio, lack of dividends and the high PB ratio. The Enterprising Investor is only concerned by the lack of dividends. Therefore, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.47 in 2010 to $2.26 for 2014. This is a strong and impressive level of demonstrated growth, which is in line with the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 5.49% over the next 7-10 years. The ModernGraham valuation model, therefore, returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling within a margin of safety relative to the current price, indicating the company is fairly valued at the present time."
4010165,98236,2016-10-04T22:30:14-04:00,"Yesterday, the UBS analyst that covers the IT space downgraded the shares of Teradata from hold to sell with a $27 price target.This article attempts to look at the logic of the downgrade and finds it wanting to say the least.Teradata is not perceived as a company without its share of problems - which is why it has a new CEO and is in the midst of a long overdue transition.Most of the quotes in the downgrade presented positive rather than negative observations regarding the company's position.The company has one of the highest free cash flow yields in the enterprise software space making the potential for it to be a consolidation target very substantial.","Teradata (NYSE:TDC) - The shares can certainly provide holders with some kicks over timeAs is the case with choosing betwixt and between various investment opportunities, it is equally difficult to choose between the songwriters of the era of American standards. The title and the lead-in here come from a song called ""I get a kick out of you"" written by Cole Porter and originally sung by Ethel Merman in 1934 in a show called ""Anything Goes."" Since then, it has been reprised more times than can be readily recounted. When the show was made into a movie, the line, ""I get no kick from cocaine"" was considered risqué. How times change.In 1974, the song was featured in the film called ""Blazing Saddles"" in which it was called ""I get no kick from Champagne."" By that time, Cole Porter had been buried for 10 years and his career had been over for more time than that. Given that Blazing Saddles was a satiric comedy, perhaps the title of the song which became ""I get no kick from champagne"" was meant sarcastically. Porter was the richest and most sybaritic composers of his era and never stinted on the good stuff, either in alcohol or anything else. His Palazzo in Venice where he lived in the 1920s is one of the more opulent dwellings in that city although it has been turned into an art museum.Was Cole Porter the best song writer of his era. Well, who can say, but I wonder who else might be nominated as a competitor. He has long had my vote and when I walk by another of his homes, the legendary Waldorf Towers, I think I can hear a piano tinkling with one of his songs in the background. I hope the renovation will leave some connection to the period when the Waldorf meant high society.I am sometimes surprised at what motivates highly intelligent men (and a few women) to make the calls that they do. Monday, UBS analyst Brent Thrill announced he was downgrading Teradata shares to Sell from Hold with a price target of $27. The shares dropped 5% in the wake of the downgrade, and are now just 7% above his newly established target. Brent may have been having a disagreeable day as he downgraded Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) shares as well because they are more expensive than rival VMware (NYSE:VMW). I will let that rating change pass uncommented other than to say that investing is not necessarily a zero-sum game, and it is not quite necessary to sell Citrix in order to buy VMW.But in any event, the Teradata downgrade is based on some assertions that kindly put stretching reality and perhaps affording investors with a favorable entry point into the name. As the calendar tells us all, it is October 4th, and hence within a few weeks of the release of quarterly earnings. I am not trying to call the quarter. I would not have anything specific to go on. The last two quarters were very strong, to be sure, relative to very constrained expectations with EPS beats of significant magnitude and some upside to revenue expectations as well. Is the new management trying to create a pattern with a series of beats and raises? I really don't know.The relative performance of Teradata shares so far this yearThe UBS analyst says part of his sell recommendation is based on the over-performance of TDC shares so far in 2016. I imagine most holders lack similar concerns. TDC shares are up about 11% YTD. The index that is supposedly a proxy for enterprise tech shares, the IGV, is also up 11%.When earnings were released in August, and in the wake of an EPS beat in excess of 30% coupled with a beat on revenues, the shares rallied by 10%. That sounds good, but the fact is the shares rallied from very modest levels and were up 7% YTD at that point. The prior quarterly earnings release had featured another significant beat and in turn saw a slightly greater rally in percentage terms. I have recommended TDC shares cautiously at first, but a bit more enthusiastically in the wake of the second earnings beat. But looking at the share prices at the times I wrote my articles on SA convinces me, if I needed much convincing, that TDC has not been an outperformer or has reached stratospheric valuations.Based on the company's recent operating performance and current expectations, clearly TDC shares are cheaper now than they were 6 months ago. It would be hard to suggest that anyone was actually looking for two strong earnings beats 6 months ago, and there was no evidence whatsoever that TDC could staunch declining revenues any time soon. Yes, revenues are still declining, but at a slower rate than had been embodied in estimates. There is an old adage to the effect that you have to stop digging before you start rising. I don't imagine there is anyone who has expectations that TDC has reached much further than the ""stop digging"" phase. So, I think one stated reason for the downgrade is spurious, to say the least, and I will leave it at that for the moment.Does Teradata face either an improvement in financial model expectations or will it face a rocky transition to the cloud?It is interesting I think to try to put two mutually contradictory sets of expectations inside of a single report. Not impossible, I suppose, but interesting. By this time, almost all professional investors are well aware that transitions to the cloud do not produce a strong set of positive headline numbers. What has been true for Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), Aspen (NASDAQ:AZPN), PTC (NASDAQ:PTC), as well as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and even IBM (NYSE:IBM) will be true for this company. As I have written on more than one occasion, the cadence of a move to a ratable model is simply unknowable and unforecastable.But what is equally unknowable is how investors will look at numbers during the transition. From the point of view of investors, ADBE has been a home run, and so have AZPN and so has PTC. If these companies put up huge upside headlines, it is news to me. What they were able to do is to demonstrate that their transitions were in progress and that their proxy numbers for revenues and earnings were progressing well. I do not know that TDC will have the same success - but I think the set-up is in their favor.Just yesterday, PTC pre-released their results for the September quarter. The company reported a bookings upside and an earnings miss. And look at how investors reacted - they sent shares to highs not seen since the tech bubble at the turn of the century.I am not too sure as to what is meant by a rocky transition. If a rocky transition means that TDC will print some headlines that are not pleasing to everyone, I am sure that is true. Most investors have come to understand by now that during transitions, the metric at which to look is bookings. If TDC can put together a story that relates to consistent double-digit bookings growth, the shares are going to have a strong run, and if that happens sooner rather than later and perhaps takes place at the company's Analyst Day scheduled for November 17th, that would be a good thing and not a bad thing, in my opinion.The first thing TDC has to prove is that it has stopped shrinking and that its customers are buying the company's sauce in the new bottles and are willing to buy more of it. Without meaning to be cavalier, if the new CEO, Vic Lund can re-energize the company's sales machine, almost everything else that ails this business and has caused the shares to perform so poorly for so long will get fixed.Some interesting quotationsI have to give the UBS analyst credit. His report is just chocked full of the kind of data I would normally use to write an article recommending the name. If you want to see a fair and balanced report, that somehow lurches to an unusual conclusion, this would be that. So, let's start with the assertion that, ""While customer checks remain resoundingly positive on TDC's foundational robustness, and we cannot deny the surprisingly high degree of customer loyalty…"" That really doesn't seem all that bad and indeed to get to the desired conclusion in the downgrade, the author has to turn the quote on its head and make it do a few other contortions that quotes should never be asked to do.Teradata's core product for many years has been its Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW). For at least the past 5 years, there have been arguments about whether that technology is obsolete and will be brought down by newer ways of storing the data that are used to create strong solutions based on big data and on deep learning models. In fact, one of the jewels in the TDC pantheon is Aster Data, which was bought for $263 million back in 2011. The user base, and doubtless the revenues as well have expanded exponentially. Since 2015, users have been able to run Aster Analytics on Hadoop, which is said to allow users to combine machine learning text, path, pattern, graph and statistics in a single workflow. Although that text is for sure some marketing babble, it is also basically aligned with the major trends in the business intelligence space. Mr. Lund talked about the company's strategy of ""developing world-class cloud capabilities and services… that will provide analytical business solutions that deliver high-impact business outcomes, and to create an environment that supports nimble (Business practice) driving innovation.""I think it is reasonable to assert that if users like the foundation of the TDC solution and they like the company (surprisingly loyal), then providing those users with the solutions they want to buy on a foundation they strongly appreciate and on the platforms, and with contractual arrangements that are the most popular these days, is likely to be a winning strategy… if TDC executes on Mr. Lund's vision.So, what is really the issue. The analyst goes on to write that ""we anticipate continued volatility in financial results based on our views of incrementally stubborn demand softness in the core."" And the analyst suggests that TDC may see slow and ""potentially cannibalistic"" traction with new offerings as well as margin compression from reinvestments among other things.I think it is relatively difficult to rebut those assertions trying to use some specific facts. I have no way of knowing if there is ""incrementally stubborn demand softness in the core."" I do know I would likely write that phrase a bit differently, but the analyst skill set is perhaps not focused on his writing or UBS editors like those kinds of phrases.I think that what the phrase means, regardless of how it is expressed, is that as TDC offers cloud solutions, it will sell less EDW hardware. It would be surprising if that were not the case - I think the word transition means going from one thing to the other, and that will most certainly be the case in this transition.On the other hand, I absolutely do not agree that there should be much question that the kind of integrated analytic solutions that are TDC's offerings, and which perform advanced analytics based on ingesting and dealing with massive streams of Big Data are seeing any kind of demand weakness. It is basically impossible to square the comment that users feel that TDC has foundational robustness with the comment about stubborn demand softness in the core… provided that the company fulfills its product roadmap, which it will likely discuss in some detail in November during its Analyst Day.The transition to ratable sources of revenue is already under way, although the company hasn't yet started to break out the details. During the course of the conference call, the company's CFO, Steve Scheppmann talked about an $11 million deal with a large airline which utilized the company's term rental offering. The company also disclosed that it had closed a significant transaction with a large well-known healthcare company using a utility-based model in which revenue will be recognized based on usage.The CFO went on to say that there are many customers evaluating the usage-based pricing alternative. As he put it, this is not unexpected and is aligned with the company's transformation. ""But, as you likely understand, this will begin to impact our year-over year-revenue comparisons as some of the revenue we would have normally recognized in a given quarter will now be spread over a number of quarters."" To sum up here, the company anticipates cannibalization, it has already experienced cannibalization, and it has embodied the impact of cannibalization in its numbers. It would be helpful going forward if the company developed a bookings metric so that analysts would have some objective basis to establish progress toward a goal of a higher proportion of recurring revenues and could develop meaningful growth rate trends. It would not be surprising to me if such metrics were introduced at Analyst Day.Teradata will likely not have any better luck in forecasting the cadence of its transition to the cloud than anyone else has done. If I had to guess the transition will be swifter and far more sudden than might be the company's current thinking. But that is all anyone can do - guess. My guess, for all it may be worth, partially engendered by the comment about surprising customer loyalty, is that there is a significant level of pent-up demand that will start to drive bookings for EDW solutions on all kinds of platforms and licensing arrangements once the company has a full suite of alternatives available, which is its stated goal and a focus of Mr. Lund as self-identified. There is an open question regarding what reasonable estimate might be for a longer-term growth rate for this company, expressed in the growth of bookings or of ACV but whether it is single digits or low-double digits, it is greater than shrinking.Some years ago, prior to the advent of the cloud and big data repositories such as Hadoop, it was thought that the market space encompassing the EDW might grow in low-double digits. At the moment, the consensus guess is that it will continue to decline as it has for the past few years. Product revenue peaked in 2012 at $1.23 billion and decreased to $1.057 billion last year and are running at a rate of about $900 million for the current year excluding the impact of the sale of the company's marketing application division which was sold on July 1st. Results in Q2 showed a significantly lower level of percentage decline than was the case in Q1. The company, when it gave guidance in August, essentially dropped the Q2 overage from its revenue forecast for the balance of the year, and did so based on its expectations that ratable revenues would rise and diminish reported product revenues. The company is well aware of the issues of revenue cannibalization and its forecast is what it is because management is aware of the tradeoff between ratable revenue and reported revenues. The concept that this is a new thing that will take investors by surprise is itself a bit of a surprise if anyone has been following the company at all carefully.Can Teradata turn itself into a 10% growth business again. It certainly has plenty of competitors in its space and some of them, particularly the Hadoop vendors, have likely taken some market share. But with the market set to grow at a 10% CAGR, and with TDC's market segment within the data warehouse space growing faster than that, then yes - the company ought to return to double-digit growth in bookings or in ACV at some point within the next 12-18 months. It is simply difficult to reconcile user loyalty, user belief in the foundational solution, and a market growing at 10%/year and TDC product revenues declining at some significant rate. I simply do not see that there is any new found evidence of ""incrementally stubborn demand softness in the core."" Indeed, as users become more interested in what they can accomplish with AI applications, then it seems that the exact opposite has been true.A few thoughts on valuationMost of the investors who own TDC these days do so because they perceive it to be a value story. That was true in August and it still is. The company has a market capitalization of about $3.9 billion. Its current cash balance is about $400 million, which leaves an enterprise value of $3.5 billion. As mentioned earlier, the company is forecasting that it will record revenues of around $2.3 billion, including the so-called cannibalization from a revenue mix shift to a ratable model. So that is an EV/S of 1.5X. Again, the current P/E based on the guidance presented in August is for non-GAAP EPS of a bit greater than $2.40 at the mid-point of the range. That is a P/E of 12X. Are those quite deep value metrics? In the tech space they are; outside the tech space, they may not be. Are they levels that call for a sell rating? I simply do not see any specific, new evidence that would yield such a conclusion. If the UBS analyst really knows that Q3 will be a disaster, then of course, the shares are vulnerable. I am simply not aware of any particular news that would cause analysts to reach such a conclusion.The company has a relatively low level of stock-based compensation and that ratio is falling as a percentage of total income. Stock-based comp was 12% of non-GAAP EPS in the first half of the year, and it is forecast to be 15% of the $2.43 EPS forecast for the fiscal year.Overall, the company had cash flow from operations of $350 million for the first half of the year, which is a CFFO margin of 30.5%. if revenues are consistent with guidance, then CFFO for the year will be $700 million. CapEx and additions to capitalized software are running at an annual rate of $100 million, which yields a free cash flow estimate of $600 million and a free cash flow yield of 17%. That is clearly a ratio that marks the shares as having deep value. There are no real outliers in the CFFO generation - it is part of the consequence of shrinking revenues.Again, usually companies with that kind of free cash flow yield are understood to be undergoing a transition or to have a weak outlook when it comes to growth. Investors would seem to be prepared for the company to not put up fantastic headline numbers in the near future or they would surely pay more for the shares.I made my case that TDC shares were a buyback in August. The fact that an analyst decided to downgrade the shares based on what appears to be the filmiest of reasoning, while disappointing to current shareholders, probably presents another entry point for investors who have been waiting for a particular event to consider the shares. I have no particular insight into this quarter, and perhaps this analyst does, although there is no commentary to that effect in his report. But other than that, I think the set-up for share price appreciation is excellent. Expectations remain completely muted. Most investors are well aware that transitions to the cloud are complicated and can play hob with reported numbers. Most analysts will not be nearly as concerned about headlines as they are about bookings and cash flow and those metrics appear to be strong. The company's shares are rated at below hold by analysts and the company has relatively high short interest that rose the prior month. It has a cash flow generation that makes it a reasonable target for private equity consolidators. The shares, at current levels, are anything but extended. Management has articulated a reasonable set of plans to bring Teradata offerings into the modern world with regards to making solutions available on the cloud, via subscriptions and via consumption-based pricing. The company has, as the negative analyst suggested, a customer base that is resoundingly positive on the company's foundational robustness. All of that adds up to a buy and positive alpha, and not a sell. And while I can't foretell the quarter, there are no signs that it was a miss, either."
2492515,66493,2014-09-13T13:18:28-04:00,"Teradata's revenue growth has slowed due to lack luster growth from its Top 50 customers. The Top 50 has slowed revenue growth to below 1% in Q2.Yet, the Top 50's impact on revenue is starting to wane. Additionally, the Top 50's revenue decline is becoming smaller.Teradata's Top 50 has slowed revenue growth, but international markets have been growing double digits. Europe should remain a strong growth engine due to rapid industry growth.The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow rapidly, but Teradata has experienced weakness in Japan. Yet, Japan is stabilizing and China is poised to have a better second half.Teradata's revenue growth has slowed. In order to improve investor sentiment, growth only has to increase a few percentage points which should happen due to rapid growth in several markets.","Teradata Corporation (NYSE:TDC) is a provider of data analysis solutions and applications. Additionally, Teradata provides maintenance and consulting services. Teradata's revenue growth has slowed over the last year and half. From 2009-2013, revenue grew at a CAGR of 12.0%. In 2013, revenue growth slowed to 1.0% and in Q2 2014 revenue growth was only 0.9%. The company's slow growth has caused the stock to fall. Over the last year, the stock has declined nearly 21%. Yet, the stock has only fallen 1.9% year-to-date. The company's slow growth rate and subsequent stock decline appears to have tempered investors' expectations. In order for the stock to recover, Teradata will only need to accelerate revenue growth a couple percentage points. This should happen due to double digit growth in several market segments.Problems In AmericaIn 2014, Teradata has experienced weakness out of the Americas region. Revenue in the Americas region declined 8% in Q2 and is flat for the first half. The decline is being driven by the company's top 50 customers. On the Q2 conference call, CEO Michael Koehler talked about the Top 50 ""we grew outside the top 50 double digits, and the large CapEx purchases and everything else in the top 50 took a decline in the second quarter."" The lack of spending from the Top 50 caused the company's revenue growth to slow to under 1% in Q2. This isn't the first time the Top 50 has impacted revenue growth. The Top 50 has been causing Teradata's revenue to slow for over a year and a half. On the Q4 2013 conference call, Michael Koehler talked about the company's lack luster 2013 revenue growth, ""The largest contributor to the slowing of our revenue growth in 2013 was the decline in revenue from our top 50 customers in the Americas."" The Top 50 has been slowing down growth, but outside the Top 50 revenue has grown double digits.This rapid growth is starting to reduce the impact of the Top 50. On the Q2 conference call, Michael Koehler talked about the Top 50's share of revenue, ""...the top 50 spiked up in 2012 to a point where it was 37% of our revenue, then it went to 33% in 2013. And in 2014, what we said is we're headed where it'll be 25% to 28% of our revenue..."" The slow growth in the Americas region has significantly impacted total growth. Yet, the Top 50 as a percentage of revenue is trending downwards. As the Top 50's revenue becomes a smaller percentage of revenue, Teradata's Americas revenue growth will increase rapidly. This is because outside the Top 50, growth has been strong. The decline in the Top 50 has been consistent. This decline will continue as the company expands their customer base which will help growth. However, the Top 50's revenue decline is also starting to slow. On the Q2 conference call, Michael Koehler talked about the Top 50's better performance, ""the declines in the top 50, smaller."" The Top 50 has weighed on growth and its impact is starting to wane. Additionally, the Top 50's decline is becoming smaller which will help growth. The Americas region's revenue has suffered, but internationally revenue has been helping offset the decline.International GrowthThe IDC estimates the worldwide big data market will grow at a CAGR rate of 27% reaching $32 billion by 2017. The Americas region's revenue is suffering due to the Top 50 companies' lack luster spending. Yet, the slow growth in the Americas region is changing the geographical revenue split. From 2011-2013, the Americas region's revenue accounted for 61% of total revenue. In the first half of 2014, the Americas region's revenue has slipped slightly to 60%, but in Q2 the Americas region accounted for 55% of total revenue. Teradata's international reach has and will continue to offset the Americas region's slow growth. These markets are growing fast and should continue to remain strong for many years. The worldwide big data market is expected to grow 27%, but several international markets are expected to grow even faster. Research and Market estimates the European big data market will grow at a CAGR of 32.0% until 2016. The market is growing fast and Teradata has been able to take advantage of this growth.On the Q2 conference call, Michael Koehler talked about double digit growth from the EMEA region, ""The EMEA portion of international grew revenue 19% in constant currency"". The growth in EMEA revenue has been driven by solid growth in Western Europe. On the Q2 conference call, Michael Koehler talked about strength in Europe, ""Western Europe's been, really, our strongest over the last 1.5 years, 2.5 years and continues to go at a good rate."" The EMEA region grew 19% but international revenue grew slower. Teradata's international revenue grew 13.0% (without a 1% favorable currency impact) in Q2 and 5.2% in Q1, though international revenue has rebound significantly from 2013's 1.2% growth. Europe is helping boost international growth and should continue to help. Additionally, the international segment's growth should continue due to expected double digit growth in both Europe and Asia. In 2013, Teradata's international revenue growth slowed due to a decline in Japan. The decline in Japan led to a slow 2013 and has even impacted the first half of 2014. Yet, management believes Japan is stabilizing.On the Q2 conference call, Michael Koehler talked about revenue from Japan, ""Japan, we see stabilized. We actually had growth in constant currency in the first half and towards the end of last year."" Management is already seeing a return to growth in Asian markets. They have seen Japan stabilize and China appears ready to start spending in the second half. On the Q2 conference call, Michael Koehler talked about China, ""it's more cyclical, and we see great opportunities in the second half in China as we get out into 2015."" The big data movement is strong not just in the Americas but internationally. Europe is expected to grow faster than the worldwide market and Teradata is doing a good job growing in the European market. The Asia-Pacific region has been slow due to Japan being a major revenue contributor in Asia, but Japan is stabilizing. Additionally, China is expected to start spending and the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow faster than worldwide markets. The IDC estimates the APEJ big data technology and services market will grow at a CAGR of 34.1% reaching $2.38 billion by 2017. International revenue makes up nearly 40% of revenue and should continue to grow rapidly. This will help offset slow growth from the Americas region. However, management's recent acquisition should help in the quest to revive growth in the Americas region.The Rise Of Consulting ServicesProduct revenue has always been a major portion of total revenue. In 2011, product revenue represented 47.5% of total revenue, but has since dropped to 45.7% in 2013. Product revenue's decline is the result of slow product revenue growth, but also a rapid rise in service revenue. Product revenue grew 15.6% in 2012, but declined 5.2% in 2013. Yet, service revenue grew 10.3% in 2012 and grew 6.9% in 2013. In 2014, product revenue has rebounded, growing 3.8% while service revenue has continued its growth at 3.7%. Service revenue's consistent growth has made it a significant part of revenue. Although the growth in total service revenue has been consistent, consulting service revenue growth, which represented 30% of total revenue in Q2, has slowed. In 2012, consulting revenue grew 11.7% and 5.4% in 2013. However, consulting revenue has declined by 0.25% in 2014. The decline in consulting revenue has weighed on growth, but management believes consulting will have a solid second half due to their current backlog.On the Q2 conference call, Michael Koehler said, ""Consulting Services was flat in the first half, but backlog grew as expected, setting us up for a stronger second half."" The consulting business is an important part of revenue and looks to be setup to contribute to growth in the second half and even in 2015. On the Q2 conference call, Michael Koehler talked about service revenue strength, ""we do have some things going in the right direction like our consulting services business and our services business overall. And we are seeing a buildup of opportunities that are there in the fourth quarter and beyond."" Management expects consulting revenue to rebound nicely and their recent acquisition should aid in this recovery, especially in America. Management recently announced the acquisition of Think Big Analytics. Think Big Analytics is a big data consulting firm with 100 employees specializing in Hadoop, NoSQL databases, and open-source projects. Think Big Analytics' 100 employees will increase Teradata's consulting arm by only 2%, according to PC World. Yet, Think Big Analytics has the unique ability to quickly create project iterations in as little as 6 weeks. Think Big Analytics will help quickly create results for customers and Teradata. Consulting revenue is a significant part of total revenue and is poised to have a strong second half. With the addition of Think Big Analytics, Teradata's already strong consulting arm gets even stronger.Only A Few Percentage Points NeededTeradata's revenue growth has slowed to the low single digits. In Q2, revenue growth was less than 1%. The company's slow growth is emanating from their Top 50 customers. Revenue from the Top 50 has been declining over the last year and a half. This decline has weighed on revenue growth. Yet, the impact of the Top 50 is waning. Additionally, Teradata is experiencing rapid growth outside the Top 50 and internationally. In Q2, international revenue grew 9.9% while the Americas region's revenue declined. International revenue growth is being driven by strong demand in Europe. Europe's big data market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 32% until 2016. Teradata has been able to take advantage of this growth. International revenue is being driven by Europe but the Asia-Pacific region appears ready to contribute meaningfully to growth.In 2013, international revenue growth slowed to 1.2%. The slow growth was the result of weakness in the Japanese market. The weakness in Japan slowed growth, but the Japanese market has begun to stabilize. Management saw slight growth in late 2013 and the first half of 2014. The improvement in Japan combined with better expected revenue growth from China should help accelerate international growth. International revenue will continue to offset slow growth in the Americas region, but management's recent acquisition will aid in reviving growth in the Americas' consulting segment. Consulting revenue has been an important part of revenue. Yet, consulting revenue declined in the first half, but management expects a solid second half due to a strong consulting backlog. Additionally, management's acquisition of Think Big Analytics will aid in restarting consulting revenue growth. Think Big Analytics isn't a large company, but they have an unique ability to quickly create product iterations. Teradata has had a difficult 2014 but the second half of the year looks poised for a nice recovery. Despite slow revenue growth, Teradata is experiencing rapid growth in many markets. The combination of growth in international markets, waning influence of the Top 50, and solid expected services growth, will help Teradata accelerate revenue growth. The acceleration of revenue growth will improve investors sentiment which will reward shareholders."
2724595,23471,2014-12-02T11:31:05-05:00,"TDC is suitable for Enterprising Investors, but not Defensive Investors following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is undervalued at the present time.The market is implying 4.92% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is significantly less than the growth the company has seen in recent years.","Teradata Corporation (NYSE:TDC) presents an intriguing investment possibility for value investors, as the company has maintained fairly strong earnings growth over the last few years that may not be properly priced into the market price. Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that looking at the price cannot be the sole factor in investment decisions, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how Teradata Corporation fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.TDC data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - September 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryTeradata Corporation does not pay a dividend.Conclusion:Teradata fares quite well in the ModernGraham model, and is suitable for Enterprising Investors. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio, lack of dividends, and the high PB ratio, while the Enterprising Investor is only initially concerned by the lack of dividends. As a result, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to that valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.47 in 2010 to an estimated $2.43 for 2014. This is a fairly strong level of demonstrated growth which is well above the market's implied estimate for 4.92% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years. Here, the historical growth in EPSmg over the last five years is around 12.93% per year, so the market is expecting a very significant drop in earnings growth. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure, assuming that some slowdown will occur, but it may be unrealistic that the company would see such a significant slowdown in growth over the long term. Therefore, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value above the current price, indicating the company is significantly undervalued at the present time."
2244053,66103,2014-05-29T13:45:11-04:00,"Teradata has attractive valuation with low risk of permanent capital loss.The company has a moat surrounding its business due to high customer switching costs.There is no indication that Teradata's business is being disrupted by distributed technologies such as Hadoop or No-SQL.Teradata generates prodigious amount of free cash, which it is returning to shareholders via aggressive buybacks.Prominent value investor and insider buys indicate the stock is undervalued.","Teradata Corporation (NYSE:TDC) is an Ohio-based company, spun off from NCR Corp. in 2007, that has global operations focused on data warehousing and enterprise analytics. Teradata is the largest of the ""pure play"" big data vendors, coming only after IBM (NYSE:IBM) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) and ahead of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP). Its solutions include software, hardware and related consulting and services.Investment ThesisThe growth of ""big data"" -- especially transactional data -- would give the company a secular tailwind. Increasingly, a company's data warehouse represents a key strategic asset as it provides critical insight into its operations and its customers. Teradata's business has a ""moat"" as it is not easy for a customer using its solutions to switch to a competitor's offering, and 95% of its revenue comes from its relationships with existing customers. Additionally, as data grows in a company's data warehouse, the relationship tends to become stickier.TDC currently appears to be undervalued due to slower growth in the last two years. However, I expect the company to break out of the growth funk in the coming quarters as the economy recovers and businesses seek additional insight to drive growth. In fact, revenue growth of 7% in the latest quarter seems to support this. However, going forward I expect the company is likely to grow revenues in the high single digits, and not double digits as in the past.ValuationIts balance sheet is strong with low debt-to-capital ratio of less than 12%. The company in its recent quarter had $922 million in cash and a total debt of $270 million.The company trades at a P/E multiple of 18 (forward P/E is 12.5) and a P/S multiple of 2.5. Both these multiples are significantly below the median P/E and P/S multiples as shown in the chart below. The red and blue lines below represent median P/S and P/E justified price. TDC is currently trading below the median multiples of the past six years. The current PEG ratio of TDC is 1.1, which is quite decent for a company in this industry.The company is generating significant free cash flow, which is currently at $2.86 per share (TTM). One of my favorite valuation metric is the ""cash return."" We can calculate cash return by adding free cash flow (cash from operations minus capital expenditures) to net interest expense (interest expense minus interest income), and then dividing the sum by enterprise value (market cap plus long-term debt, minus cash). We add back interest expense to free cash flow so that capital structure doesn't impact cash return. Therefore, cash return = (free cash flow + net interest expense) / (enterprise value). Teradata's cash return in 2013 is an excellent 8%.While TDC does not pay a dividend, the company has been using some of the excess cash flow to reduce outstanding shares. The share count has dropped by almost 16 million shares since 2007, thus returning money to shareholders. The company continues to aggressively buy its own stock using its prodigious cash flow.Value Investor InterestJean-Marie Eveillard portfolio manager of the First Eagle Funds and a leading value investor has a large position of approximately 10 million shares in TDC and continues to add to his position. Eveillard's approach to asset management is defined by the conviction that absolute long-term performance is the best way to preserve capital, rather than attempting to compete against the short-term movements of the major indices, and rigorous application of bottom-up fundamental analysis intended to reduce risk. His strategy incorporates on-site research by actively visiting companies and talking to managers to gain rounded, first-hand knowledge of investment prospects. Eveillard buys securities whose intrinsic value and long-term potential outweighs market risk (sources: Gurufocus.com, Morningstar.com).Insider ActivityInsider activity is favorable with several directors buying shares recently. Teradata's CEO Michael Koehler, purchased 10,000 shares at $41.30 in February (close to the price level as now). This would indicate that insiders consider the shares to be good value at this level. One of the greatest investors of all time, Peter Lynch, was noted as saying that ""insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise."" Insiders are prevented from buying and selling their company stock within a six-month period; therefore, insiders buy stock when they feel the company will perform well over the long term. When a CEO puts up a significant amount of his own money into his company's stock, this is usually a strong indication that the stock is undervalued.ConclusionTeradata is transitioning from a high growth stock to a growth at a reasonable priced (GARP) stock, which has led to a sell off as momentum players abandon it. I believe after the churn in shareholder ownership subsides, the stock should trade in the $50s representing a 25% upside from here. Both S&P and Morningstar rate it as a four-star stock.The company has high free cash return and is aggressively returning cash to shareholders via stock buybacks. It also sports a return on equity of over 20%. I believe you can do a lot worse than compounding your invested capital at 20% per annum.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in TDC over the next 72 hours.

Although revenues grew 1% year-over-year to $676 million, earnings per share were down 5.7% to $0.66 (excluding one-time items) from the year-ago quarter. The company experienced increasing adoption of enterprise data analytics platforms, which has propelled strong quarterly sales for Unified Data Architecture, Aster and Big Data systems and services, said president and chief executive officer, Mike Koehler.Teradata also recorded the second-highest new data warehouse client wins for the second quarter and for the first half in its entire business history. Going forward, the company seems poised to capitalize on new customer wins and strengthening business relationships with large-size international vendors. In addition to this, Teradata will continue to benefit from ongoing geographical expansion, sales force improvement and growing database analytics markets worldwide.However, Teradata expects revenues to grow at the lower end of its full-year guidance, ranging from 3% to 7% on a year-on-year basis. Additionally, the company has been facing strong pricing pressure due to the sluggish spending environment in the United States and increasing competition from other data warehousing providers like EMC (EMC) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP).Here's why Teradata is poised to outperformTeradata stock has lost about 7.6% of its value since the beginning of 2014, but the data warehousing and analytics company still boasts a potential upside opportunity, citing growing market share and new product alignments. Over the past few years, the company has been fiercely trying to reclaim its leading position in the data analytics market. According to International Data Corporation, the enterprise Big Data solutions market is expected to grow from just $6 billion in 2011 to $32.4 billion in 2017. Teradata derives more than half of its revenue from high-end data warehousing business, and the growing demand for cloud computing and Big Data solutions and services should drive substantial revenue growth in the coming years.Office Depot has recently engaged Teradata for the expansion of enterprise data warehouse, or EDW, through integration with the latter's new Active EDW, which has capabilities to support increasing analytics needs across Office Depot's more than 2,000 stores and e-commerce sites. Furthermore, the company has been providing several innovative platforms to Office Depot for enabling better analytic insights into business performance amidst growing data volume. Travelzoo also has expanded its existing integrated marketing services relationship with Teradata, which would enable it to generate high-quality leads to support app-download marketing campaigns.However, Teradata has been facing strong competition from fellow data warehousing and analytics providers, in particular open-source competitors such as Hadoop. EMC and NetApp have also challenged Teradata's market position with their competing offerings and outsized financial capabilities. EMC's joint venture, Pivotol, launched several specialized cloud and data analytics systems and platforms this year, whereas NetApp continues to tap the rapidly growing cloud computing and Big Data solution markets. For its part, Teradata has unveiled Aster R to improve the performance of certain open-source analytics platforms, but the company needs much more to compete with larger rivals.This past month, Teradata has completed the acquisition of Hadapt and Revelytix, which could certainly extend its Big Data portfolio and enhance Teradata's Unified Data Architecture. Revelytix's data management tools in Hadoop and Hadapt's intense expertise in Big Data will enable Teradata to accelerate Big Data innovations in the future. Meanwhile, the company has joined hands with MongoDB to develop a JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON-based high-speed, bi-directional connector called QueryGrid, which would allow users to easily integrate data to support high-performance analytics and other innovative applications for mobile, e-commerce and social media.The bottom line Teradata has ample amount of cash to invest in innovate platforms, which would meet the demand for rapidly growing cloud computing and Big Data markets. The company is expected to announce new products at the Teradata 2014 Partners Conference in October this year. Meanwhile, the company continues to benefit from a high level of complexity, deep integration and substantial costs, which deter its customers from switching to other data warehousing companies. In the end, the company's stock look relatively attractive from a long-term perspective, citing Teradata's investment in Big Data technologies, including Teradata Aster and Hadoop."

        According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is fairly valued at the present time.
        The market is implying an 4.4% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, within a margin of safety relative to the rate the company has seen in recent years.","Teradata Corporation (NYSE:TDC) may intrigue many investors simply because it has dropped in price relative to the market over the last month, making it somewhat attractive based on its price alone. That said, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to determine a potential investment's merits. Here's an updated look at how Teradata Corporation fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.This model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.TDC data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests, or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 4/5Key DataBalance Sheet - March 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryTeradata does not pay a dividend.Teradata is much more attractive as an investment than some of its competitors. For example, a ModernGraham valuation of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) indicates the company is not suitable for either the Defensive Investor or the Enterprising Investor.Teradata Corporation is suitable for the Enterprising Investor but not the more conservative Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned by the low current ratio, lack of dividends, and the high PB ratio, while the Enterprising Investor is only concerned with the lack of dividends. Therefore, all Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding with the next stage of the analysis, which is a determination of an estimate of intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.71 in 2011 to an estimated $2.26 for 2015. This level of demonstrated growth is in line with the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 4.4% over the next 7-10 years.The company's recent earnings history shows an average annual growth in EPSmg of around 6.5%. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces such a rate to a more conservative figure, assuming some slowdown will occur, but still returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling within a margin of safety relative to the current price, indicating Teradata Corporation is fairly valued at the present time."

The liberal use of the phrases dilutes their true importance, but there are opportunities to be had in the emerging tech ""revolution.""The Internet of Things - IoT - will convert non-connected stuff into internet-enabled devices capable of collecting vast amounts of data. Look at the Nest Thermostats, which track and sends monthly energy information to owners or smart bands that track your workout and sleeping habits. These two consumer devices will generate huge amounts of data themselves, but will be infinitesimal compared to the data companies will produce. This data will need to be stored, analyzed, and available immediately for companies to truly utilize it. The IoT will produce the data, which companies like Teradata (NYSE:TDC) will store, analyze, and make immediately available for clients. The exponential growth in data creation will produce strong tailwinds for the big data analytics guys.This group includes TDC and competitors IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). This group provides clients ""data solutions,"" or more simply put, they store the data and convert it into actionable information.TDC Competitive AdvantagesTech Advantage: TDC has no legacy products to protect, while IBM and ORCL do. This allows TDC to be proactive in building out infrastructure to support the migration to the cloud, as opposed to competitors who, partially, have to defend ""old"" applications - relational databases, bare metal data centers. The tech advantage is noticeable, with Forrester ranking TDC as a market leader in big data Hadoop wave, noting few vendors can match their high-performance. Intellectual property seen in 660+ patents will serve to protect several of these advantages.Source: ndm.netCustomer Base: 85%+ of revenue is recurring due to high switching costs and customer satisfaction. These costs are due to the vast data TDC manages for its clients, while the high customer satisfaction can be seen in a consistently high net promoter score. TDC has a diverse customer base that includes Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Mizuho Financial Group (NYSE:MFG), Metro AG (MEO), and others across all industries. In total, TDC has over 850 clients from all over the world.Strong Returns: TDC consistently boasts an ROC of 50%+ and an ROE of 20%+.TDC Growth and Margins PictureTDC has two revenue segments - Products and Services.TDC operations are split into two segments - Americas and International.Q1 '14: Product sales grew in the mid-single digits, compared to no growth in 2013. Service growth declined to 4% from 7% in 2013. Product growth is projected to hold steady in the mid-teens in 2014, while Service sales are expected to improve in H2 '14.TDC signed several new clients in the Americas, but a few deals signed earlier than expected should soften Q2 growth. International sales came in lower than management expected - low-single digits - but TDC has a strong funnel of foreign clients lined up in Q2 (helping to offset soft Americas Q2).In the short term, total revenue growth is projected in the mid-single digits. Management attributes limitations on revenue growth to tight budgets regarding data management amongst large companies, thus reducing TDC's ability to up-sell current clients and add/steal new clients.The lower spending by large corporations impacts integrated data warehouse (IDW) sales, but demand from smaller clients regarding point solutions remains strong*.*IDW is a higher revenue offering, while point solutions are less expensive ""good enough"" solutions for clients.The tailwinds in the data storing and analyzing sector indicate stronger long-term growth. One concern is how quickly and to what extent will companies adopt the tools needed to fully utilize the new wave of data. All in all, TDC is positioned well to grow earnings in the low teens over the next 5 years.The CompetitionTDC's top two competitors are ORCL and IBM. Despite a slow year in 2013, TDC has grown at a faster rate since 2011. The table below shows 2011-2013 CAGR:While not a direct corollary, the growth makes arguing against a TDC tech advantage difficult. *It is also an attribute of a smaller growth base than ORCL, IBM.Gauging R&D success is closer to alchemy than true science, but TDC has a large advantage if you measure R&D by revenue gains divided by the past years R&D (I understand all the issues with this approach, but it is merely a method to loosely approximate R&D success).The flawed but telling Return on R&D figures further signals that TDC has the technology edge. So as ORCL and IBM can throw more money at R&D, the smaller and more agile of the companies is able to pivot and adapt faster.TDC has a more cash-laden balance sheet in terms of net cash. Its net cash per share is $2.69 compared against ORCL and IBM, who are at -$1.06 and -$20.07, respectively.ManagementTDC management has shown a commitment to shareholders through share buybacks, reducing the share count from 181.3M to 160.9M since 2007. This trend should continue, as TDC added an additional $300M to its repurchase program in 2013.CEO Michael Koehler and directors Nancy Cooper, David Kepler, and William Stavropoulos have been buying stock in the open market this year. This vote of confidence from management is very reassuring.Valuation:To frame the valuation process, let's look at past P/E figures for TDC, ORCL, and IBM.Over the past 8 years, TDC has grown earnings at 11.5%. Assuming an average earnings growth figure near 11.5% over the next 5 years, TDC should be trading at 21.4x earnings. This, in turn, puts TDC's intrinsic value at 48.58 (excluding further buybacks). Although, mid- to low-teens guidance for 2014 could justify the lower multiple.The crude approach above is not enough to reach a valuation. The next step is to examine the probability of certain earnings outcomes over the next 5 years.*Value calculated with DCF model using 10% discount rate for all outcomes and 3% long-term growth for all positive growth outcomes.The sum of the weighted values equals a current expected value of $52.52. This results in a 21% margin of safety.Conclusion:TDC operates in a growing industry with strong tailwinds, high switching costs, and strong recurring revenue streams. It rates highly in customer satisfaction, with indications of a technology advantage over competition. TDC has a diverse customer base, limiting exposure to any one industry downturn.I would strongly recommend TDC as a ""BUY"" with a long-term outlook.Risks/Concerns:Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Names such as Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS), Borders (bankrupt), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) to name a few have all been hurt to various degrees by the low-cost, hyper-competitive Amazon. I am not highlighting another retailer to be undercut by Amazon, but rather the data warehousing space and poster child Teradata (NYSE:TDC). While I am not predicting demise for the space, Hadoop has allowed companies such as Amazon to come out with competitive products at a fraction of the cost. Coincidentally, Teradata has struggled over the last few quarters, blaming shortfalls on the macro environment. Be forewarned, TDC may be feeling the initial adverse effects of Amazon Web Services (aka AWS) data warehousing product 'RedShift' that was unveiled only November 28, 2012.AWS + Hadoop = Formidable Competition on the HorizonInside the online retail giant is a $3.8 billion (2013 revenue estimate by Macquarie) Web Services business that specializes in outsourced computing power. (Note Amazon doesn't break out the group in detail therefore estimates all come from dissecting the ""Other"" category.) According to the head of Amazon Web Services Andrew Jassy -Initially AWS provided server capacity, storage and networking connectivity that allowed a business to quickly set up a website or application. Now firmly established as a category leader, AWS is trying to move up the value chain to offer higher margin services such as data warehousing and analytics. Amazon's 'Red Shift' is a data warehousing service that runs on cluster(s) of commodity servers by using Hadoop, an open source file system. In layman's terms, Hadoop allows an application's processing to be divided into smaller components and executed on cheap, commodity hardware. Hadoop is ideal for a data warehouse that needs to process massive amounts of data in short order. According to Amazon, RedShift can scale up to multiple petabytes and costs only 1/10th that of traditional data warehouses. While AWS primarily targets SMB it has a host of blue-chip clients such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Unilever (NYSE:UL), and Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI). There have not yet been accounts replacing Teradata with RedShift or other Hadoop appliances; however, it appears to be freezing the market as clients evaluate the solutions.AWS Focus Squarely on Expanding to the EnterpriseAt Amazon Web Services re:Invent Conference last year, the focus of the company was squarely on showing that it can be an enterprise vendor, not just a partner for SMB and startups. Amazon stressed its security and reliability of its systems in order to garner the confidence of enterprise CIOs. Recent reports also indicate that Amazon is aggressively hiring a large enterprise salesforce, poaching many salespeople from enterprise companies such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and EMC (EMC). Lookout Teradata, you are forewarned.TDC Not Seeing Big Deals But Splunk and Others AreTeradata's struggles started in Q2 of 2012 when growth decelerated from the 20%+ rate to 13% y/y before sliding further into the high single digits for both Q3 and Q4'12. Americas is seeing the biggest slowdown exacerbated by the lack of big deals while EMEA appears to be relatively unaffected. For the first half of 2012, America's revenue increased 22% y/y while in the second half revenue increased only 5%. Management warned that Americas will most likely decline in Q1 year over year. In Q3'12 management started to warn of a large transaction being deferred. The situation with large deals, identified as $10 million or more, has not changed with management repeatedly warning that large deals are unlikely to close for the first six months of 2013. Usually management provides a two point range for forward year revenue guidance initially; however, due to its caution it provided a four point range.Conversely, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) another Big Data, business intelligence company, albeit smaller than Teradata, pointed out that it is seeing an increased amount of large deals, in fact $1 million+ deals more than doubled year over year versus last year and they signed their largest deal in company history this past quarter- $20 million.Why Doesn't the Ramp in Sales Headcount Translate to Growth?Teradata should be seeing an acceleration in revenue as it spent the last two years ramping its headcount in sales. In the two-year period from 2008 through 2010, Teradata added 30 sales territories per annum. In 2011 and 2012 it accelerated the hiring and added 45 and 49 new sales territories, respectively. Given the company states that it takes on average two years to become productive then we should be seeing a pickup in revenue growth from the accelerated sales additions that are becoming productive in 2013 and 2014. In contrast, revenue growth is decelerating from mid-teens to twenty percent year over year to mid to high single digit for 2013 if 2H'13 growth picks up.Denial Isn't Just a River in EgyptTeradata management is adamant that Hadoop and other competitive products such as Hana from SAP (NYSE:SAP), Exadata from Oracle, Greenplum from EMC, and Hadoop products from AWS are not hurting its business. Yet Teradata continues to see revenue growth decelerate dramatically despite a big pickup in sales headcount growth and new products from recent acquisitions. While this note focuses on AWS RedShift, Hana and Exadata continue to show impressive growth with management not highlighting any of the issues that Teradata mentions. Teradata views Oracle and IBM (NYSE:IBM) as its main two competitors in the space. At its most recent analyst day, IBM raised its estimate for its data analytics business to $20 billion from $16 billion in 2015 from $10 billion in 2012.Teradata Bulls' Likely Rebuttal to HadoopTeradata management acquired the remainder of Aster Data Systems it didn't already own in March 2011 for a combined $259 million. Aster is now Teradata's answer to Hadoop that allows it to address unstructured data. Teradata packaged the solution as the Aster Hadoop appliance in October and has five wins as of its last conference call. The revenue impact of the product is de minimis at this time but bulls will argue Teradata has a product if/when Hadoop develops to scale.Valuation Not a Stretch but 2H'13 and 2014 Numbers at RiskAnalysts in typical fashion think Teradata management is being overly cautious and model a sharp 2H'13 upturn when big deals return. Q1 revenue is likely to be flattish year over year and possibly down while Q2 is modeled up mid single digits year over year on a slightly easier compare a year ago which is reasonable. Management has been cautious ad nauseam at the Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Conferences this quarter so investors seem prepared for a lackluster quarter. Although when Q1 quarterly previews from brokers come out I expect number cuts as revenue is trimmed. However, analysts are modeling an acceleration to mid-teens revenue growth for both Q3 and Q4. Besides easier compares in both quarters, it's unclear what will change to re-accelerate growth. Consensus '13 and '14 are too high probably on the order of 10% for EBITDA and EPS. When numbers come down for 2H'13 and 2014 as we approach mid year, I expect TDC stock to trade down to $50, 20% from current levels. At that price, stock will still trade at a healthy 16-17x 2013 P/E as the company will see growth return to mid to high single digits and stable margins. While expectations are very low for Q1, it seems that Q2 earnings could be the catalyst for downside when management needs to fess up if they are seeing the anticipated 2H recovery that is in numbers. At that point they will likely need to confess that 2H'13 numbers are too high and they still don't see large transactions returning. Longer term, if Amazon starts to win marquee accounts with RedShift and TDC is forced to reduce pricing to compete, look out below.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1529102,24279,2013-07-01T08:34:33-04:00,,"In the midst of a half year rip roaring rally, Wall Street took a wrecking ball to data warehousing and analytics company Teradata (NYSE:TDC). Shares peaked at $81 last September, only to be cut down to $48 in the last few days. Back in the Fall of 2102, Teradata warned analysts there would be significant headwinds from cutbacks in IT spending in the Americas, and the Americas constitutes 60% of the company's revenues. The company has disappointed investors for three quarters now.Belt tightening in the executive suites of Fortune 1000 companies continues to dog the information aggregator and facilitator. However, Teradata is not alone in this fiscal fog. The entire S&P 500 technology sector was up only 5% for the first half of 2013 in an overall market that increased nearly 15%. The best first half of a year since 1999. With earnings season a few weeks away, it's crunch time for the tech sector. Many enterprise technology companies (including Teradata), have been promising second half results since the New Year.The ranking general at Teradata is CEO Michael Koehler, and during the company's most recent conference call, he states that last quarter may be the end of his company's slide to the downside:There is flimsy scientific evidence as to how much growth can be expected from the ""Big Data"" sub-sector in Information Technology out to the end of the decade. Last year, Big Data was the flavor of the month with promises of 15% growth as an aggregate for the next five years from the majority of research firms. Some of the stocks in the sector made lightning-quick moves to the upside, and this includes Teradata which is considered to be one of the best, if not the best data warehousing company on the planet. Competitors IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) may have something to say about that, but there is little doubt that Teradata is a top notch organization.What most of these research companies didn't anticipate was a really lousy year. Many investors got their pockets picked when they bought in at the apex of enthusiasm for the sector last Fall. Traders with an insatiable appetite for momentum put Teradata on the Investor's Business Daily top 50 stock picks during that time. I don't believe that Teradata will get back to the lofty price levels of 2012 for at least a few years. However, that doesn't mean a patient investor can't find a decent entry point if indeed they want to invest in a company and sector that is clearly out of favor.Despite the bad year, one big thing I like about the company is that they've increased earnings per share at a healthy clip since they were spun off from NCR (NYSE:NCR) in 2007. That includes 2013. In 2012, Teradata made $2.44/share. This year, that number is projected to be between $3.05 and $3.20, the low end of guidance, but an increase just the same. The stock closed at $50.23 on Friday, so that equates to a P/E ratio of 16.3 for the year if indeed management hits its targets. Except for 2008 and 2009 when the market crashed, this gives us a historically low Price to Earnings for the company. However, this is with a six month extrapolation of the data.This is not a small entity. It resides in the S&P 500 with an almost 9 billion dollar market cap. Research and Development was a healthy $45 million for the quarter, so they are not standing still. Net cash flow was $243 million in Q1 versus $192 million the first quarter in 2012. Teradata is also flush with cash with $865 million on the balance sheet. During Q1, they also repurchased 1.6 million shares for $94 million. The organization has approximately $230 million of share repurchase authorization remaining.If we examine the consensus analyst estimates on Yahoo Finance, we get the something that is inline with company guidance when it relates to earnings per share: $3.01 for this year, and $3.41 for 2014. However, like with most securities, there is a wide discrepancy between the low and the high projections. In fact, for you Teradata bears, Cowen recently issued an underperform with a $45 price target for the company. Not everybody is in agreement that this is where to put your money, at least in the near term.Earnings growth has ground to a standstill this year with the average analyst calculation of just 6.3% for 2013. A far cry from the 18% annual average the company achieved since it went public. If we look out five more years, the sell side is projecting a 13.5% growth trajectory. We can make an assumption that's not happening until spending picks up for big ticket enterprises.The time-honored technique of buying laggards like Teradata may be a good investing option if you like to bottom fish. The current trend is buying dividend paying defensive securities, and with good reason. It was only four years ago we had an entire system overload and subsequent crash. Enough time has passed that we may have sector rotations into cyclical companies in the second half of 2013. It must be noted, specifically about this company that there was a decline in deal sizes, and number of deals in the last quarter.

970121,24714,2012-11-01T16:10:04-04:00,,"Teradata Corporation (NYSE:TDC) is a data analytics company that specializes in data warehousing and other big data operations. It offers investors a unique opportunity to invest specifically in big data as many of its top competitors like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP are conglomerates who are heavily invested in several other realms of systems and services. Shares are down around 6 percent today as the company missed earnings. In this article, I explain why this drop in stock price gives investors the perfect opportunity to pick up Teradata at a bargain.Earnings MissFollowing a short bear run and missed earnings, Teradata shares are down about 10 percent over the last five business days. The earnings miss resulted from Teradata's revenue expectations missing coupled with a lowered revenue guidance going forward. Analysts expected $667 million in revenue, while Teradata reported $647 million, for a 3 percent miss. Teradata reported that future revenue growth would be towards the low end of its 12 to 14 percent estimate. Earnings actually beat estimates with 69 cents per share (non-GAAP) with estimates guessing 67 cents per share. The company also said their future earnings growth would be towards the mid to high range of previous estimates.Even though earnings beat, it is not surprising that Teradata shares dropped 6 percent after this report. With growing companies like Teradata, making revenue estimates is much more important than earnings estimates as consistent misses in revenue growth can really hurt the company's overall size at it matures. However, the higher than expected earnings shows that Teradata can grow into a highly profitable company and investors can feel more confident about issues like scalability and long term sustainability as the company is demonstrating that it can be consistently profitable.Growth OpportunityTeradata is expected to finish 2012 with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.79. This number is expected to grow 15 percent to $3.21 in 2013. Analysts expect non-GAAP earnings to continue growing 15 percent per year over the next 5 years. GAAP earnings per share have typically been between 85 percent and 90 percent of non-GAAP earnings, with executive options compensation accounting for the difference.For revenue, analysts expect revenue to increase 12.6 percent from 2012 to 2013 to result in $3 billion in 2013 revenue. After the most recent guidance, this number will probably be adjusted down to just south of $3 billion. These are very solid revenue estimates considering that the company reported $1.7 billion in revenue in 2009.ValuationTeradata has a 1 year GAAP forward P/E ratio of 22.75, which is high compared to the market as a whole, but is quite low when compared to other mid-cap systems companies like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), who still struggle with profitability. I currently put a 1 year target price of $75 on the stock, which is 18.4 percent higher than its current price. After that, I would expect 10 to 12 percent growth per year.RecommendationI currently have a Buy recommendation on Teradata shares. The company's fundamentals look very sturdy for a systems company and it has a proven track record of profitability, with $1.4 billion in retained earnings and a company history that dates back to 1979. I believe big data is just as attractive of an industry as cloud computing and global payments, and Teradata should have no problem meeting its future growth projections.For those looking for mergers and acquisitions arbitrage, I do not believe that Teradata is an acquisition candidate for any company at the moment. It was spun off of NCR in 2007 and many of the companies large enough to acquire it, like Oracle and SAP, have their own suites of data warehouse software. Despite being much smaller than its competitors, I believe Teradata has what it takes to compete with these big companies.Disclosure: I am long IBM.

But, for long-term holders and short-term renters, the market is offering up opportunities in fast growth plays tied to big data, including Teradata (NYSE:TDC).Teradata shares have taken investors on volatility rise this month. When the company beat The Street's estimates by 7% on May 3rd, shares jumped 10% higher. However, J P Morgan's (NYSE:JPM) mea culpa and Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) European worries drove the stock down 18.5% to its low on May 18th. Since then, a move back up to just shy of $70 has investors wondering ""what next?""Data management grows up.Recently, I've written a fair amount about big data. Enterprises are embracing solutions aimed at breaking down legacy data silos. Where data was once locked away in vaults by business unit, C-level executives are finally shifting their focus to a more comprehensive, unified and accessible plan.Two years ago, reducing server footprints was all about saving money. Today, the goal has become much more comprehensive. Sure, enterprises are still attracted to solutions allowing them reduce spending on equipment, maintenance and utilities, but, they also want security, unification, access and most importantly, sales-boosting data mining tools. These C-level goals have invigorated a trend toward real time analytics, such as those provided by Teradata and bolstered by the company's acquisition of Aster last year.Sales reflect strengthening demand.Customer's are voting in favor of Teradata's approach, driving Q1 sales up 21% to $613 million. The sales came in at the second highest level in the company's history, as product revenue increased 31%. Sales upside provided leverage too, with operating margins improving to 23.9% from 22.7% last year.Sales were strong across the globe, with America's up 26% to $388 million. Despite European struggles, the EMEA region saw 9% sales growth to $136 million, and Asia Pacific and Japan grew 20% to $89 million. Sales should continue higher as the company bulks up its sales team, with an expected 35-45 new territories coming online this year.The company's acquisition of Aprimo, a cloud-based marketing management company, and eCircle, a digital marketing firm, strengthen the company's marketing offering in both the United States and Europe. This is critical to the company's plan, given Teradata estimates up to 45% of all big data implementation and as many as 70% of its customer accounts are tied to marketing initiatives.So, while big data technology companies are likely to volatile through summer, those interested in companies with faster than market growth should consider using waves to build up exposure. Particularly, if you agree IT spending will continue to embrace offsite data solutions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in (TDC) over the next 72 hours."
289834,24279,2011-08-25T12:10:45-04:00,,"""Big Data"" is an expression that's crept into the lexicon of IT professionals across the corporate landscape. Teradata (NYSE:TDC) is the top of the line in big data warehousing and data extraction with its software, hardware, consulting and support services. However, it is not alone in the field. Primary competitors IBM, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP, and, to a lesser extent Informatica (NASDAQ:INFA), are no slouches and are putting up a fight. Teradata is trying to outflank the market with recent acquisitions of Aprimo and Aster Data. This allows the company to integrate offerings in the cloud and gives it an upper hand, but in no way gives it a license to run the table.If you aren't familiar with the concept of big data, it is a play on the burgeoning growth of the new services Internet 2.0 has presented us. According to the most recent Teradata 10-K: ""...examples include web logs, radio-frequency identification, sensor and social network data, Internet text and search indexing, call detail records, genomics, astronomy, biological research and military surveillance information, medical records, photography archives, video archives, and large scale eCommerce data."". The whole shebang. Just about anything we do with Internet applications.We have ignition in the volcanic rise in all of this information, and, Teradata CEO Michael Koehler brings it all to a head in the Q1 conference call: ""Looking to the future, the explosion of data will continue. IDC says this explosive growth means that by 2020, our digital universe will be 44x as big as it was in 2009. Whether data grows by 44x or 22x by 2020, it's a lot of data corporations will need to manage and extract value from."" Going a step further, in Teradata's Q2 conference call, CEO Koehler explains: ""All of this big and complex data presents an opportunity and a threat to corporations. The one's who are able to manage the data and extract new insights and precision from it will have an advantage over their competitors. The corporations that don't manage this data explosion and extract value from it, will be stuck with the cost of the data and will be at a competitive disadvantage.""A probable scenario in active data warehousing was given in the August 4th, 2011 S&P Report on Teradata by analyst Thomas Smith: ""...a business's call center could produce raw data on call attributes (e.g., number of calls, duration, agent, customer, dropped calls, results), which could be a starting point for mapping and analyzing overall interactions with customers, including Internet communications, which could then become the basis for a plan to improve customer satisfaction.""Another example is given by Teradata CIO Stephen Brobst on May 4th, 2011, in an article by Arima Salah-Ahmed in Daily News Egypt: ""If I introduce a new product or service, I can get immediate feedback that would've taken months through focus groups and research. I can readjust my pricing and market position immediately with that data."".Teradata is attempting to get control of the information asylum by going for the jugular. As mentioned earlier, with the acquisitions of Aster Data and Aprimo, the company now throws its weight around in the explosive arena of cloud computing. Aster Data was purchased for unstructured big data and Aprimo was absorbed for integrated marketing management and applications.Mr. Koehler talks about the Aprimo move in the Q1 conference call: ""Moving on to Aprimo. The acquisition has made Teradata a leader now in integrated marketing management...But in addition, Aprimo serves as a foundation to build out more applications and to leverage their Software as a Service and Cloud capabilities more broadly, longer term.....we have already merged our existing Teradata applications into Aprimo.""It should be noted that according to Chris Kanaracus from the IDG News Service in a posting titled Teradata Buys Aster Data, Boosts 'Big Data' Wares: ""Aster Data's platform is also available for cloud-based deployments on Amazon Web Services, AppNexus, Dell's Data Cloud, and Terremark..."".Although there is the potential for good, solid growth for Teradata from new customers in the largest 3,000 global companies, there is also the aspect of additional business from its existing client base. As the most recent 10-K points out: ""Data warehouses are typically built one project at a time. For example, an initial data warehouse may start with a single subject area, which forms the foundation of data that is available to be leveraged for the next project, and so on. Therefore, a customer with a large order in one quarter is likely to generate additional revenue for subsequent periods.""Head honcho Koehler discusses the future going forward for the company in terms of sales and earnings growth in the Q2 conference call: ""...as we look out longer-term, we're looking at a minimum of 10% of revenue growth over the longer term. And over the longer term, we're looking at earnings per share growth of 1.5x at revenue growth. I think shorter term, we have an opportunity like we're seeing right now for higher revenue growth, but maybe not as robust of an EPS growth relative to the revenue growth that we're making.""That near-term revenue growth he is referring to is also discussed in the same transcript: ""Turning to guidance, we are increasing our revenue growth guidance for 2011, from a range of 14% - 16% to a range of 18% - 20%. And we're increasing EPS from a range of $2.13 to $2.23 to a range of $2.20 to $2.28.""Nothing gets an investor's blood boiling like a miss on heightened expectations, and, Teradata has been handcuffed since the CEO reported its numbers on August 4, falling from a price of $54 to its current valuation of roughly $45. The sinkhole the stock has fallen into can be attributed to the overall market sell-off, but it was also trading at a fairly lofty valuation.Consensus earnings estimates on Yahoo Finance give Teradata an EPS of $2.26 for the current year which gave it a P/E Ratio of 25 at $56/share. Not too expensive, but for a company that is slated to grow at a five year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 13.88%, you can find a better entry point. Many investors can't contain their enthusiasm about the prospects of the markets going forward, like they are going to make beaucoup bucks by putting their money on any security in the technology space. I don't believe that to be true. This is no ordinary recession we are experiencing. As of this writing, Teradata's P/E Ratio is 20. A very tempting valuation, but still too expensive for me as earnings contract on a global scale.I don't mean to be heavy handed with a company like Teradata. It's a quality organization that was formed in 1979 and spun out of NCR in 2007. R&D is 7.6% of 2010 revenue, which is a plus. It operates on a global basis with a footprint in 60 countries. It also has a broad customer base with the top ten customers accounting for only 16% of revenue. If you get the opportunity to read any of the conference call transcripts, you'll be impressed by the heavy hitters it does business with. For an example, eight of the top ten retailers utilize Teradata, companies like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). I'd like a quality equity like Teradata for my portfolio, but until the global debt situation is resolved, I'll just watch and wait. Disclosure:  Am short the market with inverse ETFs."

Earnings per share (EPS), including stock-based compensation of 3 cents, grew 29.5% from 44 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Based on the strong quarterly result, Teradata raised its fiscal 2011 revenue and EPS outlook.Operating PerformanceGross profit was $328.0 million, up 22.4% year over year from $268.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Gross margin decreased 50 basis points (bps) to 56.5% in the quarter. The decrease in gross margin was due to lower services margins, arising from the higher mix of low margin Consulting Services revenue compared to higher margin maintenance services revenue.Operating expenses were $181.0 million, up 11.7% year over year from $162.0 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A), which increased 31.0% year over year to $165.0 million. Research and development expense increased 13.9% year over year to $41.0 million.The year-over-year increase in SG&A was primarily driven by higher expenses related to Aprimo and Aster Data, higher selling expense from the increased number of sales territories, higher variable expense and foreign currency impact.Despite higher operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income increased 27.4% year over year to $135.0 million in the quarter. Operating margin came in at 23.2%, up 60 bps year over year based on strong revenue growth in the quarter.Net Income was $98.3 million, up 31.6% from $74.7 million in the prior-year quarter.RevenueRevenue increased 23.6% year over year to $581.0 million. This was driven by a year-over-year growth of 21.0% in Product revenue (software and hardware) to $269.0 million and a 26.0% year-over-year growth in Services revenue.The strong year over year growth was driven by strong performances from the financial services and retail industries.Region-wise, Teradata achieved strong growth from the Americas in the quarter. Revenue increased 21.0% year over year to $339.0 million on a reported basis. The Americas contributed 58.3% of the total revenue in the quarter.Teradata witnessed 34.0% year-over-year growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region to $145.0 million, while Asia-Pacific/Japan revenue increased 20.0% year over year to $97.0 million.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowTeradata exited the quarter with $682.0 million in cash versus $778.0 million in the previous quarter. As of June 30, 2011, Teradata had long-term debt of $295.0 million.During the quarter, Teradata generated $179.0 million of cash from operating activities versus $106.0 million in the previous quarter. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $33 million versus $27 million in the previous quarter. This resulted in a free cash flow of $146 million versus $79 million in the previous quarter.Teradata repurchased 720,000 shares in the second quarter for approximately $38.0 million. The company has approximately $155.0 million remaining under its existing share buy back authorization.OutlookFor fiscal 2011, Teradata expects year-over-year revenue growth of 18.0% to 20.0% (up from the previous guidance of 14.0% to 16.0%). EPS is expected in the range of $2.20 to $2.28 (up from previous guidance of $2.13 to $2.23). The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $2.08 per share for fiscal 2011 at the time the company reported results.Teradata expects to witness higher selling expense for 2011, as the company continues to add more sales territories to expand its customer base. Teradata expects to double the number of sales territories added in 2011. The company now expects to add 60 sales territories versus prior estimate of 30.However, this added investment in the new territories will generate incremental operating expenses in the second half of 2011 and in 2012. This will have a negative impact on operating margin for this period. However, Teradata expects these additional investments will drive revenue and operating income for 2013 and beyond.For 2011, Teradata expects R&D expenses in the range of $165 million to $170 million including Aprimo and Aster Data.RecommendationWe maintain our Neutral recommendation on the stock over the long term (6-12 months) due to a weak revenue mix and increasing competition from major players such as Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) and Netezza Corp. (NZ).Currently, Teradata has a Zacks #3 Rank, which implies a Hold rating on a short-term basis (1-3 months)."
285457,24287,2011-08-07T14:40:36-04:00,,"It’s kind of ironic that Teradata (NYSE:TDC), which actually invented the big data, data warehouse is being grilled about its big data strategy. Hold that thought.The crux of the first day of Teradata’s Third Party Influencers  conference, a kind of Vegas summer camp for selected partners and  analysts, was about how Teradata is expanding its footprint as it  competes as an independent in an avenue of giants.As part of the tour, we were given a nostalgic glimpse at a 1998 – 99  vintage slide showing Teradata’s definition of an Enterprise Data  Warehouse; it’s the definition of the classic galactic enterprise  storehouse that never really became the single repository of all things  analytic over the years. But for organizations like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) or eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), it  provides the core research for the big analytic problems that such  businesses require.Teradata has recalibrated this vision to an “Integrated Data  Warehouse” which is a more realistic notion in a world that has become  so interconnected to the point where it’s ridiculous to think that you  can centralize wisdom in a single place. Instead, the idea is to think  beyond single purpose data warehouses, not necessarily to consolidate  every departmental data mart in sight, but to put together places where  you might have several intersecting fonts of wisdom. For instance, in a  consumer products company, you might want to stage a warehouse that  covers customer and product data, because there are going to be  synergies when you start doing analytics to segment your customer base,  because product preferences may provide some richness to the  demographics.In the past year, Teradata has done a couple of acquisitions that could reshape its course going forward. Acquisition of Aprimo, an integrated marketing campaign management provider that competes with IBM’s recently-acquired Unica  places Teradata into the applications space, although – like IBM – it  still positions itself as not being in the applications business. Sure,  Aprimo provides Teradata with a chance to sell an additional product to  consumer product companies, but today’s session provided little insight  as to the long-term synergies that it will provide to the mother ship.As to the applications issue, well, that’s a natural issue that any  vendor in the middle or data tiers has got to confront because: (1) the  enterprise software market continues to consolidate, and vendors can’t  stand still when it comes to growing their footprint and (2) the natural  direction to embed more logic in the middle or data tiers will thrust  otherwise agnostic software vendors into the apps space whether they  consciously intend to get there or not.In Teradata’s case, it’s been gradually heading this direction for  years with its vertical industry data models, so at some point, as the  company strives to aim higher up the value chain, it has to add more  logic that could be construed as applications. Same thing for IBM with  its vertical industry oriented middleware frameworks.But ironically what drew the spotlight was the plan for Teradata and its other acquisition, Aster Data. Ironic because it wasn’t even on the official program today — Tasso Argyros,  who co-founded Aster Data, won’t be speaking until tomorrow. It  prompted questions from the peanut gallery as to how Teradata was going  to get into the big data market, which prompted Teradata to throw out  the challenge to those of us cynical questioners as to how would we  define big data. “I hate [the term] big data,” stated Randy Lea, VP of  product marketing and management, as the term has become one of those  buzzwords that means all things to all people.The irony of course is that Teradata’s heritage was having a platform  that could house bigger data warehouses; it essentially invented the  original Big Data market 30 years ago, when Big Data was measured in  megabytes. But there is a different vibe to big data today, not only in  volume, but the variety of forms – and some say, the velocity at which  it comes in. We’d also add, it also has a different vibe when it comes  to governance, whether that means archiving or dealing with privacy and  confidentiality over data that was theoretically made public in a social  network, but not necessarily in the context of a marketing database  maintained by a third party.Although parts of the briefing veered into non-disclosure territory,  we still left the day with confirmation of our existing belief that in  the long run there will be convergence of traditional SQL data warehouse  platforms with the new Advanced SQL technologies associated with  MapReduce and other capabilities that allow them to process ridiculous  amounts of data, fast. We also believe that there will not only be  convergence between SQL and MapReduce (already happening and public with many vendors), but also with the principles of NoSQL  data stores. From that standpoint, it was quite interesting that almost  every third question from the audience was in some way related to, what  will Teradata do with Aster Data?Disclosure: No positionsDisclaimer: Author is an analyst with Ovum; the opinion stated does not necessarily reflect that of Ovum."
243311,22829,2010-12-22T16:38:40-05:00,,"By Brenon DalyAnnouncing its first major acquisition since it was spun off into a stand-alone company more than three years ago, Teradata (NYSE:TDC) said it will pay $525 million in cash for Aprimo. The deal marks a significant bet by the data-warehousing giant on the application market. Specifically, Aprimo brings a marketing automation offering to run on top of Teradata’s existing business analytics offering. Aprimo products will continue to be marketed and sold under the company’s name once the transaction closes, which is expected in the first quarter.According to a conference call discussing the acquisition, Aprimo is expected to generate about $80m in annual sales. (We understand that roughly $60m of that is recurring revenue.) That means Teradata is paying a healthy 6.5 times revenue for Aprimo. That’s slightly ahead of the valuation that IBM (NYSE:IBM) paid in its big marketing automation play four months ago. Big Blue handed over $523 million in cash for Unica, valuing the publicly traded company at 4.8 times trailing revenue.Part of Aprimo’s premium could likely be attributed to the fact that it was steadily moving its business from a license model to a subscription basis. In fact, Aprimo’s SaaS offering accounted for a majority of its revenue. IBM’s move was important in the Aprimo process, as we gather that Teradata and Aprimo started talking only after Big Blue had closed its acquisition.Disclosure: No position"

phase of its public life as a $5.2 billion company with shares changing
hands at just under $29. Is there an investment idea in this stock now
that you can invest directly in it?
Background   Teradata
is a well-known vendor of data warehouse software. They have been
around long enough and are big enough to have built a list of marquee
clients in a number of different industries. In all, they have over 850
customers worldwide. Below is a very abbreviated list of the industries
and customers served by Teradata but it will give you an idea of the
reach the company has among large enterprises.Customers  Financial Services: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), ABN Amro (ABN), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Retail: Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP), Sears (SHLD), Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), Bed, Bath and Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) Miscellaneous:
Fed Ex (NYSE:FDX), Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH), UNUM (UNN), Nationwide Insurance, Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Harrah's (HET),
British Airways (BIARY.PK), Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL), Travelocity, 3M (NYSE:MMM), Ford (NYSE:F), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO),
Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). Teradata also sells to government entities such as the US Air Force, Naval Air Command, States of New Jersey and Missouri, etc.The data warehouse market  The
company feels that the enterprise data warehouse industry is a $19
billion market growing at a 6.3% CAGR. Teradata's stated desire is to
grow 30% faster than the market. This seems to be doable as long as the
company avoids any major stumbles. The company has an
approximately 9% share of the total market among the Global 3000. They
share this market with IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, HP and others. Gartner
characterizes Teradata as the industry leader in both software and
hardware.Financials  Teradata's revenue has been
steadily increasing over the last few years but growth in earnings per
share seems to be slowing a bit lately. It is expected that 2007 EPS
will be flat at about $1.09 with revenues coming in at around $1.6
billion. At its current stock price, it has a PE around 27, not cheap
but not as richly valued as VMWare, for example. The company
sees an incremental increase in expenses as the result of going public
but expects that this will be a short-term impact. As part of NCR,
Teradata was taxed at a lower rate. That benefit will not be available
as a stand-alone company.Challenges   Teradata is
positioned like the Cadillac of data warehouse systems. Their pitch is
that they have the most efficient, scalable, flexible, highest
performance system available. As competitors reach for market
share by reducing prices, however, Teradata can find themselves in the
position of losing business, even at established customers. For
example, Wal-Mart recently awarded a contract to Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ)
despite being a long-time customer of Teradata. As prices are
driven down the market expands to include smaller companies that
previously could not afford a true enterprise data warehouse solution.
This is a lesson that SAP is learning -- you need to be able to compete
in the mid-size market as well as in the top tier. Teradata is
working to differentiate themselves from competitors by focusing on
what they call ""operational analytics"" -- the ability to make decisions
on the most up-to-date data. As business moves faster and faster, this
concept is becoming more popular. Teradata's market leadership will
depend on the company being able to leverage this strategy with more
customers. As competitors have added more features to their
product offerings, they have been catching up to Teradata. The company
needs to ensure they can provide functionality that both sets it apart
from competitors and extends the platform. One way to do that is by
partnering with complementary vendors. Teradata has partnered with SAS
to enable the popular SAS analytics software to run on Teradata's
databases.Conclusion Teradata is a pure play in the
data warehouse sector. They are the technology leaders but have tough
competitors who are making inroads into their market. These competitors
are also applying pricing pressure. Freed from NCR, the company can
pursue a more focused and flexible approach to managing their business.
They might even become a take-over candidate. Nevertheless, I think it
is too early to invest in Teradata until we can see whether their
strategy is yielding the growth that management promises. Full Disclosure: author owns no shares of TDC"
187320,20568,2010-02-08T12:54:41-05:00,,"Teradata Corporation (NYSE:TDC) announced that it would release its 2009 fourth quarter results before the market opens on Feb 11, 2010.   During the third quarter earnings release, management had raised its outlook for fiscal 2009 due to continued focus on operational execution, which is driving growth. Accordingly, earnings per share were expected to be in the $1.34 – $1.38 range, up from its previous outlook of $1.22 –$1.28. As a result, 1 out of the 9 analysts covering the stock raised estimates for the full year 2009 in the last 30 days.  With respect to earnings surprises, Teradata recorded an average earnings surprise of 42.12% in the last reported four quarters (meaning that it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 42.12% during this period).  However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for $1.37 cents per share in earnings for full-year 2009 with a 0.73% potential negative downside. This is a 6.16% decline from the $1.46 per share in earnings reported in fiscal 2008. In our view this is due to the company’s weak revenue guidance.   Revenues for the full year are expected to be down 1% to 3% on constant currency basis. Although the company expects SG&A expenses to be down, selling expense, research and development expenses, as well as amortization of capitalized software costs are expected to be higher in the fourth quarter of 2009.  We remain optimistic on Teradata, as it is well positioned to benefit from the growing database analytics market. However we would ask investors to remain on the sidelines until the stock delivers improved traction from its sales force expansion strategy.  The company’s third quarter results beat the Zacks Consensus estimate. Teradata expects long-term revenue growth of 7% to 9%. We expect improved traction from Teradata’s sales force expansion strategy, which should drive top-line growth in 2010 and beyond.  Teradata added over 40 new sales territories in 2008 and remains on track to add a total of 60 new sales territories by the end of fiscal 2009, thereby totaling 445 territories in 2009. The company expects to add another 30 teams in 2010. Revenue could accelerate, given the expansion of its sales territories and the building of its distribution channels and we opine Teradata to be a 2010 growth story.  Moreover, Teradata’s balance sheet remains strong with no debt. The company is sitting on a cash (cash plus short-term investments) balance of $704 million and generates impressive cash flow from operations. Year-to date, cash flow from operations was $364 million and free cash flow $303 million.  The data warehousing market is mature and has been dominated by large payers such as Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL), Netezza Corp. (NZ), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Sybase Inc. (NASDAQ:SY) and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP).  Teradata is up against increasing competition from much larger players in the data warehousing industry, which is leading to market share erosion. With a greater number of competitive products in the market, we expect pricing pressure to continue, thereby limiting margin expansion.  While we expect the data warehousing market to benefit from increased enterprise spending in the next year or two, increased consolidation among larger players in the data warehousing industry is eating into Teradata’s market share (currently ranks fourth in terms of data warehousing market share according to IDC research).  We have a Neutral recommendation on Teradata, indicating that it would perform in line with the market. Our price target of $30.00, 20.4X 2010 EPS, represents a slight discount to the industry but a premium to the S&P 500."
203438,20568,2010-05-06T13:26:24-04:00,,"Before the opening bell today, Teradata Corp. (NYSE:TDC) reported fiscal first-quarter  earnings of 39 cents per share, up 50% from 26 cents per share reported  in the year-ago quarter. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  of 31 cents per share.   Earnings benefited from improved operational performance, a lower tax  rate, a higher gross margin and increased revenue. As a result, net  margin improved to 15.6% from 12.3% in the year-ago quarter.   The company includes $5 million, or 2 cents per share of stock-based  compensation expense in its results.   Total revenue increased 17% to $429 million from the year-ago quarter,  driven by an increase in product revenue (software and hardware) of  27.0% year over year to $200 million. Revenue includes a 5% positive  impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Services revenue also  rose 9% year over year to $229 million in the quarter, driven by  strength in both the Consulting services and Maintenance services  businesses.   On a regional basis, Teradata witnessed strong growth from the Americas,  which grew 23% year over year in the quarter, or 21% when adjusted for  currency. Moreover, the company witnessed strong results in  international markets as well. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA)  region increased by 9%, or 3% when adjusted for currency. The Asia  Pacific region also increased by 9% year over year, but fell 1% when  adjusted for currency.  Operating Performance   Operating income increased 43.3% year over year to $86 million due to  higher revenue and slight improvement in the gross margin, which more  than offset higher SG&A expense and higher R&D expenses. As a  result, operating margin improved to 20% in the quarter from 16.3% in  the year-ago quarter.   Gross margin of 55% increased from 54.5% in the year-ago period due to  higher services gross margin and a more favorable product mix. Services  gross margin increased to 47.2% from 46.2% in the year-ago quarter.  However, product gross margin declined to 64% from 65.6% in the year-ago  period.   The effective income tax rate in the quarter was 22%, compared to a 25%  in the prior-year period.  Balance Sheet & Cash Flow   Teradata’s balance sheet remains strong with no debt. The company exited  the quarter with $712 million in cash versus $661 million cash in the  previous quarter.   During the quarter, Teradata generated $138 million of cash from  operating activities versus $91 million of cash generated in the  previous quarter. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $21 million  versus $27 million in the previous quarter. This resulted in a free cash  flow of $117 million versus $64 million in the previous quarter. In  addition, Teradata used approximately $70 million of cash to repurchase  approximately 2.4 million shares.  2010 Guidance Raised   As a result of a record first quarter revenue and earnings, Teradata  raised its guidance for the full year 2010, previously given out during  the fourth quarter 2009 conference call.   For fiscal 2010, Teradata expects revenue to increase 8% to 10% from  fiscal 2009 level, including negligible benefit from currency  translation. This compares to the company’s previous guidance of a  revenue growth of 7% to 9%, including 1% to 2% benefit from currency  translation.   Despite an increase in the company’s tax rate for the full-year to 25.5%  to 26.5% range, the company expects higher EPS. Earnings per share are  now expected to be in the $1.60 - $1.70 range. This is up from the  company’s previous guidance range of $1.54 to $1.64 per share."

1844962,54342,2013-11-17T05:12:10-05:00,,"The revolution surrounding Big Data is considered to be the next big thing in the technology industry. So the recent slump in the share prices of Teradata Corporation (NYSE:TDC) comes as an utter surprise for many. The stock has been trading close to its 52-week low of $44.07 and the growth in revenue has not been tremendous. This has primarily been due to the under performance outside the US (refer table below).Table 1: Segment Wise Revenue Performance Of TeradataNet income was worse as it saw a marginal decrease this quarter as compared to the previous year. It steeply reduced from $104 million to $98 million; a drop of 5.77%. Operating margin that used to be around 60% in the heydays of the company has gone down drastically to around 55% in the past couple of years. Some are yet hopeful that the stock will rally to its 52-week high that was close to $70 while others claim that this is, indeed, a glitch in the performance of the company. Fortunately for those who have immense faith in the company for years have observed the company deliver profits on a consistent basis. Sound financial fundamentals accompanied with an operating niche that has a positive outlook has kept many optimistic as yet.Interpreting The RSI ScoreThe past one year saw investors selling the shares of Teradata in abundance making it an oversold stock in the bourse. While the expectations of shareholders may not have been met there is little justification to the selling spree that the stock has witnessed. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) score is another indicator that suggests that the oversold position may just be over for the company. Last Monday the shares of Teradata accumulated an RSI score of 29.8 compared to the S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) score of 60.5. Any score below 30 suggests that the share is oversold and it is very likely that the trend may reverse unless there are other factors that may hamper such an event.The Growth Drivers For TeradataThe ever changing revolutionary IT landscape has been the biggest threat to the profitability and per of Teradata. Every day new solutions arise that seem to surpass the older versions. In spite of tremendous pressure, Teradata has been able to maintain its status quo in the data warehousing and analytics industry as a leading player. While on a standalone basis it may be a force to reckon with, the company has understood the significance of strategic partnerships in a bid to bolster its position not only in the US but also in the international markets where the performance has been far from satisfactory. Even though there have been no significant offerings in its outlook for 2013, its collaborations with other entities in forming new solutions could herald a new dawn in the future. Its recent association with the Belgium based ADAM software is expected to capture the data analytics segment in marketing sector. There are great expectations from the OEM agreement between Dot Hill Systems and Teradata is all set to improve the capabilities of the latter as Dot Hill Systems has proven to be a reliable manufacturer of systems that are compatible with the solutions offered by Teradata.Along with forging strategic alliances, the focal point for Teradata in recent times has been to target the conglomerate of government organizations. The scalability and the services offered by the data warehousing giant should match the essential requirements of these organizations considering the obvious fact that the volume of data these organizations need to maintain is substantial. Recently, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) acknowledged the sincere efforts of Teradata in rendering support to not-for-profit organizations and other government bodies and this may just work in favor of Teradata when it comes to obtaining newer contracts in the future. The uphill task to target large organizations should increase the dependency of these behemoths on Teradata and this in turn would ensure a steady revenue stream for the company.On the darker side, the company is yet to tap full potential of the markets of Asia, Middle East and Africa and it should look forward to establish its stature in those markets to spawn its global image. It is quite possible that the markets in the US and Europe will saturate soon and the developing nations may be the only avenue for substantial growth.A Detour In The MakingTeradata is possibly entering a phase in the bourse where the plunge is expected to come to a halt. The RSI score, steady performance, positive industry outlook and the recent partnerships should be a reason sufficient enough to indicate positive signals to the investors and restore parity to the share price.Figure: Movement in share price of Teradata in the past one yearThe share should touch the $55 mark from its current level (as on 15/11/2013) of $45.59 in the short term. Whether it will manage to breach the $70 mark or not, this will depend entirely on its performance in the markets of Asia, Middle East and Africa. For Teradata, these are markets that have witnessed intense competition of late and unless the company proactively seeks to tap these markets, there would not be much alteration in the income statement.Slow, Steady but SureThere is little evidence that indicates that Teradata would disappoint its esteemed investors. As the price revolves around the 52-week bottom, there is a clear indication that it is undervalued. Investors should look forward to grasp this opportunity without delay and hold on for the future. An earnings amiss in the subsequent quarters may delay the up-move but further drift downwards is unlikely. Such incidents should not dent the confidence of the shareholders as the company holds tremendous potential in the future. It is a slow and steady game but the ones holding their nerves should look to reap the rewards on long term basis.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Analysts at EurEx Consulting.

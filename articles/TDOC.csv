4385400,105003,2020-11-05T14:13:08-05:00,Teladoc Health is rapidly growing revenue and operates in a growing sector of the economy.Combining with Livongo Health gives the company access to a larger addressable market.Teladoc is trading around 25x projected 2020 sales.This article seeks to quantify the growth assumptions baked into the current share price.,"This article is the third in my 'quantitative valuation' series in which I explore valuations of high-growth technology companies. My first article on this topic was about Slack (WORK); that article contains an overview of my way of thinking quantitatively about companies that are growing quickly but are not profitable. As a brief refresher, my model relies on five key estimates: Total Addressable Market (TAM), the share of the total market that the company can reasonably hope to capture, the company's net margin once it has reached scale, the PE multiple the market will be willing to assign to the company once it has reached its peak market share, and the annual rate at which the company will compound revenue growth until it reaches peak market share. The goal is to estimate what the company's market cap will be by the time it stops growing and how long it will take the company to reach that point. The final result will be an estimated annual rate of return an investor can expect to receive if they invest in the company. In this article, I will be applying the model to Teladoc Health (TDOC).TDOC describes itself as:(Source: Company 10-K)The company has recently completed a merger with Livongo Health (LVGO), and the combined company will be the largest player in the virtual healthcare space, with a strong data analytics offering and a large network of multi-specialty physicians.I am keeping the business overview section brief, as the goal of this article is to explore valuation scenarios rather than provide a deep dive on the inner-workings of the company. I will assume the reader has at least a basic understanding of how TDOC conducts its business. There are many other articles here on SA that go into a lot more detail about TDOC's business structure; I would encourage those looking for a deeper dive on the company's operations to check them out.A quick overview of TDOC's recent financial performance, based on reported Q3 results: the company is on track to bring in about $1 billion in revenue for 2020, an increase of nearly 100% compared to 2019. The company's gross margins are north of 60%, though the company's net margins are negative. TDOC generated positive cash flow from operations in 2019 and is on track to do so again in 2020. The company's balance sheet has net $0 debt, with ~$1 billion in cash being offset by ~$1 billion in debt, as of the end of Q3. At the time I was putting this article together, TDOC had a market cap of $30 billion.A valuation model is only as good as the estimates it uses, so I want to talk about each one at a high level before going into the valuation scenarios:TAMTAM is always a bit tricky to estimate, especially the further out into the future you go. For these valuation exercises, I generally accept a company's own estimate for their TAM, but I take it with a grain of salt when considering conservative scenarios. I understand that a company has an incentive to inflate their TAM, but it is also true that many of these companies operate in growing industries and industry growth is not fully baked into my model. TAM rarely ends up being the constraining factor in a valuation anyway; if the TAM I use in my model underestimates the true TAM, then the revenue growth rate and time to reach peak market share end up constraining the model instead. TDOC uses $121 billion as their estimated addressable market, post Livongo merger.Market ShareMarket share is the most subjective estimate I use in my model; if you disagree with the ranges I use I am more than happy to hear a counterargument. That being said, I am unwilling to estimate that any company can capture more than 50% of a total market on a long-term basis. Despite consolidation in the tech industry, it is rare to find unassailable monopolies and new players are entering the market all the time to compete with existing successful companies. Even a company like Google, which controls over 90% of search traffic, owns only about 30% of the online ad market from which it derives the majority of its revenue. I'm not saying there can't be exceptions, but 50% is my default maximum. I am going to start lower at 40% for TDOC; I perceive that some parts of their offering can be replicated by competitors (such as video conferencing with doctors).Net MarginOne of the usual knocks against high-growth tech stocks it that they ""don't make money."" Net margins are often negative as the company invests heavily into growth, and it is true that some companies will fail and never made it to profitability. On the other hand, the most compelling appeal of high growth tech stocks is their ability to scale with minimal capital investment. The cost to add new users to the TDOC platform is minimal; at certain milestones more support staff might need to be hired and more cloud storage need to be purchased, but these costs are infinitesimal compared to the additional revenue each new customer brings in. Once a company like TDOC can cover their (relatively) fixed SG&A costs, revenue from each additional customer will be mostly profit and will beef up the overall net margin. Net margins of successful tech companies at scale (Microsoft, Facebook, Google, etc.) range from 20-35%, and I expect that TDOC can reach similar levels.Price to Earnings MultipleA company's price to earnings ratio is driven by investor sentiment and general market conditions, but I operate under the assumption that companies that are growing and have predictable earnings will earn a higher PE ratio than those that have stopped growing and have irregular earnings. In these valuation scenarios I assume that the company has reached its peak market share when the multiple is applied, meaning that growth has slowed to match the general pace of the market. Companies with a subscription model and recurring revenue like TDOC will have steady earnings. Thus despite assuming that growth has stopped, I assume the steadiness of the earnings will warrant a PE of at least 15.Revenue Growth RateIn these valuation models I used a compound annual growth rate for revenue to help make the math a little bit easier. I subscribe to the general principal that it is easier for a company to grow revenue when it is smaller and that revenue growth slows as the company becomes larger. For companies with network effects this isn't always a linear progression, but all companies face slowing growth as they get close to their maximum market share. I use a averaged compound annual growth rate in the modeling for each year, but in reality revenue growth rates are more likely to look something like 100% in year one, 80% in year two, 70% in year 3, etc., down to maybe 5 or 10% in the last few years before reaching peak market share. So, when I use a CAGR of revenue of 40% below, I'm not saying I expect TDOC to grow revenue exactly 40% each year, but rather that the average annual growth rate will be 40%. For some reference points, Google has averaged a 20% CAGR of revenue over the last ten years, Amazon has done 28%, Facebook has done a whopping 49%, and Netflix has done 26%.Beginning with an optimistic scenario, consider the implications if TDOC is eventually able to capture 40% of the estimated $121 billion addressable market, reaches a net margin of 33%, receives a terminal PE ratio of 20 from the market, and is able to grow revenues at a compound annual rate of 50% until it reaches its peak market share. For comparison, this would mean that TDOC surpasses the earning power of Microsoft (which has the highest net margin of any tech company above a $250 billion market cap) and matches Facebook's phenomenal trailing 10-year revenue growth rate. In this scenario, we can expect TDOC to achieve a market cap just above $300 billion in about 10 years, for an annual return of 26%:(Source: Author's Spreadsheet)A more moderate scenario would be to assume a lower market share of 25%, a net margin of 25%, a terminal PE ratio of 15, and an only slightly more moderated 40% CAGR of revenue. In this scenario, TDOC reaches a final market cap around $100 billion over the next 10 years, for an annual return on investment of 14%:(Source: Author's Spreadsheet)Finally, let's use a more cautious set of assumptions and say that the total addressable market is a smaller $100 billion, TDOC only captures 20% of this smaller market, the company reaches a net margin of 20%, the terminal PE ratio is 15, and revenue ""only"" averages 25% compounded annually. In this scenario we get a more modest $60 billion market cap and it takes TDOC 14 years to get there, for an average return of only 5%:(Source: Author's Spreadsheet)As I explore growth companies for this series, I continue to be surprised and impressed at how well the market is able to price them. The current valuation for TDOC seems reasonable and acceptable, assuming that the company can continue to grow for an extended period of time. More conservative estimates suggest TDOC will underperform over the next 5-10 years, but optimistic assumptions (that are still grounded in reality) result in an expected compound growth rate of 15-20% on an investment today. As usual, I would invite readers to use their own quantitative estimates and share the resulting outcome, especially if there is an area where you strongly disagree with any of the assumptions I have made."
4384760,22148,2020-11-04T04:15:03-05:00,Teladoc Health is unlikely to repeat the virtual visit levels of Q2/Q3 next year.The new entity has a market value of ~$30 billion after Teladoc alone was only worth a few billion to start 2019.The stock trades at a very expensive multiple of 15x combined '21 sales estimates.,"The main issue with Teladoc Health (TDOC) is that the virus crisis won't last forever. The telehealth concept will only garner more traction going forward, but the company will face tough comps next year. My investment thesis remains bearish on Teladoc Health as the merger with Livongo Health (LVGO) closes with the stock up nearly 150% in the last year.Image Source: Livongo Health websiteA big key with the recent addition of InTouch Health and the future addition of Livongo Health is for investors to not get caught up on reported growth. What ultimately matters for value creation is organic growth. Unfortunately these days, corporations don't report pro forma results to provide a clearer picture of organic growth.For Q3, Teladoc Health reported impressive revenue growth of 109%. The organic growth rate were still impressive, but the growth rate was down at 90%.The virtual health provider did an excellent job of maintaining telehealth visits at an elevated level in a period where visit volumes normally dry up. Though, a lot of questions exist on whether these gains are sustainable. Without a vaccine, patients were still reluctant during Q3 to enter medical facilities for routine care, especially high-risk vulnerable patients.In addition, areas of high growth, such as mental health services, aren't as likely to see the level of demand next year as during a period where the world constantly faces pandemic fears. So, while the market was caught up on substantial growth this year, Teladoc Health had to pay a massive premium to acquire Livongo Health.As a reminder, the deal involved Teladoc Health paying 0.592 shares plus $11.33 per share in cash for each share of Livongo Health. The deal had an original enterprise value of $18.5 billion.Livongo Health had 117.6 million diluted shares outstanding at the time of the merger. The deal conversion involves issuing 69.6 million Teladoc shares and paying Livongo Health shareholders $1.33 billion in cash.The deal adds ~$13.9 billion to the market cap of Teladoc Health. The deal value is down substantially from the original merger, when the stock price was nearly $250 whereas the current price is below $200.The combined merger has 150 million shares outstanding, for a valuation of $30 billion at a $200 stock price. With the $1.33 billion cash payment, the balance sheet is no longer impressive.Ultimately, the investment story is about organic growth. Analysts have Teladoc Health and Livongo Health generating the following revenues estimates somewhat updated after the big Q3 beats for both companies last week.Data by YChartsAccounting for the merger forecast for $500 million in revenue synergies by 2025 and $100 million following the second year after the merger close (2022), the combined entity revenue targets are as follows:Again, Teladoc Health has an analyst forecast of only reaching 2022 revenues of $2.5 billion, yet the stock already trades with a market valuation of $30 billion. Currently, the stock trades at a market value of 15x 2021 revenue targets even including a $50 million boost from revenue synergies.My biggest issue is the tough comps for the business in 2021. One only needs to look at the Twitter (TWTR) dip following weak Q3 daily users to see the issue Teladoc Health could face with tough comps next year.This year, Teladoc Health has seen the following growth rates in quarterly visits:In the past, peak virtual visits occurred during Q4 each year, but Teladoc Health is only predicting a minor bump from the elevated Q2/Q3 visit levels a month into the quarter. While a substantial number of visits in the last few quarters are now permanent virtual patients, the market is valuing the stock based on substantial growth in the next year when the inevitable pull forward issue will hit visit numbers.As an example, under a normal market scenario, Teladoc Health would've been happy with 50% visit growth in Q3 of 2020 and 2021. Instead of 206% visit growth last quarter, the company would've seen the 2019 visit total of 928K jump to only 2.1 million visits next year in a normal situation. The big question remains as to whether Teladoc Health can top the 2.8 million virtual visits next Q3 due to the tough comps where visits aren't likely repeated next year under a scenario where a vaccine exists.And yes, Teladoc is paid mostly by member access fees and not visit fees, but the stock will trade off the trend in visits. Livongo Health is paid based on virtual chronic management membership fees. Again, some of the virtual care benefits could wane next year without COVID-19 in full force with lockdowns.The key investor takeaway is that the combination of Teladoc Health and Livongo Health could very well be in the future of virtual care with the combination of virtual doctor visits and chronic care management, but investors are paying aggressively for a stock with demand pulled forward in 2020. Without a repeat of these massive 100%+ growth rates in 2021, the stock isn't going to hold $200. Investors should wait for a further pullback in Teladoc Health before making a long-term investment."
4383868,105619,2020-11-01T15:38:59-05:00,"We believe shares are significantly undervalued and the market is underestimating the accretion from Livongo.Q3 results were strong, Teladoc beat EPS and revenue estimates for the quarter, and management guided FY results up - a positive revision.Long-term investors can use current market volatility to obtain an attractive entry point into the market leader in telemedicine - a disruptive business model.","We initiated coverage of Teladoc (TDOC) earlier this year in March and wrote our full case which you can read here. Our thesis is simple: TDOC is poised to be a major beneficiary of the growth in Telehealth services, which solve two major challenges facing U.S. healthcare: rising costs and inaccessibility. Acceleration of adoption of Telehealth presents significant scope for Teladoc to capitalize on this trend, as the company offers the largest, complete, end-to-end solution in a marketplace where scale is critical in determining success.On 5 August 2020, TDOC and Livongo (LVGO) announced they would be merging. LVGO provides a consumer digital health platform for people living with a chronic condition using smart connected devices, personalized digital guidance, and access to health coaching. Conditions include diabetes, weight management, hypertension.Source: Livongo company websiteLVGO operates in the large and growing chronic disease market, as more than half of the US population has one or more chronic conditions and an additional ~4K Americans are diagnosed with diabetes each day. LVGO’s rapid growth profile is attractive, and unique in Healthcare IT with our model calling for an 85% revenue CAGR over the next three years as the company increases its member base, and we expect operating income profitability in 2021. Big growth prospects, and it is easy to see why LVGO is complementary to TDOC. The pair creates an unmatched care proposition which covers delivery, access and experience. Some points on LVGO:Specifics of the deal include: Each LVGO share will be exchanged for 0.592 TDOC plus $11.33 for each LVGO share and that TDOC shareholders will own 58% of the combined company. Here's the exciting part:When the deal was announced, the combined entity was expected to have FY2020 revenue of $1.3bn and EBITDA of $120m vs. TDOC’s FY 2020 then-estimated revenue $975.9m and EBITDA $80.2m. Last night, management guided for FY 2020 revenue of $1.01bn, a decent positive revision.LVGO carries $550m in convertible debt and $218m cash, while FY 2020 revenue is expected to be $330m and expected EBITDA of -$3.7m. Combined entity is expected to have $650m in cash and to be more profitable than the sum of the parts. According to management, the revenue growth rate is expected to increase +230bps over the sum, and to add 930bps to TDOC alone. There's a 27% overlap in TDOC and LVGO customer base with ample opportunity to leverage TDOC's network (+70 million lives) to push LVGO products and integrations with their telemedicine platform. We modelled out this accretion over the next 5 years:Source: Author's calculationsIn their latest results (reported on 28 October 2020), we learned that TDOC's network of providers delivered over 2.8 million virtual visits in the third quarter, more than triple the number of visits provided in the same period last year. U.S. paid membership increased to 51.5 million members during the third quarter, an increase of 47% versus the third quarter of last year.Visits for conditions including hypertension, back pain, anxiety and depression represented over 50% of TDOC’s general medical visit volume, up from 33% a year-ago. Their comprehensive portfolio of services enables them to meet the increasing consumer demand for virtual care. New registrations increased more than 80% compared to the third quarter of 2019.Demand for Dermatology and Behavioral Health services continues to significantly outpace overall volume growth. In the B2B channel, visits in these specialties grew over 500% compared to the prior year. Demand for mental health care in particular continues to build through the B2B channel and their Direct-to-Consumer brand BetterHelp. Utilization of mental health services has continued to grow in each successive month of the year which is very encouraging given the high repeat usage profile of the service.The company continues to push internationally – management announced a new partnership with Telefonica (TEF), one of the largest telecom providers in Europe and Latin America, including over 14 million customers in Spain. As part of this partnership, Telefonica will distribute TDOC’s virtual care offering on a D2C and B2B basis to individuals and employers across Spain – this sets the stage for similar deals moving forward.We ran a 2-stage DCF model and found Teladoc trades at a ~13% discount to fair value using the following assumptions:Expected revenue growth of 30% p.a. over the next 10 years. Terminal growth rate of 2.0% - above the current 10-year yield which is depressed given extraordinary market conditions.We capitalize R&D expenses into an asset which will deliver future economic benefits. The asset is amortized over an assumed useful life of 3 years using the straight-line method. We capitalize operating leases and we explicitly value stock-based compensation options.We value cash and marketable securities at book value. Our terminal Beta of 0.9 reflects Teladoc maintaining its market dominance as underlying operational leverage contributes to solid profitability.We actually think the above assumptions are conservative given the likelihood the LVGO deal puts TDOC on a growth path closer to 40% and long-term operating margins settle nearer 25% vs. our assumed 20%. Sensitivity analysis of our DCF highlights the potential upside (shaded blue) if the market appreciates this:There’s a lot to look forward to with TDOC, the merger with LVGO is likely to be highly accretive to growth and solidifies the business as the clear leader in Telemedicine – deal closes in Q4. The market appears to be underestimating the potential of the combined TDOC-LVGO company and the growth prospects of telemedicine in general. Long-term investors can use recent market volatility to pick up shares at what we view as attractive levels."
4383358,104985,2020-10-30T15:53:35-04:00,Teladoc posted 109% year-on-year revenue growth in Q3 and raised FY guidance to >$1bn.Results were fairly strong across the board - led by behavioural health.The Livongo merger depressed the share price and both companies must target userbase growth - but their synergies are very strong.The company believes its long-term TAM >$120bn and that doesn't sound unrealistic. I think revenues could reach $6bn by FY25.This all means the share price ought to grow and this could be a good time to open a position as the market reacted to strong earnings by dropping the stock price by 4%.,"Telehealth platform provider Teladoc (TDOC) reported its Q3 earnings yesterday, with revenues up by 109% year-on-year to $289m, paid members up 47% to 51.5m, and visit fee only access use up 15% to 21.8m people.The company also raised its FY20 revenue guidance from $980-995m to $1,005-1,015m and forecast adjusted EBITDA of $97-100m, but it wasn't enough to satisfy the market that has punished the stock today - Teladoc's share price has dropped by 10% to $195.In many ways that isn't surprising. Teladoc's growth over the past year has been explosive - its shares have gained in value by 203% - but the company still has a high price to sales ratio of 28x, based on FY19 data (17.5x forward P/S) and trades on its potential rather than its current performance.It seems that for the market, outperformance is not enough, given the benchmark for future performance has been set so high, but I am still backing the company to grow its share price further. Analysts' consensus target price for the stock is $245.I was surprised (and slightly alarmed) when Teladoc announced its decision to merge with consumer digital health platform (for management of chronic diseases e.g. diabetes, hypertension) provider Livongo (LVGO), in a deal which will see Teladoc pay ~$18.5bn: $11.30 plus 0.592x of a share in exchange for each Livongo share.Both companies are probably the outstanding operators in their fields, and in that sense, the deal makes sense, creating a digital health powerhouse that can dominate an important and rapidly growing industry in a similar fashion to how the GAFA tech giants dominate all things online - bar healthcare.Like Teladoc, however, Livongo trades primarily on its future promise - its price to sales ratio is 81x - so whilst the merger doubles the opportunity, it also doubles the risk, in my view. What if consumers do not take to managing their health online? What if the tech giants attempt to move into the space? What if there is a high-profile data breach?The theoretical market opportunity is so large, however - Teladoc management view the total addressable market (""TAM"") in the US alone to be worth >$121bn, and this is supported by independent research - that, when taken with the 2 companies' current competitive and first-mover advantage, I would consider Teladoc to be a strong buy and long-term hold opportunity.My own DCF analysis (based on analysts and management's own projections) suggests a fair value price that is in line with analysts' target price of ~$250, but I would actually set the FVP bar a little higher than this since my DCF is based only on revenues earned until 2025.I think Teladoc is following a longer-term business development plan, and that the most explosive growth may occur after 2025. This ought to become clearer over time, hence I will stick with my target price of >$400 that I set in my last post on Teladoc, except that I would push the timeframe back from 18-24 months to around 36-48 months before this target price is reached.Teladoc has been one of the very few companies which have seen a rise in business as a result of the pandemic. As CEO Jason Gorevic put it in his opening remarks on the company's Q320 earnings call:In Q3, Teladoc's network of providers - the company hosts 6 consumer-facing brands on its platform - Teladoc, Advance Medical, Best Doctors, BetterHelp HealthiestYou, and a new acquisition, InTouch - acquired for $600m in January this year - delivered more than 2.8m visits - 300% more than in Q319.Gorevic was keen to highlight that visit volumes also increased sequentially (albeit narrowly - there were 2.76m visits in Q220) - suggesting that platform activity was picking up irrespective of the more severe pandemic conditions in Q1 and Q2 - and despite seasonality, with Q3 usually viewed as a less productive quarter. One of the (few) bearish arguments against the company is that despite the obvious promise of telemedicine, users were not yet completely sold and per-member-per-month usage figures were lower than the company would wish.The CEO highlighted a rise in non-infectious disease related activity, with more than 50% of visits focused on hypertension, back pain, anxiety, and depression - which together represent more than 50% of the company's visit volumes. Behavioural health services and dermatology were the fastest growing business segments, with a 500% year-on-year rise, with counselling platform BetterHelp driving particularly strong growth.I think it's important the company does not become pigeon-holed as a mental health specialist, as this might impact the growth of its medical health segment, however, the InTouch acquisition ought to stimulate growth in this area - nearly 3m consultations have been completed by Teladoc's client clinicians on the combined InTouch/Teladoc platform this year, Gorevic reported, on top of the 7.6m member visits provided by Teladoc's own network of clinicians. Additionally, Teladoc has established a partnership with Johns Hopkins, the academic medical centre, which will provide 24/7 virtual care to its patients using Teladoc's platform. If nothing else, the partnership will serve as very useful R&D for the company.Meanwhile, Livongo drove 126% year-on-year growth in Q3, recording revenues of $106m. The holistic health platform also grew its client base by 71%, to 1,402, and its Livongo for Diabetes segment now has >442k members - up by 113% year-on-year.Both Teladoc and Livongo posted net losses for the quarter - -$35.9m and -$20.7m respectively, but I don't think this needs to be a concern for investors since the combined company is focused on exponential growth in user numbers and the implementation of new and more comprehensive services, rather than driving profits.Teladoc is an acquisitive company, spending ~$2bn to date on M&A, and I would be surprised if the company does not make many more purchases of small-to-medium telehealth or digital health-focused companies in order to provide the broadest possible range of services - think of it as like Netflix adding more and more programmes to its watch list!In its Livongo merger presentation, Teladoc uses an interesting phrase, ""lead the market and set the pace"", to describe its ambitions. Again, this reminds me of the kind of monopolistic strategy used by the tech giants e.g. Facebook's size and scale allowing it to rapidly mimic whatever new services or products its competitors come up with, or Google controlling online search, and by extension, online advertising.The ability to set the telehealth/digital health agenda by dominating the market is clearly a key component of management's business strategy. That said, the merger offers practical benefits too, like a forecast $500m in run-rate revenue synergies by 2025, and $60m by 2022.Teladoc's $121bn target market. Source: Livongo merger presentation.Teladoc will look to employ the full range of data capture techniques to learn as much as it can about its patients/clients and try to make sure all of their specific needs are catered for within its platform. This might sound a little creepy, but the pay-off is that patients will be provided with unique insights into the state of their health, which can be a good thing. The number of add-on services the company could provide, with access to that information is almost limitless.Again, think of it as Fitbit/Apple Health on steroids - in fact, I can see multiple synergies between wearable device providers and Teladoc. Cardiac monitoring, blood sugar levels, weight, exercise taken, and diet all spring to mind, and the ability to dispense advice across channels like instant messaging and video calling ought to provide a strong sense of patient empowerment.As mentioned in my intro, the scale of the potential future demand for telemedicine and digital health management is frightening. According to Forrester, 1bn virtual care visits will be carried out in the US alone in 2020, and according to McKinsey, Teladoc can save the US $250bn in healthcare expenses by virtualizing services.Teladoc, who currently cover 70m US lives with its solutions and will receive ~10m visits in 2020, is clearly still a long way away from associating itself with those kinds of numbers, but that will be the endgame for management and its board, which as I mentioned in my last article, appears to be influential, counting US Senator and healthcare investor William H Frist, Washington health benefits and policy advisor Helen Darling and Michael Goldstein, the retired Chairman and CEO of Toys R Us, amongst its members.Teladoc range of service provision. Source: Livongo merger presentation.As mentioned, I think Teladoc will be on the lookout for any company that looks either like a potential competitor or to be developing a product that it can bolt-on to its existing platform and will try to acquire them, helping it to grow inorganically and maintain control of the market. This won't just happen in the US, either - the company is already in 175 countries and has attracted 1.3m visits from overseas locations in the first 9 months of 2020.The beauty of the company's strategy is that domestically and globally, nearly everybody is familiar with modern platform technology, notifications, bundling online services etc. and so, if Teladoc can find a way to make the journey from technology to health as seamless as possible, it ought to scale very, very rapidly over a 10-year timeframe.I do have a few concerns about the company in relation to the above. Making the leap from technology to health is something that has never really been done before, and as many people have pointed out, a doctor cannot use their touch and feel virtually (yet) or provide the physical reassurance that patients often want. Could that be a reason why there was a gap in the market for Teladoc to exploit in the first place? Why haven't we seen a Facebook Health, or Google Health, project really take off?When it comes to the everyday doctor's surgery, this looks like a hard setting to recreate virtually, and it is notable that it is primarily the mental health side of Teladoc's business that has been successful to date.Teladoc's acquisition-led strategy will potentially see it take on more and debt, and although the company currently has $1.2bn of near-term cash, debt could pile up, investors could be tapped for further funds, or Teladoc could become so bloated by acquisitions that its true valuation becomes an issue, and analysts, followed by the market, may start to back away from the stock.Witness the likes of Big Pharma firms such as AbbVie (ABBV) (my note here) or Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) (my note here), between them, they market and sell 4 of the world's 10 best-selling medical treatments, but the share price, anchored to a huge debt pile and uncertainty as to whether management has overstretched itself, stubbornly refuses to move.At present, I don't think Teladoc will mind which parts of its business are growing because management will believe that transitioning from physical to virtual will take time, and that will actually play into the company's hands because management will also believe the transformative products and services that will move complex medical matters routinely online will emerge in the next few years and will fit seamlessly into the company's business model.If I felt that Teladoc could not in some way enhance the way modern medicine is practiced, then I would not feel bullish about the stock. But I think in the long run, it can have a positive effect on everything from electronic health records, to patient wellness, drug distribution, meds adherence, diagnostics, and preventive medicine. And Teladoc is a clear front-runner in this market currently that has shown its ambition via the Livongo merger.The hardest challenge the company faces is building its user numbers and generating revenues in the short-to-medium term, in my view, but with a provider/client base that includes giants like UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) and CVS (NYSE:CVS), Jefferson Partners Healthcare, Blue Shield of California, hundreds of hospitals and health systems, large numbers of institutional clients e.g. insurance and finance firms, plus Medicare and Medicaid coverage in place, these figures ought to grow.Some analysts have set a $5bn revenue goal for the company for FY25, but I believe Teladoc can beat the industry's forecast 38% CAGR slightly and post ~$6bn by 2025, which gives me a FVP of $280, using DCF analysis and a WACC of 7%. As mentioned, however, given the current premium of share price to revenues, I think the stock price can target $400 long term.The picture is unlikely to be so clear because of the acquisitions I believe Teladoc will make, but I still see the company as more tech giant than Big Pharma, so that ought to mean the share price keeps growing and doesn't become suffocated by uncertainty or flat user growth."
4378825,39011,2020-10-13T09:29:41-04:00,"TDOC and LVGO have produced very impressive growth as separate entities.Together, that growth should accelerate as profitability should see improvements from synergies.I see TDOC as a buy.","Image sourceTelehealth provider Teladoc (TDOC) has a terrific model that it is executing at scale. The move towards more telehealth visits and fewer in-person visits was probably inevitable given the former's convenience factor, but of course, COVID-19 conditions have accelerated this move. Teladoc was, therefore, in the right place at the right time, and the chart below shows the result.Shares have spent more than three months consolidating prior gains in a channel between $180 and $250, following a failed breakout attempt at $253 during the summer. Shares tried earlier this month to retake the $230 level and so far, have pulled back very slightly from there. However, I think the company's acquisition of Livongo (LVGO), and what I see as an unstoppable move towards more telehealth visits in the future will see the stock higher over time.Indeed, software stocks in general, as you can see in the middle panel, have vastly outperformed the S&P 500 this year, while Teladoc has outperformed its peer group by 100%. In other words, you've got a company in a great sector that is outperforming the outperformers. It is important to note this sort of thing does not guarantee future outperformance, but Teladoc is a clear winner.Growth is something Teladoc has never struggled for. The company has done a great job of attracting and retaining clients organically, but has also spent rather freely on acquiring new customers through acquisitions.Source: Investor presentationThe reason I like Teladoc for the long term is because it offers a massive convenience advantage over a doctor in an office, and in some cases, may be cheaper to both the insurance company and the patient. Cost savings aren't really part of my bull thesis; I think Teladoc's growth story is more predicated upon convenience than cost savings, but it is something to consider.This year has seen a massive spike in telehealth visits, which obviously makes logical sense given the conditions the world has endured. That spike has come back down to earth some since doctor's offices began reopening after initial closures, but this is exactly the sort of catalyst Teladoc and others in the space needed to show consumers their value proposition in terms of convenience.My thought is that 2020 has proven to be a situation where some consumers would have tried Teladoc out of necessity, and subsequently seen how convenient it is, making them much more likely to use the service in the future. In other words, as horrendous as this virus has been and continues to be, it has done wonders for the telehealth industry in terms of accelerating growth.I'm not suggesting that physical offices will cease to exist, because I simply don't believe that is reasonable. What I am suggesting is that telehealth can take care of routine sick visits, chronic care, and others, which are high volume types of care.Teladoc is acquiring Livongo because the former wants to scale more quickly, and because Livongo fills holes in Teladoc's offerings that should prove quite valuable over time.Source: Investor presentationThe combined entity will be the global leader in telehealth across a variety of disciplines, and will see massive synergies over the next handful of years. This is the sort of merger that is quite attractive, at least to me, because it combines two companies with complementary product offerings, both of which are producing very high growth rates, and with synergies that are meaningful. In my view, the merger should accelerate the growth Teladoc was already going to have anyway, and while mergers tend to be expensive, in this case, it appears to me that this is a very attractive tie-up.Indeed, Livongo is producing eye-popping growth metrics in its own right, similar to Teladoc.Source: Investor presentationImportantly, it retains 94% of its customers, which is part of the reason why I think telehealth companies in general are benefiting from 2020's conditions; people can see the value in the platform and are likely to stick with it, at least for certain types of visits.Source: Investor presentationLivongo fills gaps in Teladoc's models and vice versa, creating what should be a powerhouse telehealth giant with a hugely attractive catalog of services, and the ability to scale quite rapidly should the demand arise. The beautiful thing about delivering software as your primary revenue generator is that it is quite easy to scale. Doctors will almost certainly find value in the convenience as well as the fact that they can take huge numbers of calls each day from their homes, rather than paying for office space and office staff. In other words, the merger makes sense for Teladoc and Livongo, but the model itself is attractive to all parties, in my view.All of this should lead to some pretty amazing growth potential for Teladoc.Source: Investor presentationRevenue growth is expected to be 40%+ next year, with similar growth rates through 2023. Synergies, however, should see profitability metrics improve in the coming years as redundancies in the platforms are removed, similar to any other merger. The idea of this sort of growth with a profitability kicker is attractive to say the least, and why Teladoc's lack of earnings is okay at this point.Speaking of earnings, Livongo makes a small GAAP profit each year, but Teladoc doesn't, so combined, EPS is likely to be near zero. However, that's rather missing the point when it comes to valuing a software company.Source: Investor presentationThese revenue projections are robust, but achievable given the macro tailwinds for telehealth, as well as the companies' own histories of producing organic growth. What I'm interested in is the adjusted EBITDA line, which gives us a proxy for how much the combined companies' profitability could increase over time.This year's combined total should be around $126 million, but three years from now, should be nearly $600 million, or about five times what it is today. Extrapolating that out into the future creates a very strong growth profile, and that's what you're buying. GAAP profits will come, but these companies are investing heavily in scalable growth for the future, so I'm not bothered with a lack of GAAP profits today.Teladoc looks quite attractive to me on its own, but when we consider a merger with Livongo, which certainly appears it will go through at this point, the potential is nearly limitless. The old model of going to a doctor's office may be appropriate for certain kinds of care, but there are many visits that can easily be done via telehealth more cheaply and more conveniently. The telehealth model is old enough that we know for sure it can and does work, so scaling it is really the only obstacle today. My bet is that Teladoc can do that, with or without Livongo, and I think it is a buy."
4383866,105556,2020-11-01T15:14:04-05:00,"COVID-19 is pulling in the emergence of virtual healthcare.Teladoc posted another quarter of triple-digit growth, but the market was unimpressed.The acquisition of Livongo Health in Q4 will distance Teladoc even further from the competition and create many synergies to deliver an even more complete solution.Teladoc’s valuation presents a very reasonable entry point for this generational opportunity.","Teladoc Health (TDOC) recently published its Q3, featuring triple-digit growth. Despite this best-in-class growth and the prospective of adding another best-in-class company to its portfolio in Q4 with the Livongo Health (LVGO) acquisition, the market reacted pretty much flat to these results.With such a quickly growing business, this presents an investment opportunity. Teladoc Health is the leader in virtual healthcare or telehealth. Given the current world environment, this could not be more of a relevant market. Nevertheless, this blending of healthcare and technology is still a nascent space and not just a transient phenomenon. Teladoc has already disclosed its expectation to continue growing at over 30% over the next several years, prior to any synergies.In addition, the acquisition of Livongo Health will further bolster Teladoc’s leadership position in this emerging space. The combined company has even more opportunities for cross-selling, international expansion, etc.As such, an investment in Teladoc Health may not be unlike other generational investments such as Amazon (AMZN) in e-commerce, Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in digital advertising, Facebook (FB) in social media, etc. Put differently, given this large greenfield opportunity likely ahead, one could likely ‘beat the market’ by simply being invested in this one disruptive/transformative company.Teladoc’s accelerated momentum driven by COVID-19 continued in Q3.Given that Teladoc is one of the prime COVID-19 stocks, it is worth separating temporary performance from the long-term opportunity.As one indicator of continued momentum, Teladoc noted that the total number of visits increased sequentially despite the COVID-19-related visits in Q2, and also despite Q3 typically being a seasonally down quarter. The Q4 outlook also calls for further volume growth.Driving this sustainability, Teladoc ascribed some of this performance to acceleration in visits for non-infectious diseases, which represented 50% of volume, up from 33% last year. Not to be outdone, specialty care visits outpaced overall growth even more, as such visits grew 500% in the B2B channel.In similar spirit, Teladoc’s ‘clinical scope’ will obviously take another leap forward with the addition of Livongo Health.Internationally, Teladoc launched a partnership with Telefonica (which has 14 million customers in Spain for example) to offer virtual care to individuals and employees both B2B and D2C. Teladoc’s Nordic expansion also continues.Teladoc also reported progress on its quite recent InTouch acquisition as part of its hospital channel, such as cross-sales, an expanding pipeline and integrated solutions. As another representative win:With respect to 2021 momentum, Teladoc expects to close 2x the amount of bookings in Q4 compared to Q3, indicative of a strong pipeline. Teladoc also notes that two thirds of its sales are multiproduct, which the Livongo acquisition will further augment.Teladoc and Livongo Health announced the much-discussed merger/acquisition last quarter. While Teladoc could perhaps be described as the juggernaut in virtual care, especially Livongo investors saw Livongo as the upcoming, faster growing second player in this space.Instead, the message by both companies was that while they were sort of on a path to become competitors, instead, they saw a much larger opportunity to leverage each others’ strengths to become the definite leader in this space as a combined entity.That view certainly has merit. Livongo does not have an international presence, which leads to the obvious opportunity to leverage Teladoc’s sales network. Additionally, both companies’ solutions are largely and highly complementary, which leads to further cross-sell synergies. Lastly, Teladoc’s triple-digit growth definitely does not give the indication that Livongo is being absorbed by some large, slow growing entity. Instead, both are high technology leaders in their subdomains.So to that end, Teladoc also provided some updates on the pending acquisition, which should be completed in Q4. Teladoc noted that both companies’ integration teams are already making solid progress. Teladoc aims to create a unified go-to-market strategy to be able to offer one seamless, unified, fully integrated solution.Given the technological focus of both companies, Teladoc in fact expects this integration to be smoother than its prior acquisitions. For example, Teladoc anticipates to apply Livongo’s data science to the combined data set of the former’s 10 million visits and the latter’s 750 million data points.Lastly, Teladoc will create an integrated R&D organization.Teladoc also announced it has already achieved its first few major cross-sales.Additional information about the acquisition, such as the expected $121B TAM, can be found in this presentation.Teladoc Health was already on a steady growth path prior to COVID-19, but like many other trends such as EdTech, CPaaS, work-from-home and others, has seen its growth amplified by the current environment. Teladoc could not be more of relevant company in these times as leader in the emerging domain of virtual care. This is not a transient opportunity, but will continue to grow for years to come.This is evidenced by Teladoc’s sequential (and year-over-year) results. Nevertheless, although Teladoc has already rallied considerably in 2020, the stock did not move after another quarter of triple-digit growth.In numbers, with expected revenue of $1 billion in 2020 and a market cap of about $18 billion, Teladoc trades at 18x P/S (although these stats may change post-acquisition). Other high growth names often trade for closer to 30x or even higher. This means that Teladoc presents a very reasonable investment entry point – unlike others high growth names in 2020 such as Twilio (TWLO), Pinterest (PINS), Fastly (FSLY) and Zoom (ZM), which have often rallied to far richer valuations despite lower growth.Looking further out, the combined merger/acquisition of Livongo Health will make Teladoc even more of a juggernaut. Both are purposeful, fast growing companies, and their synergies will only amplify the opportunity ahead."
4370397,103012,2020-08-24T10:26:43-04:00,"Teladoc and Livongo are true innovators in healthcare, and the merger is a win-win for all parties.From a customer's point of view, the combination of the two businesses makes complete sense, bringing healthcare to one place and cutting costs and time for millions of patients.For employers, health plans, and insurers, it gives them a fantastic return on investment, as they can track employees' health, lower healthcare costs, and improve work performance.For the combined entity, the deal enhances the business model, supported by more members, more data points, and more types of diseases in more locations.Finally, as the growth of Telehealth is still at an early stage, we expect an investment today to be highly rewarding in a few years.","At the back of the merger news between the two industry forefront runners, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) and Livongo (NASDAQ:LVGO), our thesis is an optimistic one. We are convinced that telehealth is the future of healthcare. It improves lives, it improves work, it saves time, and it saves costs. For everything else, you have A&E at your local hospital.SourceComing from a father of an infant child, Teladoc + Livongo gives me hope for future parenting experience. In the first year of parenthood, our daughter had so many health issues that my wife and I saw our health deteriorate. Bringing our child for hospital visits often means half a day wasted on admins just to get an answer that an in-depth google search will suffice.We are not advising anyone to do the same or share the same experience with others. Still, we had learned the hard way that when the health issues of our infant daughter were not serious, hospital visits would add unnecessary emotional drain, costs and take away valuable resting time. The combination of Teladoc and Livongo promises a one-stop shop, anytime and anywhere for non-emergency healthcare.Source: Merger presentation Aug 2020Overall, we love the idea of bringing two telehealth giants together, where growth is still in the early stage, and finally, valuation is not sky-high after the recent drop.Covid-19 has been a tear in many industries, but not surprisingly, Teladoc and Livongo have benefited. Both companies reported a dramatic increase in patient visits. Virtual consultations spiked 50% week over week. And revenue increased to 85% and 125% YoY respectively in the latest quarterly results - Q2 2020.The exciting thing is the pandemic has shortened the conversion timeline of early adopters into long-term customers for both companies. This benefit is particularly significant for a relatively new concept/product and market.Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV), a leader in cloud solutions for life sciences, reported a dramatic increase in virtual doctor visits during the pandemic of 30% from 1% of total visit.We are a shareholder of Veeva and consider its data as a leading indicator for the health industry. Thus, a 30x increase in virtual health visits is unprecedented and marks the new beginning for healthcare.Of course, the challenge is to combine the two. M&A studies found that only about 2/3 of cases reported positive revenue synergies.Nevertheless, Livongo + Teladoc together are a superpower in telemedicine, the execution for both companies is already excellent, and the individual strengths are formidable. Let's have a more in-depth look at what we are combining.Source: P.R. releases, TDOC and LVGO Q2 2020 earnings calls (data updated Aug 2020)So, we are combining two publicly-traded telehealth providers who:- Provide patients 24/7 access to doctors/coaches/physicians via voice, telephone, or video to treat acute medical needs (Teladoc) and chronic medical needs (Livongo).- Sell to employer health plan sponsors and managed care companies with contracts that renew yearly (Teladoc) and has traction in Fortune 100 companies (Livongo).- Over 52 million members combined (51M + 410K), multiplying data points.-Global market exposure (mostly Teladoc).- Combined $100B market size and growing at double digits.- Both rapidly growing and scaling businesses with top CEOs.- A blend of reasonably priced and reasonably expensive stock (22x and 50x E.V./Sale).The way we make sense of this combination is that there is an incredible opportunity for an underpenetrated and growing market. The combined TAM is $100B, and according to Statista, telemedicine expects to grow close to 15% CAGR.The following slide put our thesis on a chart. We expect more members, more diseases on the platform, more data points, and more avenues for income.Source: Investor presentationTeladoc and Livongo are expanding like weeds, showing undeniable strength in products, the most recent Q saw 85% (organic growth is 39%, excl acquisition) and 125% increase in revenue, respectively.Both are showing potential with gross profits at very high rates at 63% and 75%, respectively. Economies of scale are evident as operating margins improve rapidly to -8% and -15% from -30% and -55% since IPO, respectively. The primary source of scalability is the reduction in SG&A, implying the products are selling themselves.Source: StockrowHowever, both companies are still making GAAP losses. Nevertheless, Teladoc is generating cash as Q2'2020, and Livongo is approaching break-even. Hence, in the long run, the combined entity should have no problem with sustainability and investment for growth.For the short term, the growth guidance for both companies remain optimistic; Teladoc expects 35% growth at the midpoint, and Livongo, possibly at near triple digits (our est.). What's more exciting is the possibility of a 2-3% margin expansion.Source: Investor presentationIndividually, there are a lot of headlines risks. First, not all countries are willing to approve the use of telemedicine legally and could remain so for the foreseeable future, blunting growth.As both companies are at the forefront of the healthcare industry disruption, we expect plenty of competition and unknowns, such as how the healthcare venture between Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reacts.Then, we have the giants in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and even Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) that are already in the telehealth business in some shape or form.Finally, the execution risk is high, more often a hindrance and disruption than 1+1=3. Only time will tell if the combination creates more value. We just know that both management teams are top class, and we are willing to make a bet on them.The combination of Teladoc and Livongo opens the door to the future of telehealth. If we were the leaders of Google, Apple, or Amazon, we would be kicking ourselves for not capturing these two earlier.The market is still new and highly lucrative. The combination is a statement to the rest of the players in healthcare. It's an early move to strengthen their moat and accelerate growth.As discussed, on different levels, the deal makes sense, a win-win for all parties. From a customer's perspective, it enables healthcare from chronic to acute needs anytime, anywhere at lower costs. It also makes sense for the broader ecosystem as health planners and sponsors can save costs and can participate in improving the health of employees. Finally, it also makes sense for both companies as they combine their superpowers with fast growth and economies of scale.However, valuations are demanding. It implies a successful integration of two business models in different markets and ways of working. For a long-term investor, this is a great time to start a position and accumulate on dips.Nonetheless, investors should expect high volatility. Shortly after the announcement of the deal, share prices of both companies move wildly. The market is still unconvinced with the implications of the combination.We expect more volatility and suggest investors who don't have at least 2-3 years of investing horizon to avoid these stocks. Nevertheless, for those who can stomach large swings, we believe the short-term volatility is the door to superior returns over the long term.What do you think? Are you bullish or bearish of the combination? Leave your comments and feedback below."
4370365,102764,2020-08-24T06:39:03-04:00,"Both Livongo and Teladoc pulled back substantially after the merger announcement.However, the market seems to be coming to terms with the idea recently.Livongo and Teladoc will offer a rock-solid leadership position in the future of healthcare.The deal makes a lot of sense from a strategic perspective.Mergers are always risky and challenging, but the upside potential should more than compensate for the risks over the long term.","Shares of both Livongo (NASDAQ:LVGO) and Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) suffered big declines after the merger announcement on August 5. But now the market seems to be understanding the rationale behind the deal much better, and the two stocks have substantially recovered from their post-announcement drawdowns.It is easy to see why investors may have initially reacted in a negative way to this deal. However, on a forward-looking basis, Livongo and Teladoc offer the opportunity to invest in an undisputed growth leader with enormous potential to benefit from the digital transformation in the healthcare sector over the years ahead.I can perfectly understand why investors would initially feel disappointed with the merger. In fact, and in the interest of full disclosure, I sold half of my Livongo position as the merger was announced on August 5.The deal changes the potential return and reward equation in Livongo, and the stock was the largest position in my portfolio by a wide margin at the time of the announcement after generating a 500% gain in a few months.I generally let my winners run, but when the position is so large and the company makes such a transformative move, it makes sense to take some chips off the table and reassess the investment with more information.However, I also maintained a sizeable position in Livongo stock because I was frankly intrigued by the upside potential of the two companies together. Upon further analysis, I am feeling increasingly confident about the future of Livongo and Teladoc after the merger.The market seems to be having a similar perspective since Livongo and Teladoc have recovered a lot of lost ground in recent days.Data by YChartsThe initial disappointment among investors in the two companies is completely understandable. If you owned Livongo stock, you were holding a disruptive growth stock that was growing revenue at more than 100% year over year and was still relatively small, with enormous room for sustained growth.Investors in Livongo naturally consider that Livongo stock is undervalued based on its long-term potential, so the fact that the stock was sold at a relatively small premium versus the market price at the time can be a disappointment.Investors in Livongo are getting 0.592x shares of Teladoc plus $11.33 in cash for each Livongo share. Teladoc closed at $249.42 on August 4, so this gives a conversion value of $159 while Livongo was trading at $144.53 the day before the merger announcement. Many investors in Livongo were feeling that management sold the company for an insufficient premium.But we also need to consider that these kinds of deals are negotiated over several months, and Livongo stock is up by 404.5% in the past six months while Teladoc has gained 96.77% in the same period.We can't know exactly at what price levels the deal was negotiated, but Livongo was probably much cheaper than Teladoc in comparison to current prices during the negotiations, which means that the premium over market prices for Livogno was obviously much higher at that time.The main reason why the premium looks unimpressive at current levels is that Livongo has delivered massive returns in a relatively short period of time. It is quite a stretch to say that Livongo management should have predicted such a meteoric rise for the stock in a few months. Even if you are aggressively bullish on a stock, these kinds of moves don't happen very frequently.Data by YChartsInvestors in Teladoc could consider that the company paid an excessive price for Livongo. If you own Teladoc stock and you think that the stock is undervalued, then you probably do not want the company to issue more shares in exchange for Livongo.In simple terms, if you own shares in a business and then this business goes through such a transformative merger, then you own something else than what you initially bought. It is perfectly reasonable, and even to be expected, to have some doubts and hesitations about the implications of this deal.Putting this aside, investors need to analyze these kinds of situations on a forward-looking basis. It is not about comparing your stock before the merger versus your stock after the merger. The main question that you need to answer is if you want to own shares in the new company after the deal, and there are some interesting reasons to consider doing so.Mergers and acquisitions can happen from a position of weakness or from a position of strength. Companies with declining growth rates and stagnant fundamentals many times try to buy their way to growth via acquisitions. This rarely ends well for shareholders, there are some things that money can't buy, and a culture of innovation and sustained growth is one of those things.However, both Livongo and Teladoc come to this deal from a position of strength. The two companies have reported very strong numbers in recent quarters, and they have delivered massive returns for investors in the past year. They don't need to do this deal to survive, both parties want to do this deal because they are stronger together.Investors need to consider not only how much Livongo and Teladoc are worth before the acquisition, but also how the value of the two companies changes with this deal. To begin with, Livongo and Teladoc would eventually become competitors without a deal. In the words of Teladoc CEO Jason Gorevic, ""Our two companies were either on a path of convergence or collision."" This transaction is eliminating a major competitive risk for investors in both companies over the long term.Reducing competitive risk is not enough of a reason to justify a merger, but it is clearly a factor that should not be disregarded when assessing the pros and cons of the transaction.Looking at the upside opportunities from this deal, Livongo is the top player in data science technologies to improve the health and the overall quality of life of patients with chronic and behavioral health conditions. Teladoc, on the other hand, is the global leader in virtual care, and the company offers a global leadership position across distribution channels, with over 70 million individuals in the U.S. alone.The combined customer base has only a 25% overlap, so the opportunities for cross-selling and referrals are quite large. Besides, Teladoc has an international presence in over 175 countries, and this could be a game-changer for Livongo in terms of international expansion.Management has identified $500 million in revenue synergy opportunities, and there is a big chance that this estimate will end up being too conservative if it can execute well and successfully capitalize on its opportunities.Source: TeladocThe healthcare system is in urgent need for innovative change. Livongo and Teladoc together are offering personalized care and more efficient solutions, leveraging on massive amounts of patient data and real-time information powered by Artificial Intelligence.Both Livongo and Teladoc have statistically proven to produce better outcomes for patients and lower healthcare costs, and combining the two platforms opens the door to exciting possibilities for even better results over the long term.The pandemic has accelerated demand for both companies, and regulators are rapidly recognizing that we need to provide better solutions. Demand has never been higher, the technology is more powerful than ever, and regulations for virtual healthcare exceptionally favorable. This is the right deal, and it comes at the right time.Mergers and acquisitions always carry significant challenges and implementation risks, and this is no exception. However, the healthcare industry is going through a major transformation, and this is going to produce massive opportunities for growth in the years and decades ahead.The merger between Livongo and Teladoc gives birth to an undisputed powerhouse with exceptional potential for growth. If you are looking to invest in the future of healthcare, Livongo and Teladoc could offer a fairly unique opportunity to do so."
4370409,98236,2020-08-24T11:06:18-04:00,"Teladoc has announced plans to acquire Livongo creating the largest business in the teleheath space.Merger terms seem fair to me-although there has been some disgruntlement on the part of investors in both companies.On a pro-forma basis, the new company will start life with about 138 million outstanding shares and with a small amount of net debt.Both Livongo and Teladoc enjoyed what can only be described as halcyon quarters for the period ending 6/30.While I do not anticipate that growth for either company can continue at the rates each enjoyed last quarter, I do think the new enterprise will enjoy a CAGR of 35%+ for the next 4 years.","This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.On August 5th, at the time of Livongo’s (LVGO) formal announcement of its Q2 financial results, the company announced that it had concluded a merger agreement with Teladoc Health (TDOC). Not terribly surprisingly, Livongo’s results themselves were a significant beat-the way all of Livongo’s quarters have been. Specifically, revenues rose by 125% as reported-about 35% sequentially. All of the revenue and cost metrics showed favorable trends and handily exceeded prior expectations. Because of the favorable unit economics, the company was able to report positive non-GAAP net income, albeit at a modest level. Operating cash flow was still negative, although that was mainly a function of the increase in other assets as the business scaled. What was surprising is that the company had already pre-announced an upside in early July, and went on to beat that preannouncement by a fairly noticeable amount. As the saying goes, when you are hot, you’re hot!The question now becomes, what action should shareholders in both company’s take? Is the newly created enterprise one that will be able to provide investors with positive alpha after both companies have seen such strong share price performance since the start of the pandemic? My answer is that the share price reaction seen in response to the merger (a pullback of more than 20%) has provided investors with an attractive entry point. Current estimates seem conservative to me; the provision of remote health services is a space that has one of the stronger secular growth stories both now and after the pandemic comes to an end. While the exceptional results of Q2 brought on by a response to the conditions of the pandemic will likely not be specifically reprised in terms of percentage growth in future quarter, strong growth in the telehealth space seems inevitable. And putting together two strong companies, will provide both revenue and cost synergies, most likely beyond the base levels forecast by management in their conference call to discuss the strategy of the merger.Some investors are going to question the extent to which the Q2 results, particularly those posted by Teladoc, are a one time event, and just what future percentage growth might be for the company. I have no more crystal ball on the subject than the next person, other than personal experience which is hardly dispositive. But regardless of how much of Q2’s upside was a function of the conditions brought on by the pandemic, I think that it is highly unlikely that acceptance of telehealth by patients will return to the far more modest growth cadence seen in prior quarters. Of course in making that assertion I am echoing the CEO-but then, who else might I believe. As discussed below, and again for what it is worth, 3rd party research supports long-term growth of close to 40% in the space, and the addition of Livongo should further solidify growth expectations. But rather than me trying to advance the high-growth thesis, the foregoing are the specific quote of the company’s CEO on the subject-and if I am going to leave readers with anything, these quotes, taken from the company's most recent earnings conference call, even if they are a trifle longer than I might like, set the table for readers to make an informed decision on this name:“yan Daniels -- William Blair & Company -- AnalystThank you for taking the questions. Jason, maybe one for you. Clearly, we've seen telehealth move into the mainstream on a very rapid basis, and I guess the only really outstanding question is, what's the long-term reimbursement outlook? But I'm curious what you guys are doing, from a marketing or just an engagement standpoint, to ensure that this momentum continues, that it's not near term in nature and that this really does become mainstream and is kind of a typical form of utilization for consumers as we look forward over the next few years?Jason Gorevic -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Thanks, Ryan. I'd say a couple of things. First of all, the momentum that we're seeing is broad-based across the entire business, which is a really strong indicator and gives me tremendous confidence that this not only has become part of the mainstream but will continue to grow at a very strong clip.We are continuing to use our engagement engine in order to drive first-time users, right? And so if you saw -- or if you heard in the prepared remarks, first-time users were up significantly, new registrations up over 150% year over year. And as we talked about in our Investor Day at the beginning of March, once we get them in the top of the funnel, then the flywheel takes effect. And we're seeing people who used more than one clinical service increase substantially over the course of this quarter relative to prior quarters. So I think all of those things serve to make this part of consumers' every day thought process about how they access care.And then lastly, I would say, enabling the providers to deliver virtual care on our platform will serve to make virtual care part of how consumers expect to get healthcare not a novelty, which it may have been just a few years ago.OperatorYour next question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Your line is open.Lisa Gill -- J.P. Morgan -- AnalystThanks. Jason, congratulations on another outstanding quarter. As we think about 2021 -- and thank you for giving that preliminary outlook. I just want to understand just a couple of different components to this.I appreciate the numbers that you put out there for InTouch. If I were to back out what Mala just talked about, it looks like you're still anticipating that the organic growth rate is going to be in that 20% to 30% range, even though the company is materially bigger than what it was. I'm just curious as to what your anticipation is, going forward, for utilization trends. And I think you talked a little bit about this in your prepared remarks that even in places where things have started to open back up, you're still seeing strong utilization.But maybe if, one, you could start there and talk a little bit about that. And then two, how does the selling season kind of backfill into that? You talked about a new client coming on in October, but how do things look for 1/1/2021?Jason Gorevic -- Chief Executive OfficerOK. You got a lot in there, Lisa. Thanks for the question and your comments. So I'll start with visit volumes and utilization.As I mentioned at the sort of bottom of the U-shaped curve, we were seeing visit volumes roughly 40% higher than pre-COVID, even as we were in sort of the slower summer months. And so that gives us a good insight into what to expect in the back half of the year and looking into next year. We're going to stop short of giving long-term utilization ranges. But I think, again, we mentioned that we're seeing twice the rate of growth that we were seeing prior to the COVID onset.And so I think you can sort of triangulate on where we're going relative to visit volumes and utilization. And again, that gives us tremendous confidence in next year. The second thing relative to the selling season that also gives us confidence is that our bookings are up about 70% -- a little more than 70% year over year. And in every single channel that we look at, they're up at least 50% year over year for the first half of this year.Two-thirds of our bookings are for multi-product sales, which is up from about 50% last year. So we're seeing that trend continue. And our average deal size is up 50% year over year on top of what was a 50% increase last year. So all of those things give us tremendous confidence as we look into the growth into the future.”It seems quite self-evident to me, that the management of this company has substantial confidence in forecasting a multi-year organic growth trend well above 30%.I am sometimes asked by subscribers to compile names that they can hold for an extended period because of secular trends. It is always difficult in the IT space to make such recommendations. I might say I wouldn’t have a business if I could find names that can be set and forgotten. The real world doesn’t often work to the specific desires of longer term investors. I have had recent occasion to sell positions in even my most favorite names, if for no other reason than they have gone too far, too fast. But if a reader is looking for an investment that should still be achieving hyper growth for several years into the future, and is a leader in the space, with a business model that should achieve decent profitability over time, than a I believe a commitment in the shares of TDOC will make sense.In the past, I have not written about TDOC. More a function of available bandwidth than anything else. For readers unfamiliar with TDOC, it offers virtual health care services on a B to B basis for a variety of clinical conditions. It can be tedious to recite all of the specifics of the company's offering-for those interested in exactly what it does, this link will be useful: https://teladochealth.com/what-we-do/ The company was founded in 2002, and it is headquartered just outside New York City.Growth has basically taken off since 2016 when the company had revenues of just $123 million. Last year, the company reported revenues of $553 million, and this year the company is projecting revenues of just less than $1 billion, with about 5% of that total coming from the company’s recent acquisition of InTouch Health. Over the past years, the company has absorbed some smaller companies in the field, and before the acquisition of InTouch, it acquired Teledietian at the end of 2018.It is probably not terribly surprising to most readers to find that TDOC shares have enjoyed strong appreciation this year, reaching a recent high of $249, after starting the year at $83. Much of the share price appreciation has been a function of the pandemic, and the strong tailwind created for telehealth services. In the most recent quarter that ended 6/30, sequential growth reached over 33%. Many Americans could not receive traditional in-person care because of the demands for additional health care service created by the pandemic and turned to telehealth as an alternative. It actually happened to this writer as a leading hospital in NYC, Mt. Sinai, closed for all non-essential visits.While the availability of in person health services is likely to improve, the service level that can be achieved using telehealth has generated strong momentum for this company, that is likely to persist into the future.As I detail below, I believe that the combined company will exit 2020 with a quarterly revenue run rate of $425 million. I tentatively forecast that the company will achieve total revenues in 2021 of between $2050 million and $2.1 billion; as Livongo does not have any significant level of deferred revenues (less than $7 million) the write down of deferred revenues should not be a significant factor in forecasting 2021 revenues. With an estimated pro-forma enterprise value of just over $25 billion, the calculated forward EV/S ratio for 2021 is about 12X. That ratio is at least 30% below the average for companies in the mid-30% growth cohort, and yet given the revenue synergies and the strong secular demand tailwinds, my guess is that growth will be higher than that. This valuation seems to me to be an excellent entry point in the sharesAt some level, and based on the responses I have had from subscribers to my Ticker Target investment service, quite a few Livongo shareholders were unhappy with the merger, and presumably some of them have sold their shares. In one sense, I think there disappointment is well founded. The new combined business is not likely to grow at the rates Livongo has most recently achieved although I would maintain the terms of the deal provide Livongo shareholders a significant recognition of its faster growth compared to that of Teladoc.And self-evidently, a substantial number of Teladoc shareholders have voted against the merger with their wallets: the shares have been down by as much as 25% since the merger was announced, compared to a decline of 7% for the CLOU index-although they have recently bounced some in the wake of a recommendation by the CS analyst.There is no doubt that TDOC shareholders are getting diluted in the transaction. Just how much is in the eyes of the beholder as there are many ways to calculate something like dilution. TDOC has produced guidance that accepted literally suggests Q4 revenue of $289 million. That guidance is highly suspect by this writer as it implies negligible sequential growth from the guidance the company has provided for Q3, of $285 million which in itself is highly conservative. Last year, sequential growth in Q4 was 13%; that compared to guidance which had called for around 9% sequential growth.Teladoc’s sequential growth in Q2 was 33%. Of course that is an outlier reflecting the specific circumstances of obtaining any kind of health care in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. The company is forecasting sequential organic growth of less than 5% in Q3. There are reasons why sequential growth in Q3 will moderate; the specific number provided here is more of a guess than a real forecast. The pandemic has dramatically changed the demand environment for telehealth. I don’t think it is necessary to detail how the pandemic made in-person health visits far more difficult to schedule. While it seems highly likely that the level of telehealth visits has reached a new, far greater level than heretofore, no one can really know the progress of acceptance of telehealth visits in future quarters. The Teladoc business model is one of sales to major employers and other healthcare payers-coupled with a major effort to drive engagement by end users. I think it is self-evident that the economics for employers are extremely attractive. One particular case study cited in a recent investor presentation can be seen here: http://s21.q4cdn.com/672268105/files/doc_presentations/2020/03/InvestorDay2020.pdf. The quantification for an employer is displayed on pgs. 15-18 and is quite significant.Historically, this has been a business that has seen some lower level of sequential usage during the summer. It is difficult to know if that is going to be the case this year; presumably the relatively low level of sequential growth being forecast in Q3 includes a seasonal component.There are always a number of puts and takes in looking at quarterly revenue progression and no doubt more so for a company providing remote health services in the midst of a pandemic. Further, the company acquired InTouch Health as of July 1st, 2020. InTouch is expected to generate about $65 million in revenues in the 2nd half of 2020 but I do not think it will significantly impact seasonal revenue patterns. I think in putting together some estimates, using 8% sequential growth in Q4 revenues, or in other words an estimate for the period of $308 million seems reasonable.As Livongo is getting bought, it did not choose to provide specific guidance, although given how much the company has exceeded guidance, I am not terribly sure just how much credibility could be put in their guidance. The company reported revenue for the period of $92 million, up 125% year over year. That number included a one-time non-recurring revenue benefit of $2.5 million based on some milestone attainments with clients. The company also tracks a metric for EVA-Enterprise Value of Agreements, which grew 46% year over year in Q2 to $109 million. Sequential growth in the period accelerated sharply to 35.5%. Because of the nature of the Livongo service, seasonality is not a factor in revenue attainment; the company offers services for chronic illnesses which need to be treated throughout the year. I think some kind of conservative expectation for growth in the coming quarters would be at a 50% annual rate. So, tentatively, I think Livongo will achieve revenues in Q4 of about $116 million. That suggests that the total revenues in Q4 for the combined business would be around $425 million, with Livongo’s “share” being 28%.Based on the details of the transaction, the company will start life with about 138 million shares. Based on share prices as of 8/21, the company's pro-forma market cap would be about That computes to a market cap. of $31.5 billion. Livongo shareholders will receive a cash consideration of about $1.2 billion, and that will leave the new company with net debt of about $480 million-although the combined company will have plenty of liquidity, and reasonable access to capital markets. That establishes a pro-forma enterprise value of $32 billion, and that is the basis for some of the foregoing valuation analysis. The question really isn’t who got the better deal or how much the percentage dilution to Teladoc shareholders might be, but whether the new company which is being formed can show significant appreciation from current levels. In the interest of full disclosure, I initiated positions in the shares last week at average prices of about $189. Obviously the share have appreciated significantly since that time, but as I am a longer term investor, I wasn't playing for the move seen over the past week.I have written about Livongo 3 times this year-and recommended it 3 times. Although I have personally not owned the shares, or included them in the portfolios that I manage, I am nonetheless pleased that the denouement of my coverage has been positive. Overall, Livongo was $28/share when I first recommended the shares on the pages of SA, and even after the pullback since the merger was initially announced, it is up by more than 4 times in the last 7 months. That doesn’t happen all that often, and I am grateful for the result.But now, Livongo will become a part of Teladoc, with the Livongo shareholders receiving 42% of the outstanding shares in the new business in addition to a cash consideration of $11.33/share. At least initially, the reaction of Teladoc investors has been negative; they are getting significantly diluted in terms of the revenue contributions of both partners to the new enterprise. The transaction was based on a significant level of revenue and cost synergies which I think is a modest expectation; Teladoc, prior to the merger had already forecast that it would achieve organic growth in 2021 of 30%-40% and I have no reason to doubt that forecast. Obviously, the addition of Livongo, which has been able to grow faster that TDOC because of the strength of its very specific target market is going to noticeably increase expected growth for the combined company. Given a quarterly base of $425 million, and expected growth of close to 35%+ for the combined entity, yields a 2021 sales estimate of around $2.1-$2.15 billion, and a forward EV/S of 15.3X. That is substantially below average for a company with a mid-high 30% growth rate cohort, and given the potential synergies it represents a substantial under-valuation.It seems like such a simple concept. Provide professional medical advice for non-life threatening conditions via a broad range of communications devices such as a phone, or the web. A doctor, or other qualified medical professional can ""visit"" you on your smart phone, either via an appointment, or on an emergency basis. Many readers will be familiar with WebMD. But many potential users want a professional on the other end of the communication rather than read something on WebMD. Teladoc allows its subscribers to talk with a licensed physician and avoid the time, the hassle and perhaps the issues of safety in reaching an office. Much of what happens in a doctor’s office at relatively great expense doesn’t need to take place physically. The fact is that Telehealth is quicker, cheaper and generally provides users with a better experience.The formula for growth at scale for Teladoc is pretty straightforward. Recruit more members; offer more products, increase utilization of clinicians and facilitate more payment models. Again, it seems relatively straightforward but the devil is in the details and in executing against the formula. One reason for the Livongo merger is that it helps the new business tick more boxes in terms of members, products, utilization and perhaps payment models.Teladoc had achieved reasonable growth even before the pandemic. Overall, through 2019 the company had achieved a CAGR of 55% since the date of the company's IPO in 2015. But the fact is that the cadence was more steady than break-through, and while the concept seemed straightforward, end-user acceptance was simply not growing at exceptional rates. But the pandemic has come, and it has obviously changed end-user acceptance of telehealth solutions. The linked article from research done by Frost and Sullivan presents a high-level, quantitative view of what is happening: Telehealth set for 'tsunami of growth,' says Frost & Sullivan. While I perhaps might not use the tag of tsunami, a 38% CAGR over 5 years is pretty impressive.Even before the merger with Livongo, TDOC was the leader in global virtual care. The company offers points of presence from China and Australia, through Europe, South America and the US. It had 2400 employees as of this spring, with 450 medical sub specialties and arrangements with more than 50k clinicians. The company went public in 2015. The shares were offered then at $19, and first traded at $29.90. The shares were still ""only"" $83 at the start of the year, before the tailwinds of increasing usage and the pandemic resulted in the appreciation of 158% so far this year.There are lots of companies in the telehealth space. Two of them, MDLive and Amwell, are scheduled to go public over the coming months. Having a first mover advantage is obviously an important consideration in a field like this. But I imagine that in the long term, one of the key differentiators will be marketing. End users have been reluctant to pivot from the age old practice of wanting to see a doctor in person. Given that end-users do not see a direct link between the age-old paradigm of in-person visits to a physician, and the costs of health care that they must pay i one way or the other, this isn’t terribly surprising. While third party payers, for the most part, are on board with the pivot to virtual solution, that means little unless end-user/patients choose to use the service.For example, NYU Langone is a major healthcare provider in the NYC area. For some time, even though telehealth was an available option, the hospital was only processing 50 telehealth visits each day. While the pandemic essentially broke the log jam, the fact is that aggressive marketing will still be required to bend the usage curve strongly upward and to the left. Currently the telehealth program at Langone, is processing 400 virtual visits daily. The administrator was quoted as saying that there is no conceivable way that visits will revert to anywhere close to pre pandemic levels-the benefits are so apparent to end-users and to health care professionals.Teladoc has been focused on its marketing strategy and has the assets and capability to make it happen-and that should be enhanced as it integrates with the capabilities of Livongo. The company has made a major commitment to develop its channel. It has on-boarded a variety of channel partners, and of course this year, most notably it has been certified by Medicare, and Medicaid as a reimbursed service. I have linked here to the recent order signed by the president which permanently expands telehealth benefits for Medicare recipients beyond just the order enacted to deal with the Covid-19 emergency. President Trump Signs Executive Order to Permanently Expand Telehealth Benefits for Medicare Recipients There have been few ways for Medicare to remediate its rising level of costs; telehealth is one of those very few ways that seems to have substantial promise.In addition to a focus on the channel, the company continues to offer new lines of clinical services and it provides analytics and monitoring to insure favorable outcomes. The company is also focused on accelerating consumer adoption. It has built it offering based on intuitive and integrated services, and it has focused on something called engagement science. And no, I hadn’t heard the term heretofore, or realized that it existed, but it is a logical evolution of how to encourage acceptance of something like telehealth benefits in a large enterprise. Here is a more thorough description of how companies, and in particular companies such as Teladoc can use engagement science to achieve successful outcomes in terms of on-boarding patients within the large enterprise that are Teladoc’s customer constituency (see here).Does Teladoc have a “better” marketing and on-boarding strategy than its smaller rivals. I obviously do not want to be glib and offer a comprehensive answer. But in this case, the first mover advantage, and the advantage of size would seem to suggest that TDOC will maintain a leadership position in what is one of the key issues regarding the pervasive use of telemedicine. I think the recent merger with InTouch and the pending merger with Livongo are both likely to cement the marketing advantages that Teladoc has enjoyed.Over the past several years, Teladoc has invested about $1 billion in a variety of acquisitions. These acquisitions have broadened the company’s footprint substantially, adding to the different products that the company offers. The company has lots of successful experience in selling the products of acquired companies into its legacy base of customers, and of cross selling its suite of solutions into the base of acquired customers. I think this bodes well for the successful integration of Livongo, and the achievement of the company’s revenue synergy goals.In trying to assess the forward outlook for Teladoc particularly, some readers may be concerned about the potential for an enterprise company such as Zoom Tech (ZO) or perhaps Ring Central (RNG) to enter the space. I would observe that the marketing and specific product skills needed to compete with what TDOC can offer these days is a substantial barrier. While there isn’t one single thing that TDOC does that cannot somehow be replicated, the barrier to entry is really the combination all of the various components that TDOC offers through a unified service delivery capability that makes it difficult for both current competitors and potential new entrants to become substantial competitive threats.As mentioned, last quarter for Teladoc, was a breakthrough quarter in terms of most business metrics. For readers unfamiliar with the company’s business model, revenues come from two sources. One is subscription revenues that the company receives from payers, and the other is the revenue that the company receives for paid visits. At this point subscriptions are about 75% of total revenues. The company has a relatively modest international business at this point, although as mentioned earlier, it has global points of presence. Last quarter, US revenues rose by around 100% overall, while international revenues only grew 15%. Unfortunately, the reasons for this kind of divergence-or the reasons for international under-performance were not discussed on the earnings conference call.Needless to say, the component of revenue tied to ""visit fee only access"" spiked substantially-it was up over 400% as individuals suffering from the pandemic turned to any available source of treatment. It is probably reasonably to anticipate that this revenue line, which was about 8% last quarter will decline noticeably as the crisis of access to some kind of physician care due to Covid-19 appears to have passed.The company on-boarded some relatively large health plan populations over the past year, and because of the pricing of these new plans, the revenue per user declined a bit. The decline in average revenue per user lead to a modest year on year decline in gross margins, but gross margins rebounded sharply from Q1 levels due to better utilization of physician resources. There is likely to be a consistent mis-match between the on-boarding of large populations of users, physician capacity and the rate of individual access. Over time, one of the key components of success in this business model is to achieve high rates of engagement from the new populations that have been. The business model here is a complex, and inter-related flywheel in which new payer organizations are sold, user engagement ramps, and payers extend their relationships with Teladoc.The huge sequential spike in quarterly revenue of around 33%, had a corresponding impact on operating cost ratios. While GAAP expenses rose 63% year over year, and by about 22% sequentially, the increase in revenues substantially exceeded the increase in costs and the operating expense ratio declined by 2000 basis points. On a non-GAAP basis, the improvement in operating cost ratios was 1200 bps year on year.Overall, non-GAAP EBITDA increased by about 4X year over year, and operating cash flow margin reached more than 14% last quarter compared to a modest cash burn in Q1. The company has a modest level of capex-overall; the free cash flow margin for the first half of the calendar year was 6.6%.One thing to point out to readers, which will be noted as well in the valuation discussion: Teladoc is not a software company and its cost of revenues is the costs it incurs in delivering its service-not just in arranging for cloud software access. There are live doctors and PA’s involved in delivering Teladoc’s service, and while utilization can rise, this business model will never be able to achieve software gross margins.The other side of that equation is that sales and marketing costs are, and will always be far lower as an expense ratio than is typical in the software space. Last quarter may have been a bit of an outlier, but the GAAP sales and marketing expense ratio was just 27% last quarter, and was just 28% for the first 6 months of the year. In addition, the company’s technology expense, at 9.5% GAAP last quarter, is far less than would be typical for most software companies as their level of spend on the equivalent research and development expense bucket.It is, no doubt, difficult to compare the overall business model of Teladoc to that of a software company of equivalent size. I think, overall, that the unit economics are likely to be a bit stronger for TDOC than for many other software companies since utilization can be a major contributor to positive gross margin trends. But utilization trends can be difficult to forecast as the company, particularly at its current size can close a couple of significant transactions with payers and in turn this can visibly move the needle when it comes to utilization statistics.But overall, TDOC is such an early stage of its evolution that I think investors are well advised not to focus too much on profitability and more on the company’s success in promoting telehealth as a mainstream component of health service delivery.I mentioned at the start of this article that one of the principle questions of significance is whether or not the incredible spike that the company saw in demand in the US in Q2 might continue. I really have nothing more to say than to reference the quote at the start of this article. The company’s CEO, Jason Gorevic has forecast, without any equivocation whatsoever, that it will. Telehealth simply is a better solution for most of us-particularly those of us who are at a certain age and far prefer not to have to go through the hassles of visiting physicians. Any day I can avoid a physical visit to a doctor, a clinic or a hospital is a very happy day.As I mentioned earlier, many of the readers of my investment blog initially opined that they were disappointed with the terms of the merger. I personally do not think the terms of the merger should be all that tough for Livongo shareholders. They are going to wind up with 42% of the equity in what will unquestionably be the leader in the telehealth space. It will grow less rapidly than Livongo by itself-but not really that much less rapidly over the next several years. But regardless, I cant really indulge in “might have beens.” I think the merger has a very high chance of consummation, although I have chosen, personally, to buy Teladoc shares in order to avoid any kind of arbitrage risk.The major reason for the merger was to unlock $500 million of revenue synergies coupled with 200-300 bps of annual adjusted margin improvement-both over the next 4 years through 2025 The company has forecast a ’20-’23 pre-synergy CAGR of between 30%-40%. I think the cross selling opportunities are fairly self-evident. If a patient is already using the Livongo paradigm to manage his diabetes, he is an excellent candidate to use some of Teladoc’s multiplicity of virtual services. Similarly, Teladoc users who suffewr from chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, probably will be interested in manage the care of their chronic conditions using Livongo. Just how long it takes to get this set-up and for marketing and education efforts to drive results is obviously not completely knowable at this point.There is very little overlap between the offering of both vendors-the companies believe the overlap is only 25%. While Teladoc does have some chronic care offerings, almost all of the Livongo’s users are unique to it. If it all works out, I think the combined enterprise can probably reach revenues of $5-$6 billion based on growth falling from the mid-high 30% range to around the low 30% range in 2025. with adjusted EBITDA of around $700 million, and still exceeding 25% growth at the end of the period.The specifics of revenue synergies included cross selling and up selling to both shared and unshared clients. Teladoc has established a significant international business-Livongo has not yet done so. It seems likely to this writer that the combined offering is likely to help jump start international penetration. Beyond cross selling, it seems likely that Teladoc users will be referred to Livongo’s services as part of the care provided when users make a Teladoc visit. The combined company will be able to afford more efficient member enrollment and to build programs to minimize churn. There are surely other opportunities, some of significance, others of which will not be major revenue generators over the next few years including virtual primary care beyond what is currently offered by Teladoc, a concept called “hospital in the home” and risk based models.Currently, Livongo has focused on just a few offerings, most notably diabetes and hypertension. It also has a mental health offering. Of course these offerings presumably offer the lowest hanging fruit, but part of the benefit of the merger is that it should readily enable the new entity to step up the cadence of additional offerings. Part of the merger presentation highlighted that there are currently 147 million American with chronic illnesses, and that 90% of US health care spending is attributable to both chronic illness or behavioral conditions. These are huge numbers, and presumably the new Teladoc will have the resources to address the overall opportunity.In the case of Teladoc, most of its users are sick, or need a check up and have never thought of the potential for managing their conditions using telehealth. The use of extensions of the telehealth technology, including advanced data science/analytics to help members modify their behavior is another opportunity whose realization may be currently difficult to quantify, but whose realization, at least in part might be anticipated to achieve some fruition in the coming years as part of a combined offering from the new enterprise.Part of the interest I have in my work is seeing the creation of new enterprises and learning about new solutions. In evaluating the combination of Livongo and Teladoc, I see the likely creation of a major new enterprise that offers many of us a new way to receive health care that is far more efficient and less time consuming. It is also far cheaper for payers, in general, and winds up providing users with better health outcomes. And it should be able to do this profitably and at scale.I am not going to try to establish a price target, especially in evaluating a business like this which is still in the gestation process. As I calculate it, the pro-forma enterprise value is currently around $32 billion. If my broad scenario works out, I would be hard pressed to think that the enterprise value would be less than $60 billion; $75-$90 billion is not a huge stretch to contemplate depending on terminal growth rates and the exact level of free cash flow. At some point, and I don’t think that point is quite yet, being the leader in the telehealth space will command a significant premium as the use of telehealth solutions becomes globally ubiquitous-or at least that is my expectation.As mentioned, I have an 8% position in the high-growth portfolio I publish for Ticker Target subscribers. I also have a weighting in the same range for the portfolios I actually manage. I am a long-term investor with a pretty encompassing focus on IT, and I think Teladoc is the kind of name that ticks most boxes and can be part of a high-growth portfolio for years to come. I do not expect that the spike in demand the company experienced last quarter will continue, although I think the guidance TDOC management provided is likely to prove to be quite conservative. I believe that TDOC shares can generate positive alpha from their current price for the next year, and well beyond that."
4367494,105040,2020-08-11T10:01:52-04:00,"I initially sold out of my LVGO position fully because the merger looked terrible at first glance.However, after I looked more into TDOC, I realized that the merger could provide substantial benefits for both companies and create the healthcare company of the future.TDOC's flywheel has substantially accelerated due to COVID-19 and the company should benefit from the fast-growing adoption of telehealth.While the valuation may seem high, when considering synergies and the impact of COVID-19 on telehealth, the valuation actually seems quite cheap.","Well, it's official - Teladoc (TDOC) has acquired Livongo (LVGO), creating one of the largest and fastest-growing subscription healthcare players. In this article, I'll breakdown my short-term and long term thoughts on the merger as an LVGO shareholder, and I'll give my analysis on TDOC as well, which I haven't covered in previous articles.Initially, when I read the merger headline, I thought I had misread something. With Livongo growing at over 100% with plenty of financing available in the current market, there really was no need to sell out to any company. After a few seconds, when I realized that the news was real, my immediate thought was that the deal was terrible for Livongo. Recall from my past article about Livongo that it was in an incredibly huge market with little competition and substantial competitive advantages. Buying such a great company, which I thought could've easily been worth over $100bil in 5 years, for around $15bil was an incredible steal in my opinion.Looking into the deal further, I saw that I would receive mostly TDOC shares, with a little bit of cash thrown in for good measure. Since I was unfamiliar with TDOC and since I disliked the deal in general, I decided to sell my shares premarket for $153, which turned out to be a great move.1-2 hours later, the market had opened and LVGO had dropped over 10%, with TDOC dropping nearly 20%. At this point, I had completed some research regarding TDOC's business and decided I liked the deal after all, so I put some, but not all, of my LVGO proceeds into TDOC stock. Currently, I still hold my TDOC shares and plan to hold them for the long run.Teladoc is the largest telemedicine company in America. Telemedicine is basically the virtual equivalent of going to a doctor and includes virtual video/voice calls directly with a doctor as well as virtual prescriptions. While it may seem like a pay per use business model, TDOC actually generated over 80% of its revenue from subscriptions in 2019, so the business is more like a SaaS business.Telehealth has steadily grown in America over the past few years due to its lower cost compared to in-person visits, but it has only really started to take off now due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Source: GoogleAs people become more fearful of going out and as hospitals continue to shut down, the only way for people to get medical attention is telemedicine, and of course, as the largest player in telemedicine, TDOC is a major beneficiary. According to the Q2 call, there has been 150% new registration growth and visit volume has doubled from normal levels.I believe the strong registration volume only marks the start of a multi-year growth increase for the telehealth industry. After many more people try out telehealth for the first time, there will undoubtedly be many that will love the cost savings and convenience of using telehealth and become repeat customers. This will bring TDOC's growth forward by several years and dramatically accelerate the company's flywheel.Source: Investor presentationThe main difference between TDOC and LVGO is that generally, TDOC is mainly for patients suffering from acute conditions while LVGO is mainly for patients who are suffering from chronic conditions. This can be illustrated by the diagram below:Source: Merger presentationHowever, since many patients can fall under both categories from time to time, and since patients can have family members who are suffering from either condition, it would be preferable for these patients to have both solutions handy. The merger will create an integrated solution that can serve either population of patients and thus drive adoption and word of mouth, creating a much more valuable sum of the parts.The LVGO acquisition will bring TDOC into chronic diseases, a massive market in great need of an improved solution. At the same time, it will give LVGO access to TDOC's large footprint in 175 countries, which will further help to accelerate LVGO's incredible growth. According to the merger presentation, there is only 25% client overlap, which shows substantial opportunity for cross-selling.I believe the combined company will pretty much represent the future of healthcare, offering a personalized, digitalized solution that will be a major step forward in lowering costs and improving outcomes for all patients involved. With a highly scalable and reliable solution, a broad product portfolio spanning many areas of healthcare, and data on millions of patients, it will be difficult to compete with the combined company.The virtual healthcare opportunity is enormous, especially after the recent COVID-19 crisis. McKinsey estimates that up to $250bil of healthcare spend could potentially be virtualized, up from $3bil currently. I believe the TDOC and LVGO combination will create an unmatched leader in virtual healthcare that could potentially become a giant in the healthcare sector.All of LVGO's revenue comes from subscription, and while TDOC generated over 80% of revenues from subscriptions last year, it still derives a substantial amount of revenue from one-time visits.Both TDOC and LVGO saw record revenue growth in the quarter, with TDOC growing 85% and LVGO growing 125%. Both companies saw substantial operating leverage and a drastic narrowing of operating losses, which bodes well for the long-term viability of the business model.After the merger, the combined company will likely have an EV of close to $30bil, representing around 30x LTM revenue. This is pricey, but if you factor in the $500mil in revenue synergies expected, which should be worth over $10bil according to TDOC's current multiple, the multiple declines to around 20x.Source: Merger presentation20x still seems high for a company estimated to grow around 30-40% CAGR excluding synergies, but keep in mind that COVID-19 has led to an inflection point in telehealth, with not only more people trying it out but also more governments passing favorable regulations regarding telehealth use. For example:In other companies that have seen an inflection point, like Zoom Video (ZM), multiples are much higher, with ZM currently sporting a 39x multiple for 2020E revenue. This shows that there is substantial room for TDOC to increase multiples. I believe the main reason TDOC's multiple is lower is that it offers a onetime visit product while ZM only offers subscription products. I believe that TDOC's subscription growth should accelerate further as more new users start to convert to subscribers.After selling my LVGO position, I have put part of the proceeds into TDOC to try and benefit from the next leg of its journey to become a major player in the healthcare industry. Telemedicine will only continue to grow in popularity as regulations continue to shift in its favor and as more consumers start trying it out due to COVID-19, and we believe the combined company is best positioned to take advantage of this."
4368238,41961,2020-08-13T02:57:39-04:00,"Teladoc and Livongo's planned merger brings together two of the dominant digital healthcare solutions providers.Given common customer targets and areas of focus, cost synergies should be easily attainable.Cross sell and co marketing are significant revenue opportunities and make logical sense.More importantly, the combination offers the opportunity for substantial engagement of members which should boost overall solution stickiness.","Livongo’s (LVGO) recent merger with Teladoc (TDOC) surprised a lot of people, including myself. That the business felt the need to merge with slower growing, less sticky Teladoc was a little strange when Livongo itself was most recently able to demolish its own guidance and grow revenue 124% in its most recent quarter and increase user membership over 113%. That Teladoc felt the need to turn around and merge with an entity as large as itself, so soon after swallowing InTouch for $600M just a few months ago was equally surprising!At first glance, merging the two businesses seems an unlikely pairing. User engagement is very different between the businesses. While Livongo plays a very active role in the daily lives of its members, assisting them with frequent nudges and regulating the monitoring of their condition, Teladoc has a perception of being more infrequently utilized by members, functioning as more of a ""backup service"" to urgent care.This helps explain utilization rates that have been hovering around 10% of total members. Telemedicine has also suffered from the perception of being inadequate for physical exams of patients with an inability to dive too deeply into more complex conditions.Source: Teladoc Investor Day, March 2020The presence of the pandemic has been a boon for both businesses with Teladoc utilization rates increasing due to members who still require medical consultations, and Livongo members benefiting from the ability to get ongoing monitoring of their chronic conditions in the absence of access to their existing medical provider or other specialist offices.The Livongo-Teladoc deal was announced based on the identification of up to $500M in revenue synergies within a few years and close to $60M in annual cost synergies by the end of the 2nd year after close. Its typically been my experience that while cost synergies are far more frequently realized, revenue synergies sometimes tend to come unstuck as a result of execution challenges. For the Livongo Teladoc merger to make sense, there needs to be a good shot at these synergies being realized.It's fairly easy to make the case for shared cost savings between the two businesses. Livongo and Teladoc serve many of the same type of customers (self managed enterprises, health insurers). Thus they sell to and market to many of these customers in similar ways. Efficiency of operation in sales and marketing spend are low hanging fruit, and easy consolidation which can be made.New sales people that were slotted to cover additional territories can now be shelved, and planned marketing spend can be shared. Some consolidation of development expense should also be possible. Other than this, consolidation of IT infrastructure, administrative expenses and customer support are all things which can be easily justified.Shareholders should feel some confidence in the entities attaining $60M in shared cost savings within a couple of years.While cost synergies are great, the bulk of the consolidation case is the ""revenue synergy"" component. $500M in new revenue creation is a massive number and almost represents what Teladoc did in 2019 full year revenue. Cross sale and solution co marketing makes a lot of sense given broadly the same base of customers.Teladoc Upsell into Livongo BaseLivongo and Teladoc each have a robust base of managed health insurers and self managed enterprises between them. Interestingly, there is only a 25% overlap across the customer base of both companies. This should mean there is ample opportunity to cross sell solutions into each others customers in a way that will offer less friction than either of the company’s having to ""break into"" unpenetrated accounts without preexisting relationships.This should greatly accelerate time to revenue and sales productivity providing both sales teams can be very quickly trained up on each company's solution. Sales compensation plans will need to be properly aligned to create the right behavioral incentives, but I believe they should be able to get them with time.The upsell of the Teladoc remote consultation to existing Livongo health insurers and self managed employers is a no brainer. Livongo already had in motion a partnership with Doctors on Demand and MD Live to do telemedicine consultations for behavioral health and diabetes medication management.For insurers and self managed employers, this provides a way to not only get their patients quick consultations in a convenient way for sudden issues that may come up, but also allows these businesses to take out cost from the system, with these cheaper, virtual consultations at ~$45 per remote visit, vs more than double for an in person visit.Having ease of scheduling and ease of access means that a patient is more likely to utilize a virtual consultation and not wait till they are in crisis or forced to go to Urgent Care, benefitting Teladoc's revenue, the overall patients health and lowering ultimate treatment cost for the insurance company or employer. The motion with this cross sell is clear, easily understood and likely to be effective. In fact, these regular check-in’s could even be prompted by the regular readings and data collection that the Livongo application collects providing another nudge or prompt for the Livongo user to schedule a telemedicine consultation with a Teledoc physician, creating a seamless revenue event for the new entity.Greater Insurance Acceptance & Higher ReimbursementFor Teladoc, having a chronic health management solution makes the case that much strong for health insurers to now provide coverage. Chronic disease is a very high cost to insurers, and health insurers will now have a greater business case justification to reimburse Teladoc usage, beyond just the lower cost of a periodic telemedicine consultation. Teladoc will now provide a means to actually lower overall cost of long term patient care.Source: Teladoc Investor Day, March 2020With such a fully featured platform that delivers remote urgent care, medical second opinions, nutrition management, mental health care and chronic health management, Teladoc also decreases the likelihood of any competitive remote management platform displacing it.In addition to greater coverage across more health plans, the combined Teladoc Livongo solution may also ultimately lead to a higher rate of insurance reimbursement to Teladoc, something that the company successfully has been able to achieve with each successive capability that it has added to the platform.More Frequent Member EngagementIn the analyst briefing call, Glen Tillman, Livongo Chairman suggested having the Teladoc network of doctors cross market the Livongo monitoring solution to their ~70M plus patients was another revenue synergy that made a lot of sense.The rationale for this is clear. Not only does this offer the allure of an immediate new source of revenue, but it solves one of the issues that Teladoc has struggled with which is rather low utilization and repeat engagement, which could slip post the pandemic if users look to return to live consultations with their doctors and relegate Teladoc to a ""back up"" service.Livongo's high daily engagement helps derisk Teladoc members abandoning telemedicine when the pandemic concludes. The Livongo solution provides Teladoc patients with a reason to have repeat consultations with their Teladoc doctors.The user base of Teladoc users with chronic health conditions is likely to be substantial. Livongo estimates 140M US adults with a chronic health condition, and 40% of those adults with more than 1 condition. Thus Teladoc gets itself a more engaged user base and a substantially large addressable base overnight.Source: Livongo Q1 2020 Investor ReportAlso, because these consultations are not for the assessment of new conditions but largely for periodic condition monitoring, discussion of variance in patient metrics and general counseling, these are the perfect type of visits to be done with a convenient remote solution, rather than requiring an in person visit.If there is any point of friction with this sales motion, it could be having a dependency on Teladoc doctors introducing new technology and systems for Livongo remote monitoring in a remote session.My concern here is that the effective reliance on uncompensated doctors as ""sales personnel"" to advocate for a new technology in an online consultation could be challenging. The post consultation follow up to get patients comfortable with the technology and familiar with provisioning and set up needs to be thought through, otherwise the anticipated revenue synergies here could be a lot less than expected.Acceleration of International GrowthTeladoc's international presence could provide Livongo with a meaningful boost to international ambitions. While Livongo is yet to go international, Teladoc is deployed in over 175 countries, and provides a fixed base and springboard for Livongo to very quickly boost generate revenue globally. Europe and the Asia Pacific in particular could provide meaningful opportunities for Livongo to very rapidly grow its business, and the merger with Teladoc provides a path to accelerate this.The merger of rapidly growing businesses is fraught with challenges including sales alignment, cultural fit and other operational execution. Teladoc and Livongo will have to be careful that they don't end up a victim to these things. Nevertheless, the justification for business alignment is solid. Livongo helps derisk Teladoc being regulated back to ""back up"" status at the conclusion of the pandemic. The value proposition of the combined entities gives health insurers and self managed employers a reason to not only cover but proactively push this platform to members. Teledoc and Livongo have a real opportunity to be the dominant digital health platform for the next decade."
4365912,25120,2020-08-07T14:47:25-04:00,"Teladoc is acquiring Livongo at a revenue multiple which is roughly twice its own valuation.The deal premium seems a bit rich, which explains a cautious reaction by investors of Teladoc, despite the promise of huge synergies down the road.I think the combination could be a winner in this market in the long run, and while a setback makes shares cheaper, I need further declines before seeing appeal.","Teladoc (TDOC) shook the investment community this past week as after a runaway period for the business and its shares, it is creating another boost for the operations as it is looking to merge with Livongo Health (LVGO).The deal makes perfect strategic sense, and while both companies have seen great operational and share price momentum, it was notably the run-up in Livongo which made its shares quite pricey. This has been recognized by investors in Teladoc who have some reserves to the deal, as after all they are paying for this high valuation.While an investment in this new powerhouse probably will pay off in the true long run given the great growth rates and rosy prospects, I am leaning cautious here after shares continue to trade at huge multiples, even after a recent near 20% setback and promise of huge synergies.Teladoc has reached an agreement with Livongo Health to merge operations, in which Teladoc will become the surviving party. Investors in Livongo are set to receive 0.592 shares of Teladoc for each share they own in Livongo, as well are eligible for an $11.33 per share cash payment.With shares of Teladoc trading around $250 ahead of the deal, that deal valued Livongo around $159 per share. As Livongo reported a diluted share count of 98 million shares by the end of the second quarter and actually holds quite some net cash, I peg the value at $15 billion, a little less than the $18.5 billion reported in the press release.The deal is driven by the desire to offer the full spectrum of medical services in a virtual care platform, as both companies are active in virtual care in their respective fields. While the combination is still quite small with pro-forma revenues of $1.3 billion this year, its 85% growth and $120 million in adjusted EBITDA are quite impressive, but moreover growth potential is what has driven the very strong momentum in the business and the shares in recent times.The companies really see the potential of a tie-up as synergies are set to become enormous, as the market is always a bit skeptical about such rosy projections, of course. Revenue synergies are set at $100 million by the end of the second year after closing and expected to rise to half a billion in 2025, equal to 40% of the current revenue base! This is driven by cross-selling opportunities as costs synergies of $60 million per annum by the end of the second quarter look quite compelling as well.The press release clearly states that investors in Livongo are set to own 42% of the company. By the end of the second quarter, Teladoc reported a share count of nearly 77 million, as the exchange ratio with Livongo suggests 98 million x 0.592 = 58 million shares issued to investors in Livongo, which is 43% of the total, good enough for me. This suggests that the combination will have 135 million shares outstanding, which based on the $250 pre-deal valuation gives the combination a massive $34 billion valuation as the small cash component to Livongo resulted in this really sort of 50/50 deal.The interesting nature is of course that both companies reported second-quarter results at or around the deal announcement, making it an easy comparison to see who has come around as a real winner.Teladoc reported second-quarter revenues of $241 million, an 85% increase compared to the year before as the company cut its operating losses by two-thirds to just around $7 million. Annualized, the company is on track to generate a billion in sales, as the equity was valued at $19 billion ahead of the deal announcement, translating into a 19 times sales multiple, although the company held a small net cash position.Livongo reported second-quarter revenues of $92 million, a 125% increase as the company has seen great operational momentum during the crisis, actually driven by Covid-19. The company managed to narrow the losses to essentially a break-even result. Livongo's shares traded at $145 ahead of the deal announcement which gave the company a $14 billion valuation, all the while sales stand at just $370 million on an annualised basis. This translates to a 38 times multiple, twice that of Teladoc.It is this huge valuation gap and its discrepancy therein which likely makes investors cautious with Livongo trading at twice the revenue multiple, as the deal seems a winner for investors in Livongo. That said, if synergies on both the cost and revenue side are realistic and will be realised in the years to come, it certainly looks like Teladoc will be the winner.Furthermore, it is good to differentiate what ""winner"" means in this respect as both companies will likely thrive, yet the question is if the same applies to shareholders after this success and recent performance which have been seen already. While Teladoc's performance this year has not been that bad (quite an understatement), the run from $20 to $150 for Livongo since March is what has truly been impressive. When covering the shares, and actually owning them earlier this year, I absolutely did not have the slightest idea that this merger with these price details might be in the works so soon after reviewing the shares.Shares of Teladoc have done really well and the business as well in recent years, but most of the time bolt-on deals and own valuations were seen around 10-15 times sales, while reporting largely similar growth rates, although at the time accompanied by some operating losses.The company is seeing operating leverage, but moreover Covid-19 might be the real breakthrough of the model, not just during pandemic circumstances yet also during regular conditions, as doctor appointments require travel, waits and physical meetings, although remote monitoring and telehealth is not meant for all complaints of course.The issue which I have is that while Teladoc has seen some real multiple inflation, with valuation multiples having risen to 19 times annualised sales ahead of the deal, the company is giving up nearly 50% of its own value to buy a peer which is actually trading at a multiple twice its own revenue multiple, at nearly 40 times sales. While there is no question that growth will likely continue for years and real synergies will be realised, a lot of good promise is paid for upfront.That being said, the share price reaction has de-risked the investment case to some extent with shares down from $250 to $210 at the moment. Right here, as more than $5 billion in value has gone up in smoke, the company is now valued at $28 billion, or about 20 times annualised sales. Furthermore, the promise of revenue synergies remains and losses might quickly turn into profits.Therefore, I am appealed to the negative reaction in combination with the sizable synergy estimates, but this only comes after the big premium paid for Livongo. Here and now, I have a neutral stance, yet have real interest to see developments from here as I would be keen to buy into the shares at a sales multiple of around 15 times based on the conditions."
4362717,22148,2020-07-31T00:00:45-04:00,"Teladoc Health completed a record quarter due to a surge in members and visits due to COVID-19.The company recently closed the InTouch Health deal, adding about $115 million in annual revenues.The stock trades for a very elevated multiple of nearly 15x 2021 sales guidance.The company has an elevated risk that 2021 visit levels don't repeat due to lower COVID-19 fears.","Teladoc Health (TDOC) has seen explosive growth due to COVID-19 fears, but the stock has seen more explosive upside in the process. My original bullish thesis on the virtual care provider turned more tepid as the market took the stock to irrational heights. Not only is the stock outrageously expensive for the current virus fears and already limited organic growth, but Teladoc Health also faces the risk of virus fears disappearing. The stock has very elevated risk, up near $225.Image Source: Teladoc Health websiteTeladoc Health reported a remarkable quarter by all metrics but the bottom line. The company generated 85% revenue growth to reach $241.0 million in the quarter and saw total visits surge by 203% to 2.8 million.The disconnect between visit growth and revenue growth is where the investment thesis in the stock struggles. Teladoc saw revenue per visit collapse to less than $86, down from $143 in the prior Q2.The company saw utilization surge to 16.0% of members, up 690 basis points from 9.1% last Q2. Despite all these positives, it only saw the EPS loss improve slightly to $0.34 from $0.41 last year.The Q3 guidance has the revenue per visit rising back to $108, while still forecasting a large loss. The company sees the virtual care provider still generating losses of up to $0.35 per share during a period of peak demand.Teladoc Health is wise to continue investing aggressively in a business only set to top $1 billion in annual revenues in 2021. The concern here is that a potential one-time visit surge doesn't provide any real financial benefit whether immediately or lasting, especially when the annual loss is targeted at $1.45 per share.The biggest problem is that the cost of revenues surged with the additional visits. Teladoc Health spent $90.8 million on costs of sales during Q2, up from $72.4 million in the prior quarter. Also, the number grew far faster than revenue growth at 118% YoY, with costs down at only $41.6 million last Q2.Source: Teladoc Health Q2'20 earnings releaseEven the need for Teladoc Health to nearly double advertising and marketing from last year is concerning. The virtual care service apparently has real competition, with the company having to spend nearly 20% of revenues during the quarter, or $47.6 million, to acquire new members.The operating loss was substantially better compared to last Q2 at only a $7.2 million loss, but the higher interest expense due to acquisitions doesn't add any value here. Scaling sales at the cost of higher debt isn't beneficial to shareholders when the company doesn't have positive cash flows to repay debt.The initial Q3 and 2020 revenue guidance probably provides some unwarranted excitement. Teladoc Health closed the InTouch Health deal on July 1st. The deal is expected to add $63 million in 2020 revenues.Source: Teladoc Health Q2'20 earnings releaseAssuming the InTouch Health deal adds $31.5 million in revenues per quarter, the Q3 guidance isn't actually overly impressive. Teladoc Health guided towards a revenue total of $280 million, suggesting actual organic revenue below $250 million.Even the guidance for 2021 revenue growth in the range of 30-40% is concerning considering the benefit from InTouch Health. The 1H revenues weren't included in 2020 numbers, so those additional revenues of around $65 million based on 30% growth on a $50 million base in 2020 aren't included in the guidance and would add about 6.5 percentage points to the growth rates. The actual organic revenue growth rate might not tick above 25% next year despite claims that utilization stabilized at 40% above pre-COVID-19 levels.Investors need to remember, the risk to the story from a reduction in the COVID-19 fears could drive 2021 visits down from elevated 2020 levels. A vaccine or just natural burnout of a coronavirus could eliminate the elevated risks driving people to utilize virtual care visits. At best, the company might be lucky to match 2020 visits levels.The stock is just far too richly valued now, with a market cap approaching $20 billion following the addition of InTouch Health shares. The company is technically paying over $1.1 billion for the acquisition, considering the 4.6 million shares offered when the stock was far lower along with $150 million in cash. The stock has 83.4 million shares listed as outstanding for Q3, leading to a market value of $18.8 billion with 2021 sales estimates in the $1.3 billion range.The key investor takeaway is that Teladoc Health had another breakout quarter. The company has now seen virtual care become a standard care option, but investors are paying far too much for the stock here.Teladoc Health trades for nearly 15x 2021 sales guidance, while the company risks sales not hitting targets if the COVID-19 fears disappear next year."
4366285,100666,2020-08-08T07:13:31-04:00,"Livongo and Teladoc announced their merger earlier this week and that creates mixed feelings.This merger really makes sense from a business point of view, and the new company could be the trailblazer of a new form of healthcare.Everybody wins in this deal: patients, doctors, and the healthcare budget.There are several reasons why the stock prices of both companies have fallen so much.I want to have a position in this new company. The best way to do that as of now is buying Livongo shares, which trade about 5% lower than Teladoc.","The news came as a big surprise this past week: Teledoc (TDOC) and Livongo (LVGO) have made an agreement to merge.As Livongo was a Potential Multibagger pick in December 2019, I am a shareholder of Livongo, just as many of my subscribers. Many have mixed feelings about this merger, but the same goes for Teladoc shareholders, especially after the big plunge. There are also a few practical questions. This article tells you more.Maybe it's the first buy-out or merger for some of you, and it always creates mixed feelings. Even when you get more experienced, those feelings don't go away.In the first place, there's disappointment about the deal because you liked the company that you owned. It may sound strange, but that is the feeling you should have. It means it was the stock of a great company.The only other feeling you can have in a merger or acquisition is one of relief, and that's of course not what you want. It means that you didn't believe in the company anymore or maybe never had, but stumbled into the investment in one way or the other. So, don't worry about the mixed feelings. You should have them. I have them.The returns of Livongo since I picked it as a Potential Multibagger on December 26, 2019, have been stellar. Even after the big drops this week, the stock is still up 386% since I picked it. This adds to the feeling that a much-beloved stock is taken out of my hands. Even if you had smaller gains, this stock had been on fire for a while, so you'll probably have the same feeling.Of course, as shareholders of Livongo or Teladoc, we could vote against the merger, but both companies have agreed on this, and it will be impossible and make no sense to stop it. If both management teams are set on it, a no-vote doesn't make sense. The question is now what we should think about the new combination. But before we do that, let's first check out the deal.Teledoc and Livongo announced the news of the merger on Wednesday, August 5, before the market opened.The agreement that Livongo and Teladoc approved of consists of a stock and cash deal. Livongo shareholders get 0.592 shares of Teladoc and $11.33 in cash. Based on the price of Teladoc right now (Friday, after the market closed), that represents a value of (193.72x0.592)+11.33= $126.01 per share of Livongo. A few days ago, this was still a lot higher because the market punished both stocks for the deal:Data by YChartsWhen the merger completes, and that will normally be near the end of Q4, existing Teladoc Health shareholders will own approximately 58% of the combined company and current Livongo shareholders about 42%.This may be simple for more experienced investors, and they can skip this, but for relatively new investors, this may be the first merger or acquisition and that's why I want to go over the details.Suppose you own 100 shares of Livongo, what will be the consequence then? Well, you could, of course, sell your shares, as both companies stay tradeable on the stock exchange and can be bought and sold.If you hold the 100 shares, you'll get 59.2 shares of Teladoc shares for your Livongo shares. Your broker does this automatically when the merger completes.If your broker doesn't handle fractional shares, you'll get 59 shares and 20% in cash extra of 1 Teladoc share. That would be about $38.74 at the current price of $193.72.But on top of the shares (and maybe the small amount of cash of a fractional share), you also get cash in your brokerage account. Each Livongo share is 0.592 shares of Teladoc + $11.33 in cash, so for your 100 shares, you also get $1,133.Teladoc is the clear leader globally in telehealth, and Livongo is the leader in what it calls Applied Health Signals, supported by AI and ML (artificial intelligence and machine learning).In their merger announcement, Teladoc and Livongo wrote:This is of course typical corporate talk. But there's a lot of truth in it for this merger.Indeed, I think the two are complementary, and they will make a stronger company together if they can successfully merge the two companies, not just from a financial and infrastructural point of view, but also especially from a corporate culture standpoint. That's sometimes overlooked. Zane Burke, Livongo's CEO, has a 100% rating on Glassdoor, based on 22 reviews. That's quite amazing.Jason Gorevic, the current CEO of Teladoc and the CEO of the new combination, has also quite a good score on Glassdoor, though:Teladoc has a history of acquisitions and the general consensus is that they handled these very well. So that's a good omen.Besides that, this is announced as a merger, and although it looks a lot like the acquisition of Livongo by Teladoc, phrasing does play a role in such cases. This is not the big corporate whale swallowing the little fish. This is more a fusion of equals.The merger makes a lot of sense because both companies, but especially Livongo, were seen by some industry insiders as take-out plays for bigger companies. Think mainly of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), which have claimed several times that they are interested and working on eHealth.Together, Teladoc and Livongo can join forces to fight the bigger names if, or probably more when, they come to this market.For Apple and Google, for example, it would be very hard to create a network of doctors such as that of Teladoc. Livongo also had a network of personal coaches, but that was may be a bit easier to copy than the deep relation of Teledoc and doctors. And the combination of the two, that's really interesting. I'll come back to this.Speed also matters when you try to grab market share in an emerging market. Together the two can be the trailblazer for new healthcare and take as much market share as fast as possible.For Livongo, it's clear that it makes its direct market much bigger. Until now, Livongo was only available in the US, while Teladoc is already present in 175 countries worldwide. I think it's easy to see that there are huge synergies there. Instead of rolling out a sales team worldwide on its own, now Livongo can just leverage Teladoc's network.And it's also true what the companies state in their slide show:I really believe the merger represents the beginning of a new era of healthcare. This newly-formed platform has advantages for all parties: patients are empowered, doctors are helped by computers to take away the stress of having to see a new patient every five minutes and have more accurate data, healthcare spending could finally stop growing like weeds.For the patient, a whole trajectory is possible within a telehealth universe. This is the example that is given by the companies, in this case about Claire who has hypertension:This makes a lot of sense. The individual patient is empowered to take action, is followed closely and has several options. Instead of checking the patient's health condition once every month, every quarter, every year, Livongo makes that Claire's hypertension is constantly monitored. She's given nudges several times a day for healthy habits and tips about diet and exercise. If she wants, she can have the assistance of a professional coach on Livongo's network.From the point of view of data, which I find the most interesting part for Livongo, a new dimension is created. Livongo doesn't only have the process, but it also gets the extra data from blood tests and other tests from Teladoc, which can be implemented in the system.If a certain person is hospitalized, Livongo's AI can see what preceded the hospitalization and later it could suggest going to the hospital before an acute situation occurs. It could detect long-term trends, revealing correlations that we hadn't seen before.This is the next generation of healthcare. I have already mentioned Hemant Taneja's book Unscaled in my previous article about Livongo. Taneja argues that unscaling, bringing products to the level of the individual, is the new trend, and it will be at the heart of the evolution of the 21st century.(Source)The way to unscale things, to humanize them again, is, maybe paradoxically enough, by artificial intelligence or AI. That's Livongo's strength. Mass production and being treated in an impersonal way has become a huge disadvantage to companies.We all don't want to be just the next patient. We want to be really listened to, we want to have the data that matter, we want the best for our health and that of our loved ones. A system that breeds so much frustration as the current healthcare system is ripe for innovation.AI can make patients' lives better by recognizing patterns, giving advice electronically or by phone. With this merger of Livongo and Teladoc, this vision comes closer to reality. Or as it reads in the merger announcement:In this system, health coaches will probably get an important role. They will become the first-line help for a lot of costumers, together with nurses. That will relieve doctors of a whole range of tasks that are not their core tasks.Health coaches can become the first triage for doctors. If trends in data indicate that the condition of a patient with hypertension or diabetes or any other chronic condition deteriorates, health coaches can alarm a patient and make an appointment with a doctor immediately. In the same way, a patient can do that much easier now. And for doctors, having the full-range data will make their work much more efficient and probably much more accurate.In that way, there will be much more focus on prevention, which saves lives and money. If you are on the verge of a chronic condition or you are living with it, this integrated company will make sure that you see how your condition is at any time. You have the data, and in case it's needed, the doctor is there too. Now there's often just a check every now and then. Sometimes it's already too late and the patient already has damage because of an unnoticed progression of a disease.As you probably can tell, I'm enthusiastic about the future of this new, integrated company, which looks a lot like the future of healthcare to me. It will take time to fully realize the vision that I have laid out here, but time and a vision go a long way together, much further than many people can imagine.The combined company will have an expected 2020 pro forma revenue of approximately $1.3B, up 85% versus 2019. The adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of the combined company is expected to be $120M for 2020.The companies estimate that there will be about $100M in revenue synergies in the first two years after the close and that this will grow to $500M by 2025. The main drivers are Livongo's international expansion, improved member retention, and more sales efficiency. New care models and next-generation solutions could give more upside later, which is not quantified yet.The combined company is expected to keep growing at a high pace for the upcoming years:As you can see, the newly created company is expected to grow 30% to 40% from 2020 to 2023, not taking the synergies into account. That's still great growth in my book, and if this is sustainable, which I think it could be, this newly formed company could have sustainable high growth for a long time.Since the announcement, both Teladoc's and Livongo's stock prices have fallen a lot: Teladoc 22%, Livongo 16%. Why is this? There are several reasons.1. DisappointmentAs I wrote before, it's completely normal that if you are a Teladoc or Livongo shareholder, you're disappointed, not because the merger doesn't make sense from a business point of view, but because you feel that your great stock that has brought you big gains is taken away from you. That creates selling pressure.A second reason is that momentum traders will dump both stocks now. This year, Teladoc grew 85% in Q2, but that was an outlier spurred by the pandemic. Livongo has been called a COVID-19 play too, but investors who claim that haven't paid attention.One of the reasons that I picked Livongo in December 2019 was because of its triple-digit revenue growth (at the moment 137% pre-corona). If this special stock is taken away from you, you're disappointed and you end up selling.Besides that, a lot of traders and investors will want to take profits of the table because they are worried about the deal. After all, both stocks had done outstandingly. This is the return since the beginning of the year until before the merger announcement:Data by YChartsTeladoc shareholders probably think that their company overpaid for Livongo, which some call a fad. I don't agree at all, and I think that those should study the company with an open mind, but it doesn't matter, perception also is a form for reality for someone.Livongo shareholders think that Livongo was sold too cheaply. Their growth darling only got a premium of 10% from the closing price of the day before. In my experience, if both parties after a negotiation are not happy with the compromise, the compromise is good. I think the same goes for shareholders.I think the merger makes a lot of sense from a business point of view, and this new company could really be the trailblazer for a much-needed revolution in healthcare. There's a huge upside for years to come here. As a long-term investor, I look at these secular trends and see a company that is poised to succeed. That's why I absolutely want to have this company in my portfolio.If you want more exposure to this new company, it mostly makes most sense to buy the acquirer because the acquisition target often trades at a premium versus where it was before. But in this case, Livongo also fell.At the price that Teladoc trades at now ($193.72) and Livongo ($120.88), which one to buy? Well, 0.592 times $193.72 = 114.68 + $11.33, that makes $126.01. Livongo now trades at $120.88, which means that Livongo's shares are actually cheaper at this point than Teladoc's.Am I sad about the merger? Yes. A great stock that has performed so well will be taken from my portfolio, and that always feels bad. But in this case, the merger company really excites me, and it could be the trailblazer for a new era of healthcare. I want to be part of that movement, so I want to own the combined company.In the meantime, keep growing!"

Source: TradingViewTeladoc's (TDOC) announcement that it will be raising $850m via a convertible debt offering depressed the company's share price, which had hit a peak of $195 at the end of April. The stock is already back on the upswing however, jumping 8% to reach $175 at the close of trading last week.Teladoc's share price has made substantial gains during the coronavirus pandemic as telemedicine services have found themselves in the spotlight.Various groups - including the government's COVID-19 task force and Centers for Disease Control (""CDC""), have pointed to the emerging industry as a means of providing necessary healthcare during the lockdown period, whilst analysts including Cantor Fitzgerald and Piper Sandler have raised their price targets for Teladoc, citing high recent usage growth rates and the possibility of growth being sustained post-lockdown.Teladoc occupies a leading position within the telehealth industry being one of the few services to have IPO'd (in mid-2015), and having regularly issued convertible notes ($643m by the end of Q120, now>$1.4bn) to fund the development of its platform and make numerous acquisitions of smaller rivals, which has added to its reputation as the company to watch in this space.Although there may be question marks about how popular platforms like Teladoc are with individual users (the company makes roughly three quarters of its revenues via subscriptions access fees and 25% from visit fees), since this is an issue common to all telemedicine providers and so long as subscribed members get the service they desire when using the platform, I believe the strong growth that Teladoc has experienced over the past year, which has spiked during the pandemic, ought to continue, and increase substantially over the medium-to-long term.As such, I remain bullish on Teladoc stock. The consensus 1-year price target for Teladoc's share price is $175 with a high of $212 and low of $135. I believe that if the company executes on its bullish earnings forecasts for the remainder of 2020, the stock will break the $200 barrier in the coming months. In the rest of this article I will examine the company in more detail and try to provide a longer-term fair value price target.Through Teladoc Health's platform its members can remotely access affordable and on-demand healthcare via a network of physicians and healthcare professionals who have signed up to the service to provide remote services in exchange for a meaningful income stream and fewer administrative hurdles.Teladoc's Global, multichannel distribution model.

The company has signed up clients including 50+ health plan providers - UnitedHealth (UNH) and Blue Shield of California amongst them - 70+ insurance and financial services firms (AIG, AXA Global), and 300+ hospitals and health systems, including Jefferson Partners Healthcare. The company also operates a direct-to-consumer (""DTC"") channel, through which it has a partnership in place with CVS Healthcare, as well as a mental health offering, via its 2015 acquisition of Better Help. In total, Teladoc has 5 consumer-facing brands: Teladoc, Advance Medical, Best Doctors, BetterHelp and HealthiestYou which cater for almost all forms of healthcare, from managing chronic diseases to providing healthcare coaching, therapy and health diagnostics.Via its technologically advanced and scalable platform the company utilizes a variety of data capture, API, and digital monitoring techniques to optimize its services and evaluate the quality of services provided by its network of independent and commercial healthcare providers. Teladoc recent track record. Source: Teladoc Health Investor Day presentation.As we can see in the slide above, Teladoc can point to growth in most of its fundamentals since the company joined the Nasdaq in June 2015, raising ~$157m from its IPO by selling 8.3m shares at a price of $19.During Q120 the company reported that it had completed 2m visits compared to 4.1m visits in the whole of 2019, and that paid membership had increased to 43m as at March 31 - an increase of 6.2m members (new registrations increased 125% year-on-year). Total revenues also increased by 41% year-on-year to a record $181m (subscription access fees were $107.9m, and visit fees $43.7m - 93% year-on-year), buoyed by high demand from existing customers owing to COVID-19, and a spike in requests from new potential clients.Overall, the company reported a net loss of $29.6m (EPS of $0.4) in Q120. Its operating costs increased to $129.4m but OPEX as a percentage of revenues decreased substantially to 72% compared to 83% in Q119 - an encouraging sign that indicates Teladoc's business model is working, and that its platform is scalable. As a result of the growing demand for its services, Teladoc has upgraded its forward guidance for 2020 from revenues of $695m - $710m, to $800 - $825m - which represents ~45-49% annual growth.Teladoc goals and achievements since IPO. Source: Teladoc Health Investor Day presentation.The company's lengthy and comprehensive recent analyst day presentation, outlines a broad range of growth strategies whereby Teladoc takes advantage of its market-leading position, global network of more than 50,000 physicians, partnerships, sales force and technology in order to position itself as the world's first multi-billion dollar telemedicine provider.Thanks to its extensive data-capture technology Teladoc is developing a better understanding of its clients and individual users' needs, using the types of customer-profiling techniques pioneered by major social media platforms such as the GAFA firms: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). All 4 of these giants have tried, and mostly failed to penetrate the virtual health market, suggesting that the barriers-to-entry are high, and that specialist expertise is required, making Teladoc's emergence as the no. 1 player even more remarkable.Although management are relatively young and inexperienced, with minimal blue-chip healthcare experience, the company's Board includes US Senator and early-stage healthcare investor William H. Frist, Washington health benefits and policy advisor Helen Darling, and, on the commercial side, Michael Goldstein, the retired Chairman and CEO of Toys R Us. The experience of all 3 has doubtless helped Teladoc secure commercial partnerships with major healthcare players such as CVS (CVS) and UnitedHealth, as well as earning praise (and reimbursement deals) from the government.Teladoc targets ""white space"" to increase TAM: Source Teladoc Health Investor Day presentation.Teladoc recognizes a short-term growth market of 73m users based on its existing clients. The company will look to engage individual users by providing exceptional service and learning about each customer during their first visit in order to heighten the possibility of recurring visits going forward.Clearly, however, besides the low-hanging fruit, there is a vast targetable addressable market (""TAM"") of 190m users in the US, and 1.1bn worldwide, management estimates. I believe Teladoc's international growth strategy will mirror that of another tech giant, Uber (NYSE:UBER), since the companies' operate a broadly similar business model which involves using a technology platform to connect those in need with people who can help them at short notice. In Uber's case it is people in need of a ride, in Teladoc's, it is people in need of healthcare.By establishing ""beachheads"" with leading services in new markets (and bringing acquisitions into play) and pursuing a ""land and expand"" strategy, leveraging its robust technologies, Teladoc expects to establish a global business and platform which will then be used to expand their product and service offering. The recent acquisition of Paris-based MedecinDirect (for $11m in April 2109), is an early example of this strategy.Teladoc. Current revenue (in thousands) split US vs. International. Source: my table using data from 2019 10K submission.As we can see above, there is still a long way to go, but international subscription has been reasonably impressive to date, and has the potential to grow exponentially, I believe, alongside paid visits.In terms of competition, there are many companies pursuing a very similar business model to Teladoc. These include MD Live, Doctor on Demand, Babylon Health and a host of other smaller players. Teladoc competitors. Source: Owler.comTeladoc is currently the dominant player by a considerable margin, with 3x more funding, >1,500 more employees and 10x the revenues of its nearest competitor, MD Live.Although technology platforms have the ability to scale rapidly and realize massive investment from venture capital or big business backers, it is tempting to wonder if most of the companies above would not prefer to be acquired by Teladoc, to competing directly against the company, given its huge competitive advantage.Teladoc is a very widely-covered stock and therefore it is doubtful that there are many surprises in store for the market. However, analysts will be watching closely to see how the company performs in the second quarter of this year.CFO Mala Murthy told analysts on the Q120 earnings call that the company expects to see revenues of $215m - $225m in Q220 - 65% - 73% year-on-year growth - with 6-7m members added primarily from Medicaid. Additionally, the company is expecting to temporarily add visit-fee only access to 2-3m extra users during Q2. If the company beats on revenue and earnings (expected to be -$0.28 - -$0.23), then we can expect to see Teladoc's share price make significant gains.The next catalyst to look out for will be the company's full-year performance since this ought to prove whether the gains made and growth achieved during the coronavirus pandemic are sustainable, or whether interest declines as people's lives returns to normal and they revert to more traditional forms of healthcare. The company is hoping to end the year with >50m members and having completed 8m - 9m total visits. It is likely that under-performance will be punished heavily by the market, if a post-pandemic lull is confirmed.It will also be worth keeping an eye on the company's per-member, per month (""PMPM"") figure - a key metric that indicates how much members are using the platform. This figure declined from $1.03 in Q119 to $0.83 in Q120, which the company put down to its on-boarding large numbers of members from some of its subscription contract wins. Finally, news on reimbursement wins - or lack of them - are likely to affect the share price, as I believe securing reimbursement is a critical aspect of the US growth strategy.There are a number of risks associated with an investment in Teladoc. After a period of sustained price growth, which included a ""black swan"" event (the pandemic) which contributed to unexpectedly strong growth, there is a realistic possibility that the company will not be able to sustain its current performance, and that its share price will slide as a result.Additionally, Teladoc - being an expansionist company - is likely to continue to borrow substantially from different sources - witness the most recent $850m convertible note offering, with the effects of the investment not being felt for a significant period, or, in a worst case scenario, not at all.A failure in overseas markets, for example, or negative media coverage, could result in the company not only losing customers, but also being unable to meet its debt obligations.One of Teladoc's competitors could grow at a significantly faster rate than the company and overtake it, or launch an IPO that wrestles the market's attention and goodwill away from Teladoc. Teladoc is competing for the services of the best physicians against these companies, and a rival may gain a reputation for excellent service whilst Teladoc may suffer the opposite fate.Additionally, signs of a lack of usage amongst subscribed members may persuade companies to remove Teladoc from its health plans, or not to renew their subscriptions, since the use-case will no longer be valid.Risks notwithstanding, there are several reasons why I believe Teladoc will continue to grow and its share price will increase.I believe Teladoc management are doing a good job growing the company on a micro-level - working hard to secure small wins such as new contracts, reimbursement wins and new products and services, whilst also addressing growth at a macro level, compiling a global growth strategy and making numerous deals with the blue-chip healthcare concerns (e.g. CVS), insurers and overseas companies that can help it to grow into the multi-billion revenue generating company it wants to be.I think one of the advantages that Teladoc has over the company I have frequently compared it to - Uber - is that it is doing all of its growing post-IPO, rather than privately. That means there are fewer surprises and unknowns for the market to have to digest, and allows the share price to spike on good news and increased revenues, as well as creating goodwill and the image that the company is ""doing it by the book"".I am also impressed by the company's powerful board and the huge competitive advantage it enjoys over all of its rivals at this time. Telemedicine is not a small market - estimated to be $41.4bn in 2019 and growing at a CAGR of 15.1%.As such I believe investors ought to be looking at a growth scenario that sees Teladoc capturing as much as 20% of this market by 2025, and earning revenues >$12bn. Clearly, OPEX will concurrently increase during this period, but technology platforms are highly scalable, hence whilst I can see revenues growing at triple-figure rates between 2021 - 2024 and then tapering back towards 2020's estimated 47%, I believe OPEX may only increase at a rate of 50% per annum, resulting in 2025 OPEX of ~$6bn.Based on my assumptions and financial model (which Haggerston BioHealth subscribers have unrestricted access to via my model portfolio), I believe that Teladoc can surpass analysts' expectations going forward and that its growth could surprise the market, despite how keenly it watches the company.I believe Teladoc shares could warrant a price of $400 within 18-24 months if the growth strategy is executed to perfection, and provided industry tailwinds remain favorable. Shorter term, as mentioned in my intro, I think the stock can break the important psychological barrier of $200 in 2020.Although I have compared Teladoc with Uber in this article perhaps I ought to have used Zoom (ZM) as my model. Zoom has performed admirably for shareholders since its IPO, with its shares gaining 182%, whilst Uber's shares have declined in value by 10%. The ""Wild West"" nature of Uber's story and growth has not done the share price any favors, and although Facebook's platform is often controversial, the value proposition is far clearer.I believe, since much of Teladoc's business relies upon subscription revenues from major blue-chip clients, it is less likely to experience some of the problems Uber has faced such as backlash from authorities, unhappy ""employees"", and troubles at the top.I also believe that Teladoc is reaching a size and scale where it can push back against short-sellers (who claim, for example that management artificially inflate user numbers or PMPM figures) and start to point to more serious revenue generation and confirmation that its business model works. If the company does get dragged back down that slippery slope and has to scramble for evidence that it is trying to solve a problem that doesn't need solving, then it could be disastrous for the share price.I am confident that the company has passed that inflection point however and that we may witness some seriously impressive growth in the coming months and years. Shareholders shouldn't panic if the company continues to raise funds regularly, even if they are diluted. Patient investors could realize triple-digit gains if things fall into place for the company. In the telemedicine space, Teladoc is the 800 pound gorilla, and likely, in my view, is first multi-billion dollar revenue-earning company."

Yes, Teladoc's business has seen increased demand as a result of the spread of COVID-19 but let's also remember that the impressive growth profile was already in place well before the outbreak (although not as impressive as today).I believe that the stock still has room to run, especially if you are willing (and able) to hold on to shares for the next few years. This current market darling has a bullish long-term story to tell - and Teladoc's recently reported results (and management commentary) prove it.Image SourceOn April 29, 2020, Teladoc reported Q1 2020 results that missed on the bottom-line but were in line with analyst's top-line estimates. The company reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.40 (missed by $0.04) on revenue of $180.8mm.Source: Q1 2020 Earnings SlidesThe strong revenue growth was impressive, but it was the operating metrics that stood out the most.Source: Q1 2020 Earnings SlidesAs shown, Teladoc exceeded over 2mm total visits over the first 3 months of 2020, which was a new milestone for the company. Additionally, management mentioned during the conference call that the company onboarded over 6mm new paid members in the U.S. and they anticipate having other 6mm-7mm members in Q2 2020. Moreover, new registrations increased 125% YoY and outpaced member growth for the quarter, which is meaningful from a long-term growth/engagement perspective.It also helps the bull case that management provided strong guidance for the remainder of 2020:Simply put, there is a lot to like about these figures, and I believe that the story is just beginning because, in my opinion, telehealth is quickly becoming the new normal. As such, I believe that growth is here to stay.In a previous article, I described Teladoc's massive potential market opportunity and touched on the fact that the company already had a proven track record before the COVID-19 pandemic flipped the world upside down.Source: Investor Presentation, 3/11/2020The biggest pushback that I get in regards to Teladoc's promising long-term business prospects is the tough competitive landscape and the company's lack of having a competitive advantage (i.e., a moat). I, however, believe that telehealth will be the new-norm, so there will be room for many players - but it should be noted that Teladoc is already a clear leader in the space, which is extremely bullish.To this point, the telemedicine market is projected to reach $185B by 2026 according to a recent report by Fortune Business Insights. The estimate factors in the surge in adoption of telehealth services as a direct result of the COVID-19 outbreak.I believed that telehealth was the future long before the current pandemic (see this article from early-2018) and I completely agree with the current thought that COVID-19 is pushing more people to adopt this form of healthcare (with adoption meaning that people's future consumption will change for good). Simply put, Teladoc is a disruptive company that has a business that will likely continue to catch steam as we move through 2020 and beyond. Telemedicine is the future, in my opinion, and Teladoc may be one of the best bets in this growth industry. The growth is here to stay, in my opinion.Teladoc Health's stock is overvalued according to estimates at Morningstar.Source: MorningstarThere is no denying the fact that Teladoc is richly valued at current levels. However, I still do not believe that all of the company's growth potential is not factored into the stock. In my opinion, TDOC shares will more than grow into its current valuation through 2020/2021.Investing in small-cap companies comes with many risks, but the major risk for Teladoc is related to the company being outspent by larger competitors. Additionally, the company relies heavily on its partnerships to expand its business, so deteriorating relationships in the industry could have a material impact on Teladoc's business.In addition, integration risk needs to be considered given the numerous acquisitions that have been made over the last few years. And most importantly, regulatory changes have the potential to greatly impact Teladoc's business. Please also refer to Teladoc's 2019 10-K for additional risk factors that should be considered before investing in the company.There is a lot to like about Teladoc Health, and I believe that the company's Q1 2020 results (and guidance) show that the long-term story remains intact. Long-term investors will be richly rewarded if the company's story plays out like I believe that it will. Teladoc has consistently reported strong growth metrics, which makes me believe that this company still has promising long-term business prospects. It helps the bull case that the market also seems to be on the same page (notice the impressive YTD performance of the stock).Additionally, the company recently pricing its $850mm convertible notes should be viewed as a positive development. Teladoc, like other companies, is taking advantage of the market to raise capital in this tough environment. I believe that this additional near-term liquidity will provide management with some flexibility and could eventually be used to add promising assets to an already impressive portfolio of businesses. Remember, it was not long ago that Teladoc was touted for its impressive track record of making small tuck-in acquisitions.In my mind, Teladoc will either grow into a significant disruptive company in the healthcare industry or it will get acquired by a larger player. Either way, it is a win-win situation for investors. In my opinion, the risk for Teladoc's stock is to the upside if you are in it for the long haul.Disclosure: I am/we are long TDOC.

The company has agreed to pay a massive $18.5 billion for the leading platform to monitor chronic conditions using their inflated currency. My negative investment thesis is further reinforced by the outrageous valuation of this acquisition.Source: Teladoc Health websiteThe company agreed to pay $18.5 billion for Livongo Health on the day the company reported quarterly revenues of only $91.9 million to create a so-called leader in consumer-centered virtual care. Yes, revenues grew 125% YoY, but the company remains relatively small for the valuation paid in this deal.For the YTD period, Livongo is still up over 400% even following the 7% decline following the deal news. The stock traded as low as $15 last October and Teladoc decided to buy the stock for a valuation of nearly $159 per share including $550 million in convertible debt.Data by YChartsThe deal involves Teladoc paying Livongo shareholders 0.592 shares of Teladoc Health plus $11.33 per share in cash. With Teladoc trading around $220, each Livongo share is worth $141.57 or only a few dollars above where the stock trades now suggesting limited priced in risk to the deal closing.The combined company forecasts sales reaching $1.3 billion this year on 85% growth. The adjusted EBITDA target for 2020 is $120 million.A lot of the promise of the platform is from expectations for driving revenue synergies of $100 million by the second year following the close which would be roughly 2022. In addition, the new entity forecasts $500 million in cross-selling upside by 2025 which is the fifth year after the deal closes assuming a Q4 closing. The absurd mention of $60 million in cost synergies highlights the market's disconnect here.Source: Teladoc Health merger presentationTo get a full view of where the new entity projected sales could go in the next few years, let's look at the combined analyst estimates for the new company.Teladoc Health revenue targets:Livongo Health revenue targets:Combined entity revenue targets:Even giving Teladoc Health credit from some sizable revenue synergies, the combined company only gets to 2023 revenues of ~$3.5 billion. The company would need 40% revenue growth on a nearly $2.6 billion revenue base in 2022 to reach this target. The stock already trades at 10x aggressive revenue growth targets for over 3 years out.The company will have the following EV multiples based on the more current 2021 and 2022 revenue targets. The stock trades at ~18x 2021 revenues of $1.9 billion and nearly 14x 2022 revenues of $2.5 billion after factoring in a net cash balance following the payment of $1.3 billion in cash to Livongo shareholders.In addition, the market has already assumed substantial growth in virtual health care that the risk of a COVID-19 vaccine or treatment isn't factored into the story. My previous research has already highlighted how reduced virus fears could leave the company with flat patient visits next year as the 200% growth in visits in Q2 is absorbed without a crisis next year.The key investor takeaway is that Teladoc Health top-ticked the market to pay a premium price for Livongo Health with their elevated stock currency. At a best-case scenario where virus fears continue to drive substantial growth, the new entity trades at 18x 2021 EV/S targets. In a worst-case scenario, a COVID-19 vaccine or treatment leads to reduced virtual care demand in 2021 crushing the stock. Investors should avoid Teladoc Health and Livongo Health until more reasonable valuations exist and reduced virus fears normalize demand."

The telemedicine company has seen a massive increase in demand, but a large portion of the growth is temporary in nature due to the general flu season. My investment thesis remains bearish on the stock here at $165 with the risks far outweighing the benefits to the business.Image Source: Teladoc Health websiteFor Q1, Teladoc reported a very impressive surge in medical visits. The company had originally guided towards visits of only 1.5 million in the quarter, and it actually reached 2.0 million visits in the quarter.The 33% outperformance due to the coronavirus fears weren't as impressive as the new guidance for 2.3 million to 2.4 million visits in Q2. The big question is whether these visit levels are sustainable in the short term and the ultimate impact of seasonal dips as the flu-like illness fades during the hotter summer months.Teladoc guided towards 8 million to 9 million visits for the year, up from the original guidance of 5.5 million to 5.9 million. The 2020 total visits are up 2.5 million to 3.1 million from the previous estimates with a 0.5 million boost in Q1 and up to 1.0 million in Q2.The key here is the guidance for the majority of the boost in the 1H of the year. Even if the 2H sees a similar boost in medical visits, the total visits per quarter will be down from the Q2 peak.As mentioned on the Q1 earnings call, CEO Jason Gorevic sees some of the benefits of temporary members waning after the current quarter:The biggest question is whether visits in the 2H settle at permanently higher levels of visits. In the past, visits have peaked in Q1 and declined throughout the summer months as the typical seasonal flow reduces usage. The quarterly visits for 2019 and 2018 by quarter are as follows:Typically, Teladoc sees a big sequential dip during Q2 with a boost during Q3 and a jump during Q4 to a peak in Q1. As COVID-19 fears wane, the risk is that the company misses the aggressive Q2 target of over 2.3 million visits. Either way, Q3 visits will most definitely dip from the elevated Q2 levels and the telemedicine expert will find it very difficult to replicate these visit levels next year.The other side of the equation is the profit picture. In Q1, Teladoc had to pay additional fees to add licensed physicians into their network. The 92% surge in visits was only matched with 41% revenue growth.Seen another way, Teladoc guided to visit growth in the year of nearly 50% above original estimates while only hiking revenues by $110 million, or ~15%. The benefit of the surge in demand is not really accrued to the business.The company had originally guided to adjusted EBITDA for the year of $65 million and the new guidance is only a bump of $10 million to $75 million. Teladoc forecasts up to 5 million additional members at year end, but those totals are only adding ~$1 per month, hence the relatively small revenue boost.Revenues don't rise as much as the majority of revenues come from membership subscription revenues. The visit fee revenue was up 93%, but those revenues are a small fraction of revenues at only 24% of total revenues in its best quarter in history.The stock now trades at nearly 165x EBITDA estimates with the stock price down to $165. To reach the old high of $200, Teladoc Health would have a valuation of 200x adjusted EBITDA. The stock would have a massive market cap of $15.0 billion.The key investor takeaway is that Teladoc is priced for perfection when the company is going to face substantial seasonal issues with medical visits. Investors should brace for lower stock prices during the summer lulls with a chance to rebound in the fall when Q4 visits pick up.The stock is likely to retest levels in the $120 to $140 range as COVID-19 fears disappear with an ultimate chance of falling to $100 again in a more rational stock market."

        The telemedicine specialist as seen a surge in visits due to COVID-19, but the Q1 results show limited benefits to the platform.
        Heading in Q2, seasonal declines in visits will hurt investor sentiment.
        The stock has an extremely stretched valuation at 17x '21 sales and over 175x '21 adjusted EBITDA.","Despite the huge surge in demand, Teladoc Health (TDOC) has seen the stock rise far in excess of the benefits of potentially one-time patients in the midst of pandemic fears. My investment thesis turned more neutral on the stock back in March and the surge above $170 is time to get out of virtual healthcare provider to conserve capital for lower prices. The telemedicine leader has already reported some impressive surges in patient visits. The average day now sees 20,000 virtual medical visits, up 100% from the start of March. By mid-March, Teladoc Health was seeing 15,000 virtual visits on peak days and 100,000 during the week. These numbers are partly incorporated into the 70% increase in patient visits during Q1 to 1.8 million visits. Just from additional members, the company had forecast an increase of 40% during the quarter to 1.5 million total visits without a boost from COVID-19. The COVID-19 boost could reach 300K visits in the quarter. The major hiccup to the story is the slipping app downloads. Bank of America estimated that core app downloads peaked at ~70K during the week of March 13. The downloads have now slipped to only 54K last week. One has to wonder if social distancing doesn't end up reducing the need for other doctor visits and end up crushing demand as the COVID-19 outbreak gets under control. As doctor offices and hospitals free up space to return to normal operations, the ~60% of visits accounted for by new users to the platform could vanish. The other issues it that surging demand isn't leading to improved economics for Teladoc Health. The company provided the following updated metrics for Q1:With consensus revenue estimates up at $173.5 million, the telemedicine leader is only guiding to a revenue beat of $7.0 million. On top of that, Teladoc had to spend an additional $4 million on additional physician pay to cover the surging demand. The end result is EBITDA guidance mostly inline with the original Q1 guidance of $9-11 million. Teladoc obtains over 80% of revenues from subscription access fees from members. In Q4, only $29.5 million in revenues were from visit fess. The updated Q1 guidance appears to support most of the additional visits fall into subscriptions that don't generate additional revenues. In essence, the company saw no benefit of the jump in virtual doctor visits during the quarter. Despite being a virtual health platform, the unit economics aren't designed to benefit from one-time surges in traffic. Teladoc will need to signup new members in order for the platform to profit. Only a month ago, the stock was pricey at nearly $130, so the additional $40 rally in Teladoc is absurd. The stock now trades at nearly 17x '20 revenue estimates only shifted upwards by $20 million to $737 million. Source: Stone Fox Capital The downside risk to the story remains the normal peak visits during flu season in Q1 will impact the physiological value of the stock. Last year, Q2 visits dropped off to only 908K, down from 1,063K in Q1. While Q2 started strong in April, an investor must expect the numbers to dip as the quarter plays out. The daily visits in May/June will inevitably dip from these peak levels in March/April. Considering the visit boost does nothing for the bottom line, Teladoc now trades at over 175x original forecasts for 2020 EBITDA of $70 million. The key investor takeaway is that Teladoc Health is riding a strong long term trend towards an increased use of telemedicine. Unfortunately, the stock has gotten ahead of the potential benefits to the company in the short term. In additional, seasonal trends could have a negative impact on investor sentiment when app downloads and daily visits drop for normal reasons plus the pile on effect of reduced COVID-19 fears around doctor office visits.Investors should use the recent stock surge in Teladoc Health to get out of any position and wait for a better entry point in the Fall."

We moved hard to cash earlier in the year, and finally to 100% cash earlier this month. You can read more about our market view in our recent blog post, The End of The Innocence. Having cashed up, we then set about trying to win in this new, more trying environment. So far that's going well for us but great care is needed.There are a few companies out there, amongst them Teladoc Health, Inc (TDOC), that are benefiting from the parlous state of the world right now. But even then, one must proceed with caution. Because they are few in number, those companies are priced as such and whilst momentum alone can be a wonderful thing, we believe gravity will in the end exert its pull on those valuation multiples. Why do we say that?Well, whilst every crisis is different, here's a relevant story we can tell you from our time weathering the dotcom crisis which took place in the days of Yore, being 2000-2002.In the new millennium, everyone woke up with a colossal headache after partying continuously from about 1994. Folks realized that ""eyeballs"", also known as ""users"", the key metric of the day for consumer Internet (it had a capital 'I' back then) 1.0 stocks, did not in fact pay the bills. Oops. This was a shame as it turned out there were a lot of bills to pay. Spiraling Silicon Valley real estate costs, rising executive pay, big data storage and web hosting fees (an order of magnitude or more greater than is the case today), server capex (no Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure back then), Microsoft and Sun Microsystems license fees ... the list went on.In the first wave of the crisis, the obvious stocks fell by the wayside. Webvan, an early online grocery store, was the poster child. Huge cash costs, hardly any revenue, inability to raise equity or debt at anything like reasonable prices, running out of cash, it hit the wall with inevitability. Other such unviable companies followed.So around 2001, everyone decided that consumer Internet was toast. But ""business to business"" or ""B2B"" stocks were fine, it was said. Because the Internet was here to stay. And companies were going to keep using the Internet. And that meant they would keep buying stuff from B2B providers.In many cases that statement was correct. Plenty of companies grew up around that time that are still here today. Akamai (AKAM), Cisco (CSCO), GoDaddy (GDDY) and many others are still with us, and prospering too. But they didn't step through the dotcom crisis unharmed.Here's the chart for AKAM and CSCO from then till now.Ouch. But the stock history from the time often doesn't reflect the underlying business. Let's look at AKAM as a great example. The thing it does has been in continuous demand from then till now. You may not know the business, but you probably use it without knowing. It provides caching services to content owners and network operators such that demanding content is placed near the user, not at the network core. So when you watch your next 4K movie or funny cat video, there's a good chance it's being streamed in part by AKAM. AKAM has maintained solid revenue growth pretty much since it got started in the late 1990s. The curve below is as smooth as you'll find. Source: YCharts.comBut the valuation multiple compression since 2001 has been fearsome. Here's EV/TTM Revenue for AKAM from then till now.Source: YCharts.comAlmost funny. So we have a company that has grown through good times and bad, which has sound financials, increasing unit demand, is far more a critical part of everyday life now as it was then, but you still see a brutal stock chart because of that multiple compression.And that's what you have to watch out for in today's hot stocks going forward. Not revenue growth, margins, cashflow, any of that. Pick the right company and those will motor along just fine. Multiple compression. That's your #1 risk in a current hot stock.So now we turn to TDOC.Teladoc Health, Inc (TDOC) is a great example of what good looks like right now. Firstly, physician consultations are of course on the up. And secondly, more and more people prefer to hold those consultations online rather than in-person - again a function of the environment. For what it's worth, we believe the shift towards online physician consultations will continue once Covid-19 subsides; so we think TDOC will continue to grow its business at the expense of traditional offline alternatives.Rather than have us bore you walking you through what the company does in detail, here's the company's most recent presentation, which is fairly comprehensive.This is a company that we were a shareholder in personally during 2019. As the market rose and we went to cash, we sold our long-term account position in the stock. We bought back in a few days back, added further to our holding, and then sold out for a decent gain. We expect to rinse and repeat the same. We've been buying the momentum not the fundamentals. But since our service is called The Fundamentals we figured we had better do the work on the numbers and having done so, we want to share that with you.You can think of TDOC as an industry-specific software/services company. A little like VEEV which we wrote up last week (here: Stocks To Buy When The Selling Stops, Part I - Veeva Systems).The key with these industry-specific plays is that you want to be a shareholder in the one with dominant market share. They aren't allowed to use that d-word, for fear of an antitrust case, but we can use it. Dominance, that's what we want to own. Measured by market share or, better, relative market share - meaning, what's your mkt share vs. the next biggest. Let's say you have 30% share and the next biggest player 15%. So your relative market share (RMS) is 2x. Big RMS means highest margins and usually highest retention. If you're going to join a community site you want to be on the biggest. That's why everyone's on Facebook not MySpace.We have yet to do the RMS assessment on TDOC but we reversed into the question by just looking at the numbers. In a market like this - connecting patients and doctors - where barriers to entry are low but barriers to high RMS are high - you can tell a fair bit from the numbers whether the company is a leading player or not.The numbers look good.Source: YCharts.comFrom 2013 to 2019 is actuals, and we've run some back of the envelope estimates of our own for 2020 and 2021. Note our 2020 revenue is above the company's guidance - again it's a quick guess based on the likely outperformance right now - we haven't done a detailed unit (price x volume) model so bear that in mind when you read this.The company looks to be growing revenue at around 30% organically ie. without acquisitions - that's good. It's running at a gross margin in the high 60s which is OK - not as good as a software company but OK. And, unusually for these unicorn-y type companies, it's pretty good on EBITDA and cashflow. You can see that it's burned limited amounts of cash in losses in the last few years and that it looks like it will probably turn EBITDA positive soon. Even better is the fact that capex and change in net working capital has been low the whole time, meaning that profit and cashflow are closely linked.It looks to us that the company can be pretax FCF positive in the next year or two, whilst growing revenues at 30%. That's good, and unusual. Finally the balance sheet is clean, with $77m net cash right now, and that's after a lot of acquisitions in recent years. Again, good.This stock is on fire. Here's the chart of TDOC vs SPY in the last three years.Source: YCharts.comYou can see the Coronavirus impact on the stock right there as we head into 2020.A closer look at 2020YTD:Source: TradingViewAs the market at large has weakened, TDOC has strengthened.And now the part where caution is needed. The market is asking you to pay around 18.5x TTM revenues for around 30% growth. (Which is in the same zip code as VEEV, except VEEV generates stronger EBITDA and FCF vs. TDOC).So - the valuation isn't out of line for a hot stock in today's market.But given we expect the market to continue to fall - with Q1 and Q2 earnings coming our way, we don't see many positive catalysts - we don't feel sufficiently confident to go to Buy - Long Term Hold on the stock. For market reasons alone we're at Neutral.We do think the stock offers a good momentum opportunity. And whether you choose to buy and hold for awhile, or trade in and out, we think the stock can move up and reward the brave.Speaking for ourselves, we're too concerned about a falling market dragging down all multiples to stay long on any one stock for very long at present. We'd rather trade in and out of a few favorite stocks, taking some wins along the way and where we make the wrong call, taking a small loss. TDOC is one of those few favorite stocks. At the time of writing we have no position but it's likely that we buy in and sell out at least once in the next few days. It's a great business with strong fundamentals and it can genuinely benefit from the current environment. But we remember 2000-2002 like it was yesterday and that means we won't be persuaded to hold long for now. Once the selling stops - different story - we believe then TDOC can be a long term hold.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 22 Mar 2020."
4339088,21798,2020-04-22T09:49:04-04:00,"Teladoc's stock increased while the broader market decreased during the recent COVID-19 crisis.Teladoc has recession-proof characteristics that might be getting a boost from COVID-19.The recent run-up in price has the stock at an overbought level, so investors should wait for a better entry point.","Teladoc (TDOC) provides virtual health care services 24/7 every day of the year. The company offers online video meetings with health professionals along with telephone interactions. The COVID-19 situation brought the importance of virtual health/telemedicine to the forefront.Teladoc has the potential to be a strong long-term investment in the 2020s as patients may opt for convenience and safety over the burden of securing a doctor's appointment and waiting in crowded rooms with others. Teladoc is projected to grow revenue above 20% annually in the coming years (consensus).Services that Teladoc provides can be appropriate for doctors to evaluate and recommend treatment for cold, allergy, flu, and COVID-19 symptoms. If you have something that is potentially contagious, you probably don't want to put others at risk nor would you want to catch something else from a crowded doctor's waiting room.Teladoc's services go beyond evaluating coughing and sneezing symptoms. The company also provides services for behavioral health, various chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, etc.), common skin conditions, etc. The company's services can be an important first screening alternative to going to a primary doctor in-person for certain conditions/symptoms.What makes Teladoc attractive as a long-term investment is the company's ability to grow at an above-average pace independent of the economy's health. People will need medical care whether the economy is expanding or contracting. The current fears of contagion regarding COVID-19 actually helps virtual medical services like Teladoc as it brings more awareness to this platform. Therefore, the company is likely to get a long-term positive boost from the current pandemic situation.Teladoc secured relationships with over 50 health plan clients, 70 insurance/financial services companies, 300 hospitals/health system clients, and 50,000 clinicians on a global basis. There is still plenty of growth remaining because telehealth services are still in its infancy. So, Teladoc demonstrated a strong ability to secure clients which will help the company continue its growth over the next decade.The global telehealth market is expected to grow at about 27% annually through 2025 to reach a market size of $22.7 billion. Teladoc is positioned well to benefit from this because they have a first-mover advantage. Teladoc is the largest telehealth provider globally. This can help the company accelerate growth by attracting new clients in new regions by demonstrating what they've accomplished thus far.Teladoc is expected to grow revenue at over 20% annually through 2023 according to consensus estimates. This should help drive the stock for above-average gains over this time period.Teladoc is working to expand the types of clinical services that the company currently offers. Mental health services are an example of an area that can be expanded on. About 1 in 5 adults in the United States are affected by mental health issues. The company sees this as a key opportunity for the expansion of Teladoc's virtual health care. Approximately 96.5 million Americans live in areas that lack sufficient mental health services.The company is also driving efforts to increase engagement among existing members. Teladoc is doing this by investing in their mobile app to be optimally user-friendly for positive experiences, investing in marketing to increase awareness, and by using surveys to measure progress. The company is also using its partners such as CVS/Minute Clinic (CVS) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) to help increase engagement.Other expansion plans include more penetration into existing distribution channels and increasing business globally. Acquisitions are another avenue for growth that Teladoc has implemented in the past and which is being planned for the future.Since Teladoc is not yet profitable, there are many valuation metrics that can't be effectively applied to the stock. We can use the price to sales ratio since it is based on sales and not earnings. Teladoc's trailing price to sales ratio is 18, while the forward price to sales ratio is 14.4. This is significantly above the S&P 500's trailing P/S of 1.9. However, Teladoc is still a young company with expected revenue growth of 33% for 2020 and about 21% in 2021.Companies in their young stages like this typically trade at above-average valuations as investors bid up their stock prices for their strong revenue growth and future prospects. Teladoc established itself well in the industry, which should help them leverage their growth for the long term. Telemedicine is still in its infancy - so there is plenty of room for further growth.What's a potential investor to do? The stock may pullback after the COVID-19 boost wears off. The stock recently reached an overbought level on the weekly chart. So, it is possible that the COVID-19 boost in the stock price might be priced in for the short term. A pullback might take the P/S ratio back into the single digits (see chart below), where it was trading before the COVID-19 crisis hit. That would be a better entry point for the stock.Source: YchartsTeladoc's stock had a strong run-up this year. It is now showing some weakness, declining from an overbought level according to the RSI indicator on the weekly chart. As a result, I don't think it is time to jump in just yet.Source: stockcharts.comNot including the market correction at the end of 2018, Teladoc's stock had a couple of sizable pullbacks of between 20% and 30%. The stock never reached an oversold level. However, the RSI did dip below 50 both times. It can be difficult to get the ideal entry point. So, using previous pullbacks can be used as a guide.Therefore, I would wait for a pullback in the stock of about 30% from the 52-week high. This would take the stock down to about $123. I would also look for the RSI level to dip below 50 on the weekly chart, then turn back up, indicating a return of new price strength. We should keep an eye on TDOC's stock and the rest of the market for a better entry point.Young fast-growing companies like Teladoc can experience a lot of volatility. This volatility can be magnified during markets like the one we are currently in. However, investors should think about where Teladoc is likely to be five years from now. The short-term volatility won't matter if the stock price rises along with revenue growth over the long term. That's what companies with strong revenue growth in growing industries tend to do.Teladoc is striving to expand the business over the long term with multiple strategies. This positions the company well to benefit from the strong expected growth of telemedicine. The company is building a good track record of acquiring new businesses. That along with other strategies should help maintain Teladoc's status as the largest telemedicine provider in the years ahead.With revenue expected to grow at strong above-average double-digit rates annually for multiple years, Teladoc's stock looks poised to achieve above-average gains over the next 3 to 5 years. The company has a recession-proof business and the COVID-19 situation helps bring awareness of avoiding medical office waiting rooms when possible. The COVID-19 crisis is likely to help drive growth in the use of Teladoc's services."
4332276,79675,2020-03-16T15:03:38-04:00,"Teladoc Health is garnering a lot of attention lately, but in my opinion, the company has had a strong bull case for years.I believe that this once under-the-radar telemedicine company is worthy of investment dollars (even at today's price) because its story keeps getting better.I am long Teladoc, and I plan to stay long the stock.","Teladoc Health's (NYSE:TDOC) stock has performed extremely well over the past few years, and 2020 may turn out to be the best year yet. To this point, TDOC shares have outperformed the broader market by over 100 percentage points over the last 52 weeks.Data by YChartsBut get this, I believe that Teladoc's stock still has room to run. Not only does this small disruptive company have promising near-term business prospects, but it also has a great long-term story to tell. And it helps that Teladoc's story (i.e., bull case) keeps getting better.As I recently described, Teladoc's story is simple: the company is disrupting an industry that needs to be disrupted. The company's suite of services is really starting to catch on, and the recent acquisitions are already bearing fruit (for example, the Best Doctors and Advance Medical acquisitions should continue to positively impact Teladoc's business prospects, as I recently described here).In addition, I believe that this type of growth (in members, visits, revenue, adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow) shows that Teladoc is properly positioned in a market that has a tremendous growth profile. Teladoc is far ahead of its competitors in this growing industry, in my opinion, and I do not see anything slowing this company down in the near future.Source: Investor Presentation, 3/11/2020Additionally, I believe that the growth metrics that Teladoc has reported for its top-5 clients shows the value that this telemedicine company has been able to create for its customers.Source: Investor Presentation, 3/11/2020And more recently, Teladoc's business (and telemedicine in general) has been getting a lot of attention, and rightfully so, as COVID-19 has caused a national (and global) crisis in a few short weeks. For example, Teladoc saw a nice bump in its stock price after President Trump made comments about increasing the use of telemedicine and giving governmental entities the right to use the services. More directly, Teladoc reported that the company saw patient visits increase by 50% over the past week due largely to the recent health concerns.Any way you slice it, Teladoc is a disruptive company that has a business that will likely continue to catch steam as we move through 2020 and beyond. Telemedicine is the future, in my opinion, and Teladoc may be one of the best bets in this growth industry.On February 26, 2020, Teladoc reported Q4 2019 results that beat the top- and bottom-line estimates. The company reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.26 (beat by $0.07) on revenue of $156.5mm (beat by $3.43mm), which also compares favorably to the year-ago quarter.Source: Q4 2019 Earnings Press ReleaseHighlights from the Q4 2019 results:The full-year 2019 results were just as good - revenue and visits increased by 32% and 57%, respectively. There is a lot to like about Teladoc's Q4 and full-year 2019 results, but the forward guidance is what got most of the attention:It helps the bull case that the current management team has been able to properly navigate this up-and-coming company through the recent market turmoil and capitalize on a very unfortunate global crisis. In my opinion, the strong forward guidance shows just how confident management is about the company's near-term prospects and, in my mind, proves that Teladoc is well-positioned for 2021 and beyond. Let's also not forget that Teladoc's management team has been able to meet (or in most cases exceed) its previous guidance, so I would expect more of the same for 2020.Investing in small-cap companies comes with many risks, but the major risk for Teladoc is related to the company being outspent by larger competitors. Additionally, the company relies heavily on its partnerships to expand its business, so deteriorating relationships in the industry could have a material impact on Teladoc's business.In addition, integration risk needs to be considered given the numerous acquisitions that have been made over the last few years. And most importantly, regulatory changes have the potential to greatly impact Teladoc's business. Please also refer to Teladoc's 2019 10-K for additional risk factors that should be considered before investing in the company.There is a lot to like about Teladoc Health, especially after reviewing the company's strong Q4 2019 results and management's commentary. Long-term investors will be richly rewarded if the company's story plays out like I believe that it will. Plus, the story keeps getting better.Teladoc has consistently reported strong growth metrics and the full-year 2019 results were no exception, which makes me believe that this company still has promising long-term business prospects. And let's not downplay the fact that so far 2020 has been a breakout year for Teladoc. I have said this multiple times in the past, but in my mind, Teladoc will either grow into a significant disruptive company in the healthcare industry or it will get acquired by a larger player. Either way, it is a win-win situation for investors.Author's Note: I hold a Teladoc Health position in the R.I.P. portfolio, and I have no plans to sell any of my TDOC shares in the near future."

There is no driving, searching for a parking place, sitting in a crowded waiting room of sick people, and then waiting in the exam room for the doctor. For me, it is about a four-hour ordeal to visit a doctor in my area.Telemedicine greatly reduces the time and the inconvenience of a doctor's visit. It obviously cannot be used for all your health issues however, but how many daily visits to the doctor are just to get his analysis.Teladoc Health saw an opportunity and started to fill a need back in 2002. Here is a quick timeline of major company developments since then.2002 - Teladoc Health is launched in Dallas Texas.2005 - Teladoc launches nationally.2007 - By late 2007, the company has about 1 million members.2009 - The company begins to raise private funding.2011 - Aetna begins offering Teladoc for its fully insured members in all 50 states.2013 - Teladoc’s sales double2014 - The Affordable Care Act leads to a large number of insurance companies signing on with Teladoc.2014 - Many large private companies like Home Depot, Rent-a-Center, and T-Mobile also sign on as customers2015 - The company continues to make acquisitions and it goes public on the NYSE on July 15 at $19 per share. It is the only telemedicine company on the NYSE. The shares surged 50% on opening day.2016 - The company expands into behavioral health, dermatology, and sexual health through acquisitions. They grow to 15 million members and have a 75% market share of the telemedicine sector in the U.S.2017 - Teladoc makes its biggest acquisition with the $440m purchase of Best Doctors. Sales grow another 89% from the previous year.2018 - Teladoc begins to partner with CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) on remote consults at MinuteClinics. The company also acquires Advance Medical for $352M. Advance Medical employed doctors in Latin America, Europe, and Asia.2019 - Teladoc launches in Canada. The company is now active in 130 countries with 27 million members.The company is not profitable yet, but its sales are growing very rapidly and gross profit is rising. My analysis shows that the company should be profitable by 2022 or 2023. In the meantime, the company is establishing a major worldwide footprint and has plenty of cash available until they reach profitability.Revenues have been growing by about 30-35% per year and the gap between sales and expenses continues to narrow. It is too soon to know, but the coronavirus outbreak could also be a big catalyst to growth this year and in the future. My numbers do not take this into account yet. I believe that the virtual workplace is going to continue to become a major force in businesses across the world.Data from Best Stocks Now DatabaseAs you can see from the graphic above, the stock has turned in some big alpha since going public. In addition to this, it has very strong relative strength right now due to the coronavirus outbreak. Here is what the chart looks like since the company went public.The relative strength of the stock is almost off the charts right now.Teladoc’s main competitor is privately-held Amwell, based in Boston, Mass. They are active in 44 states. They continue to raise private money and would be a likely candidate to go public someday. Teladoc Health is way ahead of them as far as infrastructure and size go, however. There is obviously plenty of room in this fast-growing space, however.Socialized medicine could also be a risk to this private insurer. It is unknown what Teladoc Health’s future would look like under a government takeover of the healthcare sector. That looks like a long shot right now, at least for the next five years.I made my initial purchase of Teladoc back on 12/31/2018 at a price of $49.57 per share. It is now up over 200% since that initial purchase. I added to my position two weeks ago when “telemedicine” was highly recommended by the CDC.This is the kind of stock that I want to currently own and buy in my Best Stocks Now system which combines relative strength with value. When I combine these two vital criteria, Teladoc currently ranks at number 12 overall from my database of 5,491 securities."
4335347,105619,2020-03-31T19:09:13-04:00,"Teladoc is uniquely positioned as the market leader in the rapidly growing Telehealth industry.Teladoc ranks in the top 5% of global stocks per our proprietary Momentum score, reflecting significant growth prospects.Teladoc also achieves an above-average Quality score, per our proprietary model, reflecting a healthy balance sheet.The COVID-19 crisis creates awareness and demand for Telehealth and will accelerate adoption of such services.We recommend Teladoc as a buy for investors looking to tap into a high quality secular growth story.","Thesis: Teladoc (TDOC) is poised to be a major beneficiary of the growth in Telehealth services, which solve two major challenges facing U.S. healthcare: rising costs and inaccessibility. Acceleration of adoption of Telehealth presents significant scope for Teladoc to capitalize on this trend, as the company offers the largest, complete, end-to-end solution in a marketplace where scale is critical in determining success.Teladoc provides virtual healthcare services or ""Telehealth"" via phone, video conference and mobile applications. It connects users to a large-scale network of medical professionals remotely, allowing convenient medical consultation on a wide spectrum of health issues, including non-urgent needs (e.g. allergies, flu, minor infections) to chronic, more complex conditions (e.g. respiratory issues, heart failure and cancer).Teladoc is the global virtual care leader - the company has 50,000 medical professionals on their platform, covering over 450 medical specialties in 40 languages with over 36.7 million unique US paid members and 19.3 million fee-based visits. Services are predominantly delivered via Business to Business customers (institutional corporate or private health plans & hospitals). The company has >50 health plans and >70 insurers as clients, serving >300 hospitals. Over 40% of Fortune 500 companies use Teladoc's platform together with thousands of smaller businesses. Its Direct to Customer proposition includes BetterHelp, which it acquired in 2015.In FY2019, 80.5% of revenues were generated in the US and 19.5% internationally - it is noteworthy that 84% of revenues are subscription based (providing recurring revenue) and 16% one-off visit fees. The company grew revenues at a 55% CAGR over 2015-2019 - a testament to the high-growth nature of its end market and rapid adoption. Medical professionals sign up to become providers on Teladoc's platform and are reimbursed for each patient visit. Customers (patients) sign up for services via subscription, or are enrolled via their health plan provider or insurer. Some visits are not covered by standard subscriptions and incur additional fees. Hospital groups also use the Teladoc platform to interact with their patients remotely. Customers can request appointments via mobile application or website and are routed to the appropriate medical professional. Figure 1 illustrates the customer journey.Figure 1: Teladoc Operating Model (Source: Teladoc SEC Form S1)Teladoc meets a number of needs present in the healthcare ecosystem. For example, it significantly reduces costs for customers (patients); a 2015 study found that patients saved an average of $1,157 over a 30-day period by using Teladoc compared to attending office visits and the ER. Since Teladoc enables patients to access services without physical barriers (travel time/distance etc.), we believe that the platform reduces search costs for providers, as medical professionals can be subject to downtime, in between in-person appointments, or may operate in sparsely populated areas. Furthermore, Teladoc enables efficient supply-demand matching, meaning that patients can now easily access medical sub-specialities, which are usually highly concentrated in big urban centers. The Telehealth industry is in its infancy and growing fast; Teladoc's total addressable market is approximately $29bn. In the US, Teldoc's 56m customers represent 17.5% of the country's 320m population. Internationally, Teladoc's footprint represents less than 1% of the population of highly developed countries.Main competitors include: Doctors on Demand, MDLive, American Well Corp, Grand Rounds, CareClix, MyTelemedicine, iCliniq and some smaller niche players. Apple and Google Play store rankings confirm Teladoc's dominance over competitor applications (Table 1).Table 1: Telehealth Apps ranked on Apple and Google Play stores (Source: Eonia Research, Apple iTunes, Google Play, SensorTower)Competitive Advantages: Teladoc has a number of competitive advantages, which we believe contribute to a robust moat. Teladoc is a very large Telehealth marketplace in the US; such marketplaces tend to exhibit winner-take-all dynamics similar to exchanges as the largest venue attracts more customers and suppliers. Being a comprehensive end-to-end Telehealh solution effectively forces large healthcare providers to either build their own platform (costly) or license Teladoc. Healthcare providers are not in the business of building technology platforms, hence significant impetus exists to use Teladoc. Furthermore, this also plays into the concept of ""customer stickiness""; once a patient/healthcare provider uses the service, data and medical history are managed via the platform meaning patients can change doctors easily with their records remaining in the Teladoc ecosystem. Consistent with this, renewal visit statistics indicate low churn rates; of the patients signing up in 2017, 46% of continued to use the service (repeat visits) in years 2018 and 2019. From an institutional perspective, once a hospital or healthcare provider has built an infrastructure around Teladoc's platform, it becomes operationally difficult and disruptive to switch to another platform.Teladoc's size and financial strength has allowed it to acquire smaller competitors over time, thereby strengthening its dominance and expand into verticals. The company has invested ~$1bn in acquisitions to build out its solution and strengthen its competitive position.Threats: It is our view that competition from US Big Tech players including Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG) is real, as they have expressed intentions to enter healthcare. Amazon has an in-house offering (Amazon Care), which it could roll out into a service. They could feasibly produce their own commercial platforms that compete directly with Teladoc. We believe this threat, whilst real, is insignificant owing to Teladoc's size and customer (institutional) relationships, which are sticky and hard to replicate.Another potential threat to Teladoc's long-term growth is regulation. We envisage that if Teladoc's dominance is recognized and viewed as a threat to competition, US authorities may bring anti-trust cases against the company. However, given the company lowers search costs of customers, we do not believe this is a near-term concern, similar to the way Amazon is perceived to lower costs for its customers despite its significant market share of US eCommerce.We examine the stock's cross-sectional characteristics as per our proprietary quantitative scoring model. Our universe consists of over 6,000 global stocks and we calculate and aggregate >120 sub-factor scores (daily) into 3 factor groups:1. Momentum (Top 5% of Global Stocks): We measure a stock's return performance and improvements in underlying financial strength. Our model indicates Teladoc ranks in the top 5% of companies globally on this measure, suggesting investors are under-appreciating the underlying change taking place. This is evident in the stock's price action (Figure 2) and relative return (Figure 3). The stock has clearly outperformed its local benchmark (Russell 2000 Index in Blue) and sector (Russell 2000 Health Care in Yellow). Without a doubt, COVID-19 has significantly contributed to this. Figure 2: Teladoc Price Action (Source: Eonia Research) Figure 3: Teladoc relative return vs benchmark (Source: Eonia Research)2. Financial Strength (Top 50-60% of Global Stocks): Teladoc maintains high Gross Profit Margins (65%) and a capital light business model as evidenced by high Gross Profits to Assets ratio (23%). The company has negative Net Debt of $47m, given Total Debt is $470m and Cash amounts to $517m - hence there is significant scope to take on leverage in the future and the company is not exposed to any undue debt burdens. Figure 4 breaks down Teladoc's Enterprise Value.Figure 4: Teladoc Enterprise Value (Source: Eonia Research, Company Filings)Teladoc's cash conversion cycle is healthy, with Days Sales Outstanding is 33 days implying the company collects payments in just over a month after a sale is made.3. Value (Bottom 10% of Global Stocks): Teladoc trades at a Price/Sales of 21.3x and EV/Sales of 21.6 and has negative earnings, making earnings-based multiples unsuitable. Without proper context, these high multiples are eye-watering, resulting in the stock's valuation being in the 10% most expensive of all the Global stocks in our universe. We believe these high valuation multiples are reflective of a number of underlying reasons, including potential significant sales growth over the next 3 years. Indeed, historical growth has been impressive and given the company's position, as well as addressable market, we can reasonably expect high growth going forward. Furthermore, the company has a strong balance sheet with a negative net debt position (Figure 4), meaning that Teladoc is unlikely to experience financial strain.Another potential reason behind the high valuation multiple is Teladoc's subscription-based revenue model. Companies with recurring revenue models tend to trade at a premium, reflecting the stickiness of revenues over time, as customers are unlikely to switch/cancel services. In addition, Teladoc has invested $703m over the last 5 years on R&D and Marketing, which we believe has resulted in the leading Telehealth platform that promises future high returns on invested capital.To place Teladoc's valuation into context, we consider the company alongside a number of comparable companies, which exhibit the above mentioned characteristics i.e. some combination of high sales growth, operating in niche markets, oftentimes in market-leading positions. We regressed the EV/Sales of this universe against 1-year Sales Growth and Market Capitalization and used the coefficients to fit parameters for a logistic model of EV/Sales (Figure 5). Our model has high explanatory power (70%). As per this model, given Teladoc's growth and market capitalization, it is fairly valued in the context of companies with similar characteristics:Figure 5: Actual EV/Sale vs. modelled EV/Sales of companies with similar characteristics (Source: Eonia Research)Based on the above analysis, we highlight three valuation scenarios for Teladoc:Base Scenario: The company continues to execute and captures 10% of total addressable market which translates into $2.9bn of revenue. Valuing the firm on a EV/Sales multiple of 15x would yield about 240% gain in price.Bullish Scenario: Teladoc becomes a near monopoly, akin to Visa/Mastercard in payments, where it will have built up a strong moat. In this scenario, Teladoc has captured at least 40% of it's addressable market implying revenues in the region of $11.6bn (40% of $29bn) and should trade on EV/Sales of 15x, in line with comparable companies. This implies a $162bn EV and assuming no debt is required would translate to approximately 12x gain.Bearish View: A competitor or group of competitors (most likely US Big Tech - Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple) invest a significant amount of capital into eroding Teladoc's market leading position through incurring significant losses for an extended period of time. Teladoc loses its leading position and growth halves, resulting in a sharp de-rating to 5x EV/Sales. In this scenario, we envisage that Teladoc stock would lose about 80% of its value. We believe this is an unlikely scenario given Teladoc's strategic value to a potential acquirer. In our view, it would be worth acquiring the whole business at twice the current price than to start over from scratch, as Teladoc owns hard-to-replicate intangible assets.Overall, we believe Teladoc will dominate the long-term growth in the Telehealth industry. Its unique market position and scale mean that it has already developed a robust moat in this arena. We view Teladoc as an extremely attractive asset and at $12bn market capitalization, is a likely acquisition target. We recommend Teladoc as a buy."
4335850,102107,2020-04-04T07:30:00-04:00,"The healthcare sector is on the front lines of treating, preventing, and ultimately solving the coronavirus issues. We discuss with our panelists how the sector is holding up.Treatments are easier to follow than vaccine plays, per our panel, while balance sheets matter as much here as anywhere.Gilead's name comes up quite a bit from the treatment perspective and its balance sheet strength.","The coronavirus outbreak and the effects of COVID-19 have gone deeper and wider than most people would have expected. That applies just as much to markets as anywhere. Whether it's a tech sector that is supporting our new work from home or re-rating as expensive EV/Sales multiples make less sense; a healthcare industry under the spotlight to find a vaccine, a cure, or provide treatment to patients; or various parts of the financial sector that have shown acute strain as the economy goes into the freezer for a few weeks, at least, there are no real safe havens or quiet zones.Healthcare is most obviously implicated by the fight to contain the outbreak and treat people who have COVID-19. The industry has long attracted investors who believe in the gamechanging nature of new treatments, but has also drawn criticism from those who believe the industry's practices are exploitative. A pandemic makes the 'you see who's swimming naked when the tide goes out' saying feel quaint for the sector, and it has certainly been a gutcheck for all involved. So where do biotech and healthcare firms go from here, and what should we all know about potential cures and treatments?We posed those questions to a group of Marketplace authors who cover different parts of the sector. Our panel features:Bret Jensen, author of The Biotech Forum: I think remdesivir by Gilead Sciences (GILD) is likely to be the first new drug to be approved to treat COVID-19 and May seems like the right time line for that to get the 'thumbs up' from the FDA who is doing a great job expediting approval of new COVID-19 tests and speeding up development timelines to combat this outbreak. Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are testing a promising RA drug called Kevzara. Hopefully, we also see some positive results from using existing anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in a two-drug combo pack. This just started to be used heavily in NYC on March 24th.Bhavneesh Sharma, author of Vasuda Healthcare Analytics: The treatment under development that I expect to get to the market the fastest is Gilead's remdesivir. I am however skeptical about a significant upside for Gilead's stock from this level considering the efficacy shown by off label therapies like a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc in treating COVID-19.Chris Lau, author of DIY Value Investing: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, did not expect any new treatments for this round of the pandemic. Investors should exercise care buying speculative stocks. Despite the risks, DIY marketplace guide users buying CytoDyn (OTCQB:CYDY) did well. Conservative investors may bet on Gilead’s Remdesivir that has a good chance of success.Terry Chrisomalis, author of Biotech Analysis Central: Doctors are already prescribing hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin to potentially help severely ill COVID-19 patients. Matter of fact, the FDA has already approved hydroxychloroquine for emergency use for these patients. The reason why this drug is good for COVID-19 is because it provides the ability to inhibit immune response. That's important, because COVID-19 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS, because a patient's immune response is severe against the lungs. That causes the air sacs or alveolus of the lungs to flood with fluid and it becomes hard for oxygen to be delivered to red blood cells. Another belief is that hydroxychloroquine also inhibits viral replication as well. Azithromycin is believed to help with pneumonia.As far as potential treatments in development, I believe that Gilead's remdesivir may potentially offer some therapeutic benefit. That's because this drug is a nucleotide analog which blocks a particular enzyme that is required for viral replication. Hydroxychloroquine has already been approved by the FDA for emergency use. Remdesivir may also get the greenlight for use, should several studies to be reported in the coming weeks turn out with positive data. As far as vaccines go, it will be roughly 12 to 18 months. That's because it will take time to randomize several hundred patients and then test safety and efficacy. Especially, if you want to make sure that there are no long-term negative side effects. Plus, you have to be able to produce millions of doses, which may take some time to ramp up. As far as profitability may go, it is likely that a good amount of revenue will be made, but that depends where it is priced at. In addition, it depends on the seasonality of this virus also.Avisol Capital Partners, author of The Total Pharma Tracker: Three approaches - vaccines, antivirals, symptomatic, mainly late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Multiple approaches within antivirals and symptomatic as well. No science expert should be comfortable discussing viability of preclinical medicine. Emergency approvals may see some meds in market by end-2020. Some commercial potential, but more important is the spike in stocks working in the area purely out of market sentiment.BioSci Capital Partners, author of Integrated BioSci Investing: There are a lot of companies making vaccines and antivirals for COVID-19. Due to the robust demand and lower regulatory hurdle for Coronavirus, I expect both antiviral and vaccine to come out before year-end.Bret Jensen: Given dozens of drug makers are pursuing a vaccine for COVID-19 there will continue to be a flood of news on numerous names on a weekly basis. I am not watching any particular concern that closely, therefore. I am concentrating on firms that are testing drugs to reverse worst symptoms of the virus (above) and when/how the economy will restart, particularly in large states like Texas and Florida that are seeing few fatalities/confirmed cases compared to states like New York, New Jersey and Washington.Bhavneesh Sharma: Moderna (MRNA) is my best pick for COVID-19 vaccine considering their mRNA platform and early efficacy. They have already started dosing patients and expect the vaccine to be available for high-risk people like healthcare workers in the Fall this year. I believe that an effective vaccine against this virus is a must as soon as possible since reinfection has been reported in improved cases from China and epidemiologists are suggesting that the virus could mutate and re-surge in the Fall even if social distancing measures are able to contain it in the short term.Chris Lau: Our DIY Top Idea Holdings include Moderna. The flood of money into vaccine developers will offset the drop in our other value investing ideas.Terry Chrisomalis: In terms of what may be achieved in the short-term is evidence that a therapeutic or vaccine has a pronounced effect compared to placebo. I believe that if a vaccine does report on highly positive interim data for COVID-19, it may produce the potential for talks with the FDA and possibly ultimately an emergency use.Avisol Capital Partners: I am watching remdesivir data from Gilead, Inovio's (INO) INO-4700 which had good response against MERS-COV, Novavax (NVAX) MERS vaccine, BioCryst's (BCRX) galidesivir, an advanced nucleoside RNA polymerase inhibitor, Moderna vaccine phase 1 trial that has already begun in healthy volunteers. These are some of the strongest candidates.BioSci Capital Partners: At least September sounds like a good time line.Bret Jensen: Hopefully we learn the lesson this time around that we should have learned after the Swine Flu panic of 2009/2010 like South Korea did with SARS several years later. We need to store medical equipment in various regions in the country like ventilators. That should make it easier to forward deploy this needed equipment for other potential pandemics in the future. We also need to build up testing capacity so we know the true extent of impacts much earlier in the cycle next time so we can avoid nationwide lockdowns and the extreme economic impacts next time around. Being better able to move needed resources (doctors, nurses, hospital ships, etc.) quickly from relatively non impacted regions to more impacted areas also is an area in need of improvement.Bhavneesh Sharma: Hospitals in hard-hit areas like New York City are like war zones from the experiences shared by ex-colleagues. Mostly, large hospital EDs and ICUs are well equipped to handle emergencies like a large trauma. Hospitals are however expected to increase their supply of protective equipment like masks and gowns as well as ventilators to prepare for a resurge of the virus in the Fall. Companies like 3M (MMM), Alpha Pro Tech (APT) (protective equipment) and Ford (F) and GM (who were picked by the Federal government to produce ventilators) are likely to benefit.Chris Lau: The US medical system cannot handle the pandemic if it gets out of control. No system in the world can. Germany's hospitals did, helped by low virus spreads.Terry Chrisomalis: Hospitals are doing the best they can, with the equipment on hand. There definitely will be a shortage in several hospitals for personal protective equipment and ventilators. It is highly likely that the healthcare system will be slammed for many months and it may mean lighter foot traffic for other illnesses. In cases of emergency, patients will still have to be separated and it is likely that Hospitals will need to boost hiring to handle additional work that will become necessary. That in turn means they will need a lot of cash to restructure their operations for the foreseeable future.Avisol Capital Partners: The situation here in India is different from what's happening in the US. Despite the negative media portrayal, you will be surprised by the inexpensive efficiency of India's welfare healthcare system for the poor. However, my doctor friends are reporting long lines of patients, coughing and showing other symptoms of viral infection, no social distance being maintained mainly because of the immensely crowded nature of the government-run hospitals here. This is not good. In the US, a grim situation is developing in cities like New York. The US does not have a navy medical ship to take in non-coronavirus patients for each of its 30+ large cities. If this spreads, our only hope is immunity, and the fact that, by and large, symptoms in the otherwise healthy patients are mild.BioSci Capital Partners: COVID-19 puts tremendous strains on hospitals in the US. They're not equipped to deal with this Coronavirus pandemic. Now hospitals don't have to be ready. But they'll get through it by being adaptable and resourceful. In the future, they'll be more prepared. After all, there is no better teacher than experience itself.Bret Jensen: I think the insurance industry should weather this pandemic in decent shape. Given extraordinary measures taken at local, state and Federal level, I continue to think final death toll will be between that of the Swine Flu (approximately 12,500) and the horrid 2018 flu season (around 80,000 Americans). Measures in the stimulus package should also provide a ton of funding for hospitals to offset costs. As for the longer term future for insurance/healthcare, that to a large extent depends on the outcome of the elections in November which no one can have a good handle on at this point given the extreme uncertainty in the economy and markets. Not to mention the complete dysfunction of our political system at the moment.Chris Lau: Cigna (CI) is waving out-of-pocket expenses related to COVID-19 testing and UnitedHealth (UNH) unveiled self-administered tests. This may earn both firms some goodwill and help grow its business.Terry Chrisomalis: In the short term, I expect that many insurance companies will likely change rules to accommodate the surge of patients they will have to pay for as far emergencies go. It shouldn't happen, but it's likely that costs may go up for some insurance plans of individual patients. Long term, I believe that things will settle down. However, this likely may not happen until next year in 2021. There are some generous insurance companies, which may go for a campaign and champion the fight against COVID-19. For instance, Aetna, Cigna (CI), and Humana (NYSE:HUM) are waiving portion of a patient's fees if treated for this virus. That is, patients won't have to pay the full cost of their deductible before the insurance company kicks in to cover the costs. This depends upon if the patient qualifies and may end up still have to pay a smaller portion. Hopefully, more is done to help these patients who suffer with COVID-19 in the emergency room.BioSci Capital Partners: COVID-19 exerts huge pressure on the insurance industry. Costs will skyrocket. And though I'm not exactly sure what they'll do, insurance companies will adjust their policy to be better prepared for unforeseen catastrophe.Bret Jensen: The migration to a more virtual work environment which has been underway for a long time definitely was accelerated by this crisis. Companies that provide services for virtual work and consumer services such as Teladoc Health (TDOC) or Dropbox (DBX) will see their business models enhanced. The outlook for commercial real estate especially in the office sector has definitely been dimmed.Bhavneesh Sharma: Teladoc is a telemedicine company which is likely to benefit from increased use of telemedicine for consultation in remote areas.Chris Lau: Followers who bought Teladoc upon my recommendation did well. Telemedicine channels may grow to alleviate the current congestion in the healthcare system.Terry Chrisomalis: During this COVID-19 period that is ongoing, it has really put a shift to telemedicine. I believe that this will stick, because of the obvious convenience that has been developed. For instance, telemedicine ends up being cheaper for the patient in terms of costs. On top of that, there is no need to drive several hours to a medical center. Lastly, I think it should be adopted more. That's because it no longer puts patients at risk that doesn't have a medical emergency. For non-emergency items, telemedicine could allow a Doctor to review old charts, determine symptoms the patients experiencing and then recommend if they should come in. This avoids going to the Hospital to potentially catch a virus or bacterial infection. I think this will have a long-lasting effect as people shift to this type of virtual environment. Elective surgeries may change in terms of when they should be scheduled. Possibly in another part of the Hospital. However, that may cause an impact on scheduling. Meaning patients may have to wait for longer periods of time just to get an elective surgery completed.BioSci Capital Partners: Even without Coronavirus, telemedicine plays an increasingly important role in US healthcare. The current situation is like a magnet gravitating us toward telemedicine. That aside, the timeless wisdom of buying and holding stocks at depressed bargain works in the long term. And that's how I base my core investing strategy.Jonathan Faison, author of ROTY: We've chosen to re-emphasize our focus on quality over quantity, sticking with just a few names that have significant derisking and downside cushion along with multiple value drivers playing out this year. It's important to have enough cash/dry powder to sleep well at night and also to be ready to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves. Avoid overtrading or investing in mediocre ideas simply because you want to put cash to work- wait patiently for the right pitches to swing at.Bret Jensen: In this sort of 'risk off' environment with such volatility in the credit markets, one definitely has to be more selective in these sectors. I am primarily investing in names via buy-write option strategies in concerns with the following criteria a) The company must be profitable or on its way to profitability. b) Given the turmoil in the credit markets, I don't want to add to names that might need to raise additional funding in the foreseeable future. Therefore, I am targeting companies with a lot of cash/or no need for it. c) I want stocks whose options are liquid with low bid/ask spreads, so any buy-write or covered call orders I place is filled quickly.Chris Lau: Although our biotechnology top idea stocks are lower, the DIY Value investor will buy on the dip and hold them for the long term. Their fundamentals are no different than before. For example, I hold Innoviva (INVA) and am watching Theravance Biopharma (TBPH).Terry Chrisomalis: I have kept my biotech positions for the long term. That's because I have invested based on a long-term horizon. By that I'm talking about biotech stocks that have proof of concept data with certain drugs and several shots on goal. In the short term they will be beaten down, but the basis is on the long-term potential. That is, when they reach phase 3 studies and could ultimately be approved by the FDA. Matter of fact, this environment has created a lot of buying opportunities for biotechs that have been beaten down for no reason other than the global markets falling on COVID-19. Eventually, the projected curve for COVID-19 should start to drop off. It may not happen immediately, but that may signal a quick turnaround in the biotech sector. Such a turnaround could happen faster if a potential ""cure"" or significant treatment for COVID-19 is ultimately released. Bottom-line I haven't changed any of my long-term biotech holdings.Avisol Capital Partners: Coronavirus has forced me to completely stop investing in mid-term opportunities. Either I am very long on fundamentally sound biostocks, or I am in a trading mode for stocks showing stable daily trends on a weekly basis. I have no illusion of buying stocks with a 3-6 month term catalyst down the line, and being able to predict with any degree of confidence how things will turn out. Therefore my latest buy suggestions to my subscribers are geared towards long-term stocks. I don't usually suggest trades.BioSci Capital Partners: Sir John Templeton said, ""Bull markets are born on pessimism, grown on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell.""Due to the extreme pessimism toward biotech stocks, they are trading at dimes for a dollar. As such, they present as highly promising long-term investments. If you average down on these stocks, you can make a lot of money at the next bull market.Jonathan Faison: Stocks with ""needle-moving"" catalysts in the near term (typically in the form of important data readouts) and those with a steady stream of material events throughout the year that appear unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.Bhavneesh Sharma: I am looking at adding to the biotech companies which are leaders in their fields with little competition and have catalysts like data releases within the next 12 months. Areas like cell therapy in immuno-oncology and gene editing are my top interests.Chris Lau: Moderna has institutional support and several quarters' worth of cash on hand. It is a potential winner. Regeneron is cash flow rich and is a winner in the COVID-19 drug development space. Inovio is a potential winner but the stock appears to appeal to traders.Terry Chrisomalis: In terms of potential winners, I'm looking for biotechs that have already achieved proof of concept in mid-stage studies. That, along with promising technologies that could shift the landscape in several sectors like oncology or metabolic disorders. Especially now, with this global pandemic occurring, there are many beaten down biotechs that have promising pipelines with multiple shots on goal.Avisol Capital Partners: Fundamentally, lots of cash and a good revenue stream coupled with lower-than-usual prices. Medically, stocks that are using the virus as an opportunity, or stocks that are focused on serious orphan drugs, or, in general, stocks with a non-divisive competitive space. My risk-averseness has increased considerably. I wouldn't invest in stocks with a high risk potential, whatever the allure.BioSci Capital Partners: A potential winner needs to satisfy my 3 M: Management, Market, and Money.Jonathan Faison: Trillium Therapeutics (TRIL) continues to be a high conviction idea for us. Our thesis is as follows: Trillium Therapeutics - Full Size Position (Achieved maximum weighting on March 12th and again on the 20th). I continue to believe that this CD47 player is significantly undervalued (consider that Forty Seven was acquired by Gilead for $4.9 billion). New CEO Jan Skvarka hails from Bain Capital and has moved quickly to streamline activity in the clinic and reduce cash burn. TTI-621 is the only anti-CD47 agent to show meaningful single agent activity including complete responses, and revised trial protocol has allowed for use of increased doses with no DLTs (dose limiting toxicities) observed so far. TTI-622 also looks intriguing, as it's intended for use in combination studies and just like the first asset doesn't have anemia issues that magrolimab is known for. Interestingly enough, it now appears that TTI-622 has activity as a monotherapy as well! Data updates for both assets midyear (likely ASCO or EHA) are key catalysts for us to look forward to, followed by initiation of combination studies. Lastly, Forty Seven's magrolimab produced impressive responses in AML and MDS patients at ASH (doubled response rates of standard of care), and updated data (durability, overall survival) in 2020 should prove a potent catalyst (TRIL to benefit as a sympathy play). As member Biotech Phoenix pointed out, anti-CD47 agents could address cancers where checkpoint inhibitors haven't worked and even more exciting is the idea of engaging both t-cells and macrophages to get better responses. Optimism is justified, but keep in mind the field is still in early stages and updated data sets are necessary before conclusions can be drawn. Time Frame For Upside = 6 to 12 months as we await midyear updates for both lead programs (Catalyst & Revaluation Idea).Bret Jensen: Based on the criteria laid out above names like Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), BioDelivery Sciences (BDSI), Exelixis (EXEL), Amicus Therapeutics (FOLD) and Gilead Sciences all make great sense for covered call candidates. With volatility spiking, buy-write strategies using just out of the money long dated call strikes provide much more downside protection and significant greater potential returns than when the VIX is trading in a more normal range. We try to outline one covered call strategy in depth at the Biotech Forum every week and also talk about others every day on Live Chat.Bhavneesh Sharma: Fate Therapeutics (FATE) based in La Jolla, California is focused on developing off-the-shelf cellular immunotherapies (both NK cells and T cells) for cancers and immune disorders. It is a leader in iPSC derived off-the-shelf cell therapies which are expected to have advantages like lower cost and faster manufacturing compared to the currently approved CAR-T therapies. The company has several data releases from ongoing clinical programs over the next 12 months. The stock is up >30% since bottoming two weeks back and trades at a significant discount to recent cancer therapy acquisitions like KITE (acquired for $12 billion) and JUNO (acquired for $9 billion), despite the potential for broader application, better safety and better efficacy due to repeated dosing.Chris Lau: I especially like Regeneron for its revenue growth from its current product line-up. I was bearish on Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) but am hopeful it develops a treatment for COVID-19. I am disappointed that AbbVie (ABBV) is out of the race with its small lopinavir/ritonavir study.Terry Chrisomalis: I like Advaxis, Inc. (ADXS) in this climate, because of its long-term potential. It has been beaten down due to the global pandemic of COVID-19, but I believe it has several prospects that could quickly turn things around if one can weather though these global markets. Specifically, I'm intrigued by the ADXS-PSA drug which is combined with Keytruda. That's because this combination regimen has already delivered solid proof of concept in treating patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It delivered a median overall survival of 33.7 months in this patient population. The median overall survival in patients with visceral metastasis was 16.4 months for those taking ADXS-PSA, which is very good since SOC only provides mOS of only 11 months. This product is already partnered with Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Advaxis is expected to announce its plans for next steps of this program in the 1st half of 2020. Advaxis also delivered good preliminary data in 2 patients with ADXS-503 HOT + Keytruda treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.There is another HOT product in development known as ADXS-504, which is also in development for patients with prostate cancer. This drug is expected to reach the clinic in the 2nd half of 2020. The bottom-line is that several of these studies have shown that Advaxis' Lm technology platform products, like ADXS-PSA and ADXS-503 restore sensitivity to checkpoint inhibitors. In essence, these products boost the potential that Keytruda already provides on its own as a monotherapy. My case for investment in Advaxis is in the potential of its drugs boosting the effects of Keytruda in two large multi-billion dollar markets. Both of these markets being prostate cancer and lung cancer. Especially for the non-small cell lung cancer market, where Merck pretty much dominates in with Keytruda.Avisol Capital Partners: I would buy Amarin (AMRN) at $5 any day. They just lost a generic lawsuit they shouldn't have, and tanked from $17 to $5. Everything indicates that they will a) prevail on appeal over a procedural error, and/or b) block generic competition in other market-related ways. The other group of stocks I like are the coronavirus stocks - NVAX, INO, MRNA, BCRX, GILD even. But these are not long-term likings - not all of them.BioSci Capital Partners: I like Fonar Corporation (FONR). The company operates a highly successful diagnostic management business. This Coronavirus bear market pushed valuation to a depressed level, which makes it a highly enticing bet for value and growth investors.***Thanks to our panel for their insight on where the biotech and healthcare sector is going.

4332333,22148,2020-03-16T19:35:24-04:00,"Teladoc Health reported strong demand due to the COVID-19 outbreak.The company has seen similar demand boosts during past flu seasons, but the stock offered better value in the past.The stock trades at a very rich EV of nearly 13x '20 sales targets.","Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) is currently riding a wave of expanded telemedicine demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. The company has seen booming demand in the last week, and the stock price is up over $50 in the last few months. Investors need to be careful here as the business typically sees demand rescind following the peak of flu season, and the valuation is now very stretched having already been priced for perfection in January.Image Source: Teladoc Health websiteThe virtual care leader was already riding a wave of fast growth. The company just completed a year where revenues grew 32%, and Teladoc Health predicted 2020 would generate revenue growth of nearly 30%.In the meantime, Teladoc just reported a week of 100,000 medical visits. The company saw a 50% spike in patient visits to 15,000 a day. The levels are above demand levels consistent with peak flu season.Back in 2018, my article discussed how the company saw a spike in demand in that January to 8,000 visits per day due to a vibrant flu season. Due to additional clients and higher demand from the current virus fears, volumes have nearly doubled since a couple of years ago.The company has a massive global opportunity. Even in the U.S where Teladoc Health has 56 million members, the company doesn't even have 20% of the U.S. population of 320 million. Existing clients still have ~73 million potential users not signed up with Teladoc. The company only has 1% of the global population with access to the healthcare systems and equipment to carry out virtual healthcare.Source: Teladoc Health Investor Day presentationIn addition, the company has a very small part of their membership population that utilizes the services in any given period. Teladoc saw Q4 total visits of only 1.24 million and 4.14 million for the whole year for a utilization rate of only 9.3%.For 2020, the virtual health company forecasts a U.S. paid membership of 44 million with another 19 to 20 million individuals with visit-fee-only access to a total of nearly 65 million customers with an exception of only 5.7 million visits.For the people with access to the service to utilize Teladoc once a quarter, the company would be looking at 250 million visits per year. The company is still far away from obtaining regularly patient visits providing the long-term opportunity for growth.A group of stocks are seeing benefits from the move to work virtually from home. Companies from Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) to DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) are seeing higher demand during this period while Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) ultimately could benefit from the trend. Teladoc Health falls into that category from the consumer side.This group of stocks was already hot this year and leading the stock market higher until mid-February. Both Teladoc Health and Zoom Video are now up over 50% for the year due to the benefits from the virtualization concept.Data by YChartsThe stock isn't very cheap up here at $128. As the below model shows, Teladoc already trades at an EV of nearly 13x '20 revenue estimates. By the way, analysts forecast the virtual care company to beat recently released revenue estimates of $695 million to $710 million by ~$15 million at the midpoint.Source: Stone Fox Capital calculationsThese numbers don't include the InTouch Health deal set to close this year by the end of Q2. The deal adds $100+ million in 2020 revenues at a listed cost of only $600 million.With the big flu outbreak in 2018 when demand soared, the stock offered a better buying opportunity at that time. Back around the Q4'17 report, the stock traded around $40 and forecast a diluted share count of 62 million with a 2018 revenue guidance of $355 million. The stock traded at a far better bargain of about 7x sales forecasts.The key investor takeaway is that Teladoc Health could easily rush higher as the company benefits from the increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the virus subsides, the virtual care company will see demand rescind and investors lose interest. The stock won't continue trading up at 13x sales, so investors need to be careful up here."
4330316,102646,2020-03-06T13:43:30-05:00,"Teladoc stock has been a leading beneficiary during the coronavirus epidemic.
        The company's valuation is expensive when you look at most metrics.
        Still, the company's long runway for growth can support this valuation.","From a distance, Teladoc (TDOC) looks suspicious from a value standpoint. The loss-making company had annual revenue of more than $553 million in 2019, and its revenue growth has eased. The competition in the telehealth industry is rising, and the company is clearly overvalued. As of this writing, the company is valued at more than $9 billion or 12x its estimated revenue this year. The stock has already risen by 60% this year. In this report, I will explain the reasons I am long the stock and why I expect it to continue rising in the long-term.Teladoc is the biggest telehealth company in the US. The company is taking advantage of the large and fast-growing concept of digital health by offering several products. The company has five brands which help connect patients with doctors; Teladoc, Healthiest You, BestDoctors, Advanced Medical, and BetterHelp.Source: TeladocIn the past few years, Teladoc has managed to grow its annual revenue from just $19 million in 2013 to more than $553 million in 2019. Analysts expect the company’s revenue to reach $710 million this year and more than $4.1 billion in 2030. This growth has happened because of the increased number of users who have grown from 13 million in 2015 to 36 million in the most recent quarter. In the quarter alone, the company added more than 1.4 million new members. Strategic acquisitions have also helped with this growth. Recently, Teladoc acquired InTouch Health in a $600 million transaction.Teladoc growth has come at a time when more people, especially millennials, are embracing technology in all parts of their lives. This trend is likely to grow in healthcare in the next few years as internet speeds increase and quality of care improves. Indeed, estimates show that the telemedicine industry is expected to have a CAGR of 18.5% from 2019 to 2025.The growth of this industry has attracted many companies. A good example of this is Zoom Video (ZM), the company best-known for video conferences. The company has recently launched its telehealth services that could compete with Teladoc in the future. Other companies offering the same service have received a substantial amount of money from venture capital. Doctor on Demand has raised more than $160 million, HealthTap has raised more than $88 million, while Ro has raised more than $176 million. Other well-funded companies in the industry are 98point6, The Pill Club, Maven Clinic, and Nurx, among others. The chart below shows Teladoc’s market share in 2017.Source: TeladocA key point of concern among many Teladoc critics is that this competition will affect user growth and margins. While this is an obvious concern, I believe that Teladoc’s first-mover advantage will always provide it with an edge against its younger peers. In the past, we have seen many first-mover SAAS companies build a moat that is difficult to penetrate by consumers. For example, while there are many competitors to Shopify (SHOP), the company has continued to grow its market share. The same is true with Zoom Video, Slack (WORK), and Salesforce (CRM).There are four main benefits of being a first-mover in telehealth. First, the company manages to grow its user base exponentially, as evidenced by the data showed above. Second, a network effect is created as the numbers increase. For example, a mother can introduce her children to the platform. Third, as the numbers increase, the company improves its relationship with physicians. Finally, as more people use it, the company generates more data it can use to customize its services. It can also use this data to support its current structure and even increase it in the future.Another thing working in Teladoc’s favour is the size of the American and international market. As mentioned, the company has more than 36 million paying members. This means that the company serves about 11% of the American population. As more people embrace online treatment and counselling, the company will definitely continue to grow. For example, even if it manages to serve 20% of Americans, that will translate to more than 64 million people. Keep in mind that Teladoc uses a Business-to-Business-Consumer model. It uses health systems, insurance companies, and employers. Even with its current scale, the company serves just 40% of Fortune 500 companies, which means that there is a long pathway for growth.I believe that the current coronavirus epidemic will help the company add more of these users and grow its market share. As you can see below, the search for the term Teladoc in Google has passed that of online doctor.Source: GoogleTeladoc has another main catalyst that will help support its growth. The company is able to leverage its scale to offer additional services and generate more income from its members. For example, when the company started, it was offering just online consultations. In 2015, the company entered the online therapy industry by acquiring BetterHelp for $4.5 million. In 2018, BetterHelp had $60 million in revenue, which is a sign that the acquisition is succeeding. The company has also expanded into personalized nutrition, which will help the company build and expand its moat in online health and nutrition. In the recent earnings call, the company said:Finally, another catalyst for TDOC’s growth is Medicare Advantage, which has more than 20 million users. According to the government, Medicare Advantage has started offering more telehealth services. This could lead to a substantial growth of the company. By January, TDOC had more than 15 Medicare Advantage clients with more than a million people. As adoption continues, this number could form a substantial amount of its userbase.Let me mention a thing about valuation, which is a big reason why the short interest has risen to more than 18 million. In fairness, Teladoc is not a cheap stock. The company has a forward EV to EBITDA of 147, which is a bit high, especially now that revenue has slowed from more than 100% in 2018 to the current 27.5%. However, I believe that the stock will continue rising as the company adds more American and international customers, and as it continues to increase the services it offers to its customers. Most importantly, I believe that the company will start being profitable – possibly in 2022 - as revenue increases and as SG&A expenses reduce."
4317947,25120,2020-01-20T17:55:45-05:00,"Teladoc continues to show impressive growth and is aggressive on the M&A front.The innovative business model at the time of the IPO in 2015 has now proven itself.The company is still not profitable, yet is rapidly building a dominant position in a compelling growth market.I like the potential, although I do not consider current levels to offer a great buying opportunity.","Teladoc (TDOC) is a name which attracted my interest already back in 2015 as the company went public that summer. I noted that the telehealth provider saw a strong public offering, as the business model was transformative, seemed to make sense in the future, growth was impressive and the potential market was huge.Nonetheless, I noted that a $1 billion valuation at the offer price made it a risky bet in relation to the relative modest revenue base reported at the time.Teladoc describes itself as a telehealth platform which provides healthcare through mobile, video and the internet. At the time of the IPO the company connected over a thousand certified physicians and professionals with consumers which suffer acute health issues.In the year 2014, the company had many customers which in total made 300,000 visits that year, as these consumers paid a flat visit fee of $40 on top of a subscription fee. Operating as kind of a middle man, the company offers compelling benefits to consumers and caregivers. Patients can have access to healthcare at relative cheap prices, while caregivers can control working times and do not have all the administrative hassles.At the time of the public offering, the company provided solutions to about 11 million members, often through large health care plans.Teladoc sold little over 8 million shares at $19 per share back in 2015. With 37 million shares outstanding, and shares having risen to $28 on the opening day of trading, Teladoc was valued at a billion on its first day of trading.This valuation was substantial as Teladoc grew sales by 119% to $43 million in 2014 while operating losses tripled to about $15 million. Momentum was very strong as first quarter sales of 2015 already totaled $16.5 million, for an annualized run rate of $66 million, of course a conservative estimate for the revenue base in 2015. Including the net cash proceeds, operating assets were trading around 14 times annualized sales, yet given the spectacular growth, this looked relatively appealing.When I got carried away and looked at the long-term potential for the business, I noted that revenues could grow to $1.5 billion by 2025. Compelling operating margins make that this could easily become a $5 billion business, resulting in compelling returns per year, although real execution would be required to justify this outcome. With the benefit of hindsight we can only conclude that the valuation target has been achieved, yet the same cannot just be said for sales.After shares traded in their low $30s in 2015 investors were indeed suffering some setbacks. Shares fell to just around $10 in spring of 2016. In March of that year the company reported its 2015 results as full year sales came in at $77 million, yet came in at an annualized revenue number of $90 million based on the fourth quarter results. The problem was not so much growth, seen above 70% for both the quarter and the year, but the fact that adjusted EBITDA losses quadrupled for the year to about $48 million.The 38 million shares represented just about $380 million in value at $10 per share, and that is even including $110 million in net cash. That suggests the business was trading at just 3 times annualized sales, despite the strong growth, as investors clearly had doubts on the business model, as this has been a huge buying opportunity.In spring of 2017 shares recovered to $25 as the company reported 59% increase in full year sales to $123 million. The full year adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed slightly to $40 million. That summer the company furthermore announced the acquisition of Best Doctors in a $440 million deal, a sizable deal given that Teladoc was valued at nearly $1.5 billion at the time.By the end of 2017 shares were trading around $35 as 2018 was set to become a spectacular year. Early 2018 the company reported its 2017 results with revenues increasing 89% to $233 million, in part driven by the Best Doctors deal, although the organic growth numbers were quite impressive. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA losses narrowed significantly to $12 million.The company furthermore guided for 2018 sales of $350-$360 million and adjusted EBITDA profits of $7-$10 million. Solid execution during 2018 and momentum seen for growth stock at the wider market pushed shares up to a high of $85, although shares fell to just $44 by the end of the year as momentum stocks at large saw a large momentum reversal.Early 2019 shares recovered to $60-$70 again as full year sales came in at $418 million, a 79% increase compared to the year before. The adjusted EBITDA metric showed a profit of $13 million. Investors were awarding a $4.9 billion valuation at $70 per share, at about 12 times sales, in part because the company guided for sales to increase to $535-$545 million in 2019 and adjusted EBITDA to increase towards $30 million, plus or minus five million.While the $13 million EBITDA profit looks compelling, note that it excludes $44 million in stock-based compensation, $4 million in depreciation charges and $26 million in interest expenses. Adjusted for those, realistic losses come in at $61 million, while GAAP losses totaled $97 million.2019 has been largely in line with expectations as the company essentially reiterated the sales and EBITDA guidance in the first two quarters of the year. Third quarter results were a bit stronger than anticipated as the company hiked the sales guidance to $548 million, plus or minus $2 million. The adjusted EBITDA guidance was stable at $30 million.Despite the fact that results were in line with expectations shares did rise to $84 again by the end of the year. This valued the 72 million shares at $6.0 billion amidst a flattish net cash position given the issuance of convertible bonds. This means that shares were still valued at 11 times sales, yet third quarter sales growth of 24% on an annual basis makes that the risk-reward might not look that compelling as the company is still losing money, although the business model has proven itself as it now has reached sufficient scale.The company has announced another large acquisition which looks compelling to shareholders. Teladoc is acquiring InTouch Health in a $600 million deal, as three quarters of the deal will be paid for in stock. Both companies look complementary, other than that InTouch is quite a bit smaller with $80 million in sales, while the company is growing its sales by about 35%. This values the company at 7.5 times sales, a steep discount to the roughly 11 times multiple at which Teladoc trades. This valuation gap and the fact that competitive forces might come down a bit is the reason why investors like the deal.Based on the deal multiples and the structure (mostly paid for in stock) I like the overall deal, yet trading at around 10 times sales, while the company is still posting realistic economic losses, makes shares look quite expensive. Nonetheless, continuation of impressive growth really has the potential to create value as share traded at a similar to higher sales multiple at $28 on the first day of trading in summer of 2015. Of course, the continuation of impressive growth rates makes that shares have tripled in just about five years' time.For now I see no immediate appeal here, although it is worth mentioning that shares have been sold off a few times quite aggressively as well in the past, having created great buying opportunities in the meantime."

This article reviews Teladoc’s business, its ongoing growth opportunities, the current valuation, risks, margin of safety and concludes with our opinion about investing.Teladoc Health, Inc. provides virtual healthcare services. It covers a widening variety of clinical conditions. The company’s platform enables patients and providers to have an integrated smart user experience through mobile, Web, and phone-based access points. It serves employers, health plans, health systems and more.Teladoc’s shares have performed particularly well this year, in light of the Coronavirus pandemic, which we view as accelerating the large secular digital transformation (more on this in a moment). We also believe the very recent share price pullback (despite this year’s strong gains for TDOC), provides some additional margin of safety for investors to consider (although in the long-run it will matter little compared to the vast upside potential).(Image source: iPhone stocks app)The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has brought a lot of attention to Teladoc in recent weeks as its virtual healthcare solutions are an attractive option for those who wish to minimize their potential exposure to the virus. For example, the CDC recently encouraged people to use telehealth services as the coronavirus outbreak spreads. Further, just this week Vice President Mike Pence announced that health insurers will pay for telemedicine services during the COVID-19 outbreak. At a time when the overall market is plunging, Teladoc shares have been very strong year-to-date.According to CIO Digital Magazine, “Digital transformation is a foundational change in how an organization delivers value to its customers… [it] marks a radical rethinking of how an organization uses technology, people and processes to fundamentally change business performance.” It’s basically an enormous secular trend that is greatly benefiting organizations that can stay in front of it, such as Teladoc. And according to popular blogger Josh Brown, regarding Teladoc specifically, “I think the nature of work has been a... secular trend in hiding all this time. Feb 2020 was a mass realization.” We agree because as shares of Teladoc (and other digital transformation companies) have perked up, there remains a tremendous amount of room to run in the long term.Teladoc has been growing, and will likely continue to grow rapidly, because it is a leader in an industry with a lot of room to run considering the large and expanding total addressable market. For a little perspective, here is a look at Teladoc’s historical revenue growth, and the size of the total addressable market.(image source: Investor Day Presentation)Worth mentioning, Teladoc has been experiencing strong revenue growth (both organic and inorganic). For example, according to CFO Mala Murthy during the most recently quarterly call:And for 2020 (excluding the impact of the recently announced InTouch Health acquisition):Teladoc is the largest in the telehealth business with the widest spectrum of doctors, specialties and coverage of consultation services, ranging from mental health to general and complex consultations including niche advice and care. Nonetheless, it still faces competition from a range of innovative companies, including specialized software and solution providers that offer similar solutions, often at lower prices. Competitors include MDLive, American Well Corporation and Doctor On Demand, which are all private companies.Despite TDOC’s rapid revenue growth and patient visits, it’s still only recently “operating cash flow” positive and earnings remain negative.(Image source: Investor Day Presentation)And on a price-to-sales basis, Teladoc’s has become increasingly expensive in the short term relative to its own history, however it is not unreasonable considering its long-term growth potential (the 23 Wall Street analysts reporting to FactSet assign TDOC a 32.5% long-term growth rate, and the shares continue to trade below their aggregate price target(Source: FactSet)Worth mentioning, these analysts are notoriously short-term focused, generally looking ahead only a few quarters or a couple of years (for perspective, here are the analyst sales estimates, as per FactSet).However, it is Teladoc’s long-term growth potential that is most compelling. And at a price of 9.7 times 1-year-forward sales, the shares are not unreasonable.Teladoc does face a variety of risks that should be considered. For example, competitors are expanding their range of services, and this could threaten Teladoc’s moat and pricing power. Further, revenue generation is somewhat inconsistent as the company relies on large contracts and some acquisitions. Further still, the share price is volatile thereby presenting downside risks (and buying opportunities). Also, healthcare policies and regulations are subject to change. For example, more stringent policies around telehealth could negatively impact the industry as a whole. Nonetheless, the strong secular digital transformation and benefits of telehealth are attractive.Teladoc is a rapidly-growing company that benefits from the ongoing digital transformation. The shares have recently performed well as coronavirus concerns have shed a positive light on the business and added acceleration to the secular digital trend. Further, the very recent share price pullback has provided a small margin of safety. For these reasons, and relative to the long-term growth potential, we’ve ranked Teladoc #7 on our recent list of top 7 growth stocks to benefit as coronavirus accelerates the digital transformation worldwide. There may likely be continued volatility ahead, however, over the long term, Teladoc shares continue to have significant price appreciation potential. If you are looking for a powerful growth stock to add to your prudently-diversified portfolio, Teladoc is worth considering."

I like the transaction, and my bias is cautiously Bullish.Santa Barbara, California-based InTouch was found to develop a virtual care system to enable hospitals and health systems to more effectively care for patients in locations outside the facility.Management is headed by Chief Executive Officer Joseph DeVivo, who has been with the firm since 2016 and was previously President and CEO of AngioDynamics and RITA Medical Systems.Below is an overview video of the firm's approach:Source: InTouch HealthInTouch's primary offerings include:Company partners or major customers include:Investors have invested at least $49 million in InTouch.According to a 2019 market research report by Acumen Research and Consulting, the global market for telehealth services is expected to reach $20 billion by 2026, up sharply from $7 billion in 2018.This represents a forecast CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 13% from 2019 to 2026.The main drivers for this expected growth transitioning approaches to delivering healthcare services to patients in their homes or places of business along with improved technologies that are enabling higher quality communications and resulting patient care. The North American region accounted for the highest market share in 2018 but increased government spending initiatives throughout the Asia Pacific region will contribute strong growth in that region as well.Major vendors that provide competitive services include:Source: SentieoTeladoc disclosed the acquisition price and terms as $600 million composed of $150 million in cash and $450 million in stock.With InTouch's 2019 expected revenue of $80 million, the price to be paid represents a price/sales multiple of 7.5x for a firm with 35% year-over-year revenue growth.Management said it will provide updated financial guidance upon closing of the transaction.A review of the firm's most recent published financial results indicates that as of September 30, 2019, Teladoc Health had $490.9 million in cash and equivalents and $574.7 million in total liabilities of which long-term debt represented $433.8 million.Free cash flow for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, was $10 million.In the past 12 months, Teladoc Health's stock price has risen 62.0% vs. the U.S. Healthcare Services industry's rise of 28.6% and the U.S. S&P 500 Index' 25.90%, as the TDOC chart indicates below:Source: Seeking AlphaEarnings surprises versus analyst consensus estimates have been positive (given its negative earnings) in nine of the last twelve quarters, as the chart shows below:Source: Seeking AlphaBelow is a table of relevant capitalization and valuation figures for the company:Source: Company FinancialsTDOC is acquiring InTouch to combine its existing consumer virtual care platform with InTouch' facilities-based platform 'to meet the patient at every front door of the healthcare system.'As TDOC stated in the deal announcement:InTouch Health will bring over 450 hospital and health system customers with over 14,500 physicians covering more than 40 clinical use cases in its facilities-centric platform.As the global population continues to age, the telehealth industry is poised to grow dramatically in the years ahead, as health systems face challenges in providing quality patient care across a range of locations.With the deal, TDOC is clearly making a bold strategic move and investors in the stock appear to like it, pushing the stock up over 14% since the deal announcement.TDOC's stock has been on an enviable run during the past 12 months; however, I can't say I'm impressed with its path to profitability. It's most recent quarter was an improvement, so maybe it's the start of a new trend.I like the InTouch deal but would like to see TDOC continue a move to EPS breakeven. I'm cautiously Bullish on TDOC."
4316896,22148,2020-01-14T19:12:14-05:00,Teladoc Health agrees to buy InTouch Health for $600 million.The virtual care provider raised Q4 revenue estimates to ~$155.5 million.The stock isn't cheap anymore at 9x pro-forma '20 revenue estimates.,"Before a presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference on Monday, Teladoc Health (TDOC) announced the acquisition of InTouch Health for $600 million. After being bullish on the stock earlier last year, the deal is likely going to contribute to the stock rallying above $100 and offer a good time to exit Teladoc with a nearly 75% gain.Image Source: Teladoc Health websiteInTouch Health provides the virtual care leader with a leading provider of enterprise telehealth solutions. The company is a leader in provider-to-provider telemedicine solutions with a partner care network of 450 hospitals and health systems with nearly 15,000 participating physician users globally.Teladoc Health is paying $600 million to acquire an estimated $80 million revenue stream in 2019. The company is paying $150 million in cash and $450 million in Teladoc shares, or ~5.4 million shares.The stock currently has a market cap of $6.5 billion after the 10+% gain, providing an updated value assuming no further stock gains in the $7.0 billion range. The deal has a predicted close in Q2.A big key to the stock rally is Teladoc Health updating Q4 numbers. The company now expects revenues of ~$155.5 million versus guidance at ~$151.0 million and patient visits to exceed the high end of previous guidance around 1.2 million visits.Source: Teladoc Health JPM presentation The stock has soared to all-time highs on the deal and increased guidance for Q4. Teladoc loses appeal as the stock approaches stretched valuations of 10x revenues in a sign the market is too hyped over the virtual healthcare provider. The company was quickly heading towards 20% revenue growth after Q3 sales growth was only 24%. Such growth wouldn't warrant the stock trading at 10x forward sales estimates.Source: Seeking Alpha earnings estimates InTouch Health adds ~$80 million worth of revenue at a 35% growth rate last year. Using 30% growth in 2020, the new acquisition will add $104 million in revenues.Analysts forecast Teladoc Health generating $685 million in 2020 revenues for pro forma revenues of $789 million. The stock will now have a market valuation of 8.8x sales estimates for 2020. Note, the reported numbers will be lower, as InTouch Health revenues won't count for the period prior to the deal closing.The stock last peaked in 2018 after acquiring Advance Medical to boost revenues. For whatever reason, the market doesn't report pro forma or organic revenue growth, so Teladoc Health is likely to get a boost from these additional revenues via InTouch Health.The company already has $491 million of cash on the balance sheet, so the $150 million cash payment won't require the virtual care leader to raise any additional funds. Investors need to remember that Teladoc Health does have $434 million in convertible debt, so the balance sheet isn't pristine.The market liked the company generating positive EBITDA in 2019, so one key point not mentioned in the acquisition press release was the bottom line financial metrics of InTouch Health. The company does offer comparable gross margins in the mid-60%'s range along with ~70% of revenues via a recurring revenue model to suggest the model is somewhat comparable to Teladoc Health.Investors should focus on the revenue per share metric not often utilized by the financial community. Teladoc Health had a forecasted 2020 revenue per share of $9.45 ($685 million/72.5 million shares), and the updated pro forma numbers of InTouch Health pushes the number to $10.13 ($789 million/77.9 million), due partly to the 25% cash portion of the deal.The deal appears to be very accretive from a revenue viewpoint without accounting for any synergies.The key investor takeaway is that Teladoc Health made an appealing deal to acquire InTouch Health to form a comprehensive leader in virtual care. Closing in on $100, the stock is getting pricey. Investors shouldn't plan to hold onto shares much beyond the magical $100 level."
4314623,21815,2019-12-30T22:55:49-05:00,"Virtual healthcare is a logical step to cut costs and improve services in the behemoth that is US healthcare, hence the market has excellent growth prospects.That growth has boosted the fortunes of Teladoc Health, the market leader in virtual healthcare.While Teladoc's growth, scale and scope is impressive, we think that the virtual healthcare market has low barriers to entry and competition will be increasing.We see several types of new entrants and even a potential shift in consumer expectations towards zero-cost provision of virtual care.","Recently, we wrote about the spectacular growth of Teladoc Health (TDOC), the leader in virtual healthcare. The reason for that is actually quite simple: virtual healthcare offers important advantages in cost and convenience.According to a Fortune Business Insight study:We have little doubt that Teladoc, as the market leader, will be benefiting from a big tailwind like this. However, thinking about the market, we see that the industry has fairly low barriers to entry and see competition from several main sources:The reality is that both barriers to entry and the cost of virtual care are low, which makes it a very attractive proposition for new types of competition to enter the market.Doctors and specialists, practices and even entire hospitals can associate, install conference tech and offer virtual healthcare. For instance, take Novant Health, an integrated system of physician practices, hospitals and outpatient centers, started providing online services early in the decade. From The Charlotte Observer:More recently, Novant has been taking it a step further and added some simple diagnostic technology, leveraging virtual healthcare. From WBTV:This isn't all that difficult to do, and we wonder why more providers don't do it, as it seems an obvious thing to do, saving cost and time for everybody involved. The obvious thing to start is video conferencing tech - enter video conferencing technology company Zoom Video Communications (ZM). From the company's blog:We know that Teladoc is growing big on mental health, which is a natural fit for virtual healthcare, but Zoom is emerging here as well, enabling Regroup, one of the leading telepsychiatry companies in the U.S. From the company blog:Zoom sees its videoconferencing and additional technologies as a substantial growth market taking its already considerable TAM well beyond that of UCaaS. It has developed a string of solutions for the industry:Basically, this more or less off-the-shelf technology enables medical facilities to embark on DIY virtual healthcare.Amazon (AMZN) is also moving into healthcare:It's Amazon Care that is of immediate interest here, as Amazon has partnered with Oasis Medical Group to provide the virtual healthcare service to its employees in Seattle, and the idea is to expand this to all its employees. From The Verge:We can't help but think that while this is intended for Amazon employees, there is no inherent reason, or limitation, to extend it beyond the realm of its own employees, and we're not the only ones (Business Insider):The explicit goal of Haven (a non-profit insurer) is to bring down the cost of healthcare, and it is experimenting with different kinds of policies that offer incentives (like lower co-pays, deductibles, prescription costs, etc.) if members meet various health goals (like blood pressure, weight, etc.).However, Haven doesn't own healthcare facilities itself. While its sheer size could start to have a moderating effect on prices, it depends on negotiating prices with hospitals and other providers of care.But virtual care offers an obvious starting point to produce a sizable effect on the cost of care, and this is exactly what Amazon is doing with Amazon Care. From Motley Fool:This might not even capture all the savings, as lowering care access barriers is likely to increase preventive care, especially when combined with the kind of incentives that Haven is experimenting with.The cost savings are so substantial that other health insurers have noticed. Here is one, Oscar Health, that is offering virtual care for free. From The Business Journals (our emphasis):While we're not there yet, and it might not even happen, we hate to think what would happen to Teladoc's business if Amazon would start to offer Haven and Amazon Care to all prime members, with virtual visits at zero cost.While virtual healthcare offers tremendous growth opportunities for the likes of Teladoc, the barriers to entry are rather low. While Teladoc, as the market leader, is ahead of its direct competition, other competitors are emerging that could make life more difficult for the company.Technological developments like the advent of 5G and teleconferencing solutions from the likes of Zoom enable smaller players, like hospitals and medical practices, to offer their own virtual healthcare, competing from below.Then, there are big companies like Amazon that offer virtual care for their employees and could very well open this up to the wider public when they have worked out the details and get the infrastructure in place.Or insurance companies like Oscar Health, teaming up with provider networks to offer virtual care, at zero cost. The latter especially is a threat to the likes of Teladoc, as it might shift customer expectations like Amazon's free same-day shipping has.This doesn't mean that there is no market for the likes of Teladoc. Not every big company (let alone smaller ones) can or will start its own virtual healthcare initiative like Amazon. For those that can't, there are ready-made alternatives like Teladoc, and they only have to sign up.So, while we see no immediate threat to Teladoc's growth, we do see a gradual erosion of its pricing power as virtual care becomes more established, and this is simply a reflection of the low barriers to entry and low marginal cost of virtual care."
4326715,104225,2020-02-24T16:46:47-05:00,"Teladoc has doubled in valuation since our previous article around six months ago and has surpassed our optimistic expectations.The company continues to exhibit strong growth and has multiple growth vectors at its disposal.We have a very favorable view of the industry and TDOC's leadership position, however today's valuation appears to be a bit rich.We think the stock may have limited upside at today's valuation and recommend value investors to monitor from the sidelines and look for a more reasonable entry point.","In our previous article, we presented a a detailed view on Teladoc's (TDOC) business and growth prospects. We theorized that the market was not fully appreciating the growth opportunity ahead for the company and the stock price was undervalued. Fast forward to today and our theory has panned out faster than we anticipated with the stock price almost doubling and in fact surpassing our expectations. In this article we will aim to provide an update on the company with a focus on any changes to its fundamental value. We also provide an updated forecast and valuation for the stock. Ultimately, we theorize the view that although the company still has significant growth prospects to tap into, the stock appears fully valued at today's price and investors should wait for a better entry point to establish a long position.Stock price since last article (Source: Yahoo Finance)TDOC provides a software that allows users to access a scaled network of medical professionals over their mobile phones from anywhere with an internet connection. The company also provides access to doctors over a traditional land-line. A key point to note is that the company's competitive advantage doesn't come from its software (which is actually not difficult to develop), instead the competitive advantage lies in the vast network of medical professionals that readily provide services on TDOC's platform. Majority of the company's consultations fall in the general medicine category however the company has been increasing its mix of services including mental health, dermatology, sexual health, wellness etc. These additional services provide a compelling up-sell opportunity for the company to its already significant subscriber base especially mental health and wellness services which are gaining increasing awareness in North America. In recent months, TDOC has entered into the virtual consultation space for hospitals by acquiring InTouch Health (to be discussed later in the article). Furthermore, the company has been expanding its global footprint with presence across several different countries.Source: TDOC investor presentationQ3-2019 Earnings ReleaseThe company released its Q3 results October and we believe this has been the main catalyst for the aggressive stock price increase since. The key stat here was the significant increase in subscriber base to 35M (from 27M in Q2 2019). YoY, this constitutes an increase of 55% and really exhibits the leadership position of TDOC in this market. The growth was driven by continued increase in notable insurance plan clients (e.g UNH) and increases in the behavioral health business as adoption of mental health and wellness increases across North America. Revenue growth beat analyst consensus and the company increased its guidance for Q4 2019. Management indicated that RFP volume is up 25% YoY and bookings are up 30%, which should translate into strong organic growth in 2020. Management remains confident in the 20-30% long-term organic growth targets which is a very positive sign for investors.Quarterly revenue and adj. EBITDA trends. Note that our adj. EBITDA calculation only excludes stock compensation and does not take into account other adjustments that the company includes in its own calculations (Source: company disclosures)Acquisition of InTouch HealthIn January, TDOC acquired InTouch Health, a provider of enterprise telehealth solutions for hospitals and health systems, for $600M. The deal was valued at 7.5x TTM revenue which is well below TDOC's current valuation of ~15x revenue. The deal consideration included $450M of TDOC's stock which shows the seller's confidence in TDOC's business and the company's use of a high valuation to invest it the business. InTouch's platform allows hospitals to provide specialist coverage in smaller communities for specialties like cardiology and critical care. This helps smaller hospitals reduce overheads by leveraging virtual consultations. TDOC's current offering helps hospitals provide virtual access to outpatient visits (ex: pre-admission, post-discharge) and is synergistic to InTouch. This acquisition further expands TDOC's set of products that it can cross sell to its established base.Despite our optimism on the business side, the significant increase in the stock price makes us a bit cautious at today's valuation. We have updated our forecast for the business below which now shows more aggressive increase to subscriber base and higher increase to PEPM as new services are added. We have kept EBITDA margins consistent as our previous article however note that this is likely an aggressive assumption given that advertising and market spend will likely increase as the company looks to expand. Overall, we think the forecast below is fairly aggressive and value investors should be cautious.What does this mean in terms of market adoption?Essentially, over the next 5 years adoption would have to increase significantly for this valuation model to come to fruition. While this is an aggressive assumption, we note that our forecast may not fully take into account cross selling opportunities into the established customer base which could provide additional upsideTDOC has exhibited very strong growth on the backs of industry tailwinds and development of new services. The company has many growth vectors at its disposal however today's valuation make us a bit cautious. We recommend value investors to monitor from the sidelines for now."
4312869,21815,2019-12-17T06:10:51-05:00,"Teladoc Health is the market leader in the burgeoning virtual healthcare market, which is in the early innings of its growth trajectory.The company has multiple avenues for growth, not only adding clients but especially increasing services which increases up-sell opportunities and visits.While the shares are not cheap, there is a considerable amount of operational leverage and cash flow has moved into the black.","Teladoc Health (TDOC) is the biggest virtual (on-line) healthcare provider. Given the cost and speed advantages of virtual healthcare, this is a rapidly growing market.We described the business model of Teladoc Health in an earlier article this year and came away quite impressed with the growth opportunities. Indeed, the company has produced another stellar quarter (Q3) and increased revenue guidance for the year:Data by YChartsAnd while the GAAP operational numbers are still quite red, their adjusted EBITDA is already into black territory.Q3 revenue was $137.97M (+24.3% y/y) which beat expectations by $1.51M. Apart from a small acquisition (Medicine Direct) this was the first quarter where the growth is almost entirely organic.There was a big beat in GAAP EPS which came in at -$0.28, a beat of $0.12 but almost all ($0.11) of this was the result of a one-time non-cash tax benefit.Where does the growth come from (10-Q):From the November IR presentation:Growth is increased through:Its B2B segment is the largest, adding clients like US Healthcare Plans, Medicare Advantage, Hospitals or International clients will increase membership fees (on a PMPM, per-member per-month) basis. There are a few (albeit large, like Aetna) clients with visit fee-only contracts, but they are not the rule.The company also has a B2C (or D2C as the company prefers) segment which serves individual consumers directly, although mostly through partners like CVS, now in more than 39 states.In Q3, some 17M people gained access to the company's services with UnitedHealthcare (NYSE:UNH) as the largest Q3 onboarding customer, as a third of their 15M members gained access.Increasing utilization and PMPM fees are great ways to improve results, but one has to keep in mind that the PMPM weakens temporarily after the onboarding of big new customers, like has happened in Q1 and Q3 this year (one can see the huge increases in net adds and the dampening effect on PMPM in the right-hand part of the graph below, from the November IR presentation):See for instance how recent big addition UnitedHealthcare (15M potential users) is ramping up slowly, with 500K members now using Teladoc's services.Management argued during the Q3CC that corrected for the effect PMPM would be at $1.07, but we see it gradually recover (unless there are new big additions). The PMPM rate also depends on through what channel the customer has been brought in and what type of customer it is (Q3CC):Visits were up 45% in Q3 (y/y) and individuals with visit-only access increased to 19M. Visits from paid US members grew 42% to 622K, increasing the utilization rate to 8% (+17bp y/y).Note also the following (Q3CC):This suggests important economies of scope in the business model, so it's important to increase the breadth of services. Indeed (Q3CC):This is exactly what the company is doing, and it regularly introduces new services, like this quarter Teladoc Medical Experts and lately personalized nutrition advice. New services:Internationally, the company entered the Spanish-speaking market with the $352 million acquisition of Advance Medical, the French market with the acquisition of Medicin Direct and the launch of the Canadian Telemedicine program, which is seamless with the US program it entered the Canadian market.The company's main selling points are speed and cost. Visits (at least those in the US) are scheduled with an average time of 10 minutes and have a significant average cost advantage. From the 2018 10-K:But these are advantages that, to various extents, hold for all virtual care providers so what distinguishes Teladoc from the competition?Management also argued (Q3CC):There are a host of new competitors that offer solutions for a particular field (back pain, obesity, diabetes, etc.) but management notes (Q3CC):The latter also indicates a nice opportunity partnering with these specialist providers and it's not the only one they have (Q3CC):From the earnings PR:The revenue (now $546M 550M from $538M-545M) and non-GAAP EBITDA (now $28M-32M from $27M-33M) and total visits (now 3.9M-4.1M from 3.7M-4.0M) were all increased.Data by YChartsThere is some seasonality in gross margin as the flu season increases visits in the product mix. The operational metrics are in GAAP, however (Q3CC):This suggests considerable operational leverage. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $9M, up from $6.3M a year ago.Data by YChartsCash flows are improving with the revenue growth and operational leverage, and are already well into the black.The company has $490.9M in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, a sequential improvement of $18M. Total debt is $562.5M, consisting of two convertible notes; the $275M, 3% convertible note that matures at the end of 2022 and the $287.5M 1.38% note that matures in 2025.The cash flow should slow the dilution, although most of this is the result of acquisitions.Data by YChartsData by YChartsAnalysts expect losses of $1.43 per share this year falling to $1.09 next year.Teladoc is the market leader in virtual healthcare, a market that given the cost and convenience advantages, is likely to display a healthy growth for years to come.The company is growing revenues in the mid 20s, it's benefiting from economies of scale and scope and increased utilization. With gross margins at nearly 70% and operational leverage kicking in, the financials are set to improve substantially over the next couple of years.Given the substantial multiple on the shares, it will have to deliver on financial metrics as the shares are not cheap. It's what you pay for a market leader in a growth sector but given the fact that cash flow is now positive, things should get better here."
4314616,105320,2019-12-31T09:30:00-05:00,"Teladoc has been on a roll since it first appeared on our radar back in  September.
        We believe industry tailwind will continue fueling the company's growth.
        We see positive momentum for the near future, but concern around our cost-benefit analysis of telehealth is keeping us cautious for the long-term.
        We initiate coverage with a short-term Buy rating.","We've always been a fan of direct communication within the team. Leaving our egos and the sugar-coating behind for quality feedbacks and constructive criticisms have helped us learn from our experiences. We also prefer to leave out the BS and provide you with the information we think is relevant to consider.With that in mind, we thought it'd be great to share some of our opinions on investments that we feel mixed towards due to our simultaneous short-term bullish thesis and long-term bearish, contrarian view. Teladoc (NYSE: TDOC) has been a company we started following back in September when we started exploring a number of private investments in the venture capital space. While we found TDOC to lack any real technological moat vs. other established players operating privately in telehealth, we liked the first-mover advantage that gave the company important partnerships with players in the healthcare and insurance space. We also believe the continued growing awareness and usage of telehealth will drive the company's growth.At the same time, we caution investors from being overly optimistic about the growth trajectory of the company due to the increasingly competitive nature of the telehealth industry and the potentially unexpected cost of virtual care for insurance providers. Teladoc is a telehealth company that provides consumers access to physicians and healthcare specialists through a virtual platform. Patients have the option to access care through video, call, or chat. Many insurance providers have partnered up with Teladoc to provide telehealth service as a benefit. Those without insurance can also utilize the service through Teladoc's mobile phone app. (Source: Teladochealth.com)Since last Christmas Eve, TDOC's share price has skyrocketed by almost 89% to $80.94 as of 12/18/2019. We weren't surprised to hear the company's positive news around Q3 and the higher guidance provided by the management team. Telehealth has enjoyed higher adoption and utilization rates in the past few years, and these trends are expected to continue as consumers become more aware of the telehealth industry. (Source: Capital IQ as of 12/18/2019)Teladoc posted solid Q3 2019 results, with revenue hitting $137.97mm, which represented a 24.3% increase YoY. This marked a slow down in growth compared to last year when revenue grew by almost 62%. As a high-growth company, we see Teladoc reaching a somewhat mature stage in terms of growth. Teladoc touted its 70% market share on its Q3 2016 earnings presentation, but we believe this number has gone down since then due to new, private players entering the market. (Source: Tikr.com) Net loss and EPS for the quarter was ($20.35mm) and ($0.28), respectively, and show an overall improvement throughout 2019.(Source: Tikr.com)Healthcare spending in the US was over $3.5tn in 2017, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and BCC Research expects spending to continue to increase at an average of 5.5% per year through 2025. It's worth noting that these costs can be prevented due to the fact that 86% of healthcare cost is related to avoidable, chronic medical conditions. However, it's worth noting that even if patients want to see a doctor, it's often difficult to do so due to the time, cost, and convenience of seeking medical care. A 2017 survey by Merritt Hawkins showed that the current wait time for new patients in major metropolitan areas averaged 18.5 days, and BCC Research expects the continued growing shortage of healthcare professionals to exacerbate the problem.(Source: Merritt Hawkins)The biggest catalyst for Teladoc lies in its potential solution for the problematic state of the current healthcare system in the US. According to IBISWorld, telehealth has the potential to 1) improve access to healthcare, 2) boost the quality of care, and 3) increase cost efficiencies. Telehealth makes it convenient for people to access healthcare: they are able to see a doctor from any location without the need to travel or take time off from work. They can also save money by speaking to a doctor through an app rather than going to the emergency room or urgent care. As seen below, using telehealth is significantly cheaper than going to the doctor's office or the emergency room.(Sources: Health Affairs, FAIR Health, Author presentation)According to BCC Research, telehealth users are expected to reach 551mm by 2020. This is in-line with their survey that showed that 76% of US patients prioritize access to care over the need for human interaction, while 70% are comfortable communicating via text, email, and video. Surprisingly, only 20% of the population is aware of this sort of service, yet according to Pew Research Center, 60% of internet users in America used online searches for health-related topics. During our own market survey, we were able to confirm this lack of awareness among the general population. It's not surprising when considering the serious lack of marketing surrounding the telehealth industry. We see ads around New York City for mobile prescription services, but none related to Teladoc or other, similar virtual care services. The legislative environment has been conducive to telehealth as well. Previously, practicing medicine across different states carried many restrictions and oftentimes required multiple licenses. However, over 20 states have passed legislation that promotes telehealth growth and mandates that telehealth services be reimbursed at the same rate as in-person visits. We also believe telehealth will be driven by the younger generation. Millennials currently account for the largest living generation with about 83mm people. Their preference for convenience, fast service, connectivity, and price transparency will lead them to utilize telehealth at a far higher rate than the older generation. Our analysis shows that only about 0.17% of total medical consultations in the US were captured by the telehealth industry in 2017.(Sources: Centers for Disease Control, TDOC 2017 10-K filing, Author calculations)While it's true that telehealth cannot address all medical consultations, we believe there are about 370mm addressable medical consultations for telehealth, which is far smaller than the 1.92mm telehealth consultations done in 2017. (Sources: Centers for Disease Control, Teladoc’s presentation for 36th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, Author estimates)Despite the significant industry tailwind, Teladoc faces many competitors in the private space. The table below illustrates some of Teladoc's competitors. It should be noted that they do not include competitors with less than $100mm in funding. (Source: PitchBook, CB Insights, Author presentation)The biggest item to note is the area of care they are in. Many of the competitors offer the same exact services as Teladoc. Babylon Health, which we believe is Teladoc's biggest threat and competitor, operates outside of the US and has a strategic partnership with the United Kingdom's National Healthcare System to provide virtual care for its citizens. Babylon Health already threatens Teladoc's international business, but it could also become a serious risk to Teladoc's domestic business if it enters into the US. Another point to note is Babylon Health's AI symptom checker, which can be used as a triage tool to effectively identify serious conditions that may need to be taken care of immediately. Babylon's claim around its AI symptom checker has been controversial, with some experts objecting to the accuracy of the system. However, it highlights some of the technological shortfalls of Teladoc and illustrates the constant threat of new technology within the telehealth industry. Amazon Enters the GameAmazon made headlines in September after announcing the launch of a pilot telehealth program for some of its Washington-based employees. Teladoc stock dropped as much as 6% premarket before settling down below 2% at the end of the day. Many investors brushed off the news, but we believe this is a serious threat worth considering. As mentioned earlier, Teladoc has no significant technological moat to prevent large entities like Amazon, Google, or Apple from entering into the telehealth industry. We personally believe Amazon is well-positioned as an entrant into the industry due to its existing paid, subscription service: Amazon Prime. The telehealth service could be bundled up into Amazon Prime, and many of Amazon's existing subscribers voiced their positive view of this type of service on Twitter. Telehealth has the potential to lower costs for insurance providers if the cost of telehealth is lower than the cost of traditional medicine getting replaced. Accordingly, two factors come into play: 1) The substitution of physician’s office visits and ED visits for telehealth and 2) the total utilization rate of telehealth. Here, we consider the utilization rate to be the percentage of people with access to telehealth that actually uses the service.The ideal situation is that the slight bump in cost related to telehealth ends up lowering the cost associated with traditional medicine. This would justify the cost of telehealth. However, an alternative scenario could be that telehealth costs are much higher than expected and end up costing insurance providers much more than the cost of traditional medicine. According to one study, this is precisely what was observed. A study published in Health Affairs showed that telehealth could potentially increase healthcare spending due to easier access and a higher utilization rate. The percentage of people substituting a traditional doctor's office visit for telehealth was only around 11.8%, while people utilizing telehealth due to its easy access was 88.2%. This is in direct contrast with the claim of Teladoc and American Well (a competitor) that new utilization rate was around 10%. (Source: Health Affairs)Just like any insurance product, insurance providers make more money off of the premiums when insured individuals don't utilize their benefits. The aforementioned study showed that easy access to care led to higher utilization of the service. While it's difficult to make any definitive conclusion with this one study, investors should take it into consideration when looking at the long-term viability of telehealth as a benefit provided by insurance providers.There are many key catalysts driving Teladoc's bull thesis. In its current state, we believe Teladoc has plenty of room to grow as more consumers adopt telehealth into their everyday lives. At the same time, concerns around the competitive nature of the industry and Teladoc's lack of technological moat are causes of concern. We believe more time is needed to realize the true cost of telehealth for insurance providers, and accordingly, we urge potential investors to look into this area as the industry matures."
4305290,79675,2019-11-10T22:58:10-05:00,"Teladoc recently reported strong Q3 2019 results that beat the top- and bottom-line estimates. Additionally, management raised its full-year 2019 guidance for revenue and visits.This under-the-radar telehealth company has a strong bull case and, in my opinion, Teladoc is worthy of investment dollars even at today's price.I am long Teladoc, and I plan to stay long the stock.","Teladoc Health's (TDOC) stock has performed extremely well over the past few years, and 2019 has been more of the same. TDOC shares are outperforming the broader market by almost 40 percentage points over the last 11-plus months.Data by YChartsI believe that the stock still has room to run, especially if you are willing (and able) to hold on to shares for the next few years. This under-the-radar company not only has a bullish long-term story to tell, but it also has promising near-term business prospects. And Teladoc's recently reported results (and management commentary) prove it.On October 30, 2019, Teladoc reported Q3 2019 results that beat the top- and bottom-line estimates. The company reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.28 (beat by $0.12) on revenue of $137.97M (beat by $1.51m), which also compares favorably to the year-ago quarter.Source: Q3 2019 Earnings Press ReleaseHighlights from the quarter:There is a lot to like about Teladoc's Q3 2019 results and operating metrics, but it is important to note that management also had a great story to tell during the conference call. Additionally, management took the chance to raise its full-year 2019 guidance for two key metrics, i.e., revenue and visits, after talking up the results for the last three months.For full-year 2019, management provided the following guidance:The increased top-line and visits guidance shows how confident management is about the company's near-term prospects and, in my opinion, proves that the newish team believes that Teladoc will be in a great position when it enters 2020.Teladoc's story is simple: the company is disrupting an industry that needs to be disrupted. The company's suite of services is really starting to catch on, and the recent acquisitions are already bearing fruit (for example, the Best Doctor and Advance Medical acquisitions should continue to positively impact Teladoc's business prospects, as I recently described here).Moreover, I believe that Teladoc has a significant market opportunity that continues to expand - a few metrics highlight this point:Source: 2018 Annual Report I believe that this type of growth [in members, visits and revenue] shows that Teladoc is properly positioned in a market that has promising prospects. Additionally, the estimated current total addressable market (estimated to be well north of $50B) will eventually turn out to be too low of a target, in my opinion, and Teladoc is far ahead of its competitors in this growing industry. Virtual care is the future, in my mind.At the end of the day, I believe that the company's most recent results (and guidance) made the bull case for this exciting, small-cap company stronger.Teladoc's stock is trading in a reasonable price-to-sales range, even after the recent run-up.Data by YChartsThe stock is not cheap by any means, but I do believe that Teladoc will more than grow into its current valuation. This disruptive company has a significant growth profile and let's not forget that there is a real potential that a larger player may soon try to acquire this game-changing telehealth company. As such, I would not consider selling my Teladoc stock anywhere near the current level. However, if you offer me $100 per share , I would think about it.Investing in small-cap companies comes with many risks, but the major risk for Teladoc is related to the company being outspent by larger competitors. Additionally, the company relies heavily on its partnerships to expand its business, so deteriorating relationships in the industry could have a material impact on Teladoc's business.In addition, integration risk needs to be considered given the numerous acquisitions that have been made over the last few years. And most importantly, regulatory changes have the potential to greatly impact Teladoc's business. Please also refer to Teladoc's 2018 10-K for additional risk factors that should be considered before investing in the company.There is a lot to like about Teladoc Health, especially after reviewing the company's strong Q3 2019 results and management's commentary. Long-term investors will be richly rewarded if the company's story plays out like I believe that it will. Teladoc has consistently reported strong growth metrics, which makes me believe that this company still has promising long-term business prospects. It helps the bull case that the market also seems to be on the same page (notice the impressive YTD performance of the stock).In my mind, Teladoc will either grow into a significant disruptive company in the healthcare industry or it will get acquired by a larger player. Either way, it is a win-win situation for investors. In my opinion, the risk for Teladoc's stock is to the upside if you are in it for the long haul.Author's Note: I hold a Teladoc Health position in the R.I.P. portfolio, and I have no plans to sell any of my TDOC shares in the near future."
4303151,104761,2019-11-06T09:43:42-05:00,"Teladoc reported continued strong organic sales growth and increased full year guidance heading into Q4.Its recent partnership with major insurer, UnitedHealth, dramatically boosted membership and lends credence to Teladoc as a leading provider of telehealth.The UnitedHealth partnership could result in more growth opportunities for Teladoc as the UnitedHealth has nearly 50 million members across commercial and government insurance programs.Teladoc price has spiked as of late and the company remains unprofitable. Another selloff could provide a better entry point for a company that has growth potential.","Teladoc (TDOC) reported another quarter of solid 20%+ organic revenue growth. The company reported record subscription membership and also boosted its non-subscription membership dramatically.The bulk of the membership increase was attributable to Teladoc's new partnership with behemoth insurer, UnitedHealth. Teladoc gains exposure to 15 million of UnitedHealth's commercial plan members. Five million of those members will be subscription per-member-per-month (PMPM) Teladoc members. The other 10 million will be non-subscription members that Teladoc can charge visit fee-only charges.The UnitedHealth exposure dramatically boosts Teladoc's patient exposure. The company now has 35 million PMPM members, up more than 50% from a year ago. And visit fee-only membership now stands at 19 million, nearly doubling from a year ago.Though Teladoc is one of several quality telehealth companies in the market, it has the largest patient exposure and has a lot of momentum working in its favor as more employers and insurers see the benefits of encouraging patients to use telehealth. I am long Teladoc.You won't find a press release about the UnitedHealth contract on Teladoc's website. UnitedHealth issued the October announcement. In reviewing UnitedHealth's telehealth information page, the company notes that it has three telehealth providers: Teladoc, American Well, and Doctor on Demand.SourceThough Teladoc is not UnitedHealth's sole telehealth provider, the partnership with America's largest private insurer is another major step forward for Teladoc. Many have argued that telehealth is too competitive and that it will be impossible to pick a winner. But Teladoc has a lot of wind in its sails. It is the most widely used telehealth provider and its partnership with UnitedHealth simply fans those flames.In the quarter, Teladoc also saw 23% organic revenue growth, a mild deceleration from Q2-19 organic growth of 24%. Organic revenue growth a year ago was 29%. While organic growth has shown signs of deceleration, the CFO on the call said she believes the company can continue to grow revenue 20-30% into 2020.SourceMental health visits continue to be a primary growth driver for the company. Mental health visits in the quarter grew 50% yoy and the company says 80% of its mental health visits are from repeat users.The positives in the quarter led to raised full year guidance for both revenue and total visits. The company expects revenue to be at least $546 million vs. the previous guidance of at least $538 million. Total visits should be at least 3.9 million vs. the previous estimate of at least 3.7 million. The company still expects to be unprofitable at year's end, with a net loss of at least $1.43 per share.It is difficult to pin a fair value on Teladoc. The company continues to be unprofitable and generates negative free cash flow. It's a growth stock in a fast-growing, but competitive industry.SourceI think the recent UnitedHealth partnership lends further credence to the company's value as a leading telehealth provider. United is the largest private health insurer in the country and it is possible that Teladoc's exposure within the UnitedHealth ecosystem could grow. UnitedHealth's most recent 10-k notes that it contains nearly 50 million members across commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, and international accounts. It's also not inconceivable that Teladoc could be acquired by UnitedHealth one day.But what's a fair price? Teladoc is trading in the top range of its forward price/sales ratio. The stock is up 20% in just the last month and it's fair to say that Teladoc looks like anything but a value play. I bought in the $60s and continue to hold. I view Teladoc as a speculative bet on a leader in quickly emerging market. I can't recommend buying shares at $80. The stock seems to trade with the wind, and any negative news or general market selloff could punish shares to a more reasonable P/S valuation for those willing to make a long-term speculative bet on an industry leader in a growing market.Teladoc continues to build momentum as a leading provider of telehealth services. It might make more sense to wait for a more reasonable valuation, but the long-term momentum appears to be favoring the company."
4316860,105320,2020-01-14T16:29:49-05:00,"Teladoc is acquiring InTouch Health for $600mm.We believe this is an accretive acquisition that opens up more opportunities for Teladoc to serve even more healthcare providers.Positive news continues to flow with Teladoc smashing Q4 revenue forecasts, and we see this momentum continuing into the future.","Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) made an announcement over the weekend that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire InTouch Health, a telehealth enterprise solution company. We believe there are significant synergistic possibilities between the two entities and expect Teladoc to become even more attractive as the go-to-provider of telehealth solutions for healthcare providers. This will likely open up new business channels for the company as well, leading to a potential boost in topline growth. Teladoc's stock price shot up almost 13% on the news of the acquisition and management's update on Q4 2019 results. We believe the run-up in the stock price presents a tough spot for investors to enter into a position right now. Instead, we advise investors to watch the tape closely and look for a pullback in the next month or so before the earnings release, or take up a position leading up to the Q1 2020 earnings release, when the implementation of InTouch Health becomes more apparent.(Source: hitconsultant.net)We first learned about InTouch Health when we were scouting for potential competitors of Teladoc. Although InTouch wasn't a direct competitor of Teladoc, we thought there was potential for it to become a threat due to its acquisition of TruClinic. Through this deal, InTouch became a comprehensive telehealth solution provider that allowed hospitals to seamlessly integrate telehealth into their offerings through a web-based application. Essentially, if you were a hospital that wanted to provide telehealth services to your patients, you could reach out to InTouch to provide that solution. Additionally, with its telehealth devices and Solo by InTouch software platform (where doctors can coordinate appointments, speak to patients, and see medical information all in one platform), we thought the company could enter into the consumer-facing telehealth market by simply acquiring a customer base through a strategic acquisition.Our fear proved to be unnecessary in the end, but Teladoc's management team seemed to have had similar ideas as us in the strategic potential of a company like InTouch Health under Teladoc.(Source: intouchhealth.com)In mid-2017, Teladoc acquired Best Doctors for $440mm at an EV to revenue multiple of 4.4x based on Best Doctors' estimated revenue of +$100mm for the year. In contrast, Teladoc acquired InTouch Health for consideration of $600mm (consisting of $150mm of cash and $450mm in Teladoc shares) at 7.5x revenue based on InTouch Health's 2019 revenue of $80mm. We believe the higher valuation is justified due to two factors: Potential for additional B2B business and the red-hot telehealth market.Best Doctors was a patient-facing healthcare company that allowed patients to get a second opinion on their diagnosis and treatment plan. The company also allowed patients to get a better understanding of their current condition and treatment plan. The acquisition diversified the offerings of Teladoc and opened up a rather niche business for the company. However, we believe the primary reason for the deal and the premium paid was to increase the number of global customers served.On the other hand, InTouch Health opens up the company's business to more B2B transactions and healthcare providers. We believe this could be an indication of the company's interest in working closer with the enterprise solution-side of telehealth since InTouch Health provides an all-in-one solution for hospitals seeking to offer telehealth service to their patients. Healthcare providers may be more inclined to incorporate telehealth if the back-end solution proves to be simple.Furthermore, in addition to the software side of the business, the deal comes with six different telehealth devices. Teladoc has the potential to offer these devices as a package deal to hospitals looking to incorporate telehealth. The company could also sell this part of the company to generate more cash for future acquisitions.Telehealth has continued experiencing explosive growth since Teladoc acquired Best Doctors in mid-2017. A 2019 study by A FAIR Health showed that utilization (and subsequent insurance claims) of telehealth increased by 53% from 2016 to 2017.(Source: A FAIR Health: Healthcare Indicators and Medical Price Index, April 2019, Author presentation)At the same time, telehealth accounted for only 0.11% of all medical claim lines in 2017, with a significant upward trend continuing into the year.(Source: A FAIR Health: Healthcare Indicators and Medical Price Index, April 2019, Author presentation)Considering the 1.12bn total addressable market for general medical consultations, the 370mm serviceable addressable market for telehealth consultations indicates a 33% market penetration potential. Yet, only a fraction of this market has been addressed. We urge investors to read our first article on Teladoc to get a better idea of this potential.(Sources: Centers for Disease Control, Teladoc's presentation for 36th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, Author estimates)This growing popularity and the disconnect between market potential and the current state of the healthcare system present a significant opportunity for healthcare providers to become involved in telehealth. In a time when convenience and cost play significant roles in healthcare access, healthcare providers must also provide telehealth service as part of their comprehensive care in order to stay competitive. Accordingly, the favorable tailwind of the industry comes with a premium that we believe is justified. The 7.5x multiple could prove to be a steal in a few years as the market matures.CEO Jason Gorevic had a chance to discuss Teladoc's Q4 topline financial results and recent acquisition on Monday's J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. He explained that Q4 revenue is expected to be between $155mm and $156mm vs. forecast of $149mm and $153mm. The beat was the result of increased visit revenue from higher-than-expected visit volume, primarily attributed to one of the biggest flu seasons for the company. The other part of the equation was due to strong subscription revenue from D2C channels.Teladoc saw strong demand from all of its customers, with booking up 30% YoY and average and median deal size up YoY as well. Visit volume was above the high end of guidance at over 1.2mm visits for the quarter. For the full year, Teladoc saw over 4.1mm visits. Teladoc is also expanding services for Aetna.Regarding the acquisition, InTouch Health has similar margins as Teladoc in the mid-60s. About 70% of its revenue is recurring, with ~30% of revenue coming from hardware and devices sold/leased to healthcare providers and ~70% of revenue coming from software. InTouch also generates a small part of the revenue from outsourcing neurologists and psychiatrists to 4 hospitals.Gorevic sees growth opportunities not only from increasing utilization but from existing clients with growth opportunities of over 75mm people. Just within the US, Teladoc has 190mm people available outside of existing clients to convert to the Teladoc platform.Regarding new products, Teladoc saw positive results from their incorporation. Adding new products into the mix for existing customers led to a 30% increase in PEPM. Utilization also grew as well.Overall, we view the acquisition as a net positive for both companies, and the timing makes sense when looking at the explosive growth of telehealth. We currently see InTouch customers benefiting from the existing network of doctors Teladoc brings to the table. On the other hand, Teladoc's business could thrive as more healthcare providers start providing telehealth due to the seamless back-end integration that the combined entities could provide. Additionally, the telehealth devices of InTouch Health could prove to be either an accretive solution that grows topline growth or a potential source of cash through a sale. At the same time, we see a potential short-term risk in the integration of InTouch Health into Teladoc's existing system of care. The problem will likely be minor but may need some time to be fully ironed out. As mentioned earlier, the run-up in the stock price has been significant in the past year, and we urge investors to proceed with caution when deciding an entry point."
4292034,104225,2019-09-18T09:15:00-04:00,TDOC is a provider of telemedicine services and has exhibited impressive growth over the past several years.Share price has seen weakness over the past year due to media distractions which we consider white noise.Adoption of telemedicine services remains strong and the company has multiple tailwinds that can supplement growth.Several growth vectors are available to the company that are currently not being accounted for in the share price.Fear of increasing competition is unfounded as TDOC has a significant leadership position and a clear competitive advantage.,"This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ subscribers, who also got 7 days' exclusive access to Value Alpha’s original Top Idea on Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC). Find out more about PRO+ hereSeeking Alpha: Can you briefly summarize your bullish thesis for readers who may not have seen it yet?Value Alpha: TDOC is a provider of telemedicine services and the largest player in this space by a distance. The company has posted impressive growth in recent years, ramping up very rapidly to 27 million subscribers. After an impressive run in share price over the last few years, price has fallen recently due to media distractions that we consider white noise. The company has a clear leadership position and distinct competitive advantage over new entrants due to its scale and customer relationships with the largest providers of health insurance in the US. The telemedicine market is still very underpenetrated with lots of room to grow. The company has several growth vectors to tap into and our calculation of the current share price shows that the market is not taking these into account. We think shares have a 40% upside.SA: The short interest is relatively high at ~30% - is short covering a potential source of upside? What do you think will be the catalysts to cause the shorts to re-evaluate their thesis?VA: We believe that with growth stocks that are still to turn a profit (TDOC is very close), it's very easy for a negative perception to be created at the sign of any unfavorable news. We certainly think short covering will be a potential upside as the company continues its solid performance. The key catalysts will be the continued subscriber growth, especially if the expansion into Medicare-insured population pans out. Other catalysts could include announcements around RFP wins. The company has already noted an increase in RFPs coming its way in recent months.SA: How do you evaluate whether allegations made by short sellers (such as in this case) are legitimate or not? What do you think the likely outcome is re the BetterHelp subsidiary?VA: The short seller allegations related to questionable sales practices related to the company paying YouTube stars for referrals. The short seller predicted that the company's sales will soon fall due to some negative customer reactions posted on YouTube in response to sponsored videos. Firstly, paying YouTube stars for referrals is not uncommon so that addresses any concerns around illegalities/immoral practices. Secondly, without even going into whether these allegations are true or not, BetterHelp is a small part of TDOC's business and only 5% of BetterHelp subscriber growth comes from YouTube, meaning that it is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the company's overall prospects.SA: What are the key growth drivers of telemedicine in general? What are your responses to critics of telemedicine?VA: The main growth driver for telemedicine is very simple. The North America population is aging and healthcare costs are increasing rapidly. Therefore, any innovation that allows for better health outcomes while addressing costs will be adopted rapidly and will have the support of all the players in the healthcare ecosystem (i.e., providers and payors). As noted in the article, our estimates show that only 12% of the US market is currently using telemedicine and this doesn't even include the massive international scope for these services. The main critique of telemedicine is that it is not as effective in treating issues as a physical visit to the doctor. Although this may be true in some cases (i.e., more complex situations), there are a significant portion of visits to doctor's offices that can be treated via telemedicine. For example, in a remote community, if someone wants to re-fill their diabetes prescription in the evening, they may have to go to a hospital emergency room. This can take a lot of time for the patient and a cost burden on the entire system. This is a clear example of a medical visit that can be handled via telemedicine in very little time.SA: You note that currently half of its business is from call centers – do you see web/mobile gaining share and if so, what is the time frame for this? How would this impact margins?VA: I think the mix of interaction with end users is shifting towards web/mobile in all areas and telemedicine is no exception. Our theory is that this mix will shift fairly rapidly; however, it's challenging to define an exact time frame. Our view is that this will have a favorable impact on margins as it's generally cheaper to interact via internet compared to over the phone; however, the magnitude will likely not be significant.***Thanks to Value Alpha for the interview.

4285577,83086,2019-08-15T09:00:00-04:00,"Teladoc frequently touts its relationships with blue chip insurers but never mentions its relationship with HIIQ, a controversial insurance broker that has been linked to alleged scam artists.For the first time, HIIQ provided revenue concentration disclosure on Teladoc (14% of 1H19 revenues), yet in April 2019, Teladoc told Washington insurance investigators that HIIQ pays revenues to TDOC.It is unusual that both Teladoc and HIIQ claim to be one another’s customers; given HIIQ’s 10Q disclosure, we think Teladoc’s new CFO Mala Murthy should provide more clarity.This report lays out our analysis of the relationship; we believe that TDOC will earn ~70% of 2019E EBITDA from HIIQ, and HIIQ ~30% of 2019E EBITDA from TDOC.Headline risk surrounding HIIQ is high; with TDOC now on the receiving end of HIIQ-investigative inquiries, we believe Teladoc may walk, which could significantly impair cash flow at both companies.","Teladoc (TDOC) shareholders should acquaint themselves with our work on Health Insurance Innovations (HIIQ). On September 28, 2017, we wrote about a Health Insurance Innovations (NYSE:HII) broker named Steven Dorfman who we argued at the time was HII’s largest broker relationship. Dorfman had well-documented run-ins with the law and with insurance commissioners across the country, yet despite our story and these very public allegations, HII continued to do business with Dorfman all the way until November 2018 when the FTC brought an action against Dorfman.We are not going to focus this report on HIIQ or its business practices. However, as we introduce Teladoc shareholders to Teladoc’s relationship with HII, we do think it is important for readers to fully understand that Dorfman’s problems were readily apparent to any party exercising a reasonable duty of care. Despite irrefutable evidence of Dorfman entities being involved in questionable activities that emerged as early as July 2017, including being labeled a “scam artist” by the Nebraska AG, HII continued its business relationship with Dorfman all the way until November 2018 and only cut off its relationship after the FTC brought formal action against Dorfman.Teladoc has been embroiled in scandal after scandal with the ouster of its CFO, lawsuits alleging that its management engaged in insider trading, and a messy NCQA recertification. As a result, we believe that Teladoc is unlikely to want to get pulled into additional drama resulting from its relationship with HIIQ, a company that has been the subject of much scorn. Additionally, from a public records act request, we also discovered that Teladoc recently faced questions regarding its relationship with HIIQ from the Office of Insurance Commissioner of the State of Washington (see excerpts later). Teladoc is also mentioned repeatedly in scripts that came out of the FTC investigation into Dorfman (see later), and a former HIIQ broker we spoke with indicated that HIIQ’s ability to leverage Teladoc’s name is a key selling point in broker pitches.We find it remarkable that Teladoc, a $5 billion firm that received center stage at JPM’s 2019 Healthcare Conference, would be tied to HIIQ, a company known to employ aggressive telemarketing tactics to push insurance policies that have drawn regulatory ire. Yet, not only does Teladoc have ties with HIIQ, but we now believe these ties are likely economically significant. Given the controversy surrounding HIIQ, and the fact that Teladoc is now being drawn into regulatory inquiries relating to HIIQ, we believe that Teladoc should be providing the market with more information regarding the extent of its relationship with HIIQ.Through HIIQ, Teladoc offers a plan that, as we understand it, generates about $9.99 per policy per month in revenues for Teladoc. In researching this article, we spoke with a former HIIQ broker who is intimately familiar with HIIQ’s revenue splits. He explained to us that Teladoc offers an all-you-can-eat plan that costs about $9.99 per month and that this is the specific plan HIIQ sells alongside its STM and indemnity policies. We also confirmed this broker’s claim by reviewing Teladoc policies sold on AgileHealth (HIIQ’s owned website) which appear to be priced at a level that generates no excess fee income for HIIQ and is the same all-you-can-eat plan that the broker described to us. Using common sense, if Teladoc generates $9.99 per month in revenues from these plans, it generates about $120 a year, which, assuming a $50 per visit fee cost, would give Teladoc plenty of margin in this all-you-can-eat setup (as a reminder, in an all-you-can-eat plan, Teladoc bears the cost of visits).Notably, while HIIQ appears to sell the all-you-can-eat Teladoc plan with no markup on its own website, we have confirmed through a review of the FTC action involving Dorfman as well as through conversations with brokers that HIIQ marks these plans up when selling them through third party brokers – charging either $19.99 or $29.99 per month depending on the targeted price point of the bundles. We point this out because HIIQ is effectively charging a 100-200% markup to “standard MSRP” for an identical Teladoc plan when the plan is sold through a brokered channel. The former HIIQ broker further told us that almost all HIIQ plans sold via broker price Teladoc at the $29.99 per month because the $19.99 plan is attached to only the lowest cost HIIQ insurance offering which he believed was likely less than 10% of HIIQ’s overall policy sales. So long story short, we believe that Teladoc plans sold via HIIQ are a) all-you-can-eat and b) largely priced at $29.99 per month at the consumer level, particularly if sold via broker.Source: Izor and Hale v. Health Insurance Innovations et al, underlining was in the original lawsuit imageHIIQ heavily relies on third party brokers (~80%+ of sales). Our story from 2017 sheds more light on the nature of these brokers, but long story short, third party brokers act as a outsourced salesforce for HIIQ and dial for dollars, hunting down prospective customers who they then sell via phone calls. These brokers get a cut of the monthly premium payments that they sign up, including a cut of Teladoc services.In the case of plans sold via broker, we have confirmed through our conversations with the former broker source that HIIQ pays out a flat $7.50 commission per month per plan to the broker of record on the policy sale. With this information in hand, we were able to put together analysis that arrives at the potential economic value of these policies to both Teladoc and HIIQ’s bottom line. See below:Source: Our analysis, based in part on HIIQ and Teladoc disclosures and in part on conversations with a former HIIQ brokerUsing HIIQ’s 2Q19 disclosure and our learnings from speaking with a former HIIQ broker, we believe that in 2019 HIIQ will generate around $25 million in EBITDA from its Teladoc relationship (~33% of projected 2019 EBITDA) and we believe that Teladoc will generate around $21 million in EBITDA from its HIIQ relationship (~71% of projected 2019 EBITDA).Based on our analysis, we therefore believe that both companies are highly intertwined and reliant upon one another. We believe that if either party walked from this relationship, the impact to cash flow at both companies could be significant.First, as we already noted, HIIQ is significantly marking up Teladoc policies – charging 100-200% markups relative to standard pricing when sold via a HIIQ broker. We think this practice, viewed in light of the controversy surrounding HIIQ, makes for potential headline risk for Teladoc down the line.Furthermore, we note that Teladoc has in fact been drawn into regulatory inquiries relating to HIIQ. For example, in an investigation out of Washington state from 2019, a Teladoc representative was asked to provide the Office of Insurance Commissioner with additional data about its ties to HII:Source: Public Records Request, State of Washington, Office of Insurance Commissioner, Legal Affairs Division, Regulatory Investigations Unit, Case No. 1593742The aforementioned disclosure from Teladoc is notable for a few reasons. It is clear that Teladoc is facing some degree of scrutiny relating to its relationship with HIIQ. This is evidenced above and also evidenced in a lawsuit that was filed earlier this year in which attorney the plaintiff (represented by an attorney known for TCPA cases) claimed Teladoc ""benefits directly from the illegal telemarketing employed by HII and its brokerages"".Source: Izor et al v Health Insurance Innovations et alAs we reviewed the FTC complaint against Dorfman (here), we also discovered that Teladoc (incorrectly misspelled as ‘Teledoc’ within the docket which is notably the same misspelling contained in HIIQ’s recent 10Q filing) was a key component of Dorfman’s selling script for his agents. For example, in a script retrieved during an FTC on-site visit to Dorfman’s office, the following text emerged.This is the original complaint:This is an excerpt from a motion from within the same docket:Source: FTC v. Simple Health, Docket #116 Exhibit 7We suggest readers review Exhibit 7 of Docket #116 above on their own, as there are numerous examples of Dorfman’s agents pushing Teladoc.One thing remains a bit of a mystery. As we already noted, HIIQ disclosed Teladoc as a 14% revenue contributor in 1H19. Based on HIIQ’s disclosures, it actually treats Teladoc as a “carrier” – lumping it alongside insurers such as Chubb in its revenue concentration disclosures. Teladoc, on the other hand, has never disclosed HIIQ as a significant customer in its securities filings.Despite this, in its response to the Washington state insurance investigators, Teladoc told the investigators that HIIQ pays Teladoc $0.67 per month per eligible member. See below for an email reply from a Teladoc representative to the Washington insurance investigators:Source: Public Records Request, State of Washington, Office of Insurance Commissioner, Legal Affairs Division, Regulatory Investigations Unit, Case No. 1593742People familiar with Teladoc’s economics will likely recognize the $0.67 per month per eligible member appears to be a form of a PMPM fee. This is of course surprising because Teladoc plans sold via HIIQ are all-you-can-eat plans, which, in our view, do not carry a PMPM in the traditional sense. Teladoc plans that include PMPM fees tend to involve a separate per visit fee that is incurred by patients each time they talk to a Teladoc doctor. Yet in response to Washington investigators, Teladoc appears to present its plans with HIIQ as traditional PMPM plans in which HIIQ is functioning as the insurer paying a PMPM on behalf of its customers.On one hand, HIIQ presents Teladoc as a significant source of revenue – which, effectively implies Teladoc is a customer of HIIQ. However, on the other hand, Teladoc has indicated that HIIQ is in fact a source of Teladoc revenues, which implies that HIIQ is a customer of Teladoc. While it is not unheard of, it is rather unusual for two companies to simultaneously claim that the other is a customer.Again, through our conversations with a former HIIQ broker, we believe we have figured the puzzle out and again believe that Teladoc ultimately owes shareholders greater disclosure about the nature of the relationship between Teladoc and HIIQ.Our understanding of the economic dynamic is as follows. HIIQ technically collects gross receipts from customers but not all of these gross receipts belong to HIIQ. HIIQ is a third party administrator – its job is to collect payments and then remit them via waterfall to the third parties they properly belong to, keeping the residual as their own margin. In the case of a Teladoc policy, HIIQ sends $7.50 to the broker of record, sends $9.99 to Teladoc, and then keeps whatever is left over for itself. As a result, HIIQ only books the commissions it earns as well as the commissions it needs to eventually pay to third party brokers as “revenues”. However, given that Teladoc is the firm that has the ultimate obligation to provide the service that generates said revenue, HIIQ appears to consider these sales as a Teladoc generated sales (this treatment makes perfect sense to us).Teladoc on the other hand is simply earning $9.99 per month per policy sold via HIIQ. What we can therefore gather from Teladoc’s reply to Washington investigators is that Teladoc has decided to parse that payment stream of $9.99 per month into two distinct buckets – a $0.67 per member per month fee that it ascribes to HIIQ as a payment from HIIQ to Teladoc, and then the balance presumably as per visit fees that are presumably ascribed to the underlying customer of record. We note that we tried to sign up for a Teladoc plan via AgileHealth using a Washington state zip code and were offered the $9.95 all-you-can-eat Teladoc plan. Clearly, if all Teladoc earned on these policies was $0.67 per member per month, Teladoc would have an extremely hard time making money on an all-you-can-eat plan – even one visit would turn the economics massively upside down. We therefore do not believe that $0.67 per month represents the full economics that Teladoc earns from policies sold via HIIQ. We remain convinced that Teladoc earns a full $9.99 per month, and is simply allocating a portion of that revenue stream to an arbitrary PMPM paid via HIIQ, and the balance as visit fees paid directly via the customer.We are not sure why Teladoc decided to treat the policies this way, but the result of this treatment is that Teladoc views HIIQ as a very small contributor to its revenues – booking only a $0.67 per member per month fee directly from HIIQ. This would explain why HIIQ is not disclosed as a significant Teladoc customer. From Teladoc’s perspective, it only considers HIIQ a source of revenue for the PMPM portion of its customer base. Of course, this accounting treatment leaves aside that the actual economics of HIIQ-linked Teladoc customers is far higher than simple $0.67 per member per month because they are paying in $9.99 per month to Teladoc for all-you-can-eat plans. We also understand from speaking with the former HIIQ broker that Teladoc plan utilization within the HIIQ user base is extremely low (in our analysis we generously assumed a utilization rate of 10% but our understanding is that it is far lower than the 10% level).We expect we have properly bored readers with the aforementioned analysis. Had Teladoc provided clearer disclosures to the market, this guessing game would be unnecessary. But let’s make matters simple for everyone. We know that HIIQ sells Teladoc on effectively almost all of its policies and that it charges $29.99 per month in the vast majority of cases. We know that the broker of record gets $7.50 per month off the top. We find it impossible to believe that Teladoc is only making a measly $0.67 per member per month from those policies as it would therefore suggest that HIIQ is making money hand over fist via the sale of a Teladoc policy – a policy in which Teladoc bears all the utilization risk. Obviously Teladoc would have to be crazy to enter such an arrangement. We know that the Teladoc policies sold by HIIQ are generally priced by Teladoc at $9.99 per month. We therefore have a hard time believing Teladoc generates anything less than $9.99 per month from the policies sold via HIIQ.Here is the remarkable point. If we assume for a moment that most of the Teladoc policies sold via HIIQ are priced at $29.99 per month, then the actual gross collections HIIQ is making via Teladoc policies could be as high as $60 million (assuming ~180,000 lives at HIIQ). Given the distribution relationship, Teladoc is not actually booking these gross revenues. However, if Teladoc was to book that gross collection at the Teladoc level and was to treat the entire payment as a consideration from HIIQ, HIIQ would appear as a >10% customer for Teladoc which would be sure to raise eyebrows. Instead, Teladoc appears to book the net revenues stemming from this relationship. Further, Teladoc appears to split up the net revenues between a $0.67 PMPM payment that it treats as a HIIQ consideration, and separately some form of visit fee that it appears to recognize as an underlying customer consideration. The impact of this accounting treatment is that we believe HIIQ-linked revenues are flowing through Teladoc’s P&L at an extremely high margin given that we a) understand the HIIQ-linked business has nearly no utilization, and b) do not believe that Teladoc is allocating any distribution costs to the HIIQ-linked business by virtue of booking what appears to be net revenues. This is notable because Teladoc’s gross margins have been steadily falling for the past few years. If our understanding is accurate, this would mean that the HIIQ business is creating a significant lift to Teladoc’s overall gross margins.So we return to our earlier analysis. It appears to us that Teladoc is likely to generate ~70% of its 2019E EBITDA from HIIQ-linked sales. Any Teladoc bull who views Teladoc as some form of high-quality SaaS company should perhaps take a peek at the multiple HIIQ trades at and ask themselves what that cash flow stream is worth.And HIIQ bulls should ask themselves a simple question – what gives them comfort that Teladoc won’t walk? Teladoc has been engulfed in scandal and HIIQ is hardly the poster child for strong corporate governance. HIIQ’s woes are well-known and its decision to markup Teladoc policies by 100-200% and sell them through questionable brokers may ultimately result in Teladoc walking.Given HIIQ’s high leverage, anemic 1H19 cash flow generation, and precarious business model, if Teladoc walks we believe the company will have a difficult time servicing its debt load. HIIQ could find an alternative telemedicine provider, of course, but the economics may be less lucrative if HIIQ is negotiating from a weaker position. And in the case of Teladoc, we believe that the company may ultimately walk from this relationship due to the headline risk, which would have a somewhat material impact on Teladoc’s revenue but would more notably leave the company significantly in the hole from a cash flow perspective."

Or are short-sellers right to call out concerns?","Editors' Note: This is the transcript of the podcast we published yesterday. We hope you enjoy this.Daniel Shvartsman: This week on Behind The Idea we look at Teladoc, ticker symbol TDOC. One of the best lines I've heard from an investor in my time with Seeking Alpha goes something like this. When there are a lot of shorts in a name I pay attention closely, because they're smart. And when I find out that they're wrong, I bet big against them. There are a lot of shorts in Teladoc who are skeptical about the company's profitability, growth trajectory and even their ethics. Value Alpha takes the other side of the trade in a recent top idea, arguing the company has a long runway ahead of it. Is this a case where it's worth voting up? We discuss on this since Behind The Idea.Listen to or subscribe to Behind the Idea on these podcast platforms:Welcome to Behind The Idea.

Check it out at seekingalpha.com/proplus. That's P-R-O-P-L-U-S. Mike?MT: Daniel, yet another battle ground and yet another nascent industry. I guess we are sort of taking for granted the technological innovation that's happening below our very feet at this point, and I think maybe we should just take a minute here and appreciate how far our techno dystopia has taken us. And that's -- this should be exciting. Let's be excited.DS: It is exciting. It is exciting. We're talking about not having to go to the doctor, but instead going to the computer to talk to the doctor through the computer, at least that's how I understand it.MT: Talk to a doctor on the phone.DS: But they can't see you.MT: He can't -- he can't see you. You can send them a picture. I think that's they -- I hope with the dermatology at least, that they -- I hope it's not just verbal descriptions, anyway, Teladoc.DS: So I want to just start with quickly Value Alpha makes the argument -- underlying argument, we'll go into more details, but its argument that Teladoc is going to be a market leader in a growing space. 40% upside is available here. The stock has been public for about four to five years, 2015 it came public. Sort of got off to a rocky start, but then I think through 2018 it had a strong bull rise, and then it's kind of been choppy for the last 12 to 14 months or so.I think where I start with this is that, when you think about -- you're looking for articles or ideas to get excited about, companies to excited about in the growth space, and it makes sense to me why this industry would be something unique. Whether or not we can get into competitive advantage and positioning everything else, but it does make sense to me that there's a macro trend here towards cutting out on trips to the doctor, let's say if you just have a cold or if you have things that you just are difficult to come in, you know, you have -- the alternatives are doctors making house calls or home healthcare with a nurse or going into the doctor. And this seems potentially doing your medical consulting or your medical visits as much as you can through the telephone or through video calls or whatever else. It does seem like that would be a cost saver, and potentially a more efficient model.So I guess there's -- that to me is what at the core, this -- it seems to you like it's possible that a company or companies could do -- this does serve a real purpose, it does serve real value. So I guess I start there. What do you think?MT: Yeah. Yeah, I think, there's a strong case to be made that they're shifting consumer preferences around this just, and it's sort of a trend that we've seen since the dotcom, initial dotcom boom, an increasing faith in the ability to conduct business, over the internet or via telecommunications. There was a time when people wouldn't put their credit card information anywhere, give it to anyone over the internet, even big companies, and that has basically completely evaporated and sort of a logical next step is to increasingly trust your health information and to transact even your personal health and well being over the internet. That to me makes sense as a really strong growth opportunity. Whatever business can capture this increasing trust and increasing comfort with conducting health business over the internet is going to do quite well, I think.In terms of the U.S. market, there's a bunch of other -- wherever we can find efficiencies in the complex sort of spider web of the healthcare system. There's a lot of room to profit from capturing those efficiencies. And because of all the attenuated relationships between the recipients of services and providers, there's a lot of, sort of, room to make a lot of money.So on the high level surface I think you have -- and really what the core I think of the Value Alpha thesis is, is that there's a large growth opportunity here. And the consumer trend is heading on the right direction, and on top of that Teladoc seems to be the leader here with a substantial market share and a very aggressive sort of revenue growth strategy. I find both those aspects of the story to be pretty compelling and I think it gets complicated when you look at the sort of mechanics of how Teladoc is executing on it, but in terms of the business being well positioned I'm basically on board with that.DS: So let's look at Teladoc's positioning specifically because I think the author's argument is that they are the leader in the space which seems plausible. And that they have still a significant growth opportunities. The author shares, based on their own work as well as Teladoc's investor presentation, the fact that Teladoc has 70% market share. It's already acquired a few smaller niche players to help support its market share. It has -- in theory only achieved adoption, the author calculates of 22% if you take the commercial market, 12% if you include the government market, and as listeners are sure to know, it sounds like those will combine in the near future.But so there -- it's essentially to me this is essentially a TAM play of they have -- their competitive advantage is not per say their software, even though the author argues it is highly scalable. It's really still just organizing calls. 15% of their calls are video, the rest are calling into a call center or calling through web or mobile.And so the argument is that they will have a strong connection to the physician networks to ensure their customers are actually insurance companies who then offer the services to their end consumers, you and me. And so the argument is that their connections, their sort of intangible relationships with physician specialists and consumers, providers, et cetera, is what is going to make Teladoc stand out. And then they are in the meantime, both showing revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin growth.And so you don't have to -- before we get into the weeds, you don't have to see what the argue -- the argument is essentially that they're going to continue to maintain market leading growth. They'll eventually one way or the other, they'll figure it out on margins. And then they have exciting field and they have major leadership and they will maintain that and thus become profitable.So that's how I understood it.MT: Yeah, and I would go one further -- this isn't explicit, but I think it's a little bit implicit in the argument that the first level understanding of Teladoc is probably closer to the direct to consumer business, which is relatively small in terms of revenue versus these sort of platform presences with insurance providers. So a lot of people know Teladoc through advertising on podcasts or advertising on YouTube, and that's part of one of the legs of our recent bear thesis on Teladoc.But basically, I think that there's an argument to be made here that the business is actually not that well understood in terms of its actual strengths which are the ability to get on these large platforms that provide access to a lot of customers, as well as the physician network, which is probably only -- those two things may actually feed into each other. It's probably harder to get access to these large platforms, if you don't have a strong physician network behind you to offer to the insurance providers. And it's probably also difficult to attract physicians onto your platform if you don't have a strong enough network of potential customers on the other side.So I think, in addition to that thesis of industry strength being relatively strong, I also think that there's maybe some grounds for a sort of market misperception of the business. In terms of the illusion of it being this direct to consumer play, when in fact, it's more this -- I forgot he has a great like seven letter abbreviation that's like B2C2B2C business, which I think is closer to what it actually is.DS: Yeah, I think it -- I think it was B2B2C. So I guess I take that as helping businesses provide services to consumers.MT: How many B2s can you put in before you start to get nervous? I think B2B2C I'm comfortable with. But B2B2B2 --DS: I have to think that's about the -- I think that's about the limit. I think same with DTC, direct-to-consumer like there's -- you could probably do -- you could -- I think five characters.MT: Five B?DS: Five characters.MT: Five characters total, and after that you start to get into trouble.DS: Yeah, I think that's fair. I think that's fair, important point.MT: Okay. So that's the high level thing, and there's not really that much else to discuss and maybe we should just go through real quickly and just look at the assumptions that Value Alpha makes. So he assumes that subscriber growth declines somewhat revenue per visit remains flat. So that's an important point, right, that Teladoc makes money in two separate ways, right? There's a subscription offering and then there's also a per visit offering. And the subscription offering is the major contributor to revenue. And they collect those fees largely up front and no refunds for accrual. So that's a nice aspect of the business, right?And then you go through and like you said, margins start to rationalize in the coming years and even though we're sort of at a cash burning heavy intense investment stage of business right now, Value Alpha goes out and sees a strong positive cash flow growth, emerging and a strong valuation as a result. What do you think, Daniel?DS: So I think the model itself looks more or less plausible. There's one thing I want to interrogate a little bit more with you, as far as the company's positioning. But I will -- and I'll set that aside for a second. But the -- I find that the model itself is plausible. I mean, I don't think the subscriber growth is that aggressive, as you pointed out, there's not -- there's some increase in utilization paid visits, the author argues, will go up substantially, actually, but still. I'm okay with that as a way to tell the growth story, because I think that's what's interesting to me here is how do you tell a growth story for a stock like this. And so that's plausible, there's some international growth.All -- I'm sure we could debate the revenue numbers here, but the revenue numbers here to me don't seem ridiculous. And even the adjusted EBITDA which is, which the author claims is only adjusted for stock-based compensation, which is its own issue. But that's the 20% adjusted EBITDA in 2023 plausible. So I think that's a plausible spot to be. What I think is more challenging about the model specifically is the final valuation. It's just taken from a terminal revenue model, which I'm not crazy about.I guess the argument you can make for it is that this will still be a growth company, even in 2023. The total revenue growth is perceived to be 14% at that point, margins -- at this point the model has adjusted EBITDA margins. And I'm looking at the bear case actually, I should say. But the bull case -- so if I scroll down to the bull case, the bull case is slightly more aggressive on adjusted EBITDA margins, more aggressive on revenue growth, I think basically driven by even more of a ramp in -- well, there is some pricing there.So look I think, that's a bull case. But it still even the bull case, it still takes the revenue number from 2023 applies a multiple, and then backs into that, if I'm understanding it correctly, backs into that to achieve a share price. And that to me is not super -- that's to me is the weakest part because I -- even if you're saying that it's going to be this great growth company, I think I prefer at that -- if you're projecting the future, I prefer a little bit more of a profit oriented approach, whether it's cash flows or whatever else. And I don't, unless I'm missing something big, I don't really see that this is a DCF or a exit multiple based on EBITDA or anything else.MT: Well, we do just to defend it a little bit. So he's modeling out positive adjusted EBITDA which you could debate or not, but positive adjusted EBITDA margins starting now and increasing over time. So I guess, and this is just sort of a very basic point, but whatever the multiple is on sales, the modeled EBITDA has some margin to sales. And so you could just say, okay, six times sales in the EBITDA margin is 20% then it's 30 times EBITDA.But I guess the point that you're making is just like we need to see some points on something a little bit more bottom line focused. And we want a path towards sort of cash flows and to focus on that, from your perspective. I guess the sales multiple, you might argue is sort of a more speculative way of looking at things, because it's just so focused on the top line. Is that your issue with it?DS: Yeah, I think so. I think it's -- I think, what's going on [indiscernible] to me, that's a pricing mechanism more than a valuation mechanism. And that's -- I always kind of think about that as well, as far as mentions of the short interest. I think it's interesting with these stocks sometimes the pricing gain and are we dealing with trading sardines or are we dealing with eating sardines?And the question of like, this call is working so far. And also you could argue, look, there's a huge short position and if Teladoc, it's a couple quarters right, then the stock -- like you can play that game, then the stock moves and you're happy with it, even if the long term valuation isn't supported or whatever else, that's what -- so that's what I think is -- I feel more comfortable discussing a long term valuation based on -- here's how much money they're going to make either, here's a full discounted cash flow effort, or I'm fine with -- saying, well, here's 15 times free cash flow or earnings.A few years from now and then I'm discounting that back. I'm -- like, I've done that, I think that's okay, but this to me -- well we've discussed potentially sharing some ideas later on the line. And I might share an idea where I do something similar. So stay tuned for that.But yeah, so I -- but so I don't know, I guess because the argument here -- I don't love the valuation, I think that -- I think this is all, how to construct a compelling growth case. The argument is that there's still going to be a lot of room for adoption down the line. The author is -- the author's approach to building in conservatism is to kind of take chunks out of the company's position now, for example, dropping their market share to 60% instead of 70%, et cetera.So I think the author is trying certainly for growth case. From my perspective, there's a lot missing here. And I don't think that this has achieved the feeling for me that there's - this is a super clear growth story, and that this is going to be something really -- that you really want to explore further to try to get it on the ground level for something that could be the next big, loosely tech company winner I guess is how I would feel.MT: Yeah. So you mentioned that you -- that sort of probably ties into whatever you have to say about industry position, which you mentioned that we set aside for a second. So let's get into -- let's talk about that a little bit. What were you going to mention there?DS: Well, so to me, the author expresses a couple times the underlying software is not that special here. And so their market share is all through establishing our relationship with insurance companies. That doesn't -- I guess, here's the trick to me is that and what I'd want to see is a couple things, I think that about that positioning that's problematic, is that I want to see evidence of what the -- what is the TAM going to be ultimately, if this is your play and it has to be kind of a Goldilocks scenario. It can't be too attractive, because for all those relationships, if I use the example of the latest company to pop-up in the news is a potential threat, which listeners will know before I say it.If Amazon comes around, they're already partnering with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway on their own healthcare, like a company like that can figure out how to make relationships with physician networks. That to me doesn't seem -- I want to see more evidence of why Teladoc is actually going to be able to hold on to that, if somebody wants to come in and try to recreate those networks. That to me doesn't sound -- I mean, I don't know if -- I think you actually have medical folks in your family, I've friends in like, the dental world and medical, whatever.I understand that those are fragmented to a large degree. And so there's some opportunity for consolidating and providing services and being the person, who can connect all of them. But I want more evidence that Teladoc is really not just the first mover but the best mover. And so that's I think the one part of the position that's problematic.And then the other revenue multiple to mean makes more sense, if you're arguing, there's acquisition case, which the author doesn't explicitly make. But I'd want to see who would buy them. Or again, like I said, if I don't see that I want to see more of the cash flow approach, but then the challenge with buying them, and then, I guess, sort of the last point, the challenge of buying them is they're working with all these other health insurance companies.So a health insurer can't really buy them, because then it's no longer that sort of neutral platform, provide this it's now an in-house thing at Aetna or UNH or wherever. And so that kind of knocks out a lot of your potential acquirer base. I could be off on that, if somebody else has opinions, e-mail us. And then in the health industry in general and I made as an allusion to what's going on politically, not seriously. But we're trying to cut costs. I can see how this would be a cost cutter, this business. I struggle to see how this would give them a lot of leeway to -- they are losing money right now. So they're not yet making up for it on volume, as it were.And so I don't see yet, -- that's where that Goldilocks issue comes in. If this is so lucrative that if they really do make this land grab as the author says, and keep 60% to 70% of the market, is there going to be profit at the end of the day, that's really worth it, because the adjusted EBITDA number in the bull case is something like -- it was something like $200 million. It might be more, I'm pulling it back up. But it wasn't like, yeah, $211 million in 2023.So we're talking about an EV right now of somewhere around -- EV to EBITDA of somewhere around 25, if I'm doing that, right? Yeah, 25-ish and I think that's generous. So about 25 EV/EBITDA 2023 in a relatively aggressive growth scenario, where -- like, what's the next part of goal? Where does the rainbow end what does that look like? And it's -- like I said, if it's super attractive, then Apple is interested in health. I'm just thinking big tech companies. I'm sure they're going to be other companies that are looking at this and saying, we can get it on this. This is an attractive opportunity. And if your moat is just physician networks, that doesn't seem as strong to me as a better software or a better model or whatever else. So I don't know that -- those are my concerns, I've rambled a little.MT: No, no, that's -- yeah, I think we -- yeah. There's something to that. I wonder if it's just presence on the platform, insurance companies not being reputed to be very quick to shift gears. At least that's my perception, although we've seen them add and drop various drugs and other things from coverage with I think relative ease and that's to the surprise of certain companies that are providing those elements. So maybe being a first mover here is not all that great of an advantage, especially given the types of potential rivals from the larger side of -- the Amazon's, Apples of the world.I also think it's interesting that, some of their growth is inorganic. They're purchasing other companies, they -- in 2018, they purchased a French company. I believe in 2018 and they purchased another sort of tele-medicine company recently. And those are meaningful, not overwhelming contributors to the growth story. I think 15 percentage points of growth to the medicine direct, somewhere around there.So, meanwhile on -- I think that my general point here is I think the story isn't necessarily as clean as I would like to just go from a top line perspective and slap a sales multiple or even a 2023, adjusted EBITDA multiple on this company. I went through their most recent 10-Q and I saw some sort of interesting quirks to what's going on. They have ownership or they have this variable interest entity, which is Teladoc's physicians PA, which is an association of physicians, who provide services to Teladoc.And so Teladoc has control over this variable interest entity that provides services to it. That's a kind of related party relationship that complicates the story to me, especially when you're talking about sales growth. I'm not saying one way or another that that's a negative here, but it is something that's disclosed prominently in the 10-Q and would deserve some additional scrutiny.Beyond that, you have some interesting dynamics going on in terms of capital market transactions. So in conjunction with the purchase of medicine director, this U.S. based target company, right around the same time, Teladoc issued shares at about a 13 times sales, multiple and current run rate revenue for the target company, put the sales multiple for the acquisition at about 6x.So it's interesting to me that you have a little bit of -- I wouldn't call it a full roll up dynamic, because there does seem to be organic growth happening at the same time. But there is some aspect of this where the company is issuing stock at a really generous multiple to purchase sort of fringe competitors or smaller competitors at multiples that are much smaller. And I think when you have that kind of capital markets arbitrage dynamic going on, that's not necessarily encouraging to me for the growth story overall.Obviously, that's not the sum total what's going on. The other thing that caught my eye was some convertible notes issuance and the fact that this company then does carry debt on the balance sheet and its net cash position is actually closer to zero than I would have expected for a company like this. All of which is to say that skating along the surface on -- and looking at management's presentation of historical performance, as well as where the company is going in the future, this is such an execution driven story that I think to buy into the type of optimistic growth story, the Value Alpha's telling here, I'd want a little bit less hair on what I'm seeing just at a glance from the filings. So those are the things that sort of caught my eye. And I think I would have to do a lot more work to be convinced that everything is great.And maybe that's kind of a segue into Value Alpha does give a treatment of a bear thesis that was published on Seeking Alpha by another strong contributor named the Friendly Bear that was accompanied with some sell off and certainly since that time, the stock has not had the same sort of meteoric rises it had happened in the past. So what do you think of the treatment of the bear thesis here and Value Alpha's idea?DS: I think it's not complete is how I would put it. I think there's -- I think the author reduced the short selling argument to basically one component, which is what you referred to earlier about YouTube referrals to Teladoc. And I think it's -- and then also mentioned some issues with the CFO and CEO and certain things there, which I'm sympathetic to the argument there. I noted as I was working that there were some issues with the SEC, it seemed like relatively trivial ones, but around the reporting. So the CFO is nice to have sometimes for that.But the -- I think where I raised an eyebrow here, I think there's a lot more to the short selling argument. It could be not -- it could still be painted with the same brush. But I think, as you pointed out, given the hair here, it's probably worth. Because I think the broader issue that I take from the various concerns that Friendly Bear and anybody else who's raised concerns about Teladoc beyond the valuation, it's things like trying to do mental health over the phone or over the video like is -- it leads to some fraught territory.And there's some -- like this is to your point earlier about dystopian world and you think of all the externalities out of what seemed like trivial usages, like Facebook, like Google where it's sort of clear. I'm doing this to get information or I'm doing this to share information with my friends or whatever, like there's a more clean interaction.In this case, there is a medical. It's not even the data. I'm not getting into that can of worms, but like that sensitive stuff, and you want to really get it right, and you want to make sure that everything is buttoned up. And I think that's what the friendly bear has been raising in so many words in their arguments is these concerns over this company's pursuing growth without necessarily building in the fully effective way that you need to -- in a industry like the healthcare industry.And I don't think that was addressed here. And I don't think it was even sort of given consideration which again to me, I can I can see the argument that, that actually is wrong, but I'd want to see that in the article and I don't see that.MT: Yeah, I think, you make an interesting point, that the specifics of the Friendly Bear argument, I think are in hindsight debatable whether the Friendly Bear was kind of overplaying or overly focused on some scandals that were meaningful, certainly to the people affected, but not potentially business destroying type of issues. If we take this as this a fast growing company, a startup or a company that's trying to capture market share very quickly, and pioneering in some ways, a pretty novel customer experience, doing things over the phone with physicians, they have -- that's a risky undertaking, and you're going to have some issues arise as you go through it.So maybe some of these things are to be expected. In terms of the YouTube Stars sort of plugging Teladoc on social media, I think if anything, the company has weathered that Better Health storm recently on more sort of a celebrity, like Conan O'Brien is advertising Better Health on his podcast. And so I think that whatever was going on there, I don't think that it's affected public perception enough that popular and people with large audiences and a fair amount of respect among the sort of entertainment consuming public have not distanced themselves from Better Health, as a result of that scandal, and therefore, the brand has not taken a sufficient hit relative to what Friendly Bear was going after.So that specific instance probably didn't play out. But the broader issue, which I think is sort of to your point of trust in this business, and the ability to execute on this aggressive growth story, I think that there are still some questions about that, and I don't think that those have entirely been put to rest.DS: Well, I go back to what you just said before that about this being an execution based story, which I think is really astute, and I think is worth thinking about with growth stories, because we -- I'm going to go back into our archives a little bit. I think about Shopify (SHOP), for example, which we talked about ad nauseam last summer 2018, when it was in the hundreds and now it's around 400. And that appears to be truly an execution driven story and it's still a high multiple, but they seem to be hitting their marks, right? And…MT: And we weren't bullish.DS: No.MT: We were in the skeptical.DS: Yeah.MT: It's just disappointing.DS: Well, no. We got one wrong. But no, I think that's actually the exact point is that -- because you look, the comments on Seeking Alpha are quite bullish and there are the strong revenue numbers and there is -- and this is an exciting industry, because I think it genuinely can change things and it can help people like those are all good things. I'm also reminded of Trupanion (TRUP), which we covered this year and which we were also I think bearish on and which hasn't done that well, so we don't get them all wrong. But the…MT: Still a little defensive there.DS: But it's the story. It's like execution stories can work, and you can be right. And that's fine and congratulations if you can genuinely identify that as an execution story, then you even may have gotten the process, right. But it's sometimes -- there's sometimes this sort of retroactive, oh, I knew that was going to happen or I totally nailed it or whatever it like there's this sort of credit that people will take, when it's just a bet that you got right and that's fine that you got it right. As long as you know what the bet was, and you can understand how to replicate or avoid extrapolating too much whatever else. But I think that's what's -- I think the execution based story is really interesting.And I think I don't see enough evidence of Teladoc's execution, nor of the -- I think the concerns that short sellers have raised and also just the things we've talked about, I would have liked to see those addressed to make the case that, yeah, actually, this really is a different game. This is not to use a theme from recent times, this is not the startup WeWork sort of playbook of revenue, revenue, revenue, and then we'll figure it out, but that there's something underlying.And I should say they're not burning a ton of cash, they're relatively close to break even on just the free cash flow metric. That's mainly because they are amortizing a lot, which is I think, from their acquisitions, and they are paying -- they're diluting shares shareholders quite rapidly through share based compensation. So those are your two sort of things to watch for. But I think we've sort of circled around growth stories a lot over our time. And it's just -- to me what you need to -- there are going to be execution driven stories that work. But I think to say that you called it and got it right, I think you need a full case for why that's going to be the play. And I think we're a few pieces short of that here, is sort of how I feel.MT: Yeah. And just on that note, I think that the acquisitions, I'm not convinced that you see that disappearing over time. I wonder whether acquisition purchases and therefore amortization appreciation, there's a lot of goodwill on the balance sheet. And I'm not sure that that's something that you can sort of discount when you're evaluating free cash flow. So I have some concerns there. I also -- growth is tapering off on the top line, which is -- I mean eventually has to do, but I would be concerned about that.I also just want to run one thing quickly by you, Daniel that I thought was -caught my eye in that stronger 10-Q, I'm sorry here we go, you might want to get a pad and paper. But we completed approximately 908,000 visits representing $19 million visit fees for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 533,000 visits representing $14.8 million of visit fees during the quarter ended June 30, 2018; an increase of $4.2 million or 29%.So doubled or like a 40%, 45% increase in visits with a 33% increase in visit fees. So yeah, they grew the fees 29%, but if you divide the 19 million in 2019, visit fees by the number of visits, you get an average of about $20 per visit fee. And that's lower than the average fee per visit for 2018. So they're growing the number of visits faster than they're growing the rate of fee revenue. So I wonder if -- I think that there, that's not the main driver of the business necessarily, but I did think it was interesting to see that type of decline in the amount paid per visit.I guess maybe that's greater utilization among subscribers, but I don't know. That would that would call into question potentially the margins going forward, which are quite attractive on -- just on a gross margin basis they are around 60% or something and as a gross margins guy, that's something you like to see. But yeah, I think that the things that were great about this article were -- look, it's a -- the market doesn't fully appreciate the way that this business works and doesn't fully appreciate necessarily the nature of the competitive advantage that's available here. And if growth continues in a reasonable trajectory, and there are a lot of tailwinds here, then investor could do quite well. I think that on a full, thorough due diligence basis, there's more complexity to the story than I'm comfortable with.DS: Yeah, I don't know. I would say from the other side for the short case, you -- I'm leery of cases where you have had -- the Friendly Bear's not the only short, who's come out on Seeking Alpha. And I'm sure there's others out there. Like, I'm a little leery of getting into that without a hard catalyst. So we're not researching it from that angle. I think what you spotted in terms of visit -- average visit fees is really good, but again, it could be -- that's one data point, we're not yet clear how that fits in full picture. But yeah, I think from the long side, and maybe the last thing I'll just kind of slip in and again, you could argue this is conservatism. But this is all for 40% upside play.I think, I would -- I tend to -- if I'm looking for a growth play. I'm looking for about 50. If I'm looking for an opportunity I am looking for 50% ups, margin of safety or whatever. But I think, I would again -- I'd want to see like what is -- I -- the author I think would argue that there's a lot of conservatism baked in, et cetera. But it does seem like there's a lot left unfilled here to then leave that open, so for only 40%. So I guess that's where I end up.MT: I like when we land there.DS: It's a safe landing point for us.MT: There's not a lot -- yeah. Where's the beef, that's always a good landing point.DS: Well we will see where we are a year from now, I guess. We can always -- the nice thing about the market is…MT: Will be totally lax -- we will be poor -- we will be in the poorhouse.DS: But market will show you where you stand, and even if we don't take positions I should -- we mentioned Google briefly, I'm long Google. But if you don't take positions, then you're still right, we're kind of putting our credibility on the line in terms of our analysis. So we'll see how it plays up.MT: All right. Teladoc, interesting company. I have a couple of friends who use it and like it. Not sure about the business though.DS: Moi non plus, but good stuff.MT: Okay. Mon frere, let's leave it there.DS: All right, take it easy.MT: Bye."
4290820,104225,2019-09-18T08:00:00-04:00,TDOC is a provider of telemedicine services and has exhibited impressive growth over the past several years.Share price has seen weakness over the past year due to media distractions which we consider white noise.Adoption of telemedicine services remains strong and the company has multiple tailwinds that can supplement growth.Several growth vectors are available to the company that are currently not being accounted for in the share price.Fear of increasing competition are unfounded as TDOC has a significant leadership position and a clear competitive advantage.,"Teladoc (TDOC) is a provider of virtual telemedicine services. The company has exhibited impressive growth over the past several years on the back of industry tailwinds and solid execution, leading to expansion in share price reaching a high point of ~$86/sh in 2018 (400% growth since 2017). During Q4 2018, the company was impacted by the general market downturn along with a few media distractions including sale of shares by its CFO and accusations by a short seller around questionable sales practices. We consider these to be white noise (to be explained later). This led to a share price decline of ~40% at one point. In this article, we attempt to establish that the fundamental situation of the company and the market it operates in remains strong. We also present a fundamental view that we think the market is taking when pricing the stock; we believe this view does not account for the multiple growth vectors available to the company. Ultimately, we theorize that the stock is undervalued today with a potential upside of 40%.Source: Yahoo FinanceProducts and ServicesIn simple words, TDOC provides a software that allows users to access a scaled network of medical professionals over their mobile phones from anywhere with an internet connection. The company also provides access to doctors over a traditional land-line, in-fact majority of the patient interactions occur over this mode and this illustrates a very important point around TDOC's competitive edge in this increasingly competitive market: access to medical professionals at scale is of greater importance than the software (NYSE:IP). We will discuss this point in greater detail in the following sections.Teladoc's mode of patient interaction - Source: company reportsMajority of consultations fall in the general medicine category however the company has been increasing its mix of services including mental health, dermatology, sexual health, wellness etc. These additional services provide a compelling up-sell opportunity for the company to its already significant subscriber base especially mental health and wellness services which are gaining increasing awareness in North America.Business Model AnalysisOther HighlightsKey Trends in Healthcare and Impact on Telemedicine AdoptionHealthcare costs are rising and governments, employers and hospitals are faced with pressures to find innovative ways to reduce these costs. For example, the new value based healthcare system which is gaining more traction proposes to penalize hospitals for re-admissions. The company estimates that approximately a third of ambulatory care visits can be handled remotely. This is not hard to see as today's traditional means of getting healthcare require patients to go to the hospital for even non-critical issues. For example in a remote community, if someone wants to re-fill their diabetes prescription in the evening, they may have to go to a hospital emergency room. This can take a lot of time for the patient and a cost burden on the entire system. This is a clear example of a medical visit that can be handled via telemedicine in very little time (note that doctors can prescribe medicine for most treatments on a telemedicine platform; TDOC has the ability to send this prescription directly to a pharmacy of the patient's choice). Mental health consultations are another clear example of a service that does not require physical presence and can easily be handled remotely. This dynamic has led to the explosive adoption of telemedicine and we believe there are many more use cases that will be developed in the futureTelemedicine Market Size and SegmentationThe overall size of the market if we consider all the services and populations that can be served is massive and fairly time consuming to estimate. We will focus our analysis on the immediate market being served by TDOC; namely the US population covered by commercial insurance. We will also briefly talk about the population covered by government programs (Medicare/Medicaid) and the potential international market in developed countries.In the US, ~177M people are covered via commercial insurance. The figure below illustrates the breakdown of health insurance coverage in the country.Insurance coverage (in millions) in the US - Source: company presentationThe importance of establishing relationship with these insurance companies is therefore critical and TDOC's first mover advantage has allowed them to secure partnerships with some of the largest health plans (e.g. UnitedHealth Group, Anthem, Kaiser etc.) which are a significant source of growth. In fact, the top 10 health plans in the US control ~50% market share. Note that these companies also provision the Medicare Advantage plans which are expected to provide telemedicine coverage starting in 2020 as part of their benefits due to regulatory changes.Top health plan's market share in USCompetition AnalysisSomeone having a preliminary look at the telemedicine industry may see the competitive landscape and decide that this is a commoditized service. This would be similar to assuming that there are many cell phone manufacturers and hence Apple and Samsung's global leadership position is under threat. This certainly won't be accurate, in fact, compared to the cell phone industry the telemedicine market has a large white space that the incumbent players like TDOC are poised to capitalize on. Companies with a first mover advantage (TDOC being top of list) have already established significant physician networks and customer relationships which as we mentioned earlier are the biggest source of competitive advantage as these take time to build (the underlying software is not difficult to replicate). Telemedicine is currently in a ""land grab"" dynamic and at most 2 or 3 horse race with the top players controlling vast majority of the market. Based on my research, many of the large insurance companies, health systems and employers that cater to vast majority of US employees either already have telemedicine partnerships or plan to launch RFP's for these services. Teledoc has a first mover advantage and is by far the largest player as illustrated by the graphic below.Source: TDOC presentation; author's researchWe have witnessed many instances of early stage industries maturing and the incumbents capturing vast majority of the market share as adoption increases. Smaller players get squeezed and this leads to market consolidation. This dynamic is already playing out to some extent as evident by the fact that TDOC has acquired 7 companies (few of them listed in the image above). Even if some readers don't prescribe to this view, the calculation below regarding current adoption and potential whitespace should convince you that there is a significant greenfield opportunity for several players to thrive. Note that the calculations below don't even include the international opportunity which I have illustrated separately in the second image below.In millions - Source: company presentation; author calculationUltimately, our view is that the increasing competition is a reflection of the uptick in telemedicine adoption which is an overall positive for this industry.Source: Company presentationWe have already discussed the key sources of competitive advantage for TDOC however the summary below should bring it all together:We believe that none of these events points to a fundamental weakness and have created a compelling opportunity for investors to establish a long position.There are several growth vectors available for Teledoc to continue its impressive expansion to date and our view is that most of these are not currently reflected in the company's stock price (as illustrated in the valuation section).Financial PerformanceThe company has exhibited impressive growth over the past several years. As is the case with early stage technology companies, significant investment is required in the initial stages to scale rapidly which keeps margins low. The chart below illustrates this dynamic with the company now generating positive EBITDA and expected to be cash flow positive in 2019. At scale, TDOC should generate healthy margins given a higher base of recurring revenue and increased efficiency. An example of increased efficiency at scale is that the company can hire dedicated professionals that provide consultations over chat (A physician can conduct multiple chat sessions at the same time whereas as soon as there is a need for a video consult, only 1 patient can be served). The company is also investing a significant amount in R&D which will likely include some element of AI where initial information gathering during a consult can be automated along with a preliminary diagnostic (UK based Babylon Health already has an AI platform).Note: our calculation of adj. EBITDA only excludes stock based compensation. The company also excludes M&A related costs however we have added these back as M&A has been a regular source of growth and expected to continue. Source: company disclosuresCurrent Market View of FundamentalsNow lets get to the crux of our article. We have attempted to model out a view that illustrates a potential fundamental view being baked into TDOC's stock price. As it will be clear with the underlying assumptions listed below, we believe that the market is under appreciating the growth prospects from most of the vectors listed in our previous section. The market appears to be of a view that the company's growth will slow down as a result of increasing competition. Assumptions incorporated in the market forecast:What does this mean in terms of market adoption of telemedicine and remaining white space?As we can see, there would still be significant room to grow in the unpenetrated market. Note that we have dropped TDOC's market share to 60% (vs. the 70% today as illustrated by the image above in the competition section) simply in the interest of adding conservatism to the forecast.Potential Future View with (conservative) Materialization of Growth VectorsOur view is that market adoption for telemedicine will be a lot faster compared to the market view from above. This is evidenced by the company's comments around growth in RFP requests and the future view below is a better representation of the company's prospects. Key deltas in assumptions compared to previous view:How does telemedicine adoption look in this view?Significant room to grow which likely supports a higher exit multiple than what we've used in our valuation.The fundamental situation of TDOC remains strong and the market is not accounting for the multiple growth vectors available to the company. We see meaningful upside to today's share price and investors should look to establish a long position."
4292194,104761,2019-09-18T06:24:38-04:00,"Teladoc is a leader in a growing industry with plenty of runway ahead of it.The company is growing both organically and through acquisitions, though organic growth is slowing and acquisitions have dampened margins.While it is true that Teladoc has several competitors, it has a first-mover advantage and is used by leading health plans, CVS, and many large employers.In 2020, Medicare Advantage plans will be able to pay for telehealth, which will further expand market potential.But the Medicaid opportunity looks much larger and it remains to be seen if Teladoc can capitalize on this market.","Teladoc (TDOC) is an attractive long-term bet on the telehealth industry. The company is not profitable and the stock price is volatile. I started writing this story a couple of weeks ago after the selloff from $70 to $55 and we're already back to $70.There appears to be an undeniable need for remote access to medical care and companies like Teladoc are making it happen. The country is getting older and people, many of whom live in remote areas of the country, need access to the forms of healthcare that don't necessarily need to be delivered in person.While the demographic trends may clearly beckon for greater use of telehealth, it is unclear if Teladoc--or any company--will be a dominant winner in the space. Teladoc has grown aggressively through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth, but that organic growth has been decelerating, and gross margins continue to contract, largely due to lower gross margins of recently acquired companies.While I am interested in Teladoc, I am not a buyer here and will continue to watch from the sidelines.By all accounts, telemedicine is just getting started and companies like Teladoc have barely scratched the surface of meeting the need for remote-access medical care. The company sells its 24/7 on-demand telehealth services directly to businesses and consumers (behavioral health). Business clients (>12,000) include more than 40 health plans, including UnitedHealthcare (UNH), Aetna, several blues plans, and nearly half of the companies in the Fortune 500.Teladoc collects a per-member-per-month fee from the companies that pay for access on behalf of members. This PMPM subscription revenue consistently generates more than 80% of the company's revenue. As of Q2-19, U.S. membership count totaled nearly 27 million. The company also generates revenue on a per-visit basis with some clients that have visit-fee-only plans.In a country of over 300 million people, Teladoc is the leading telehealth vendor in the U.S. with a PMPM user base of just 27 million. A Business Insider market study in 2018 estimated that nearly half of Americans today fall within the addressable market for the types of medical care that can be supported remotely.SourceAnd women, mothers included, are increasingly seeing the benefit of relying on telehealth for non-emergency doctor visits.Why?Convenience:SourceWhile there appears to still be a large, untapped market for telehealth access, much of that potential may be tied to government reimbursement. Approximately 40% of Americans are covered either by Medicare or Medicaid.SourceA 2018 federal budget agreement permitted Medicare Advantage plans to offer telehealth to their members beginning in 2020. This could potentially open the door to similar access for the Medicare Fee-For-Service population. The company has continued to tout its excitement about the Medicare Advantage opportunity, which represents 20 million lives.That said, it is unclear to me why Medicaid--health insurance for the poor and separate from Medicare--at this point isn't playing a larger role in the company's growth. The Medicaid opportunity is >3x the size (72M lives vs. 20M lives) of the Medicare Advantage opportunity. Telehealth is offered to varying degrees depending on the state in question. States have discretion on how to design their own Medicaid programs and how much of role telehealth plays in those programs.Two-thirds of Medicaid MCOs offer some sort of telehealth coverage, and most Medicaid coverage across the country falls under Medicaid MCOs, not FFS. Because of this, I would think that Teladoc would have a stronger footing in Medicaid because of its partnerships with insurers who also have Medicaid MCO divisions. UnitedHealthcare, for example.But Medicaid appears to be a work in progress for Teladoc. The most substantive recent company comment I could find on Medicaid came on the Q3-18 earnings call, and Medicaid hasn't come up on an earnings call since then:Teladoc has a lot of competition. There are other standalone service providers like Teladoc and there are also provider organizations that have developed their own solutions.That said, Teladoc appears to have a first-mover advantage. Teladoc has the widest usage among independent platforms and--like its four closest competitors--has a strong reputation among users, based on ratings from the Apple app store. There are two ways of looking at the below. First, Teladoc is clearly the most popular telehealth app based on the number of user reviews. Second, regardless of app being used, the service quality appears to be comparable across the board, i.e. there is little difference.Source: Apple app storeIn addition to the above competitors, Teladoc has competition in other forms, including health systems that have built their own telehealth solutions.Additionally, the barriers to entry into this industry are low. It remains to be seen if a larger player like Amazon or Google doesn't enter the space. That said, the current regulatory battles shaping up between Washington and the big tech companies will probably dissuade this from happening any time soon.The company is not profitable and has struggled to generate positive free cash flow. These issues are understandable. The company is in growth mode.That said, organic growth has continued to drift downward. It was 24% in the most recent quarter and had been in the high 30% range in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, margins have compressed due to acquisitions. Gross margin this quarter was 69% vs. 71% a year ago. The difference was the result of the company's acquisition of Advance Medical, which carried lower margins than Teladoc.As of this writing, the forward price/sales ratio is at nearly 10, thanks to a recent surge in the stock price from ~$55 to ~$70. It could be argued that Teladoc's strong revenue growth, its strong source of recurring revenue--typically 85% of revenue is recurring--similar to other SaaS companies, and its massive addressable market justify a high P/S ratio. There is a long list of SaaS growth stocks right now that trade at richer premiums than Teladoc.I am not a buyer here. I'd like to see how organic growth rates continue to shake out. I'd also like to develop a better understanding of why Medicaid seems to play such a minor role in the company's growth profile at this point given the massive size of the Medicaid population and the fact that 2/3 of Medicaid MCO health plans offer some sort of telehealth coverage."

The company is a fast grower on the top line, but it's yet to crack break-even profitability metrics. We've published many short ideas on the company on Seeking Alpha, but we recently published a PRO+ top idea by Value Alpha that takes the long side. As with many of these stories, there are both exciting things going on and questions raised that deserve a closer look.We break down the long case, and then we raise our questions.

The growth has not resulted in earnings just yet, but I believe that Teladoc's path to profitability is starting to become clearer.The StoryThere was a lot to like about Teladoc's Q2 2019 results and, after you factor in the company's expanding partnership base, it is hard denying that this small-cap company is well-positioned for the future. It also helps the bull case that management agrees with this assessment.Source: Q2 2019 Earnings PresentationSome pundits viewed management's forward guidance as ""lackluster"" but I believe that it is too early to get worked up over earnings (or lack thereof) because this company is still in full growth mode. To this point, management highlighted during the conference call that the company plans to continue to heavily invest in 2019 in order to support future growth. This means that investors wanting a company that is able to report earnings growth in the near future should start looking elsewhere. It really should have already been known that revenue growth and improving operating metrics are the real story for Teladoc for the time being.At the end of the day, management's full-year 2019 guidance was nothing to write home about, but I still believe that the bull case for Teladoc remains very strong.Teladoc's story is simple: the company is disrupting an industry that needs to be disrupted. The company's suite of services is really starting to catch on, and the recent acquisitions are already bearing fruit. To this point, this company has report strong results over the last few years and there are no real signs of a slowdown coming anytime soon.Source: Company Presentation, Canaccord Genuity's Growth Conference, August 2019Moreover, I believe that Teladoc's growth estimates may turn out to be too low because this company has a significant market opportunity, i.e., a total addressable market that continues to expand. Virtual care is the future, in my mind, and it pays to go with the company that is leading the charge.Source: Company Presentation, Canaccord Genuity's Growth Conference, August 2019I do not believe that the company's most recent results (or guidance) have changed the bull case for this exciting, small-cap company. And to be honest, I believe that the management team actually has a better story to tell now than they did even a few short years ago.After the recent pullback, Teladoc's stock is trading at reasonable levels based on its own historical metrics.Data by YChartsAdditionally, TDOC's shares are trading at a discount when compared to its fair value of almost $68 per share according to Morningstar.Source: MorningstarThe stock is not cheap by any means, but I also do not believe that the potential growth is fully baked into the stock price either.RisksInvesting in small-cap companies comes with many risks, but the major risk for Teladoc is related to the company being outspent by larger competitors. Additionally, the company relies heavily on its partnerships to expand its business, so deteriorating relationships in the industry could have a material impact on Teladoc's business.In addition, integration risk needs to be considered given the numerous acquisitions that have been made over the last few years. And most importantly, regulatory changes have the potential to greatly impact Teladoc's business.Lastly, Teladoc is not the only company operating in the telehealth space (it is actually a very crowded space). While I believe that Teladoc is a clear market leader, management sitting on their hands and not investing in the business (either through acquisitions and/or expanding organically) should be viewed as a major risk factor.The recent pullback for TDOC shares should be viewed as a long-term buying opportunity. The company reported strong Q2 2019 operating results and I believe that management still has a great story to tell. In my opinion, Teladoc is positioned for growth and I view the next few years as the coming out party for this disruptive technology company. Teladoc is definitely not the only telehealth player but I believe that this company is leaps and bounds ahead of its competitors. As such, I view Teladoc as an attractive three to five-year investment at today's price."
4265457,21815,2019-05-21T05:01:01-04:00,"Teladoc is a big player in the rapidly rising virtual care market, which is still in the early innings.The company has multiple growth avenues in front of it, like Medicare Advantage and overseas growth.Cash flow concerns are dwindling, as the business model does contain a fair amount of leverage.There are some latent concerns and there is a big short position, which makes the shares quite volatile.","With increased electronic communication channels come all sorts of opportunities for new business models, one of which is remote diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions, or ""virtual care,"" or telemedicine.Teladoc Health (TDOC) is one of the companies that embarked on this opportunity, and the growth it is experiencing is pretty impressive:Data by YChartsThe revenue growth is substantial, even if in part fueled by acquisitions (for instance, recent acquisitions like Advance Medical and French Medicin Direct).Yet, operationally things are going south, at least in GAAP figures, and this might be one reason that the company attracts short-sellers, with the short count standing at 30%+ of the float.However, adjusted figures stripping out share-based compensation and amortization are considerably better, with adjusted EBITDA actually turning in a small positive in Q1.The company has two main sources of revenue:From the 10-Q:Cost is, of course, a big driver propelling virtual care forward. From Motley Fool:Teladoc Health is the biggest player in the virtual care market. While its business model seems quite linear, there are some mechanisms for creating leverage:To an extent, this is a fixed-cost business, so if its platform is used more, then it creates some leverage. Strong growth in the health plan market actually produces an initial decline in utilization, but this effect wears off pretty soon.Economies of scope can also come in here, especially through broadening the types of services the company provides. From the Q1CC:And then there is the traditional operational leverage, which, as it happens, is already kicking in, especially on the S&M line, which is decreasing as a percentage of revenue.The company has a concentric circles approach to organizing its supply, the network of doctors that actually engage with patients. At the core, they are more aligned with Teladoc and (from the Q1CC):There are multiple avenues for growthLaunching new areas of virtual care is an obvious way to expand services and increase revenues. A big step occurred when the company acquired BetterHelp early in 2015 to enter the mental health market, as this has brought a big boost to revenues (although also a dosis of controversy, as there were concerns of patient care here).This year, management expects revenue growth from behavioral health to exceed 50%.And by partnering with Cincinnati Children's Hospital, the company is entering pediatric services that have a wide reach. From the Q1CC:In the US health plan market, companies are looking for ways to make virtual care the front of their plans, and it is here that there are other opportunities for Teladoc.The company has about 40 commercial health plans as customers (as part of its B2B market) with over 3 million paid members. It doesn't have the field to itself - competitors like Amwell (Anson) and MDLive (Cigna), Doctor on Demand (Humana) each have strategic health plan customers - but the field is still open.Teladoc can also expand existing relations, like that with the DoD's Tricare or United Therapeutics (UTHR). From the Q1CC:Although the pace of this is set by the organization in question, and that can lead to some frustrations (like with Tricare, which has moved considerably slower than management hoped).The recently released CMS rule seems to position virtual care well for inclusion in Medicare Advantage, with which the company is in active discussion, but this is more a topic for next year.International growth opportunities are also significant, and the company bought itself into the Spanish-speaking (but also Asian) market with the $352 million acquisition of Advance Medical, into the French market with the acquisition of Medicin Direct and with the launch of the Canadian Telemedicine program, which is seamless with the US program.Management argues that in many countries, adoption is swift, as virtual care offers a way for private providers to distinguish themselves from public programs.Despite a weaker flu season (flu visits down 32% in Q1 y/y), the company produced impressive results:From the earnings PR:Management is quite conservative about guidance. For instance, it hasn't included anything for expansions at Tricare or United. Management is confident about 20-30% organic growth for 2019 as well as 2020, with MA as a possible big catalyst.Data by YChartsGross margin took a dip in the quarter, but to a large extent that's the result of the Advance Medical acquisition. Q1 and Q4 are also usually the lowest-margin quarters, as the company experiences a higher concentration of visit activity.There is considerable operational leverage - a pleasant surprise - although in Q1, the GAAP operational margin moved back a bit on the acquisition cost.However, adjusted operating expenses are $82.6 million, or 64% of total revenue, compared to $64.2 million, or 72%, a year ago, producing considerable operational leverage. Most of this is in the S&M line.Data by YChartsCash flow is also improving steadily, which is nice to see, as it was flagged as a concern by short-sellers some time ago.Data by YChartsAt nearly $50 million, share-based compensation is substantial, but at 10% of revenue we have seen worse, and it's partly inflated by acquisitions. The dilution is, of course, the result of the share-based compensation, acquisitions and the lack of positive cash flow.The company still has plenty of cash on its books at $479.4 million (+$1 million for the quarter), which is almost as large as its debt ($562.5 million).Much has been made of a questionable referral program (via YouTube) for Teladoc's mental health business. While this is a little worrying as reputation and trust matter a great deal, it only represents about 5% of the company's new mental health members, a fraction of the growth of its mental health business, which so far seems unaffected by these concerns (management argues ""virtually none"").Then, there is the NCQA, the top healthcare accreditation organization, which placed placed Teladoc on “Corrective Action Status.” Although quite exactly what this means is a bit of a mystery, it's not good news - that much is clear. From The Fly:It doesn't sound too serious, at least the company got recertified - but that doesn't help. We've already discussed the cash burn and dilution above, and would be surprised if Teladoc didn't manage to appoint a new CFO in the near future.We're not oblivious to these risks (not in the least because there is a large short position that seems to bet on things going wrong), but so far they don't seem to be hampering the company's growth trajectory.Data by YChartsThere are 6.3 million shares from options, and fully diluted shares amount to 77 million, so the valuation is more like 10x sales. On the other hand, this is a backward-looking metric, and on a forward basis, this comes down to 8.5x sales.Analysts still expect substantial losses, with EPS at -$1.53 this year falling to -$1.14 in 2020. The shares have been a bit in the doldrums the past 12 months, effectively going nowhere:Teladoc is at the forefront of the burgeoning field of telemedicine, and has established a leading position with multiple growth avenues in front of it. While the business model seems quite linear at first sight, there are some mechanisms to generate leverage as well.The company still produces substantial losses, but the cash flow is nearly turning positive, and it still has a large amount of cash available. Valuation is fairly steep though. This isn't a SaaS company generating 80% gross margins, there is a fair amount of competition, and the company isn't free from some issues."
4281191,105265,2019-08-03T10:04:45-04:00,"Teladoc reported yet another quarter of solid results.The report included busy pipeline, increased utilization, and solid growth. We view the results as an indication of Teladoc's market potential and its leadership.We still continue to see value in the name and strongly recommend investors buy Teladoc.","We're writing here to follow up on our previous article on Teladoc (TDOC). In this article, we will assess the company's most recent quarterly report and its earnings call, as well as provide insight on where we think the company is heading. For convenience, we're including our Investment Thesis from our previous article.The results were, as is usually the case with Teladoc, solid. It performed well across the board and raised guidance and highlighted solid membership trends.Teladoc reported $130.3 million in revenues which represented an impressive 38% YoY growth and just beat consensus estimates of $129.6 million. This was at the high end of the management guidance range of $128 million to $131 million.All the underlying revenue related metrics seemed good. Organic revenues grew solidly at 24% YoY. Access fees grew at 39% YoY, reaching $111 million or 85% of total revenues. Total visits came in at 908k, well above the guided range of 775k-875k. U.S. paid member visits came in at 610k, representing a 40% YoY growth.Number of members were the only blemishes on the quarter, albeit minor ones. U.S. paid members came in at 26.8 million which was 19% than a year ago, just below the guidance range of 27 million-28 million. Visit fee only membership came in at 9.7 million, also just below the guidance 10 million.Teladoc reported gross margins of 68%, which was down from the 70.7% of a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA of $6.3 million was within the guided range of $5 million-$7 million. Net loss per share came in strong at $0.41 vs. guided range of $0.42-$0.44.Guidance for members, visits, revenues, and adjusted EBITDA were increased. Ranges for total paid members and total visits were raised to 29 million-30 million and 3.7 million-4 million from the prior ranges of 27 million-29 million and 3.6 million-3.9 million, respectively. Low end of the FY19 revenue guidance was increased with the range now standing at $538 million-$545 million from the previous range of $535 million-$545 million vs. consensus estimate of $541 million. Adjusted EBITDA guidance range was narrowed around the mid-point to $27 million-$33 million from the previous $25 million-$35 million vs. consensus of $29.4 million.The numbers of the quarter were very positive in general and pointed to the solid growth profile of the company.The quarter included positives much above the financials. Displayed in the strong visitor numbers, the demand for Teladoc's offerings continue to accelerate. The company reported multi-product bookings 4x and request for proposals (RFP) for the full integrated offering 75% higher than last year. This busy pipeline and accelerating bookings exemplifies another quarter in which the sector leader Teladoc capitalized on the increasing adoption of telehealth services.The management was particularly upbeat about behavioral health, and cited the segment as one of the strongest drivers of visit growth. The management said that behavioral health customer acquisition cost, member tenure duration, and lifetime value were all trending better and that behavioral health RFPs increased 200% in the first half of the year. Since $12 billion of the company estimated $57 billion total addressable market is in behavioral health, we view these trends as very positive on Teladoc's future.The company also gave updates on partnership programs. The management said that the United expansion and Medicare projects were progressing along according to schedule. The management was particularly upbeat about the Vida Health partnership and that they expected to see a benefit in FY20. We view these partnerships as extremely important for the future of Teladoc, as they are key enablers for the adoption of telehealth.The U.S. paid member miss was apparently due to timing of a client implementation. A large client moved its expansion from Q2 to Q3. We note the strong visits number despite the miss and a +100 bps improvement in utilization as key positive trends.Teladoc is firing on all cylinders and it shows in the quarter. The report highlighted all the things we wanted to see like an accelerating growth profile, a busy backlog, and increased utilization. We see the results as an indication of the market potential and the long runway of growth Teladoc has with its undisputed leadership in the attractive space.As before, we strongly recommend buying Teladoc."
4265448,22786,2019-05-21T03:42:49-04:00,Teladoc reported another strong quarter.The company is valued like a drug firm instead of as a fast-growing software services supplier.Upside price targets introduced.,"Teladoc (TDOC) enjoyed much of last year on an uptrend that led to the stock peaking at around $89. Yet, the end of the year 2018 selling took the stock back to the $40s. In the last two quarters, strong back-to-back earnings reports alleviated valuation concerns for TDOC stock. With the stock at $60, does Teladoc have more upside ahead?In March, Teladoc said that it would expand in Canada. The company will maximize capturing an even bigger addressable market with minimal costs by launching an app. This will give its customers 24x7 access to medical care anywhere in Canada. And with Toronto (Ontario) and Vancouver (British Columbia) being the biggest markets for Teladoc, the company should not expect smooth sailing. In Ontario, the provincial government is cutting back on health care spending. If Teladoc wants to advertise that it covers all areas, it will have to give service to rural customers too. Chasing too few potential rural customers could drive costs higher.In the near term, Teladoc’s challenge will be getting its name and service known. If it fails to gain recognition, this expansion will have more costs exceeding the revenue it brings in.The company reported an impressive 59% Y/Y revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Even though it lost $0.33 a share, strong user growth could justify the valuation. The stock trades at 9.6 times sales and four times book with the debt/equity of 0.42 times. If investors compare the company to other software services stocks, then TDOC is a bargain. MongoDB (MDB) trades at 30 times book, while Okta (OKTA), which I previously pitched to DIY Value Investors, trades at 49 times book.Teladoc shares are stuck in a trading range and trail MongoDB and Okta in the last year:Data by YChartsTeladoc’s total visits grew 86% to 861,000. EBITDA grew 146%, albeit to just $5.8 million. For the year 2018, revenue grew 79% to $418 million as the company lost $1.47 a share. This is still an improvement over 2017, in which the company lost $1.93.Teladoc ended the fiscal year with $478.5 million in cash and $562.5 million in debt.2019 revenue will be $535-545 million, while EBITDA loss will be $40-50 million. The current Q1 is seasonally the weakest, so if the stock falls in this period, those who want to buy into the client growth may consider investing in it.In the second quarter, management expects total revenue in the range of $128-131 million. Its EBITDA loss will be between $13 million and $15 million.Teladoc has partnerships with UnitedHealth (UNH) and CVS Health (CVS), both of which I think are undervalued at this time. Headwinds in this sector could hold all of these stocks back.Teladoc’s path to profitability is measured by visits per user. If clinical services and products per user increases, the company could get closer to breakeven. Watch the utilization curve too. On the cost side, as call center requests fall from 60% to 26% in Q4, losses will decline.Investors may look at Teladoc in two ways. If viewed at strictly as a health services supplier, then comparing its valuations to other software firms may prove expensive. Still, the company benefits from behavioral health driving growth within its clinical specialty unit. Momentum for DTC and B2B channels is driving strong adoption. This gives management the confidence that revenue will grow at above 50% for the full year.Wall Street is extremely bullish on TDOC stock. 13 analysts covering the stock have an $81 target, or an upside of 40%. If investors assume revenue consistent growth of at least 20% or higher in the next five years, a 5-year DCF Revenue Exit Model (per finbox.io) suggests TDOC has a fair value of ~$75.The drug store and drug plan market is out of favor and creating deep value opportunities in the sector. This bearishness may have pulled TDOC stock lower by limiting its rally following strong quarterly user growth. Technology investors will appreciate Teladoc’s moat in building a network with health plan providers. Its leading-edge online solution could help bridge the technology needs of the major players like CVS Health, Cigna, and UnitedHealth."
4279421,89655,2019-07-31T07:53:10-04:00,Gross Margin Risk - Growing share of lower-margin Visit Only Fee appointments vs Per Member Per Month (PMPM) paid visits eroding gross margins.Trading Multiple Risk - Shifting business model will skew revenue and earnings visibility and warrant lower a trading multiple.Market Share Risk - Heightened inevitable competitive climate will drive Visit Fees to steady-state and drive CapEx higher to retain a leading market position.,"For the three reasons mentioned in the summary, I would issue an Overweight rating and valuation range of $45-69. This is despite Teladoc's (NYSE:TDOC) current market position and platform's capacity to serve the large, diverse addressable global market. I apply and evenly weight a range of valuation approaches to arrive at a $52.54 price target as noted in Figure 8.Founded in 2002 and based in Purchase, NY, Teladoc Health is the global leader of comprehensive virtual healthcare services. Their portfolio of services and solutions covers 450 medical subspecialties ranging from non-urgent flu cases to chronic, complicated medical cases like cancer.2018 was another year of strong growth for Teladoc Health with revenue and visits of $418m (+79% YoY, +36% organic) and 2.64m visits (+80% YoY), respectively, exceeding management guidance while adjusted EBITDA turned positive ($13.4m) and 19.6m more US Paid Members (+16% YoY adjusted for Aetna lives) were registered. TDOC’s FY18 EPS (-$1.47) continued a 5yr upward trend also beating management guidance of -$1.48 (high-end). TDOC also addressed working capital concerns and strongly positioned themselves for further strategic acquisitions with a $287.5m “2025 Note” issuance in May and a $330.9m July equity raise. Initial guidance for FY19 revenue was $535-545, adjusted EBITDA of $25-35, with 27-29m US paid members and between 3.6-3.9m total visits.This top-line guidance I believe underestimates paid membership and total visits numbers given the growing adoption of virtual health care solutions, both domestically and internationally, the greater total addressable market through the 1Q19 MédecinDirect and 2018 Advance Medical acquisitions; combined with TDOC’s unique position as the only comprehensive provider. I see further declines in gross margins as the business model mix continues to shift from PMPM to the lower margin Visit Fee-Only (VFO) business; while fixed PMPM fees are spread among more visits with growing utilization lowering total revenue per visit. As a result, my FY19 adjusted EBITDA $26.2m estimate lies on the lower end of management guidance.In 1Q19, TDOC registered an 11th consecutive quarterly top-line beat ($128.6m, +0.46% surprise) while EPS also narrowly beat street estimates (-$0.43 vs -$0.44). Total visits for the quarter crossed the 1 million mark (1.06m, +75% YoY or +29% organically), despite lower flu visits (-32% YoY), and an additional 3.9m (+17% QoQ) US paid members were added within the quarter with an 11% annualized utilization (9.4% in FY18). Of the total visits, 68% were from US Paid Members (91% in 1Q18) while PMPM declined QoQ to $1.03 from $1.16 due to the impact of the new health plan members – aligning to my above FY19 assumptions. TDOC’s balance sheet remains strong with a $31.7m net cash position (net cash since 2018 equity and debt issuances) which positions them well for an industry ripe for further competition.With no pure virtual care public comp, the peer group of best fit was the Health Care Technology (HCT) industry due to the similarity in service offerings. Even at the 3rd quartile of forward P/Sales and EV/Sales comps, TDOC’s implies downsides of 18% and 29%, respectively. TDOC also trades slightly above the third quartile of its historic P/Sales range. Recent insider trading is also indicative of lofty current valuations with a net amount of 69,854 shares sold year to date at an average sale price of $63.01. My price target of $52.54 implies a 39% premium to median HCT EV/Sales multiple, justified by the leading virtual care market position and rampant YoY revenue growth, but at a 21% discount to the EMCLOUD 9.9x forward multiple due to the business mix shifting trend away from a PMPM model as noted earlier. My base FY19 estimates imply sales of $575m, 30.9m paid members, 10% utilization, and 4.1m visits. A WACC of 11.24% is applied to FCFFs relatively higher than peers due to the unknown risks of infant virtual care market, in addition to the high 7.9% and 10% effective interest rates on TDOC’s Notes.Telemedicine and virtual healthcare addresses the key issues of cost and access to healthcare delivery and presents a $130.5bn market opportunity (19% CAGR 2018-26). Considering the high domestic internet penetration, the industry remains untapped with both regulators (i.e. NCQA, HIPAA) and consumers are warming to the non-traditional approach. A 2018 Accenture Consumer Health Survey showed that 29% (up YoY from 21% in 2017) of US respondents have used some form of virtual care. For these reasons, I believe that there are significant growth opportunities for Teladoc Health to capitalize on given current market position, scalable tech platform expanding global footprint.Despite these tailwinds, I believe TDOC’s shifting trend away from a PMPM model justifies the Overweight rating for the following reasons:Inadequate diagnosis (or outright misdiagnosis) through virtual care can lead to persistence in patient symptoms, unnecessary prescriptions, and follow up trips to ER or urgent care. However, as technology continues to advance and the value proposition becomes more apparent through data, these risks will decline, bending the cost curve. TTM Legal and regulatory expenses amount to 28% of TTM adjusted EBITDA (down from 30% in FY18) and the continued NCQA accreditation, although cautionary, shows warming to the virtual care space.TDOC’s utilization has incrementally risen from 6.1% in FY14 to 9.4% in FY18. Although the most common virtually treated health issues are the more minor colds, flu, sore throats and rashes, the clinical scope of TDOC’s offerings positions them well to alternatively serve the more expensive, acute and chronic common physical visits. Once the patient/client transitions this, the utilization will in number and value. The API-driven tech platform has the capacity for 100m members and 50k visits per day (vs the current 7k average).My current bearish stance on TDOC would be strengthened should 2Q19 earnings on Wednesday trigger the following catalysts:Revenue surprise: 1Q19 revenue eked out a 0.5% surprise from street estimates - a trend that has aligned with the shift from PMPM model. When TDOC last failed to meet Street estimates in 2Q16 shares opened 21% lower the following day and given the current valuation levels, I see a similar share move down should 2Q19 come in lower than expected.Continued Margin erosion: On the margin side, Q1 gross margins tend to be lower than the rest of the year but should 2Q19 come in relatively flat from the historic low 65.3% 1Q19 figure, further downward pressure on TDOC’s trading multiples are warranted.Positive Adjusted EBITDA trend bucked: Moreover, should adjusted EBITDA break its positive trend and the total operating expenses reaccelerate greater than revenue growth, concerns of the synergies from TDOC’s past acquisitive strategy will be raised.I would remain cautiously short TDOC till the full year 2019 (or upon a significant company announcement), should these events not materialise.See full equity report here."
4259636,104985,2019-05-03T12:43:38-04:00,"Q1 2019 results narrowly beat expectations. EPS is still negative, but CEO remains bullish, and results are well received. TDOC stock is up marginally.Much has been made of the impact telemedicine will have on modern healthcare, but investors can expect to wait a while longer for large gains.The bulk of Teladoc’s growth has been driven by acquisition -- the right way for the company to position itself for success.Although Teladoc may be overvalued, its shares remain a solid opportunity to back a company with a first mover advantage in a potentially high-growth sector.The key to the success (or otherwise) for Teladoc is its ability to secure lucrative deals with health plan providers and insurers, which would provide a huge membership base and consistent revenues, especially now that the government has approved virtual health for Medicare Advantage plans.","Right now, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) represents amateur investors’ only chance to buy a chunk of the emerging telemedicine market. Teladoc, a provider of on-demand healthcare via mobile devices, the internet, video and phone, is competing in this emerging market, which is already becoming a crowded space, occupied by the likes of well-funded startups MD Live and American Well. Only Teladoc, however is a listed entity, having IPO’d all the way back in June 2015.Despite the obvious advantages of telehealth; convenience, elimination of travel time, and cost savings being three major ones, the industry has not quite taken off in the way some analysts predicted. If you search for them, you can find all kinds of predictions suggesting that the telemedicine market will grow at a CAGR of 15-25% between now and 2023, which is encouraging, but also subjective and speculative.Nobody quite knows if populations will embrace telehealth - perhaps we will all eventually conclude that we prefer seeing doctors in person, or that diagnoses made virtually are not precise enough.On the other hand, telemedicine companies have just been handed a huge boost by Congress, which has approved a budget for virtual health consultations for any American who is enrolled into the increasingly popular Medicare Advantage health insurance plan.The bulk of Teladoc’s $128.6m Q119 revenues, around 82%, are driven by its 26.7m members - a figure which the company reported in its most recent set of results Q119, has risen 28% year on year. Teladoc operates a per member, per month (PMPM) pricing model, and revenue from these subscription access fees topped $100m for the quarter. $106m, to be precise, an increase of 48% compared to one year previous. One-off visit fee revenue reached $22.6m - a 26% year on year increase. International subscription fee revenue accounted for around 25m of total subscription revenue.It’s clear then, that the arrangements Teladoc makes with its 12,000+ clients, of whom more than 40% are Fortune 500 companies, to provide subscription fee access are key to its prospects of success. Most important of all are likely to be Teladoc’s health plan clients, of which it currently has over 35, according to a January 2019 investor presentation.PMPM subscriptions have grown at a CAGR of 24%, driven by an aggressive sales and marketing strategy which is currently a significant strain on resources. A gross margin of 65% (Q119 figure) seems impressive, but only includes cost of revenue. Then you have to subtract, from the $84m of gross profit, the costs of sales ($16.2m), advertising ($26.4m), technology and development ($16m), and general and administrative ($36m), amongst others. Add all these costs up and you have a net loss of $22.9m, resulting in net loss per share of -$0.43 - worse than the previous year’s -$0.39.Teladoc doesn’t break down its membership figures, or say where the bulk of its visits come from. Although in Q119 the company says it received more than 1 million visits across paid visits and members - an impressive number - CEO Jason Gorevic, during the earnings call made the following comment:A while back, in these pages an article was published suggesting that Teladoc’s impressive visit and membership numbers were being somewhat artificially driven by a 2015 acquisition, BetterHelp. BetterHelp is a mental health counselling app that may have used controversial marketing techniques, including paying YouTubers to promote its service, to aggressively drive sign ups to its service - resulting in high levels of Churn.The article suggested that “BetterHelp could be contributing as much as 70% of organic subscription revenue growth to Teladoc.”If true, that could be a worry for investors, as, coupled with the exorbitantly high price Teladoc seems to have to pay to acquire new customers, BetterHelp is a niche service, that does not necessarily address the core telemedicine market. It’s great that Teladoc is winning in the mental health space, but will success in mental health allow the company to successfully pitch use cases to Medicare Advantage health plan provider clients - and reach America's elderly population (where the really big money will be made, in my view)?I would argue it is hard to know whether Teladoc’s numbers are sufficiently diversified across all forms of the health spectrum, but I do agree with the company’s position that the more people are given the possibility to try a virtual doctor, be it for mental or physical health, the more they will use the service. In other words, if Teladoc can survive in the short term and go on to win big health plan contracts, the growth could be exponential, and the share price will grow and grow, making the price at the time of writing ($58) well worth paying based on future earning potential.In order to buy Teladoc stock, clearly, you have to be a believer in the potential of telemedicine. If you are, then you are also likely to be in agreement with Teladoc’s growth by acquisition strategy. As with the company’s sales and marketing strategy, the growth by acquisition strategy is expensive.According to their most recent 10K, Teladoc acquired Advance Medical in May 2018, in a stock and shares deal worth $352m. Advance medical contributed $45m of revenues to Teladoc from May to December 2018. Best Doctors was acquired in July 2017 for $446m, in a mostly cash funded deal, and one year previous, Teladoc acquired HealthiestYou - this time the acquisition was share driven, and cost $145.3m.If Teladoc were a stand alone company trying to grow organically by pitching a visit-fee only service, you would fear for its future. But by making strategic acquisitions, the most recent being MédecinDirect, a Paris, France based telehealth startup, the company is acquiring expertise, market share, and an international presence, from Europe, to South America, to Canada.Plus, the company’s cash position is solid. In the Q119 earnings call Gabriel Capucci, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, summarised the balance sheet, thus:Should Teladoc wish to make further acquisitions, they have the money to do so, it would seem. The company, being the only currently listed telemedicine play, has a strong competitive advantage here.As I mentioned earlier in this article, the decision by congress to allow the CMS to fund telehealth services via Medicare Advantage health plans could be huge for Teladoc and its fellow telehelath providers such as MD Live and American Well. According to Forbes Senior Contributor Bruce Jensen:This represents a major opportunity not only for Teladoc to partner with the firms providing Medicare Advantage plans, who will submit their bids to the CMS in June (although it may be 2020, or even 2021 before they decide to include telehealth provisions) but also to deliver telehealth services en masse to the elderly generation for the first time.As also mentioned earlier, Teladoc’s management believe that once they have a taste for it, America’s rapidly growing elderly population will embrace virtual health, leading to substantial growth in visits. Teladoc’s cost of revenue is low, and the company can win big should such an eventuality take hold.What’s more, health plan providers are big fans of telehealth because it has the potential to increase their own profit margins, which are currently tight, and likely to be squeezed further as they are forced to pass more of the rebates they secure with drug manufacturers on to customers. Keeping customers out of hospital and reducing the requirement for physical doctor visits is a key goal for these companies, as well as the government and the hospitals themselves, and Teladoc can help them to achieve that goal by making appointments virtual instead.Teladoc has recently entered into a partnership with United Health, to roll out its service to United’s vast membership base. Although this has been a slow burner to date, this is precisely the kind of mature deal that should please investors. In my view, if they can make it work, this should turn out ot be a mutually profitable relationship. Another promising tie-up is with CVS Health, who are leveraging Teladoc’s technology as part of their Virtual Healthcare Minute Clinics.The response to Teladoc’s Q119 results and projections for the year ahead, which remain largely unchanged from the ones made at FY18, appears to have been positive. The share price gained nearly 2% yesterday, to reach $58.Year on year revenue growth of 43%, and a 75% increase in visit numbers are encouraging, even if they should be tempered by Teladoc’s unwillingness to break down the numbers and show precisely where the visits and membership numbers are coming from.But, as I have argued, it’s the way the company are positioning themselves to take advantage of the opportunities that are beginning to present themselves, and will continue to present themselves if, as is likely, telemedicine becomes “the next big thing” in healthcare, that should really excite investors.Many will believe that growth in telehealth services is an inevitability, and Teladoc’s share price will look very attractive to them.A recent Forbes article suggested that Teladoc’s reliance on adjusted EBITDA as a measure of success was misleading, and that the fact that executive pay was tied to revenue growth, meant that management were too focused on artificially driving revenue growth.The article also suggested that, to justify its current share price, Teladoc will need to “grow revenue by 30% compounded annually for the next 13 years.”Depending on whether you are a believer in the transformative power of telehealth or not, you may see that challenge as eminently achievable, or otherwise.Personally, whilst I feel there may be some teething issues around growing membership numbers and visits organically, I believe the potential trumps the problems and that at current price, whilst it may be a touch overvalued, Teladoc is a stock well worth owning at the riskier end of a balanced technology portfolio, for the reasons outlined above."
4274885,102107,2019-07-15T07:30:00-04:00,"Value investing has continued to morph as the long bull market marches on.Our panel's views on the market and the way they are approaching all-time highs suggest value remains in the eye of the beholder.This is leading to finding value in some obvious places - large-cap tech, for example - but also further flung spots like foreign markets and, yes, financials.","By Daniel ShvartsmanThe first half of 2019 saw a lot of green in the markets, as broader indices recovered from the brief bear market in the second half of 2018 and returned to new heights. Despite that, the wall of worry continued to grow, even if the specific concerns changed. Instead of a rising rate environment, expectations have shifted to a possible rate cut even with good job numbers. Geopolitical flash points have (re-)emerged in Venezuela, Iran, and in the ongoing China-US trade conflict. European economic growth appears to be slowing, and nobody's quite sure where we are in the US cycle. Oh, and another presidential election cycle is beginning.So, what to make of this all? We decided to take the temperature of the markets with a midyear Marketplace Roundtable. We asked our Seeking Alpha Marketplace contributors - authors who run investing services and provide ideas and guidance to members about how to think about the markets or at least certain parts of it - to share their views on the current climate and how they're positioning as a result.Over 55 authors participated in our survey. We've grouped their responses into several categories, ranging from tech to commodities, biotech to dividends and income investing. We're going to share their responses in those grouped categories over the coming week or so. Each discussion will have two common questions about the market as a whole, two sector-specific questions, and a round of current favorite ideas. We hope you enjoy the discussion, and welcome you to join with comments on these issues or on any key points that didn't come up, or follow-up questions.Today's edition covers value investing, which remains as heterodox and diverse as ever in 2019. Here's our panel:Please check the end of article for disclosures - authors disclosed positions based on stocks they respectively discussed.Andres Cardenal: I would say that there are still plenty of uncertainty drivers in the market - economic growth is slowing down all over the world, tensions with China in areas such as IP will be a long-lasting discussion, and monetary policy is in a transition phase. This is actually a good thing, since negative sentiment keeps money on the sidelines and provides the fuel for rising prices. The time to sell is generally when most investors are optimistic and the consensus is bullish.Chris Lau: The market could conceivably rise another 25%. Even after the U.S. slapped punitive tariffs against China, raising prices for Americans, the Fed will still cut rates. On Jan. 1, 2019, markets thought rates would keep going up. Either way, keep your eyes on beaten down stocks on sale instead of guessing on the market's direction.Dining Stocks Online: Market sentiment has definitely rebounded completely from the fourth quarter of 2018. Most of the potential positives are now priced in, which limits further upside. Investors should be wary, as the risk/reward balance is no longer tilted in the direction of long-positioned investors.Fred Piard: At the end of June, the AAII sentiment was neutral with a bearish inclination. The short interest in stocks has been increasing in the second half of June. It seems the ""crowd"" and the ""smart money"" are still both in doubt.Michael Boyd: The flip-flop on the Federal Reserve has been the primary driver of stronger equity markets. There is no doubt in my mind that, if Jerome Powell had not capitulated on the rate hike schedule, we'd be materially lower than where we are now. The question that should be asked is ""Why has the Fed changed course?"" If you believe the private bank is truly data dependent, then the answer is a simple one: data has soured. We see that in ISM Manufacturing rolling over, we see that in unemployment figures. History repeats itself, and investors likely remember years ago when ""bad news is good news"" when it comes to Fed policy. At what point does bad news become actual bad news?Ruerd Heeg: I am surprised this fairy tale has not come to an end yet. Valuations in the US are now extremely high. I do not think that is sustainable. So, my market doubts have not been resolved yet. Moreover, compared to 5 years ago, there are fewer and fewer analysts telling us the market will go much higher. I expect some kind of unpredictable event causing US stocks to go down again.Fear & Greed Trader: Yes - in my view, the doubts were overstated.Trapping Value: The market is still climbing a wall of worry. We went in heavily short in May, but towards the end of May, something changed. We were seeing persistent negative sentiment and just no breakdown in the indices. We were seeing huge outflows from equities, and again, the indices held up far better than we thought. So, we made a tactical decision in our portfolios on May 23, to cover all short positions and go 100% long. We think there is more upside here as investors abandon 2% yielding Treasuries and return to equities.David Trainer: On the surface, the economy appears strong. However, when we dig below the surface, we find that corporate profits are not as healthy as reported. This finding increases market risk and does not appear to be factored into current prices. Specifically, when we analyzed fully-adjusted economic earnings, we found that after tax cuts were removed, economic earnings actually declined by 2% YoY. Only two sectors (Technology and Energy) managed to show any significant improvement in economic earnings (without tax cuts), even as eight of 11 sectors reported rising GAAP profits. This disconnect means that except for a few highly profitable firms, most stocks are at serious risk of major declines should the market’s mood turn sour.JD Henning: ""Doubt is the origin of wisdom"" ~ Augustine of Hippo. In the last 60 years, the S&P 500 has only ever exceeded 30% three times: 1975, 31.6%; 1995, 34%; and 1997, 31%. Currently, the S&P 500 is on a trajectory we have not seen since 1958 when the index gained over 38%. I submit that this incredible performance emerges in part from the highest levels of stock buybacks ever recorded, at a pace more than $18 billion ahead of 2018 when buybacks beat the previous record by an astounding $217.3 billion. As stock prices surge, more investment capital follows. ETF inflows in June surged to $63.8 billion, only slightly behind the all-time record January 2018 inflows. The divergence between earnings and high rates of return are growing. Be wise.WG Investment Research: Most investors that I have recently spoken to still doubt this market. They struggle to find attractive investments in today’s environment and they are concerned about the near-term prospects of the market, especially after factoring in the ongoing trade war and where they see us being in the economic cycle. Equities have been pretty resilient through the ups and downs that have been largely created by Washington (i.e., not just our president) but, in my opinion, there are real concerns that need to be considered even in what seems to be a promising backdrop. For example, I do not believe that the real possibility of an unresolved trade war with China is priced into the market.Value Digger: A strong non-farm payrolls report was one of the factors that gave a boost to the market lately because it showed that the economy remains resilient with companies confident enough to continue hiring. Additionally, the Fed will most likely cut rates this year, and I expect the U.S.-China trade war to come to an end in the second half of this year, which adds two more parameters to the bullish mix. Nevertheless, I believe that the market doubt is not resolved, so I continue to suggest a cautious approach due to some recent relatively weak macro developments such as PMI data, the inverted yield curve etc.Joseph L. Shaefer: I certainly hope not. Markets that climb a wall of worry create the best gains. The most dangerous time for stock markets is when there is no doubt; that means that most everyone has thrown caution to the winds and is now long the market. One reason for prudence remains. Yes, the market is up 25% from the lows for the first thus far in 2019; that is great. However, at the end of the first three quarters in 2018, it was up 8.0%, yet finished the year down 7.5% (plunging 14.3% in the 12 weeks ending December 31, 2018.) A longer memory than 6 months is essential for successful investment management. Fortune favors the prudent and watchful!Lejun James Shao: Buying on fear. The worst is over now. Based on data from FactSet that US corporate earnings growth will re-accelerate in the second half this year, I believe that S&P 500 will close 2019 at around 3,120-3,200 level.Andres Cardenal: Growth stocks and high quality stocks have done really well, while small caps and value stocks are underperforming. It will be interesting to watch relative performance, since market rotation can provide plenty of opportunities once a particular sector starts outperforming.Chris Lau: We thought the drug store, drug manufacturing, and biotechnology sector would recover by now. But the government's consideration for healthcare for all and demands for lower drug prices are hurting the sector. Look at UnitedHealth (UNH), Walgreens (WBA), and CVS Health (CVS).Dining Stocks Online: The pace of M&A activity in the restaurant sector continues, even accelerating as activists target poorly performing, cash flow generating chains. While sentiment is not overwhelmingly positive within the sector right now, we see activist activity as a potential catalyst when dealing with cheap stocks in the restaurant space.Fred Piard: A part of my portfolio is based on value-oriented quantitative models. My research in 2019 has not been about changing models but about risk management and testing new macro indicators. My subscribers have already access to them, and you can expect some research results in free-access articles.Michael Boyd: I think the rollover in China, whether you blame that on naturally tougher comps or trade concerns, has brought renewed skepticism on overseas-sourced revenue. Asian economies, in general, have not done well of late. I've avoided Asia for some time but am actually starting to get more interesting there today on a relative basis. Beijing has plenty of stimulus options on the table.Ruerd Heeg: Recently, several value investors mentioned differences in valuations between expensive growth stocks and value stocks have increased. I think that is true within the US but also between different geographic markets. This happened also just before the dotcom crash. If history repeats, now could be a good time to start value investing. Anyway, what I keep doing is researching the cheapest stocks, with several strategies based on quantitative rankings.Fear & Greed Trader: I remain focused on what is working - Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and now, look to Healthcare for opportunity.David Trainer: We’re always looking to exploit our analytical advantage to identify value and value traps. Traditional metrics such as P/E ratios, return on equity, debt-to-equity, and price-to-book are flawed. We focus on more comprehensively analyzing profits and valuation based on our proprietary footnotes analysis. Our measures of return on invested capital and price to economic book value give us an edge when it comes to finding good long and short ideas.JD Henning: The Fed has my attention while it is still aggressively engaged in quantitative tightening (QT) even as the markets are focused on an interest rate cut at the July 30 meeting. As the events last October showed, the market reacted very badly when the Fed first reached its monthly cap of $50 billion in asset unwinding and strained market liquidity through December. Now, $3.81 trillion remain on the Fed's balance sheet and the latest rolloff of treasuries and MBS of $34 billion in June demonstrate they are keeping their aggressive rolloff schedule through 2019. Just as the quantitative easing (QE) programs from 2008 to 2015 added trillions in financial liquidity to bolster markets, the current reduction of $687 billion from peak QE is likely to have either an inverse linear or a threshold breaking impact on the markets the further the balance sheet is reduced. Related to this, volatility in 2018 spiked under QT with 20 different days where the S&P 500 moved +/- more than 2% at a frequency double any prior year from 2012 under the low volatility QE program. Through 2019, we have only had 4 days of +/- 2% moves on the S&P 500 and, for now, remain well below the level last year since the QT program began in earnest. While the expected July rate cut may help fuel the record stock buyback binge with lower interest rates, the amount of liquidity the Fed continues to drain from their balance sheet may catch up to markets at a critical time. Watching how these forces affect the markets will be an important factor behind the market sustaining new highs.WG Investment Research: Investor sentiment. I have been positioning my portfolio(s) for a muted market for at least the last year, but it turns out that I have been early with my call (yes, wrong). It is, however, hard to deny the fact that the current bull market appears to long in the tooth, and, in my opinion, a broader market pullback is not only due but it is also necessary. The U.S. economy is solid, if you look past the noise being created by Washington, but I believe that a 5-10% correction would be healthy and would actually create some very attractive long-term buying opportunities. So, I am paying close attention to sentiment (for both the broader market and for the specific companies) when researching new positions. Moreover, I plan to stay defensive through 2019/2020.Value Digger: My research team and I focus on five sectors (i.e. industrial, consumer goods, healthcare, mining, energy) and therefore, it's not easy to briefly mention what has changed in these sectors in H1 2019 primarily because of two reasons. First, each sector is subject to its own characteristics, considerations and risks. Second, each sector is divided into sub-sectors with different parameters. For instance, the mining sector consists of a bunch of sub-sectors (i.e. gold/silver, base metals, lithium, cobalt etc.). However, all the aforementioned five sectors share one thing in common. They still host companies with a gross mismatch between what their stock trades for and what it's actually worth, which usually translates into excellent long and short ideas. When it comes to our long picks, we always want to buy a stock with a big margin of safety. The margin of safety is the difference between the intrinsic value of the stock and the price you pay for it. When it comes to our short ideas, we focus on highly leveraged names, bubbles and fad stocks.Joseph L. Shaefer: I have no single sector – nor even a single asset class. Academia has now proven what smart investors have known all along: “to every thing, there is a season.” Sometimes, real assets versus paper, sometimes bonds over stocks, sometimes one sector or industry over another. What has my attention is not researching positions but rather researching the broad market and its many sectors. Right now, I am moving more into income rather than “concept,” resistance to decline over the next hot thing, and companies that provide a compelling value no matter the zigs and zags of the market.Andres Cardenal: US stocks are relatively expensive in general, but there are plenty of attractive opportunities in technology, software, semiconductors, and genomics. In addition to this, international stocks are comparatively undervalued. In simple terms, I'm betting on technology, software, semis, genomics, and international stocks.Chris Lau: My DIY Value Investing model held 1/4 cash. We will enter positions in discounted sectors because rate cuts and ongoing hopes of some trade deal will drive stock valuations higher. This includes the healthcare sector, basic materials, and technology stocks left out of the rallyDining Stocks Online: We are positioned as we always are; focused on relatively cheap stocks with solid fundamentals and rather healthy balance sheet. That mix should work well over the long haul, regardless of near-term market dynamics.Fred Piard: I will take the market as it comes week by week and make decisions based on data. I plan to continue with my quantitative models in the dynamic part of my portfolio. In my long-term holdings (mostly real estate ETFs, dividend ETFs and precious metal funds), I may occasionally trade partial positions to improve my average cost. Most important: I keep some cash.Michael Boyd: After having been quite long off of January, I'm leaning more cash and on the short side than I have been in the past. The sectors that do well relatively if we are in fact late cycle (consumer staples, utilities), while they have underperformed in 2019, are still pretty crowded, in my opinion, and healthcare remains a tough sell, given the Democratic party planks heading into the election. I'd much rather be short select companies in select end markets rather than buy into overbought conditions.Ruerd Heeg: I invest in extremely cheap stocks based on a good mix of fundamental metrics and in somewhat less cheap and more trustworthy companies with better earnings quality and asset allocation. I keep doing this, because I do not think it pays off trying to time the market. There is one exception, however, which is my Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) short. This company is suffering from low margins, high losses, and a lack of cash. Therefore, I think we will see a much lower Tesla stock price within a year and probably already within a couple of months. By the way, that could cause many other stocks to go down as well.Fear & Greed Trader: Until the long-term bullish trend decidedly changes, I remain positioned with a bullish bias.Trapping Value: Everyone is on recession watch, and that is something we are not taking our eyes off. But the incoming data, including the cycle peak for new home sales, tells us that the recession is not coming till middle of 2020 at the earliest. We are biasing towards small caps which have lagged the rally and expect them to catch up.David Trainer: We see the potential for what we call the “Micro-Bubbles” to burst in the near future. The walls are closing in for high-flying stocks like Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla. These high-flying stocks have traded at valuations that are entirely untethered to their fundamentals. As management touts “disruption” and “innovation”, Netflix and Tesla burn billions of dollars a year with no end in sight. These firms’ lofty valuations are at greater risk of falling as more investors see through the rhetoric and heed fundamentals. We’re betting against these micro-bubble stocks and betting on the incumbents, like GM (GM) and Disney (DIS), who have solid cash flows and cheap valuations.JD Henning: Since the start in 2017, my momentum model has beaten the S&P 500 with over 32% average annual returns. Signals from the momentum gauges that I track daily also helped avoid the May decline and the prior October correction. I plan to continue to monitor market conditions for the best gains possible for as long as these record capital inflows and momentum conditions keep building. My multiple discriminant analysis approach identifies the strongest variables contributing to stock gains and guides the selections toward the most attractive sectors and industries on a weekly basis. Currently, fundamental variables are not as strong as other characteristics like money flow and net institutional buying. Reviewing the similarities with 2018 does have me cautious that the back half of the year could also reflect recurring seasonality patterns and an increased risk that the Fed is unable to sustain these such low levels of volatility while still aggressively unwinding the balance sheet. Coupled with the highest rate of return from the S&P 500 in 60 years, the likelihood of some profit taking and defensive posture is increasing for my positions in the back half of 2019. Until the signals change again, I remain fully invested since the momentum gauges moved back into positive levels in June.Value Digger: First, we will continue to play both sides of the market, long and short. Second, diversification is a key success factor, so we will continue to diversify our portfolio by picking long and short ideas from a variety of sectors. Currently, we focus on the industrial, consumer goods, healthcare, mining, and energy sectors. When it comes to our short ideas, we will continue to short highly leveraged and overhyped stocks from overhyped sectors (i.e. marijuana stocks). When it comes to our long ideas, one thing we did on Value Investor's Stock Club is to shine our flashlight in the dark corners of the market unearthing overlooked small caps with healthy balance sheets and strong catalysts. So, we will continue to do this in H2 2019 and 2020 because we believe that alpha is abundant in small caps, and investors can have the highest equal-weighted returns in the small caps space. This is how we discovered Flexible Solutions International Inc. (FSI) for our subscribers last January. FSI has risen about 250% since our bullish call and has been included in the Top 5 with the best-performing stocks in 2019.Joseph L. Shaefer: “Why” flows from the two questions above and “what” means positioning into corporate (not K1) energy infrastructure giants, favoring particularly those that also have renewables components; equity income funds, ETFs and closed-ends that provide both income and growth; neglected-in-this-rally real asset firms (like real estate and metals) that offer both yield and compelling value; and of course, the ever-present special situations that reward only those willing to do the deep research to discover.Andres Cardenal: In order to find value stocks nowadays, you need to be able to look beyond the traditional valuation ratios that put too much emphasis on current earnings. The company's true value will depend on the cash flows that it generates in the future, and growth is a key component of intrinsic value. Many high-quality growth stocks may appear expensive when looking at simplistic valuation ratios, but when you take a deeper look at the company and its potential, you find that there are plenty of opportunities hidden in plain sight among high-quality growth stocks.Chris Lau: Value investors are suffering the most as markets reward Netflix, Amazon.com (AMZN), and other high fliers. Exercise patience and buy stocks having a catalyst ahead. Eventually, the discount will shrink as the stock recovers. Value - Do you see any patterns as far as where attractive value stocks are popping up in the market as we hover around all-time highs?David Krejca: Although I am focusing on profitable and high-growing companies most of the time, recently, I was surprised by several less-known data analytics and software companies that have turned around their income statement from small losses into black figures. One of such companies is Alteryx (AYX), a data-analytics company providing solutions which simplify programming work.Dining Stocks Online: Consumer discretionary stocks seem to be a mixed bag. Within dining, high growth franchise business models are hot, whereas slower growth owned chains are out of favor. If your chain is located near shopping malls, that is a further complication. We believe there is a lot of value for companies that mint money and are exposed to these underpriced micro issues. In addition to PLAY, we also like chains like Cheesecake Factory (CAKE), which is suffering from mall exposure but is a brand that is likely to survive and thrive versus smaller, weaker competitors.Fred Piard: Based on my monthly dashboard of June, energy, communication services and biotechnology were slightly underpriced relative to their historical averages. I may have already published an update when you read this. It is a group picture. There may be underpriced and overpriced stocks in any industry.Michael Boyd: Value continues to underperform growth just as it has for several years now. The best performing sectors in the S&P 500 this year are Technology and Consumer Discretionary, the worst are Utilities and Healthcare. That's a pretty clear indicator of where we sit; the market is still ""risk on"" unless we are talking about a few select areas like automotive or housing. If you have been in 100% value stocks, odds are you have not kept up with the S&P 500.Ruerd Heeg: In the US, we hover around all-time highs, both in absolute terms and based on valuation. But many foreign stock markets are much cheaper. Apparently, nobody wants these stocks, so I invest in them. At the moment, I do not see patterns in these stocks, unlike a couple of years ago, for example, with Japanese construction companies and oil stocks. But patterns or not, with quantitative rankings I still find great stocks. So, unlike many other investors, I do not use patterns to find high returning stocks.Fear & Greed Trader: Contrary to the consensus view, I see plenty of value, the stocks I mention as favorites below are just a few.Trapping Value: Energy space is highly hated, and the Canadian energy space even more so. Most stocks here are at a third to a quarter of historic EV to EBITDA multiples. Energy weighting of S&P 500 is at an all-time low. We like this space, though it has not been an easy area to be long in. Some shipping stocks like Teekay Corporation (TK) and Golar LNG Ltd. (GLNG) are priced for an asteroid strike. We see a lot of 100% return potentials in both beaten down sectors.David Trainer: The Financials and Consumer Non-cyclicals sectors are currently two of our highest-rated sectors. Financials, specifically, have underperformed over the past five years, which means valuations are well below the overall market. It’s easy to find cheap stocks in this sector, but growth is more difficult to identify. We see opportunity in some regional banks that are priced for permanent profit decline despite a strong track record of recent growth. Our recent Long Idea on Lakeland Financial Corp. (LKFN) is a good example of this sort of opportunity.JD Henning: Value stocks are an important component of my portfolio selections to augment the momentum breakout stocks that are performing well under current market conditions. Since 2018, I have seen strong divergences between high returns and the positive fundamentals that are expected to produce those returns. In fact, as I detailed in a summary article of last year's market results, there was no statistical difference in end of year stock performance between (1) companies with sales and without sales, (2) companies with positive and negative net profits, (3) companies with EPS growth above the median and those below the median EPS growth.While value was undermined greatly last year due to the large market correction in Q4, the continuation of tightening policies from the Fed has affected some results into 2019. Distortions from stock buybacks, more dovish Fed policies, and tariff burdens on certain sectors more than others, all contribute to a mixed return picture on value stocks. Key algorithms like the Piotroski value and Graham enhancement are tested bi-monthly in value portfolios designed to identify areas of attractive value. Currently, in a sector analysis, the financial sector is showing the best correlation with fundamentals as 88% of all the stocks with positive earnings this year are net positive in price YTD. Industrial goods at 81% takes up a strong second place. At the opposite end of the spectrum are healthcare stocks, where only 58% of the net positive stocks year to date have positive earnings. Many factors are contributing to these divergences, and it may be that the healthcare sector is substantially undervalued with the other 42% positive earnings growth stocks ready to deliver strong gains. Technology is near healthcare in this divergence with only 62% of the net positive stocks YTD have positive earnings this year. A shift from momentum toward value may see more of these healthcare and technology stocks gaining in price with more consistency with their positive earnings growth.WG Investment Research: The attractively valued high dividend payers are finally starting to find their footing, especially ever since the Federal Reserve changed their stance on the prospects of an interest rate cut. AT&T is one name that sticks out. This telecom company has been dealing with several self-inflicted wounds, with the DirecTV acquisition being the biggest example, but the stock has performed well over the last few months. The above-average dividend that AT&T pays looks a lot more attractive now with rates hovering around 2%. This is just one example but, overall, I see investors seeking yield and the “safe” high dividend payers appear to be the direct beneficiaries.Value Digger: Value investing is by no means dead, although it's currently a bit out of fashion. Another thing we see is that value investing is not equally spread in all the sectors. I mean that long-term investors can currently find more attractive value stocks in the industrial and energy sectors than in the healthcare sector. We believe that this largely results from the fact that healthcare demand is fairly inelastic and patients are fairly insensitive to changes in healthcare prices.Joseph L. Shaefer: “Why” flows from the two questions above and “what” means positioning into corporate (not K1) energy infrastructure giants, favoring particularly those that also have renewables components; equity income funds, ETFs, and closed-ends that provide both income and growth; neglected-in-this-rally real asset firms (like real estate and metals) that offer both yield and compelling value; and of course, the ever-present special situations that reward only those willing to do the deep research to discover.Andres Cardenal: Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) is a high quality business with rock-solid competitive strengths, strong revenue growth, and impressive profitability. The market is overreacting to regulatory risk, and the stock is trading at a forward adjusted PE ratio below 25. If we include the value of cash and the ""other bets"" segments, we could easily say that Alphabet is deeply undervalued at current prices, especially considering the quality of the company.Chris Lau: In technology, DocuSign (DOCU) recovered faster than I thought while StoneCo (STNE), a DIY member-driven mobile transactions play, continues to reward our members.Dining Stocks Online: We recently upgraded Dave & Buster's (PLAY) after the stock dropped materially after a slight earnings miss and guidance cut. The company has modest leverage, strong free cash flow, and a long runway of new location growth ahead. Trading at a discount to the sector, we like growth companies trading at value stock prices. We believe fair value is between $50 and $60 per share, versus the current price around $40 or so.Eric Nickolaison: From a risk adjusted return perspective, I like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) (BRK.A) - the company that was created to compound at high rates through the use of low cost float. Size is a drag on future returns for BRK, but I believe investors are discounting it too much. The growing pot of deployable cash acts like a hedge against the future economic uncertainty that is vibrating in the market. With a collection of high quality companies and a sound balance sheet, it's akin to a AAA rated bond yielding 8-10%. A very attractive setup for where were at in today's environment.Fred Piard: There is no narrative behind my stock holdings, it's a filtering and ranking process combining several ratios. They may change next week. A few of my ETF holdings may be of interest for investors seeking foreign dividend stock exposure: EFAV (excludes the US and Canada), ENZL (New Zealand), EWA (Australia), EWD (Sweden), EWM (Malaysia). EFAV is my largest position among them. These ETFs have dividends in the 3-5% range.Michael Boyd: China Yuchai (CYD). The company has always been a favorite of mine and is primarily a diesel engine manufacturer in China. It trades at near net cash, less than the value of actual cash plus working capital, and has a great underlying business. I toured several of the manufacturing facilities in mainland China a couple of years ago. This isn't stolen American IP; the tech here is internally-developed products designed to meet new stricter Chinese emission standards. Buying the company today essentially gets you that business - which generates substantial profits - for free. Best of all, the company has a loose dividend policy and has paid out quite a bit in recent years. The annual dividend was recently declared and works out to better than 6% yield given current prices.Ruerd Heeg: A good foreign stock is Cabbeen Fashion, ticker 2030 in Hong Kong. This is a retail fashion chain and cheap based on EV/EBIT and Price/Tangible Book. Multi-year metrics suggest very good earnings and asset allocation quality. And, the business is growing. The company pays a nice dividend.Fear & Greed Trader: I have many names I view as favorites, and they share the same attribute - undervalued: Alibaba (BABA), Goldman Sachs (GS), SYNNEX (SNX), and United Rentals (URI).David Trainer: As noted in our answer to Question 3, Disney (DIS) is one of our top long ideas. Disney is the true content king, not just because it produces more hits than anyone else but also because it monetizes its content better than anyone else. The launch of Disney+ will further demonstrate the power of Disney’s content marketing and distribution. When we say “power”, we mean profits. Disney generated over $20 billion in free cash flow over the last 3 years. For comparison, Netflix lost over $10 billion over the same time frame. Despite Disney’s dominance in content creation, the market’s valuation currently implies that Netflix will surpass it as the most profitable content company in the world over the next decade. As it becomes clearer that Disney will win the content war (Netflix is already looking to cut back on content spending), we expect to see Netflix’s valuation decrease sharply, and much of that capital will continue to flow to Disney. We believe DIS will continue to outperform, and due to its cheap valuation, we see significant potential upside for Disney. If Disney can earn the same ROIC from the Fox acquisition as it has for the rest of its business (12%) and grow organic revenue by 6% compounded annually over the next decade, the stock is worth $189/share today, a 34% upside to the current stock price. Even this scenario might prove too pessimistic. After all, it only implies a 12% compounded annual NOPAT growth rate, which is below the company’s historical average. If Disney can grow NOPAT by 17% compounded annually over the next decade, equal to its historical growth rate, the stock has a fair value of $330/share today, a 135% upside to the current stock price.JD Henning: TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD) is one of my current favorite picks among large cap, lower volatility selections. The financial sector is currently among one of the top momentum sectors based on a number of key characteristics including high net inflows. Consider:These conditions are ideal for the financial sector, and it seems clear that brokerage services will stay in high demand. Specific to TD Ameritrade, the company maintains low debt levels, high cash flows, great margins, and a surging EPS Q/Q of 86.8% combined to deliver excellent value. Further increasing share values is a management team that has reduced shares outstanding by more than 17 million from last year. In addition, TD Ameritrade is backing trading platform ErisX that just received licensing last week by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to offer digital asset futures contracts, i.e. cryptocurrency derivative trading. This very hot segment in the regulated derivatives market will be launched later this year and is sure to bring additional gains to the brokerage services and share price of AMTD.WG Investment Research: People that follow me on Seeking Alpha know how much I like Bank of America (BAC) at today’s price, so I will not bore everyone by restating the same thesis that I have spelled out several times over the last few months. Simply put, I believe that this bank is attractively valued and it has the potential to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders over the next 2-3 years. This bank is by far my favorite idea in the large-cap space.For the small-cap space, I believe that Teladoc (TDOC) is a true hidden gem. This telehealth company has been disrupting the way people consume healthcare, and I believe that there is no looking back. Teladoc is still early in its growth cycle and, in my opinion, over the next decade this company will either be: (1) acquired at a significantly higher market cap or (2) a $20B+ standalone company that is the market leader in the telehealth industry. In either case, shareholders will be happy about owning Teladoc at current levels.Value Digger: One of our current favorite ideas is going short on Wayfair (W). Specifically, we recently recommended our subscribers short W at $148 per share or higher. W's business model has a bunch of negatives, as presented in detail to our subscribers. Among others, W has an ugly mix of losses, negative adjusted EBITDA, cash burn, and shrinking margins, which can't be offset by its YoY revenue growth.Joseph L. Shaefer: Texas Pacific Land Trust (TPL). My thesis is that you buy value, not price, and TPL is heavy with poorly-reflected value that will only grow. To the issue of value vs. price: was Amazon (AMZN) “overpriced” at $1,000 per share? Was Berkshire Hathaway? In my opinion, the Permian Basin will be the most prolific energy play ever, in the best state and country in which to own energy assets, and with the highest probability of being able to turn those assets into earnings, revenue, and dividends.Lejun James Shao: I am still buying beaten down stocks for possible future multi-bagger return. Uxin Limited (NASDAQ:UXIN) is one of my top picks, IPO'd at $9.00 and now trading at the $2.00 level. China's second-hand car market is huge and is still in its early stage of development. The company is still struggling in search of a way, which can lead to its profitability. I will wait for this day to arrive.***Thanks to our panel for participating!

4271035,105265,2019-06-19T11:03:17-04:00,"We provide a summary of Teladoc's attractive business fundamentals and comment on its addressable market.We value Teladoc with a simple top-down model, and we assess its historical relative valuation.We discuss reasons for the pullback since October 2018 and explain that the issues are transitory.We provide catalysts for price appreciation and comment on relevant risks.We conclude with a Buy recommendation with a long-term horizon.","Teladoc Health (TDOC) stands to benefit from the ongoing shift in healthcare to telemedicine and has a massive untapped addressable market. The Company provides widely accessible care at affordable prices, targeting to solve the main challenges facing US healthcare. Its scalable platform based model is favorable to investors due to high gross margins and subscription-based revenues. We believe that now is a great time to buy as the valuation is attractive due to transitory issues. We see earnings and announcement of new clients as potential short-term catalysts. We recommend investors buy and hold for the long-term adding on dips.Teladoc is the market-defining telemedicine service. It offers a full spectrum of clinical conditions from non-critical, episodic care to chronic, complicated cases as well as a wide range of services such as telehealth solutions, expert medical services, behavioral health solutions, guidance and support, and platform & program services (source: 2018 Annual Report). Teladoc is the first and only comprehensive and integrated virtual healthcare solution provider.Teladoc's wide scope and user-friendly platform drive best-in-class utilization rates. Telehealth utilization amongst large employers in the US in 2018 was at a mere 2.5%, while the comparable number for Teladoc clients was at 9.4% (source: National Business Group on Health 2018 survey on page 5 of 2018 Annual Report). The high utilization rate grows over time thanks to cross-selling opportunities. Teladoc showcases this well with the chart below. This is a fundamental positive of the business model as it both increases stickiness and enables easier top line growth. We say easier because we presume cross-selling into an existing base to be cheaper than onboarding new clients.Source: William Blair 39th Annual Growth Stock Conference PresentationTeladoc generates most of its revenues on a recurring basis. ~84% of its revenues come from subscriptions, typically on a per-member-per-month basis. The rest of revenue comes from clients with visit fee only arrangements on a per-visit basis (source: Teladoc 1Q2019 Earnings Release). This favorable shift of recurring revenue allows high revenue visibility and thus capital efficiency and is generally awarded a higher multiple by the market.The platform-based model allows high gross margins and is highly scalable. As Teladoc grows its top line, its bottom line will be disproportionally affected as R&D and overhead will increase less than the top line.Due to the attractive business model, Teladoc has been decreasing its cash burn over time and has a net cash balance sheet. It turned operating cash flow positive for TTM 2019 Q1 and narrowed its free cash flow burn to ~$8 mn (source: Gurufocus). This is very unique for an early-stage disruptor and is essentially the reflection of the attractiveness of the business fundamentals.Teladoc's revenue is fairly GDP-independent. Healthcare plans are unlikely to churn due to economic downturns and even if they do, they are likely to incorporate more telehealth due to cheaper access. A downturn in the employment market may impact results somewhat but will be offset by under-penetration of telemedicine. Subscription-based healthcare revenue is as safe as revenue gets, in our opinion. Per-visit revenue, however, may be at risk but it only contributed 16% to Teladoc's top line in 2018. Teladoc's growth is as defensive as it is fast.Virtual healthcare addresses critical inefficiencies faced by the healthcare system. Overhaul of the healthcare system is widely accepted by both parties in the US, how to address the problem is the topic of discussion. Teladoc shapes the problem very well in its 2018 Annual Report:In short, the industry is not just open to disruption but in dire need of it. Telehealth solves pretty much all of these problems in most cases as it offers affordable care to a wide audience. As the leading provider, Teladoc will be the pioneering trailblazer of the future of healthcare.Experts paint a very pretty picture for the future of the telemedicine market as well. Global Market Insights estimates the current market size as ~$38 bn and expects it to reach ~$130 bn by 2025. According to GMI, roughly half of the current market is in the US and will stay that way to 2025 (source: Global Market Insights). Teladoc is more conservative in their total addressable market estimation of ~$57 bn. They calculate $28 bn for expert opinion, $17 bn for ambulatory care, and $12 bn for behavioral health markets (source: William Blair 38th Annual Growth Stock Conference Presentation). It's hard to quantify the exact amount but suffice to say that the market will see massive growth in the coming years.We present a picture of a Teladoc when telehealth reaches near-full penetration and discount it to today to arrive at an approximate fair value. We use the market size of Teladoc as it is the more conservative option and that's what we want to be in our bull thesis. It is difficult to discern current market share but we've found an estimate of 75% from 2017 (source: Zacks). Again, to be conservative, we use a much lower number and deem 20% as appropriate.In estimating Teladoc's future financials, we look at its platform as a service big brothers. Our peer group is Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOG). We find that they are very similar mainly due to two reasons: 1) their product is also a scalable platform benefiting from network effects and 2) they need to keep investing in technology and security much like Teladoc will. One caveat is that we're projecting a near-full telehealth penetration but these names are still growing very rapidly. We're OK with this issue as it makes our estimation more conservative. We look at TTM 2019 Q1 SG&A and R&D expenditures as a percentage of sales and take the average of the sum of OPEX which gives us ~39%. We then do the same with difference from EBITDA to Net Income and calculate ~12%. We calculate Teladoc's financials by subtracting the estimated 39% OPEX from long-term management guided 65% gross margin and calculate long-term ~26% EBITDA margin. To calculate Net Income margin, we subtract the calculated 12% of costs from the EBITDA margin to arrive at 14%.Source: GurufocusTo calculate appropriate multiples for our analysis, we look at historicals of the S&P 500 healthcare group. We take median PE and EV/EBITDA as a sample at the end of every 6-month interval for a three-year period from 2016 to 2018. For PE, we use PE of XLV ETF from Gurufocus yielding ~24x and for EV/EBITDA we use data from Siblis Research yielding 14.2x.Source: Gurufocus and Siblis Research (detailed in article), Freyr visualizationDespite the Global Market Insights forecast of a much larger market size than the one we use by 2025, we allow 15 years for Teladoc to reach this size in our effort to be conservative. 15 years is also appropriate as it amounts to 24% CAGR growth which is at the middle of management's long-term guidance range of 20-30% (source: Yahoo Finance). We use a 7% discount rate over the time period. Teladoc has issued ~10 mn shares a year over the recent years. Realistically, we expect this to decrease drastically over the coming years. Teladoc should become a net buyer of shares in the second half of the time range. But again, we assume a conservatively high 5 mn share issue yearly for 15 years to grow the end of 2018 share count of ~66 mn to ~141 mn.Source: FreyrCrunching the numbers gives us an EV/EBITDA based target stock price of ~$110 or ~80% upside and PE-based target stock price of ~99 or ~63% upside with conservative estimates. We would argue for upside in this analysis - 1) Teladoc long-term market share should be greater than 20%, 2) given the need for a healthcare solution, this growth should take much less than 15 years, and 3) as noted above, it is very unlikely that Teladoc will dilute as much for as long. Even in our pessimistic scenario, we calculate large upside pointing to excellent risk/reward in the name.Teladoc is currently trading at the low end of its recent multiple range presenting a good entry point, historically speaking. The multiple of the stock is pretty volatile as can be seen on the chart below. Despite our belief in long term investing in quality businesses, the low entry multiple combined with the high volatility makes the equity suitable for short-term traders as well.Source: GurufocusTeladoc stock halved from ~$86 to ~$43 before settling around the current ~$60ish range. The cause for this was, in our opinion, many temporary issues all, unfortunately, conspiring simultaneously.Teladoc has been placed on ""Corrective Action Status"" by the NCQA (source: Seeking Alpha). This seems to be top of mind for some shorts (E.g. The Friendly Bear's article Teladoc: Significant Near-Term Contract Risk After NCQA Corrective Action Debacle). We believe that this is a non-event, however. Teladoc has been through this process multiple times before and is in the process of being re-accredited. The management expects as such per their commentary in their 1Q2019 Earnings Call Transcript:There's been some concern (e.g. David Trainer's article Why Incentivizing Executives With Adjusted EBITDA Is Problematic) about the Company's use of adjusted EBITDA brought forward by an article on Forbes. We point out that almost all companies use an adjusted earnings metric and Teladoc is in no way dissimilar. We believe that high growth companies that need to keep investing in their business should use an adjusted operating metric as well as those that conduct significant M&A. Teladoc is both. Its operating metrics would be absolutely incomparable without the adjustment. The Forbes author also mentions the use of adjusted EBITDA in compensation. We argue that this is appropriate as it incentivizes profitability of a ""steady-state"" Teladoc and points out that the rest of the compensation (i.e. 70%) is tied to revenue growth (source: SEC). The author also implies that the growth is mainly due to M&A. Acquisitions did assist in growing the top line but organic revenue CAGR from 2014 to 2018 was nevertheless a dizzying 29% at the high end of Teladoc's long-term 20% to 30% target (source: Yahoo Finance).There's been concern on Teladoc's compensation of YouTube influencers in promoting its behavioral health service BetterHelp (e.g. The Friendly Bear's article Vulnerable Patients Exposed To 'Growth At Any Cost' Culture). We note that YouTube channel generates less than 5% of BetterHelp's new subscribers and BetterHelp makes less than 15% of Teladoc revenue (source: Motley Fool). 1Q2019 Earnings Call Transcript illuminates this issue as well with the following: ""Demko: …And safe to say that there has been a little impact on the YouTube controversy? Gorevic: Yes, I would say virtually none."" We believe this to be another non-event.All these events lead the short sellers to pile on the stock resulting in ~28% short float.High short interest can close very quickly benefiting the invested. Below is a chart of Teladoc's short interest and price for the past 3 years. Peak short interest seems to precede price appreciation in the following 3 to 6 months. We have had a short peak in January but are yet to see the price pick up. We believe the following events can catalyze our proposed rally.Source: Gurufocus, Freyr analysisDetails on the situation of key accounts and onboarding of new customers can boost revenue expectations. It's been a while since we've had a development on the CVS (NYSE:CVS) rollout and what the strategy will be on the new CVS-Aetna merger. We expect an announcement of a CVS roll out aided by Teladoc's relationship with Aetna. We also expect better than expected revenue from the combination of the two as part of cost-cutting efforts of the merged entity which will prioritize telehealth. Aetna is Teladoc's largest health plan relationship. We're similarly positive on the Centene (NYSE:CNC)-WellCare (NYSE:WCG) acquisition. Teladoc expanded its relationship with Superior Health Plan of Centene (source: Superior Health Plan), and we expect them to penetrate further into the combined entity. There's lots of potential for high profile revenue announcements.Teladoc should show stellar execution with pace of adoption of telehealth increasing and the Company leading the way. As noted above, Teladoc's revenue isn't really tied to GDP. A beat and raise quarter in a slowing economy would deem Teladoc a proven defensive growth name and thus boost investor sentiment.As the Company isn't profitable yet, the stock price can be very volatile. We see these potential blips as opportunities as opposed to risks as they provide good entry points. We believe in the Teladoc model and are buyers in dips.Teladoc's business model shifting away from subscription-based revenue could erode investor sentiment and thus its multiple. We think that this is unlikely as a subscription-based model provides visibility for and is beneficial to both parties of the transaction. If such a shift occurs, it would most likely be due to Teladoc making a strategic decision and sacrificing revenue visibility for revenue growth. We have confidence in the decision making of the management and believe that they would only make such a decision if they saw long-term value. And if they see long-term value in such a shift, they most definitely should execute.Competition risk comes to mind, but we don't see it as a big risk. We think that Teladoc has too big of an advantage in terms customer penetration, serving 40% of Fortune 500 companies (source: 2018 Annual Report), in terms of technology and in terms of scope of offering. We view the case of a potential entrant stealing Teladoc share or convincing new businesses to not choose Teladoc in its shift to telehealth as extremely unlikely. We do view, however, a potential entrant to the market acquiring Teladoc. Such transaction should occur at a price at least at our calculated values, providing lucrative gains to investors.Regulation is always a significant risk in healthcare. Telehealth is the wild west of the industry and will see new regulation which may hurt Teladoc. We think that Teladoc is very beneficial for the consumer and that it is unlikely that regulators will hurt its business as it solves critical issues faced by the system.Most high growth names are exposed to the global business cycle. We view Teladoc as the contrary. Teladoc's revenue would not change in a down cycle if anything it would increase as it provides cheaper services than traditional solutions. We think that this is a very critical aspect of Teladoc's business and is often overlooked by investors.We are rated Buy on Teladoc with a long-term time horizon. Our conviction in the name is based on the untapped large addressable market and it addressing major issues facing global health services. We are very bullish on the technology and are confident in management execution. We believe that headwinds facing the company are transitory and have created an attractive entry point. We expect a bullish rotation in investor sentiment due to potential high profile client onboarding and solid execution."
4264578,83086,2019-05-16T10:15:03-04:00,"On May 15, NCQA placed Teladoc on “Corrective Action Status” - yet another blow to the company’s already tarnished credibility.
        Industry sources familiar with NCQA told us that ""corrective actions"" are highly unusual and only issued in serious situations given the reputational repercussions for the target company.
        Teladoc clearly once believed its NCQA score mattered - it has touted its NCQA ""perfect score"" in marketing materials but has already begun to roll back this claim (see article).
        Can investors trust the CEO who claimed Teladoc’s relationship with Aetna is strong when just two weeks ago he claimed that NCQA’s delay was “much ado about nothing”?
        Why would naturally risk-averse insurers want to do business with Teladoc when it is the only major telehealth company on a NCQA “Corrective Action Status”?","Recent developments at Teladoc (TDOC) relating to its credentialing status lead us to believe that the company is likely to see significant contract losses in upcoming months. We believe the market does not understand the weight of recent NCQA developments, in part because the sell side a) only started analyzing Teladoc's NCQA issues after our first report, and b) has largely relied on management's representations as it pertains to NCQA. While the market took yesterday's Corrective Action announcement in stride, we note that Teladoc is now significantly disadvantaged versus its competitors. Teladoc once proudly stated that it was ""first telehealth company to receive NCQA Certification"". Today, Teladoc is the only major telehealth company that has been placed on NCQA Corrective Action Status.Teladoc's 2013 NCQA Certification was a pivotal moment in telehealth history because it moved telehealth into the mainstream by providing a stamp of quality approval. Times have certainly changed. How does the first ever NCQA Certified telehealth company fall so far from grace? What happened to quality standards at the company since its first accreditation in 2013? It is worth remembering that NCQA is a 501(c)(3) that collects dues from Teladoc. NCQA's 2013 decision to certify Teladoc was significant. At the time, NCQA stuck its neck out and ""blessed"" telehealth through Teladoc's certification. All of these factors suggest that going into this year's exam, NCQA was likely predisposed positively on Teladoc. Its decision to place a Corrective Action Status on Teladoc is therefore highly noteworthy and begs the question of what NCQA found.Quality and reputation are paramount for a healthcare company. We think Teladoc's valuation has not appropriately discounted the damage that the NCQA outcome will have on Teladoc's reputation. We believe that the company is likely facing significant contract risk with existing and new clients. We also believe that management is being less than forthcoming about these risks as they have provided absolutely no color to the market on their NCQA status and its basis.We previously highlighted that Teladoc has been playing games with its disclosure language around its NCQA status in an article from last month showing that for the first time ever, Teladoc removed all mentions of NCQA from its SEC filings. At the time, the company attributed the change to the “global” nature of its business and shot down any concerns relating to NCQA. In fact, on the April 30 earnings call, Teladoc’s CEO Jason Gorevic shot down any notion that there may be problems with Teladoc’s NCQA credential, stating that the delayed examination was “much ado about nothing”. He also claimed that the delay was only 2-weeks when our own Wayback Machine analysis shows that Teladoc was due for renewal at the end of March 2019 – suggesting a 6-week delay. The market took comfort from Gorevic’s position that there were no problems with Teladoc’s NCQA credential.Teladoc has now been placed “Under Corrective Action” with another review set for 11/18/19.Source: Teladoc’s NCQA Report Card NCQA defines “under corrective action” as the NCQA “confirming if performance is at the level required for accreditation” (you can see this by hitting the information button adjacent to the status modifier).The NCQA “seal of approval” is also now notably missing from Teladoc’s report card. That fact, combined with the language above, suggests that Teladoc is not fully “accredited”.By that standard, it appears Gorevic’s claim on the earnings call that Teladoc would be accredited is at the very least a challengeable statement subject to significant scrutiny.Why does this all matter?Based on yesterday’s trading, it appears that Teladoc bulls have jumped for joy at the company being placed on probation by the NCQA, viewing probation as a positive. We wonder how bulls could even view Teladoc as “investible” at this stage after the company’s demonstrated history of significant disclosure problems. We have spoken with industry sources who are familiar with NCQA processes and procedures who have indicated that the NCQA’s decision to put Teladoc on a corrective plan is not taken lightly – and that the NCQA is well aware of the optics issues that the corrective action creates for Teladoc. Teladoc will now have to compete against players that are all fully and appropriately NCQA Certified. Teladoc will also likely have to explain to customers why they were put on probation. We suspect that as these bulls do work and make calls – and recognize that the NCQA almost never places organizations on probation, let alone $4B publicly traded companies – they will come to realize that Teladoc is likely having very painful conversations with existing and new customers relating to exactly why they – unlike their competitors – could not reach full NCQA accreditation status.Even bulls should know that there is nothing proprietary or special about Teladoc’s network of doctors – competitors can all offer similar services. So why would insurers want to partner with Teladoc when it is effectively the only large scale Telehealth company with NCQA problems?Through FOIA, we have also seen riders like the one below for Teladoc contracts that demonstrate the company must adhere to NCQA standards:Source: San Francisco Health Plan Teladoc Contract (retrieved via FOIA)Given that the NCQA has now publicly indicated it is still determining whether Teladoc meets NCQA certification requirements, the clause above requiring adherence to NCQA standards could create significant problems for Teladoc from a payor perspective. The clause above is significant because it demonstrates that actual contracts Teladoc enters into value the NCQA. Teladoc’s inability to get a clean NCQA accreditation is therefore a real risk for Teladoc, and one that Teladoc provided no risk factor disclosure around in its SEC filings. We therefore believe that customers will want answers from Teladoc as to what is going on with their NCQA accreditation and why – after having it dating back to 2013 – they were not able to get through this exam without ending up on a corrective action status.And for the Teladoc bulls who somehow view this probationary period as a positive, we note that every one of Teladoc’s major competitors is fully accredited (meaning, unlike Teladoc, competitors such as Doctors on Demand, MDLive, and American Well are all accredited without any corrective action stipulations). A report card search on the NCQA website demonstrates this point – in fact, Teladoc’s report card page does not even include the “NCQA Certification” logo as is apparent on all of the competitor report cards.Teladoc is already going through the process of making changes to their marketing materials to dial back claims around doctor quality. When you are in the business of providing doctor consulting services, isn’t doctor quality the single most important variable?Retrieved 5/15/19 MorningSource: TeladocRetrieved 5/15/19 Early Afternoon:Source: TeladocThe process of unwinding prior marketing claims will not be easy, however. The website below still claims that the company earned a “perfect score from the NCQA for two consecutive certifications” and still has a 5-star rating below the NCQA decal:Source: Teladoc, retrieved 5/15/19We reiterate the same point we have made in the past. Teladoc is highly vulnerable. The company still has no full-time CFO, and even sell side analysts were confused by the bizarre numerical earnings guidance that the company’s CEO provided on the call. The CEO also claimed he saw no problems with Teladoc’s doctor credentialing just two weeks ago. Flash forward, and Teladoc has gone from being the first telehealth company with an NCQA Certification to the only major telehealth company with an NCQA Corrective Action problem. This is all happening in public and competitors are not clueless – they are likely to aggressively target Teladoc contracts that are up for rebid or even existing Teladoc business. Furthermore, Teladoc has provided no color or clarity to the market as to why they ended up on a Corrective Action Status. Nor has the company provided any color on the representations it has made to insurers and other client payors. Again, why would customers want to partner with Teladoc when it is the only major telehealth player with publicly apparent NCQA credentialing problems?And to be clear, Teladoc historically very proudly touted its NCQA ""perfect scores"" as a clear selling point with customers as can be seen in examples such as here, here, here. These claims will now have to be dialed back. The company will have to go through a costly and painful process of revising marketing documents and disclaimers.We raise these examples to drive home the point - clearly Teladoc's marketing messaging centered around its NCQA Certification. The company owes investors far more disclosure on what is going on at the company and what caused the company to end up on the highly unusual and irregular Corrective Action Status."

Teladoc Health (TDOC) remains one of the best ways to play virtual medicine now that the company is all grown up and the stock valuation is more reasonable.Image Source: Teladoc Health websiteOver the last couple of years, Teladoc has made big acquisitions via Best Doctors and Advance Medical that have helped the company reach a scale to where revenues will top $500 million this year. Ambitions of being a global telemedicine provider require substantial scale in order to profitably deliver the best services to patients.For this reason, Teladoc reported a massive 2018 loss of $98.1 million and a headline Q1 loss of $0.43 per share. Investor interest will fade fast with ongoing losses so high.Source: Seeking Alpha newsDigging into the numbers, adjusted EBITDA showed far better results with a 2018 gain of $13.4 million. Even the Q1 results showed a shift from an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.4 million to a gain of $1.2 million for a $2.6 million improvement over the year.Source: Teladoc Health Q1'19 earnings releaseThe guidance for 2019 is even better with a target for adjusted EBITDA to at least double this year to $25 million to $35 million. The headline losses are actually highly misleading due to substantial amortization expenses and stock-based compensation.Removing the $23 million in non-cash charges related to amortization, acquisition and integrated costs and SBC would cut the net loss from the substantial reported level of $30 million down to only $7 million. The vast majority of the adjusted quarterly losses ends up being the $6.5 million in interest expenses Teladoc paid during the quarter.So while the company appears in this major expense phase, Teladoc is actually using high gross margins to virtually break even from an operating standpoint. The quarterly losses are closer to $0.10 based on 72 million shares outstanding.As the virtual care provider starts generating positive EBITDA, investors can start to focus on how the business is growing organic revenues close to a 25% clip. The company is achieving this growth based in part on the ability to drive increased utilization by customers via new services and the average person becoming more comfortable with the virtual care concept.According to data from Teladoc towards the end of 2018, patients on the platform since 2014 have more than doubled their utilization rates of that first year in 2014. Also, utilization from the 2014 cohort is double that of the 2017 cohort that has been on the platform already for over a year as 2018 comes to an end.Source: Teladoc Health J.P. Morgan Healthcare presentationThe real question is how much somebody is willing to pay for a growing platform that offers the telemedicine options of the future. With the company having operating cash flows close to breakeven despite the headline losses, the market should actually find the stock more appealing now.Teladoc got to very expensive levels based on future revenue multiples last year when the stock hit an incredible high of $89. The company is clearly more appealing now, and the stock dip back into the $50s makes the deal so much better.Data by YChartsThe combination of time elapsing and the stock down at $58 makes Teladoc an appealing way to invest in the all but certain future delivery method for healthcare. The stock only trades at about 6.2x '20 revenue estimates of $677 million.The key investor takeaway is that Teladoc Health actually generates decent quarterly financials despite the headlines that focus on large losses. The stock is a bargain down in the $50s as the company has exited the hype cycle that occurred in 2018."
4253344,79675,2019-04-08T13:16:46-04:00,"Teladoc Health recently announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire a European telemedicine provider and that it had plans to expand into Canada.The stock is not cheap, but I do not believe that Teladoc's growth prospects are fully baked into the price.I am long Teladoc Health, and I plan to stay long the stock.","Teladoc Health's (NYSE:TDOC) stock has underperformed the broader market so far in 2019, but shares have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (SPY) over the last year.Data by YChartsThere are plenty of reasons to like Teladoc in today's environment - read this latest article for my thoughts on the company's bull case - but I believe that the recent announcements related to management's expansion plans should get investors even more excited about what the future may hold for this growing, disruptive company.On March 19, 2019, Teladoc agreed to acquire MedecinDirect, a Paris-based telemedicine service provider. The acquisition not only expands Teladoc's global reach, but it also brings several valuable virtual care services into the fold.MedecinDirect is a market leader (partnerships with 40 of the leading insurance companies and almost 50% of the top 30 private medical insurers) with a well-established management team. Teladoc will have operations in the U.K., Australia, Canada (more on this below), Spain, Portugal, Hungary, China, Chile and Brazil so France will soon be added to a growing list. This acquisition is expected to help fuel Teladoc's global reach, which is a key driver to management's long-term strategy.The news only got better when Teladoc announced that it launched telemedicine services in Canada, which will be the first company to offer these types of services in the country.The MedecinDirect and Canada expansion news shows that management is serious about expanding services outside of the U.S. Yes, it is not a foregone conclusion that Teladoc will be successful with its international investments but, to me, this management team is taking steps in the right direction. It is entirely too early to determine what the recent acquisitions will mean for Teladoc's results over the next 12 months, but I do believe that the news is meaningful if you consider the company's long-term growth strategy.In late-February 2018, Teladoc reported a Q4 2018 loss per share of $0.35 (beat by $0.01) on revenue of $122.7M (beat by $2.7M), which also compares favorably to the year-ago quarter.Source: Q4 and Full-Year 2018 Earnings Press ReleaseIt was not Teladoc's results that caused the stock to drop by an almost double-digit figure, but instead it was management's forward guidance that was not well received by the market.Source: Q4 and Full-Year 2018 Earnings Press ReleaseThe Street was looking for adjusted EBITDA to be $42M (significantly higher than the guidance of $25M-$35M), but in my opinion, there is a lot to like about how Teladoc is positioned for 2019 and beyond. The expansion news covered above has the potential to be a growth driver, but let us also not forget that this company still has a significant market opportunity that is expanding by the day.Source: William Blair 38th Annual Growth Stock Conference, June 2018Additionally, there is another potential catalyst that could materialize in 2019.The Motley Fool recently floated the idea of the newly created Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), JPMorgan (JPM) and Amazon (AMZN) healthcare joint venture, Haven, teaming up with Teladoc Health and, in my opinion, this rumor makes a ton of sense. Not only would a Teladoc-Haven tie-up allow for the newly created entity to expand its reach in short order, but I believe that it would also create an opportunity to cut out unnecessary costs, which is a key strategic goal for Haven's management team.Additionally, it is early, and this is complete speculation, but in my mind, an outright acquisition of Teladoc would put Haven in a great position to achieve the main goal of being a truly distributive company in the healthcare industry.After the recent pullback, Teladoc's stock is trading at reasonable levels based on its own historical metrics.Data by YChartsThe stock is not cheap by any means, but I also do not believe that the potential growth is fully baked into the stock price either.Investing in small-cap companies comes with many risks, but the major risk for Teladoc is related to the company being outspent by larger competitors. Additionally, the company relies heavily on its partnerships to expand its business, so deteriorating relationships in the industry could have a material impact on Teladoc's business.In addition, integration risk needs to be considered given the numerous acquisitions that have been made over the last few years. And most importantly, regulatory changes have the potential to greatly impact Teladoc's business. Please also refer to the 2018 10-K for additional risk factors that should be considered before investing in the company.Additionally, as described here, the COO/CFO departure definitely adds risk to the story. And finally, some pundits have raised concerns about management using non-GAAP metrics, as outlined in a recent Forbes article, but I do not believe that this is a significant risk factor. I would, however, monitor this recent development because it has the potential to eventually turn into something more serious that may warrant attention.In my mind, Teladoc Health will either grow into a significantly disruptive company in the healthcare industry or it will get acquired by a larger player. Either way, it is a win-win situation for investors. Moreover, I believe that the recent expansion news will speed up Teladoc's growth, which should help propel the stock price higher in 2019. TDOC's shares will likely not go up in a straight line, but in my opinion, the risk is to the upside if you are in it for the long haul."

While strong profits are still not within sight, management has promised that they will be cash flow positive for their fiscal year 2019 (slide 106).Teladoc's revenues have grown at a CAGR of 75% over the last five years, which has drawn the skeptical eyes of many short sellers and bulls alike. In that same time period, organic revenue only grew at a CAGR of 29%, and if you dig deeper into their filings, you'll find stats that dampen the growth party to an even greater extent, like the paltry U.S. subscription growth.

Additionally, citizens who are enrolled in medicaid likely cannot often afford transportation. For both of these reasons, telemedicine offers a perfect solution, from which Teladoc seems poised to profit.Teladoc's gross margins are actually quite good. Their cost of goods sold as a percentage of their revenues has stood at about 30-35% annually.Source: Teladoc's 3rd Quarter 10-QTeladoc's 3rd quarter 10-Q reveals that they're spending aggressively on ""Advertising and Marketing"", ""Sales"", and ""Technology and Development""; the amount of which has ballooned massively, or at least proportionately, to their revenues.This may seem normal on the surface, but some short sellers have taken great issue with the methods by which Teladoc has been executing their ad and marketing campaigns. I discuss the ad spend and marketing techniques in greater depth later in this article, and I would highly recommend any potential investor to read the link provided in this paragraph.The acquisitions of HealthiestYou, Best Doctors, Advance Medical have increased revenues as well as global reach. The latest acquisition of Advance Medical has given it a global exposure, which should enable it to harness the international markets.Source: Teladoc Investor Day Presentation (9/27/18)There are a few points of note to mention with respect to the above graph. 1) Teladoc's behavior health arm is predominantly composed of their controversial app known as ""BetterHelp"". 2) This is the best I can find regarding all of their individual acquisition's contributions to their overall sales, which, from my viewpoint, is damaging to their overall narrative, and the lack of transparency gives the short sellers fodder for their own narratives.With the data Teladoc provides, we can infer that these acquisitions have contributed to overall sales growth, but to what extent has each contributed? Is BetterHelp generating the majority of its revenues bolstered by aggressive ad campaigns on the backs of YouTubers who no longer want to be associated with the company? These questions regarding Teladoc's revenues have created speculation and uncertainty around the entire company's narrative.Teladoc's top line has been growing astronomically due in large part to the aforementioned acquisitions. While their financial performance lately would excite many an investor, despite the company having not turned a GAAP basis profit yet, serious concerns have arisen regarding their revenues and the quality thereof.Quality of revenues remains uncertainThe primary thesis of the short seller referenced in the above link is that their subscription access fee growth (their primary organic revenue driver) is coming from an app known as ""BetterHelp"". Essentially, BetterHelp provides on-demand therapy services via an app on a phone or computer.The aforementioned bear stated that he or she believed that the BetterHelp mental health services services have been ineffective, but due to Teladoc's massive marketing campaign, they've been able to generate massive low quality revenue in a relatively short period of time of about 3 years.In his article, he writes, ""Teladoc acquired BetterHelp in January 2015 in order to enter the mental health market. Since the acquisition, BetterHelp revenues have exploded from almost zero to a projected $60 million in FY18.""Teladoc released in 2015 information regarding their BetterHelp acquisition.""In January 2015, we completed the acquistion of BetterHelp, a provider of direct-to-consumer, behavioral health services for $3.5 million in cash.""BetterHelp's revenues are nearly impossible to determine, as the company has reduced the transparency with which they report their revenues, making it harder to follow the paper trail of sales.In an attempt to gain some clarity as to BetterHelp's contributions to the company's financials, I scoured a couple of their latest 10-Qs.Here's what I found:For Teladoc's 2018 2nd Quarter 10-Q, the company reported ""Visit Fee Revenue"" as defined as ""U.S. General Medical, Dermatology, and Behavioral Health"". Now recall that Teladoc stated in 2015, ""...we completed the acquistion of BetterHelp, a provider of direct-to-consumer, behavioral health services..."" Therefore, I feel it's acceptable to assume that their revenue from ""Behavioral Health"", seen below, represents the sales from BetterHelp.Has Teladoc stated as much explicitly? Not that I've read, nor have they alluded to any of it in their Investor Day presentations.Source: Teladoc's 2nd Quarter 10-QNow here's where it gets a little weird, and here's where our fellow Seeking Alpha contributor's indictment of Teladoc gains even more credibility.Source: Teladoc's 3rd Quarter 10-QTeladoc has actually reduced its transparency, despite criticism and skepticism regarding their revenues. As can be seen above, they no longer report their Visit Fee Revenue as ""U.S. General Medical, Dermatology and Behavioral Health"".So now more questions arise: Teladoc claims that ""For the Company’s direct-to-consumer behavioral health product, members purchase access to the Company’s professional provider network for a subscription access fee.""Based on that quote alone, it seems we could assume that Teladoc's ""Subscription Access Fees"" revenue account for BetterHelp's sales. But in the 2018 2nd Quarter 10-Q, Behavioral Health revenue was a sub-revenue to ""Visit Fee Revenue"".Why did Teladoc stop reporting their ""Visit Fee Revenue"" with sub categories? Why wasn't behavior health represented under ""Subscription Access Fees"", and why was it represented under ""Visit Fee Revenue"" when it uses the subscription model?Now, I'm far from perfect, and there's a prodigious amount of information one must consume in order to gain clarity as to a company's operations; however, it seems Teladoc either hasn't done a good job in producing quality, easily comprehensible information regarding its revenues, or my SeekingAlpha compatriots and I are missing something.Reduction in revenue reporting transparency furthers uncertaintyIn one sense, Teladoc's high gross margins reassure me as an investor that the business model is one in which to invest; on the other hand, I cannot be sure as to the sustainability or quality of the revenues, as, apparently, the company seems to have something to hide regarding its revenues.In light of the recent Apple news, reduction in reporting transparency is usually a huge red flag.There are numerous risks associated with investing in a company whose earning potential has not been proven and whose business model is still in question. Aside from the financial concerns associated with investing in a company that's losing money, one must also consider the political environment in which a company such as Teladoc operates.The primary risks to investing in the company, from my perspective, are as follows:Perusing the company's 2017 10-K, in which they list their risk factors, will quickly inform you as to the many hurdles the company has had to overcome to achieve compliance with the healthcare laws of the 125 countries where it operates.The ability of a new company to meet its obligations is always of central concern for investors. At present, Teladoc's financial position could be considered a strength; however, investors must consider that they have not had the ability to build cash balances that could shield them from economic uncertainty for long periods of time.The company does maintain a liquid cash position, carrying around a half billion in cash on their balance sheet. Additionally, they have two notes which mature in the 2020s. These notes are convertible, meaning in this instance that the lender has the option to convert under certain circumstances, as delineated in the most recent 10-Q. Additionally, Teladoc has reserved shares for issuance under their convertible debt covenants; therefore, the notes should be converted at a point in the future.Source: Teladoc Investor Day Presentation (9/27/18)Thus, liquidity is no issue for the company for the foreseeable future, and should global political and economic risk send the world's economies into recession, the company should weather the storm with minimal threat to its survival as a going concern.Teladoc's aggressive advertising/sales spend and questionable marketing techniques have called into question the quality of their revenues via a fellow SeekingAlpha contributor's short thesis.The author, who writes riveting and compelling articles which I recommend to any investor considering buying Teladoc, cited certain social media scandals in which Teladoc sponsored content creators to peddle BetterHelp. He continued stating that ""BetterHelp"" now accounts for nearly 70% organic user growth of subscription services and $60 million of overall revenues, the numbers of which don't add up perfectly in my calculations, but nevertheless are compelling.He speculated, and I use that word strongly because either way we look at it Teladoc simply hasn't given us enough data with which to make an informed decision, that revenues should begin to collapse as the social media scandal wrecks the BetterHelp business, which, according to him, makes up $60 million of current revenues.I invite readers to conclude for themselves the validity to his claims. I checked out the BetterHelp app for myself, and after extensive research, found that it's actually a pretty darn unique innovation in mental healthcare. In fact, it inspired the title of this article because I found that its business model is incredibly similar to that of Uber (UBER), the ride hailing app.Though I remain skeptical, actually experiencing BetterHelp's app actually made me more excited to buy shares of Teladoc. Check it out for yourself. It is available in the Google Play store on Android and the App store on IOS.A common threat to Teladoc's business model has been the idea that companies such as CVS and Walgreen's (WBA) will easily replicate its services. It seems that Teladoc has provided the death knell for that bearish thesis through their partnership with CVS' MinuteClinic , although Walgreens did release a competing product called ""Find Care Now"".Teladoc offers a compelling narrative, relatively strong financials, and investment in an industry that is rapidly growing; however, the company still has work to do in order to engender investor confidence. From their lack of financial transparency regarding their sources of growth; to their CFO's recent alleged misconduct; to lawsuits they currently face: there are serious issues within the company that need to be addressed.Additionally, the BetterHelp scandal has been a nightmare for the company, and their alterations to the way in which they report their revenues seems to be a means to get ahead of a decline in revenues from the online mental health service. This is speculation, but Teladoc has not been forthcoming with information regarding the controversies and their impacts on revenues.With all of that being said, I'm a believer in the power that virtual healthcare can bring to consumers and to their employers and to beneficiaries of government sponsored healthcare. The company appears to have backing from the U.S. federal and state governments through their future CMS partnership (shown on slide 13 of the cited presentation), which is set to begin in 2020. Additionally, the company is disrupting a notoriously inefficient industry that has taken advantage of consumers for decades now, similar to the impact Uber has had on the taxi industry.To commit capital to Teladoc today would unequivocally be a speculative wager predicated on future adoption by consumers, acceptance by regulators, and execution of a management that has already created mistrust through its indiscretions.With that being said, I am long TDOC, having built a position that amounts to around 1% of my entire portfolio."
4253595,83086,2019-04-10T10:30:00-04:00,Teladoc has been going through a prolonged NCQA assessment that is a) concerning given TDOC has been credentialed since 2013 and b) not on the radar of retail shareholders.Teladoc pulled all language from its 10-K relating to its NCQA certification in February 2019; this is highly unusual because it appeared repeatedly in all prior 10-Ks and the prospectus.Teladoc has a history of omitting key information from investor documents - i.e. the company covered up its prior CFO's improper workplace relationship (that occurred in the credentialing division).We conducted our own analysis and found problems with Teladoc paperwork pertaining to some of its off balance sheet physician entities.Any NCQA issues could have major reputational implications for TDOC and couldn't come at a worse time as Aetna is up for renewal.,"When companies make drastic changes to the language in their securities filings without explanation, investors should take notice. For example, in December 2016 Teladoc quietly amended its former CFO's employment agreement. Two years later, the market discovered these subtle amendments were likely tied to his improper workplace conduct. The latest change in Teladoc's financial disclosures that has gone unnoticed - and that could have even more draconian consequences for Teladoc - pertains to the company's NCQA credential - a status that has significant reputational significance to Teladoc.Notably missing from Teladoc's most recent 10-K was a bullet point on page 6 of the prior year 10-K under Our Competitive Strengths, titled ""High Quality Provider Network"". In fact, you will not even find that term if you search through the FY18 Teladoc 10-K. The NCQA is a non-profit that is a well-established and regarded body that provides quality assessments for healthcare related organizations. According to NCQA (p8), plans certified by their organization cover ~70% of Americans enrolled in healthcare plans.We believe retail shareholders have been left completely in the dark relating to Teladoc's prolonged delay re-upping its NCQA credential. Securities counsel rarely tweak SEC filings unless there is a good reason to do so, so investors should take note of what is happening at Teladoc. We believe the disclosure changes portend potential behind the scenes reputational issues that Teladoc is currently facing - which could not come at a worse time given that the company's Aetna contract is currently up for rebid.For context, using the WayBack machine we discovered that as of the company's 10-K filing (filed Feb 2019), the company was supposed to have its NCQA credential re-upped by March 27, 2019. As of April 1, 2019, that date had shifted to April 14, 2019. The NCQA's current website now states the expiration has shifted back to April 29, 2019. Given that Teladoc first received its NCQA credential in June 2013, the unexplained assessment delays and changes to securities filings are obvious red flags. Given Teladoc has had this credential dating all the way back to June 2013, it is unusual that the company keeps getting short term extensions of two weeks rather than getting fully accredited.The former CFO's surreptitious departure last year may now be forgotten but is likely still haunting Teladoc. We mention his departure because it is highly relevant to the company's NCQA credential. Something the market seems to have missed is that SIRF claimed that between 20-30% of the division that reported to the Clinical Director resigned in protest at some point in late 2017. The Clinical Director role at Teladoc oversaw credentialing. In light of the unexplained 10-K language pull, investors, therefore, deserve to know whether the former CFO's prior workplace conduct has had any impact on the company's credentialing division. In case there is any uncertainty as to whether the individuals mentioned in the SIRF story touched on NCQA credentialing, we point investors to this document that makes it clear Teladoc NCQA certification fell within the division run by the manager referenced in both the SIRF story and the aforementioned document.See below our analysis for the number of mentions in NCQA in various key SEC filings.Source: We a search for the term NCQA in various TDOC filingsWe believe that many investors are not yet familiar with NCQA. NCQA is non-profit a body that vets healthcare plans and their adherence to certain vetting standards. Here is the description that Teladoc provided of the NCQA in its 2017 (prior year) 10-K:Don't take our word for the importance of NCQA to Teladoc. In its FY17 10K, the company viewed its NCQA certification as important enough that it listed it as one of the company's competitive advantages within the first few pages of the 10-K.Source: FY17 10-KOn numerous occasions, including in the instance below, the company also very proudly touted its status as the ""first telehealth company to achieve NCQA certification in any category"".Source: Teladoc HealthAfter years of touting NCQA and its standing with NCQA, Teladoc suddenly dropped all mentions of NCQA in its FY18 10-K filed February 2019. Nothing has materially changed in Teladoc's business in that time period. NCQA is a US-centric credential but Teladoc revenues from US sources remains over 80% as of FY18 so it is not as if the company's international expansion could possibly explain the shift in language.The decision to change language in a securities filing - after it had appeared for years - is significant. In our experience, companies tend to remove this type of language in anticipation of potential shareholder litigation. All claims that a company makes in its securities filings are subject to potential future shareholder litigation. With Teladoc already facing a class action suit pertaining to its handling of the former CFO's workplace conduct - conduct that we have already established touched the division handling NCQA issues - we are not surprised by the company's decision to more carefully position its securities filings.While Teladoc has not provided us with any color relating to its delayed NCQA credential, the company did address the issue with Credit Suisse according to a note from Credit Suisse dated March 20, 2019, in which Credit Suisse published the following;Source: Credit Suisse TDOC Note dated March 20, 2019Teladoc's international revenues are still only 18% (p17) of overall revenues per its latest 10K and were 8% in FY17 (p19). In other words, while international is growing quickly, the company still generated over 80% of revenues from the United States. The company's explanation that it is now global hence stopped ALL mentions of NCQA, therefore, does not make any sense to us.In light of the language changes around the NCQA, and the allegation from SIRF that there were significant late 2017 turnover problems in the division that touched credentialing, we believe investors should question Teladoc as to why the company abruptly changed its disclosures.Given the prolonged assessment relating to NCQA, and the history of issues with the company's division that touched credentialing, we decided to conduct our own analysis of Teladoc's doctor credentialing program. We found some glaring red flags.Dr. Monika Roots and her husband Kyle Roots together sold a company to Teladoc in 2016. Both of them went on to work at Teladoc, with Dr. Roots holding the title of VP of Health Services and Senior Medical Director of Behavior Health. Per her LinkedIn profile, Dr. Monika Roots left Teladoc in June 2018.We reviewed Dr. Roots' LinkedIn in which she claims to have left Teladoc in June 2018. However, as one can plainly see below, Dr. Monika Roots signed off as President of an entity directly tied to Teladoc (with a listed address of Teladoc's Lewisville, Texas office) as recently as March 6, 2019:Relevant Excerpts from MA FilingsSource: Teladoc Behavioral Health Massachusetts, P.C.Below we have provided an excerpt of our exchange with Teladoc regarding Dr. Roots.The following is an excerpt of a broader line of questioning that we sent to Teladoc in a request for comment:In response, Teladoc provided the following statement:We also sent a similar request for comment to Dr. Roots asking why her signature was on entities tied to Teladoc months after she left the company but received no reply.Teladoc claimed in their written response to us that the professional corporations for which Dr. Rots served as an office ""have been defunct prior to her departure"" and that they are in the process of dissolution.We plainly disagree. It can be plainly seen below - and we retrieved this information on April 6, 2019 - that the Teladoc Behavioral Health Massachusetts entity is still ACTIVE. When we went to the MA website as recently as 4/6/19, it is clear as rain that there is no filing of an Article of Voluntary Dissolution.Plus - if this entity was in fact dissolved, why did Dr. Roots sign off as the President of the entity in an effort to file a formal annual report on behalf of the entity as recently as 3/6/2019?Source: Go here then click ""View Filings""In response to Teladoc's comment, we specifically asked Teladoc IR the following:In response to that question, Teladoc IR provided the following statement:We could simply find no record of the entity being dissolved or defunct. We pressed Teladoc to provide us with evidence of their claim and Teladoc did not respond.This begs the question of why a former Teladoc employee / medical doctor who had a hand in credentialing activities per her own online admissions was still signing off on entities directly tied to the company almost nine months later.We have not been able to get a clear answer as to why this happened - but we think this is a clear sign of internal control problems at Teladoc. Why would a former employee who had departed so many months earlier still be showing up as signing off on Teladoc entities almost one year after her departure from the company?We reviewed Teladoc's terms of service and note that the Terms of Service (retrieved 4/8/2019) that made the following statement:Source: Teladoc TOS from an actual telemedicine visitWe note that no such entity under the name Teladoc Behavioral Health, P.A. actually exists in Massachusetts. The only entity tied to Teladoc with Behavioral in its name is the entity that we found tied to Dr. Monika Roots that has a slightly different name. See below:Source: OpenCorporatesWe have more questions than answers on this topic and Teladoc stopped replying to us for comment after an extended back and forth. Unfortunately, both we and the investing public have to figure out what is going on above on our own. We think it is a sign of significant internal control problems when a former employee - ~9 months removed - is still signing off on entities tied to her former employer. Given the changes to the company's 10-K, we find this fact pattern disturbing at best and think Teladoc needs to provide more color to the market on what is going on with this entity.After discovering the above inconsistency, we started scouring various healthcare databases to figure out where else Teladoc may have control issues. We noticed a phone number across all Teladoc entries in the NPI database. The phone number is: 214-302-5205.You can see the phone number listed for numerous Teladoc NPI entities below:Source: NPI RegistryAs a reminder, per CMS, The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Administrative Simplification Standard. The NPI is a unique identification number for covered health care providers. Covered health care providers and all health plans and health care clearinghouses must use the NPIs in the administrative and financial transactions adopted under HIPAA.We called the phone number. It reached the voicemail box of the former Clinical Director of Teladoc who, according to SIRF left the company in October 2017! The phone immediately rings out to a dead voicemail box. The same phone number above is listed in this dated presentation (p18) alongside the former Clinical Director's name.We're now sitting in April 2019 and this phone number still has not been updated.Sure, we expect bulls and defenders of the company to say that an incorrect phone number in a CMS database is no big deal. In isolation, we agree. In light of everything the disclosure changes we highlighted at the company, as well as the company's prior material weakness over internal control disclosures (see p34), we find the entire fact pattern highly troubling. But what is pretty clear here is that the company has likely not done a rigorous assessment of these entries dating back to at least October 2017 as evidenced by its failure to update the contact phone number to one that is current. We think this lack of reassessment is very pertinent in context of the NCQA language change.Using HHS's NPI directory, we received 25 hits for the search term ""Teladoc"". The NPI Registry is a free directory of all National Provider Records. In the case of Teladoc, because physicians cannot be members of publicly traded companies due to legal liability issues, Teladoc must contract with off balance sheet entities that actually provide the telemedicine services.Two of the 25 hits we recovered caught our attention, namely NPI #1629352182 and NPI #1033454780. In both of these records, Dr. Glenn Kerr is recorded as the ""Authorized Official"" on these NPI entries. Note the hyperlink tied to Glenn Kerr's name above specifically links to a Dr. Glenn Kerr who works on Teladoc and who is based in South Dakota. Using a background checking service we found only one instance of a ""Dr. Glenn Kerr"" in South Dakota.Source: NPPES NPI RegistryThis caught our attention because our background check into Dr. Glenn Kerr indicates that he passed away almost one month ago. Given Teladoc operates in a heavily regulated industry and is clearly facing some sort of delay relating to NCQA, we found it surprising that this issue appears to have slipped through the cracks. Again, this calls into question how tight Teladoc's internal controls really are. We confirmed on the NPI website that an authorized official from Teladoc needs to make tweaks to the registry entry. Why have no tweaks to this NPI entry been made?Some readers may say that it is no big deal that Dr. Glenn Kerr is still the authorized official on a Teladoc entity. Again, in isolation, this seems fine. But with the NPI database still listing a phone number tied to a former employee who departed ~18 months ago, and a former employee still signing off on Teladoc related documents 9 months after she left the company, we think this Dr. Kerr NPI entry should be viewed in context of a broader pattern of documents in disarray.We have been negative on Teladoc for months and our negativity only grows. Better Help, a company owned by Teladoc, had an individual indicted on rape charges on its platform long after his indictment. The therapist in question was found guilty in March 2019. We provided Teladoc with numerous opportunities to shoot down this claim and they have not provided any evidence to the contrary. Better Help also engaged in what we view as unsavory business practices in order to recruit vulnerable patients through the use of social media influencers. This was all profiled in our first story about Teladoc.The company covered up its former CFO's improper workplace conduct through a small employment agreement change, but was ultimately exposed through a SIRF story and parted ways with him. Even after parting ways with him, the company packed him off with 100% of his discretionary bonus (a fact revealed in this filing buried in the TDOC 10-K). Given what happened to the stock after his departure, and given the shareholder litigation the company is now facing, we are surprised that Teladoc's BOD found it appropriate to pack the former CFO off with his entire discretionary bonus.The company then mysteriously pulled all references to its NCQA credential at the same time that the NCQA continues to prolong the company's assessment period. The company's credentialing division just so happens to have been directly impacted by the former CFO's improper conduct.We have also found numerous examples of questionable doctor related filings on behalf of Teladoc entities - including paperwork signed by former employees long departed, an entity tied to a deceased doctor, and a phone number registered for CMS purposes that forwards to a dead voicemail box of an employee who left the company around October 2017. We think there are clear signs here of an organization in disarray. Teladoc is running on fumes and after its lackluster FY19 guidance and continued cash burn, we think the company could unravel in the near-term."
4229212,79675,2018-12-19T11:16:03-05:00,"Teladoc Health's stock is down big over the last three months.And the recent departure of Teladoc Health's Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer added fuel to the fire.However, I believe that TDOC shares are still worthy of investment dollars. I am long Teladoc Health and I plan to stay long.","Teladoc Health's (TDOC) stock has faced significant downward pressure as the broader market pulled back over the last few months but, more recently, the high-level personnel issue (i.e., the COO/CFO resignation) added fuel to the fire.TDOC data by YChartsThe stock has actually performed well so far in 2018, even after factoring the recent dip, so some shareholders may still be sitting on a nice gain for the year. So, the question is: does the personnel issue make the stock a sell? In short, no. However, I do believe that Mr. Mark Hirschhorn's, Chief Operating Officer (""COO"") and Chief Financial Officer (""CFO""), resignation adds risk to the story.It was only a few days ago that Teladoc refuted SIRF's, or Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation, report that Mr. Hirschhorn had a relationship with a former Teladoc employee. Even more damaging, SIRF reported that Mr. Hirschhorn and the former employee traded TDOC shares together (a topic that has not garnered much attention yet).While the company did admit to disciplining Mr. Hirschhorn for violating workplace policies, the thought that management turned a blind eye to these violations was refuted.On December 17, 2018, Teladoc announced that Mr. Hirschhorn resigned from the role of EVP, COO and CFO, effective January 1, 2019. The company already began the search to fill the COO and CFO roles, while internal candidates fill in on an interim basis, but let's not act like Mr. Hirschhorn will be an easy act to follow. Mr. Hirschhorn has played a significant role at Teladoc over the years and, from a financial standpoint, he is a major reason why the company is where it is today.I say all of this to say Teladoc will need to find some very capable people to fill in two positions that are mission critical, which is obviously not going to be an easy task. However, it is important to remember that the rest of the management team is still intact, including the well-respected CEO, Jason Gorevic. So, while the stock may see a great deal of volatility until the new COO and/or CFO prove themselves to the Street, I believe that Mr. Hirschhorn leaving the company is not a legitimate reason to sell the stock.In the same press release that disclosed Hirschhorn's resignation, management reaffirmed their Q4 and full year 2018 guidance:Source: Press ReleaseThere is a lot to like about the forward guidance, but, in my mind, there are two key metrics that stand out the most - that is, revenue and visits.Source: Data from press release (above) and Q4 2017 report; table created by authorYes, acquisitions are coming into play but what makes these figures even more impressive is the growth that was reported last year (revenue and visits grew by 89% and 54%, respectively, in fiscal 2017). Plus, as I recently described, Teladoc has a real market opportunity so the strong growth should continue for the foreseeable future.Source: William Blair 38th Annual Growth Stock Conference, June 2018It is hard denying the fact that the future for Teladoc Health appears to be bright. Moreover, the reaffirmed guidance tells a good story - that is, this company is firing on all cylinders and customers (and potential customers) are starting to see the value-added benefit of utilizing Teladoc's products/services.I would not get too caught up on valuation, as Teladoc is still early in its growth stage, but I believe that shares are definitely trading at more attractive levels now than they have been over the last two years.TDOC PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsOn a price-to-sales basis, TDOC shares are getting back to what I would consider more reasonable levels based on historical metrics. The stock is not ""cheap"" by any means but I also do not believe that the potential near-term growth is baked into the stock price either. The COO/CFO resignation is concerning but, again, the personnel issue is not a game-changer, at least in my mind.Investing in small-cap companies comes with many risks, but the major risk for Teladoc is related to the company being outspent by larger competitors. Additionally, the company relies heavily on its partnerships to expand its business so deteriorating relationships in the industry could have a material impact on Teladoc's business.In addition, integration risk needs to be considered given the numerous acquisitions that have been made over the last few years. And most importantly, regulatory changes have the potential to greatly impact Teladoc's business. Please also refer to Teladoc's 2017 10-K for additional risk factors that should be considered before investing in the company.Lastly, as described above, the COO/CFO departure definitely adds risk to the story.The COO/CFO departure comes at a tough time. From an operational standpoint, Teladoc has been firing on all cylinders and the market was starting to buy in on the company's long-term story. Filling in two key roles will create noise through early 2019 but, in my opinion, Teladoc is well-positioned to benefit from an improving backdrop. The Hirschhorn news adds risk to the story but it is not a reason to sell a company that has a strong bull case.In my mind, Teladoc will either grow into a significant disruptive company in the healthcare industry or it will get acquired by a larger player. Either way, it is a win-win situation for investors. TDOC shares will likely not shoot up in a straight line but, in my opinion, the risk is to the upside if you are in it for the long haul.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. These are only my personal opinions. Every investor must do his/her own due diligence before making any investment decision.Author's Note: I hold a small [but growing] Teladoc position in the R.I.P. portfolio.

TDOC shares are still up big over the last year (approximately 93%) but, in my opinion, the recent pullback is creating a buying opportunity for investors with a time horizon longer than 12-18 months. As I previously described here, Teladoc Health is shaking up an industry that absolutely needs disrupted. The company's suite of services are really starting to catch on and the recent acquisitions (Advance Medical, Best Doctors, etc.) are already bearing fruit. To this point, I believe that Teladoc has a significant market opportunity that continues to expand. Source: William Blair 38th Annual Growth Stock Conference, June 2018I believe that the current total addressable market (""TAM"") will turn out to be too low of an estimate in a few short years. Moreover, it is important to note that Teladoc Health has a wide competitive moat which, in my opinion, puts the company far ahead of its competitors. Source: Investor Meeting, Sept 2018Simply put, Teladoc has a clear path to prosperity and I believe that the company's first-mover advantage will pay dividends for years to come. It also helps the bull case that Teladoc's recent operating results tell a good story.On November 1, 2018, Teladoc reported Q3 2018 results that beat on the top- and bottom-line. The company reported a Q3 2018 net loss per share of $0.34 on revenue of $110.9M, which also compares favorably to the year-ago period. Source: Q3 2018 10-QThe highlights from the quarter: The growth that Teladoc experienced during the most recent quarter is something to brag about, as operating (and growth) metrics were up across the board. And if the most recent quarterly results were not good enough to win you over, it is important to note that management also provided strong Q4 and Full-year 2018 guidance. Q4 2018Full-Year 2018There is a lot to like about management's forward guidance and let us also remember that Teladoc is still in full growth mode so the EBITDA/net loss projections should not be viewed as negative developments, at least in my mind.The bears would have you believe that Teladoc acquired slow-growth assets (e.g., BetterHelp - see the last few articles on TDOC here for the bear story) for big money and that they are simply not working out, but I still view all of the recent acquisitions as key to management's long-term growth strategy. Management is heavily investing for the future, as they should be, and there are no signs of Teladoc slowing down anytime soon. This company already announced several game-changing partnerships, with a good example being the CVS deal, and management sounded extremely bullish during the conference call about the prospects of potentially servicing Medicare plans in the future: The future for Teladoc Health appears to be bright and the Q3 2018 results tell a good story - that is, this company is firing on all cylinders and customers (and potential customers) are starting to see the value-added benefit of utilizing Teladoc's products/services.

More specifically, it called out enhancements to the company's platform in addition to building out Teladoc's infrastructure to prepare for the expected growth in users and capabilities. Makes sense, right?Management was defensive when asked about the adjusted EBITDA guidance (the Street was looking for $42M vs. the guidance range of $25-35M that was provided) during the conference call, but I believe that management's response was sufficient/reasonable - i.e., the market should not get worked up over the guidance because adjusted EBITDA is expected to double in 2019, and this is after factoring in the strategic investments mentioned above. I agree with management and, if you ask me, the other stuff (guidance for the growth metrics, etc.) should be the real focus.At the end of the day, management's 2019 guidance was nothing to write home about, but I still believe that the bull case for Teladoc remains strong.Teladoc's story is simple: the company is disrupting an industry that needs to be disrupted.

These aren't the only problematic metrics though. EBITDA, and its more troublesome derivative, adjusted EBITDA, can be even more damaging to an investor's search for quality stocks.Both of these companies highlight their adjusted EBITDA growth to investors and tie executive compensation to the metric. However, their economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, reveal growing losses. Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) and Integer Holdings (NYSE:ITGR) are in the Danger Zone.The problems with EBITDA stem from its starting point, accounting earnings, which fail to capture the true profitability of a firm. EBITDA then ignores the real cost of capital needed to maintain a business through its removal of depreciation and amortization.Even worse, the calculation of adjusted EBITDA is often left entirely up to management, i.e. the same people whose bonuses are tied to adjusted EBITDA targets. Wouldn't it be nice to pick and choose what gets included and excluded in your own performance measurement? We've outlined even more issues with adjusted EBITDA here.Teladoc, a virtual healthcare service provider, boasts impressive revenue growth and reported its first year of positive adjusted EBITDA in 2018. However, when we perform real diligence to get at the true profitability of the firm, we find the situation isn't as rosy as management would have investors believe.TDOC's adjusted EBITDA has grown from -$47 million in 2015 to $13 million in 2018. Economic earnings have fallen from -$72 million to -$186 million over the same time. See Figure 1.Figure 1: TDOC's Misleading Adjusted EBITDASources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Given the company's rapidly declining economic earnings, it should come as no surprise that TDOC would rather investors focus on adjusted EBITDA. In its 4Q18 press release, TDOC noted, ""We utilize Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of our performance,"" which highlights the importance management places on this metric.However, by placing heavy emphasis on such a flawed metric, management is (1) ignoring real costs of doing business when presenting its results and (2) giving investors an incomplete picture of the company's financials. Here are just a few of the items TDOC removes when calculating adjusted EBITDA:The adjustments above are even more alarming given that TDOC's business model relies heavily on leverage and acquisitions to grow revenue.At its investor day in September 2018, the company noted its revenue had grown 75% compounded annually since 2014. However, this growth rate included a caveat; acquisitions accounted for the majority of growth. TDOC's organic revenue had grown at a much slower 29% compounded annually over the same time. By removing acquisition and integration related costs when calculating adjusted EBITDA, management is excluding the costs it incurs to achieve its touted revenue growth rate.The discretion taken to remove real expenses when calculating adjusted EBITDA is bad enough by itself, but it's made worse when one considers (1) management's recognition of the failings of adjusted EBITDA, and (2) TDOC's executive compensation plan is tied to adjusted EBITDA targets.In its earnings press release, TDOC outlines the shortcomings of its adjusted EBITDA metric. Some of the limitations the company lists are:Why then, if adjusted EBITDA does not reflect significant costs of running its business, does TDOC still use it as the primary measure of performance? For the same reason that previous Danger Zone picks such as Snap (SNAP), SunOpta (STKL), and Installed Building Products (IBP) did: it's easily to manipulate, so the company can beat quarterly forecasts and executives can hit their bonus targets.In its most recent proxy statement, 20% and 10% of executives' cash bonuses were tied to adjusted EBITDA and fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA respectively. 50% of cash bonuses are tied to annual revenue. TDOC's compensation plan incentivizes management to grow revenue and allows them to exclude the costs of revenue growth. Rewarding executive's in a such a manner can have disastrous results, as we famously saw with previous Danger Zone pick Valeant Pharmaceuticals.Ultimately, using adjusted EBITDA allows the company to present itself as profitable and lets executives keep earning bonuses even as they destroy shareholder value.We believe that that the 22% increase in TDOC's stock price since the beginning of the year has been driven by noise traders fooled by the company's positive adjusted EBITDA. When we remove the accounting distortions and look at the expectations implied by the stock price, TDOC appears significantly overvalued.To justify its current price of $60/share, TDOC must achieve an 8% NOPAT margin (double the average of its peer group currently under coverage, compared to -15% in 2018) and grow revenue by 30% compounded annually for the next 13 years. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario. For reference, P&S Market Research, an industry research provider, estimates the entire telemedicine market will grow by 15% compounded annually over the next five years. In other words, TDOC must immediately and drastically improve margins and grow at double the industry rate for over a decade to justify its current share price.Even if TDOC can cut marketing and other costs enough to achieve an 8% NOPAT margin and grow NOPAT by 20% compounded annually (still above industry expectations) for the next decade, the stock is worth just $11/share today - an 82% downside. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.Integer Holdings, a medical device manufacturer, reports rising adjusted EBITDA and looks undervalued by traditional metrics. However, as with TDOC above, economic earnings tell a different storyIn 2018, ITGR's adjusted EBITDA grew by 11% year-over-year (YoY) while economic earnings fell from -$29 million to -$57 million, per Figure 2.Figure 2: ITGR's Adjusted EBITDA Rises While Economic Earnings FallSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.When calculating its adjusted EBITDA, ITGR removes many common items, such as stock-based compensation ($10 million in 2018 - 6% of GAAP net income) and acquisition and integration expenses (none in 2018, $11 million in 2017). In addition, the company removes some more unique items:When all these items are removed, ITGR reported 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $259 million. Meanwhile, economic earnings were -$57 million.Executives at ITGR have 75% of their annual performance based incentives tied to adjusted EBITDA and 25% tied to revenue. As with TDOC above, ITGR's management team is incentivized to grow revenue, and through the heavy use of adjusted EBITDA, can remove the costs of achieving or acquiring that revenue growth.Instead of incentivizing executives with a metric that is directly correlated with creating shareholder value, such as return on invested capital (ROIC), ITGR chooses to use metrics that predominantly mislead investors and enrich executives.ITGR has outperformed the market over the past two years (+50% vs. S&P +2%). However, because 2018 earnings were inflated due to $121 million in income from discontinued operations, and management reported growing adjusted EBITDA, those using flawed traditional valuation metrics would believe ITGR is still a value.At its current price of $86/share, ITGR has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.7, well below the overall Healthcare industry average of 38.6 and the S&P 500 average of 20.1. ITGR also has an enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio of 15.3, which is well below the market cap weighted average of 22.8 for the 99 Healthcare Equipment & Supplies firms under coverage. We've covered the shortcomings of EV/EBITDA here.ITGR may look cheap by traditional metrics, but when we analyze the cash flow expectations baked into the stock price, we see that ITGR is significantly overvalued.To justify its current price of $86/share, ITGR must maintain its 2018 NOPAT margin of 11% (highest in the company's history) and grow NOPAT by 10% compounded annually for the next 12 years. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario. Such a scenario implies ITGR can grow revenue by more than double consensus expectations (5% in both 2019 and 2020). Furthermore, since acquiring Lake Region Medical Holdings in late 2015, the company has grown NOPAT by just 5% compounded annually .Even if ITGR can maintain current NOPAT margins (11%) and grow NOPAT by 5% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth just $39/share today - a 55% downside. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.Many of our most successful Danger Zone picks use or have used adjusted EBITDA as a performance metric in executive compensation. See Figure 3.Figure 3: Successful Danger Zone Picks Relying on Adjusted EBITDASources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.These firms can report misleading adjusted EBITDA only for so long.

4217514,83086,2018-11-02T09:00:00-04:00,"The sellside should be ashamed for not asking Teladoc management why Dr. Al Dirschberger’s was still on BetterHelp 9 months after his indictment on rape allegations.Management provided little to no color on BetterHelp, skirting the sellside’s softball questions with vague and boilerplate answers; this is starting to feel like Trupanion did a few weeks ago.Management did not dispute our claims regarding BetterHelp’s top-line significance –if you own this stock, you better be VERY comfortable with BetterHelp’s business practices and churn.Management downplayed YouTube’s significance (claiming <5% of TTM leads) but did say social/search are the main source of leads – but we think YouTube issues spilled over to social.We think investors are insane to put 10x sales on a segment that we think loses ~60% of customers after ONE MONTH and that faces such significant reputational risk.","As a reminder, we put out a story yesterday on Teladoc (TDOC). This is the first time we are writing an immediate update after a report because management never replied to our request for comment on yesterday’s story but did address (to some degree) our report on yesterday’s call. This article serves as an addendum to provide management’s side of the story and to also hold the company accountable for its weak call. Teladoc 3Q18 results were uninspiring – management definition organic revenue growth decelerated q/q from 39% to 28%, organic member growth decelerated materially q/q (from 28% to 12%) and both US paid members and 4Q EBITDA appear to have been guided down. Deceleration in organic revenue should be doubly concerning to shareholders given how reliant Teladoc has become on BetterHelp, a controversial business segment that in our view should never fetch anywhere near 10x sales. Operating leverage also remains elusive, with the 4Q EBITDA guide down despite a modest revenue bump. Organic subscription access fee revenue - a figure usually disclosed - was conspicuously missing in the 3Q18 release.  In short, we don’t see anything terribly exciting about Teladoc’s 3Q print for the bulls, but do view management’s posturing regarding BetterHelp as a sign that something is wrong with the segment.Notably, management did not dispute how significant BetterHelp has become to the business – in fact, in his remarks, the CEO Jason Gorevic suggested that he has been clear about BetterHelp’s contribution profile in the past (“ we've been very transparent about it being a growth driver and a contributor to our increasing PMPM”). Management also provided no specific details on the unit economics of BetterHelp (i.e. churn, customer acquisition cost etc.), but merely pointed out that BetterHelp metrics have improved over time. Management indicated that tapping into the “influencer” marketing channel is also only a recent development. We therefore wonder whether the purported improvement in unit economics at BetterHelp was in part due to the push into influencers. We also wonder what the backlash in the influencer community means for BetterHelp if that apparently lucrative marketing channel is now under pressure.Despite downplaying YouTube as a source of leads, management did indicate that social and search are BetterHelp’s “two primary drivers”. We are not quite sure how materially different social is than YouTube given the YouTube scandal has found its way off YouTube and into other social media sites (i.e. Twitter). We also think management should have discussed how much of a contribution general influencer marketing is rather than delineating YouTube from other social. Given management’s claim around social, we also did a quick search of Twitter to figure out what social promotions looked like and found this post:Source: TwitterWe suggest readers do their own diligence on these Twitter promotions. Clicking this link will do a search on Twitter for posts tagged with @betterhelp. We recommend reviewing each post and coming to your own conclusion around BetterHelp’s social media ad program.There is one issue from the call that both management and we agree on – BetterHelp is a significant contributor to Teladoc revenue and revenue growth. As a result, if you own this stock, we suggest you start to push management to provide real disclosures around this segment. We think investors are crazy to put a 10x sales multiple on a segment that (from our analysis) loses ~60% of its customers after the first month. We view the 3Q18 call as a major red flag – management did NOT address each point in our report despite our careful and thorough analysis that raised specific issues. In fact, the only piece of the report that management tackled head on with a specific data point was our claim regarding YouTube. We view management’s unwillingness to address each and every point in our report from yesterday as a major source of concern for any Teladoc investor.We also think its offensive that management got away without discussing Dr. Al Dirschberger. One analyst did ask a question about vetting at BetterHelp, and rather than addressing the elephant in the room, Mr. Gorevic claimed that Teladoc’s vetting is in-line with state requirements.This boilerplate statement – that ignored the very obvious Dr. Al elephant in the room – reminded us of Trupanion’s posturing as a result of reporting relating to its rewards program. When the company first faced allegations of non-compliance with regulations, it vigorously denied claims. Weeks later, the company ceased the same program that it had defended only days earlier.With BetterHelp now representing an undisputed material source of revenue and growth at Teladoc, and with BetterHelp comprised of a direct-to-consumer business model that is very different than Teladoc’s core insurance facing telemedicine business, Teladoc management owes investors specific granularity as to the financial and regulatory condition of BetterHelp. With the recent PR noise regarding BetterHelp’s relationship with influencers and with Dr. Al Dirschberger, we think Teladoc management needs to go above and beyond to give investors comfort with the segment. Instead, we viewed yesterday’s call as a game of hide the ball in which we learned almost nothing new about BetterHelp and got vague and boilerplate answers. This should concern anyone invested in Teladoc. Nothing on the call changed our opinion – in fact, we are only further emboldened.We reiterate our conclusion from yesterday: that Teladoc is fundamentally ‘uninvestible’ until management actually provides real disclosures around BetterHelp."

The stock that was a bargain on a dip to $30 on the big merger last year isn't a bargain this time following the purchase of Advance Medical. At nearly $60, Teladoc trades in a completely different situation now, having rallied following the recent deal suggesting investors do the opposite as well.Image Source: Teladoc/Advance Medical merger presentation Last week, Teladoc announced the purchase of Advance Medical and the stock hasn't stopped rallying. Remember though, the acquired company only had revenues of $63 million in 2017 that grew at a meager 15% growth rate. Telco bought a hot sector, but a not so hot business.Teladoc paid approximately $352 million for Advance Medical. The deal includes a cash payment of $292 million and $60 million in stock or roughly 1.34 million shares with the deal closing on May 31.The virtual care provider got a reasonable deal for roughly $73 million in forecasted 2018 revenues. The deal value is roughly 5x sales estimates for 2018.The opportunity for global expansion and scale is the clear reason for the deal. Advance Medical offers the complex care and episodic care offerings globally that Teladoc previously didn't.As the virtual health provider highlights, the global health insurance market is worth in the trillions and expected to double in the next decade. This market growth will play out over time, but the really easy addressable market is in the US multinational employment outside the US. The new company can now provide a more complete virtual health solution for corporations with over 14 million employees outside the US on top of the 28 million in the US.Source: Teladoc/Advance Medical merger presentationWhile the deal has huge potential for global expansion and leadership in virtual health, the stock will eventually come back to reality. The new company will have roughly $428 million in annual revenue this year and big questions on why Advance Medical is only growing at 15% in a wide open market.With a diluted share count of around 70 million (6 million additional shares from convertible debt offering and the 1.3 million for the merger), the stock is now worth about $4 billion. A key metric to check the updated value of Teladoc is the forward PS ratio.The stock has gone from a bargain at below 5x forward sales to now around 7x updated 2019 sales estimates. All of the gains in the last year are mostly due to multiple expansion.TDOC data by YChartsThe biggest issue is going to be the weak financials of Advance Medical and the costs of running a global operation at scale before having revenues at scale. Advance Medical only generated about $2 million in adjusted EBITDA last year and 15% growth isn't going to provide a lot of boost to the bottom line in the short term.Teladoc had adjusted EBITDA of negative $12.5 million last year so even positive EBITDA from Advance Medical makes the deal accretive. The company though likely needs to invest to reach scale, so what appears accretive isn't really meaningful to an already weak bottom line.The big issue is that revenues will approach $600 million in 2019 and the market will quickly turn sour on a stock where meaningful EBITDA isn't achieved.The key investor takeaway is that Teladoc completed an appealing merger to create a global virtual health powerhouse. The stock rally on top of the gains from the start of the year that has seen Teladoc nearly double makes for a time to pause.The stock likely hits $60, but investors will quickly demand some better financials before rewarding Teladoc with a higher valuation."
4194942,79675,2018-08-05T02:21:12-04:00,Teladoc Health recently reported solid Q2 2018 operating results that were well-received by the market.This telehealth company has promising long-term business prospects and its backdrop seems to be improving by the day.I am long Teladoc Health and I plan to add to my position in the near future.,"Teladoc Health (TDOC) is shaking up an industry that needs disrupted. The company's telehealth platform and other related services are garnering a ton of buzz (and usage) in the healthcare industry and I believe that Teladoc is just getting started. The company's stock performance is telling the same story, as TDOC shares have outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the last year. TDOC data by YChartsI posted ""Teladoc Is Worth A Look"" in early April 2018 and shares have already ticked higher (shares were in the lower $40 range) but, in my opinion, investors with a long-term perspective should seriously consider continuing to accumulate TDOC shares even in the $60 range. On August 1, 2018, Teladoc reported Q2 2018 financial results that missed on the bottom-line but that beat the consensus top-line estimate. The company reported an adjusted Q2 2018 loss per share of $0.40 (missed by $0.03) on revenue of $94.56M (beat by $2.19M), which compares favorably to the results reported in the same period of the prior year. The following were the highlights from the quarter: Teladoc's Q2 2018 revenue was positively impacted by the Best Doctors ($26M) and Advance Medical ($6M) acquisitions but organic revenue growth for the quarter was still an impressive 39%. Management also updated their full-year 2018 guidance: Source: Q2 2018 Earnings PresentationSome pundits are concerned about Teladoc's expanding net loss but I believe that it is way too early in the company's growth story to start worrying about earnings. In my opinion, Teladoc's Q2 2018 results are just what the doctor ordered - i.e., supports the bull case (Teladoc has differentiated product/service offerings that are disrupting the healthcare industry and the company has the potential to scale its business) and shows that the company's platform (and supplemental services) is being well-received by healthcare participates. Teladoc is leading the charge in the virtual care delivery space and, in my opinion, the company has a real market opportunity. According to management, Teladoc now has a total addressable market of $57B with the recent acquisitions factored in. Source: William Blair 38th Annual Growth Stock Conference, June 2018Additionally, it helps the bull case if you consider the fact that Teladoc also has a strong balance sheet that can be used to fuel future growth. Source: Q2 2018 10-QObservations: Teladoc has already proven itself to be a major player in its industry and the company's utilization rates are accelerating so, in my opinion, the sky is the limit for this telehealth company (a little dramatic, I know). The company's potential secondary offering caused shares to pullback, but I still believe that Teladoc's stock is attractively valued. TDOC PS Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsOn a price-to-sales basis, shares are creeping higher than the historical average but let's not forget that the recent acquisitions have the potential to real catalysts for the stock. Investing in small-cap companies comes with many risks, but the major risk for Teladoc is related to the company being outspent by larger competitors. Additionally, the company relies heavily on its partnerships to expand its business so deteriorating relationships in the industry could have a material impact on Teladoc's business.Lastly, regulatory changes have the potential to greatly impact Teladoc's business. Please also refer to Teladoc's 2017 10-K for additional risk factors that should be considered before investing in the company.There is a lot to like about Teladoc Health and I believe that the stock still has a tremendous amount of room to run, especially if you are willing (and able) to hold onto shares for at least the next five years. The company has reported strong top-line growth, coupled with impressive growth metrics (e.g., visits, membership, accelerating utilization, etc.), so it appears that Teladoc's long-term business prospects are improving by the day. In my mind, Teladoc will either grow into a large disruptive company in the healthcare industry or it will get acquired by one of the big dogs. A win-win situation. TDOC shares will likely not shoot up in a straight line but, in my opinion, the risk is to the upside if you are in it for the long haul. With that being said, I believe that Teladoc deserves to be on most investor's watch lists because the company appears to have tremendous growth prospects for at least the next decade.Author's Note: I hold a small [but growing] Teladoc position in the R.I.P. portfolio. I have no plans to sell any of my TDOC shares in the near future.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. These are only my personal opinions. Every investor must do his/her own due diligence before making any investment decision."
4216391,83086,2018-11-01T11:00:00-04:00,"The Street is not aware of how significant TDOC mental health play BetterHelp has become to TDOC organic growth; we estimate it now represents 70% of organic subscription revenue growth.The Street is not following the recent YouTube/BetterHelp scandal which caused a massive defection of YouTubers who decided to stop promoting BetterHelp due to controversy around the unit's sales practices.We question BetterHelp’s vetting protocols – as of September 28, 2018, BetterHelp still offered appointments with a therapist who was indicted on rape allegations nine months earlier.Our industry and credit card analysis suggests ~60% of BetterHelp patients churn off within the first month – with its YouTube lead engine now compromised, we expect rapid revenue erosion.Teladoc owes investors and patients answers as to what the company is doing to curtail BetterHelp’s questionable sales practices – until this happens, the stock is, in our view, 'uninvestible'","Teladoc acquired BetterHelp in January 2015 in order to enter the mental health market. Since the acquisition, BetterHelp revenues have exploded from almost zero to a projected $60 million in FY18. Teladoc has provided investors with limited detail about BetterHelp. As a result, the Street does not realize how significant BetterHelp has become to Teladoc organic subscription revenue growth. Later in this report, we show that BetterHelp could be contributing as much as 70% of organic subscription revenue growth to Teladoc. Just a few weeks ago, BetterHelp found itself at the center of a major controversy regarding its economic arrangements with YouTube Influencers. Critics allege that BetterHelp has been profiting off individuals with mental health problems. Criticism of BetterHelp has revolved around its model of compensating YouTube influencers to push BetterHelp onto their followers. There has also been vocal criticism surrounding BetterHelp’s terms of services. We also found evidence that BetterHelp is not doing enough to vet its therapists – we found an example of BetterHelp offering appointments in September 2018 with an individual who was indicted on rape allegations nine months earlier. Hundreds of YouTube Influencers appear to be defecting from BetterHelp, ceasing their prior promotion of the service. As a result, we expect Teladoc revenues to materially suffer going forward. We also expect there will be significant regulatory and legal liability arising from the scandal that is just starting to develop. As a result, we believe Teladoc shares are ‘uninvestible’ until management addresses the BetterHelp situation head on.Teladoc is a publicly traded “telemedicine” company that claims to be a leader in the nascent space. In a healthcare system plagued with excessive billing, replacing provider office visits with virtual visits has emerged as a potential solution to high costs. Teladoc has also aggressively expanded beyond its core telemedicine business, significantly diluting shareholders since its IPO in order to cut deals in other quasi-telemedicine verticals. Growth investors therefore view Teladoc as a way to “play” the powerful “technology meets medicine” cost efficiency theme. Management at Teladoc is also promotional, making every effort to excuse Teladoc’s alarming cash burn rate as a feature of the company’s purported “software as a service” model. As a result, Teladoc sports a lofty valuation north of 10x revenues despite its long and consistent history of incinerating cash.We believe the Teladoc (TDOC) bull case is severely misguided. We hesitate to put a target price on a company that should beimproving patient lives but is instead allegedly engaging in questionable tactics through its controversial mental health segment known as BetterHelp. BetterHelp is a mental health play on telemedicine. The unit operates a direct-to-consumer model in which it offers “virtual” therapist services. BetterHelp claims to charge patients $65 per week for the right to message with, speak with (over the phone), and video chat with therapists. This article in The Atlantic has made the rounds through online communities such as Reddit, but has somehow been missed on Wall Street.In this article, we explain our view a) that TDOC investors need to immediately come to their senses regarding the materiality of BetterHelp, b) why the YouTube controversy is likely to be the beginning of major regulatory, legal, and financial woes for Teladoc, and c) that BetterHelp’s suspect business practices should be viewed as part of a mosaic of data points that suggest Teladoc’s corporate culture is encouraging excessive risk taking at the cost of patient outcomes.Given that BetterHelp appears to be the fastest growing segment at Teladoc, we are not sure why investors and the sell side are not focused on this segment. The segment is on track to represent ~15% of revenues by YE18, growing off a base almost zero when it was acquired only four years ago – begging the question of whether the incredible growth in the segment is coming at the expense of patient outcomes.Source: On 1Q16 call, TDOC claimed 100K monthly BetterHelp revs accelerated to 500k monthly by YE15 – we extrapolated results from those figures to estimate YE15 revenues at BetterHelp. The hyperlinked article claims management said 2017 revenues at BetterHelp were ~27M. And in 2Q18 call (3/4th way of through the transcript), management said revenues at BetterHelp would near 60M in FY18. (1) Purchase price excludes 15% revenue-tied earn-outLater in this report we show that we believe as much as ~80%+ of YouTube oriented leads may have evaporated at BetterHelp since the scandal – we do not see these as likely to return given the scandal revolves around questionable pay to play sales tactics and suspect reviews in the extremely sensitive area of mental health. Even conservatively assuming a 50% headwind to BetterHelp into next year, Teladoc is facing a ~700-800bps organic growth headwind (at least $30M of revenue at risk on a FY18 projected base of slightly over $400M). We think the fallout for Teladoc could be far worse, as we expect the company will be forced, in part as a result of the YouTube scandal, to either divest itself of BetterHelp or to invest significant sums into a tighter sales compliance infrastructure – hitting margins at the same time as BetterHelp top-line erodes. As we look out to Teladoc’s upcoming 3Q18 earnings call, we believe that management must dedicate a significant chunk of the earnings call to discussing the current controversies surrounding BetterHelp as well as its contribution to Teladoc top-line growth. If management does not address BetterHelp on the upcoming call in detail, we will read this as a major red flag. This is particularly true given that BetterHelp’s founder has already been forced to publicly address the brewing YouTube scandal while Teladoc has said nothing publicly.Prior to publishing this report, we reached out for comment to Teladoc IR and United Health’s investor relations department (United Health appears to have a college student program partnership with BetterHelp). Our emails are presented at the bottom of the story. We have not received a response, but will try to keep readers apprised of any updates.Teladoc paid a measly $4.5 million for BetterHelp in January 2015 (the purchase price also included a 15% revenue-based earn-out that we believe has expired based on language in the most recent TDOC 10-K – see F-17). BetterHelp generated negligible revenues when it was first acquired. Within ~4 years, management now forecasts that the segment is on track to generate almost $60 million of revenues (per the company’s 2Q18 conference call). Revenues in the segment were still growing at north of 100% year-over-year.Let’s put the deal in context for a moment. In January 2015, Teladoc paid only $4.5 million for an asset that generated almost no revenue at the time. Three to four years later, the same asset is on track to do almost $60 million in revenues while still growing at over 100% year-over-year. This deal should be a badge of honor for a company as acquisitive as Teladoc. One would naturally expect Teladoc management to tout such a home run deal as an example of their capital allocation prowess.So we wondered whether Teladoc would take a victory lap over BetterHelp in its recent September 2018 analyst day. We find it odd – and rather telling – that a thorough review for BetterHelp mentions in Teladoc’s 113 page deck shows only a few mentions of BetterHelp – none of which provide any color whatsoever on the segment’s growth trajectory or business model. Why would Teladoc not want to tout this home run deal as an example of its successful M&A strategy? Why did we have to assemble BetterHelp’s revenue trajectory by using breadcrumbs from conference calls when the company is arguably the crown jewel of the Teladoc franchise?Teladoc has been on the radar of short sellers ever since the company went public, as can be seen in this 2015 WSJ article that foreshadowed fundamental weakness in the company’s core business. In fact, Teladoc has been quite an enigma for short sellers, because numerous data points have surfaced since the company’s IPO that suggest the competitive dynamics in the telemedicine industry are materially intensifying – and causing a compression of lucrative so-called “per member per fee” (“PMPM”) subscription revenues. Despite these competitive headwinds and noise around the fall of PMPMs, Teladoc has continued to post incredible organic subscription revenue growth rates – perplexing Teladoc bears who have been calling for downward revisions to Teladoc revenues due to PMPM erosion ever since the IPO. One contributor on Seeking Alpha also recently flagged the KBA lawsuit against Teladoc relating to overbilling – the article is worth a read and is yet another piece of a broader mosaic that to us suggests TDOC is an aggressively managed business that may be engaging in extremely risky business practices. So far, the noise surrounding Teladoc has had little to no impact on the share price. As Teladoc has marched on, bears have retreated, with short interest down significantly over the past few weeks from the high-30s % of float to under 20% (we suspect some of the remaining short interest is also attributable to the company’s outstanding convertible debt).We believe that the simple reason Teladoc continues to put up such robust top-line growth is because the BetterHelp acquisition is a far larger contributor to growth than investors realize.Below, we lay out our financial analysis that decomposes the sources of organic subscription revenue growth at Teladoc with and without BetterHelp. As a reminder, subscription access fees represented 85% of TDOC revenues in FY17 ( p52) – in other words, this is the metric investors are most focused on. We also note that Teladoc management has acknowledged BetterHelp flows through subscription revenues, with the CFO indicating during the 2017 Analyst day that “behavioral health is a subscription based model”.Source: Our analysis – we believe that BetterHelp was an insignificant revenue contributor in FY16 as we showed above.As you can see in the table above, we believe that BetterHelp contributed ~70% of total organic subscription revenue growth at Teladoc in 1H18 (~22pts of the total organic subscription revenue growth rate of ~32.7%). Given that Teladoc trades on a revenue multiple basis – and hence investors focus on subscription revenue as the key metric for valuation – Teladoc has clearly morphed from being a telemedicine / PMPM growth story to being a BetterHelp growth story. Yet, the buyside and sellside do not appear to be focused on BetterHelp. The chart above also explains why bears have yet to see the fruits of competitive intensity in their short positions – BetterHelp has more than picked up the slack for sluggish PMPM trends. As we show in the next section, we believe that BetterHelp growth is about to implode, leaving Teladoc’s overall top-line quite vulnerable.When we first started researching BetterHelp, we kept coming across YouTube videos in which “influencers” talked about their own mental health problems and how they utilized BetterHelp in order to overcome their issues. Some of the videos – such as this one that BetterHelp promotes in its marketing materials – espouse the benefits of “online” therapy versus in-office visits. We can intuitively understand that millennials – who have moved so much of their personal lives online – may very well prefer online therapy to in-person therapy. However, as we reviewed numerous videos that espoused the purported benefits of BetterHelp, we repeatedly noticed that the “influencers” pushing BetterHelp also disclosed that they were in fact being compensated to promote BetterHelp…We were puzzled by this concept. Here we have what appears to be a medical service – a recommendation to speak with a therapist – that is being pushed not by a licensed professional, but instead by a YouTube influencer. Imagine if instead Pfizer began to use YouTube influencers to push drugs? Obviously that example is extreme and would almost certainly trigger FDA questions, but we think reason stands that medical advice is likely best provided by … medical professionals.At a high level, we also wonder about the ethical implications of this model. The American Psychological Association provides ethical guidelines for barter arrangements with patients. Based on our understanding, the wording of the standard implies that bartering is inherently unethical and should be avoided. BetterHelp effectively provides free therapy services to influencers. In exchange, BetterHelp also pays influencers anywhere from $100 to $200 for each new BetterHelp patient they generate. From our analysis, we believe that this economic relationship could be seen as a bartering arrangement with potential ethical implications – influencers are heavily incented to “enjoy” their bartered free therapy session given they can financially benefit by espousing the rewards of their free therapy to their followers.So we naturally wondered just how significant YouTube is as a source of leads for BetterHelp…to answer this question, we conducted a survey of 100 BetterHelp patients. Our results are below:Source: We commissioned a survey of 100 current and previous BetterHelp patientsOur survey work suggests that YouTube is the top source of referrals for BetterHelp. Furthermore, we note that friend referrals are likely composed of some of the other subcategories above. Therefore, based on our analysis, we believe YouTube is a material source of leads for BetterHelp.BetterHelp’s heavy reliance on YouTube is likely to be a significant headwind going forward. Perhaps unsurprisingly, BetterHelp’s questionable paid promotion arrangements with YouTube influencers have caught the ire of many. In fact – the pay to play dynamic backstopping the YouTube promotion campaign for BetterHelp actually became the subject of a video with over 4 million views on YouTube from one of the platform’s most well-known influencers – PewDiePie (for the non-initiated, PewDiePie is the highest earning YouTuber out there according to Forbes). This video is an absolute must watch for anyone underwriting Teladoc. PewDiePie is not the only YouTuber who has come out negatively on BetterHelp – see a smattering of quotes we compiled from YouTube below:Source: Our transcription of YouTube clipsWhile the mainstream media has sadly paid no attention to the BetterHelp/YouTube drama, it was a significant enough event that the founder of BetterHelp published an article a few weeks ago defending against allegations levied against BetterHelp.In the article, BetterHelp’s founder attempted to downplay the YouTube scandal, alluding to supposed “conspiracy” theories that were floating on the internet. Without providing any source for the claim, the founder alleged that some online commentators had claimed that “BetterHelp is operated by the mossad”.Whenever an executive resorts to downplay legitimate criticism by highlighting obviously absurd and ridiculous conspiracy theories that have no weight, we take notice.So we decided to audit some of Alon Matas’ claims. For example, in his Medium story, Mr. Matas claimed that BetterHelp engages in an extensive vetting process before signing up potential therapists. This process, Mr. Matas claims, results in only 15% of therapists being accepted onto the BetterHelp platform.We therefore wonder why Dr. Al Dirschberger was still listed on the platform as of September 28, 2018 – offering what appears to be a real patient appointment – despite the fact that he was indicted nine months EARLIER ( January 2018) on rape allegations.Source: YouTubeHis profile has now been pulled down but we (and others on YouTube and Twitter) were able to retrieve the profile a few weeks ago through this URL: https://www.betterhelp.com/al-dirschberger/.Source: Retrieved from Www.betterhelp.com/al-dirschberger in early October - website was subsequently pulled down without explanation following the YouTube scandalWe remind readers that Dr. Al Dirschberger has pled not guilty and vigorously disputes the allegations against him. However, we note that Niagara University immediately put in safeguards following the January 2018 incident and placed Al Dirschberger on administrative leave from his responsibilities with the Purple Eagles softball team. On the other hand, BetterHelp still appears to have had an active profile for him available for appointments 9 months after the indictment.We are even more concerned that BetterHelp is pushing its services on college students through United Health. We included United Health in our request for comment ahead of publication.Source: BetterHelpWe think it is noteworthy that the company changed its TOS response to YouTube criticism (Mr. Matas, BetterHelp’s founder confirmed this in his Medium article).So we decided to probe some of the company’s claims more vigorously. Through some internet digging, we found a “script” on Twitter that BetterHelp provides to YouTube influencers.On a personal level, we view it HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC that a company offering mental health services to vulnerable patients (including at risk college students) provides YouTube influencers with talking points and scripts on how to sell to those vulnerable patients.Source: TwitterWe also got our hands on documents provided to YouTube influencers describing not only what script BetterHelp recommends they read to their YouTube followers, but also what payments they offer to these influencers in exchange for referrals (see the footnote below). We noted one interesting point. In the script provided to YouTube influencers, BetterHelp encouraged them to remind followers that “BetterHelp has helped more than 600,000 people”. However, on BetterHelp’s website that we retrieved soon prior to publication, we note that that BetterHelp has a “counter” on its website that claims the company has helped around ~450,000 people. So which one is it? The script had to have been created prior to when we last visited BetterHelp.com, suggesting the company can’t get its numbers straight. Given BetterHelp is selling mental health services, we view even the slightest misstatement of fact or inconsistency of marketing message as a major red flag. Source: Script we found online provided from BetterHelp to influencers, www.betterhelp.comSpeaking of scripts – we found yet another red flag with respect to BetterHelp during our research. In our research, we came across Rob Spence – a freelance actor. In this video, he discussed how an anonymous group from Albania approached him through Fiverr to leave a fake review about BetterHelp:Source: YouTube (minute 23:50)The review was previously available on this website (we had to provide the Wayback version of it) – but it was taken down over the past few weeks. We were still able to capture a screenshot of the review below. The review was posted on BetterHelp’s official website until quite recently but was deleted after the YouTube scandal broke:Source: YouTubeBetterHelp’s own website boasts an unfathomable ~3,000 reviews that average 4.9 out of 5. In the rough and tumble world of internet reviews, it is hard to imagine that a company can generate almost a perfect review score. We therefore wonder if the review results are dependable.Source: GoogleWe also note that even the cost of BetterHelp to patients remains ambiguous when we compared cost claims on different parts of BetterHelp’s website. In its FAQ promotional materials, BetterHelp claims services cost as little as $35 per week. However, on the sign-up page, it is clear that services run for $65 per month. Even if it is the case that later months are cheaper, we still found it very odd and disturbing that BetterHelp does not maintain one consistent message with respect to its pricing:Source: BetterHelp website and sign-up pageNotably, in his defense article, Mr. Matas also claimed that over the week during which the YouTube scandal erupted, “[BetterHelp] has had a record number of sign-ups”. We’re not sure how Mr. Matas felt comfortable issuing what appears to be guidance relating to BetterHelp revenues…but we naturally wondered whether the YouTube scandal was really a “positive” for BetterHelp. So we did a simple analysis – we ran a web scrape of YouTube and looked for YouTube influencers who had previously promoted BetterHelp prior to the big YouTube scandal (we tried to gather as many YouTubers who had previously promoted BetterHelp as possible, arriving at a 317 historical population of influencers). Most YouTubers (theoretically it should be all because of regulations) who promote Betterhelp include a “promo link” in their YouTube video description – i.e. “Betterhelp.com/defranco”. We scraped (and continue to scrape) YouTube repeatedly to determine if the YouTubers are still including that link. The list we generated included hundreds of YouTubers who had – prior to the YouTube scandal – promoted BetterHelp. Under our analysis, we found that following the YouTube scandal, only 59 of these 317 prior evangelists still mentioned BetterHelp in their videos. In other words, based on our analysis, over 80% of prior BetterHelp YouTube evangelists appear to have ceased promoting the company on YouTube. What is even worse is that the YouTubers with the highest page views – i.e. Shane Dawson, Amy Lee, H3H3 etc. – appear to have stopped mentioning BetterHelp. This should come as no surprise – if you go to Twitter, you will see a vocal group has emerged challenging YouTubers who previously promoted BetterHelp.Source: Our analysis of YouTubeWe also note that the revenue earn-out to BetterHelp’s founder appears to have expired based on the three year payout after January 2015 ( p65 – “ In January 2015, we completed the acquisition of BetterHelp, a provider of direct-to-consumer, behavioral health services for $3.5 million in cash and a $1.0 million promissory note and we have agreed to make annual payments to the sellers equal to 15% of the total net revenue generated by the BetterHelp business for each of the next three years”). In other words, Mr. Matas likely has lost significant economic incentive to continue pushing BetterHelp revenue growth. Will he still be as motivated to push growth at BetterHelp when his significant economic incentive ceases at the end of this year?In our view, the combination of the YouTube scandal, the apparent dramatic fall-off in YouTube influencer promotion of BetterHelp, and the expiration of the BetterHelp revenue earn-out should leave investors concerned about the fundamental trajectory for Teladoc going forward – particularly given that BetterHelp has, according to our analysis, generated ~70% of the top-line organic subscription revenue growth at Teladoc in 1H18.It also does not help that BetterHelp appears to operate with an extremely high level of churn. We spoke with individuals involved in the industry who indicated that the virtual mental health / coaching industry is challenging and faces extremely high churn. As you can imagine, many people try out virtual services then decide it is not for them. From the payout schemes we reviewed (including the one we included above), we also believe that BetterHelp incents its lead generators (i.e. YouTubers) to generate as many leads as possible – with its payout tied to a closed application rather than being tied to how long the referred patient stays on the BetterHelp platform. BetterHelp pays its YouTubers anywhere from $100 (from the Twitter payout scheme linked earlier) to $200 for each closed referral and collects $260 ($65 weekly) for the first month from its patients. After paying therapists for their time, we imagine BetterHelp unit economics in the first month are therefore likely quite anemic. To better understand churn dynamics at BetterHelp, we purchased credit card data for BetterHelp cohorts to triangulate on what we were hearing from industry sources. For readers less familiar with this process, certain companies actually gather and compile credit card transaction data and resell the data to investment firms. Terms of service agreements for some credit cards allow the card companies to resell user transaction data (hence why it is important to review TOS agreements for readers concerned about their privacy). The data is generally anonymized and does not provide any specific personal identifying information related to transactions, but does allow the analytics firm – and in this case, us – to better understand and extrapolate on trends from data. Whenever working with third party credit card data providers, one has to understand that the data may have reliability issues and should only be used for directional purposes. We got some comfort with the credit card data because we also did industry checks that suggested the virtual mental health space has high churn. Our analysis of the credit card data we reviewed is provided below:Source: Our analysis of credit card data we acquiredWe note that the credit card data we received suggests that the vast majority of BetterHelp patients churn off the platform within a few months. In fact, our data set suggests that almost~60% of patients churn off the platform after one month of usage.In case bulls try to argue that high churn suggests people’s problems are “being fixed” we counter with this point. According to research conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, therapists who practice more traditional psychotherapy treat patients for an average of 22 sessions before concluding that progress isn’t being made. Assuming patients visit therapists even twice weekly - which seems aggressive – patients under this study would have spent 11 weeks in therapy on average.What we gather from our analysis and conversations with industry participants is that BetterHelp needs to keep its lead generation engine humming in order to offset its high churn business model. In light of the collapse in YouTube influencer interest in BetterHelp (which we outline above), and our view that we are in the early stages of the PR storm surrounding BetterHelp’s business activities, we expect BetterHelp revenues could very quickly fall off a cliff. As we pointed out earlier, with YouTube sign-ups likely to fall off a cliff, it is easy for us to envision 50%+ declines in BetterHelp revenues, meaning 700-800bps of organic headwinds for Teladoc going forward.When a business runs from $100,000 of monthly revenue in 2015 to over $60 million of annual revenue in 2018, and the business is a high churn model that relies on aggressive referral programs that now appear to be going the wrong way, one has to naturally ask the question of whether the revenues are sustainable. We remind readers that we believe ~70% of organic top-line subscription revenue growth at Teladoc comes from BetterHelp. If the BetterHelp growth engine is in fact faltering as we suspect, it stands to reason that Teladoc’s revenue growth rate is likely to re-rate meaningfully lower in coming months.We are therefore alarmed by the pace of insider selling at Teladoc. Red denotes insider selling. Green denotes buying. The red is all over the chart below:Source: BloombergGiven Teladoc management has been actively selling stock over the past few months – including what appears to be accelerating insider selling immediately prior to the YouTube scandal – we think management owes its shareholders a long and specific explanation for what has been happening at BetterHelp, how much of a contributor BetterHelp has been to revenues, and also an explanation for any potential downward revisions to Teladoc revenues or earnings as a result of the BetterHelp PR fiasco. The time for transparency is now – while Teladoc has thus far managed to keep the BetterHelp fiasco from moving beyond YouTube and into the mainstream, we do not believe that trend will not continue forever. Dr. Al Dirschberger’s presence on BetterHelp nine months after an indictment is an obvious red flag. We have other concerns with Teladoc’s management that go beyond Mr. Matas. Given our concerns around some of the fast and loose numbers we found at BetterHelp, we looked into the TDOC’s CFO background. Teladoc shareholders should review this litigation which includes certain allegations with respect to TDOC’s CFO Mark Hirschorn. Given the information laid out in this report, we encourage readers to draw their own conclusions on whether Teladoc is a suitable investment. We are drawing attention to this shareholder litigation pertaining to Mark Hirschorn because the allegations in that lawsuit relate to an alleged phantom invoicing scheme. Hirschorn was CFO at the company referenced in the shareholder litigation as well. We think the allegations in the lawsuit are potentially relevant to investors given that we have called into question numbers that Teladoc is presenting through its BetterHelp segment in this report.On the topic of personnel at Teladoc, in light of our prior finding of potential vetting issues at BetterHelp, we also suggest readers start immediately researching the circumstance surrounding the departure of Teladoc’s Chief Medical Officer in September 2017. According to Teladoc’s own website, its Chief Medical Officer is (was?) Dr. Henry DePhillips, who the company claims is “supervision and expansion of Teladoc’s physician network”. We are not sure why his profile is still active on Teladoc’s website given that according to his Linkedin profile, he left Teladoc position in 2017. It also appears in other web searches that Teladoc brought a new Chief Medical Officer on board after DePhillips. Notably, Dr. DePhillips now claims to be the Chief Medical Officer of a company that is run by the current Teladoc Chairman (David Snow). Given there appears to be no 8-K surrounding his departure, and given his pivotal role as the individual previously responsible for vetting doctors, we believe his departure should be seen as a potential red flag and worthy of additional diligence.In summary – we think Teladoc has a huge problem on its hands with BetterHelp. Until management addresses this report, we view the shares as ‘uninvestible’. The mystery of sustained “organic growth” at Teladoc in the face of intense PMPM pressure now makes much more sense in context of BetterHelp – but, with the mystery unraveled, Teladoc’s chances of continuing to post robust organic growth rates also appears bleak. While we are short Teladoc shares and expect material downside, we think this article is most relevant to existing shareholders who should carefully determine whether they are appropriately pricing and valuing BetterHelp risk and top-line growth risk.Author’s note: We gave Teladoc the questions below ahead of publication. We also asked United Health about its relationship with BetterHelp (see below). We gave both groups over 24 hours to reply. If they reply, we will amend the article and add their replies below."

The concept still faces a lot of prejudice. People refer to it as the “uberization” and dehumanization of health, unlikely to provide the same quality as traditional care. In fact, telemedicine is a new way to bring patients and caregivers together in a highly organized network with good traceability.It’s an under penetrated and growing market. According to Statista, telemedicine is expected to grow to more than $40 billion until 2021, close to 15% CAGR.Telemedecine is a fundamental trend for health care: The same way e-commerce, entertainment, transportation, payments, social networks or gaming have turned to mobile with the rise of the app economy. When you don't need emergency help, but you do need to see someone, remote access to health professionals saves you a trip to the doctor and provides instant feedback from the comfort of your home.That trend appears inexorable in the 21st Century as broadband improves across the world and demand from tech-savvy millennials and Gen Z increases. We are still in the early innings of this transformation.Source: Global telemedicine market size (Statista)Here is a refresher on Teladoc (TDOC)’s business in five key points:Images Source: Teladoc websiteTeladoc is making money through three business models:35% of Teladoc’s float is short according to Yahoo Finance. The breakdown of the above business models is very important here because the short thesis against Teladoc is mainly that the SaaS business model around the PMPM fees justifies its high valuation and could be replaced over time by the lower margin visit-fee revenues.However, as broken down by the form 10-Q, PMPM-fee is stable at 84% of total revenue in both the first half of 2017 and 2018.Better yet, the utilization rates are improving, making the subscription model even more likely to persist. COO, CFO and EVP Mark Hirschhorn provided more color on the utilization rate, a meaningful KPI that illustrates the story of telehealth and its growing subscription adoption:Source: Form 10-QTeladoc completed three strategic acquisitions in the last two years, all accretive to its top and bottom line:All these acquisitions were in the range of five times yearly sales.Teladoc is building a full-service offering, a comprehensive solution to multinationals looking for a global solution to employee healthcare. The company was able to opportunistically expand its services and international footprint.2018 might be a turning point, with Teladoc becoming more than the sum of its parts following the integration of its multiple acquisitions.As explained by CEO Jason Gorevic during Q2 earnings call:The organic growth is still impressive for a company founded 16 years ago. As detailed by Mark Hirschhorn during the last earnings call:The overall integration of these companies appears to be smooth given the high ratings maintained by the CEO on Glassdoor.Image Source: GlassdoorImage Source: Getty ImagesAs recently discussed on CNBC, Teladoc added a significant new partnership with CVS (CVS) in August 2018:CNBC’s Angelica LaVito explains that the rollout across the United States comes after four years of experimentation. CVS first tested telehealth with pilots in California and Texas in 2014. It started tests with Teladoc, American Well and Doctor on Demand the following year, as part of the dynamic forcing retailers to innovate. She adds:Source: Form 10-QAdjusted EBITDA has turned positive in the first half of 2018 and should improve in the coming quarters with the full integration of Advance Medical.Turning to the balance sheet, the CFO broke down the most recent cash and debt position during the Q2 earnings call:“ we ended the quarter with approximately $132 million in cash and short-term investment. Our cash balance today, after giving effect to last week’s offering is approximately $450 million. Our total debt, as of the end of the quarter was $562.5 million, which consist of our two convertible note issuances. The $275 million 3% convertible notes that mature at the end of 2022 and the $287.5 million 1.375 notes that mature in 2025. Our GAAP presentation of this debt appears as approximately $400 million as it is net of the equity component of the securities in our consolidated financial statements.”The company has used $37 million in operating cash flow over the last 12 months. That number should get better in the coming year thanks to the recent acquisitions and improving EBITDA.The main concerns for Teladoc include:Teladoc’s valuation is what you would expect from a market leader growing fast organically in an under-penetrated, rapidly-growing market.With a market capitalization around 13 times FY18 projected sales, the company is valued at a high premium, particularly compared to Teladoc’s recent three acquisitions all valued at about five times trailing sales.Now, back when Teladoc filed for IPO in 2015, its market capitalization already was about 15 times its 2015 yearly sales run rate. Investors who have refused to pay a premium for a best-in-class company since the IPO have missed on more than 500% gain over the last three years.If you are interested in Teladoc as a healthcare play in the rise of the app economy, a buy and hold approach for at least the next five years is, in our opinion, the way to go.It comes at a premium today, but we believe shareholders will be healthily rewarded as long as they are willing to see how the story plays out through ups and downs.Before you buy any share of Teladoc, you should recognize that profitability is still a long way to go on a GAAP basis and that the company is exposed to regulatory risks and industry disruption from other players.Teladoc is valued richly, as a 21st century SaaS business leading in a disruptive and under-penetrated industry should be.At App Economy Insights, we want to hold companies for five to 10 years to see how the story unfolds. That’s why we care more about the leadership and disruptive nature of a company rather than its price action over the next few months. If you want to wait for Teladoc to be “fairly valued” according to an arbitrary specific price before buying any shares, you might never take any position. We believe Teladoc offers a great growth story at the corner of Healthcare and Technology for investors with a decade-long view.Choosing an individual stock can be easy, but the success of an investment strategy comes down to the investor’s execution and behavior.

It plans to cross-sell those capabilities to U.S. multinationals looking for a robust offering for workforce healthcare options worldwide.The Westwood, Massachusetts-based company was founded in 1999 to provide patients with expert medical opinions and support on demand in several countries.Management is headed by co-founders and co-CEOs Marc Subirats and Carlos Nueno. Prior to co-founding Advance Medical, Subirats was a graduate of the MBA program of the IESE Business School at the University of Navarra in Barcelona, Spain.Below is an overview video of Advance Medical’s services:(Source: Advance Medical)Advance Medical’s primary offerings include:The company has partnered with more than 300 large, multinational employers and insurers across Europe, Asia, Latin America and the U.S. and ""covers over 25 million patients globally"" by providing them with access to informed medical opinions on a case-by-case basis.Investors have invested at least $26 million in the company and include Summit Partners, Venrock, Aberdare Ventures and Arboretum Ventures.According to a market research report by Transparency Market Research, the telehealth market was valued at $6 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13% between 2017 and 2025.The main driver for this expected growth is the increase in adoption of remote monitoring solutions by patients in remote rural areas.Major competitive vendors that provide telehealth services include:Teladoc disclosed the acquisition price and terms as $292 million in cash and 1.344 million shares ($60 million) of TDOC common stock.Advance Medical posted 2017 revenues of $63 million, so TDOC paid a 5.6x multiple of prior year’s revenues.TDOC did not change its financial guidance but said it would ""provide an updated full-year 2018 financial outlook and guidance for the combined company after completing valuation and related purchase accounting considerations regarding Advance Medical.""As of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing, it had cash & equivalents and short-term investments of $1.2 billion and total liabilities of $266.7 million, so it appears to have had ample resources to close the deal without undue financial hardship.Teladoc acquired Advance for its international footprint and lack of significant overlap with Teladoc’s existing market areas.Additionally, Advance has a medication management service which Teladoc expects to use to ""help meet demand in the U.S. for clinical risk assessment services associated with [a] government program.""As Teladoc stated in the deal announcement:So, the company believes that the acquisition will help position itself to compete more effectively for large multinational virtual health business opportunities.TDOC stock price has risen 6.5% in the wake of the announcement, as the chart below indicates:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Investors appear to have reacted quite favorably to the news. Teladoc has paid a reasonable multiple for EBITDA-positive Advance Medical.Additionally, the deal provides Teladoc with a launching pad for further international expansion, though probably more through being able to win new business with U.S. multinationals looking for virtual health services for their overseas workforces.Teladoc CEO Jason Gorevick also highlighted in the transaction conference call that the deal will bring to the firm a set of solutions across the full spectrum of care, ""from important critical care cases all the way through high-frequency episodic care needs around the world.""This strategic acquisition looks to be a potential big win for Teladoc if its new full-service offering appeals to multinationals in the U.S.We will likely start to see results within the next 3-4 quarters as integration occurs and sales teams begin to roll out the new capabilities to clients and prospects."
4202818,58361,2018-08-29T10:34:51-04:00,"Lawsuit alleges overbilling.Lawsuit states that ""Teladoc expressed to KBA that it was having difficulty structuring a refund of the full Overcharges because of the potential negative impact on Teladoc's financial statements.""Customer states that it ""cannot be a party to reconstructing Teladoc's financial events.""","Key Benefit Administrators (KBA) filed suit against Teladoc (TDOC) on July 6th alleging overbilling and harmful behavior by TDOC and is seeking an injunction to require TDOC to continue to service approximately 10,000 KBA customers until a suitable replacement can be found. Customer lawsuits are not uncommon in the business world. However, this suit also has some allegations of overcharging (possibly admitted to by TDOC) and TDOC seeking to remedy the overcharging in ways that would not cause them to have to restate financials. This is obviously an issue, if true. KBA claims TDOC approached them in January of this year admitting overcharging $450,000. That would mean TDOC knew about the issue before the 10-K was filed and well before they raised capital in the public markets to finance their latest acquisition (the second convertible debt offering, completed this May totaling $250MM). The company raised additional $330MM of equity after the lawsuit was filed and made no specific mention of the suit in the prospectus supplement or 10-Q. Management clearly believes this suit is not material, and we would agree as long as this is an isolated incident.Here is the link to the complaint filed by KBA.We will just hit the highlights and let you decide how much of an issue it is.KBA signed up with HealthiestYou, a Teladoc acquisition from 2016, in October of 2016. For anyone new to the story, HealthiestYou is a company focused on the small-medium business vs. the traditional TDOC business focused on Insurers and large enterprises. HY also tends to mostly sell higher monthly fee plans that are unlimited use. KBA alleges that, in 2017, TDOC attempted to renegotiate the terms of their contract several times. KBA initially rejected the proposal, but eventually verbally agreed to a revised proposal and operated under that proposal while negotiating a new contract. KBA then alleges that on or about January 26, 2018, TDOC notified them they had overcharged KBA by $450,000. The overcharge, according to the complaint, was due to TDOC billing at a 40% utilization rate when the rate was actually 4%. TDOC then attempts to resolve the issue by offering future credits:Then, things apparently changed, and TDOC asserted the KBA actually owed them money:Then, a not-so-subtle accounting swipe:Then, strangely, after TDOC had reversed and claimed KBA owed them $750,000, they were reducing the original $450,000 overcharge to $350,000:After this back and forth, KBA finally notified TDOC that it would be moving 50,000 of its members to a different provider, leaving 10,000 with TDOC for the time being. TDOC countered with lower pricing, KBA refused, then TDOC terminated the other 10,000 subscribers with six hours' notice. KBA then alleges TDOC went around KBA and tried to sign those customers up directly. Some pretty bad behavior on TDOC’s part, if true.What does all this mean? That isn’t completely clear. In a best case, this is a one-off issue, and TDOC just lost 60,000 members that likely carried well above average monthly fees. The worst case could be fairly bad. This could be an issue across a group of customers and could be material to the TDOC financial statements which would need to be restated. There could also be a significant amount of refunds due to customers. At the very least, our research indicates that it will cause more than a few HealthiestYou and TDOC customers to audit their charges to make sure there isn’t a similar issue. It definitely adds to the risk profile of an unprofitable company trading at roughly 13x revenue and is worth keeping an eye on.PS: We plan to follow the court proceedings and may follow up with additional articles."
4152836,22148,2018-03-02T14:17:27-05:00,Teladoc saw a big boost in virtual visits from the flu epidemic in the U.S.The company has significant opportunities to grow the total addressable market including higher utilization rates.The stock is reasonable priced at 5x forward sales estimates.,"While numerous biotechs work to find the next vaccine for the flu epidemic that wreaked havoc on the U.S. this Winter, Teladoc (TDOC) offers a digital solution that helps prevent the spread of the illness and allow patients to easily get the needed medical care. The stock isn't cheap, but the best play in telehealth is a proven company now. The company has an attractive subscription model and a developing model that charges per visit. The subscription model generates revenue per user, per month. Other healthcare providers are going for paying fees per visit. Either way, Teladoc has an attractive model of recurring revenues with tons of room for expansion. The company is growing the subscription revenue per user having reached $0.95 per month, up from only $0.59 last Q4. Utilization rates ended Q4 at only 8.1% leaving plenty of room to bring in new patients from existing customers. The flu season caused a spike in January visits to 8,000 a day with 20% of visitors due to flu related symptoms. The ability to handle the spike in customers proves out the scalability of the platform and helped reduce patients from going to over loaded doctor's offices and exposing other people to the flu. Due in part to the new business Blue Cross Blue Shield over 50% of visits are related to new customers. The key to the virtual health business is to get customers acquainted to new technologies before mass adoption can occur. Teladoc made a ton of progress on that front over the last few months due in part to offering a better solution than doctor visits for the flu epidemic.With the inclusion of Best Doctors now, the virtual health concept goes far beyond the convenience to the patient and reduction in infected patients exposing other people in the process of visiting the doctor. Teladoc allows for rural patients to have quicker access to doctors, especially specialists. As well, patients in urban settings can access an expert in another state versus visiting whatever the local market offers. As well, behavioral health benefits from where doctors don't need to physically interact with the patient setting up a perfect growth opportunity. And possibly the best option for a virtual visit is a second opinion on a serious medical condition where Teladoc can immediately link up the patient with an expert in the related field. Grand View Research predicts fast growth in the U.S. telehealth market over the next five years led by an increase in services revenues and less focus on hardware solutions. My investment thesis remains intact so that those buying last year in the low $30s are sitting pretty here. The growth initiatives are playing out as expected and more and more health organizations are moving towards telehealth to provide better options for members and ultimately save money. The Best Doctors integration is going well creating the best of breed solution in the category to grab more customers this year. TRICARE will onboard another 9 million members on April 1 setting up a year of solid growth. Teladoc guided towards $355 million in '18 revenues with the following key metrics:Source: Teladoc presentation The reason to own the stock is that member utilization rates were down at only 6% for all last year. Teladoc has the potential to grow the member base and substantially expand the utilization rate leading analysts to a '19 revenue target of $450 million. TDOC Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsThe company isn't targeting positive cash flows until 2020 so investors don't want to get overly aggressive chasing the stock at record highs. Teladoc trades at about 5x forward revenue estimates so trading here blow $40 is the maximum to pay in order to ensure a solid return over the next year. The key investor takeaway is that Teladoc is an innovative leader in the fast growing telehealth sector. The company is busy acquiring members so the focal point is growth and not cash flows at this point. The flu epidemic helped prove out the business case setting up Teladoc to robust growth in the next year. The stock is a solid buy below $40."
4155873,104255,2018-03-13T09:46:18-04:00,Who is Teladoc and what do they do?The company is producing good earnings reports.Analysts continue to make positive comments.,"We have discovered Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) and like the company's future prospects. It meets our criteria of a growing business inside of a growing sector. We are always looking for stocks that might provide solid earnings growth and momentum.Teladoc is the country's largest provider of doctor visits via telephone or video conference. The company has a telehealth platform that offers healthcare via mobile devices, the internet, and phones. It helps diagnose patients for any non-emergency medical issue. Their virtual medical consultations offer patients the convenience of staying at home compared to the normal scheduling, commuting, and waiting process. The wait times to talk to a doctor may only take five to 10 minutes.Teladoc obtains revenue by charging insurers and employers subscription access fees or by charging patients per-visit fees. By video conferencing with a doctor, patients can get a medical checkup with a trained professional from their home. This saves on medical office costs and fees.Source: Seeking Alpha.Teladoc first went public with an IPO in June 2015. In the last year, it has risen over 100%. The company just released earnings results for the fourth quarter, showing total revenue of $77.1 million for the quarter -- an increase of 106% compared to a year ago. Total paid membership came in at 23.2 million, a growth of 33%. However, Q4 EPS showed a loss of $0.76 a share, missing guidance by $0.25. Teladoc continues to grow revenues and memberships, but as a growing company currently loses money as it spends on growing out its business. The CEO of the company seemed pleased with the latest results:Teladoc has agreements with many health plan issuers. The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan are among them for 2018. On March 2, the company announced an expanded collaboration with Microsoft (MSFT). They will be working together on advancing the delivery of telehealth. Teladoc's platform will be running on Microsoft's Azure cloud. The goal is to give hospitals and health systems across the country greater access to the virtual care solution. Teladoc is having a great year, growing its services into hospitals and health systems. Their product has now made its way into over 250 hospitals and health systems nationwide.Teladoc received positive analyst commentary recently from Deutsche Bank. Deutsche's analyst raised their price target to $45 from $39 after Teladoc's Q4 earnings release. He maintains his buy rating on the shares. The analyst expects growth to continue as the company benefits from its recent Best Doctors purchase. Sales should continue growing as Teladoc increases its marketing strategy and platform utilization.After the company's Q4 earnings release, Canaccord's analyst reiterated his buy rating while raising his price target to $45 from $43. He cited Teladoc's strong competitive position in a growing market, its upbeat earnings commentary, and possible guidance upside in 2018. The analyst at Cowen also cited potential upside to 2018 guidance. He maintained his Outperform rating while raising his price target to $43 from $39.As a growing company still trying to build itself out and achieve greater scale, Teladoc continues to post EPS losses. While revenues and sales continue to rise substantially, the company spends cash on further growing their business. There is a good possibility of future stock dilutions with secondary offerings to raise cash. The company might acquire more debt, and there is also a possibility of competition as others try to enter this business segment.We like this name for its growth potential and for the sector it is in. Teladoc is in the business of lowering healthcare costs, which meets a current market need. The company's revenues, users, and utilization continue to rise rapidly. They remain active in making new agreements with healthcare providers. This stock might be a getting in on the ground floor type of opportunity.Telehealth could become a much larger part of the overall healthcare system. The CEO's upbeat comments from the latest earnings call make me believe that this company will have a good year ahead. However, the stock has run up over 100% in the last 12 months already. This rise could be a potential risk. Has it gone too far to fast?To view more articles or blogs as soon as they are published, or to view previous articles, click here.

4161456,79675,2018-04-06T12:03:40-04:00,Teladoc is a growth company that is worth a look.Teladoc recently reported full-year 2017 results and provided 2018 guidance that supported the bull case for the company.I am long Teladoc and I plan to add shares on pullbacks.,"Teladoc (TDOC) has a goal to change the healthcare field as we know it. A little dramatic, yes, but the company's telehealth platform (and other related services) allow for patients to connect with their doctors without going in for a typical appointment. The platform connects doctors and patients through mobile devices, internet, video and the phone. And if you look out over the next few decades, I believe that this type of service will continue to experience tremendous growth.It is important to also note that the market has already taken notice, as shown by the fact that TDOC shares are up almost 70% over the last year.TDOC data by YChartsMore recently, however, the stock has been under pressure and is now trading in the lower $40 per share range. In my opinion, investors with a time horizon longer than three-to-five years should treat any pullbacks as long-term buying opportunities.Teladoc offers a differentiated service that has taken the industry by storm. The company has experienced broad-based growth and does not look to be slowing down anytime soon. For example, the company has grown its revenue by over 400% over the last four years (more on this below). But, more importantly, Teladoc has experienced strong growth almost across the board and the company has a significant market opportunity in the years ahead.Source: 38th Annual Cowen & Company HealthcareIt is hard not to get excited about the metrics highlighted in the slides above but let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet because Teladoc's earnings story is nothing to brag about. Yes, of course, Teladoc is still in the early innings of growth mode - the earnings pressure should not be a complete surprise, in my opinion - but I believe that the rising expense base adds a lot of risk into the equation.Source: Data from 2017 10-K, table created by W.G. Investment ResearchAs shown, the company's net loss has expanded materially since 2014 but it is encouraging that the Cost of revenue as a percentage of Revenue has been within the 26% range over the last three fiscal years.Teladoc is making headway in its industry and, in my opinion, the company's operating results (including expenses) prove it. To this point, operating expenses have continued to grow over the last four fiscal years. Observations from the table:All in all, Teladoc's operating results were pretty much in line with what investors should expect for an early-stage growth company - that is, significant top-line growth but an expanding net loss figure. It also helps the bull case that the company has a balance sheet that will support future growth.The company has a healthy balance sheet (current ratio above 3, a decent net debt position) but the goodwill balance is somewhat concerning (it currently that makes up over 50% of assets). Do I believe that the net loss will continue to outpace the company's revenue growth over the next two plus years? No, but I without a doubt believe that expenses will continue to rise from current levels.For prospective investors, there are two metrics that I would closely monitor throughout 2018 and 2019: 1) Cost of revenue as a percentage of Revenue, and 2) Revenue growth as a percentage of Operating expense growth (i.e., it will be concerning if the ratio floats back under 1).At the end of the day, I believe that Teladoc has great product/service offerings and the company is operating in an industry that has promising long-term prospects. This up-and-coming company has largely flown under the radar but, in my view, the market is finally starting to realize that Teladoc is well-positioned for the changing telehealth space.On Feb. 27, 2018, Teladoc reported adjusted Q4 2017 EPS of -$0.76 on revenue of $77.1M. The company's quarterly results missed on the bottom-line (missed by $0.25) but was a top-line beat ($0.94).A few highlights from the 2017 results:There was a lot to like about Teladoc's Q4 and full-year 2017 results but, in my opinion, the biggest takeaway from the earnings release (and guidance) was that this company is in a great position for not only the current year but also for the next few years. To this point, management provided the following full-year 2018 guidance:What's not to like about this guidance? Teladoc experienced impressive growth in fiscal 2017 but it is expecting an even better 2018 -- it's hard not to be encouraged about what the next four quarters may bring for Teladoc and its shareholders.Investing in small cap companies comes with many risks, but the major risk for Teladoc is related to the company being outspent by larger competitors. Additionally, the company relies heavily on its partnerships to expand its business so deteriorating relationships in the industry could have a material impact on Teladoc's business.Lastly, regulatory changes have the potential to greatly impact Teladoc's business. Please also refer to Teladoc's 2017 10-K for additional risk factors that should be considered before investing in the company.This is a high risk/high reward stock but there is a lot to like about what this company has been able to do over the last four years. I believe that Teladoc's strong revenue growth, coupled with impressive growth metrics (e.g., visits, memberships, etc.), supports the bull case for this disruptive company.I do not believe that it will be completely smooth sailing for Teladoc but, in my opinion, the risk is currently to the upside. With that being said, I believe that Teladoc deserves to be on most investor's watch lists because the company appears to have tremendous growth prospects for at least the next decade.Additional disclosure: I hold a small Teladoc position in the R.I.P. portfolio. I have no plans to sell any of my TDOC shares in the near future.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. These are only my personal opinions. Every investor must do his/her own due diligence before making any investment decision."
4109139,58361,2017-09-25T07:36:39-04:00,"Aetna renewal appears to eliminate access fees, commonly referred to a Per Member Per Month (PMPM) fees.Access fees represented 84% of revenue in the most recent quarter.$300M of net debt, $23M of annual interest expense, and continues to lose money.","In an article last week, we highlighted two recent developments that we believe significantly increase the risk profile of Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC). First, the company has taken on gross debt of $450M in the last three months to acquire Best Doctors. A fairly mature, relatively slow growth business that generated $6.5M of adjusted EBITDA last year. This leaves TDOC with approximately $300M of net debt and annual interest expense of roughly $23M for a business that continues to lose money. Second, we highlighted a recent large contract win with BCBS Federal Employee Program that looked positive on the surface, but that may not be the case after learning some details from Canaccord’s note published shortly after the announcement. The primary issue is that this contract would not have fixed access fees per member. This is commonly referred to as the Per Member Per Month (PMPM) fee that accounts for the majority of TDOC’s revenue (84% in the most recent quarter, a correction from the last article where we stated it was 74%). We highlighted this as potentially a material negative shift in the business model that should be watched closely given the natural risk of contagion as other customers renew their contracts. You can read the article here: Perilous Management Of Capital Structure Has Escalated The Risk At TeladocThe same day we published our article both JPMorgan and Oppenheimer published research notes highlighting TDOC’s renewal and expansion of its Aetna (NYSE:AET) contract. This is for the Aetna fully insured contract which accounts for about 4M of the 8.25M members TDOC has through Aetna. In addition to general medicine, members will now also have access to behavioral health, dermatology and caregiver services. Most of these details are from an Aetna press release (Aetna offers members behavioral health, dermatology and caregiver services through Teladoc - The Health Section) from last week. Both notes also state that the renewal eliminates the PMPM fee which was not in the Aetna press release. There is some reference to TDOC having the opportunity to share in Aetna’s savings, but it appears TDOC had to offer more services and give up guaranteed revenue to renew with Aetna. This was likely extremely high margin revenue given that Aetna, not TDOC, was previously in control of marketing this to its customers resulting in little incremental spend for TDOC.The elimination of the PMPM on the Aetna renewal strikes us as a significant negative development no matter what the spin is from the company or the publishing analysts. We believe this doesn’t bode well for the terms of the renewal of the other Aetna contract next year. Combined, Aetna accounts for roughly 8.25M of the 20.5M subscribers TDOC reported at the end of last quarter or 40% of the subs. We emphasize that we are relying on two analyst notes for the additional details about this Aetna renewal. The company has not issued a press release nor has it filed an 8-K with these details. This is similar to our last article where we were relying on publishing analysts for key details of what we view as significant contracts that we don’t see in press releases or 8-K filings made by TDOC."
4141387,51452,2018-01-30T15:12:44-05:00,"Teladoc is our recommendation in the wake of the announcement this morning by Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway.Teladoc has a cost-effective, tele-medicine technology that could be highly valuable to this powerful partnership.On its own, Teladoc has a bright future.","This morning, Amazon (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (BRK.B) announced a partnership to form a company to address employee healthcare in the U. S.Their goal is to improve employee satisfaction and reduce costs. The three large companies bring scale and they say complimentary expertise to this long-term effort. The company they form will be a non profit so free from profit-making constraints. It will be headed by an Amazon Senior Vice President, a JPMorgan Chase Managing Director and an investment officer of Berkshire.The initial focus of the new company will be on technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost.We anticipate this new company with partner with others that can bring valuable expertise to this new company and the delivery and providing of healthcare overall. The first company that comes to mind in this regard is strong buy-rated Teladoc (TDOC). There's nothing being announced this morning regarding the developments, nor has anyone we are aware of suggested this might occur. It is just our surmising. But we can imagine a Teladoc partnership with this new company or perhaps even an acquisition of Teladoc which has a current market capitalization of just $2.2 billion. Again, there is no indication that this new entity or anyone else has approached Teladoc so this is just our speculation based on the excellent fit we can see.Teladoc provides telehealth services using virtual care via phone, mobile device and other online platforms. And in some cases video calls. They provide 24/7 coverage for employees whose employers sign up with Teladoc to provide this service. They earn a per member/employee fee plus a fee for each tele-visit.Last July, Teladoc acquired Best Doctors (BD), a similar company with more international operations and more focused on more highly serious medical conditions. BD clients included Accenture, IBM, JNJ, Boeing, Facebook, Coca Cola and 3M. Prior to the BD acquisition, Teladoc did not have many top tier clients like these. BD increased Teladoc’s annual revenues from just under $200 million to about $300 million. On January 8th, Teladoc announced commercial availability of an integrated Teladoc-BD mobile app.On January 8, Teladoc also pre-announced Q4 at:For the 2018 year Teladoc management forecast:We view this guidance as conservative and positioned to be raised with each quarterly report this year. With 90% visibility at the beginning of the year it is highly likely that this guidance is well exceeded. But the growth rates were viewed by some investors as less than hoped so TDOC shares corrected the following seven trading days before rebounding most of the way back to their January 4 high of $38 to close at $36 yesterday.Teladoc is just the kind of forward-looking kind of company that we can imagine the new Amazon/JPMorgan/Berkshire venture wanting to incorporate into its plans for better healthcare delivery. And if does not happen, Teladoc's future is already bright, especially in a world more and more conscience of healthcare delivery effectiveness and costs.We suggest initiating positions in Teladoc shares in your growth portfolios."
4107218,58361,2017-09-15T08:55:45-04:00,TDOC paid $440M for a nearly 30-year old business that generated $6.5M of EBITDA in 2016.Large acquisition takes TDOC from $134M net cash position at the end of Q1 to a net debt position of $300M.Recent large contract win may signal a crack in the business model. Did TDOC sign a deal that doesn’t have access fees (per member per month fees)?$300M of net debt on a $282M revenue business (2H ’17annualized) that is expected to lose money through at least 2019.,"Shares of Teladoc (TDOC) have had a phenomenal run over the past year as sentiment towards the company’s fast growing but money losing business swung from pessimistic to extremely optimistic. The company has posted impressive revenue growth over the past year due to organic and acquisition driven growth and this is expected to continue for the next year due, in part, to the recent Best Doctors acquisition. Despite the revenue growth, the company has demonstrated little operating leverage in its business with revenue growing 64% Y-o-Y in the first half of 2017 but the EBITDA loss improving only 8% to a loss of $24M from a loss of $26.1M a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA improved significantly more, but mostly because TDOC has ramped up the use of stock based comp for employees by 166% during the comparable six months of last year. Loss from operations was roughly flat Y-o-Y in the first six months and net loss increased slightly. Operating leverage is expected to improve in the second half of this year and into 2018 with the company expected to be adjusted EBITDA positive in Q4.In June, TDOC announced the acquisition of Best Doctors (BD), a second opinion company that was founded in 1989. BD is a much slower growth, more mature business vs. TDOC’s core telemedicine business, but management believes there is some cross selling synergies to be realized. TDOC financed the acquisition by issuing shares and borrowing $450M through the issuance of convertible debt and a new term loan facility. While the most recent balance sheet doesn’t reflect the closing of the BD transaction, TDOC’s CFO provided an update on the balance sheet during the company’s earnings call in August. TDOC had $450M of total debt and a “little over $150M of cash”, resulting in net debt of approximately $300M. This strikes us as a massive amount of leverage for a company that is expected to generate $350M of revenue in 2018 and a small EBITDA loss. TDOC expects the debt to have a cash interest cost of roughly 5%, which equates to about $23M per year. To put that in perspective, BD had adjusted EBITDA of $6.5M last year (up from a loss of $13M the prior year). TDOC needs to nearly quadruple BD’s EBITDA to pay for the interest expense alone. TDOC management must believe they can dramatically increase BD’s business or they believe the stock will continue its upward trajectory and the convertible debt will convert to equity. There is a long list of companies (mostly tech companies) that have issued converts near the peak of bull markets assuming they would one day be equity only to have equity valuations come down and have to deal with the convert as debt when it came due. The BD acquisition might end up being transformative, but the debt taken on to buy the company has dramatically increased the risk profile of TDOC.Not long after closing the BD acquisition, TDOC announced a large win with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal Employees Program. Not only is this a great name plate, but they also have 5.3M covered members. This is substantial considering TDOC’s total subscriber base was 20.5M at the end of Q2. While this looks like a great win, the press release has essentially no details on the financial impact, which is not uncommon; however, several analysts published some details about the deal that most investors may be unfamiliar with. Details about the contract from Canaccord analyst Richard Close’s report notes:Why is this important? One of the primary points to multiple bear thesis that have been published on TDOC has been that subscription access fees would eventually go away as competition increases in the space and at least one major competitor is known to lead with a visit fee only model. To put in perspective how important access fees are for TDOC, in their most recent quarter access fees were 74% of revenue while visit fees were 26%. If it is true that TDOC won this business with no access fees then it would mark a significant shift in the business model and we have to wonder if other large customers would expect the same terms when contracts come up for renewal. Contagion is always a risk when a company provides a discount on a high-profile deal. (By the way, the fact that TDOC discussed such important contract details with an analyst and did not put them in a filing seems like selective disclosure to us, but that is another issue.)While TDOC is a leader in the fast growing telemedicine market the BD acquisition dramatically increases the stock’s risk profile. This risk may be compounded by an increasingly competitive market that may impact TDOC’s business model. The company is now levered at nearly 1x revenue, must generate $25M of adjusted EBITDA to be cash break even given the debt service, and is expected to lose money through at least 2019. Trading at roughly 7x 2018 revenue estimates, we believe TDOC is vulnerable to a significant pullback at the very least."
4147307,104119,2018-02-15T15:09:11-05:00,"Rule number one should always be the preservation of capital.

More than half of its capital structure is comprised of goodwill.As exciting as it may be as a takeout candidate, TDOC isn't worth the risk, in my opinion.","I can appreciate that some shareholders may consider Teladoc Inc. (TDOC) to be a potential takeout target. It may very well be. But due to the nature of the underlying business, I don't believe it is worth the risk. Buying a business with poor fundamentals because it might get taken out is, in my opinion, not investing, but speculating.There is a good reason to be cautious about avoiding downside - basically, the simple math of it all. If you lose 50% of your investment, you have to make 100% back - not just 50% - just to break even. Let's remind ourselves of the brutal reality of losing capital:Source: InvestopediaThe best way to protect ourselves from loss, I think, is to limit downside risk. Consider this table:Source: Google BooksAs we can see, gains that took years - 20 years! - to generate can be wiped out in a day when attention isn't paid to limiting downside risk.One significant reason to worry about TDOC is its recent equity offering last year. One of the things I first look at when I analyze a company is whether it is diluting its shareholders. In particular, research suggests that seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) have a significant negative impact on subsequent price and operational returns.Let's look at the research.An article in the Journal of Financial Economics suggests that firms engaging in seasoned equity offerings have significant negative returns in the subsequent five-year period (emphasis added):This is confirmed in an article in the Journal of Finance, which states (emphasis added):Considering the recency of TDOC's SEO, poor performance in the subsequent five-year period, this may not be very good news for TDOC shareholders. An article titled ""Equity Issues and Offering Dilution"" from the Journal of Financial Economics has some fascinating insights about why it might be bad news for investors (emphasis added):In other words (emphasis added):So, summing up, here are a few reasons we should be wary of firms that engage in SEOs:That may not be a very positive sign for TDOC shareholders going forward. One possibility is that TDOC management timed its equity offering to take advantage of shares it believed were overpriced.Source: TradingView.comInvestors may want to be cautious, as it is trading at nearly double that price. It also looks like the stock is hitting some resistance at that $34-$36 range. But that aside, let's consider the direct effects of its dilution on shareholder returns.Dilution is just one of the many risks that investors can face when they invest in a company, among risks like business risk, market risk, opportunity risk, inflationary risk, legislative risk. This risk - dilution risk - is one risk that a shareholder should attempt to avoid, in my opinion, to limit his or her downside. Even acquisitions funded with equity tend to fare worse for shareholders than those funded with cash:As we can see from the chart below that, over the last year, TDO has diluted its shareholders by about 112%.TDOC Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YChartsLet's see just how significant this is with a thought experiment.Let's say you buy 1,000 shares of TDOC today at ~$33.95, when TDOC has 61.15M million shares outstanding.Source: Author's Work.Let's say, over the next five years, TDOC achieves the unbelievably challenging feat of doubling its revenue. And, let's say, that because investors love to reward revenue and not much else, the stock price reflects that. Your risk has paid off!But during that time, let's assume that TDOC has similarly diluted its shareholder base. Now there are 129.6M shares outstanding.Source: Author's workHolding all else constant: instead of your shares being worth $67.90 per share, because of the dilution, they're now worth only $32.03 per share. Even though the company doubled its revenue, it increased its share count. That means that revenue per share has decreased from $3.17 to $2.99, instead of increasing to $6.33.Instead of your share of ownership being worth almost $68K, even though you made the correct directional call, now, simply because of management's decision to dilute those shares, they're only worth $32K.In other words, we're rewarded on a per share basis. And because of dilution, your return is muted. In my opinion, it's best to avoid this type of dilutive company.It is one thing to buy a potential acquisition target that has a strong fundamental business itself. It's quite another to buy potential acquisition targets with poor fundamentals. The case of Teladoc is an example of the latter, in my opinion, with e.g.:In fact, if we run a correlation analysis comparing its revenue and net income, we find that the two are actually significantly negatively correlated to a point of -0.85. In other words, growing its revenue seems to hurt its bottom line.TDOC Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsNext, goodwill. Goodwill represents a material portion of TDOC's capital structure - 62% - as we can see in the chart below.Source: Annual Numbers From YCharts, Author's CompilationExcess goodwill puts investors at risk of write-downs. Any impairment will incur an income charge that this company - with its negative earnings - simply cannot afford.I can appreciate investors investing in businesses that may represent potential acquisition targets. Yet, I believe that even more important is to limit downside, and we do that by investing - not speculating. The problem emerges when the potential takeout target is not itself a business with strong fundamentals. In the case of TDOC, with a negative earnings yield, more than half of its capital structure comprised of goodwill, negative earnings despite high revenue growth, and a history of dilution and a recent equity offering. Research shows that, historically, companies engaging in seasoned equity offerings go on to underperform significantly for the subsequent five-year period. This is something of which TDOC investors should be wary. In my opinion, Teladoc isn't worth the risk."
4094905,81646,2017-08-04T10:52:44-04:00,"Teladoc possesses a dominant market share in the emerging telehealth industry.Revenue growth, membership growth, and acquisitions indicate their market dominance will remain strong.Chronic losses with no near term prospects for profitability are a limiting factor in an otherwise compelling growth story.","Telehealth is seen by many as an emerging industry with increasing potential for patients and investors alike. The service offers patients the opportunity to see patients at any time without leaving their home, at a lower cost than a regular office visit. The company in the best position to exploit this opportunity is Teladoc (TDOC). Although Teladoc has the market share and investment capital to grow their business and this industry, the financial risk remains. With no history of profitability and no prospects to show a profit in the foreseeable future, investors have to decide whether Teladoc provides an investable opportunity.By most accounts, Teladoc offers a compelling proposition to patients. The company offers patients the ability to see a doctor online, receive a diagnosis, and if necessary, have a prescription transmitted to the pharmacy of their choice. The service is available 24 hours/day, seven days/week with minimal wait times and at a lower cost than seeing a physician at their office. The company employs approximately 3,000 physicians and behavioral health professionals who diagnose conditions ranging from upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, and dermatological conditions. They can also help with smoking cessation or anxiety. With a 75% market share in the telehealth industry, the company appears to be in a strong competitive position, a position further enhanced by completing its acquisition of Best Doctors in July. Best Doctors, a leading medical consultation company, brings together doctors to address complex and costly medical issues. By absorbing this company, Teladoc acquires a network of 50,000 medical experts with a reputation for quality outcomes. Combined with its dominant market share in the telehealth industry, this acquisition puts Teladoc in a stronger position to serve its growing customer base.What limits this company are the staggering losses and the lack of immediate prospects of achieving profitability. Teladoc showed a loss of $1.75/share in 2016, compared to a $2.91/share loss in the prior year. Further improvement is expected as 2017 losses are expected to come in at between $1.52 and $1.55/share. The company lost $15.4 million in the second quarter, or $0.28/share. While the market has a history of showing patience with promising new companies (the dot.com boom and Tesla’s (TSLA) recent success being prime examples), funding will eventually be difficult to come by if investors see no return on their investment capital. However, other numbers give investors hope for eventual profitability. For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, revenues were up 68% year-over-year to $44.6 million. Total membership grew by 33%, and total office visits were up 55% to 309,000. While this does not mean that profitability is around the corner, it is an indication that Teladoc’s trend of high growth is continuing.With this high growth, investors will have to decide whether the rising revenue, the increases in membership, and the acquisitions are enough to overcome a string of losses into the foreseeable future. Better service offerings, dominant market shares, and acquisitions that promise to improve outcomes are attributes that investors like to see. The question is, will investors show enough patience for profitability to catch up?"
4139855,103284,2018-01-24T15:36:56-05:00,Subscription business contributes almost 90% to overall revenue.Improved deal with Aetna increases revenue and future utilization rates.Mobile app for all clients is now live despite user complaints.Rising utilization rates continue to be of high priority.,"Teladoc (TDOC) is a telehealth company that uses phone and video conferencing to provide on-demand medical care. Teladoc was one of my favorite companies in 2017 and is gearing up to be my top pick for 2018. Over the past three months, it has made many announcements on the improvements to its insurance deals, the growth of its financial comps and memberships, and the release of an all-encompassing mobile application for its platform. All of these highlights are coming right before Q4/Q1 when Teladoc sees a seasonal boost in membership through new insurance sign-ups and increased utilization during the flu/cold season. I'm confident these changes can spur on continued growth for this stock in 2018 as it continues to make inroads towards becoming a household name in healthcare.As you may have known, Teladoc has been working with many large insurers over the years. Recently, changes were made to its biggest insurance deal with Aetna that provided increased profitability and opportunities for growth for the company.As Aetna's telehealth provider of choice, Teladoc is essentially saving money for Aetna by providing more efficient and less costly alternatives for patients to see doctors. Teladoc receives a doctor visit fee and also has agreements with Aetna to split the savings that the insurance giant is making from using its services. During the conference call, Lisa Gill from JPMorgan put it well:This is a big way in which the deal with Aetna was altered to provide Teladoc with more potential for profits and the ability to offer a wider range of products.One such product is the behavioral health entity. This part of the business currently contributes $25M to the company's top line as revenue grew by over 100%. CEO, Jason Gorevic also noted that this part of the business is seeing continued robust growth and could exceed 75% revenue growth going into 2018 as well.With the addition of behavioral health, dermatology, and many other specialty treatments, Teladoc has released an app to work with patients with a variety of ailments throughout its Teladoc and Best Doctors' networks.The app has been on the market for a few months but was only available on a limited release in Q4. Now it's live and available for everyone to download! I was quite excited about the new app and what it could do for the business, that is until I started reading reviews.Here's a screenshot of the reviews from Android downloads. Overall, there's a lot of five-star reviews, but it's a bit alarming to see nearly 16% of people had an awful time using the app and probably won't be coming back. Digging deeper I read the following comments:Here's a screenshot from the Apple reviews so far. There are only 243 ratings here as opposed to 1500+ on Android, but we can still see by the bar graph that over 40% of patients had a one-star rating on its service. As I dug deeper, I compiled a few more comments:Now obviously there were many positive reviews as well, but I wanted to highlight some of the horrible experiences people had so I can monitor these aspects of the company in upcoming quarters. From my research, it looks like the company is having trouble in these areas:These reviews were a game changer for me, so I'll definitely be keeping an eye on how management deals with the lack of doctors, doctor interactions, and network issues. I can imagine some of these issues have to do with scaling problems as Teladoc is growing so quickly, but either way, the amount of one-star reviews is appalling.Looking back to my section on the Aetna deal, you can see this is one of the new deals coming out that incentivizes increases in Teladoc's utilization rates. As Aetna is paying Teladoc a portion of the savings rate from telehealth visits, Aetna and Teladoc will both save money. Teladoc's advertisements and marketing expense increased 58.4% to $14 million in the most recent quarter as it prepared to ramp up its communications effort to boost its utilization with these majors insurers.One additional way to help this number was also outlined in Teladoc's work with a large west coast Blue Cross Blue Shield plan. Teladoc started the plan off with low PMPM fees (per-member per-month) and grew the PMPM fees as the utilization grew. Again, Blue Cross Blue Shield didn't mind higher PMPM fees because utilization was growing and saving them much more money on visit costs.In years past, various competitors have bashed the PMPM fee model, but at the end of the day, these fees are typically $0.45-0.55 per month which doesn't exactly break the bank when you consider overall medical insurance costs.Overall, I'm confident Teladoc can improve on some of the issues that have come up with its app and scalability. The app has only been on the market for a few months and the user experience should improve as the common issues get resolved. I'll be sure to check back on the reviews page in a few months to see any shifts in the average ratings. Apart from the app, I'm excited to see new, more aggressive deals made with Aetna as well as a focus on the utilization rate and driving more profits from visits and the savings shared from the insurance companies. Teladoc is definitely a stock to keep an eye on in 2018.Q3 Earnings CallQ3 10-Q ReportNov. 20 Investor Day"
4108832,22148,2017-09-22T12:50:26-04:00,Teladoc dips after a key analyst downgrade.The purchase of Best Doctors sets up the company to tackle a market with a $30 billion TAM.Turning EBITDA positive at the end of 2017 will make the stock more investable.,"As discussed back in late June, Teladoc (TDOC) has a promising future transforming healthcare. At the time, the problem was the stock trading at a questionable valuation with the looming Q3 guidance likely to whack the stock due to the impact from the Best Doctors deal.As predicted, Teladoc quickly dipped $7 to $28.60 during August. The question now is whether one bought the stock on the dip unlike me and whether one gets another opportunity after Baird downgraded the stock.Teladoc failed to rally on the Q2 results as expected since Best Doctors will impact the reported growth rates going forward. The guidance for achieving Q4 EBITDA positive wasn't too bad, but the stock now has a valuation of $1.7 billion and revenue growth that may only approach 20% on an organic basis when factoring in the $100 million revenue runrate for Best Doctors.The real news that moved the stock after the Q2 report was the Blue Cross Blue Shield federal program that adds some 5.3 million federal employees into the mix. Teladoc only forecast ending 2017 with up to 23 million memberships so this is a meaningful addition to the membership total when the Federal Employee Plan offers telehealth from Teladoc to the 2018 offering.The company now has a complete virtual health delivery platform matching 50,000+ doctors with the Teladoc platform. The future of healthcare is clearly virtual doctor visits with an estimated total addressable market of nearly $30 billion as existing doctor visits are treatable via telehealth.Source: Teladoc investor presentationThe key investor takeaway is that the Baird downgrade to Neutral provides another opportunity to buy Teleadoc at a discount. The $36 price target provides nearly 15% upside and would leave the stock at an attractive valuation to invest in the telehealth future of healthcare."

TDOC, as the only publicly traded telehealth company, has gained significant traction on the market. It is currently trading at its all-time high of $32, representing 11.4x LTM sales.Source: FactSetSince IPO, TDOC was considered as a growth company, aiming to transform the Healthcare industry via technology. TDOC's management has been aggressively driving the rapid growth of revenue, membership and visits. As you can read in the below chart, sell-side analysts liked TDOC a lot.Source: FactSetHowever, on the market, TDOC's short interest is very high. The current short percentage of float is 23.85%. As the following chart shows, TDOC's short interest has been above 20% in the past 11 months and actually peaked at 44.22% in Mar. 2017.Source: GuruFocusThis article is to explain why TDOC's short interest is so high. My 12-month price target of TDOC is $19, 39% lower than its current price of $31.65 as of June 9th, 2017.Business OverviewTDOC is the first and the largest telehealth company in the US. TDOC's shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on July 1, 2015, under the symbol ""TDOC"" and its IPO price was $19/share.On Jan. 24th, 2017, TDOC completed its follow-on offering with an issuance price of $16.75/share, receiving net proceeds of $123.9 million.TDOC serves two segments: ambulatory care and behavioral health that represent a $29 billion total addressable market.Source: Company presentationTDOC's client base can be categorized as follows:Source: Company presentationInvestment Thesis #1 - TDOC's top-line growth cannot sustain without burning cashTDOC reported terrific business performance in the past years, which is very self-explanatory in the following charts:Source: Company presentationHowever, to maintain this kind of high growth rates, TDOC has been spending significantly. As shown in the below chart, G&A expense accounted for the largest portion, and the total expense of sales, marketing, technology and G&A significantly exceeded 100% of revenue. My relatively conservative projection for 2017 shows both negative EBITDA margin and adj. EBITDA margin throughout 2017.My estimation of TDOC expenses and Adj. EBITDA margin:TDOC Cost StructureThe management of TDOC set up an aggressive goal of adj. EBITDA break-even in Q4 2017, with which I am not convinced at all. Instead, my projection of adj. EBITDA margin is around -20% in 2017E and 2018E, assuming 40%+ top-line growth. The following table includes the projection of 2017E to 2021E, from which you can understand the cash burning of TDOC (Cumulative adj. EBITDA loss is $418M during 2017E to 2021E) in the next couple of years.Source: My estimation of TDOC revenue and EBITDAMy view is that TDOC is unlikely to greatly decrease operating expenses while maintaining over 40% top-line growth for a few reasons.1) Strong competition in the telehealth marketTelehealth market can be described in two key words: attractive and low barrier to entry. According to Becker's Health IT and CIO Review, the global telehealth market is projected to reach $9.35 billion by 2021, growing at a CAGR of 27.5%. The barrier to entry is considered low because the main technology is audio/video communication that has a lot of mature product offerings on the market. With that, although TDOC is a dominant player, the company would not have very strong pricing power due to the existence of numerous large, medium and small players.American Well, MDLIVE, Doctor On Demand, etc. are all competing in the market. More importantly, some competitors possess more advanced technology and provide differentiated services from TDOC.2) Expectation of capital marketThe key driver of TDOC's stock price is top-line growth, membership growth and visits growth. Those terrific numbers essentially made the stock price triple in the past year.In the following quarters, I think TDOC will have to deliver high growth as usual; otherwise, the stock is likely to be penalized on the market. To fuel its growth, TDOC will have to continue acquiring new customers by spending heavily in sales and marketing.3) Labor intensive business natureAccording to the above chart of the TDOC cost structure, G&A accounted for 32% of total operating costs. This is because TDOC is running a very costly call center to support telehealth visits. Even if mobile app is going to help a bit, I do not expect TDOC to quickly transition to a cost-effective machine-based platform.4) Low adoption rate of end usersIs it easy to drive the growth of TDOC through lifting customer adoption? Not really. Let me explain with numbers.Although TDOC has a member base of 20 million members, the annual total visits of 2 million indicate an average of 0.1 visits/member has been achieved. TDOC also reported 1.3 visits/user on an annual basis, which means repeat users only account for 30% of annual users. In addition, my calculation using 1.3 visits/user and 20 million members shows TDOC's service is only adopted by 8% of its total members on an annual basis.This low customer adoption shows the disconnection between TDOC's aggressive customer acquisition and the actually limited value creation for end users. With that, I do not think TDOC is able to quickly ramp up customer adoption in a short period.In summary, I think TDOC is unlikely to achieve the goal of Adj. EBITDA break-even in Q4 2017. Instead I would expect TDOC to continue burning cash so as to effectively fuel the top-line growth.Although I believe overall the company is well positioned for the future telehealth, there are numerous challenges (as shown in the below chart) to overcome.Barriers to leveraging telehealthSource: AviziaInvestment Thesis #2 - Insider trading shows TDOC management's lack of confidenceThe following table shows all insider trading transactions reported in company filings. I think the recent selling by CEO and CFO indicated that they might want to sell high, and even maybe they lack confidence in TDOC's future growth.Insider trading reportsSource: Company filingsIn the mean time, I think it would help to look at how the management team is compensated. According to the recent TDOC proxy, the cash incentive program is based on corporate performance as measured against targets for revenue (60%), earnings (20%), member satisfaction (10%) and visit volume (10%).I think this suggests that revenue represents the most important metrics among all the factors listed above. Therefore, I expect management will be motivated to drive TDOC's further top-line growth by aggressive advertising, sales and marketing.ValuationFor a start-up like TDOC, I think EV/Sales would be the most appropriate way for its valuation.As the below table shows, tech companies such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) NEVER trade at 4-7x, AI darling NVIDIA (NVIDIA) 11x, and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) 35x. In contrast, TDOC's own comparable companies in healthcare IT sector are trading at 0.6-5x. I used the following comps from different sectors to arrive at 6.5x EV/Sales multiple for TDOC's valuation. With that my price target is $19, representing 39% upside.Comp ValuationInvestment Risk: I think the biggest risk is that short squeeze might occur.Catalyst: Q4 2017 earnings release would be a catalyst. There are two possibilities: first, growth expectation is not met; second, the goal of adj. EBITDA break-even is not achieved. In either of the above scenarios, TDOC's stock price would drop.ConclusionBased on my comp valuation, TDOC appears to be overvalued by ~39% on the market.Moreover, I think TDOC is not able to achieve the goal of rapid top-line growth and bottom-line improvement simultaneously due to TDOC's relatively low customer adoption, labor-intensive business and the various challenges prohibiting the growth of telehealth."

4084308,22148,2017-06-27T14:38:25-04:00,"Teladoc is building the leading platform for medical consultation.
        The stock trades at a double top corresponding with the initial trading following the IPO in 2015.
        The recent purchase of Best Doctors adds access to valuable doctors, but lowers the growth rates.","Teladoc (TDOC) has gone mostly unnoticed as a futuristic provider of virtual health services. Patients find quicker and more efficient access to health solutions offering a revolutionary change in healthcare, but the $2 billion stock has very few followers on investment sites. The question though is whether investing in this telehealth stock offers a solid investment. The stock that dipped below $10 last year has already soared 250% off the lows suggesting new investors are possibly already late to the party. The company recently bought Best Doctors to create a best of suite telehealth platform offering consultations with the best doctors in the world. Anyone can see the vision that connecting patients around the world with the best medical experts without the requirement for travel would create an attractive healthcare solution. The Q1 results for Teladoc offer a glimpse into the potential of these assumptions with revenues growing 60% and organic growth up over 40%. The company is aggressively growing memberships and visits via digital marketing though this comes with high costs and adjusted EBITDA losses. The addition of Best Doctors for $440 million in mostly cash may actually hurt the revenue growth though that business is turning profitable. The medical consultation company generated 2016 revenues of $92 million and will top $100 million this year. The business will have a material impact on growth considering Teladoc guided towards $185 million on its own. The offset is that Best Doctors generates positive adjusted EBITDA that will help boost Teladoc out of the negative column this year. The downside is that the medical consultation firm comes with slower growth attached. Best Doctors claims access to 45,000 medical experts in over 450 medical specialties. According to internal reports, access to these top doctors provide patients with not only better outcomes, but also substantial cost savings due to a modification of the diagnosis and treatment from a prior doctor. Source: Teladoc/Best Doctors merger presentation If the company can use the telehealth platform to prove out the cost savings and more importantly better health outcomes, Teladoc has a home run solution. The stock gets interesting on a dip as Teladoc hits a double top around $35 corresponding with the top back after the IPO back in 2015. Despite the intriguing combination of the leading medical consultation company with a top telehealth platform, the impact is a slower growth rate. Teladoc had originally forecast revenue growing 50% in 2017 and the addition of Best Doctors has the effect of slowing that growth down to around 35%. The stock was trading at about 10x revenue forecasts prior to the deal and the expectation is that the market doesn't fully appreciate the growth impacts. The key investor takeaway is that Teladoc has been on a long run over the last year. The stock appears poised to take a pause or pull back as investors fully grasp that the merger impacts growth rates and multiples likely applied to the stock that is no longer mostly focused on a platform as a service. Investors should wait for a pullback surrounding the Q2 results when the company outlines the updated projections for the rest of the year."
4079793,81646,2017-06-08T01:32:16-04:00,Telemedicine is on its way to mainstream acceptance.Teladoc already has a 75% market share in the industry.Revenues and customer numbers are growing quickly.,"One industry that's increasingly embracing the Internet revolution is the medical industry. Due to advances in virtual healthcare, prospective patients can now connect online with a medical doctor, have a consultation and receive a recommended treatment plan. While virtual healthcare cannot replace all in-person doctor visits, many seeking consultations can save substantial amount of time and money by utilizing virtual healthcare.Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) is a company with a dominant market share in this industry, believed to be about 75%. Teladoc offers a compelling value prospect to customers. With the Teladoc system, a general consultation with a board-certified physician will cost as little as $40. This is substantial financial savings to patients, as a consultation in a traditional physician's office often starts at and exceeds $130. Unlike one's hometown general practitioner, patients can contact a Teladoc physician 24 hours/day, 7 days/week. In most cases, the patient will receive a diagnosis and if need be, a prescription transmitted to the patient's pharmacy of choice. While the patient cannot get a specific physician of their choice, they benefit in time savings as the average call-back time is only about 8 minutes. The flexible hours also allow patients to see physicians without taking time off from work, which is a huge selling point for employers who are often covering employer health insurance costs.Teladoc also has financials that will appeal to stock investors. In the first quarter of 2017, revenues grew by an astounding 59.5% to almost $42.9 million, with total revenues for 2016 reaching $123.2 million. Membership also increased by 43% last year, to 17.5 million. Despite these large growth numbers, TDOC has a market cap that's still under $2 billion at the time of this publication. Investors can still buy in at a comparatively early time, and the price is only marginally higher than its IPO closing price of $28 from two years ago. After falling below $10, the price recovered and is now hovering near 52-week highs. Institutional investors have already taken notice. The company received $50 million in debt financing from Silicon Valley Bank in July 2016. More recently, in March Tiger Global Management also took a 9.03% stake in Teladoc. Tiger is run by Chase Coleman, a seasoned investor in the Internet industry who made early investments in companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Priceline (PCLN). The one major negative in the financial statement is Teladoc's net losses, though financials are improving. After a $2.91/share loss in 2015, losses have fallen to $1.75/share in 2016 and are predicted to further improve going forward.Considering the time and financial savings, virtual healthcare can be a winner for patients, employers, and investors alike. With a commanding market share and impressive growth numbers, Teladoc is a stock that has Silicon Valley and Internet investors paying attention. With lower costs and shorter wait times, patients are likely to flock to virtual doctors in increasing numbers for many ailments. As virtual healthcare becomes more well-known and widely accepted, Teladoc is well-poised to increase revenue, achieve profitability, and bring its investors substantial returns."
4056631,101442,2017-03-20T15:46:54-04:00,"Teladoc is still unprofitable, though still seeing strong double-digit growth in revenues.Once SG&A expenses level off to about 30% of revenues, the company should see adjusted operating margin expansion to 25%.An important concern is low utilisation rate, which must be improved for the company to remain viable.My one-year-old value of $18 is revised up to about $24, following this year's valuation.","About a year ago, I wrote one of my first articles here on Seeking Alpha, where I provided a valuation analysis on Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC). Trading at $12 a share at that time, I was valuing the stock at around $18. One year on, the stock price is at roughly $23, with 90%+ capital gain. On this occasion, I have decided to revalue Teladoc and come to the conclusion that the market is finally just about right about the company even after taking into account one of the biggest concerns about the viability of TDOC.ThesisOne year on, Teladoc is still not profitable, which should not be much of a surprise, given how relatively young the company is, low overall telehealth market penetration, and considerable investments in infrastructure (such as call centres, technology, sales teams) TDOC implements to support future growth. This very fact does not mean, however, there is nothing we can use to analyse its performance. Unlike its competitors, Teladoc implements a subscription-based business model, implying that each participant pays a per-employee-per-month (PEPM) subscription fee, which gives an access to the telehealth providers' network of physicians; participants are then charged a fee on each visit carried out during the year by each employee. While some people view this approach on the part of the company as risky (only one-year-long contracts across the participants), non-conformant with the industry ""standard"" (visit fee only), or even doomed to fail (80%+ of revenues comprise subscription fees), my personal take is not that radical.First, even though contracts are only one year in length, participants are effectively locked-in for the duration of 12 months, providing Teladoc with, at least, subscription fee until the contract expires; this is not the case for other players in the industry, which may see customers switching to and fro as well as experience lower predictability in revenue streams.Second, despite high overall per-visit fees above $120 (consisting of visit and subscription fees, given PEPM model), there is an obvious downward trend, with both overall and subscription access fees per visit declining, as evidenced from the graph below. Moreover, fees per visit have remained roughly unchanged and low at about $24 on average.An unsurprising conclusion of the figure above is that higher utilisation rates should drive the overall per-visit fees down at the expense of lower access fees per visit, which is good news for participants. This turns out to be a major aspect that still bothers me, however, as the low rate of employee utilisation has hit just above 5% in 2016. Additionally, as the table below indicates, rising utilisation rates during the last three years are mostly attributed to an increase in the number of members rather than visits from existing members (23% of visits due to higher utilisation from existing members in 2016 as a proportion of an overall change in visits compare poorly to 59% in 2014).The good news, however, is that an improvement to only 23% of utilisation rate (keeping Teladoc's average per-visit fee at $24 and assuming no improvement in the number of subscribers) will dwindle overall per-visit fee from the current level of $129 (see graph above) to $49, which is the typical telehealth visit fee charged by such competitors as Doctor on Demand and MDLIVE. As a consequence, any further improvement in the utilisation rate will pull the overall per-visit fee even lower.ValuationAs always, I will value the stock using a three-stage DCF model, taking into account the following assumptions and considerations:The ratio has been relatively stable over the years, and I have applied a four-year aggregate ratio of 1.39 in my model.4. Risk - Teladoc is a young company with high risk - high growth profile and U.S.-based operations only. As a result, the cost of capital of 9.02% that I will apply during the transition period of five years will reflect the risk of the typical U.S. company in the 95th percentile. As the company matures, its risks will converge from year 6 to year 10 to the median U.S. company's WACC of 7.22%.Apart from these major assumptions, I have also assumed the following:The table below presents the model output results:The resulting value per share is about $24, which is just 2% above the current price of around $23. Once again, I have run the Monte Carlo simulation to look at the range of possible values, assuming the following:The resulting distribution shows that the median value is $23.45, which is very close to the base case value that I obtained of $23.91 (an unsurprising result given that my distribution assumptions have all been around the base case). It also shows how close the current price of around $23 is to the median, suggesting that the market value of the company is just about right now.ConclusionOne year after writing a valuation article on Teladoc, the stock price has performed so well that it increased from $12 at the time to a price level even beyond my value of $18. As a consequence, I decided to revalue the stock and see what value I would attach to the company now. My narrative has largely remained the same. Teladoc is a young growth company in a newly formed and blossoming industry of telehealth services; even though TDOC is unprofitable, it has invested and continues to invest much in infrastructure, which has translated into a strong double-digit growth in revenues; once the expenses level off, it should allow the company to improve its margins in the future. The greatest concern, however, is the low utilisation rate, which must be improved to support the viability of the company and its value, which I estimate to be roughly equal to the current stock price in the range of $23-24."
4092585,101950,2017-07-31T03:57:46-04:00,"Teladoc has a 75% market share of the telehealth industry, linking patients and doctors via smartphone or computer.They provide 24/7 medical help and are convenient for people without a nearby primary care doctor.They are experiencing rapidly growing memberships, visits and revenues.","It’s always amazing to find companies that have a commanding grip on an up-and-coming growth industry. One of the best examples of a company like this today is Teladoc (TDOC), the only major pioneer in the field of telehealth. Teladoc is, essentially, a service that provides virtual doctor’s appointments. With Teladoc, customers talk to licensed family practitioners and pediatricians and certified internists in their state. Of course, there are some illnesses or problems that someone must be physically examined for, but Teladoc is designed to handle non-emergent medical problems, like cold/flu, sinus, respiratory issues, and allergies, and they also provide assistance with behavioral help visits. After the appointment, the doctor can prescribe medicine electronically to a pharmacy of the patient’s choice.Even if you are not familiar with this company, they could very well be part of your current employer’s medical insurance plan. Teladoc has over 17 million members and over 7500 clients, including more than 200 fortune 1000 companies. This all adds up to a dominating 75% market share, as they have over 1.25 million visits in 2016 with a member satisfaction rate of over 90%.Convenience is a huge factor when looking at Teladoc’s appeal, as they can be accessed via smartphone rather than a car trip and possibly lengthy wait at a primary care doctor’s office. The company strongly appeals to the more than 65 million people who live without immediate access to a nearby healthcare facility by giving them access to medical attention that all people should have. The cost is another appealing factor; appointments for ambulatory care (cold/flu/respiratory) is $40, and appointments for behavioral health are $89. This is especially helpful for behavioral health patients, as 50% of psychiatrists do not accept insurance, and only about 45% of US adults with mental health conditions received services last year. Lastly, Teladoc is a 24/7 service, giving them yet another advantage over typical primary care centers with limited hours.Teladoc is also appealing from a financial standpoint, with strong increasing revenues and a much larger cash position ($176 million) than debt ($44 million). As the chart below shows, the number of members to their service has tripled, the number of visits has increased more than six-fold, and their utilization rate has more than doubled all since 2013. This is the picture of an industry experiencing massive growth, and Teladoc is right at the forefront. Not shown in the chart is their impressive revenue growth, from $43.5 million in 2014 to $123.2 million in 2016: 183% growth in just two years.Teladoc expects 2017 to continue this high-growth trend at almost the same pace as they capture more of the wide-open market. This year, they will gain around 5 million new members and receive over one million visits, increasing their overall revenues by $60 million.The fact that they are a largely virtual company also minimizes their overhead costs, which is a main reason that their appointment prices are so reasonable.Overall, Teladoc sees their current business as a $29-billion market opportunity. Last year, there were estimates of 1.25 billion visits for ambulatory care and 168 million visits for behavioral health. Teladoc estimates that 33% of ambulatory care visits and about 80% of behavioral health visits will be able to be treated via telehealth. Based on their current rates of $40 per ambulatory visit and $89 per behavioral visit, these fields would make $17 billion and $12 billion, respectively.Currently, Teladoc already has a wide variety of service options with those ambulatory and behavioral health options listed above. However, they are in the early stages of implementing even more services, such as tobacco cessation, sexual health, and dermatology. This will open the market opportunity for Teladoc even more: 32 million people want to quit smoking, with STD rates on the rise there are likely to be more and more people getting tested, and about 85% of United States residents aged 12-24 (a key demographic for smartphone users) have acne and could use Teladoc for dermatology.I think the recent story about Amazon (AMZN)’s 1492 service “secretly” working on healthcare projects was blown out proportion, sending Teladoc’s stock down for no good reason. Even if Amazon does decide to break into this niche market of telehealth, it would likely be years from now, after Teladoc has an even sturdier grip on the market. If anything, Amazon could offer to buy Teladoc’s service; acquisitions have been their method of choice recently to break into new markets, and there is no better company in the telehealth field right now than Teladoc."

An avid example of this phenomenon is the widely developing telemedicine industry with Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) at the heart of it. Having read the recent article about TDOC from the Institutional Investor Magazine (2016), I decided to have a closer look at the company, its financials, the industry, and, last but not least, its valuation.From what will follow, the readers will understand why I believe Teladoc is currently undervalued.ThesisI strongly believe that focusing not only on the company but also on the landscape it operates in is a valuable approach to help any prospective investor make a more informed investment decision, which is what I will implement in this section. However, to commence the analyses, it is essential to accurately define what the industry is for Teladoc. According to the company's initial registration form filed for last year's IPO (S-1, 2015), Teladoc is a telehealth company.Unfortunately, the telehealth industry is both too young and represented by only one public company, which happens to be Teladoc itself. Additionally, Teladoc is not a healthcare company per se; rather, it is a platform enabling patients to seek medical consultation from physicians. As a result, I am more inclined to view TDOC as some sort of healthcare information technology, or even an internet company, as seen by MIT Technology Review. This approach will be important when we discuss margin assumptions, for example, because, for lack of any data related to the telehealth industry, a proxy will form the necessary basis.As already mentioned above, the telehealth industry the company operates in is relatively young. Even though it all started out some 40 years ago (American Telemedicine Association, 2016), it was Teladoc that shaped the industry the way we can see it today. Not surprisingly, the success of the company attracted much attention not only from its customers but also from the competition, leading to the formation of about 15 telehealth service providers in the USA alone (and this number is likely to rise, as the industry grows and its profitability improves), with such names as American Well, Doctor on Demand, MDLive, CareClix, and MeMD.Furthermore, apart from legal and regulatory restrictions in some states (though, mostly strict rather than prohibitive), there are few barriers to entry for potential new firms. Despite this competition, however, the industry has an attractive growth potential of more than $3.6bln for the US market alone and medications and consultation services only (for more details, see the discussion of revenue growth assumption in the valuation section below).To compare, the revenues of Teladoc (which is the industry leader) stood at only $77mln in 2015. The company is well positioned to exploit this potential, given its 14-year-long experience of operations and considerable investments in the growth base, such as a 168% increase in its headcount in 2015, primarily due to the establishment of the call center, considerable base of physicians and behavioural health professionals of 3,000 to support telehealth visits (with more than 820 thousand active physicians in the US alone, there is substantial ability to growth this figure, should it be necessary) and continuing investments in technology and development (nearly flat at 18% of yearly net revenues in each of the available 3 years of operations data).With regard to the telehealth visit service the company offers, it is important to consider whether clients have any substitutes to choose from, especially if Teladoc fails to provide the anticipated service. First, clients may switch ""e-visit"" with a traditional visit to a doctor. Second, they may simply substitute Teladoc's e-visit with that of one of its competitors. Given the telehealth industry's cost advantage relative to the traditional (physical) healthcare visit (on average, a single telehealth visit across all providers costs around $40-$60 versus $100-plus office visit and $1,000-plus emergency room visit), the former point is going to lose its impact as the telehealth industry grows and as patients realize that most of their visits, except for special cases, can be treated by a telehealth provider.The latter point, on the other hand, is of greater threat to the company, and especially so, because there are few switching costs, which for Teladoc can be measured in terms of a year - a typical contract length (in October, for example, the company has been reported to have lost $1.5 million worth of expired contract from a health-insurer Highmark to its competitors). For now, however, the industry is not saturated for this issue to be critical, and given the pace of growth, client churn can be expected and does not pose a real threat.ValuationAs in my previous article, I will use the three-stage Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) model to value TDOC. Similarly, I will first provide the analyses underlying some of the most important assumptions I made in the model, which can be thought of as key three drivers of the company value:1) Growth, defined as the growth in the rate of sales, for Teladoc is related not only to the rate it charges its customers for the so-called ""per-member-per-month"" (PMPM) subscription access and visit fees but also, and more importantly, to the number of members and visits (the latter, in turn, depends on the utilization rate).Apart from its main source of revenues, there is also great potential to generate sales from marketing data analytics of population health across the US, which the company gets in real-time thanks to its health providers working off of a single platform (Institutional Investor, 2016). By the admission of the company's CEO Jason Gorevic,To be more conservative in my projections, I will ignore this potential source of revenue and focus on the core engine of the company's sales.For the next 5 years, I will assume the revenues to grow at 55%. From year 5 to year 10, this rate will linearly decline to the perpetual growth rate of 1.79% (end-of March 2016 10-Year Treasury note rate). To check the validity of the assumed growth rate, we can look at how projected revenues at the end of a 10-year horizon compare to the potential size of the industry.To put it into perspective, I will ignore the fact that Teladoc offers a wide range of services, ranging from non-emergency medical issues to dermatological conditions to behavioural health issues, and focus only on two simple reasons of carrying out a telehealth visit - prescription refill (this reason is supported by an independent survey conducted by Harris Poll for American Well) and consultation.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are about 31,269 thousand medication and consultation visits to a physician annually in the US. According to the survey by Harris Poll, 64% of respondents (a nationally representative sample) are willing to have a video visit with a doctor. Taking the aforementioned figures as well as considering the fact that an average American visits a doctor about 4 times a year (Statista, 2014) and each e-visit currently costs around $45, we can calculate the approximate revenue potential of that small segment of the telehealth industry (hence, the use of the word ""partial"" below):Partial Revenues = 31,269,000*64%*4*$45 = $3.6blnThese assumptions imply there will be about 20 thousand e-visits per year, and even though Teladoc's capacity currently stands at 3.65 thousand (10-K, 2015), the platform is highly scalable, further signifying this assumption as both realistic and implementable at a higher scale.To compare, my revenue assumption in year 10 is $1.88bln, indicating a 52% market share for TDOC. This is a conservative figure, given Teladoc's market leading position and especially when taking into account the fact that only medication and consultation visits were considered.2) Target profitability is defined simply as the pre-tax EBIT margin (though adjusted for operating leases). Since the company's current and historic EBIT margin is not meaningful (operating profit has been negative), my earlier assumption of the industry proxy is a valuable guide to what this target rate should be approximately for Teladoc. According to the 5-year US (since TDOC's operations are in the US only) industry average figures I compiled from the current and historic data provided by Damodaran, median pre-tax operating margin for the healthcare information and technology sector is 12.85%, while for software (internet) sector it is at 18.84%. Given the above-average growth and profitability potential of the telehealth industry as a whole as well as its linkage to IT and internet (with corresponding profitability figures mentioned above), I will assume target profitability rate for the company to be 15%.3) Efficiency of growth is computed as the ratio of sales to capital and allows calculating the size of reinvestments (net capex plus working capital) the company makes to support future growth. Once again, proxy industry 5-year median figures are valuable in forming assumptions. Healthcare IT sector (Damodaran, 2016) posted 1.24, software (internet) ratio stood at 1.21, and Teladoc's own sales to capital figure was 1.14 for the year 2015. So as to not underestimate the level of reinvestments TDOC will need on its development path, relative to the abovementioned industry proxies, I will use a lower (i.e. company's own) ratio of the three presented.The table below presents the FCFF model valuation summary:As can be seen, the estimated value is around $18, which implies that at the current price of about $12, there is an upside potential of approximately 52%.As I already mentioned in my previous article, this estimated base value lies on a range of possible ones, given a change in the aforementioned input parameters. Following my previous logic, I conducted a Monte Carlo analysis, as a result of which I estimate there is around a 65% chance the current stock price is undervalued. This outcome further signifies the proposition that the stock is currently trading below its intrinsic value.Variant ViewMuch of Teladoc's ability to generate future revenues depends on how successful its fee structure proves to be. In short, there are two contract types for potential clients: (1) PMPM subscription fee structure with unlimited visits and (2) a small monthly subscription access fee with contractually defined cost for each visit. Currently, in excess of 80% of the company's revenues are generated through subscription fees. As such, the key to the success of this revenue scheme is member utilization rate, which, though rising, stands at only 4.72%, 3.69%, and 2.05% as of 2015, 2014, and 2013 year-ends, respectively. Furthermore, higher utilization rate in 2015 versus 2014 contributed only 45% to an improvement in total visits (the other 55% are attributed to an increase in the number of members), compared to 77% between 2014 and 2013 year periods.Moreover, one of Teladoc's major competitors MDLive has a less sophisticated fee structure based on a per visit payment of $49 and no subscription access fees (other competitors have a similar structure). Should TDOC's foresight turn out to be wrong, it is questionable the company will manage to generate double-digit growth in revenues and may even fail to retain key clients, once their typical yearlong contracts expire.To avoid this scenario, it is important for the company to engage with its clients more thoroughly, promote member utilization figures, and show them the access fee they pay for a 3,000-physician network is valuable and worth it.ConclusionThe outcome of this report is that I currently view Teladoc's stock as undervalued with as much as 52% of price appreciation in the future. The catalysts for materialization of this analysis are continuing strong growth figures of reported sales, at least for the next 5 years, and improving (and positive) operating profit margins.With all this knowledge of the company's prospects in mind, we can finally consider what possible choices investors and traders have at their disposal:1) Current shareholders should consider holding the stock, in anticipation of a likely price appreciation. Since markets can be inefficient for extended periods, this price appreciation may not be immediate, at least not until the aforementioned catalysts materialize. For those investors who considered selling the stock and may now be puzzled over what next step they should take, given the conclusions of the current report, I would suggest sticking with the stock but limit their ""fear factor"" by selling out-of-the-money call options at strike prices around the valuation point of $18 (this will allow collecting the premium, while the stock price is below the target, as well as participate in stock appreciation and ultimate sale, once written options are exercised).2) For prospective investors, this is an opportune moment to buy Teladoc's shares, especially when taking into account the fact that prices have substantially declined since last summer. Once again, to limit the risk inherent in direct stock purchases, some may consider implementing a long call or bull spread option strategies. While this is a viable and less costly alternative, these strategies suffer from time decay, meaning options may expire before stock price adjustment. Since I take a long-term view on the stock, any bull-based option strategy is not something I would personally recommend.3) Traders should avoid trading in this stock based on the conclusion of my analyses simply because of their short-term horizons, as opposed to the long-term view I take on this stock."

His short thesis had several relevant arguments, including:By itself, The Street Sweeper already made a convincing argument for selling short Teladoc. This led me to do my own due diligence on the stock. What I present below is the result of that due diligence.Additional Due DiligenceMy due diligence confirmed The Street Sweeper's thesis, but it also added a few additional reasons to sell short the stock, namely:Overall, what this added information represents is a business undergoing a significant slowdown. Since the business operates at an EBITDA loss and all it has to convince investors is its growth, this is very relevant for the stock. Moreover, the emergency acquisition means management is keenly aware of this slowdown and is trying to mask it. Finally, the reduced guidance means that even the attempts to mask it are being insufficient.ConclusionMy added due diligence on Teladoc confirmed The Street Sweeper's short thesis and added that the company is seeing a rapid slowdown in growth that's being masked by an emergency acquisition.The company guided lower in spite of having bought a fast-growing business (HealthiestYou had revenues of $10 million for the whole of 2015, and $8 million for just H1 2016). This means even the acquisition is being unsuccessful at masking business troubles.In light of this, at ~6.4x EV/sales and running at a deep EBITDA loss, Teladoc is a clear short."

        The company faces tremendous competitive risks from alternatives and other telemedicine companies.
        Despite strong growth, Teladoc has yet to turn a profit and is priced at very high valuations.","OverviewTeladoc (NYSE:TDOC) is bringing next-generation healthcare to Wall Street with early success. The company priced its initial public offering at $19 a share, just to begin trading in excess of $30 a share. And, in the first few days of trading, is slowly sliding to below $27 per share. The IPO marks Teladoc as a clear leader in the emerging healthcare delivery platform. However, early investors should be concerned about future threats and the growth rate until Teladoc commands its current valuation.Platform & Business ModelTeladoc's early success has been its ability to build its platform for specific needs of clients, health providers, and consumers. The company built a platform for physicians to interact effectively and easily with patients. The platform is both easily scalable and customizable based on the population being addressed. The company also makes a great value proposition for clients like large employers or insurance companies looking to reduce their healthcare expenditure. By moving healthcare to a technology-based business mode and away from a hospital or clinic setting costs are reduced and efficiency is improved.Source: Teledoc S-1Value PropositionTeladoc really has 3 types of customers, and the platform offers a unique value proposition to each. First, patients basically get a doctor in demand. They can use a multitude of devices including phones and computers to quickly connect with a physician and receive medical advice and prescription treatment. Second, Physicians that join the platform can improve efficiency over traditional clinic-based practices and reduce back-office headaches like billing and scheduling by letting the Teledoc platform handle the heavy lifting. Finally, clients like insurers can significantly reduce costs. The platform solves major access issues by enabling members to receive care without waiting for an appointment. Faster treatment reduces long-term costs. The platform also allows for low cost treatments, running a call center with a computer for the doctor is a lot cheaper than running a full-scale clinic with nurses, receptionists, and technicians.Source: Teledoc S-1National health insurer, Aetna (NYSE:AET), has been instrumental to Teladoc's success. The company was an early adopter of telemedicine in 2011, and since then has continued to roll-out the platform to a variety of clients and populations. The company first rolled out the platform to privately-insured clients who were able to reduce costs of low-level clinic and primary care-type appointments. Since then, the launch has been successful enough to roll the model out to certain Medicaid HMO populations in order to control costs. Members could also grow as Aetna acquirers Humana (NYSE:HUM).Source: Teledoc S-1FinancesOver the past few years, Teladoc has experienced tremendous growth. The company posted over 120% annual growth from 2013 to 2014. The growth was largely spurred by both healthcare reform and a growing desire to transform healthcare delivery models. However, it appears the growth may be shifting to a more costly portion of the business. Gross profit margin fell in Q1 2015. Gross margin hit 79% in Q1 2014, with full year 2014 finishing at a 77% margin, however in Q1 2015 the margin fell to 68%.Source: Teledoc S-1Investors may read the increasing costs as either issues growth or competition, regardless they are a significant factor to Teladoc's future profitability. The company has continued to post widening loses, from a $6 million net loss in 2013 to $17 million in 2014 to $12 million just in Q1 2015.Source: Teledoc S-1The company's IPO at $19 per share raised significant working capital for the company to continue to invest in operations and growth. The company is projected to have well in excess of $100 million in cash after the IPO in order to find growth initiatives.ValuationTeladoc's current share price of $27 represents a price-to-sales multiple of 20x. The current valuation represents a large premium over comparable peers. However, the valuation represents investor's confidence in the growth potential behind telemedicine.Source: Teledoc S-1The biggest risk for Teladoc is the telemedicine becomes a niche service to treat only low-acuity illnesses in rather healthy patients. More severe injuries requiring blood work, radiology, or actual treatment will continue to go to clinics and urgent cares. Also, doctors may opt to treat more chronically ill patients with face-to-face, hands on interactions. The model of treating patients electronically goes largely against physician training, who are taught hands-on medicine. Large scale adoption is highly uncertain, and is under threat from a variety of alternatives including retail clinics in stores and concierge-type medicine.SummaryTeladoc has plenty of potential. Early investors recognized the potential by driving up the company's valuation to almost $1 billion in market cap. Despite the company's early success and growth, it has continued to post widening loses and is under constant threat from a variety of alternative options. Investors looking to get on the bandwagon may want to wait a few months. Both the lookup period expiration and market correction will likely bring the valuation closer to the IPO price which looks like a better entry point."

(NYSE:TDOC) (""Teladoc"", ""TDOC"" or the ""Company"") with a ~12-month price target of ~$10 per share (utilizing bullish assumptions when valuing the business in line with peers and consensus sell-side estimates). While today Teladoc skirts membership of the infamous ""Tres Commas"" club, a combination of pricing pressure and litigation risk could ultimately value the equity below our ~$10 price target, squarely placing TDOC in the ""no comma"" club.Teladoc is a provider of telehealth solutions, connecting prospective patients with doctors by phone, webcam or mobile app (think Skype). TDOC is hired by health plans or employers who pay a small monthly fee, generally under 50 cents per month for each employee that signs up, which gives them access to a doctor by phone in exchange for $40 per ""visit"". These doctors are often limited to what they can treat, with the top items being diagnosed consisting of the flu, common colds, UTI and yeast infections. In return, the doctors receive $20-25 per visit. Basically, TDOC operates a call center that connects prospective patients to doctors.TDOC represents an attractive short opportunity and shares many similarities with other recent broken JOBS Act IPOs from 2013 and 2014 vintages. Notable similarities include valuations that can be associated with life-changing SaaS concepts, therefore trading at a high multiple of revenue. Further, the Company's prospectus and recent sell-side reports reference numerous popular buzzwords, in addition to pressing a massively overstated total addressable marketable. Contrary to the sell-side thesis, Teladoc operates an obsolete business model with over 13 years of negative cash and EBITDA generation, yet is currently misperceived as a high-growth technology company. TDOC is, at best, a low-margin call center facing a bleak future as the Company faces disintermediation by both clients and providers, pricing pressure, as well as potential bankruptcy risk, as it faces both patent and regulatory litigation.A prime example of a confusing ""office space"" like the image Teladoc placed in its prospectus to play off buzzwords. The Company forgot to add clean-tech to the image below. I blame the bankers.Source: Teladoc Prospectus/S-1AA short thesis in Teladoc is merited on account of the following attributes:Astronomic Valuation: Teladoc currently trades at a staggering ~17.5x LTM revenues, which is absurd considering the Company is expected to continue its 13-year track record of negative EBITDA and cash flow generation over the next three years. Teladoc has also acquired peers at ~3x-5x sales, which, in its own merits, is expensive, yet reflects the irrationality of TDOC's current multiple. Furthermore, the Company's inflated total addressable market in FY2020 is expected to reach ~$3 billion, according to IBISWorld. At the current price, Teladoc trades at ~30% of its implied market five years out. As history demonstrates, technology changes drastically, particularly in industries with low barriers to entry, hence Teladoc will likely not grow into its implied valuation.Per the Company's prospectus, Teladoc valued its common equity at under $9 per share, utilizing a DCF with management's lofty internal targets. Note that this is also above recent VC funding completed in November 2014.No Moat, Low-Barriers-to-Entry Industry with Undifferentiated Peers: The telemedicine industry has little barriers to entry as defined as having multiple competitors with no pricing power and low switching costs. For example, a new entrant would simply need to license technology, hire an outsourced call center and sign up doctors/providers in order to start its business. With over 15 comparable providers today, it won't be a surprise to see new participants enter the space or experience in-sourcing by payors/providers. Moreover, this is supported by the Company's lack of patents and low R&D spend over the past 13 years.Service is also undifferentiated amongst offerings from other telehealth providers or difference in outcomes versus office visits. At the end of the day, there is very little differentiation in the industry beyond wait times and care - for in-person offices have the clear advantage due to the ability to write any prescription needed. Most competitors also note quick response times.As demonstrated by the Company's consistently negative gross profit for visits, Teladoc has no pricing power, as with every additional visit, the Company experiences negative gross margins when excluding subscription access revenues. With no operating leverage (costs per visit are one for one), TDOC will face declining pricing and gross margins, particularly as competition continues to intensify.Threat of Disintermediation and Pricing Pressure: Due to the continued increase in healthcare costs, Teladoc faces a real risk of disintermediation, as providers and payors could easily forgo middlemen such as Teladoc in order to increase efficiency and maintain margins. Rolling out a similar business in-house would not be a daunting task, considering the low barriers to entry and lack of technology required as noted above. For instance, pricing pressure is likely to intensify, which does not bode well for the Company, given its negative gross margin visit business and high estimated gross margins on its subscription access revenues. Recall that Teladoc purchased peers which currently consist of over 35% of its current revenues. These contracts purchased include free visits per member versus the $40 per visit fee historically paid, hence the blend per visit fee ranging from $22 to $25. It is highly likely that the remaining business transitions into a similar fee structure, which would not only pressure subscription access margins, but would lead to larger gross profit losses on the visit segment.Teladoc faces two potential outcomes for its revenue model: (1) TDOC transitions into a pure-play subscription margin model, for which an increase of visits negatively impacts gross margins and intensifies losses; or (2) The Company is forced to adopt a per-visit fee only structure, similar to Doctor On Demand. We find this the most likely scenario, given that it is advantageous to both health plans and employers, as it's a low- to no-cost option. While subscription revenues won't magically disappear over one quarter, they likely will be pressured at every renewal. Recall, subscription access fees represent over 70% of TDOC's LTM revenues, hence the Company would have to right-size its cost structure drastically.*The above holds LTM expenses constant and assumes visits receive $40 versus ~$25 blended.We see this as the highest-probability outcome as Teladoc's venture capital backed competitors attempt to super-charge their member growth trajectory. This set-up and the VC thought process can be perfectly explained by the following clip:""Who is worth the most? Companies that lose money.""Aggressive Growth Promises and Over a Decade of Cash Burn: Teladoc would make Russ Hanneman proud, as the Company excels at losing money like no other. Over the past 13 years, it has not demonstrated the ability to generate positive cash flow or EBITDA, and negative results are expected to continue over the near term, with ~$45MM of cash burn expected in FY15E. While IBISWorld projects the telehealth industry to grow at a ~40% CAGR from FY15 to FY20 to a $3.1B TAM, TDOC is unlikely to participate, even assuming the lofty goals forecasted by IBISWorld and the sell side are accomplished. Competition and the dubious nature of the offering are among the main drivers and can be seen from other metrics, such as doctors signed on (only 675 over 13 years). Furthermore, TDOC has boosted growth through acquisitions.If Teladoc survives, at best it compared against other low-value/low-margin providers such as call centers with returns on invested capital below 10% and low-single digit EBTIDA margins.Ongoing Litigation Could Materially Impair the Business: Teladoc has a multi-year legal battle with the Texas Medical Board (""TMB""), which oversees TDOC's largest state in terms of members (2.4MM members and 20% of rev). In 2011, the TMB claimed TDOC's physicians were violating the law by prescribing medication to patients during telehealth visits. After a three-year legal battle, Teladoc received a favorable summary judgment and was awarded an injunction. TMB responded by revising the rules, such as requiring an in-person examination of a patient before being able to accept telehealth visits going forward. The TMB also added additional burdens on June 3, 2015 in an attempt to restrict TDOC. Once again, TDOC filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against the TMB and members under the Sherman Antitrust Act, stating they are attempting to restrict competition. While Teladoc may ultimately win the case, it will likely take 2-3 years before finalizing, and will require significant expenses on TDOC's front. Importantly, this isn't the first time TDOC has faced litigation or restrictions, having experienced these with states such as Idaho and Arkansas in the past.Note, TDOC also faces patent litigation from American Well, the largest telehealth provider with over 25 million members, which was founded in 2006.Lack of Disclosure and Mistakes Out the Gate: While not key to this thesis, disclosure is poor at TDOC. For instance, the Company is very vague around its relationship/structure with Teladoc PA, which is the variable interest entity which hires/contracts the doctors. Teladoc also does not reveal its membership churn (which, from piecing together press releases of acquired targets, is likely high). Furthermore, in its most recent 10Q, the Company mistakenly used the 1st quarter visit number of 148,696 for the 2nd quarter (the press release states the correct 2Q visits of 125,322). Albeit a small mistake, for a public company filing its first 10Q, this does not inspire confidence and leaves us wondering how solid its internal controls/accounting functionality is.Bull thesis - The consensus bull thesis has been predicated on the following data points:Strong Organic Member GrowthRebuttal: Bulls point to Teladoc's staggering membership growth over the past year as evidence of the growing acceptance and as an inflection point for the business. For instance, members supposedly grew from 6.2MM in 4Q13 to 8.1MM at the end of FY14, or ~30%. While TDOC does not provide color on members acquired, yet a simple Google search reveals that AmeriDoc, which was acquired by TDOC in 2Q14, had over 1.4MM members. It is highly likely AmeriDoc alone accounted for over 75% of members added for the year and organic member growth went negative for 2Q14.Moreover, this is not a one-time issue, as in the last quarter, another recent acquisition, StatDoc, added ~1MM members, while TDOC reported net adds of 900K, implying negative member growth of 100K.Large Total Addressable MarketRebuttal: Many assume TDOC's target addressable market is ~$11B-16B in the long term and $3.1B by 2020 (assuming 40-50% CAGR). The TAM numbers stated in analyst reports are more than aggressive, as they assume more than 25% of hospital and doctor visits convert to telephone/video, inclusive of ER visits. This is highly unlikely, given restrictions on treatment that can be provided on phone, as well as likely consumer hesitation. Furthermore, from a cost perspective, Teladoc is disadvantaged at $40 per visit, which compares unfavorably against doctor office visits/co-pays of $25-30, as well as low-cost pharmacy clinics provided by firms such as Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) and CVS Corp. (NYSE:CVS). Even assuming the $3.1B TAM is achieved by 2020, Teladoc today is trading for over 30% of the implied market, which is unreasonable considering the risk of in-sourcing and plentiful competition.Clear Cost Savings for the ConsumerRebuttal: While the argument for ease of use holds some merit, cost savings for the end-consumer is false, as the $40 cost of a Teladoc visit is more expensive than primary care ($24) and urgent care ($36), while it is cheaper than an ER visit ($124). Note, in certain cases, Teladoc visits are free for members in plans the Company acquired. These lines contracts tend to be unprofitable.Although not directly quantifiable, phone or webcam visits likely open up a higher probability for misdiagnosis as well as potential abuse (i.e., online visits to obtain medication).Value Proposition for DoctorsRebuttal: The Company pitches itself as a prime offering for doctors, due to the ability to earn $150 per hour versus ~$99 per hour running their own offices. This is flawed, as it would require the doctor to triage over 6 patients or an implied 10 minutes per visit versus an average visit of 14 minutes. Per industry sources, the average doctor would see 2-3 patients per hour, yet, under the TDOC model, they would have to see 4 at minimum in order to achieve comparable payment levels. Not only is this extra work, it leaves room for error and potential medical mistakes, and hence, the quality of care may actually decrease.Additionally, doctors are restricted to what they can treat by phone (top ten cases per TDOC are flu/cold/nasal congestion/UTI/yeast infection). It is perhaps safe to assume many doctors did not attend medical school in order to be able to just treat 5-10 common indications. Perhaps this is why Teladoc has only attracted 675 doctors over the past 13 years!Disruptive TechnologyRebuttal: Teladoc is not a disruptive tech company, nor is it even a ""Web 1.0"" business. It holds no patents, spends very little on research and development, and has over 50% of health consultations by phone. While the sell side compares TDOC to SaaS companies such as Veeva (NYSE:VEEV), a more reliable comparable set would include call-center businesses and BPO providers.Operating Leverage and Strong Visibility for Revenue GrowthRebuttal: Teladoc's business model exhibits little-to-no operating leverage, as demonstrated by the continual degradation of its margin profile. For instance, with each visit, the Company generates negative gross profits, implying that with every additional visit, TDOC will lose greater gross profit dollars. Most telling was the past quarter, for which revenues were up 77% year-over-year, while expenses were up a staggering 300%.Moreover, the business has no pricing power and cannot raise visit fees, given its positioning above primary care physicians as well as pressure on the healthcare system in entirety. The perceived first-mover advantage holds no merit, as TDOC is simply a call center with one year max duration contracts, which can be switched over to other providers with ease.Company OverviewFounded in 2002 and IPO'd in July 2015, Teladoc is among the top five telehealth companies by membership size. It contracts with employer health plan sponsors, managed care companies, and other payers to provide beneficiaries access to its on-demand network of providers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The Company deploys its multimodal technology (no patents) to connect patients with providers on demand. Teladoc can connect patients with providers either over a conventional telephone, through a smart device, or a PC. The Company's platform connects its more than 4,000 payer clients, representing almost 12 million beneficiaries, with its network of more than 1,100 board-certified physicians and behavioral health professionals, commonly treating ailments including sinusitis, allergies, and urinary tract infections. Teladoc's business model is straightforward, charging payers a per-member-per-month fee for access to the network ($4-5 per year), plus a fee for the provider visit ($40, or free for certain plans). TDOC's doctor network consists of nearly 700 doctors, who receive ~$25 per consultation (TDOC pays $25 to $30 to Teladoc PA, who pays a cut to the doctor).ValuationUsing consensus top line growth assumptions, Teladoc's intrinsic value in the best case is no more than ~$8 per share, relatively in line with the internal DCF the Company noted in its prospectus.Moreover, sales transactions have occurred anywhere from 2.0x to 5.0x revenues in the space. Applying the median of this transaction supports our DCF valuation.CatalystsThe following are potential catalysts which could lead to a realization of our target price:Pricing Pressure and Potential Loss of Subscription Access Fees: As mentioned above, competitors such as Doctor On Demand are aggressively offering plans which include no subscription access fees, just a flat $40 per visit. Recall, subscription access revenues equate to over 60% of TDOC revenues - hence, any pressure on this line, and Teladoc will likely be in a precarious position.Revenue or EPS Miss: While the last earnings call was TDOC's first as a public company, it managed to guide to higher EBITDA losses versus that which some on the street had expected. Furthermore, operating expenses are expected to increase over the next year.Litigation: While likely a low probability-event, if TDOC loses its case in Texas (~20% of revenues), additional states may follow.Loss of Clients: Teladoc's contracts come up for renewal once a year. Due to the churn mentioned above and lack of disclosure in its financials, the loss of clients may be already occurring.VC exit: Due to heightened competition, Teladoc's sponsors may prefer a quick exit versus a wait-and-see approach, particularly when considering VC funding was consummated at a price materially lower than what TDOC trades at today.Short Thesis RisksThe potential key risks to the short thesis are as follows:ConclusionTeladoc carries many of the key buzzwords used to promote stocks today, yet the disconnect between business quality and the rosy outlook painted is vast. Despite trading off from its peak of $34 per share, pricing pressure and member churn (hidden thus far by acquisitions) combined will serve as the catalysts to lead TDOC below its $19 IPO price, ultimately meeting a similar fate of another former favorite JOBS Act short, a business that also loses money like none other - SFX Entertainment (NASDAQ:SFXE)."

        Teladoc has pulled ahead of its competitors in size and reach.
        User engagement improved but remains low.
        Massive pipeline of growth opportunities, but shares trade at a high premium.","In July, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) became the first telehealth company to IPO in the US. The company provides on-demand healthcare via the Internet and is the first of its class to hit the exchanges.There's a lot to like about TDOC. Their technology is cheaper, faster, scalable, and has 2/3rds marketshare in a rapidly emerging market. Their IPO was a success, and they just reported a phenomenal second quarter.However, at today's prices I find it difficult to see a lot of near-term upside. The multiples are very high given guidance, and unless TDOC can improve patient usage, a cheaper price may present itself.Still, I believe telehealth will transform this sector. For those of you interested in telehealth, consider Teladoc.Teladoc in a NutshellTeladoc lets patients connect with a doctor without having to make an actual trip to the doctor's office. In essence, it gives patients on-demand access to a doctor over the Internet or phone.Aside from saving patients time and money, the service cuts waste and saves precious medical resources.As an example: One morning your child is not feeling well with an upset stomach and sore throat. You request a Teladoc and 20 minutes later you're speaking with a doctor over your computer. After describing your child's symptoms, the Doctor requests that you send a photo of the back of your child's throat to help the diagnosis. The Doctor then provides you instructions and/or writes your child a prescription if necessary.Of course, Teladoc cannot be used for all conditions. The service mostly targets acute illnesses such as:Ailments like these are extremely common. They're also simple to treat, but are disproportionately expensive.""It's a lot like Uber,"" says CEO Gorevic, adding that waitlists to become a Teladoc doctor have appeared in most states. ""Granted we were before Uber,"" he jokingly adds. Fortune 9/24/14.The technology has clear advantages. In fact, you'll wait longer for your doctor (inside his own office) than the average Teladoc.(Source: Form S-1; Teladoc Policy; NYT, Goodnough; Fortune)Q2 DeliveredQuarterly earnings are always important, but for a recent IPO they're absolutely critical.Despite high expectations, TDOC reported great numbers, and after hearing the CEO, my confidence has increased considerably.Q2 gist:Total revenue clocked at $18.3 million, which is a 78% increase compared with last year's second quarter. Membership grew 50% and the real-time enrollment has since exceeded 12 million members.In addition, the core business gained some big contracts including: Health New England, Prudential, Marsh & McLennan, Alcoa, and PNC.(Source: Q2 Transcript; Teladoc)The company incurred $15.3 million in EBITDA losses through G&A. This was expected, and much of the expenses were one-time events. There were no surprises.As for guidance, the third quarter is expecting $19 - $19.5 million and a loss in EBITDA of $11.5 - $12 million dollars. Patient visits for the quarter are projected to be between 115,000 and 125,000.Full year revenue guidance is expected to be $73 million to $75 million and EBITDA is expected to lose $50 - $52 million. Total visits are projected to be between 520,000 and 540,000.(Rock Health: Click To Enlarge)Expenses grew but the impact was small and temporary. A lawsuit in Texas accounted for $7 million in legal fees. Administrative costs grew by moving to a new corporate office and a massive hiring spree. Management expects earnings will break even in 2017, and the company is now flush with $183 million in cash from the IPO.But the real story isn't the numbers.Management's plan to expand into new clincal areas, services, AND user engagement were, by far, the major highlights of the call.TDOC's plan to expand their reach into behavior health, dermatology, and second opinions would grow their reach by millions of patients. The telehealth market's estimated to be ~$6B dollars via Goldman Sach's analyst David Roman. If psychiatric care's introduced, it will reach $12B dollars.And there's more.TDOC's technology may soon be used for remote patient healthcare. This includes patient monitoring, wellness recovery, and drug adherence. Patients avoid long, needless trips to the clinic, and physicians can hold patients more accountable during their recovery.Medication adherence is a major problem today. It would not surprise me to see Teladoc find its way into this space.User Engagement Is KeyLastly, Teladoc's user engagement showed signs of improvement in Q2. This is a huge development that deserves special attention.Teladoc has struggled with this in the past. While sales have grown rapidly, only a small percentage of patients (<4%) actually use the service. In this way, Teladoc's become highly leveraged. With 12 million customers, a minor increase in usage can send revenues soaring.Management's made this a top priority, and their efforts appear to be working. Visits have doubled since 2014 and patient awareness has grown considerably.User Engagement Growth (Source: RockHealth; Q2 Transcript)User engagement grew by emailing patients, and revamping their websites. Mobile also played a huge role. Almost 1/2 of Teladoc appointments are now on mobile devices and the IOS app has received encouraging reviews.For the record, this was CEO Gorevic's first CC to shareholders. I was very impressed with Mr. Gorevic; he was clear, candid, and brief. He has an acute understanding of the industry and the direction it's moving.Adding it all up, TDOC lived up to the hype, a rare feat for an IPO.Analysts Are SoldSince the quiet period ended, the IPO underwriters and their targets are now visible to the public.They include: J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank as joint book-running managers; and William Blair, Wells Fargo, and SunTrust Robinson as co-managers.Even though shares have leaped 50% since the IPO, the underwriters are unanimously bullish with an average price target at $38.00 dollars, ~27% higher than today's prices.Wells Fargo's gave shares of TDOC an Outperform rating for their dramatic cost advantage and convenience. The firm had this to say:Teladoc was priced with a generous 7x multiple based on 2017 sales projections of $174 million. This suggests Wells Fargo anticipates sales growth of 66% for the next several years.(Source: FlashRatings; NASDAQ; 24/7; Wallst)The Affordable Care Act TailwindWhy has telehealth taken so long to mature? Other sectors like media, print, cabs, and online shopping embraced similar tech years ago.Onerous and unclear laws are part of the problem.But Industry insiders say it was mainly a lack of incentives that kept doctors from using the technology. Because doctors bill by the number of in-person services they provide (fee for service) the demand for online consultations isn't there.The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has since turned this on in its head.Shahid Shah, CEO of Healthcare IT firm Netspective, explained in detail how the ACA accomplishes this.(Source: The Economist)Recent data from ""The Journal of American Medical Association"" estimates that approximately $734 billion dollars were wasted in 2014 due to needless services and structural inefficiencies.That's almost 27% of the entire sector!Costs include, but are not limited to: cancellations, unfilled time slots, administrative burden, business hour limits, geographic constraints, staff shortages, and millions of needless trips to the ER.(Source: Form S-1; Jen Wieczner Fortune; ATA; S. Shah; Reuters)Needless ER VisitsFrom the 8K, the US medical system receives 1.25 billion ambulatory visits each year. According to a recent NIH-funded study, a visit to the ER now costs on average $1,200 dollars, roughly 40% more than the average American's rent.Among the 8,000 sampled, some visits cost as high as $73,000 dollars for a common urinary infection!10 Most Frequent ER Conditions (Source: Nolan Caldwell, PLOS)Teladoc asserts that they can address a third of these ER visits. The bulk of these trips stem from the 62 million Americans that have inadequate access to care due to a lack of local physicians. Providing these individuals access could save billions.Goldman Sachs analyst, David Roman, believes this is a key selling point. His research claims patients could save $104 billion dollars a year using telehealth. The average American visits the doctor 3.32 times annually, or ~1.06 billion visits in total. Mr. Roman estimates that almost half of these trips (some 530M) did not require an in-person visit.(Source: Form S-1; Business Insider; Signature; Caldwell)Teladoc Needs Better Selling Not SalesSales numbers by themselves don't tell us the whole story. Returning to user engagement, I believe this will be the deciding factor for near-term success. Unlike sales, which are subscription based, usage rates show raw demand--or lack thereof.Like any new product, Teladoc must convince people to try it. This can be difficult, especially in healthcare.Habits die hard.TDOC Has Crossed The Chasm (Source: Crossing The Chasm, Moore; Q2CC)Reading between the lines, much of TDOC's sales growth has come from increasing prices on their customers. Their subscription sales are strong, but ultimately consumers have to start using the service. Q2's 125,000 visits are a start, but with 12 million patients that's unacceptable.Whether TDOC can convert their 12M patients in large numbers is still unclear.I believe most patients will migrate to telehealth... eventually. But the speed at which this happens is anyone's guess. Teladoc changes the way we communicate with our doctor entirely. Uber revolutionized cab service, but it did not alter the core transaction to this extent.IPO Snapshot:Most IPOs are expensive, and TDOC's no exception.TDOC shares first entered the NYSE at $19.00 valuing Teladoc at $680M respectively. The price jumped 50% out of the gate, and shares now trade at $28.40 making TDOC a $1.1B company, about 14x this year's projected sales.With the IPO officially closed, there are almost 9.5 million shares in circulation. However, the bulk of shares have yet to hit the market. The 26.3M remaining shares will be restricted for 180 days following July 1st, making TDOC's total outstanding share count 35,796,346.Most of TDOC's history is in the dark. We do that business has accelerated thanks to changes in healthcare. Last year, sales grew a whopping 119%. For the 2015 fiscal year, Rock Health's managing director, Malay Gandhi, forecasts $69-79M in sales-a respectable 57-87% YoY growth.Increased revenue per member (ARPM) has driven the bulk of sales (74%) suggesting the service is being received well. The company also quadrupled its membership to over 12M and grew revenue per member by $2 to now $5.37 per customer.Like most emerging companies, Teladoc is unprofitable and is sales focused. For the first half of 2015, they've lost $27.3M in net EBITDA from increased operating expenses.(Source: Form S-1; Teladoc)Any Other Concerns?Telehealth is a nebulous business that patients and lawyers are still adjusting to. The benefits are clear, but the law isn't.According to the HIS, much of the growth in telehealth is being driven by Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in Medicare and for the privately insured.But the jury is still out on what services will be provided and who is liable.Recently, TDOC pulled out of Arkansas and Idaho due to legal concerns. The company had this to say: ""The board of medicine took the position that our business model did not meet the state's applicable legal requirements in order for our physicians to prescribe medications,""But the CEO sees things differently.As for competition, TDOC leads by a wide margin, representing 2/3rds the market.The largest competitor is American Well. AW is a privately held telehealth company out of Boston that also links patients with doctors over video. They were founded in 2006 and operate out of 46 states. The cost of a visit is typically $49, but is covered by some insurance. Similar to Teladoc, after the visit the patient receives a secure message with the physician's notes and instructions for follow up care.(Source: Form S-1; AW; CC; John Grahams, Forbes; Mobi)Growing AcceptanceAccording to Towers Watson, as many as 71% of employers with more than 1,000 employees are expected to offer telehealth by 2017.(Source: Teladoc)Teladoc now serves over 4,000 employers including 160 in the Fortune 1000. They include Bank of America, Pepsi, and Shell.The company also operates as an intermediary with 20 health plans that include some of the largest providers in the country including: Aetna, Blue Shield of California, Highmark, and Centene. Per the S-1, management insists ""Telehealth is in the early states of what eventually become widespread adoption."" I agree.(Source: Form S-1; Bussiness Wire)Bottom LineIt's pretty rare that I take any interest with an IPO. This is due to my native distrust of insider trading, but also because IPOs are almost impossible to value.But there are exceptions to every rule, and Teladoc is one of them.Teladoc has a lot to be excited for. Healthcare trends are in its favor, the benefits are clear, and I believe consumers will eventually migrate over in mass. To top it off, their first-mover advantage and size leads the market.Teladoc is the only telehealth company investors can buy. But fortunate for us, it's also the best."

Founded in 2002, the company provides healthcare at any hour by phone, Internet, video and mobile devices.You can read more about TDOC in our prior articles here and here.Teladoc healthcare professionals are licensed in internal medicine, pediatrics, emergency medicine, family medicine, behavioral health and dermatology. These professionals must be credentialed every three years with NCQA-certified credentialing standards. They are primary care physicians, dermatologists, pediatricians, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and licensed therapists. Generally, most of these providers integrate telehealth or telemedicine into their primary medical practices.The Teladoc platform has approximately 11 million unique members. The cost per visit is $40, and the average wait time to connect with a healthcare professional is about 10 minutes. Also, 92 percent of Teladoc members have their medical issue resolved through the service. Teladoc doctors can diagnose, recommend treatment and prescribe medication if necessary.Teladoc offers these telehealth services on a subscription basis to large employers who then offer the service as an employee benefit. Approximately 90 percent of consultations take place over the phone and the service enjoys a 95 percent member satisfaction rate.(Source)In 2014, Teladoc reported ~$44 million in revenue, an increase of 119 percent over 2013. Membership increased 1.9 million to 8.1 million and annual per-member revenue increased to $5.37 from $2.16.Currently, Teladoc has over 1,600 direct and administrative services only (NASDAQ:ASO) clients including 160 Fortune 1000 companies, Shell, Pepsi, Bank of America, and Accenture. They also have health system clients such as Henry Ford, Memorial Hermann and Mount Sinai.Competition: Doctor on Demand, MDLive and Urgent Care ClinicsTeladoc faces competition from other providers of telehealth services such as Doctor on Demand, American Well and MDLive. In addition, the company faces competition from services such as urgent care clinics located within drug stores like the Minute Clinic in CVS pharmacies (NYSE:CVS).Early Market Performance: Solid StartTeladoc priced its IPO at $19 per share, well above its expected price range of $15 to $17. The stock opened on the first day of trading at $29.90 and closed at $28.50 for an increase of 50 percent. Since then the stock reached a high of $34.82 on August 4 and a low of $15.61 on November 6. Currently, the stock trades at $18.10 (12.21.2015).(Nasdaq.com)Conclusion: Sell/Short TDOC ahead of Dec. 28thAlthough TDOC has faced some stumbling blocks, including losing health insurer Highmark's contract, its post-IPO performance has been solid.In addition, company reported that membership grew by 56 percent and total doctor visits grew by 89 percent for the third quarter of 2015.Principal stockholders (see below) might take the opportunity to sell some or all of their holdings.(Source)Five PEs and ~13 individuals hold over triple the amount of shares currently trading. If even a portion of these insiders decides to sell, it could put significant pressure on TDOC's share price due to an oversupply on the market.Our firm has found abnormal negative returns of ~4% surrounding the event."
3810256,52382,2016-01-15T10:15:23-05:00,"Extreme pessimism due to valuation, but a good growth story driven by industry shifts and regulatory changes rather than economic trends.Spending high, but only to support growth and profitability is possible by the later half of this year.The strategic value of the platform is only increasing - acquisition premium may follow.","Teladoc Inc. (TDOC) stock is down almost 30% over the past six months and trading near the IPO price, but the company is a good growth story that seem to be going through the usual early cycle dynamics, which is rare to find outside of venture funded private businesses these days. The quarterly scrutiny of the public markets has heightened the volatility, but it is a good name for growth focused investors, especially as fundamentals suggest that most issues, including valuation, may get sorted out over the next few quarters.Source: Teladoc WebsiteValuation is by far the biggest concerns of the bears, partly because the ballooning operating expense structure is delaying profitability, offsetting the strong revenue growth. Indeed the employee count, for the last reported quarter, was up more than 200% over a year before. Occasionally, the risk to the company's PMPM (per month per member) revenue model is also questioned, but that seems mainly driven by the rise, in profile, of some high profile startups.But ignoring the positive macro environment and company specific catalysts in light of these issues may be a mistake. The tele-health solutions are benefiting from the broader acceptance of service by members and adoption by employers as well as providers alike, partly to control the fast growing healthcare costs. The solution is becoming more of a productivity improvement tool. The business offers an extremely high growth rate that is mostly organic and with high visibility, both a rarity in this environment, while enjoying a dominant market share. The high operating expense structure is discomforting, but seems to be mostly growth related and considering the low utilization rates, benefits may follow through for a while.Overall, a typical high growth story, where valuation, especially using historical financial metrics, will remain a concern, but the correction might be a good opportunity to enter the name, even though bears may be celebrating and pushing their 'end is near' thesis during that time.With hardly any publicly listed pure-play competitor, the relative valuation seems more of a guess work, but the key questions are whether the business can grow into the current expectations/stock price and if there are any catalysts that can advance the process? Looking at the high visibility in the model, expected price increases from the current quarter and an already ramped up headcount, the answer to both seems positive. More so, the business has the potential to become a 'cult name' as more customers use the service and understand the power of the platform.Strategic value, well and growingThere is a ton of data supporting the value of tele-health, be it the potential to take care of almost 1/3rd of the ambulatory care visits, clients saving an average of a thousand dollars per employee, when employees received care thorough Teladoc, or more than 90% of the clients using Teladoc resolving their issue completely. As covered in my recent notes on WellCare Health (WCG), Magellan Health (MGLN) and Health Insurance Innovations (HIIQ), there is an increased focus on the quality of care delivered (star ratings) and cost management (MBRs - Member Benefit Ratios), partly driven by changes brought by the ACA. At the same time provider shortages support the need for increasing productivity, which the tele-health services can help by increasing the accessibility of physicians.The company's market position is such that it makes anything good for tele-health great for Teladoc. A large number of startups, including some high profile names like MDLive and Doctor-On-Demand, in the space may have increased the noise, but considering the company's market share (60% in terms of the tele-health visits) or the relative size (four times the closest competitor), it is easy to dismiss the same.Amid strong growth catalysts, growth drivers improvingAs most revenue drivers would suggest, the growth argument is probably the easiest to make and least doubted by even the naysayers.What many other growth stories experience, the growth for the business seems to be reaching a 'viral stage'. Indeed, it took 10 years for the business to get the first 500,000 visits, twelve months for the next 500,000 and the business was doing 45-50,000 visits per month during the last quarter. Not just growth, but the quality of growth is equally good. Almost 90% of the membership growth is organic and by the start of the fourth quarter, the company had almost 85% visibility into 2016 revenues. The pipeline consists of a mix of 60% demand from health plans and 40% of employers.With 12-13 million members and half a million visits, room for secular growth is wide open. Going forward, growth should come from expansion of membership (both new and existing clients), adding new clinical specialties, penetrating new markets and increasing engagement of members, but above all, the scale might be one of the biggest growth engines.Growing membership should bring more providers into the network, which in turn may support the growth of new membership. The company can always prioritize the physicians of new providers in the network, who would have joined with their own members.Adding new clinical specialties also plays right into this. The revenues from behavioral health, which represented almost 7% in 2015, are expected to double this year. New providers in the Teladoc network were up 76% sequentially in the third quarter, underneath which, the new physicians grew 19% and behavioral health specialists grew almost 126%Partnerships like the one with CVS Health Corp., which should introduce new consumer demand and volume to the company, are speaking volumes of the broader market trend and expected increase of visit fees by 12.5% from this quarter, which is expected to affect 75% of the clients throughout 2016, highlights the pricing power.Can high valuation and losses be cured? YesThe valuation is probably the most difficult part of the thesis. Even though financially comfortable with approximately $150 million of cash, the company is making losses, burning cash and the operating model has yet to show significant leverage.Even a quick back of an envelope type calculation would highlight the steep revenue growth required to deliver profitability, i.e. if the operating expenses stabilize around current levels. But if the current sequential growth rate of approximately 10% maintains, the profitability can be achieved by late this year.But developments like price increases and cost controls can definitely speed up the process. There are reasons to believe that the business can deliver on the expected leverage as the operating expense increase was driven primarily by an increase in employee-related expenses, partly due to significant growth in headcount. Secondly, the platform is scalable enough to handle 5-7 times the number of visits and members that the business is handling today.On Monday, the company pre-announced positively and dissecting the expected numbers suggest the numbers may have to move significantly higher from the current levels. Besides profitability, an acquisition is another exit option that is on the table, considering the dominant market share enjoyed the company in a growing segment of healthcare.Note: Detailed proprietary model is not attached in this note for the sake of easy readability, but happy to help and provide more details to readers interested in understanding the calculations used in this note.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3301865,25120,2015-07-04T16:44:29-04:00,"Teladoc is a leading telehealth platform and is showing rapid growth.The company's solutions provide benefits for caregivers and consumers, through a transformative business model.Given the benefits of the solutions and the size of the potential market, much more potential might be ahead.While the opportunities are huge, the current $1 billion valuation is rather high in relation to the revenue base, which makes this a risky bet.","Teladoc's (TDOC) initial public offering has been a huge success. Shares of the telehealth platform ended their first day of trading with large gains. Investors are attracted to the company thanks to the very quick pace of growth and large potential market opportunity.I do like the business and its solutions, the rapid pace of growth and the potential going forwards. That said, the excessive momentum has pushed up the valuation to roughly $1 billion at a time when the revenue base is still very small and losses are increasing.This makes the company very risky in the short term if growth does not materialize as anticipated. That said, the opportunity is still very large and if the company becomes a dominant player, shares could still become a multi-bagger many years down the road.The BusinessTeladoc describes itself as a telehealth platform which means that it provides healthcare at anytime through mobiles, video and the internet.The company connects over a 1,000 certified physicians and behavioral health professionals with customers who are dealing with acute health related issues. The company has 11 million potential customers as a client. These customers used the company's services for some 300,000 visits in the year of 2014. Besides a fixed subscription fee, consumer pays a flat fee of $40 per visit.Teladoc acts as the middle man in a business which creates benefits for patients as well as care givers. Patients only pay when they access healthcare and these solutions come at a relative cheap price versus alternatives. Patients further have the benefit that they can have access to healthcare 24/7. Caregivers have the chance to earn a considerable sum while not having to deal with fixed clients lists and the administration.The lack of an efficient healthcare system creates huge inefficiencies with many consumers not being qualified for healthcare. The lack of access to a doctor in the early stage of a health issue drives up the demand for ER visits, at an overall higher cost for the system.Teladoc cites a report of the CDC in its S1-Filing which states that the US healthcare system deals with 1.25 billion ambulatory care visits each year. The company estimates that it could potentially serve a third of these visits with its solutions. As a matter of fact the solutions are in such great demand that Fortune called TDOC the ""Uber of healthcare.""At the moment, Teladoc provides solutions to 11 million members, mostly through some 4,000 employer and prominent health care plans. This includes big names including Aetna, Blue Shield and Centene. Given the importance of scale, Teladoc focuses on the B2B segment rather than focusing on the direct-to-consumer segment.The OfferingTeladoc eventually sold 8.3 million shares for $19 apiece, thereby raising $158 million in gross proceeds from the offering. The demand for the offering was strong as the company initially aimed to sell just 7 million shares in a $15-$17 range.Following the share sale Teladoc will have roughly 37.1 million shares outstanding. These shares did see a big boost on their opening trading day and currently trade at around $28 per share. At these levels Teladoc is valued at $1.04 billion.Despite Rapid Growth, Revenue Base Still Rather SmallTeladoc has seen very strong growth in recent times. Revenues for the year of 2014 rose by 118.7% to $43.5 million. These growth trends are very encouraging, unfortunately losses have expanded at a rapid rate as well. Operating losses increased from $5.9 million to $15.1 million in the past year.By the end of 2014, Teladoc covered 8 million members who made nearly 300,000 visits. Note that the company charges both fixed and variable fees with the latter coming at $40 per visit. Of course most of these particular revenues go to the caregivers. Teladoc stated that roughly 85% of 2014's revenues came from subscriptions and the rest from its share of the visits.This information implies that fixed subscription revenues come in at $37 million per year, equivalent to $4-$5 per user based on the size of the client base at the end of the year. The revenues from visits came in at $6.5 million, equivalent to roughly $20 per visit.Growth trends continue to be strong in the first quarter of this year, although the pace of growth has slowed down a bit. First quarter sales rose by little over 75% on an annual basis to $16.5 million. The operating losses expanded from $2.2 million to $12.6 million as the general and administrative cost base rose sharply ahead of the IPO. An extrapolation of the first quarter revenues would imply that revenues now run at a rate of $66 million per year although they will undoubtedly come in higher than that in 2015.The $1.04 billion equity valuation includes some cash holdings. On top of the $158 million being raised in the IPO, Teladoc already held $18 million in cash. This means that operating assets are valued at around $900 million, equivalent to 13-14 times annualized revenues.Risks To The Business And ValuationGiven that Teladoc's business model is rather new, there are of course many risks despite the benefits for all of the parties involved. Existing regulation, which often prevents cross coverage between states, can create real challenges for the company.On top of these existing problems, the overall healthcare system is changing rapidly and the final future outcome and implications are still unknown. This uncertainty relates of course to Obamacare.Some good news is that customer concentration is not really an issue, while many growth companies often rely on a few large clients. The top 10 customer base combined generates a little less than 30% of total sales.The rapid change in technology, as well as risks related to litigation in case of mistreatment, are other concerns. Of course the company has limited liability insurance, although claims might exceed the coverage in some instances.As with many IPOs the biggest concerns is simply the valuation. While Teladoc is certainly a very promising business with real solutions and quick growth, a billion dollar valuation is quite sizable. To justify this valuation the company will need to see quick growth for a long period of time while margins should show some improvement in the future.Judging The PotentialAt the moment Teladoc already covers 11 million people. Based on the first quarter results, roughly one out of 20 users has made a ¨visit¨ on an annualized basis. This usage rate is still very low given that CDC figures learn that there are roughly 1.2 billion ambulatory visits made each year within the US, an average of 3-4 per person.If the company could become a major success and eventually grow to cover 100 million consumers in the US, the fixed revenue base could increase to roughly $500 million. If these users would use Teladoc's services just 0.5 times per year, the 50 million visits could bring in another $1 billion in revenues.Unfortunately these revenues streams are much less attractive for the business as they are likely to carry lower margins compared to the fixed fees. If Teladoc could deliver on this rosy scenario by let's say 2025, revenues could grow to $1.5 billion. If operating margins of 20% would be achievable, operating profits could come in at $300 million per year. After applying statutory tax rates and a 20 times earnings multiple, the business could be worth $4 billion at such a point in time.This means that investors could potentially four-fold their investment in the coming decade, translating into potential returns of roughly 15% per year.While I do not claim that this will happen, or even is likely to happen, such a case illustrates the potential of the business. This is important to realize as the current valuation of a billion seems ridiculously expensive for a very small business which is reporting large losses.Final ThoughtsTeladoc has a very promising business model and it is showing a lot of growth. While the current end user base is pretty substantial already, there is still plenty of room for more user growth. Another key driver for potential future revenue growth is simply the increased usage by existing customers.For now the business is not yet profitable, as a matter of fact margins are only getting worse. Given the need to be a leader, I am not that worried about this trend, certainly as the IPO proceeds will bring much relief to the business from a financial point of view.The greater concern is the valuation after the company has become a billion dollar company. While the company has the potential to become a dominant player in a niche field in the coming decades, chances are most likely greater that something will go wrong along the way. Given these probabilities, shares might look attractive as a potential short opportunity. Yet I am not willing to short this company as very strong future growth could still produce a $5 or $10 billion company in the coming decade, if Teladoc manages to become a huge player.Given the many uncertainties for either the bull and bear case I am deciding to have a neutral stance on the shares at the current moment. I must say that the business and its growth trajectory look very appealing. For this reason I will closely watch the business going forwards as I remain on the sidelines at the current moment."
3292465,75175,2015-07-01T01:37:26-04:00,"Teladoc offers a needed service that will only become more important as the U.S. faces a primary care shortage.The company's revenue and visit growth is accelerating, while its operating expenses have also risen significantly.If TDOC can control its general and administrative costs, there is large upside potential for early investors.","With reasonable certainty, businesses and investors can now expect the Affordable Care Act (aka, Obamacare) to remain law. Among other things, this means there will be a continued emphasis on preventative care strategies to help lower the rates of larger procedures and chronic illnesses.Against this well-timed backdrop, telemedicine provider Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) is set to start trading publicly this week. The company specializes in facilitating virtual appointments with physicians, usually done as a video conference through a computer or mobile device. The company is offering seven million shares priced in the $15-17 range.IndustryTeladoc charges $40 per appointment and positions itself as an alternative to expensive primary care appointments or emergency room visits for non-threatening conditions. This is a particularly relevant service, as the United States is facing a shortage of general practitioners, and emergency rooms have become the fallback plan for people without access to general care. There are numerous reasons for the lack of primary care physicians, but the most obvious is monetary - medical school tuition has continued to rise, while primary care salaries have remained stagnant. Now, just 30% of U.S. doctors practice primary care. By 2025, it's estimated there will be a shortage of 52,000 such physicians. At the same time, millions of additional Americans are being formally added into the health system.All of this is to say that Teladoc offers a needed service that will only become more important over the next decade. Virtual appointments offer convenient access to physicians for rural and poor areas, are typically faster than in-person appointments, and are significant cheaper. They also allows physicians to see more patients per day and facilitate the type of preventative care that will be essential to making nationwide healthcare work. While there are clear limitations on what Teladoc can offer - some conditions and symptoms need to be diagnosed in-person - most preventative appointments can be conducted through video. By Teladoc's own estimates (which, of course, should be taken as a best-case example), one-third of the 1.25 billion ambulatory care visits each year could be handled through telemedicine.FinancialsTeladoc's revenue growth and visit metrics back up the growing demand for virtual health services. The company's revenue increased 118% to $43.5 million last year, and it brought in $16.5 million during the first three months of 2015. In terms of visits, the company facilitated 298,833 appointments in 2014, up from 127,107 year-over-year. During the first three months of this year, Teladoc actually facilitated more visits (148,696) than it did throughout 2013. That's exactly the type of growth that will help it justify increasing operating costs.Speaking of costs, Teladoc's filing shows a significant increase in operating expenses during the first three months of 2015. Its loss from operations during the period was $12.6 million. In the same period of 2014, the company lost just $2.2 million. Most of this is due to a 357% year-over-year increase in general and administrative costs. Its advertising and marketing costs also rose to $4.3 million from $2.5 million, and the technology and development expense more than doubled, from $1.2 million to $2.9 million.This is one of the main downsides in what is otherwise a very promising IPO. As Teladoc is in the midst of expanding into more areas, a large portion of these costs are likely tied to infrastructure. Once its platform has been set up and doctors have been signed on in new areas, G&A costs should fall. I expect marketing and technology costs will continue to grow however as the company positions itself as a go-to health platform. Many people are still unfamiliar with the concept of telemedicine and will need to become comfortable with the idea before using it. Teladoc's contracts with a number of major employers (including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS)) should help in this regard.ConclusionTeladoc offers investors a promising platform in an expanding industry. The company's revenue and visit growth is accelerating, indicating that its recent expansion efforts are paying off. The steep rise in operating expenses is something that investors should watch closely, but as long as the company can rein in its general expenses following its build-out, Teladoc offers significant upside."

TDOC completed approximately 300,000 telehealth visits in 2014.The Teladoc solution is transforming the access, cost and quality dynamics of healthcare delivery for all of TDOC's market participants.Members rely on Teladoc to remotely access affordable, on-demand healthcare whenever and wherever they choose.TDOC's clients purchase the company's solution to reduce their healthcare spending, while at the same time offer convenient, affordable, high-quality healthcare to their employees or beneficiaries.TDOC's providers have the ability to generate meaningful income and deliver their services more efficiently with no administrative burden.Satisfaction rate 95%, 104% net dollar retention TDOC believes the value proposition of its solution is evidenced by its overall member satisfaction rate, which has exceeded 95% over the last six years, and a 104% annual net dollar retention rate among TDOC's clients on average over the last three years.The company further believes any consumer, employer or health plan or healthcare professional interested in a better approach to healthcare is a potential Teladoc member, client or provider.Market According to the CDC, there are approximately 1.25 billion ambulatory care visits in the United States per year, including those at primary care offices, hospital emergency rooms, outpatient clinics and other settings.TDOC estimates that 417 million, or 33%, of these visits could be treated through telehealth. TDOC believes that the total addressable market for telehealth in the United States consists of the ambulatory care telehealth opportunity - a subset of visits currently delivered in urgent and retail care settings and care foregone by those currently not accessing the healthcare delivery system.Acquisitions TDOC has scaled, and intends to continue to scale, its platform through the pursuit of selective acquisitions.In August 2013, the company acquired Consult A Doctor for $16.6 million, net of cash acquired.In May 2014, it acquired AmeriDoc for $17.2 million, net of cash acquired.Both of these acquired businesses specialized in providing telehealth solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses through broker distribution channels. These acquisitions added new distribution opportunities that TDOC believes are an important element of the growth strategy.In January 2015, TDOC completed the acquisition of BetterHelp, a provider of direct-to-consumer, behavioral health services, for $3.5 million in cash and a $1.0 million promissory note, and agreed to make annual payments to the sellers equal to 15% of the total net revenue generated by the BetterHelp business for each of the next three years.On June 17, 2015, the company closed the acquisition of StatDoc for aggregate consideration of $30.5 million, comprised of $13.3 million of cash and $17.2 million of TDOC common stock (or 1,051,038 shares).StatDoc is a telemedicine provider focused on managed care, health systems and self-insured clients.Regulatory risks Some states (Texas, Arkansas, Idaho) take the position that prescriptions need personal interaction. TDOC is apparently making progress in Texas and Idaho. For more information, see page 20 of the SEC filing.Intellectual property TDOC owns and uses trademarks and service marks on or in connection with its services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in the United States. The company also has trademark applications pending to register marks in the United States. In addition, TDOC relies on certain intellectual property rights that it licenses from third-parties and on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary processes and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of its products and technologies.Legal Risk On June 8, 2015, American Well Corporation filed a complaint against the company in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that certain of TDOC's operating platform's technology infringes one of its patents that TDOC is currently seeking to invalidate pursuant to an inter partes review that TDOC filed with the Patent Trial and Appeals Board in March 2015.Competition TDOC views as its competitors those companies that currently (or in the future) will (i) develop and market telehealth technology (devices and systems); or (ii) provide telehealth, such as the delivery of on-demand access to healthcare.In the provision of telehealth, competition focuses on, among other factors, experience in operation, customer service, quality of technology and know-how and reputation.TDOC's key competitors in the telehealth market are Doctor On Demand, MDLIVE and American Well.5% shareholders pre-IPODividends No dividends are planned.Use of proceeds TDOC expects to receive $100 million from its IPO and use it for:Disclaimer: This TDOC IPO report is based on a reading and analysis of TDOC's S-1 filing, which can be found here, and a separate, independent analysis by IPOdesktop.com.

3290995,90385,2015-06-29T12:04:09-04:00,"Teladoc (TDOC) is Uber for healthcare services delivering health services at a fraction of the cost of traditional hospital enrolment ($40/visit).
        The platform currently has an enrollment of 1,100 physicians and 11 million unique members.
        Customer satisfaction of 95% and annual net dollar retention rate of 104% strongly indicates revenue visibility and certainty of cash flows.
        With Obamacare set to kick-off full scale by 2016, Teladoc will be a major beneficiary as employers look for cheaper options for reducing their insurance bills, providing benefits to all.
        The company is offering 7 Million shares at a valuation of $580 million (mid-point price range of around $16/Share). JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are the lead underwriters.","All the information presented in this report is taken from the S-1 filed by the company with SEC.Business:Teladoc (Pending:TDOC) is a telehealth platform delivering on demand healthcare, via phone, internet and video at a cost of $40/visit (Compared to $145/physician visit or $1957/ER visit). The company can be termed to be a sophisticated Uber for healthcare services, connecting doctors to patients at everyone's convenience. The company claims to have an overall member satisfaction rate of 95% with an average median response time of less than 10 minutes.The company currently has a network of more than 1,100 certified physicians and 11 million unique members. Most of the members are acquired through a network of over 4,000 employers, health systems and plans including 160 of Fortune 1000 companies. The company expects the telehealth penetration amongst employers' health plan to reach 70% by 2017.Industry:With the kick start of Obama care, healthcare industry has seen as massive regulatory shift from 2012. Hospitals and doctors are getting overcrowded and lot of patients especially those with Medicaid are getting treated very late. In addition to these delays, employers' insurance costs started soaring with mandatory healthcare benefits being enforced. Teladoc addresses both these problems with its affordable and convenient delivery mechanism. The company is poised to benefit the most once Obamacare kicks off in full scale from 2016.Convenient, productive and lucrative service to Doctors:The doctors on platform earn at an average rate of $150/hour compared to average full time physician hourly wage of $99/hour. In addition to the higher income the platform provides work flexibility, increases the productivity of doctors and reduces the redundant administrative work. This makes it lucrative for the providers to enroll and continue providing their services through Teladoc platformSignificant economic savings to employers' insurance costs:At $40/Teladoc visit (Compared to $145/physician visit or $1957/ER visit), the platform offers substantial savings to the employers' insurance costs. In addition to these savings it allows the employers to improve their employee's productivity by reducing the waiting time for the usual appointments.Scalability:The company estimates that approximately 417 million, or 33%, of 1.25 billion annual ambulatory care visits in US could be treated through telehealth. The company has completed 300,000 health visits in 2014. Even if the company captures a mere 1% of this 417 million visits, revenue is expected to soar 14 times.· The platform in the current stage can support upwards of 10,000 visits per day versus the current rate of approximately 1,500 visits without any significant addition of resources.· The company is increasing the services offered on the platform to include behavioral health, dermatology and other services that will increase the top-line from additional services in addition to increased enrollment.The company's technology platform, existing network of physicians, health plan providers and the existing distribution channels gives it advantage over competition or new entrants to capture a decent share of the growing telehealth market without incurring significant resources.Financials: The company has reported $43.5 million revenues in 2014 (+116% Y-oY), while gross profits have grown at 114% Y-o-Y to reach $33.6 million in 2014. Net loss widened to $17 million (+183% Y-o-Y). The primary reason for widening of net losses is the investment in platform, heavy sales & marketing expenses. The company has almost tripled its work force since 2014. Extrapolating the three months results to full year of 2015, I expect the company to report $70 - $80 Million in net revenues and $40 - $50 Million in net loss.As the platform scales up, the operating expenses pretty much remain stagnant and the revenues will increase resulting in an overall positive effective on bottom line. The company is in its peak growth stage and I expect it to expend more on customer acquisition costs till the end of 2016. I expect them to report a profit in 2017/2018 with revenues growing to $500 - $600 Million in the next 4-5 years.Competition:While Teladoc is the oldest and largest player in the telehealth space, it has competition from an equally large player American Well (The company has in fact sued Teladoc for patent infringement on platform's technology backend system) and a handful of small players such as Doctorondemand, Mevisit etc. Teladoc's scale, resources and network gives it a huge advantage over other small players, while it competes with American well over price (American Well charges $49/visit compared to $40/visit of Teladoc). The telehealth market poised to expand significantly in the years to come has room for more companies and I expect the competition to only help the incumbent players to innovate and expand the horizon of services (Similar to what happened in the smart phone industry).Valuation:The company's business model is similar to Uber/Net Flix and it is fair to value it based on the revenue multiples as the business at the current stage is expected to have same growth levels. At 10X revenue multiple the business could be currently valued at $750 Million ($21/share). As the company demonstrates its success in the coming quarters or years to come there are a lot of favorable catalysts going forward.With significant savings to the employers, I expect the enrollment to grow multifold in the years to come. The company has a brand recognition and excellent growth profile. Wall Street has favorably rewarded such IPOs. Shake Shack, FitBit, David's Tea and GoPro are example of IPOs that are favorable rewarded by investors."

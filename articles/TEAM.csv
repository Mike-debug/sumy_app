4378547,20715,2020-10-11T23:40:37-04:00,Atlassian is hovering near an all-time high ahead of its fiscal first-quarter earnings report.The company has seen earnings and revenue grow at impressive rates in the last few years.Sentiment toward the stock is nowhere near as bullish as it should be.,"Application software firm Atlassian (TEAM) has performed extremely well over the last few years. The stock is up almost 145% over the last two years, while the S&P 500 is up a far more modest 21%. Even when compared to the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV), Atlassian has gained twice as much as the sector.Atlassian is getting ready to report fiscal first-quarter results in the next few weeks, and the stock is trading near an all-time high ahead of that earnings report. I wasn’t able to find the exact earnings date, as the company didn’t have the event on its Investor Relations page just yet. Several websites, including the Wall Street Journal, have the earnings report coming out on October 15. Based on the fact that Q4 2020 results were released on July 30 and third-quarter results were released on April 30, I am thinking the report will be in a few weeks, not on the 15th.Regardless of when the report comes out, analysts expect the company to report EPS of $0.27 for the quarter, and that is a penny shy of the $0.28 Atlassian reported in Q1 last year. Revenue is expected to come in at $$440.49 million, and that is an increase of 25.2% compared to last year.Over the last three years, the company has seen earnings grow by 52% per year, while revenue has grown by 38% per year. The fourth-quarter results showed earnings growth of 25% and revenue growth of 29%. Analysts expect the earnings growth to slow down in 2021 with an estimated growth rate of 3%. Revenue is expected to grow by 18.8%.In addition to the tremendous earnings and revenue growth, Atlassian has strong management efficiency measurements. The return on equity is extremely high at 50.6%, and the profit margin is above average at 23.6%.This is not my first article about Atlassian. I also wrote the company as part of pair’s trade idea with Slack Technologies (WORK) on April 3. I suggested that investors should buy Atlassian and short Slack. I felt the fundamentals for Atlassian were so much better than Slack’s that it would outperform - whether the market continued lower or if it continued to bounce back. The path for the overall market wasn’t really clear in early April. Since that article, Atlassian has moved up 46.6% and Slack is up approximately 26.5%.In addition to writing about Atlassian, I also recommended the stock to Hedged Alpha subscribers on November 11, 2019. I suggested that subscribers should take profits on the first half on February 11, 2020 for a gain of 23%. The second half is now sitting at a gain of approximately 63%. The stock closed at $198.85 on Friday, and it is trying to bust through the $200 level for the third time in the last few months.The blue arrow on the chart is when I recommended the stock. The drop in March almost hit the suggested stop-loss level I suggested, but thankfully, it never quite got there.The stock experienced two small dips in the third quarter, and that helped move the overbought/oversold indicators out of overbought territory. The quick selloffs weren’t enough to move the stock in to oversold territory, and now they have been climbing again for the last few weeks.In addition to the article in April, I wrote about Atlassian last October when the company was getting ready to report earnings. Looking back at that article, I found that the sentiment has shifted a little, but it still isn’t extremely bullish. Analysts have made the biggest shift, with 25 covering the stock, 18 with “Buy” ratings and seven with “Hold” ratings. This gives us a buy percentage of 72%. Last year, there were 22 analysts covering the stock, and these were evenly split between Buy ratings and Hold ratings.The short interest ratio is currently at 6.09 and has been rising in the last few months. It was as low as 3.58 at the end of June, but a combination of the short interest increasing and the average trading volume falling has caused the ratio to jump. Looking back at last year, the short interest ratio was at 5.62. The average short interest ratio is around 3.0, so for Atlassian, the ratio has been higher than the average stock for the past year. A high short interest ratio is a sign of pessimism or skepticism. From a contrarian viewpoint, that is a good thing.Turning our attention to the options market, there are 58,457 puts open and 54,019 calls open at this time. This gives us a put/call ratio of 1.08. That is right in the average range and reflects a somewhat neutral status for option traders. The ratio was a little lower last October at 0.995. The overall open interest is considerably higher than it was last year, and that suggests that Atlassian is getting more attention from option traders than it was a year ago.Obviously, I am still bullish on Atlassian, otherwise it wouldn’t still be in the model portfolio for The Hedged Alpha Strategy. The company’s fundamental ratings are really good with strong earnings and revenue growth, a great ROE, and an above-average profit margin. With more and more people working remotely, Atlassian’s connectivity software should remain in high demand.The technical picture for the stock shows that it is still in an upward trend, but it needs to break through the round-number resistance at $200. It attempted to break above that price level in early July and again in early September. If it breaks through this time, we could see a slight acceleration in the rally.I like the fact that the stock isn’t in overbought territory based on the weekly oscillators, but even when they have been in the past, it hasn’t necessarily been a bad sign for the stock. I just feel like it presents a better chance for a spike higher when a stock enters an earnings report and isn’t already overbought.The sentiment toward Atlassian is still far less optimistic than it should be, at least in my opinion. The high short interest ratio could help fuel a rally if the earnings exceed expectations. As short-sellers are forced to close their positions, it adds buying pressure to a stock that is already rallying.As for the earnings report itself, Atlassian has beaten earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, and the average beat has been by approximately 23%. I wouldn’t be surprised if the company beats the EPS estimate again, and that would mean it grew earnings instead of the slight decline that is expected."
4378308,102101,2020-10-09T06:25:30-04:00,"Atlassian is improving its capabilities in the ITSM space.Its strong momentum with enterprises of all sizes has propelled its growth in recent quarters.Investors will also find its solid cash flows and laser focus on its long-term strategy appealing.The stock has been resilient despite macro headwinds. This suggests investors are in this for the long term.With a strong momentum factor, long-term growth investors will find Atlassian attractive.","Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM) offers solid growth and cash flow features for investors seeking yield in the cloud space. The market has impressively digested headwinds to revenue growth induced by its shift to cloud subscriptions and churn from COVID-impacted verticals. Atlassian is also evolving new capabilities to strengthen its positioning in the ITSM space. These capabilities will drive sustainable near-term growth by entrenching Atlassian at the center of the evolving market for workplace collaboration tools. Its strength with large enterprises points to its ability to grow market share. Given its potential to keep improving margins, I believe Atlassian will continue to be appealing to long-term growth investors.Heading into the earnings season, I expect Atlassian to continue to benefit from the adoption of IT work tools that play into a lot of favorable tech trends. The market has been swift to digest the headwinds from customers' migration to Atlassian’s cloud offerings. The migration is expected to impact maintenance revenue, and the headwind is expected to be more pronounced in FY'21. COVID-19-related customer churn has also been a cause for concern. Growth investors will easily see through the temporary headwinds to revenue given Atlassian's strong narrative about its long-term vision. This narrative is also backed by its improved financials and growing product adoption across enterprises of all sizes. Going forward, I expect Atlassian to continue to outperform. This will ensure it beats its next quarter revenue guidance of $430m-$445m, which is within analysts' consensus.Atlassian is strengthening its capabilities in the IT service management space. Its acquisition-driven growth highlights its drive to cover most of the required collaboration use cases for IT teams. This is supported by its marketplace, which serves as a cheap incubator for new acquisition targets. The recent acquisition of Mindville makes Atlassian a strong player in the ITOps space. Mindville brings asset management capabilities and will potentially make Atlassian a good collaborator with DevOps and security platforms managing cloud assets. Atlassian also recently added Halp for better integration with Slack (TEAM). Besides the impact of its acquisitions to its R&D expense bucket, Atlassian's focus on growing its cloud solutions will explain the bulk of the changes to its financials.From the top line, the shorter billings duration of cloud subscriptions will be a temporary headwind to maintenance revenue. Cloud hosting cost also poses a headwind to gross margin expansion. This adds to the muted pricing increase to help large enterprises to accelerate their adoption of Atlassian's cloud offerings. Product adoption has been designed to be as touchless as possible; regardless, headcount growth is also expected to drive SG&A expenses as Atlassian drives to grow market share. Despite these anticipated expense growth, the forward non-GAAP EPS guidance ( non-IFRS EPS $0.26-$0.27 ) is impressive. I reckon the guide might be benefiting from travel-related cost savings until the effect of new investments is felt in 2H'21.Atlassian's ability to manage its working capital to support customers hit by the COVID crisis has been impressive. Its double-digit FCF margin has benefited from its success with large enterprises and its old licensing revenue recognition model. Going forward, headwinds to billings and its shift to cloud subscription will impact its FCF margin. This isn't a cause for concern given its improved non-GAAP operating margin, which ensures earnings remain a net positive contributor to operating cash flow.Competitive pressure also remains tempered. Atlassian is pushing to strengthen its competitive positioning to sit at the heart of the growing adoption of cloud-based IT work tools. Atlassian's tools have been designed to be intuitive and easy to use by technical and non-technical knowledge workers. This appears to be a competitive advantage, as this strategy drives sufficient workplace advocates. This is further supported by its smooth integrations with collaboration platforms like Slack. Going forward, I expect Atlassian to win with this strategy.Atlassian's growth factor has been strong in recent quarters. The market appears to have a solid understanding of the long-term strategy. This will drive minimal volatility if earnings are in line. A primary headwind to billings remains its exposure to small businesses. This has been partially managed with flexible payment terms and the monthly subscription option from its cloud solution. Given its improving margins, Atlassian will continue to outperform. Short-term investors might not find Atlassian appealing as it trades close to analysts' average price target of $201. This target assumes revenue growth of 19% in 2021, accelerating to 22% in 2022. I reckon the guidance has factored in the growing shift to cloud subscriptions. I expect further multiples dilution from its compelling growth factor heading into CY'21. The low-interest-rate environment continues to be supportive of the risk premium of tech stocks. As investors search for yield, I expect them to improve their risk appetite for growth stocks with good EPS or FCF factors.Atlassian's P/S of 26x means it is valued for sustainable, long-term growth, and the market also expects margins to expand. If this story doesn't play out, its valuation might be rerated.Atlassian expects more revenue to be derived from its cloud offerings. The migration of customers to its cloud offerings might impact EPS growth in the short term.If COVID-related headwinds don't subside, Atlassian's ability to defend its attractive FCF margin might be impacted as more customers churn.Lastly, the market is oversubscribed to cloud stocks. This increases the exposure of tech stocks to short-term corrections.Atlassian is a solid tech play growing its cloud and subscription business. This shift plays into its long-term growth plans. Atlassian has the resources to manage short-term volatility. I expect the market to continue to value Atlassian for strong, sustainable growth. Investors who have the patience to manage the current cloud transition will find Atlassian attractive."

Wait for a cheaper entry point.","Atlassian (TEAM) remains expensively valued at $30 billion, given its lack of full-year guidance, as well as its expected decelerating revenue growth rate.Even if management is being overly conservative, it's still difficult to justify paying north of 20x sales for a company likely to grow its revenues at just 20% over the next couple of years.Investors should wait for a more favorable entry point of approximately $30 billion market cap. Source: author's calculations; ***mid-point company guidanceBy now, investors have had time to digest the reality that this SaaS company didn't feel confident enough in its full-year outlook to issue investors with its full-year revenue targets.Or better said, Atlassian didn't deem it suitable to worry investors that it's poised for a marked revenue growth rate deceleration. I've been an outspoken bear of Atlassian, so you would expect me to leap on this. But there's no need for that, the results speak for themselves. For a long while, Atlassian had been a stock market darling, with revenue growth rates in the high 30s. But all of a sudden, it appears that those days are now behind it.(Source)The number of customer adds during Q4 2020 was up 14% y/y, compared with 19% in Q3 2020. Furthermore, management declares that 'despite macro headwinds and slower revenue growth', it will continue to invest for future growth. Meanwhile, investors should expect free cash flow profitability to be hit.However, if we take a step back, Atlassian has a strong history of generating free cash flow:In a time when many SaaS companies had been plowing ahead with an irrational focus on taking market share, Atlassian had looked towards its bottom line, as well as its top line. In fact, this speaks of the strength of its business model. Hence, although the tone of the shareholder letter was one of heavy investment ahead, with a particular drive towards moving customers away from on-premise products towards the cloud, there's clearly a highly profitable business model in Atlassian, with its free cash flow margins often hovering around 35%, while finishing fiscal 2020 with a free cash flow margin of 36%. Accordingly, the investment could work out favorably at the correct valuation.When investing in a high growth stock, investors demand strong growth and visibility.In fact, investing is really exciting as long as the share price is ticking up steadily. While investors are making steady gains, there's little need to ask difficult questions from their investment, and investors are buy-and-hold investors.The problem though is when the outlook over the next two years is slightly less rosy than investors were previously expecting, investors start to question what's the right premium to pay for a stock that appears to be dwindling its growth rate down to roughly 20% CAGR.Source: SA Premium ToolsWhat's more, as you can see in the illustration below, investors' sentiment towards Atlassian had been very positive, as exemplified by a rapidly expanding P/sales multiple:Source: author's calculationsOver the past few years, Atlassian, together with most SaaS stocks had seen its multiple expand as investors were keen to rerate SaaS stocks much higher on the back of their stable business model, based on their recurring revenues. This was supposed to offer investors reassurances. The problem becomes slightly more complicated when the company's outlook is not as strong as it has been. At this junction, investors are less likely to be willing to pay a large premium for a stock that is slowing down at a quick clip.Having said that, if we take a step back and think through it further, there's still a lot to like about Atlassian. We have a company that is clearly highly free cash flow generative, and even if its strong growth rate is not there any longer, its still likely to reach a 'Rule of 40' of at least 40%. Consequently, at the right valuation, I do believe that Atlassian could be a rewarding investment. In fact, I contend that at approximately $30 billion market cap, Atlassian would trade on a p/sales multiple of 15x. Indeed, at that entry point, investors' odds would be substantially more favorable. Atlassian went from Wall Street darling to an expensive stock with unimpressive outlooks -- seemingly overnight. Investors are still expecting Atlassian to bounce back, and hoping management is being overly conservative. Despite my bearish tone on Atlassian, I do believe that this stock could be a rewarding investment opportunity if its valuation comes down to approximately $30 billion market cap."

Please note that due to time and audio constraints, transcription may not be perfect. We encourage you to listen to the podcast, embedded below, if you need any clarification. We hope you enjoy.Daniel Shvartsman: Welcome to The Razor’s Edge. Dan Shvartsman joined as always by Seeking Alpha author, Akram’s Razor. As you know, The Razor’s Edge features ideas Akram’s following personally in his investing on his Marketplace Service also called The Razor’s Edge. I bring a generalist stance and we kind of suss out the ideas, figure out what goes into them, what the research is, why Akram feel strongly or unsure about certain things from where I come out as well.You can check out Akram’s Service, Akram’s Razor on Seeking Alpha’s Marketplace type in Razor or Akram or the The Razor’s Edge on any search bar on the site or go to seekingalpha.com/marketplace and you will find the services.We’ll bring you a guest today onto the Podcast, Justen Stepka. Justin has spent over 15 years in the software-as-a-service space, the SaaS space, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Enterprise Fund, a private equity firm focused on startups. He also worked at Docker (DOCKR) for four years. Prior to that, he founded Authentisoft, Internet security startup, then sold that on to Atlassian (TEAM), where he went to work for nearly a decade.On the last episode, Akram and I talked about the SaaS space with a focus on Slack (WORK), Zoom (ZM), PagerDuty (PD), as well as relative valuations in the space and just what’s going on overall. So we’re going to add another perspective today from somebody who has seen key players in the space from the inside and up close.Before we began our usual disclaimer and disclosure, The Razor’s Edge is a podcast on Seeking Alpha’s the Investing Edge Channel. The views discussed belong to either Justen, Akram or me, respectfully. Nothing on this podcast should be taken as investment advice of any sort. We’ll disclose any positions in any stocks discussed at the end of the podcast upfront.I’m long Google (GOOG), which often comes up, but none of the conventionally discussed SaaS names. Akram is a long PD, WORK, Facebook and Twilio, at least was last time, I guess, I should have double checked. Justen is a long Team, WORK and Amazon.Listen to or subscribe to The Investing Edge on these podcast platforms:So, guys, good morning. How are you guys doing?Justen Stepka: Good morning.Akram’s Razor: Good morning. Good, good.DS: So, Justen, let’s start with – we talked about Slack and Zoom last time. You were at Atlassian for a long time and still own shares. Obviously, we’re talking before the podcast quite bullish on the company. I think Atlassian and Slack especially have a lot of interesting overlaps. I know for us as a company, Atlassian is super well integrated into Slack with JIRA. I don’t think we have Trello integrated. But they’re both really workplace management products to a certain degree.And so – and they competed with each other HipChat, which was something we joked about last time. We also used it at Seeking Alpha at some point. I’m curious what your – how do you view the way these companies stack up you own shares in both? So you like an Atlassian venture event invested in Slack themselves. But – how do you make the – this competitive positioning or the relative positioning of these companies?JS: Yes. I mean, as you said, I’m very bullish on Atlassian and I’m equally as bullish on Slack. You guys touched on it a little bit in your last call or podcast in terms of the integration play that both of these companies have. And I agree with that quite a bit. And the reason that I like that sort of moat that these companies have is, because once those integrations or workflows are part of your business processes, they just simply don’t get [indiscernible].And through that thesis you guys laid out on the last call, maybe a week or two ago Atlassian acquired, I’m not really sure how to say it, it’s like HALP, but it’s – they switched the bow like every other tech companies HALP. And so, I mean, they’re going all in on that strategy that you guys laid out where you build this marketplace, you build these integrations. And once these things are in place and people want to change something, it just becomes too hard in order to rip out the electrical wiring in the walls basically.And so when I look at these two companies, and I look at the leadership of these companies, and I look at the spend on R&D that they do, which is well above almost every other company in their group, I just think that there’s just so few companies out there, like these two companies that are going to have tremendous growth over the next coming years.DS: The R&D things are interesting, because that was something like, Akram made the point that at – on one perspective, Zoom, for example, is really on track, because they’re already profitable. On the other hand, when you look, that’s partly, because they’ve got a engineering team in China. They don’t have to spend as much relatively on R&D.When you talk about high R&D as an essentially building a moat, you’ve sort of seen it from the inside with Atlassian, obviously. But how do you as an independent investor now determine that that’s actually going to good use, like how do you see that, that plays out and that it’s adding to the wiring in the walls that makes it so hard to rip out these companies and gives them protection from other players coming in?JS: Well, I mean, in the case of Atlassian, I was there for a long time. And one of the things that you just have to have in order for a company to be good as leadership, and I’m very familiar with Mike’s position like the Co-CEO of Atlassian, that every dollar spent on R&D is a benefit for their customers and they take care of their customers and it’s going to take care of the stock price.Whereas later in my career, I worked at Docker, I watched R&D get starved. And not appropriately investing in the R&D sitting there watching it and doing it, you can see the value difference in terms of what the customers get. And so it just become part of the way in – with how I evaluate these companies. And so when you do that, the customer benefits, and, as I said, or as Mike said, when the customer benefits the stock price.AR: So the interesting thing there, Justen, which is actually, I hadn’t even thought of it this way. Zoom CEO, his entire literally, ethos is customer happiness. When I think about it, because you just made a good point in terms of investing in the R&D. Like I’ve been on, I don’t know how many Zoom calls in the last three months.I – like I haven’t created a Zoom account. I don’t have any stickiness to the application. Daniel is recording the podcasts on Zoom. People just send me a link, like let’s just say, well, you just got a link or an invite. I know it’s there. I don’t know where it is. It’s somewhere in the computer. Like, it’s just – it takes care of business in the background.Now that’s amazing from a user interface standpoint, and like a simplicity and like frictionless and all that. But when you come back to it from like a stickiness element, is that something that is a bit of a problem, or do you even know it’s there? Are you actually a customer? Because this has been a big debate.When Zoom reports June 2, and you and I have talked about this, the range of expectations and what are they monetizing? How much existing customers? What’s the meeting participant? If I’m on it five times, no one really knows what’s translating into bottom line for Zoom.And we got into that on our podcast and we actually be interesting to hear your opinion, because you are making a point on R&D. And I – when I looked at Zoom last year, and when I bought Zoom at the end of last year, November or whatever, ahead of their earnings at Q3 thinking that maybe we’d get a guide – the early guide for fiscal 2021.A lot of my thinking was still grounded in that environment of Slack got teams on its ass, the market hates that. Zoom is – no one is sitting here saying WebEx, but WebEx, Zoom is making money. Zoom has got much higher ROI. Zoom’s margins are this and Zoom’s margins were like, that like that kicker versus a Slack who is spending on R&D.But then when I started looking at these from the work that I did in January in terms of Uber switching, what I was doing in terms of looking into PagerDuty, Apple going all in and the implementation guy pointing out that they want to integrate it with Slack to use it for like on the go, on the fly, customer support and stuff like this. That’s when you look at it and you say, “All right, well, wait, maybe Zoom is just underinvested and there’s zero mode.” Relatively speaking, yes, from a marketing standpoint, and I think it was you who made that comment, about the Zoom marketing?JS: I did. Yes.AR: What do you have to say about all this?JS: I – look, I think stickiness matters for sure. Churn rate is a variable that is very closely monitored, at least, any – on any product that I’ve worked on, and as well as Net Promoter Score, NPS. And the thing about it as if you lose 1% of your customers every year, you’re going to lose 10% and you got to make those customers up.And so, in the case of Slack and Atlassian, all things aside people making fun of JIRA and not liking it. When you look at the customer numbers of these companies, and you look at the retention rate of these companies, they just continue to go up. So that – I mean, they are very sticky. And you can see that sort of play out with Slack versus Teams. Teams, it’s just been given away.Microsoft has these. I mean, we work with them quite extensively at Docker. They’re just giving credits away in order to convince people to move to the cloud. I mean, they are absolutely trying to transition their business model. I mean, if you look at the last earning call, it was 52% growth for them. And part of that play for them is giving away teams, they need that sneakiness and they need people to like it.I do a bit of volunteering for young people that are trying to break into the tech industry. And I’ve talked to them about what tools they use and what are their workflows like and questions like that. I mean, they can’t stand keeps. I mean, there’s a guy at PayPal (PYPL) that I work with, they have Slack and they have Teams and the company has gravitated towards slack.And so, I think the stickiness of that particular product is going to be around for a long time. And I would agree with your thesis on the last call where it is extremely undervalued on a P/E ratio going forward against the other cloud players.DS: What – what’s interesting about that is also the fact that we talked about R&D dollars. And I mean, I pulled it up, Microsoft spends something, I’m not doing all the math in my head, but something – almost 40 times or probably 40 times what Slack does in R&D. And obviously, Microsoft has tons of other product lines.But I’m curious with this – the interesting thing and we talked about this last time with Akram’s article from last summer. But once upon a time in tech is about eventually these companies start bumping into each other and then also if they’re attractive enough, a big player comes in? And so we’re seeing that obviously with Zoom. Everybody is now saying, “Oh, yes, here’s you want video, here as video conferencing, we can do that too.”How do you like – and I’m actually not aware of who, if any of the bigger players are targeting Team. But Team, Atlassian has targeted at various times you mentioned Slack. We also – Akram’s talked a lot about PagerDuty, and what the Opsgenie purchase and how that hasn’t played out yet?What do you see happening or what do you see as far as an upstart that actually ends up becoming sort of an incumbent? What makes the difference? Why is it that [indiscernible] upstarts are able to keep their competitive advantage against some of these bigger names, which in theory could blow them out of the water with spend, with reach, with everything else?JS: Yes. I – there’s one – well, the first thing I would say about Slack and Zoom versus Google offering video and Google gave up on video. I mean, it’s made a return, obviously, because it’s something everybody needs right now. But that’s the work for Slack. They only do [indiscernible]. That’s their focus. That’s what they’re going to be good at. They are determined to know their customer more. They’re determined to figure out what is the best way or the best product that they can deliver for their customers.Microsoft, to point of their R&D is, however, many times bigger than Slack. I mean, that’s spread across so many different product lines. And inside of that company, they will have prioritized the ones that they think make the most sense, and that’s where the real energy and thought processes are going go to.Now, in terms of companies are up and coming in competitive, you can look at a company like Trello. Trello, in my opinion, was the biggest existential threat to Atlassian in the history of the company. Atlassian went out and bought it. You can talk about that there’s Asana and other things like that out there, but I just don’t think that people really want to use that product the way that they want to use Trello. And when you see something like that, you’re going have to out R&D them, or you’re going have to acquire.AR: So like in Atlassian’s case, Trello, Confluence big success, right? But they did try to compete against Slack. I think that – I think from your standpoint, actually, it’s really interesting in the sense that, Atlassian tried to compete against Slack and we talked about HipChat. And they…JS: I can tell you why on that, actually.AR: Go ahead.JS: So I brought in HipChat is the acquisition at Atlassian. Well, the one that’s first suggested it and a lot of other people worked on it. So I don’t want to say. When you build software, there’s just a certain number of things that you need. You need an Issue Tracker, you need to build server, you need to place to store your code, and you need a server. And one of the things that we needed was chat.And the reason for this was traditionally Atlassian had put all of their development teams in a single location. And you just have these huge pods inside of various offices. And then you would just use that as a multiplier effect in order to get me done. It wasn’t – there was no fragmentation of the team members.But when we acquired Bitbucket, we needed a chat tool, because the team that was managing was spread across two continents. And so we bought in HipChat, and that was very good product, but we started our R&D. And it was only until we realized that Slack, it was just growing so fast. And the number of people that were working on it are just vastly outnumber the number of people that were working on Atlassian goes back to my point on Microsoft internal prioritization.We just – we underfunded it, and at some point, you have to look in the mirror and have a hard conversation with yourself. And I think that they did the right thing selling the IP to Slack. And obviously, they have a good relationship with Slack, because they acquired this company in their ecosystem and they’re honest with themselves about the direction at the [goal point] [ph].DS: Is there anything – it’s interesting when you think about the three names you own, actually, because Amazon’s famous for AWS is based on their own server needs. And their third-party fulfillment is based on them figuring out how to do fulfillment like this sort of, I forget how basis is described as thinking about it. But essentially, if we serve ourselves, we can eventually or no, if we outsource it, it forces us to provide a good product, something like that.Atlassian, you talk about the need, HipChat comes out of the need, an internal need to just communicate and then you see it’s more likely. I forget the exact origin story of Slack, but it had something to do with Stewart Butterfield, who was making a video game and you needed communication something. I could be confusing that with Flickr, because I heard the same podcast interview with him.But there’s something about that internal necessity which you then export and that combines with the idea of also then when you don’t – when you have a competitor buying them out and having to integrate them, do you see any commonalities in those companies that is why it attracts you to those three? Is there anything worth – thinking about from the broader when you look at software companies as an investor?JS: Yes. I mean, well, the reason I bought it, I mean, obviously, I’m – I really like AWS and continue to have fantastic growth. The reason I bought Amazon was I’m stuck in my house. I got really sick. I mean, I was in Southeast Asia for pretty much the whole first quarter. And then when I came back, it wasn’t good.And I got locked up at home. And then you could just see, I self-quarantine myself and I just started ordering everything from Amazon. And then you can see like, San Francisco goes and it’s like one of the first places in order to institute quarantine. And so it just became obvious to me when I was going to the grocery store. It was crazy stressful.All you want to do is get in and out as much as possible. People would do these like weird dances when they’d walk down the aisles without people and it was like, everybody is just going to switch to ordering. And so that’s the reason I bought that stock. I mean, I do like AWS quite a bit, and the 30% growth on that is fantastic.To your second point, with the combination of R&D, these companies are also building products that they use. And so dogfooding is a incredibly important part of process building anything. And so Atlassian, Slack, PagerDuty, a lot of names that you guys talk about, they’re building the product for themselves and they’re at the tip of the spear in terms of digital conversion. And that’s what makes a lot of these names really attractive in my mind. I don’t own a lot of them. I try to only understand so many of them. That’s the reason I think that these companies are just so attractive.DS: Yes, the dogfooding, that was the principle I was trying to get at. It’s just – it’s – I know I tend to be more of an investor just look at numbers and don’t – when I sometimes separate my business instincts from my investing instincts wrongly and it’s so interesting to see where that DNA plays out. Akram, you had brought up a few – you had brought up Okta in here as something that you wanted to touch on, how does that work? What did you want?AR: Yes. I mean, we haven’t really got into it. Obviously, it’s a super hot stock. And, Justen, wants to adjust his background. It’s kind of an overlap there, right? So Single Sign-On is something that was essentially given away for free or by the giants as far as these big – really large enterprise software companies, I think, Microsoft does it, Google, et cetera. And Okta and their CEO, Todd – it’s Todd McKinnon?JS: Yes, I think so.AR: Anyway, like it’s – what’s the market cap now?DS: It’s about $24 billion.AR: $24 billion, okay. And it’s been like in that sweet spot in terms of stock performance in the last year, I mean, the whole sector obviously has been crazy. But like it’s really come into, let’s call it, we joke about it the cool guys table. We wouldn’t do the cool guys table. It’s ServiceNow, it’s Atlassian, it’s Okta, who else would we love in there.DS: Slack is not in there, obviously, because it’s been plagued from day one. PagerDuty is not in there. Zoom, definitely in there. That’s more of kind of like the aspirational guy right now. But Okta has been in there. And like, we really haven’t gotten much into it. So I’m just curious as to like, I don’t think we’ve touched on it much on our calls.And I was actually curious, because no one would have thought to spend so much money marketing so aggressively to onboard. But it kind of does function like an integration platform, right, like people are reading their business at work reports to go through that when they highlighted opportunity, the most recent one that is pointing out Zoom and all the endpoint and firewall type stuff that people are using for work from home. So they have visibility, right, like, particularly if you go home and like you have all these apps, Single Sign-On is kind of relevant. So go ahead, Justen, what do you think?JS: Well, I mean, one, I think it’s P/E ratio is just absolutely incredible. It was at 40 or something like that last time I looked. But the thing about Okta is, everybody has to have it and their total addressable market size is every single knowledge worker on the planet. Anybody that has a computer that has to go to work is there as a potential customer for them. And they haven’t even really scratched the surface on that.And as more and more tools are brought in to companies and definitely as the integration play there like on Slack and Atlassian. You need a way in order to provision and deprovision users when you are in the IT team at any company. And that’s a big part of onboarding and closing out any of the sort of accompany. So their potential upside is very, very high.AR: So do you see them as like, do you see, let’s say, for example, our Slack and Okta, potential competitors down the road?JS: I don’t think so. They’re just so different. I mean, I don’t want to say never say never. And certainly, every business needs to figure out how to have multiple channels of revenue. But chat and video seem more married than security. They just seem like very different channels to me.AR: The one thing that it would seem that they had done particularly right, which I think, Todd, does highlight a few times over the years, but I’ve seen him speak is be Switzerland. They’re not owned by, let’s call them one of the big three or four. And then the neutrality, because again, that goes back to like a Slack, for example, like neutrality is a big deal. When you do – when you’re sitting and you’re connecting a lot of things that, like you’re winning out in terms of the potential addressable market for them?JS: Well, I couldn’t possibly agree more on the neutrality component. Let’s say, Microsoft or Google or AWS, and they will and they do have security services. You already have and everything is going to be on one of these three cloud providers and they’re not playing nice with each other.And so what if I modify my license agreement, so that you can’t use a particular product on a different platform, or if I refuse to build an integration or something like that, that alone as part of the buying due diligence process that you would do in choosing something is going to be so integrated into your business processes, you would go through the – you would have to identify that in the risk analysis, introducing a security vendor. And so that’s another reason that I think that Okta has such a defensible position or so.AR: So I guess, the next question is, why don’t you own it?JS: People ask me that all the time, especially because they sold off the stuff to Atlassian. And it just seemed so expensive. And my – I buy a lot of stuff on margin and thank you Jay Powell Fed interest rates are at zero basically. I don’t like to buy these things. I don’t like to buy these things unless they’re on sale and it’s way not on sale right now.AR: Fair enough. That’s a perfectly honest and spot on answer.DS: How do you think about, because they’re all, I mean, even PagerDuty, I guess is, for example, close to a value multiple relative to these others. It’s still pricey from…AR: Let’s be clear, three years ago, PagerDuty’s multiple was what an expensive stock was.DS: That’s – and that’s what I’m getting. I’m still – I still invest in furniture companies or something. So I’m in another – so I’m curious when you look at…AR: You’re in Camping Worldwide (CWH), that thing has crushed it.DS: I'm in Thor (THOR), but – which is yes, like vitally something that works. It makes me feel. I’ve got a tiny telecom stock that isn’t actually like up 35% this year. So I’ve got a – I’ve gotten lucky a couple of places, but it’s still – that company I just met, Alaska Communications (ALSK). It’s like five or six times EV EBITDA. And we’re talking about Slack as attractive. And I don’t have the number in front of me, but it’s still…AR: About 25 times the EV to sales.DS: So I guess, the first question is that, that is like how do you – when you say something is on sale, like how are you – we don’t need to go into specific multiples. But how do you think about that? Do you look at end states or do you look at Akram looks at relative valuation a lot, or is that what you’re looking at Justen? Or how do you think about what a sale constitutes in this space?JS: Yes, I mean just to answer your first question, why don’t I own it? I did own it. Yes, I owned a lot of it in January, but I exited most of my positions at the end of February, when I got sick, and I was down on it, to be honest. And then when I reentered the market positions that I have probably around a month ago, I just chose different positions. I think PagerDuty is quite attractive.Can you just refresh me, what was your second question?DS: Well, just how do you think about…JS: Oh, this on sale, on sale, yes, right.DS: Yes, yes.JS: So on your last Podcast, you guys talked about how companies come up with metrics in order to define their customer user base. One of the metrics that I really like that Atlassian does that I pay very close attention to and Slack as well as they published their customer numbers in every quarterly report. And I know what those companies churn rates like, because work there and they’re low, very low churn rate.And so when I look at that, I just – I see that these companies are going to have tremendous growth. And you enter these periods where take last summer, where people just rotate out and don’t care about tech. Everybody is interested in tech right now, because everybody has to have it in order to work remote. And so tech stocks are popular.There’s going be a day, maybe when we all are allowed to go back to the office, do whatever we got to do, these things are going to come down. And I basically have alerts set up and I – when they get below 20% off their top, I buy. And I just – I have the confidence to do that, because I know how well these companies are run.I see their R&D. I talked to their customers. I talked to the people that work at these companies, their happy employees. And so if you like the product, you like the stock. If the employees are happy, customer numbers are going up. There’s a bright future for these people.DS: So maybe the follow-up to that brings to mind is long-term, how many of these companies do you think can sort of stay independent and stay strong? Because I think what you’re describing is, there’s an advantage in investing in R&D and sticking to what you do. That’s the advantage versus the majors.But you mentioned Okta, for example, trading at a crazy multiple. How much room is there to – even if you talk about every and every knowledge worker as a potential customer service and you say that security is distinct from chat and video, for example? But like, how many different spaces are there before they start eating each other’s lunch? Is that still just the fact that the legacy enterprise software companies have so much left to be taken from them? Or how do you think about the blue space or the green space or whatever?JS: I mean, the green spaces is any company that’s cloud first. If you listen to the Microsoft earnings call is a great example. And you guys talked about the word accelerate. But when Satya Nadella said, he said something like no material impact to our business, if anything accelerated the digital transformation.AR: Oh, we made how many minutes? 38 minutes to accelerate it, pretty good.JS: So these cloud companies that are cloud first and integrate with each other and have stickiness and our customers like them, I like those. I mean, it’s a pretty simple investment thesis. And I only need to know a few of them. There’s this great question where Warren Buffett gets asked and only stocks he owns and he says one. And I feel the same way like if I can understand a couple of these companies really, really well, then I can go very heavy into those positions.AR: I mean, you’ve also been – we didn’t get into this, because he doesn’t own it now. But he’s – we’ve talked about many times, which he is just waiting for it to get cheaper one day, again, I assume is ServiceNow?JS: Yes, I like that one, too. That one, I mean, you got Bill McDermott run that thing. I mean, that guy has laid out an incredible vision for where he wants to take it. He is magnetic personality. So as long as he is at the helm of that company, I believe him when he says he is going to get that company to $10 billion in sales. And everybody needs ITSM. In a way to your point Daniel, it does compete with Atlassian. But there are a lot of knowledge workers out there. And so there’s plenty for everybody to eat.DS: So where – you’re describing a sort of really focused concentration, which I always admire. I can’t – I struggle. Both of you guys have a lot of confidence in your positions. Me, maybe because I don’t have the time to really dive into the details, I tend to prefer a little bit more diversification. But where are you looking right now for what next to watch for or where else?I mean, you’ve mentioned a couple of verticals, whether it’s ServiceNow, Okta or whatever else. But where are other spaces that you’re thinking about learning more about? Or are you more focused on continuing to understand what you own right now?JS: There are two companies that I would like to acquire positions in and they’re private companies. I’ve tried to do several brokered secondary market transition or purchases. One is called segment. It’s a company. But it’s still – it’s basically data streaming is the thesis I do. Every company is generating global amounts of data. And they want to be able to tap into this data. They want to be able to route this data. They want to aggravate it. You want to visualize this data.There’s two sort of customers, in my opinion. There’s companies that are too small to run the infrastructure on their own and they need something that is very easy to set up. And then you’ve got one – other ones that need to collect, like GE, where they want to collect all of the engine data from a plane and shove it into a database and make design decisions and repair decisions and things like that.For smaller customers, it’s like, hey, I want to track my customer across all my websites, things like that. So these data streaming companies are very attractive to me. So segment is one. That’s for the sort of small-cap company and below. And then the other one is Confluent. Confluent is started by some employees that came out of LinkedIn. And they wrote some open source software and then they basically packaged it up and they started selling it to companies like GE in order to monitor engines, and every company in the future is going to need this technology.And so I would love, I mean, I’ve tried many times. One time shares came for sale and I was in a pub in Sydney earlier this year, and it was a very – it was a seven figure amount of shares that came available. I couldn’t get a hold of my business partner. He was – there was like a health thing that was going on in hours and no shares gone in hours, just hours.AR: What about the hottest thing that was funny someone today [indiscernible] and he’s really smart investor out of the UK. And he was like asking me about, it was on a call and they were discussing Snowflake. And when he asked me about it, he was like, “What do you think about Snowflake?” I was like Ballon d’Or, The Lord of the Rings, land across the sea. I mean, well, I mean, like that is – and we talk about hot private companies touched by The Hand of God, everybody talks about Snowflake. Any thoughts on that one?JS: Yes. I mean, I didn’t get a chance to really touch it very much when I was at Docker. The data analytics team reported into me and I remember it was always on the backlog and I think they started on this as I was transitioning out of Docker or semi-retiring. The engineers just love this product and they just thought it was the Golden Calf.And so I hear great things about it. But I don’t have any experience with it. And so it’s hard for me to say how great it is. In general, I would say, one thing about databases is, they’ve just gotten so specialized over the last decade. And there’s going to be a winner in every category of specialization.AR: Okay. Daniel, any other questions along those lines? Oh, we didn’t talk about Twilio (TWLO). By the way, in the news today up 7% this morning, my buddy Captain Twilio has been blowing me up all day, because they’re going to be doing the contact tracing in New York City. What do you have to say about that one? I mean, obviously, that one had a huge move and it’s prompted a lot of my thinking around Slack rerating. Twilio was in the doghouse?JS: Yes, I owned a lot of Twilio and very bittersweet to see that thing go. So I sold it at a loss and it just rockets. They’ve got great leadership. They’ve got a long-term vision. They’ve got a great boss. But I know quite a few people that work at that company and they’re very, very happy working there.DS: On the – I guess, the only other thing I was curious about since you brought up and you focus on the private market – your private equity with Enterprise Fund. Are you seeing – I see reports, mostly headlines, I don’t go into too many of the reports, may information are from similar publications about, this is a pretty disruptive time it seems like for at least earlier on VC and that sort of thing.But are you seeing, I mean, that this – what you just described is still very companies that are at least still in high demand in the segment and Confluent. Are you seeing anything different in the space as you look at in the private market as compared to the public market, where SaaS is still super hot? Or is it mirroring the private market?JS: Well, I mean, we don’t get to see as much as the other people do. So just for the listeners, another guy at Atlassian, we basically, we run a syndicate fund. And when we find deals, we pull together people that used to work at Atlassian, or were part of the Atlassian partner network.And so the companies that we look at are very, very specialized in terms of playing sort of his diagonal, sort of cast actors to Atlassian. We did two deals. It was hard to raise. We did them over the last few months. And people got very reluctant who were very bullish six months ago, for obvious reasons with COVID.But the one thing I would say, I see a lot of AI companies. Everybody is trying to figure out how to apply artificial, mostly machine learning to business processes, or enable companies to have tools in order to invest in their own experiments applying machine learning in order to improve the business.AR: Justen, long it’s going be very happy to hear that in video, the unstoppable force?JS: They had great earnings yesterday.AR: I mean, that’s just – that’s like the new bluest of blue chips these days. So funny considering the history of it. Personally, I’ve been on both sides of it. And now I mean, they’re doing great. He’s just – he’s a character. There’s not much else to say how I think you can be more charismatic and more confident and excited as an owner, CEO, Founder, and that guy.I did want to ask you, though, so like in terms of perspective, in terms of flipping from the inside to the outside, do you feel like there’s any blind spots you have? Because I will say that, in my ears, talking to people, when you’re doing – when you’re crossing over, people be like, “Oh, how do you do this?” I’m like, “Listen, I talk to people in the industry and I formulate an opinion.”I talk to a perfect example, PagerDuty. A lot of my research in the beginning indicated, and my past experiences were like, this is going get crushed by Splunk and Atlassian. And the reason it hasn’t been crushed yet is, I don’t want to put my digital fire alarm in a poorly funded startup. That was part of a thesis and did some homework. And actually, you and I connected around that time, and we both talked about it and look, the short worked out great.But you come back, like a year later and you’re like, this thing is sticky. And like, I’d heard a little bit of that from one or two people in the beginning. It was just like, why are we going spend here at $100 billion-plus enterprise software company like, we don’t need to spend time. This is integrated with like, 2,500 services, ripping it out to save 300 and we have better things to do. The one guy who told me was like he’s like, it’s literally the last thing we would look at replacing right now.JS: Yes.AR: So – but when I talk to people like that, and I’ve been doing this for over a decade in terms of like the level of fishing around in the industry, and it’s almost expert network conversations and trying to formulate an opinion by both weighing both sides, sometimes you flip and sometimes you don’t. I do wonder when I talk to a lot of these people, I’m like, how can these guys not see it? Like, why aren’t they looking at this? And forgetting whether they have the opportunity to invest.But sometimes you talk to them and you’re like, they just have blinders on, because they don’t see it. The way people see it from the investment community. I look back at PagerDuty’s last earnings, and they sent like a thank you message to everyone on Zoom. Using Zoom would like the 100, what do you call it the tile pad screen. And then they get on the – they hosted earnings conference call with like a choppy connection on like a bad phone like it was like 1985. And I’m like, these people don’t get it.Like, why am I a shareholder now? I need to go back to being short the stock. I mean, like, that that’s what you’re thinking at that time. So like to kind of get right to the point is just that, do you feel that you haven’t been on the inside, may have some blind spots coming to the outside?JS: Well, I mean, I certainly feel like I’ve learned something everyday, that’s for sure. And I sit on these earning calls and it’s clear that I don’t understand the financial components, as well as these analysts that are at these calls – that are on these calls and they’re talking about take forward revenue.And they obviously have very complicated spreadsheets, where they’re modeling out to girls in the company. And certainly, as an insider at the company, I was responsible for coming up with projections as well. If people are in finance, they’re doing it their whole careers, they probably have degrees in it. They certainly are better equipped than I am at this point. That’s for sure.The way that I do my theses now is, as you know, it’s leadership. It’s our only customers. That’s what I look at. This company is being well run – is the product being improved and are the customers happy and that’s the way that I ran the products. In my experience when you focus on it with Apple regard and obviously, you have to keep the checkbook balance when you’re building these things. But if you’re doing that, you’re going to increase the value of the company.So, as I transition out one of the things that I do worry about is to your point on Snowflake, I didn’t use it. And I’m not paying attention to the new products way that I was paying attention to the new products before. But the one thing that I do, where my partner Ben and I have an advantage in is, because we were operators.People bring us in and then we get a chance to look at a lot of these up and coming companies and we see the ways that they’re doing business, the ways that they want to change the way that companies are being run and developed and the technologies that are applying. And so over 10 years as the knife gets dollar in terms of relevancy to be an operator, I’m hoping that the lens through the startups that we look at will be over back out.AR: All right, that’s an excellent response. Anything else on your mind? What about work from home? I was having a conversation. I work from home yesterday with a friend. And it just, it got me depressed for one respect where I was just like, if these – if I was 20 years old, just coming out of college. And the one thing I wanted to do when I graduated was moved to New York City.I wanted to live in the middle of the city. I didn’t care if 98% of my income was going to it, because I wanted to – I didn’t want to commute. I want to be able to walk out of my office and like go straight out that, like spend as little time as possible. And I think about – when you think about innovation and servicing customers and developing these companies, the social health factor in if you’re working and you’re motivated at one of these top companies, you were pointing out when you started at Atlassian and like how engineering was heavy on one end and not remote.Unlike most tech, like a PagerDuty CEO will tell you, we were 40% remote before this. If you look at it now, you’re like are some of these companies if I want to work at Google or Facebook for some of these people, it’s like you’re a young guy. You want to meet girls. You want to make friends. You want it, like there’s a social element. Does – is there going to be a backlash in tech? Because we’ve seen stuff in the last like two days, where we started out with like, hey work from home was awesome.Hey, these are the leaders of the tools to we got to a point in the last like week, where like we’ve got Tobi from Shopify tweeting with his face mask on that work from home is permanent and the digital transformation. You’ve got Jack Dorsey, Twitter what went first, then Square. You got Facebook Zuckerberg just yesterday talking about it like, tackle is like, this pandemic is bad wink, wink.Like you look at it like, is there going to be a backlash potentially sometime a year from now it’s like I want to be in the office. The office isn’t my offsite. I would like to see some people. I would like to like – I would think about the amount of times I wasted when I first started working like, yes, let’s go to lunch.JS: I mean, you get a lot out of that, by the way, going to lunch with your coworkers. I do think there’s going to be a lot of people that want to go back to the office. To your point in New York, I have an apartment in the city, but I’m not there now. And we got blue boxes that you have stand in as you go to the elevator, and sanitize your hands. And it’s one family in an elevator at a time. I mean, that’s incredibly fatigue.I play a lot of ice hockey, it’s an outlet for me. And there’s guys that are chirping all the time on e-mail or at the game or whatever. There’s guys that just have fallen off the face of the map. So clearly, the mental health issue is a real issue. The sooner we can get people the safe ability to get out of their house and go do what they need to do, I think, they aren’t going walk back to the office.Now the flip side of that coin is my business partner. He said he moved all of this stuff out of our office in SF. And he said, he is not going back into an office until there’s a vaccine. So you got people like that, too.AR: I mean, look, that’s fine. And I can completely 100% relate to that. The way I’m thinking about it more from the standpoint and I don’t know like, Daniel, also you can relate, like where it’s, look, at our age and I mean, particularly for you, like it – like, we’re past that, trying to figure out what you’re doing. Like you coming out of school, you’re seeking experiences. And I think a lot of these companies are defined by those young people.Work from home when you’re over 40 like me, or whatnot like it’s not a big deal. You have your established friends. You’ve got your network – networking being such a big deal in the sense like, you’ve built it. You’ve been building it over 20 years or whatnot. But if you’re coming right out of school, you have it.And like one of the most, I would say, ideal places you do it, whether it’s finance, you’re an investment banking analyst class, and you guys are hitting – you’re hitting the bars after work and whatever, that whole kind of culture, work hard, play hard, I think that gets tripped. But the offset to it, which is where like, I’m curious of your opinion is, there are huge benefits to tech. They can now access legitimately in a hardcore matter labor all over Planet Earth, particularly on engineering it.JS: That’s a pretty big advantage. Yes. I mean, I think, everybody should go to the office when they can. I think there’s – they called FaceTime for a reason. Everybody needs it, it matters. And I agree with your sentiment on this potentially heavily impacts the careers of young people in terms of them building their network.I think there was a Wall Street Journal Podcast maybe a week or two ago that said that people who are established in their career are fine, who have been working at places for a long time are fine. But new employees and young people aren’t able to cross pollinate, and that will have a drag coefficient on efficiency.Now, Flipside is maybe you figure out that you can work remote. And there are a lot of companies that do. I like to work remote occasionally. I mean, if I needed to get something done, I would stay at home or I would find a place to go isolate myself. And if you can adopt those workflows and methodologies, maybe you can find an engineer in a different place that otherwise would be available to you, you can’t move to your city. So it all just depends on your culture and ways that you want to operate your business.DS: Well, I – because I’ve been working for remotely since I joined Seeking Alpha, we were talking about this all before the call, Justen. But I think what’s interesting, there’s the cultural aspect of it, which I think it forces you when you work from home. First of all, work-wise you have to be more communicative. I have become partly, because I also work for an Israeli company. And that’s sort of the culture in Israel.But I have become a lot more assertive during my time as a remote worker. And so I think there are certain ways that are interesting to compensate. And also, I think a lot, for example, somebody I’ve cited before on our podcast and while read Derek Thompson in The Atlantic. He wrote an article about how central work is in our lives. And so when you’re talking about that social networking, and I met my wife at my first professional job, really, so it’s not – we’re not saying I’m different in that way.But like there’s not having the workplace forces you to then try to make cultural or social connections and other ways, which I think there. So I’m just interested in the mitigation. What I think from a business perspective is really interesting. And one of you hinted at this is, I think, if this trend persists, it’s super deflationary for the salaries in the industry.I just think it all of a sudden maybe your best case is, it sort of levels out the playing field, so that the Bay Area is not or New York is not a premium. But you just, look, I think, for example, I probably don’t command the same salaries I would or I in a location and being able to leverage the local community. I think that’s something that’s interesting to watch.I don’t know if that really shifts over into the bottom line or into the competitive status of these companies. But I do think that the companies may or may not be realizing somebody like Zuckerberg, especially maybe realizing, yes, if we work – if we hire remotely, we don’t have to be fighting for the end data analyst or the end developer in the Bay Area, and that all of a sudden, I think…AR: 100%.DS: …becomes very interesting?JS: Yes, I mean, definitely your salary – I mean, there’s, I mean, they publish the salary index things, which I’m sure you’re all familiar with. And if you are not working in a day, what do you use much if you live in Minnesota, for example, where I’m from and same amount of money the engineers get paid between those two locations assessed.But I do think that there is a tremendous advantage to clustering. And I think that I don’t particularly like the idea fully remote. So, I’m – yes, I’m just not for it, to be honest. And I think that when you can get in front of someone’s face and work with them closely into hallway conversations, those lunches that you go to, they’re long the happy hours that you do at the end of the night, a lot of great ideas are discussed then. And I think it’s important to get back to that.AR: I mean, what good is being wealthy if you’re stuck on an island by yourself?JS: Well, nobody want whatever the Tom Hanks movie is, he wasn’t wealthy on isle. He still didn’t like it.AR: WILSON!JS: Nobody wants to do that.AR: We are the poster child’s for this and you’re on the West Coast. I’m on the East Coast and Daniel is in Europe. I mean, it’s – doesn’t get more spread out really that when you think about it. But I mean, look, there’s – it’s obviously something has been exposed here that I think commercial real estate, as has been shown to be almost a luxury product here.I was actually chatting with someone where he was like he was having a back and forth with a friend with colleague/friend of his, and this guy was in software. And the other guy was in finance. They were debating the whole opening up thing and the commercial real estate finance person was like, “Aren’t you stressed out about the economy?” And I said, “Listen, I don’t think you understand my business. My business benefits from this.” Not that I want it, but like we almost create deflation and efficiency.JS: You’re not making the rules, you’re just playing the game.AR: Exactly.DS: I do think it’s a – it’s – I think it does balance out. I’m bullish. I love cities and I’m bullish on cities in the long haul, and look like, I think in terms of the work environment, I think, this period will have opened the people’s eyes to the fact that work from home for a lot of knowledge work is doable. I think you’re right that there’s still value to face. I mean, I look forward to going to the office, I go to one of our offices maybe three or four times a year. And it’s – and then whenever I get to meet somebody who writes for the site in person, for whatever reason, our paths cross, like, that’s for sure, that’s a lot of fun and something to look forward, too.And so, I do think that balances out. But it is – we’re still – we’re to what, 2.5 months into this really and everybody is very prone to extrapolating. And I’m still without getting into the weeds bullish that in the medium-term, we’ll get a vaccine and life will – the economy, obviously, there’s a lot going on there. But I do think life will return.But yes, it’ll be interesting to see on the margin where the change is common what that means for these companies, both from their – in our operations and from their total available market and all that stuff are addressable market?JS: Well, I mean, you guys kind of comment on commercial real estate. And I’ll say this, we rent office space Ben and I, and Ben has given up on it. He is not coming back until there’s a vaccine, but we rent from Wework (WE). We’ve been – we’ve got our own private office that we work, and…AR: Who is that? What’s Wework, that business model?JS: Yes. And they, by the way, Wework as a fantastic product. I will say this. I was working at home for like a year without it and then Ben insisted we get the office and we got it. And it – I mean, it was fantastic to be able to go to work. They have amazing reception folks and a team that take care of you. They want your name. Your preferences.They – they’ll get you the type of beer that you want for a happy hour on Friday like, I mean, they are – they’ve got the experience nailed like a hotel. I love. They’ve got kombucha. It’s – there’s fruit-infused water. There – it’s just a fantastic product. But I haven’t been there, and I’m not getting that product. Why am I paying that bill?And the way that I’ve been thinking about it and Ben wants to abandon it. And I just thought the way I’ve approached it is, I think, we can renegotiate right now. And our lease is up in September and I’m like we’re supposed to go month-to-month in our – we got a prorated rate for a year in order to go into one of their new offices.I was reduced rate, but then at the end of the first year kicks up to a much higher rate. I want to say, it was like 25%, 30% discount. I’m just like, I think, we can get a locked in rate that’s even lower than we’re at now. I think we should negotiate. I was like, we’re not getting full value on payments.So why should we even make payment? And so I think we’re making every payment. But like, how many other people are doing this? A lot? I bet a lot of them are doing that. And so I think the commercial real estate sector is going to become turbulent.AR: I concur. There’s a rule of law element to it, at the end of the day. I mean, I was talking to a friend and just from an education standpoint, medical school and what they’re paying for rent and she wants to hold on to her apartment and no visibility into what happens in New York in the fall. And it’s like, “Look, can you answer this question?”If school resumes onsite come September, do you want this apartment? Yes, my apartment rocks. I don’t want to go up. And what am I going to go up move get my stuff out. I like abandon it, throw it. I have to put it in storage. But at the same time, you’re paying $3,000 a month for an empty apartment. I’m like, ‘Well, like, what’s your landlord say?” He’s like, “Well, I haven’t talked to him like we’ll approach him.”I’d be like, “Listen, cut me a break, I’ll extend the lease go on these circumstances.” I think people have to consider like the flexibility – but like the people who are just collecting rents and thinking that nothing is going happen and want to be hard assets about it, I don’t think that’s going to work out for them.JS: Yes, I think, there’s definitely going to be a deflationary component on this sector of the market. And we can look at the stock price of Dow Jones and NASDAQ into an all-time high, but it’s not real estate and it’s not banks, that’s for sure.AR: Without question?JS: And so I – to friend, you got to have those tough conversations with people. They’re not fun. But the sooner you get in front of them, the better off you are.AR: Yes. I was like, “What are you going do? Are you going pay rent for the next four months and not be there?” But I mean, she did make some good points. I mean, as far as like, what – do I take my stuff out? Do I go up there? How am I going do it? Like store it, et cetera?JS: Yes. I mean, in the – all the way back to the [indiscernible], I can’t wait to go back. I really look forward to that day.AR: All right. And on that note, Daniel, anything else?DS: No, I think that’s a good note to end on. So, obviously, as we discussed these collaboration tools are going to be there either way, but yes, it’s just a weird time we’re in and totally interesting to see when we – how long it takes us to get back to that and what changes stick. So, Justen, thanks a lot for coming on this a lot of fun.JS: Yes.DS: Good to get out of perspective here.JS: Yes. Thank you, guys, for having us.AR: Yes, maybe next time we come back, we can discuss PagerDuty and maybe post earnings find out and we know Mr. Atlassian competition over there, but…JS: Yes, I’d love, too.DS: Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.JS: Yes. Thank you, guys.DS: Just before we wrap, Akram any other positions that we’ve discussed that didn’t come up in the open.AR: I don’t think we discussed it. Oh, I said I saw it. yes. I’ve long Twitter, again. Well, let’s not even bother discussing why.JS: Yes, because it’s like crack right now. All you can do is [Multiple Speakers]AR: Suck me back in. It’s just when I thought I was out.DS: All right.AR: I mean, I can’t – I cannot. I mean like and maybe we’ll bring you up for this, because Daniel and I are talking about it. But the Joe Rogan signs this deal. John Krasinski sold the show in five minutes. It’s like content, content, content. What is Mr. Jack Dorsey doing with – in terms of exclusivity? I mean, he is taking nine minute ice baths and hanging out with Kanye, like, how – why doesn’t Twitter have a premium product?JS: Now you just answered your own question, because he is not focused.DS: All right. I’m going to jump in, because if we get it onto Twitter, we could be here for hours. All right. Thanks so much, guys. Good stuff and best of luck to you, Justen, and I hope you get back to the office soon.JS: Thank you."

        In Q4, Atlassian suffered its slowest-ever growth quarter, and net-new customer adds were also low.
        Unlike other software companies, Atlassian hasn't noted any recovery in sales as the coronavirus progressed.
        Atlassian expects growth to continue slowing in FY21 and for margins to be impacted by the company's increased spending.","For a long time, software company Atlassian (TEAM) has been a solid Wall Street favorite. The maker behind a popular help desk software suite plus a workflow tool that helps teams of primarily engineers collaborate, both branded as ""Jira"", has been one of the strongest ""Rule of 40"" stocks in the market, exhibiting sky-high 30-40% y/y revenue revenue growth while also offering incredible margins and free cash flow. That win streak seems to have come to an end, however. Atlassian shares sank 6% after reporting Q4 results (and more importantly, issuing disappointing commentary about the upcoming fiscal year), putting its shares at about flat to where they were trading last quarter even as the NASDAQ and most tech stocks have soared to new all-time highs. Being in the penalty box is a new experience for Atlassian investors.Atlassian's strong year-to-date performance was predicated on the assumption that as a workflow tool, Atlassian may see a benefit from remote-work requirements across the globe. This hasn't been true so far, however, as Q4 showed Atlassian's weakest-ever revenue growth and a slow quarter for net-new customer adds. And while management commentary for many other software companies have pointed to a near-term recovery in sales momentum, Atlassian struck a tone of caution for the coming year, shocking investors who thought Atlassian may be insulated from the impacts of the pandemic. As a result, Atlassian's premium valuation is at risk of fading away. Even after the earnings drop, at current share prices near $175, Atlassian's market cap is $43.35 billion; and after netting off the $2.16 billion of cash and $889 million of debt on Atlassian's Q4 balance sheet, its enterprise value is $41.64 billion. Versus Wall Street's consensus FY21 revenue target of $1.96 billion for the coming year (per Yahoo Finance and representing +22% y/y - though after Atlassian's latest demand commentary, consensus is likely to drop as analysts publish their post-earnings notes and drop their estimates in-line with Atlassian's outlook), the stock is trading at a rich 21.2x EV/FY21 revenues.While that isn't too far out of line with Atlassian's historical high-teens/low 20s revenue multiple, in the company's current scenario - with the expectation weaker customer pricing, declining revenue growth, and weaker margins - it's unlikely for that premium to hold up.Given Atlassian's inclusion in the rare ""Rule of 40 club"" (its revenue growth plus its operating margins still add up to well above 40) and the diversity of its product portfolio, I'm not bearish on this company just yet - but neither would I be banking on a quick rebound for this stock. Stay on the sidelines and wait for a more attractive entry point. If shares drop to 14x FY21 revenues (implying a target of $148, or -16% downside from current levels), I'd be inclined to open a small position. Otherwise, I'm staying out.Let's start with the concerns on the most recent quarter first. Take a look at Atlassian's revenue trends:Figure 1. Atlassian revenue trendsSource: Atlassian Q4 shareholder letterAtlassian's Q4 revenue growth, at 29% y/y, is certainly still strong for a company at a ~$2 billion annual revenue run rate. But it is the company's weakest-ever quarter for growth, and the second straight quarter in which Atlassian's revenue had decelerated by four points. In the prior four quarters before that, revenue had essentially held stable at 37% y/y growth each quarter.Additionally concerning is that Atlassian had a very weak fourth quarter for net-new customer adds. The company ended fiscal 2020 with 174.1k customers - still up both sequentially and year-over-year, but the 3k in net-new customer adds for the quarter paled dramatically in comparison to 6.3k net-new adds in Q3 and 8.7k in 4Q20 (or 6.2k if you exclude the impacts of the customers that the Trello acquisition brought onboard). On an organic basis, net-new customer adds are down -52% y/y.Figure 2. Atlassian customer trendsSource: Atlassian Q4 shareholder letterIn the company's Q4 shareholder letter, the company specifically called out COVID-19 as a major headwind to customer growth - which positions Atlassian poorly against other collaboration tools that have seen demand lift amid the remote-work surge. Per the comments:Perhaps most sobering of all is Atlassian's comment that these headwinds would endure into FY21. Many software companies have already commented on seeing the light at the end of the tunnel - but Atlassian is implying it hasn't exactly hit its nadir yet.Atlassian refused to provide guidance beyond the first quarter for this year (Atlassian usually offers both current-quarter guidance as well as a full-year view), but it did offer very detailed commentary around what it expects to see next year. One of the worrying comments that the company made in its shareholder letter surrounded pricing. From a growth contribution standpoint, Atlassian expects to see pricing/ASP increases contribute only slightly to revenue growth this year, though it was a major driver in prior years. The company will also turn to discounting in order to accelerate its push to transition its license/server customers (currently about half of its customer base) onto its new cloud products.Figure 3. Atlassian pricing commentarySource: Atlassian Q4 shareholder letterRevenue is a function of price times volume math. As we've seen in Q4 already, customer sign-ups are already taking a hit from the coronavirus, but without the contribution from pricing gains, Atlassian's growth picture could look very different next year. For Q1, Atlassian is guiding to $430-$445 million in revenues - representing further deceleration to just 18-22% y/y, which would set another record for growth lows. And considering the fact that consensus is currently still calling for 22% y/y growth for the full year, Atlassian is looking exposed to estimate cuts.Figure 4. Atlassian guidance updateSource: Atlassian Q4 shareholder letterAtlassian doesn't have a clean story to present on profitability either. The company has declared FY21 to be an investment year, following a strategy it undertook during the last recession to invest in the growth of its business. Figure 4. Atlassian FY21 profit commentary Source: Atlassian Q4 shareholder letterIn planning to hire 1,000+ new employees (which would boost its existing 4.9k global headcount by more than 20%) , Atlassian is expecting operating expenses to dramatically increase. In addition to gross margin declines associated with the loss of upfront server contracts , Atlassian is projecting a big hit to both operating margins and free cash flow. And aside from lower overall profitability, FCF is additionally going to be hit by higher taxes and lower interest income.The picture that Atlassian painted for FY21 is troubling. Management is asking investors to be patient as Atlassian gears itself up for a bigger cloud push and endures through the coronavirus - but though Atlassian remains a solid software company with a huge global customer base, investors remain very short-term oriented especially with growth tech stocks. In other words, I don't think Atlassian will be able to wipe off its penalties any time soon."
4367232,98236,2020-08-11T10:15:10-04:00,"Last week Atlassian announced results for its latest fiscal year that ended 6/30.The results unsurprisingly were another in a lengthy string of noticeable beats.Guidance was provided just for Q1 and it was essentially in line with prior estimates; full year guidance was not provided due to the lack of visibility.The company, in its shareholder letter indicated it would continue to press on its research and development spending pedal and would continue its acquisition strategy.The company has a relatively elevated EV/S valuation. On the other hand, its unique business model produces high levels of free cash flow, lots of innovation and a positive user experience.","This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Investing in the IT space can be done many different ways. For the most part, I think investors in this space ought to be looking for managements who take intelligent risks and who seek to maximize growth at least as much as they do short-term EPS. While everyone is trying to find the next Fastly (FSLY)-well until this week perhaps, or the next Twilio (TWLO), much of any thoughtful portfolio construction is going to be all about entering a well-known name such as Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) at a fairly decent price. Much of my stock selection for my Ticker Target model portfolio is highly subjective, and relates to my perceptions of management choices with regards to growth vs. profit maximization. The news from Atlassian’s latest earnings release isn’t that the company announced a beat. The news is that the company is doubling down on its technology investments during the current period of economic contraction and is willing to accelerate technology commitments to foster growth as the economic impacts of the pandemic abate. I find that the leadership team at Atlassian meets my criteria broadly speaking, with a willingness to take on risks despite the pandemic and to make sizable commitments to growth even at the cost of short-term earnings. I am also encouraged that the team at Atlassian had reported the same kind of incremental business progress that most other software companies have seen with the impacts of the economy on the company’s business tapering off progressively. I was surprised to see that one writer on SA seemingly ignored management commentary about the impact of the pandemic and how it had waned.Here are the specifics of what Atlassian is seeing in the market: “I note on the COVID driven impacts that we saw the greatest impact in April, less of an impact in May, and then again less in June, and so as you take a step back and think about the macro economic impact and free, you know, we believe that both of these drivers will ebb over time in terms of their headwinds to customer growth.”I do recommend buying Atlassian shares or adding to a position. I have been an Atlassian shareholder for some time now, and while I have traded around a position, I expect to maintain a holding in the shares for years to come. Today's software pullback, engendered by some realization that the economy does produce a headwind for most enterprise software companies presents a further opportunity. While notionally, the use of Jira, the main offering of Atlassian can be used as part of a remote work solution, this company, with more than 170k customers sells to businesses of all sizes, who have experienced all kinds of impacts from the virus and the contracting economy. Atlassian had a decent beat last quarter, and provided in-line guidance for the next quarter. It showed no evidence of hitting any wall-it did show evidence that even software companies are likely to see some impact from a severe economic contraction-just far less than other kinds of businesses.I wouldn’t necessarily recommend buying Atlassian shares because the set-up with regards to another beat in terms of reported quarterly growth is a good one. Obviously, as the passage above strongly suggests, the economic impacts brought on by the virus are progressively lightening, and yet the company has forecast minimal sequential growth in the September quarter and is not providing full year guidance. Last year the company saw sequential growth of 8.6% in the September quarter, and then achieved 12.3% growth in the December quarter. To me that indicates that the odds are pretty strong that the revenue forecast of $430-$445 million for this current quarter will be surpassed. In years past, Atlassian has raised prices for some of its products that impacted the December quarter to a certain extent. As the company has shifted more of its revenue to the cloud, with typical one year terms, that kind of strategy isn’t as feasible. This year, management articulated during the conference call that its plan is not to raise prices materially given the less than stable economic conditions of many of its customers and it advised analysts to eliminate that tailwind from current models. I believe my model, which is based on 25% full year revenue growth through June of 2021, and not much sequential improvement in percentage revenue growth until the end of the fiscal year is consistent with that sentiment.At this point, as mentioned Atlassian is not providing full year guidance. Atlassian is a company whose products have been acquired by SMB’s and enterprises across all geos and across all verticals. In particular, Atlassian has traditionally sold Jira to a large number of development teams in smaller enterprises. The company has seen some churn in that base since the start of the economic slowdown; management doesn’t feel that it has the requisite visibility to determine just how the interplay of churn, the impact of monetizing the free tier of users, and the discounted cloud migration offers will play out over the course of the coming year to provide annual guidance. That really is not something that should greatly upset longer-term investors.Since the start of the pandemic, Atlassian has been viewed to some extent or the other as a work-from-home company deriving some benefits from the turmoil that has been the result of the reaction of enterprises to the scourge of the pandemic. Atlassian shares have risen 45% year to date, although they have been flat the last 90 days. By comparison, the IGV has risen by 33% YTD and has risen 20% in the last 3 months. So, whatever premium Atlassian has enjoyed because of some perceived tailwinds from reactions to the virus has been worn away significantly in the last 3 monthsThere is no real evidence that other than the advent of the economic contraction that Atlassian is seeing any long-term reduction in its growth rate. It has seen some users pause projects and seat additions, and other users churn-not, perhaps to a degree similar to that articulated by Alteryx (AYX) Thursday afternoon, but demand headwinds are blowing across most segments of the IT space with the exception of cyber-security. I will discuss some of the company’s growth drivers later in this article, but the company’s mainstream Jira product including its various flavors continues to be adopted as part of modern technology workflows. Indeed, it is my belief, that the additions this company has made to its product line have dramatically expanded its TAM, and that its highly efficient viral go to market motion continues to work well and should work well for the foreseeable future.I think it is a mistake of the first water to view Atlassian as a middle aged software vendor with middle aged prospects. The pandemic is a headwind of indecipherable severity which is being dealt with more or less successfully by Atlassian using a variety of sales tactics which will have different impacts over different time scales. But the company is doubling down of growth investments, and those should substantially reaccelerate growth beyond the current consensus estimate of 22% shown by 1st Call as the consensus revenue growth forecast for fiscal 2021.As mentioned, the company hasn’t provided full year guidance as a function of the uncertainties and lack of visibility caused by the pandemic and the unknowable impact of the economic contraction on its ability to achieve its sales objectives. I think that analysts who have cited the lack of full year guidance as a negative in evaluating the shares are not appropriately evaluating the company’s product set, its cloud transition strategy, and some of its newest and most unique offerings which are in the process of rolling out. This is not a company rolling into senescence; it is a company lead by two incredibly productive and knowledgeable tech entrepreneurs who are driving the business toward new opportunities.In my own model, I have used 12 month forward revenue estimate of $2.02 billion, which is based on revenue growth of 25% year on year. That is about 5% the current consensus, and but still implies a very modest percentage growth bounce back in the 2nd half of the year.Atlassian shares have never been cheap-at least in the years since I have followed it. The company’s EV/S ratio, currently about 22X forward sales as I have calculated them, is about 20% above average for the company’s 30% growth cohort. I think the premium is well justified as the company has a unique business model which simply expressed trades off investment in sales and marketing for investment in research and development and provides users with pricing that is low enough to foster a viral use of the company’s offerings. The net of that strategy has been much higher operating margins than most companies of Atlassian’s size and growth rate cohort and its free cash flow margin of about 34% is at the top of the range for any of the company’s I evaluate.Despite the pullback after the numbers were reported, the shares are up by 45% year to date, having made a new high just before earnings. The shares have fallen 11% since that point-it is a decent opportunity to either initiate or add to positions in this name, and one that I have taken in the high growth portfolio of Ticker Target, the service we offer investors. For growth stock investors, Atlassian is about as good a fit as they are likely to find in the universe of IT infrastructure names. A core holding in my opinion.Late last week, Atlassian (TEAM) released the results of its most recent quarter. Not terribly surprisingly, the company substantially beat the prior consensus. The company reported 29% revenue growth reaching $430 million in revenue in the quarter, compared to the prior consensus revenue forecast of $409 million. In addition, the company’s EPS rose 25%, and was 25% above the prior consensus estimate. The results weren’t terribly surprising because Atlassian has beaten estimates/guidance consistently for some years now. It is what they do.Also what they do is to guide to levels that frequently engender negative reactions. I am not terribly sure why that tactic would surprise analysts or traders-it has been going on for a long time now and it usually affords investors a decent entry point into the shares. Sometimes the guidance is worse than others-and it hasn’t been unknown for the company to provide an upside to guidance. But during the economic contraction of the magnitude through which we are now moving, articulating conservative guidance for Atlassian, and failing to furnish a full year forecast was probably a foregone conclusion.The company added 3000 net customers last quarter, a substantially smaller add than in most recent quarters. Part of the reason for the low number of net adds was a function of a new free tier for pricing. This tier has substantial limitations in terms of capacity, support and overall functionality, but it is an important tool Atlassian has been using to attract new users during the current economic contraction. I have linked here to the specifics of the offer: Atlassian adds free tiers for Jira and ConfluenceThe company forecast Q1 revenue growth of 23%, essentially consistent with the pre-earnings release published estimate. The company’s forecast for non-IFRS EPS for the quarter was a couple of cents below the prior consensus at $.26-$.27. Essentially, the forecast is predicated on a spending plan that calls for continuing sequential investment in opex, with flat revenues. I would be surprised if Atlassian did not achieve substantially greater earnings and free cash flow than it has forecast.For the last several quarters, Atlassian management has been speaking about a product strategy that encompasses building what Mike Cannon-Brookes, co-CEO described as a “kick-ass” cloud offering. Of the company’s 174k customers, 150k use the company’s cloud products. That said, something like 75% of the company’s paid users continue to deploy some Atlassian products behind the firewall. The company has been offering those users specific transition assistance that allow them to migrate to the cloud without losing their investment in on-premise products that have been previously bought and paid for. By now, the company receives 60% of its revenues from subscription, and subscription revenues grew by 43% last quarter. Perpetual license revenues are no longer a major component of Atlassian’s income-they were less than 5% of revenues last quarter and fell 10% year on year and are expected to decline another 50% this coming year.. About 29% of the company’s revenues are coming from maintenance but as users transition to the cloud, maintenance revenues will probably reach an apogee sometime in this coming year.In all, Atlassian’s transition to the cloud, which includes the aforementioned special offers for cloud migration and a free tier of cloud service as well, is probably shaving 500-800 bps of growth this year, and perhaps some lesser impact into fiscal 2021. But as with most such transitions, the costs being absorbed in the current fiscal year will positively impact revenues in future quarters. While there probably always be users of Jira who want to use it behind the firewall and supply their own infrastructure, I expect that the transition will be essentially complete within the next 12-18 months, and thereafter it will be producing benefits for the company.At this point, revenues from Atlassian’s cloud offerings account for slightly less than 50% of Atlassian’s total revenue. On the other hand, 95% of Atlassian’s new customers sign up for the cloud versions of Jira, Confluence and other Atlassian offerings. :Last year, migrations from server to cloud increased by 60%. Atlassian management believes that its cloud users get a better experience using cloud solutions and ultimately wind up spending more on the company’s solutions and are less likely to churn and more likely to add seats and modules. So, as they describe it-a win/win. I would be surprised if the transition to cloud did not generate a substantial uplift in average revenues per user over the course of several years and self-evidently, the cloud is a more effective way for the company to distribute upgrades and enhancements to users.Since Atlassian doesn’t have a significant direct sales force, this transition has to be fostered by product innovation, effective migration tools, partner services and discounts. Given the very long-lived nature of the infrastructure of what Atlassian offers, the economics of a transition to cloud is highly likely to produce extra growth for Atlassian that is really not yet baked into longer-term growth expectations.I think what investors sometimes miss when they consider Atlassian and its valuation is the rather unique business model the company maintains. The business model, which is part of the guiding philosophy of the founders basically since they launched the business after graduating the University of New South Wales, continues to feature an exceptionally high research and development expense ratio, and an exceptionally low sales and marketing expense metric. If I had to encapsulate the philosophy it is something to the effect that if you provide developers the tools to develop efficiently, and to enhance the experience of workgroups-or teams, you don’t need salespeople. Both of the co-CEO’s continue to be adjunct Computer Science professors at their Alma-mater and they have one of the strongest bromances I know of in the IT space. They are actually next door neighbors-although in their case that doesn’t quite mean the same thing it might mean to most readers-they own the two most expensive houses in Australia and I doubt that they borrow sugar across the back fence, although they were respectively the best man at each other’s wedding. When you buy Atlassian shares, part of what you get is a visionary management team with an exceptional track record of great decisions. It is my view that you cannot pay too much for great management-particularly in the IT space. That said, I do wish their staff would chip in and buy Messrs. Cannon-Brooks and Farquhar access to a barber and a new wardrobe. But that is just me-your 74 year old conservative writer.Last quarter, the company’s research and development spend reached 63% of revenues on a GAAP basis, up 24% year on year. On a non-GAAP basis, the metric was 44%, up from 37% last year. In addition to spending what might only be considered a complete outlier on research and development, Atlassian buys technology-it bought Halp in May, and it announced the acquisition of Mindville in conjunction with this earnings release.The point is that Atlassian spends a huge amount on product innovation, and that is one of the key reasons why it is not seeing any fundamental decline in percentage growth, and is unlikely to see any decline in that metric anytime soon. When investors look at Atlassian, they most often look at Jira-and so they should. But in addition to Jira, the company offers OpsGenie, a tool that is competitive with PagerDuty (PD), Datadog (DDOG), VictorOps ( owned by Splunk (SPLK), it offers Jira Service Desk, a competitor of NOW, and Trello, a list making/workflow tool. The Atlassian offering is extensive and I am not going to recapitulate all of it, but to an extent, when an investor buys Atlassian shares, they are buying far more IP per dollar” than is the case for many other IT vendors.Atlassian doesn’t report its revenue by product type, but the products I have called out are surely components of IT infrastructure software experiencing very high growth rates, even if those growth rates are currently somewhat constrained in the economic environment wrought by the pandemic. In particular, OpsGenie, whose market is part is observability and IT asset management, has a TAM in the billions as does the company’s service desk offering.Atlassian didn’t disclose the purchase price of either Halp or Mindville although I imagine it was barely more than trivial with Mindville somewhat larger than Halp. Halp is a tool that is said to be able to turn a Slack eco system into a kind of help desk. Mindville offers a product that models and manages assets and which was always built to integrate into Jira. Over time, a significant use case for Mindville is enabling Atlassian to be used for something called ITSM (IT service management). The service management space is quite large-the TAM is supposedly growing at 20%/year, and is supposed to reach $14 billion by 2025. In the study I have linked here: Cloud IT Service Management (ITSM) Market Size, Share 2025 Atlassian is ranked as having the highest strategic development index. The addition of Mindville’s solution, which had already been offered as part of the Atlassian Market Place probably will further cement the strong rating of Atlassian’s product offering.The company has a high, but not unusually high gross margin. Last quarter, the gross margin reached In 85% non-GAAP despite the free offerings and promotional migration pricing that was offered in the quarter. Gross margins actually improved from the 83% level reported the prior year, partially because of mix, and partially because of price increases the company has made over the course of the year.In order to pay for the material investment the company makes in product development, it has perhaps the lowest sales and the company spent just 16% of revenues on sales and marketing in this latest fiscal year, compared to a ratio of 20% last year. I have to speculate that if this company raised its sales and marketing spend profile it could sell more product in the short term-but it relies on a viral approach to deliver leads-and overall the result of the strategy has been strong growth for years.Overall, however, the combination of very high research spending, and very low sales and marketing spend has created a business model with a non-IFRS operating margin that was 19% last quarter, compared to 17% in the same quarter the prior year. Atlassian’s business model is certainly different, and it would not work the same way for company’s offering applications as opposed to the collaboration and infrastructure tools offered by Atlassian, I imagine.The company has had a high-free cash flow margin; it was 33% last year, actually down slightly from 36% the prior year, mainly a function of the change in the company’s net loss on its capped call and exchange derivative transactions. That is more of a timing issue than a function of any change in cash generation; that metric more than doubled in Q4. In the past, Atlassian has not generated much deferred revenue. Many of its deals are monthly in nature, and even larger deals with enterprises have rarely seen lengthy duration and up-front payment terms. That might change over time as the company shifts more volume to the cloud where the largest users might be seeking larger, enterprise licenses. On the other hand, the company has been controlling its use of stock based comp and this will obviously limit the growth of cash flow. The company has had and will likely continue to have just minimal capex requirements.The company has said that its plans include the hiring of 1000+ of “Atlassians” mainly in the development space. That is a huge number, given the base of about 4500 the company had at the end of the 2020 fiscal year. The company has said that it sees the pandemic as an opportunity to hire a large cohort of highly skilled developer resources. And the company is also continuing, as noted earlier, to continue to buy enterprises. Much of the focus of the company’s development efforts will be in what is called the DevOps space itself with a dozen new features, automations and integrations recently announced that promote the use of Jira as a single source of truth for developers. The company has seen its solutions in planning tools receive highly positive 3rd party evaluations.The net of these plans is likely to constrain earnings growth, or turn it negative for a quarter or two in fiscal 2021. But ultimately, this kind of investment will result in a stronger level long-term growth and wider product differentiation, leading to more pricing power, and overall stronger margins.I have covered many of the reasons why I believe this company should be valued at a significant premium compared to many peers. Strong leadership, high margins, major IP differentiation, a record of accretive acquisitions and a culture of innovation are all factors that should be weighed when evaluating Atlassian as an investment. Ticker Target has a portfolio weighting in the shares of more than 8%.The shares currently have an EV/S of just less than 21X, about 20% above average for the company’s low 30% growth cohort. On the other hand, its free cash flow margin is amongst the highest of any of the companies that I follow, rivaling that of Veeva (VEEV). I think there is plenty of positive alpha in this name and I think anyone interested in a growth portfolio in the IT space should consider this name."

With both companies set to report earnings next week, along with Akram Razor's much discussed Pager Duty (PD), we wanted to add another perspective to the mix.Justen Stepka joins us on this special episode. Stepka founded Authentisoft, a single sign-on provider that Atlassian (TEAM) bought out in 2006. He went on to work there for eight years, Docker for another four, and then launch a private equity firm, Enterprise Fund, along with another Atlassian veteran. So he has an interesting front-row perspective on the sector and some of these names, even as he's crossed back over to the investing side of the spectrum. And given his portfolio is currently concentrated in WORK, TEAM, and Amazon (AMZN), we thought it would be good to hear from him.Beyond the specifics of these companies, we get into what he prioritizes in picking companies, Okta's (OKTA) in the single sign-on vertical, what the private market looks like, and the second or third-level effects of the current work from home environment.

However, the underlying reality is that we have now crossed the price when this investment no longer makes sense.At close to 30x sales, I charge that Atlassian's stock simply does not leave new shareholders with any upside potential and that shareholders will struggle to make a return here.Atlassian's business model is mostly a subscription-based service.Source: Q3 2020 Investor PresentationOn the one hand, I believe it's worthwhile to highlight to readers that over two-thirds of the Fortune 500 use Atlassian's platform and no single customer contributes more than 1% of our total revenues. This speaks of the very strong appeal its platform has.On the other hand, readers can see in the red box above, that the total amount of subscription revenues is decelerating over time.Specifically, you can see that in Q3 2019 subscription revenue was growing its revenues at 57% year-over-year, while in its most recent quarter, its revenue Q3 2020 growth rate for its subscription services was only growing at 47%.Put another way, Atlassian's revenue growth to a large extent being supported with the help of extra value-adds. Why is that even a problem, revenue is revenue, right?Well, not quite. The issue with deriving substantial revenue from discretionary services (close to 40%) means that the total revenue is less sticky, less stable, and not worth as a high a premium valuation when compared with other SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) companies where north of 80% of their revenues are locked into annual contracts. But there's more.Possibly significantly more relevant is what this implies to its financials.Thinking logically, you will hopefully agree that the margins from subscription-based revenues are going to be higher, than those associated with maintenance contracts. What makes me say so?With the maintenance contracts, the customer needs technical support, whereas, with the subscription revenue for one of its products, the company gets a recurring fee for no further work involved.Indeed, consider the following; this was the guidance back at the end of Q2 2020:Source: Q2 2020 Investor Presentation, Slide 9See if you can spot a difference between the figures above and below:Source: Q3 2020 Investor PresentationWhen asked about the reduction during the Q&A section of the call, Atlassian noted that some of its smaller customers were having troubles and that Atlassian felt it was the right thing to do, to help customers requesting a little assistance with leaner terms.Having said that, Atlassian declares that it is playing offensively, and attempting to take market share during these turbulent times.In the graph below, I've assumed that Atlassian's revenue reaches the top end of its guidance -- to account for potential sandbagging.Source: author's calculationsHowever one appraises Atlassian's revenue growth rate, we can see a steadily declining revenue growth rate. Note, this is for a company where its sector is rapidly expanding, creating huge and positive tailwinds.Furthermore, we should note, that thus far, including its Q4 2020 guidance, on an IFRS-basis, Atlassian remains unprofitable -- although certainly moving in the correct direction, towards breakeven.Meanwhile, despite slowing its revenue growth rate, investors continue to bid up its shares, presently paying close to 30x its sales. There are many SaaS companies valued at 20x sales, including for example ServiceNow (NOW), Atlassian's bigger peer, but at close to 30x sales, I struggle to see any bullish thesis left.Atlassian's top-line revenue growth rate which investors are clamoring for continues to steadily and consistently decline over time. At the same time, the multiple to sales investors are willing to pay for a company that is unprofitable on an IFRS-basis, continues to expand, beyond any reasonable valuation.I fail to see how new shareholders can possibly find any further upside potential. Aside from relying on momentum, and hoping that buying high one can later sell one's shares higher to someone else. This is a very risky investment right now."
4345999,104952,2020-05-11T09:19:12-04:00,"Atlassian is one of our best picks in the software space.It is a founder-led company with strong products, go-to-market, and corporate culture.With a rare combination of +30% growth, +30% FCF margin, and +80% gross margin, the stock beats the Rule of 40 from all angles.Over the last five years, the share price has appreciated by ~7x.It is a must-have in any long-term tech and growth portfolio.","As Venture Capitalists, we are a long-time admirer of Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM). From the time it got off the ground in 2002 until today, we continue to see adaptable and exceptional qualities in almost all areas of the business. This has made it one of the role models in the software space. Over the years, these qualities have translated into strong fundamentals and moat. The stock has appreciated by over 34% since we most recently wrote about it mid last year, where we argued why it was worth owning despite the high P/S. As of today, our bullish view has not changed.Based on the numbers alone, there are many reasons to be bullish on the stock. Over the last five years, revenue has quadrupled while the gross margin has been steady at +80%. What is more impressive is that FCF (Free Cash Flow) has increased by over 7x within the same period and continues to be in an upward trend. Likewise, the share price has also appreciated by almost 7x.(TEAM's FCF vs price/share. Source: stockrow)As we take a deeper dive into what drives the outperformance, we have identified three interconnected key catalysts that will make it a strong contender for any tech and growth long-term portfolio:Atlassian is well-known for its frictionless sales and onboarding in which it does not use extensive high-touch sales approaches to convert clients. The company still maintains this tradition, though it also now deploys Enterprise Advocates as it ramps up its enterprise capabilities such as the Data Center plan. Over time, this has become a moat and competitive advantage for Atlassian. Given the efficient sales process, it only had to spend 19% of its revenue on marketing and sales expenses at the time of its IPO in 2015. As of its most recent earnings report in Q3 in March, we found it impressive that Atlassian still spent only ~20% of its revenue on marketing and sales. Revenue growth, however, remained steady at +30% YoY. Moreover, when we zoom out to the last nine months ending in March, that number even dropped to ~18%. On the other hand, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), which is another software company with similarly strong fundamentals, spent ~44% of revenue on average on marketing and sales to achieve the same level of growth.Atlassian also has a very strong focus on products, which is part of the major reason why it can pursue a frictionless sales model. Its most successful product is Jira, which a lot of IT and developer teams use to track bugs. Its other products, such as Trello, Bitbucket, and Confluence, have also been very popular with both the technical and non-technical crowds. In Q1, the 47% increase in software subscription revenue drove the overall 33% top-line growth for the quarter. Moreover, the customer base has been sticky as 90% of its ~$400 million revenue came from the existing customers. With that in mind, Atlassian is well-positioned to unlock future growth opportunities through expansion. In that sense, the next growth phase will include adding performance and scalability with the Data Center and cloud migration offering. In Q1, we saw very good early progress as the perpetual license revenue dropped by 9% while the migration into the cloud-based offering increased by 60%.(Source: Company's 10-K)As Atlassian will need to rely on the combination of both organic and non-organic growth going forward, its great corporate culture will help maintain the strong product-focus tradition. Both founders still stay with the company, hold co-CEO positions, and own 91% voting powers while opting out of all forms of executive bonuses. To ensure a faster time to market and reduce the chance of M&A failure, Atlassian also has a unique M&A playbook where it focuses on integration more than deal negotiation. When it acquires another company, Atlassian has a very friendly term sheet:We believe that this playbook makes sense since more time spent on integration means more time to focus on bringing the best out of the acquired offering and team. Such a process is even more important in a product-focused software company.Atlassian serves over 170,000 companies across all segments, and COVID-19 will potentially affect some of its SMB customers the most. At the moment, about 75% of the cloud subscription customers are billed monthly, and as such, there is a potential risk of cancellation across primarily the SMB segments, which make up a sizable amount of the cloud subscription business.At almost 29x P/S today, many would suggest that it is expensive. However, this has been the overused argument that existed for quite some time even before our first article on the stock mid last year. Over the last 12 months alone, the contrarians would have missed out on the over ~50% upside on the stock.(OKTA vs. TEAM vs. TWLO vs NOW. Source: stockrow)The reality is that Atlassian is one of our best picks in the software space. Among the other similar stocks in the peer group, it has a more sustainable 30%-35% growth and the highest +80% gross margin. While Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) is a very good company as well that has posted a +70% growth over the last year, it remains uncertain how that is sustainable in the long run. Moreover, Twilio is the least profitable stock in the group. None of the other stocks in its peer group can beat Atlassian's strong FCF, which has also contributed to its very strong balance sheet. Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), the most expensive stock in the group, was only able to convert 5% of its revenue into FCF last year. Within the same period, Atlassian generated ~34% of FCF, or ~$530 million, out of its ~$1.2 billion of revenue. Execution has also been solid as it has never missed its guidance since its IPO in 2015. As a result, the ~29x P/S becomes highly reasonable considering its strong fundamentals and what the market is paying for other similar opportunities."
4349910,104608,2020-05-25T13:47:39-04:00,"Atlassian reported a strong Q3 earnings with revenue growing 33%, well above expectations for only ~28% growth.However, management provided Q4 revenue guidance of 20-24%, implying significant deceleration and was below expectations.After the stock’s recent 20% run, valuation is now ~22x FY21 revenue, which seems to be a bit too expensive for the current market conditions.","Atlassian (TEAM) is a software vendor that specializes in workflow and collaboration tools. The company reported a very strong Q3 earnings with revenue growth of 33% compared to expectations for only ~28% growth. Even though margins did not show much expansion compared to the year ago period, the stronger than expected revenue growth propelled EPS higher than consensus.However, one of the weak spots to the quarter was Q4 revenue guidance implying revenue growth of only 20-24%, which would be a significant deceleration from the 33% growth in Q3. Management does have a history of guiding conservatively and there could be some headwinds from the global pandemic, but nevertheless, it is unsettling to see guidance imply a large deceleration and come in below expectations.Data by YChartsOver the past few weeks since reporting Q3 earnings, the stock has popped over 20%. While the company did have a great quarter, Q4 revenue guidance of 20-24% implies significant deceleration from the 33% growth in the past quarter. Management does have a history of conservative guidance and they could be a little more conservative than usual given the global pandemic impacts on the global economy. Nevertheless, guiding to deceleration and revenue below expectations does not typically result in the stock popping 20%.In addition, valuation has become a bit expensive for my likings, now at ~22x forward revenue, which assumes revenue growth decelerates to only 25% growth in FY21. Even if revenue continues to grow at 30%+, valuation remains above 20x forward revenue, which seems a little too expensive given the many uncertainties in the market today.I believe the company will remain at a premium valuation for many years to come, but history has shown software companies with 20x+ revenue multiples tend to contract if there is a soft spot in the market.Revenue during the quarter grew an impressive 33% to $411.6 million, which was well above expectations for ~$395 million. However, even though growth did impress during the quarter, revenue did decelerate from the 37% growth last quarter as the company continues to see revenue growth decelerate. In this case, deceleration comes as a natural evolution for the company given the law of large numbers.Source: Company PresentationWhile subscription revenue growth continues to drive the overall growth, this revenue type only grew 47% during the quarter, decelerating from 50% last quarter and well below the 57% growth in the year ago period. Investors love to see consistently strong subscription revenue growth given the high visibility; and as a result investors tend to place a higher valuation multiple on companies that generate a majority of their revenue via subscriptions.One area of revenue that investors should continue to focus on is perpetual licenses, which declined by 9% during the quarter and represented ~5% of total revenue. Especially during the current economic challenges, companies are less inclined to spend a lot on upfront licenses and may delay some of their capital expenditures if possible. That being said, TEAM could continue to see increased headwinds from their license revenue, which could impact overall revenue growth.Source: Company PresentationWhile revenue deceleration is natural for faster-growth companies as they reach the law of large numbers, the lower revenue growth is expected to come at the benefit of better margins. During the quarter, TEAM’s gross margins were 86%, which were strong and consistent with the year ago period. Operating margins also remained consistent at 19%, which was the same as the year ago period and could be somewhat disappointing given the lack of expansion.Over time, I believe the company should drive margin expansion via gaining more scale and better leveraging its expense base. In addition, the company's ability to expand margins gives it more flexibility in terms of investing into growth opportunities, such as international markets. Nevertheless, the better than expected revenue led to EPS of $0.25 during the quarter, better than expectations for $0.21.Source: Company PresentationDuring Q4, the company expects revenue to be $400-415 million, which would represent only 20-24% growth, a rather significant deceleration from the 33% growth recorded last quarter. While the company has a history of being conservative (original Q3 revenue guidance was ~28% at the midpoint and actual growth was ~33%), the Q4 guidance range does seem a bit low. Consensus expectations for Q4 were closer to $420 million, although investors likely believe Q4 will ultimately come in ahead of guidance.Profitability wise, gross margins are expected to be ~85% during the quarter with operating margins ~14-17%, near the 17% operating margin seen in the year ago period. I believe management’s guidance does remain a little conservative, though the metrics show Q4 decelerating in revenue growth and not having much margin expansion.While the stock was flat the day after reporting earnings, investors have propelled the stock nearly 20% higher over the past few weeks. Yes, revenue growth was much stronger than expected during Q3, but with Q4 guidance coming in below expectations, I believe these two factors should offset each other. Guidance could prove to be conservative for Q4, but there seems to be minimal margins expansion for now, something which could ultimately be conservative as well.Nevertheless, the recent 20% rise in the stock has pushed valuation up even higher. The stock continues to trade near all-time highs in a market which continues to experience volatility. TEAM’s subscription-based revenue is encouraging in addition to license revenue now representing less than 5% of total revenue.Data by YChartsGiven the current economic conditions are somewhat unstable and investors are still figuring out which stocks will be the next long-term winners, valuations has become somewhat sensitive. Higher-valued stocks may be placed under increased scrutiny in case the market goes through another abrupt correction phase.The company has a current market cap of $45.4 billion, and with ~$2.1 billion of cash/investments and ~$0.9 billion of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$44.2 billion. Management provided FY20 revenue guidance of $1,584-1,599 million, and considering we are almost one month away from the end of their fiscal year, we should start to look out another year.Q4 guidance calls for revenue growth of 20-24%, which I believe is a rather conservative guidance. Even if we were to assume FY21 revenue growth is only 25%, which would be a big deceleration compared to FY20, and FY20 revenue is within the current guidance range, we could see FY21 revenue of ~$2 billion. Using this as our FY21 revenue base, this implies a FY21 revenue multiple of ~22.1x, which seems to be somewhat expensive even after considering next year’s growth is above the implied Q4 revenue growth.While the actual revenue could end up coming in above my estimates, thus resulting in a lower forward revenue valuation, the stock remains expensive above 20x forward revenue. Revenue growth appears to be decelerating, which makes sense given the near $2 billion in revenue and the law of large numbers. However, investors may start to pay more attention to longer-term profitability expectations.Although I am a long-term fan of the stock, I believe valuation has gotten slightly too high, especially after the recent run-up in the stock’s price after Q3 earnings. For now, I am waiting for a better entry point, but note that investors should not be quick to sell out of their positions."

Even though the company is likely to see some impact due to the COVID-19 situation, it is determined to leverage its agile, resilient culture to make strategic bets that would position it for long-term growth.For the third quarter, revenue grew 33% to $411.6 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $395.1 million. Net loss was $158.8 million, compared with net loss of $202.8 million a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.25, better than the market's forecast of $0.21.By segment, Subscription revenues grew 47% to $244.2 million and maintenance revenues grew 21% to $119.6 million. License revenue declined 9% to $21 million and other revenues increased 29% to $26.8 million.For the fourth quarter, Atlassian expects revenues to grow 31-32% to $400-415 million with an adjusted EPS of $0.17-0.22. It expects to end fiscal 2020 with revenues of $1.584-1.5999 billion and an EPS of $1.06-1.12.During the quarter, Atlassian completed the full rollout of free cloud editions across its core products - Jira Software, Confluence and Jira Service Desk. The free editions represent Atlassian's commitment to make its products more accessible to more teams throughout the world.At its Remote Summit early last month, Atlassian announced Cloud Enterprise, its most advanced cloud offering that sharpens its focus on enterprise. Cloud Enterprise addresses the needs of the largest enterprises across Jira Software, Jira Service Desk, and Confluence. Key features include managing collaboration across unlimited users, data residency, and centralized administration tools.At the summit, Atlassian also announced new functions in Jira Align that leverage AI-powered predictive analytics. Align integrates technology from the $166 million acquisition of enterprise workstream management software AgileCraft. Align can now track work across both Jira issues and the more informal Trello cards. It has also added the ability to analyze objectives and key results (OKRs) and to match work activity to outcomes.Based on another acquisition last year of ecosystem partner Code Barrel, Atlassian introduced a workflow automation tool for all its Jira Cloud customers.Atlassian in December last year announced Forge, its new cloud app development platform. Forge makes it easier and faster to develop cloud apps by providing compute, storage, security, and ready-made UI components. Forge is built on Amazon Web Service's Lambda serverless function-as-a-service (FaaS) platform that also helps in managing infrastructure and elements such as authentication, identity and scaling.Forge is expected to increase the number of third-party cloud apps available on the Marketplace, creating more value for cloud customers. There are currently over 4,000 apps available on the Marketplace. In addition, developers have built 28,000 apps for their in-house teams. Across Jira Software and Confluence, over 60% of customer instances use at least one Marketplace app.Atlassian's customer count bounced back in the third quarter. The company ended the quarter with 171,051 customers on an active subscription or maintenance agreement, adding 6,261 net new customers during the quarter. Over 90% of them continued to choose its cloud products. It had added 7,060 customers in Q1 and 5,003 customers in Q2. The slower pace of new customer adds in Q2 was expected to be due to the introduction of free editions of the company's cloud products.Some of the new customers added during the quarter include pharmaceutical company Zentiva, investment management software provider Enfusion, Dutch medical device company Cassini Technologies, fusion power research company TAE Technologies, London-based foreign exchange execution system provider BidFX, global business advisory firm FTI Consulting (NYSE:FCN), and pharmaceutical pricing transparency non-profit International Horizon Scanning Initiative.Customers have also been using its products to navigate a COVID-19 world. St. Jude's Children Research Hospital rapidly expanded the use of Confluence and Jira to help employees track and prioritize work. The United Nations set up a public Trello board to share resources and help businesses respond to COVID-19. Frontline Foods, the grassroots organization raising funds from the community to support local restaurants, turned to Trello and Confluence to power meal delivery efforts to frontline healthcare workers responding to the COVID-19 crisis.In its Letter to Shareholders, Atlassian also announced that it has $2.1 billion in total cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet and generated $156.3 million in cash flow from operations and $140.3 million in free cash flow. It added 359 new employees in Q3, with approximately 200 added in March alone. It is focused on hiring more employees in the quarters ahead.Over its nearly 20-year history, Atlassian has followed a business model that provides it the financial flexibility to capitalize on opportunities that arise in difficult environments. Specifically, it is focused on furthering its cloud transition, hiring, investing in R&D, acquiring customers, and strengthening its long-term market position through potential M&A. Atlassian's long-term goal is to engage 100 million active users and it would look at acquisitions that would help achieve this goal.Atlassian's stock is trading at $154.59 with a market capitalization of $37.94 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $158.98 in February this year. It hit a 52-week low of $106.11 in October last year.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

Its suite of products, including its flagship JIRA software, are oriented around helping teams manage workflows and collaborate remotely, giving the company a boost in a time when many office workers around the globe have had to lean on digital collaboration tools often for the first time. In addition, Atlassian has long leaned more heavily on a ""pull-in"" sales strategy that didn't heavily employ high-touch sales executives. In a time when the coronavirus has hampered business travel and prevented software salesmen from making calls on their prospects, investors were right to assume that Atlassian's revenue base would be relatively less affected than other technology companies.Yet after Atlassian reported third-quarter results, we can see that the stock's outperformance since the beginning of the year (+27% year-to-date, slightly edging out against Amazon's (AMZN) gains over the same timeframe) has already priced in some of this strength. And investors who were hoping that Atlassian's historical growth rates in the high 30s could sustain throughout the rest of the calendar year were disappointed when Atlassian forecasted a continuation of deceleration. Data by YChartsI admire Atlassian as a company with a market-leading product. Gartner Research, the leading software industry analyst and observer, has long rated Atlassian as one of the leaders in the enterprise planning and collaboration space, and its growth to >170k customers as of the end of Q3 at a ~20% growth rate reflects the sheer popularity of a product that doesn't rely on being pushed by a direct sales force.But given all the love that investors have shown the stock this year, and the fact that it has vaulted to a >23x forward revenue multiple (versus valuation multiples in the high teens last year, and most other software companies in the 30-40% y/y growth bucket trading at high single-digit or low teens valuation multiples), Atlassian is unlikely to continue outperforming the broader market. Indeed, the fact that Atlassian trades at a richer multiple of forward revenue than the S&P 500 is trading as a multiple of GAAP earnings is a testament to buildup of enthusiasm on this name. Already we've seen stocks like Zoom (ZM) unwind some of its year-to-date gains; with revenues expected to decelerate, Atlassian is unlikely to be any different.At the same time, Atlassian's rich operating margins (driven, again, by its lack of a sales force that consumes the majority of competing SaaS companies' operating budgets), free cash flows ($140 million in Q3 alone) and strong balance sheet prevent me from being overly bearish on the stock. Keep watching price movements in this name, but don't be tempted to buy any near-term dips.Over the past several quarters, the biggest question surrounding Atlassian was whether the company would be able to continue growing at its high-30s pace, because the company's rich valuation multiple is tied to the promise of excessive growth rates. In bidding up Atlassian shares this year, investors were betting that its popularity as a collaboration tool would rise amid the remote work requirements.But while Atlassian has continued to grow, we didn't see any breathtaking surge in growth like we did at other companies, like Citrix Systems (CTXS) - which saw growth soar from the low single digits to 20% y/y. Atlassian's total revenues grew 33% y/y to $411.6 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $396.2 million (+28% y/y), but decelerating four points over last quarter's 37% y/y growth rate. Figure 1. Atlassian Q3 revenue trendsSource: Atlassian Q3 shareholder letterAll components of Atlassian's revenue fell, including and especially its critical subscription piece. As seen in the breakdown below, subscription revenue growth fell below 50% for the first time, and was also unable to offset perpetual license revenues slipping negative for the first time:Figure 2. Atlassian revenue growth by categorySource: Atlassian Q3 shareholder letterSome investors were hoping that the tailwind effects from remote-work would only partially begin in March and benefit Atlassian through its fiscal fourth quarter, as the depths of the coronavirus impact were only truly felt in April. But Atlassian's guidance for Q4, which covers the quarter through June, implies that this isn't the case. See the company's guidance and accompanying commentary below:Figure 3. Atlassian guidance updateSource: Atlassian Q3 shareholder letterThe key pieces here: Atlassian's revenue range of $400-$415 million (+20-24% y/y), represents growth slipping by as much as thirteen points sequentially. Of course, Atlassian typically sets its own bar fairly low and will likely achieve the higher end of that range, but it's clear that investors were hoping for much more, especially with the supposed lift from remote work demand. Wall Street, in particular, had a consensus Q4 revenue target of $418.4 million, or +25% y/y. And note that while Atlassian expressed its confidence in the fact that it has 85% recurring revenues and draws 90% of its revenue from existing customers rather than from new deals, it cited ""early Q4 data"" to note that the negative impacts of the coronavirus would outweigh any positives. This is particularly because Atlassian's customer base skews toward smaller companies (particularly, small tech and software startups) that have seen a spew of layoffs since the coronavirus began, and thus a lower need for seats on Atlassian's platform.The better side of the coin, in my view, is the fact that Atlassian has been able to maintain a rich fountain of profits even amid softening growth rates. Many of the larger-cap SaaS software companies around Atlassian's size, like Salesforce (CRM) and Workday (WDAY), have long struggled to meet investors' demand for greater operating leverage and profitability, but Atlassian has long been able to maintain rich operating margins. Q3 was no different. Despite a slight 50bps drop in pro forma gross margins (we note that Atlassian's gross margins in the mid-80s are sky-high, even for the software industry), Atlassian managed to slightly scale down both R&D and sales/marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to keep pro forma operating margins flat at 18.8%. Figure 4. Atlassian margin trendsSource: Atlassian Q3 shareholder letterAtlassian's third-quarter free cash flow also grew 10% y/y to $140.3 million, and the company says that it's on track to deliver up to $475 million in free cash flow for the full year. Alongside a balance sheet that holds $2.07 billion in cash and no debt, Atlassian is one of the most liquid companies in the software sector - amid a time when liquidity concerns have forced investors to stream out of some of the smaller, faster-growing software stocks. Still, we note that these rich margins and cash flow are already captured in Atlassian's valuation. At current share prices near $155, Atlassian's market cap and enterprise value are $37.94 billion and $35.87 billion, respectively; the latter carries a valuation multiple at ~75x EV/FY20 free cash flow, which is a heady multiple in a down market that has put many other stocks at fire-sale levels.The bottom line on Atlassian: investors had pumped up this stock in the hopes that the company would issue guidance pointing to more robust remote work-driven demand lifts, but Atlassian's outlook for continued deceleration in Q4 has quelled those hopes. With no near-term catalysts on the horizon, it's difficult to see Atlassian's valuation multiple expanding materially from its current ~23x forward revenues and ~75x FCF, already pushing the upper bounds of reasonability. Stay on the sidelines here."

I will demonstrate quantitatively why the company represents a ""fair value"" at a market cap of $36B. I will share with you what you could expect in the way of returns, should you decide to purchase the company today.TEAM capitalizes on an investment mega-trend that I have coined ""the Digitization of Reality,"" that has accelerated due to the present Covid-19 crisis. According to our valuation model, TEAM's free cash flow and the growth thereof presently justify the company's valuation.The thesis: There is a growing entity, known as the ""digital world,"" that will eventually reach a point at which its existence will be more permanent and valuable than our own tangible reality. There are a number of ways to play this growing digital world, which is truly in its initial stages, one of which is through the digitization of our work lives. TEAM perfectly captures this creation of a ""digital world,"" as it digitizes, or virtualizes, management of the development of the ""digital world""...That was a mouthful, but it really is quite simple! The company assists in mankind's transition to a digital world wherein our lives are lived most profitably through the digital world first (even for services that offer physical experiences), and in the tangible world second. There is innumerable evidence for this growing phenomenon, and the many companies capturing, which I own, have allowed me to beat the market throughout one of the most violent corrections in recorded stock market history.Atlassian is an enterprise software provider with a wide range of collaborative products across Software Development, Project Management, and Content Management. Here's a quick summary of the company's flagship product. Essentially, it manages the workflows associated with software development. As I mentioned above, TEAM is providing critical infrastructure for the development of our new ""digital world.""TEAM is no flighty startup. It's an established juggernaut, a rapidly growing company that serves over 135,000 customers worldwide!TEAM was founded in Sydney, Australia in 2002 by Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, co-CEOs who bootstrapped the company using a credit card. Considering that the company currently boasts a market cap of $36B, such a story is pretty incredible. Suffice it to say, TEAM is not a venture capital soaked publicity stunt (read: WeWork). Instead, it's a company born out of humble beginnings that has come to dominate the software project management landscape.The company started with 'Jira,' which we discussed above, and followed it up with 'Confluence', a collaboration tool for document sharing. Both products are extremely differentiated/successful in the marketplaces in which they're sold, as evidenced by the company's 83% gross margins.Now that I've briefly described the core businesses of TEAM, let's delve into the financials of the company; after which, we will run its financials through our valuation model to ascertain whether one should purchase the company today and what one should expect in the way of projected returns.In order to understand TEAM's fundamentals, let's take a look at some of the key metrics posted by the company since it IPO'd in Dec-2015.Income Statement AnalysisSource: Y-ChartsIn the chart above, we see that annual revenues have grown at CAGR of +38.27% from $387.3 million to $1,416 million (3.66x in just 4 years). This is extraordinary growth!The impressive revenue growth is achieved at stable and lofty gross margins of +80%. You can see a dip in margins in 2017, which may have been a COGS accounting anomaly for that period, because since that time, gross margins have expanded and stabilized at above 80%.Additionally, with increased investments in research and development, TEAM has been able to introduce new and exciting product offerings to the market in the last two years, and as a result, margins are back up at +82% with accelerated revenue growth.Financial Stability AnalysisWe have already seen that TEAM has grown rapidly with stable, lofty gross margins. They are certainly impressive and demonstrate that the company sells a highly differentiated product that commands pricing power.But don't submit your buy order just yet. Let's explore its balance sheet and free cash flow.Source: Y-ChartsTEAM's balance sheet is truly a sight to behold. With a net total long-term debt at -$1.066 billion, TEAM carries almost no bankruptcy risk. Further, with such a pristine balance sheet, the company has immense leverage to execute a number of strategies, by which shareholder value could be further enhanced. Such strategies might include levering up slightly to make an agile acquisition, whereby TEAM would be able to enhance free cash flow without the dilutive effects of issuing new shares.To put it succinctly, TEAM finds itself in a very strong financial position, and the company can utilize this strength to power its future growth. But we're just getting started.An even more incredible metric lies hidden within the cashflow statement that demonstrates immense prudence by TEAM's management. Source: Y-ChartsIf you focus on the cash flow from financing (blue line) in the chart above, you can observe that TEAM's use of external capital is close to zero. TEAM funds its growth solely through cash generated from its operations.This is truly where the rubber meets the road. It's also the portion at which we excel.In previous articles, such as this one where I analyzed Starbucks (SBUX), I clearly defined and laid out the process by which I value companies. Since then, I've worked with my software engineering team to fully develop and code the valuation model into my company's website. If you're wondering how the backend of it works, check out the link above (the SBUX article, where you'll find an in-depth use of it).Now, the model answers two questions:1. Is a company over or undervalued presently?2. What are the expected returns one should expect buying a stock at today's price over a 10-year investment horizon?And here are the results!L.A. Stevens Valuation Model ResultsAnswer to Question 1:Answer to Question 2:Source: L.A. Stevens Investments Valuation ModelAccording to the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, TEAM's fair value is $146; that is, at its current price of $148, TEAM is about fairly priced.The chance to acquire TEAM at jaw-dropping prices of $110 came and went during the recent lows in mid-March. If you bought it then, congrats on the +40% gains (we did!).But nothing is lost for the ones that didn't, as the stock is still available at a fair price, and you can invest in TEAM at this price with conviction. If one were to buy at this price, the 10 year expected CAGR is 15.80%, which is higher than the 90-year annualized S&P 500 return of 9.8%, which we consider our ""next best alternative"" or ""hurdle rate,"" above which we choose to invest. Hence, the current price of $148 and anything below it, presents investors with a good buying opportunity.Interestingly, a DCF alone tells us not to buy the stock, but with my proprietary logic sequence, which has been coded into my valuation model, we see that we'd actually beat the market buying at today's price of $150.Source: TEAM's TwitterConcerns regarding systematic risk arising from a prolonged recession in the second half of this year are certainly justifiable. But a long-term investor should look ahead of volatile markets and invest in great companies at fair to discounted prices regardless of market conditions. If TEAM were to become available anywhere near its recent lows, it would be an ""all-in"" scenario and a perfect opportunity to buy a great company at an even better price. Further, my team and I have already analyzed the strength of TEAM's balance sheet, and we expect the company to have no problem navigating the rough seas of a recession. In fact, the company will almost certainly emerge stronger at the other end of these difficult times.In closing, TEAM represents a fantastic opportunity for long-oriented investors, looking to capitalize on the secular ""Digitization of Reality"" trend we're experiencing today. In TEAM, you would be investing in a high growth, free cash flow generative business. TEAM's ability to leverage its un-leveraged balance sheet to fuel growth in excess of its already veritably strong core business makes it even more of an incredible opportunity.While we're fans of the company, its management, and its long-term prospects, we want to be clear: it is only a ""buy today"" in the way Coca-Cola was a buy at all-time highs in the 1970s. Had you bought Coke then, you'd have made out with around 12% annualized returns over the last 40 years; however, you would not have absolutely decimated the market, as you would've buying the company at the lows in the '70s. That's how one should think of buying TEAM today, and it's how we think of it, hence we did our strong buying during the market rout in March.Final takeaway: Initiating coverage on ""TEAM"" at $150 with ""BUY"" recommendation.Please provide your feedback in comments below, as I thoroughly enjoy reading anecdotal accounts of the products, as well as critiques and criticisms regarding my valuation!As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow; and happy investing!"
4344068,35181,2020-05-07T09:59:01-04:00,"Atlassian barreled through the latest earnings call as if there were no economic challenges.The company has strong revenue growth, strong free cash flow margin and easily meets the Rule of 40.The stock price appears to be extremely overvalued but we are in the middle of a historic reset with digital transformation stocks rising to the top.Breakout to an all-time high signifies that it is time to buy.","Back in February, I wrote the article ""Atlassian Has Likely Peaked For The Short Term."" My prediction for Atlassian Corporation Plc (TEAM) would have been great had I defined ""short-term"" as a couple of weeks.(Source: Seeking Alpha)After being hit by the pandemic scare as most stocks were, Atlassian has rebounded impressively and is now in the process of breaking out to an all-time high.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)It is clear from my analysis (below) that Atlassian is one of the most valued digital transformation stocks that I track and makes me hesitate to give this stock the two thumbs up. But I believe that we are witnessing a historic repricing in the stock market.It is becoming clear that digital transformation stocks are being coveted, while legacy players are in the process of a crash and burn. When we look back 20 years from now, it will be obvious that 2020 marked the seismic shift to the cloud, the fourth leg of the industrial revolution and this was catalyzed by the pandemic. We won't be going back to the way things were.So, valuation be damned! Listen to what the market is telling you and buy digital transformation stocks. And oh yeah... buy Atlassian.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The metric sidesteps the valuation dilemma for high-growth companies that generally don't show profits. The Rule of 40 allows for both revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) in combination such that they must add up to at least 40%. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can turn a blind eye to negative free cash flow to some extent. On the other hand, if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth.This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. Young companies tend to have high revenue growth but are burning cash. Mature companies have lower revenue growth, but they make up in terms of free cash flow. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In Atlassian's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 35% + 35% = 70%Atlassian's score is huge, way above the necessary 40% needed to fulfill the rule of thumb, suggesting that this company has a healthy balance between growth and profitability.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how Atlassian stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward sales multiple.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, Atlassian is situated significantly above the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is extremely overvalued on a relative basis. In fact, it has the third-highest valuation behind only Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (ZM), and Shopify Inc. (SHOP).I am going to now present a refined analysis given that Atlassian has an exceptional gross profit margin of 88%.(Source: Portfolio123)Instead of using the forward sales multiple for the Y-Axis of the scatter plot, I am going to use the forward gross profit multiple. This gives a slightly better valuation for Atlassian.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)Using this view, Atlassian is valued less than Veeva Systems Inc. (VEEV), Coupa Software Incorporated (COUP), and Okta, Inc. (OKTA) in addition to the two stocks mentioned above. I should mention that, despite the extreme valuations, all of these stocks are expected to be strong players in the current work-from-home market conditions.There are several risks that investors should consider before investing in Atlassian. First of all, valuations for Atlassian and other work-from-home plays such as Zoom are exceptionally high, very reminiscent of the 2000 dot.com era. We all know how that ended.A significant portion of Atlassian's revenue is from small businesses that are most vulnerable during the pandemic and subsequent recession. In addition, less than 50% of Atlassian's revenue is from subscriptions which are monthly or yearly. Companies that are not doing well could choose to suspend or downgrade their subscriptions. Don't be surprised to see a revenue downturn for several quarters as a result.A recent price hike has caused revenue to be pulled forward and will likely cause some customer churn.Atlassian is now offering a free version of its software. The free version could cause a diversion from customers choosing to use the premium software.Atlassian is currently in the process of breaking out to an all-time high. When a breakout occurs, it usually signifies more bullishness to come. Atlassian is a strong company with annual revenue growth of 35% and a free cash flow margin of 35%, giving it a score of 70% on the Rule of 40. The company barreled through its latest quarterly earnings call as if there was no pandemic. While the stock movement is strong, and the company's fundamentals are strong, there is one tiny detail that gives me hesitation and that is its very high valuation. In this case, I am going to overlook valuation and point to the historic shift in economics"
4377665,86786,2020-10-05T14:21:07-04:00,"Atlassian's rise in the SaaS market has changed the company from a tech-focused one to an acquisition-based one.The company is looking more like Oracle these days in its business model, and that's not generally a reason for optimism, especially for a growth stock.I recommend ditching TEAM before its October earnings.","Atlassian (TEAM) produces issue tracking software via a SaaS scheme. While the company is listed on NASDAQ, it is headquartered in Australia. It maintains an office in San Francisco nonetheless.Its flagship SaaS products, Jira and Confluence, have been a major revenue drivers for the company. Yet the company’s services are riddled with problems and are not so well-received by many of their users. While many tech companies would ride the fat times, reinvesting its piles of money into product features or distributing it as dividends to return value to investors, Atlassian prefers making acquisitions.The main problem with Atlassian’s business plan of acquiring similar tech companies is the lack of useful integration. In fact, acquisitions by Atlassian are even likely to ruin the acquired companies’ products and drive away said companies’ existing companies. I know many satisfied Trello users jumped ship after the company was acquired by Atlassian.And Atlassian seems to be directly opposed to improving its original and acquired SaaS products. Right in the company’s terms of service is a stipulation that users cannot “publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Cloud Products,” an idea in direct contrast with product improvement. Investors, nonetheless, seem less informed of these major problems for an aspiring SaaS company and have bid TEAM stock at a rate that beats the average industry’s.Granted, we are in a tech bubble. But with disappointing earnings, TEAM is perhaps one of the tech companies that are hardest to justify with the idea of “high valuations can be ignored if the company is performing well.”(Source: StockRover)I believe this stock is being bolstered almost entirely by the tech bubble, not its own merit. Right now, nearly any tech stock you buy is being bought at a premium. If you’re looking to invest in tech at this time, you should be choosing carefully.While TEAM certainly looked like (and was) a good investment in 2015, with its focus on Jira’s market share growth, today the company’s business sees too much competition from better managed companies with better products. Competition is fierce and growing, and I wonder how long Atlassian can hang on. Just last week Asana (ASAN) listed its company on the NYSE, giving investors yet another alternative to TEAM.In most cases, the tech company with the best product wins. However, marketing can often replace product quality for keeping a company alive. Atlassian is similar to Oracle (ORCL) in this regard; both companies seem more driven to impress, via marketing and presentation, non-tech-savvy decision-makers of enterprises than to organically impress (via software quality) those enterprises’ engineers. (My article on how Oracle is a marketing company is relevant, too, to Atlassian.)But the shift from high-tech to high-marketing is mostly useful once a tech company has matured and become a household name. TEAM is likely still in its growth phase, and the focus on selling product instead of creating an unbeatable unique selling proposition is likely premature. Growth is likely to be stifled by too quickly engaging in the “value stock” business model.I believe earnings will reflect this. TEAM is reporting its quarterly earnings in mid-October and without highly impressive numbers the company will likely disappoint investors who are currently justifying TEAM’s high valuation by growth potential. My earnings prediction methods (learn more here) point to TEAM being a high-risk, low-reward hold through earnings.I would likely ditch this stock, were I holding it in October. Indeed, seasonality seems to show the last three months of the year as being underperforming months for TEAM. Data is lacking due to TEAM being newly listed, but the preliminary data point to weakness:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Tiingo)TEAM will need to show a turnaround in earnings growth this quarter for a significant upside movement. Currently, we have profit margins on the downturn. With operating expenses increasing, increasing margins are needed to compensate:(Source: Simply Wall St)With the trend downward and nothing new significant from the company, it is hard to expect a sudden spike in EPS. Extrapolating the current trend give an 11.9% reduction in earnings per year. Other measures of profitability show an increasingly dire situation:(Source: StockRover)In short, Atlassian is an unprofitable, poorly received (by users), and mismanaged company with a stock at nosebleed valuations during a tech bubble. It is an issue tracking SaaS company that (allegedly) manages itself internally via post-it notes. Even its managers seem not to have much faith in its products; this is where I would usually show insider trading activity, but I oddly (as individual insiders hold 50% of the shares) cannot find any instances of insider buying or selling for this company – if anyone knows why, please let me know in the comments section below.With TEAM heading into earnings near all-time highs despite recent share dilution and declining profits, the short side of the trade looks much more appealing than the long side. Even as a hype stock, TEAM looks overpriced. Earnings has a way of unveiling reality to investors, and I’d like to see TEAM pull back to around $150 before even thinking of calling it fairly priced."
4335944,20715,2020-04-03T18:39:53-04:00,Atlassian has seen solid earnings and sales growth in recent years while Slack just started trading in June 2019.Both companies could see a boost in revenue with more and more people working from home due to the current circumstances.Atlassian has been trending higher since 2017 while Slack has been trending lower since it debuted.,"The idea of a pair trade is that it is designed to make money regardless of market conditions. One side of the trade is a bullish or long position and the other side of the trade is bearish or short. The two securities should be highly correlated and ideally from the same sector or industry. Given the current market conditions and the uncertainty in the market and the economy, I thought the idea of a paired trade made sense.In this case, I looked at two software companies that are both in the enterprise software industry - Slack Technologies (WORK) and Atlassian (TEAM). I am suggesting going long Atlassian and shorting Slack Technologies. The reasons for this narrative are the fundamental indicators for Atlassian are much better than Slack's and Atlassian's stock is near support.I put the fundamental indicators of each company into a table, at least the indicators that I find to be most important. What we see is that Atlassian has seen earnings grow by an average of 51% per year over the last three years and the EPS jumped 48% in the most recent quarterly report. Slack saw its earnings fall by 129% in its most recent quarterly report. Slack debuted on the NYSE on June 20, 2019.Slack's sales have grown nicely in recent years with the average increase being 84% per year over the last three years. Sales jumped by 49% in the most recent quarterly report. Atlassian has averaged sales growth of 39% per year over the last three years and they jumped by 37% in the most recent quarter.Slack has lost money in every quarter since it went public and that is the reason the EPS growth rate for the last three years shows 0%. One, the company hasn't been public for three years and secondly, the company has been losing money. It lost $0.43 per share in 2019. This also means a return on equity isn't really calculable. On the other hand, Atlassian boasts a ROE of 29.1% and that is well above average. The profit margin for Slack, at least from Investor's Business Daily, is at -90.1% while Atlassian's profit margin is at 22.9%. That indicator is also above average.Looking at a performance chart from the beginning of July '19 through the end of October '19, we saw Atlassian and Slack both fall, but Atlassian only fell 7.68% while Slack fell 41.33%. If you had been short Slack and long Atlassian, you would have made more money from the short than you would have lost on the long position. If you committed equal dollar amounts to each side of the trade, which is how it is supposed to work, you would have made money.From the beginning of November '19 through the high in the market on February 19, 2020, both stocks moved higher. Once again Atlassian outperformed Slack with gains of 25.88% and 25%, respectively. During this leg, it was essentially a breakeven for the whole trade.In the initial move in this most recent swing, Slack dropped just over 38% from February 19 through March 16 while Atlassian dropped 20.7% during this same period. Since then, Slack has jumped sharply while Atlassian is only up 7%.If we look at the whole picture, from June 20 through April 2, Atlassian is down 4.47% and Slack is down 37.18%.While the performance charts show us how the returns break down over the various periods, looking at the weekly charts shows the trend in each stock. For Atlassian, we see that the stock has been trending higher since the beginning of 2017 and recently found support at the $110 area. The stock is also above both its 52-week and 104-week moving averages.Slack has been trending lower since it debuted. Originally, the stock found support in the $20 area through the fourth quarter and January. The stock bounced in the first part of February and then fell sharply and broke to a new low at $15.10.We see that the stock is far from oversold after rallying so sharply over the last half of March, but the stock has reversed sharply lower in the current week. We don't have enough data to calculate a 52-week moving average yet, so we can't compare that aspect of the charts.The major shift in people working from home in the past few months could potentially benefit both Atlassian and Slack Technologies. Personally, I have used both software packages and can honestly say that they are equal in usefulness. I found Atlassian's software a little easier to navigate at first, but Slack's overall user-friendliness was better.Regardless of personal preferences, the fundamentals for Atlassian are much better than Slack's at this point in time. The chart for Atlassian looks better, but it isn't an equal comparison because of the short period Slack has been traded publicly.There is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the overall market and the economy. I personally think we are at the beginning of a bear market phase and that we could see a few more legs to the down side before we reach an eventual bottom. If that is the case, both of these stocks could move lower again, but I think Slack falls more because of the less attractive fundamentals. If I am wrong and the bottom has already been put in, I think both stocks move higher in the next few quarters, but I like Atlassian better because of its consistency, something Slack hasn't provided yet.Ideally, in this trade scenario, you would see Atlassian gain ground in the coming months and Slack would fall - that would be the perfect outcome. The worst-case scenario would be the opposite, Slack gaining ground and Atlassian falling over the coming months. If the two stocks move predominantly in the same direction of the market, I believe Atlassian outperforms Slack whether the market moves higher or lower.I would suggest a timed exit on this trade rather than a target price for either stock. I think a six-month period would be optimal and that is based on the timing of the next couple of quarters of earnings reports. Atlassian should report earnings again in the last couple of weeks of April. That is based on previous reports because there isn't a set date for earnings to release on the company's website.By pairing a bullish trade on Atlassian with a bearish trade on Slack, this should lower some of the risk associated with another sharp move down by the overall market."

This software together with Confluence makes up approximately two thirds of its revenue. Its customer base ranges from small organizations to ""over two-thirds of the Fortune 500"".However, its business model is less sticky than it first appears. Only 50% of its total revenue is derived from subscription revenues, and contracts are mostly on monthly or yearly terms.Given all the uncertainty facing its customers, I do not believe investors paying more than 200 times forward earnings and 20 times forward sales will be rewarded in this stock. Here's why:That's the question on everyone's mind and I wish to address it here:(Source)The first aspect to notice in the graph above is that over time, the amount of revenue from sources outside of subscriptions appears to be increasing, namely maintenance, perpetual license, and other sources - from 45% in Q1 2019 to 50% as of its most recent results. Please note this spans just five quarters. Note: Atlassian does not provide these figures before Q1 2019.However, we can see enough to understand that a significant portion of Atlassian's revenues is coming from outside of subscription-based revenues.Indeed, looking through the Risk Factors in the annual report, it states (page 12):So this is critical to my bearish thesis. Even while acknowledging that there's a huge amount of evidence that Atlassian's products are impressive:Source: Product ReviewSource: Product ReviewThe above websites post raving reviews about Atlassian's products. I do not argue that they are not impressive products.My argument here is squarely focused over two aspects facing investors:Noted below is Atlassian's guidance for June 2020:(Source)Even if we take the highest end of its tight revenue guidance, we can see that Atlassian's revenue is expected to grow by close to 32% year-over-year. Given its valuation (I'll come to it shortly), we can see that Atlassian's revenue growth rates are decelerating before coronavirus caused many non-essential businesses to temporarily close their doors.This is important, so I'll repeat it: slightly more than 33% of Atlassian's total revenues are derived from sources outside of a subscription business model. These are perpetual licenses (one-off sales) and maintenance sales. In the annual report, it states on page 12:Given the lack of visibility many businesses now face, I question whether Atlassian's customer retention is as strong as investors believe it to be, given that management itself finds it difficult to predict.Next, the only reason why Atlassian is able to guide to finish fiscal 2020 with revenue growth rates of 32% boils down to the fact that it started H1 2020 strongly, by reporting revenue growth rates of approximately 37% compared with the same period in H1 2019 (please see blue bars below):Source: Author's calculationsNonetheless, its growth rates have already been steadily decelerating without having to factor in coronavirus closing down many businesses.Atlassian is priced with a market cap of $33 billion, with slowing revenue growth rates and priced at 20x forward sales. On an IFRS basis, given its exorbitant stock-based compensation, in the best case, it's likely to finish fiscal 2020 at $0.54:This puts the stock trading at approximately 266 times forward earnings.As the market took fright and sold off this past couple of months, Atlassian's share price recovered incredibly fast. This demonstrates that the market clearly believes that this is a superior business with a strong suite of products that are being underpriced. Even though it presently struggles for IFRS profitability, the market believes this is an undervalued business.Also, its free cash flow progress:Source: Q4 2019 Press StatementWe can see that Atlassian improved its free cash flow profile dramatically over the course of a year, so there's a potential for the company to grow its free cash flow further as its growth rates start to mature.Ultimately, I struggle to find a reason to be bullish this stock. Even if its products are impressive, as I've acknowledged they are, given that it's priced at such a hefty forward multiple both on a P/Sales and P/earnings basis, I believe there's just too much risk involved. Particularly, when we consider the large bargain opportunities available elsewhere."

This out-performance was mainly due to the combination of market turmoil and the current need for many employees to work from home. I believe that Atlassian has demonstrated a strong track record of growth. However, at $129, it is overvalued by 21% based on my base-case assumptions.(Source: Seeking Alpha data)(Source: Google)Atlassian reported an 18.8% year-on-year growth in customers, from 138,235 to 164,790. This was driven by a 10x increase in Confluence cloud customers. In total, Confluence has attained 60,000 customers. This highlights how the workforce shift towards the cloud has likely helped Atlassian gain more customers. In addition, Trello also has more than 50M users, an increase from 19M since the acquisition three years ago. According to Atlassian's latest shareholder letter, Trello is now used by teams across 80% of the Fortune 500.(Source: Q2 Earnings Presentation)Despite the 18% customer growth, Atlassian has been able to grow revenues at 36.7% year on year from $299M to $409M. This shows that Atlassian has been able to generate more revenue from each customer, which indicates that customers find great value in its products. (Source: Q2 Earnings Presentation)At a customer base of 164K, Atlassian still has a long runway for growth. In its latest shareholder letter, the company indicated that its total addressable market reaches 100M when it includes all the technical professionals. This means that it has only penetrated 0.1% of its potential target professionals.(Source: Q2 Shareholder Letter)To ensure that smaller companies like Atlassian do not run into liquidity issues, one way to determine that is to monitor its cash and debt balances, as well as its cash-burn rate.Looking at its latest balance sheet, Atlassian has $1.2B of cash and $697M of short-term investments with no debt. Since Atlassian's net free cash flow was $202M in the latest quarter, this provides a large cushion for Atlassian to invest in growth. It also helps the company tide through any operational difficulties in a volatile period.(Source: Q2 Shareholder Letter)In an economic downturn, customers might cut back on non-essential services to conserve cash flow. If these businesses deem that Atlassian is not crucial to their operations, it might lead to a larger-than-expected churn rate for the company.Atlassian also faces competition in its space that may lead to slower customer adoption on its platform. Some of these competitors include Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) GitHub, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), and Amazon's AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN) Marketplace. Atlassian has to ensure that its platform continues to delight customers to gain market share and keep them from switching over to competitors.1) Revenue growth at 30% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect Atlassian's track record of high sales growth and its ability to penetrate its total addressable market. However, intense competition and a lack of product innovation might put a lid on high sales growth in the future as Atlassian continues to expand its offering.2) Operating margin of 35% from 2026 onwards. Software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Atlassian's gross margins have remained above 80% since 2015. Once Atlassian scales further and profitability becomes a priority, the company should experience a high level of operating margin expansion through operating leverage. However, if Atlassian has to incur higher customer acquisition costs due to strong competition, there could be some downward pressure on its margins in the near term.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Atlassian will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) Atlassian has an initial weighted cost of capital of 9%, which drops to 8% in the terminal year. The higher cost of capital reflects the higher risk of Atlassian having negative operating income and losing money. However, once the company achieves profitability and higher free cash flows, the risk should be reduced as reflected in the lower cost of capital.(Source: Author creation using Atlassian's financials) (Figures are in $millions except per share data and percentages)The value I derived for Atlassian is roughly $24.4B for the entire company. This represents a 21% downside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high-growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $101 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against other software companies.(Source: Author creation using data from Seeking Alpha)Compared to other peers, Atlassian is expensive. Even though it has similar growth rates as ServiceNow, it is much more expensive in terms of Price/Sales and EV/sales ratio. Atlassian is more expensive than Slack, which has a stronger growth rate but worse operating margins.Potential investors have to decide if they believe Atlassian will be able to execute better than my base-case assumptions in the long run. If investors expect competition to turn out to be weaker than expected and push up Atlassian's future sales growth for an extended period, the recent pullback might make Atlassian a buy."

The company's revenue growth of 37% and a similar free cash flow margin spell out just how successful it is.I must confess that I have had a really difficult time in assessing this company. On the one hand, Atlassian has tremendous fundamentals and the stock appears to be in breakout mode.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)On the other hand, I see headwinds in the future that could knock the stock down a notch, at least in the short term. In the long term, I expect further greatness from this company.My basic problem with Atlassian in the short term is that the stock valuation is only justifiable based on future earnings. Its future sales multiple is very overvalued. But there are issues that will play out in Q3 and the remainder of the year that could potentially reduce margins and hence reduce earnings. This should translate into a lower stock price.For this reason, I am giving Atlassian a ""Neutral"" rating.The following scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth illustrates Atlassian's stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. As can be seen from the chart, Atlassian is extremely overvalued relative to its peers.While this chart indicates that Atlassian is overvalued, I arrive at a different conclusion when I look at next year's earnings estimates instead of sales estimates.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)This second scatter plot that is based on earnings estimates shows that the company is actually fairly valued.My interpretation is that Atlassian stock price is driven by anticipated earnings, not by the forward sales multiple. And the anticipated earnings are huge. Any disappointment could send the stock tumbling.There are several issues that could potentially affect Atlassian's performance in Q3 and the rest of the year.Recent Price HikeThe most prominent issue is related to the recent price hike in data center products. This resulted in a pull-forward of revenue into Q2.In addition to revenue being pulled forward, I expect that the price hike may result in some customer churn.Revenue HeadwindCompany management has indicated that the proportion of subscription revenue relative to the overall revenue mix is increasing. Therefore, an increasing proportion of revenue will be recognized over time, rather than upfront.Rising DebtAtlassian has been achieving its stellar revenue growth partially through M&A activity. But that comes at a price. The company's total debt level has been ramping up fast.(Source: Portfolio123)It is not only the debt level but the debt-to-equity ratio that investors need to keep an eye on. For Atlassian, the total debt-to-equity has ramped up from 0 to 1.3 in 1 1/2 years.(Source: Portfolio123)This debt has to be serviced, of course. Not only will this eat into margins, but the high level of debt may curtail future M&A activity to some extent. Either that or there will be shareholder dilution.R&D InvestmentCompany management indicated that they were unable to hire R&D staff according to plan, as mentioned in this excellent Seeking Alpha article:I expect that the R&D shortfall will result in one of two possibilities: (1) increased share-based compensation; or (2) increased M&A activity. The latter option will likely result in shareholder dilution due to the high level of debt that was mentioned previously.Atlassian is a superb high-growth company with a promising future. That being said, I have some concerns regarding its short-term performance that could cause the stock price to fall from its current valuation.The stock is being valued by the market based on anticipated earnings, not on sales multiple. There are several issues that could impact earnings in the coming quarters. These issues include:In order to sustain historical levels of revenue growth, Atlassian may look to M&A activity. Given the high level of debt, such actions would likely result in shareholder dilution.For the above reasons, I am giving Atlassian a ""Neutral"" rating."
4322858,41961,2020-02-10T13:18:23-05:00,"Atlassian has a dominant foothold on IT Collaboration and Project Management.The company has returned 74% annualized over the last 3 years.Atlassian's Q2 was solid, with the business delivering 37% revenue growth and almost 50% free cash flow to revenue.Current valuation is one of the few things not to like for new investors considering an entry.","I first came across Atlassian (TEAM) shortly before its IPO. I was intrigued by something quite notable that was detailed in its S1, which was that a customer spending $1 in Year 1 would eventually end up spending almost $7 in Year 5 as a result of adding more users over time, with users consuming more products and renewing existing licenses. It occurred to me that while Atlassian was a gem of a business, the key was to be able to snag it when it came on sale. Unfortunately, I missed the IPO and it spiked to a level that was more than I was willing to pay. I got my chance in Q2 2016 when the market suffered some indigestion, and it's been a profitable association ever since. Atlassian is a current holding of my Project $1M portfolio.Atlassian provides enterprise collaboration software for businesses ranging from SMBs all the way up to large Enterprises. The company’s most notable software offering is the IT project management tool Jira, which allows developers to track bug fixes and other development priorities from initiation to completion. The business was founded in 2002 and was listed in 2015. Atlassian has a $36B market capitalization. The company did approximately $1.1 billion in revenue in 2019 and has returned just under 60% annualized to investors over the last three yearsBest in Class Collaboration software for development teamsAtlassian’s Jira product is the industry standard software for development teams in project management. The software allows development teams to track bug fixes, development items and roadmap items, prioritize, implement and ultimately resolve them. Software developers often couple the deployment of Jira with Confluence, Atlassian‘s collaboration tool.Atlassian’s project management software and devops tools tend to be very sticky once deployed. Once deployed, the experience has been that the adoption and usage of the software tends to be fairly extensive amongst entire engineering and product management teams. Developers, product managers, QA and other software professionals live and breathe daily within Jira to manage full cycles of software development and deployment. This includes the priority management for feature, bug fixes and other elements of new and existing releases. The loss of productivity and potential project management hiccups in switching out to a new software is generally perceived as just not worth the risk. There also tends to be a new learning curve and on-ramp with any alternate project management software.Atlassian estimated the market size for project management software to be over $60 billion in its S1, with estimated potential users of over 900M knowledge workers and a typical sweet spot amongst technical teams. These technical teams include software developers and others involved in the project management process.What's also unique about Atlassian is that unlike most SaaS businesses, Atlassian has a product first, development first culture and underinvests in a direct sales presence. This results in strong virality and cult-like adoption of its products by developers who in turn advocate for the business via word of mouth to other developers. What's interesting about this is that its low-touch sales channel has resulted in a robust online distribution model, which results in significantly better unit economics as the business scales, producing strong margins and strong cash flow.Not having to scale a direct sales team for revenue growth has allowed Atlassian to fix significantly more of its costs than would be typical. It spends less than 25% of revenue on Sales and Marketing expense. The other benefit of a product-oriented approach is the creation of a brand with authenticity amongst the tech community, leading to a thriving ecosystem of developers. This has led to Atlassian having a robust marketplace for applications that are built on Jira and Confluence, which generates almost 20% of Atlassian’s revenues, or more than $250M.Atlassian's focus on IT Project management is also likely to lead to some resiliency in revenues in the event of any economic downturn. While the business hasn't been tested yet with any negative economic conditions, the fact that the software tools are used to manage business-critical projects and priorities and keep them on track, coupled with the fact that its software offerings are generally more economical than competitive offerings should lead to high retention even in depressed economic conditions.Project management becomes a beachhead for other opportunitiesLike other SaaS businesses such as ServiceNow (NOW) and Veeva (VEEV), the initial deployment of mission-critical software product typically lends itself to a beachhead in the enterprise from which these businesses can then land and expand. In Atlassian’s case, project management software is giving rise to the opportunity to push a technical help desk product. Atlassian recognized this opportunity with the 2013 introduction of the Jira service desk, a workflow solution that is able to manage the scheduling and coordination of issues lists with prioritization, owner assignment and ticketing logic.The main market opportunities that Atlassian has pursued with Jira Service Desk have been IT helpdesk functionality, call centre, HR and other compliance systems. The introduction of this product brings Atlassian into selective competition with ServiceNow as far as this functionality is concerned. While ServiceNow has a sweet spot in the IT helpdesk of large enterprises, Atlassian is finding a market in smaller and midmarket enterprise for Jira Service Desk. The product is not as full-featured as ServiceNow, nor is it as expensive. The deployment of a suite of complementary products such as Jira, Jira Service Desk and Confluence reinforce Atlassian‘s hold and dominance within a given enterprise, increasing its stickiness and overall retention of clients.Atlassian is in hyper-growth mode, and investing significant resources in customer acquisition. Given this is the case the business is not optimizing for profitability at this point and is ultra-focused on top line growth.Source: Atlassian Q1 Investor ReportThe company most recently reported revenue growth of over 37% year on year in its latest results and handily beat revenue guidance, delivering $409M in revenue for the quarter. Results were strong across most facets of the business, and revenue growth actually showed a sequential improvement on Q1. Source: Atlassian Q1 Investor ReportAtlassian increased customers year on year by almost 20%, with total customers increasing to 164,790. It was subscription revenue which once again powered the business, with customers looking into lock-in subscriptions before planned pricing increases which are due to take effect during the year.Source: Atlassian Q1 Investor ReportAtlassian's strong scalability and low-cost distribution model was fairly stunningly illustrated in the company's attainment of free cash flow. Atlassian has fairly consistently delivered 30% of free cash flow to revenue, however, the almost 50% of free cash flow to revenue in Q2 was unusual, even for this business and unlikely to be repeated going forward. Q2's higher than expected number was primarily driven by an inability to hire R&D talent as aggressively as expected, with some sales & marketing expenses also being deferred.Atlassian also reaffirmed its forecast of revenue growth of $1.59-$1.6B, or around 32-33% revenue growth.Unfortunately, for any new investors considering this great business, the current valuation is one of the things not to like. Atlassian currently trades at a Price to Sales ratio of 25x Sales. This is close to the highest that the business has traded at for the last 5 years. Somewhere close to 20x Sales, the level it traded at briefly in December 2019 and a level closer to its 5-year average would be a level that may be more appropriate for starting an accumulation of Atlassian."

Don’t buy the stock.","Shares of Atlassian (TEAM) were in the spotlight once again after the company reported its Q2 of fiscal 2020, beating the street by $19 million on revenues and $0.10 on earnings per share.Beyond beating analyst estimates, the market seemed to be pleased with a slight revenue growth acceleration from 36% in Q1 to 37% in Q2, along with market-leading profitability margins. In fact, the stock reached an all-time high of $150.71 the day after the release, representing an increase of 13% from its pre-earnings close.(finviz.com)Other highlights from the quarter include, the departure of the company’s President Jay Simons (a fact that the market may have overlooked in the growth acceleration euphoria) and the Atlassian Marketplace surpassing $1 billion in lifetime revenues.On top of all this, the valuation remains dangerously high at ~20x forward revenues. Don’t buy TEAM.(Investor Presentation)Q2 2020 was a surprisingly strong quarter for TEAM, with acceleration in revenue growth and massive profitability margins:(Shareholder Letter)It is a relief for investors (amid growing worries about growth deceleration in the SaaS space) to watch TEAM go back to acceleration mode. As shown in the chart below, the revenue growth didn’t change in Q1 2020, after decelerating from 39% in Q2 2019 to 36% in Q4 of the same fiscal year. But now it is again in the 37%, accelerating one point sequentially.(Investor Presentation)Also, billings were strong at $486.5 million for the quarter, representing a growth of 38.5% Y/Y and 23.2% Q/Q. The growth in billings is indicative of revenue growth durability, so TEAM could be well positioned for a few quarters of +30% revenue growth.Besides delivering on total revenues, TEAM keeps growing subscription revenues at 50% Y/Y (three quarters in a row), while, at the same time, showing no signs of material deceleration in other sources of revenues:(Investor Presentation)During the quarter, the company added around 5,000 customers, and now has almost 165,000, growing the figure at an annual rate of 19% Y/Y. This rate is one point below that of the previous quarter, but is significantly strong for such a scale. Speaking of scale, the Atlassian Marketplace surpassed $1 billion in lifetime revenues during Q2 2020. This marketplace is a value mine of possible acquisition targets for TEAM and a source of revenues that is constantly growing between 30% and 60% every quarter.The management mentioned on the earnings call that it fell short of expectations regarding R&D expenses. In fact, the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue fell to 42% from 48.4% in Q1 2020. This decline, along with similar declines on S&M and G&A margins, helped the bottom line soar enough to impress the market. To be precise, the operating margin was 10% (31% non-IFRS) and the free cash flow margin was 49%. Keep in mind that very few public SaaS companies feature profitability margins like these. The charts below illustrate the recent performance of these metrics:(Investor Presentation)(Investor Presentation)In normal conditions, investors would be cheerful about the margin expansion. But the reason behind this one is not so encouraging. The fact that the management fell short on R&D expenses is a yellow flag pertaining to hiring. See, a differentiating factor for TEAM is its level of spending in R&D relative to the overall SaaS sector.While most SaaS companies use to spend (relative to revenues) ~40% and ~20% on S&M and R&D, respectively, TEAM has an opposite model, with most of its operating expenses located on R&D, and the least on S&M (roughly 45% and 18% of revenues, respectively). See these charts from the company’s 2019 investor session for a graphical comparison (it uses non-IFRS figures):(2019 Investor Session Presentation)As the significance of R&D for TEAM is greater than for other companies, a related issue may be critical for its future growth. Indeed, TEAM could not hire technical staff as it expected during the quarter. If the company is not able to grow its R&D team in tandem with the top line, the growth of the latter may decline faster than expected. Here is the co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brooks answering a related question on the earnings call:(Q2 2020 Earnings Call)In conclusion, enjoy the numbers - you may not see them again in some time. This is just a taste of what TEAM is capable of with its operational leverage at maturity, but this is not the time for these numbers.In my last article on TEAM, I argued that the company – which sold off on the Q1 2020 results – had good results and that it was a buy for long-term investors because of the weakness. This time, I think that the market overreacted on past numbers, but by-passed management guidance for future numbers.To begin, the management stated that this quarter was better than expected (even for itself), and that it expected revenues to decrease sequentially from $409 million in Q2 to $395-399 million in Q3. It would mark sort of an inflection point as it would be the first time (publicly speaking) that TEAM delivers a sequentially negative growth quarter.That guidance represents a growth of -3% Q/Q and a disappointing 28% Y/Y – a 900-bps deceleration in just a quarter. On top of that, the operating margin is expected to retreat some points to -8% in that quarter. See the table below for more details.(Investor Presentation)Besides the unfavorable outlook, the company announced that its President Jay Simons is leaving on July, and failed to mention a replacement. Didn’t the market see this? Ask ServiceNow (NOW) what happened the last time it announced such a change. Big selloff! And, at least NOW had a replacement.In my opinion, there is no doubt that investors are watching high-growth software stocks with better eyes in the start of 2020, and TEAM has been infected by that enthusiasm.With TEAM ending January at $147 a share, the valuation is at a massive 20x forward EV/S. I guess that investors may find TEAM as a less risky option than other SaaS stocks growing in the 30s, or are just expecting revenue growth above 30% for some years from now.Those are fairly high hopes, especially when you have cheaper names on TEAM’s growth cohort – Zendesk (ZEN), DocuSign (DOCU), Avalara (AVLR), or even NOW – or better options for 20x (or less) forward revenues -- Anaplan (PLAN), Alteryx (AYX), Okta (OKTA) or Coupa Software (COUP). Although, I must point out that the profitability profile of TEAM is worth a premium over some of these cheaper names.Another way of seeing the overvaluation of TEAM is by looking at where the company’s revenues are heading to. With this level of growth, TEAM will soon have revenues similar to those of Splunk (SPLK), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Workday (WDAY) or NOW. This group is trading in the range of 6-15x forward revenues. So you can arrive to your own conclusions.Don’t buy TEAM. The slight revenue growth acceleration of Q2 will be followed by substantial deceleration in Q3 and Q4 (and even negative sequential growth in Q3). The whopping profitability margins will normalize. The company seems to have a hard time hiring R&D staff. It has a top management member leaving at the end of the fiscal year, which the market seemed to embrace given the strong results. And the stock seems to be substantially overvalued at 20x forward revenues."

The company reported a very strong Q2 earnings with revenue growth of 37% compared to expectations for only ~30% growth. In addition, billings and EPS were nicely ahead of expectations, as the company was able to significantly expand margins during the quarter.The strong quarter led to TEAM raising the full-year revenue guidance by ~$30 million, which was more than the Q2 revenue beat. In addition, operating margin guidance was raised, though still seems slightly conservative.Data by YChartsAfter the strong earnings report, the company saw its stock pop 10% following earnings. Even though I am a long-term believer in the company's fundamental and financials, I believe the current 22x forward revenue valuation is a bit extreme for the time being. In order to justify this premium valuation, investors would need to expect revenue growth coming in at 35% during FY20 (current guidance is ~32%) and another 30%+ revenue growth in FY21. While I believe this is possible, I believe the law of large numbers and the near $2 billion run-rate in revenue could make this challenging.Valuation has become a bit too much for my liking and I will wait for a better opportunity to buy some shares. I believe the company will remain at a premium valuation for many years to come, but history has shown software companies with 20x+ revenue multiples tend to contract if there is a soft spot in the market.Revenue during the quarter was very impressive at 37% growth to $409 million, well above expectations for only ~30% growth. Expectations for the quarter were for revenue of $389 million, and the Q2 revenue acceleration broke the trend of recent quarter's decelerating revenue growth.Source: Company PresentationSubscription revenue continues to drive the company's growth, as investors love to see this revenue stream remain healthy. Given the high visibility related to subscription revenue, investors tend to place a higher valuation multiple on companies that are able to generate a majority of their revenue via subscriptions. During Q2, subscription revenue grew 50% to $229 million. This revenue stream now represents ~55% of the total company revenue and tends to come with higher operating margins.Billings were also very strong during the quarter and came in at $486 million, which was much better than consensus expectations for ~$430 million. While some of the billings strength can be attributed to better pricing impacts, the dollar value of billings remains well above the dollar value of revenue, signaling a strong backlog of potential future growth.Source: Company PresentationEven as the company continues to mature and has seen its revenue growth rates fluctuate over the past several quarters, investors can't deny the strong operating margins during the quarter. The company reported $125 million in operating profit, which represents a ~31% operating margin, up significantly from the 25% margin in the year ago period.Two of the main drivers of the better operating margins during the quarter were some increased pricing impacts over the last few quarters and the strong subscription revenue growth, which comes at higher margins. I believe over time, the company will continue to drive margin expansion via gaining more scale and better leveraging its expense base. In addition, the company's ability to expand margins gives it more flexibility in terms of investing into growth opportunities, such as international markets.The very strong revenue beat combined with significant margin expansion led to EPS during the quarter of $0.37 compared to expectations for $0.27.Source: Company PresentationDuring Q3, the company expects revenue of $395-399 million, which represents ~28% growth at the midpoint and was pretty close to expectations for ~$397 million. While gross margin guidance remains healthy at ~85%, operating margin guidance of ~16% seems slightly conservative given the recent strength in margin expansion.For the full year, management raised its revenue guidance to $1,590-1,600 million, up from $1,560-1,574 million. The new revenue guidance represents ~32% growth at the midpoint and the ~$30 million revenue raise was more than the Q2 revenue beat, demonstrating continued strength in its operations.Operating margin guidance was also raised to ~21-22% compared to the previous guidance of ~20%. While Q2 operating margin came in at 31%, this implies lower operating margin for the remainder of the year, which could be slightly conservative considering operating margin was ~18% in Q3/Q4 last year and the company has done a good job expanding margins. EPS guidance was also raised to $1.03-1.09 which was above expectations for ~$1.02.The company's Q2 earnings report provided upside to nearly all financial metrics investors pay attention to. Revenue growth was surprisingly strong at 37% and was well above expectations. In addition to the much better than expected revenue growth, operating margins showed some significant expansion.Nevertheless, the company's valuation continues to rise. After the strong Q2 earnings report, the stock popped an immediate 10% as valuation was again pushed higher. Even though the company is firing on all cylinders and the momentum is nearly all bullish, I have become more concerned around valuation.Data by YChartsOver the past year, the company's high-point in terms of forward revenue valuation was ~25x, and with the stock trading at ~22x forward revenue now, I think investors should start to place more emphasis on valuation.The company has a current market cap of $35.85 billion, and with ~1.95 billion of cash/investments and ~$0.9 million of debt, it has a current enterprise value of ~$34.8 billion. Management recently raised its full-year revenue guidance to $1,590-1,600 million, which represents ~32% growth for the full year. Even if this proves to be slightly conservative, which I believe the company will beat this guidance, forward revenue valuation of ~22x is expensive.The company is quickly approaching a $2 billion run-rate revenue, and with growth of ~35%, it does not seem plausible that this growth will continue over the next several quarters. In fact, with revenue growth of 36-37% through the first two quarters and full-year guidance of ~32% growth, this implies revenue growth decelerating rather significantly for the remainder of the year.If we assume revenue comes in ahead of management's current guidance and ends the year closer to $1.65 billion, we can start to build out expectations for FY21. This would imply revenue growth of ~35% during the year, and we can expect revenue growth to decelerate in FY21. Assuming ~30% growth, we could see FY21 revenue of ~$2.15 billion, which would imply a FY21 revenue multiple of ~16x.Even though ~16x multiple seems about right when looking at the above chart, investors would have to assume 30%+ revenue growth over the next year and a half. At that multiple, the stock would be about in line with other faster growth software names. I believe we could see slightly lower revenue growth as the company reaches scale and the law of large numbers kicks in.Although I am a long-term fan of the stock, I believe valuation has gotten slightly too high, especially after the 10%+ pop in the stock post Q2 earnings. For now, I am waiting for a better entry point, but note that investors should not be quick to sell out of their positions."

Last week, it reported a strong second quarter that beat estimates.For the second quarter, revenues grew 37% to $408.7 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $389 million. Net income was $124.1 million compared with $45.2 million a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.37, better than the market's forecast of $0.27.By segment, Subscription revenues grew 50% to $228.7 million and maintenance revenues grew 20% to $116.9 million. License revenue grew 13% to $29.1 million and other revenues increased 45% to $34.1 million. Total Billings grew 39% to $487 million, ahead of estimates of $431 million.It ended the quarter with 164,790 customers on an active subscription or maintenance agreement, adding almost 5,003 net new customers during the quarter, over 90% of which chose its cloud products. It had added 7,060 customers in Q1. The slower pace of new customer adds is most likely due to the introduction of free editions of the company cloud products.For the third quarter, Atlassian expects revenues to grow 31-32% to $395-399 million with an adjusted EPS of $0.20. It expects to end the current year with revenues of $1.59-1.60 billion and an EPS of $1.03-1.09.Atlassian's Marketplace has reached a massive scale, recently surpassing $1 billion in lifetime sales. It is now one of the largest enterprise software marketplaces alongside AWS and Salesforce. To boost its efforts, Atlassian, in December, announced Forge, its new cloud app development platform. Forge makes it easier and faster to develop cloud apps by providing compute, storage, security, and ready-made UI components. Forge is built on Amazon Web Service's Lambda serverless function-as-a-service (FaaS) platform that also helps in managing infrastructure and elements such as authentication, identity, and scaling.Forge is expected to increase the number of third-party cloud apps available on the Marketplace, creating more value for cloud customers. There are currently over 4,000 apps available on the Marketplace. In addition, developers have built 28,000 apps for their in-house teams. Across Jira Software and Confluence, over 60% of customer instances use at least one Marketplace app.During the quarter, Atlassian announced template releases for Trello and Jira Service Desk. Trello Board, Card and Community Templates - Teams can now get started on Trello with over 100 pre-loaded board templates. They can also now share and create both board and card templates with other teams. Companies like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), SurveyMonkey, and The Telegraph have created templates for use cases including sales forecasts, editorial calendars, and project management.The new Jira Service Desk Templates are built for HR, legal, and facilities teams. The templates make it easier for general business teams to manage tasks including employee onboarding, maintenance requests, and contract negotiations.Atlassian's long-term goal is to engage 100 million active users. During the quarter, Confluence reached 60,000 customers! Over the past year, it has added over 10x more Confluence cloud than on-premises customers. Trello crossed over 50 million registered users, up from 19 million at the time of its acquisition three years ago. Trello is now used by teams across 80% of the Fortune 500.According to a recent MarketsandMarkets report, the global enterprise collaboration market size is projected to grow from $31 billion in 2019 to $48.1 billion by 2024 at a CAGR of 9.2%.

This article was highlighted under our Tech vertical. Find out how you can get access to the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Atlassian (TEAM), a software company best known for its team collaboration and workflow tools, has just reported Q2 results, and its shares have rocketed up nearly ~10% in post-market trading on the news: reversing a decline of the same magnitude last quarter. Investors have cheered Atlassian's recovery in revenue growth rates (or at the very least, the comforting fact that revenue growth didn't continue to decelerate) in the face of heightened competition from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and ServiceNow (NOW), which are equally well-known platforms.Data by YChartsThere's no doubt that Atlassian is a rare story in the software sector. Despite nearing a ~$2 billion annual revenue run rate, Atlassian has managed to stabilize revenue growth in the mid-30% range (for comparison, Workday (WDAY) is at a slightly larger scale, but growth has stepped down to the mid-20s), proving the wide breadth of its total addressable market. Atlassian has also managed to chase growth in a profitable fashion - though some large-caps like Salesforce.com (CRM) have perennially struggled to improve operating margins no matter how large it got, Atlassian has done a fantastic job at gradually boosting its margins and growing free cash flow.There's only one arrow in Atlassian's heel, and that's its monstrous valuation, which is not helped by the fact that Atlassian shares have risen ~25% over the past quarter. In effect, all this outperformance on both the growth and profitability front are likely already priced into Atlassian's share price. As we saw in Q1, even the slightest misstep can cause huge volatility in Atlassian shares. My view on Atlassian remains largely unchanged: despite strong fundamentals, I'm not willing to pay a near-20x forward revenue multiple for this stock. Especially as the market reaches historic heights and the S&P 500's valuation multiples stretch beyond prior averages, I'm more keen on rotating my portfolio into more defensive names.In this article, I'll update on Atlassian's latest metrics and its resulting valuation - but on the whole, investors would be wise to note Atlassian's overvalued status and invest elsewhere.The first thing to point out about Atlassian's second-quarter earnings is that its revenue growth has accelerated ever so slightly, breaking a trend of disappointing deceleration from the prior two quarters. Take a look at the company's growth trends in the chart below:Figure 1. Atlassian growth trendsSource: Atlassian Q2 earnings releaseTotal revenues of $408.7 million (+37% y/y) massively beat out over Wall Street's expectations of $389.4 million (+30% y/y) by a seven-point margin, so it's a small surprise that shares reacted as they did.The good news doesn't end there: Atlassian also significantly raised its revenue guidance for the remainder of FY20. Atlassian is now projecting full-year revenues of $1.59-$1.60 billion, a ~$30 million bump versus a prior revenue range of $1.56-$1.57 billion that also represents roughly two additional points of revenue growth in the full year.Figure 2. Atlassian guidance updateSource: Atlassian Q2 earnings releaseMike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian's newly-elevated co-CEO (serving alongside founder Scott Farquhar), noted that Atlassian's success in maintaining growth rates in the mid-30s owes a lot to the company's platform strategy. Like Salesforce, Atlassian has found tremendous success in building a wide ecosystem of third-party apps around its core platform, and Atlassian's App Store has driven plenty of incremental revenue. Per his prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:Growth in Atlassian's platform revenues have helped to offset a softer contribution percentage from the company's older perpetual license deals.It's not just on the top line that Atlassian is winning, however. As previously noted, Atlassian has been able to drive growth in tandem with profitability improvements, which is exactly what we'd expect out of a maturing software company. See the company's operating margin trends below:Figure 3. Atlassian operating margin trendsSource: Atlassian Q2 earnings releaseAtlassian drove $125 million in pro forma operating profits this quarter, nearly 2x the prior year, while pro forma margins improved six points to 31%.Free cash flow, likewise, rose in kind: growing 64% y/y to $202 million and representing an all-time high FCF margin of 49%. In the press release accompanying Atlassian's Q4 results, founder Scott Farquhar noted that Q2 represented ""record profitability and cash flow"":Figure 4. Atlassian FCF trendsSource: Atlassian Q2 earnings releaseThis strength is expected to carry out into FY20, with Atlassian's guidance also calling for 21-22% pro forma operating margin (one to two points higher than a prior view of 20%).Having now seen Atlassian's latest numbers, I'll take you back to the original question: to what extent is Atlassian's outperformance already priced into its shares? In my view, it's the entirety.At Atlassian's post-earnings share price of ~$145, the company has a market cap of $35.54 billion. After netting out Atlassian's $1.24 billion of cash against $0.87 billion of debt, we arrive at an enterprise value of $35.17 billion.Over the trailing twelve months, Atlassian has generated $1.42 billion in revenues. If we apply a ~29% y/y growth rate to this number (consistent with Atlassian's implied guidance growth rate in the second half of FY20 - an aggressive assumption given growth should decelerate further in the first half of FY21), we arrive at a forward twelve-month revenue projection of $1.83 billion. This gives Atlassian a gargantuan valuation multiple of 19.2x EV/FTM revenues. And unsurprisingly, this lodges Atlassian up against some of the most expensive names in the software sector (with higher-valued names Coupa (COUP) and Okta (OKTA) each currently growing at ten points faster than Atlassian):Data by YChartsTo me, this is a clear signal that Atlassian's gains are capped, especially in a market reversal situation that punishes high-flying names. Though Atlassian's strong fundamentals and revenue acceleration from Q2 prevent me from being too bearish on the company, the fact that Atlassian is trading at a richer multiple of revenues than most S&P 500 companies are as a multiple of earnings makes me neutral at best."

Maintenance revenue grew by 20% while license revenue was up 12%. Other revenue mostly comprising of fees from sales of third-party apps in the Atlassian marketplace grew 36%.Going forward, management is guiding for revenue growth of approx. 42% in Q2 '20, and 31% in FY '20.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Improved product portfolio, rapid revenue growth, price optimization, and strategic acquisitions explain management's value generation strategy. Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Atlassian's margins have worsened over the years due to its rapid pursuit of market share. The pursuit of market share can't be faulted as the cloud market has expanded rapidly in the past five years. Prior to that, Atlassian used to be a profitable player in its niche. Going forward, management is guiding for a ramp in R&D spend to beef up its product portfolio.Cash flow from operations is driven by changes in working capital and stock-based compensation offset by negative earnings. Acquisitions and investments in marketable securities have driven cash flow from investing activities. Cash flow from financing activities has been driven by debt issuance.Atlassian has cash of $1.77 billion and a debt of $1.14 billion on its balance sheet. At a debt to equity ratio of 164% and a current ratio of 0.94, Atlassian's balance sheet isn't the most attractive. As a result, I remain neutral on Atlassian's financials until profitability metrics improve.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Atlassian is trading at a discount to the average analysts' price target of $149. The Street has a revenue growth estimate of 30% in 2020 and 26% in 2021. This growth estimate will dilute the current lofty P/S ratio. At a market cap of nearly $30 billion, Atlassian seems expensive. Its market cap is a reflection of its ability to secure funding (equity value) rather than its true intrinsic value. Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Atlassian is trying to build a competitive moat around its products by building a platform with a high switching cost. This is an attractive value proposition that has attracted me to the stock. As more enterprises look to Jira, Trello, and Confluence to drive their workflow productivity, collaboration, and product go-to-market efficiency, Atlassian will become a fundamental part of the entire software ecosystem. This is why I'm convinced about Atlassian's value proposition as it is not overexposed to any singular cloud niche.Atlassian solidified its leadership in the enterprise planning tool after the acquisition of Agilecraft.Source: IDCThere are a lot of players in the collaboration space. This space is more congested, and Atlassian has little in competitive advantage.Compared to its peers, Atlassian has been able to attract more funds, which means it has more money to invest in sales and research. This has helped fuel its rapid product evolution both from internal product development and acquisitions. For example, it recently added security capabilities to its offerings. I expect this trend to continue to help Atlassian gain market share faster than competitors.A huge portion of Atlassian's valuation is a bet that its product pipeline will drive sustainable revenue. Some of these products face strong competition from other SaaS plays. This might impact Atlassian's ability to continue to raise pricing and grow market share. If the new product updates don't drive retention rate, optimism won't improve and valuation multiples won't expand.There have been multiple corrections in the cloud space, and a lot of cloud players still trade at lofty valuations to their projected revenue and cash flow. If there is a correction in the cloud space, Atlassian could be affected, given its 24M beta of 1.43.Source: AuthorI have a Hold rating with the hope of buying on a pullback.

Following carnage among high-growth recent IPOs, then reports of ""sales execution issues"" among many of last year's batch of IPOs (such as DocuSign (DOCU) and Pluralsight (PS)), and then even reports from some of the industry stalwarts like Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) that growth may hit some limits over the coming quarters, the cloud software sector hasn't been hit this hard since the broader market correction last November.Atlassian (TEAM) is no different. The Sydney-based software company, known best for its suite of work collaboration tools, has cratered more than 10% over the last week and is down more than 20% from its year-to-date highs, putting it in correction territory alongside many of its peers in the space:Data by YChartsThe question for investors now is: is Atlassian a ""buy the dip"" situation, or does the pullback appropriately reflect the fact that Atlassian has been trading at outsized valuation multiples for quite some time without much fundamental support?In my view, it's the latter. I'm a huge advocate of the buy-the-dip strategy among many growth stocks, but I view Atlassian's valuation as especially bloated in light of the fact that many of its enterprise software peers are now also trading 1-2 turns lower than they were last month. I'm partial to names like Workday, Elastic (ESTC), and Splunk (SPLK); but I'd hold off on buying Atlassian until the price comes down further.The core of the issue is Atlassian's guidance for FY20. At face value, Atlassian's outlook for the coming year actually came out on top of Wall Street's consensus. As shown in the slide below, taken from Atlassian's Q2 earnings deck, the company is pointing to $386-$390 million in revenue for the current quarter, representing +29-30% y/y growth (vs. Wall Street's consensus at $381.6 million, or +28% y/y growth). For the full year, Atlassian is guiding to $1.560-$1.574 billion in revenues (also +29-30% y/y growth, versus Wall Street's +28% y/y consensus):Figure 1. Atlassian guidance updateSource: Atlassian Q2 earnings deckBut the question is: is ~30% growth enough to justify Atlassian's monstrous valuation?Post-pullback, Atlassian is trading at a share price of ~$117, which indicates a market cap of $28.39 billion. After netting off $1.78 billion of cash and $862 million of debt on Atlassian's balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $27.47 billion. This represents an extremely heady valuation multiple of 17.5x EV/FY20 estimated revenues, based on the midpoint of Atlassian's guidance range for the current fiscal year.To Atlassian's credit, the company is a cash flow monster. In forecasting $465-$475 million of free cash flow for the year, Atlassian is projecting a rich ~30% FCF margin - which is quite favorable in a software sector laden with high-growth stocks that are burning cash to no end. But here's the problem: there are many mid and large-cap software stocks with a similar ~30% growth profile and similarly high FCF margins that trade at much lower multiples now. Workday and Splunk, for example - both growing in the ~30% range, and both stocks that I prefer in my portfolio over Atlassian - are both trading at sub-10x forward revenue multiples:Data by YChartsThe other point to note is that Atlassian's guidance implies serious deceleration in the year to come. In Q2, Atlassian generated 36% y/y revenue growth to $362.4 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $351.8 million (+32% y/y).Figure 2. Atlassian revenue trendsSource: Atlassian Q2 earnings deckThat's still a strong Q2 print. In his brief prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call, CEO Scott Farquhar noted that the company rolled out two new tiers of the company's flagship product, which have seen strong traction:You can read Atlassian's forecast for ~30% growth in two ways - either it's conservative, or it does imply some level of deceleration for the coming quarters. While the truth is likely a combination of the two, we can see over the past several quarters that Atlassian's subscription revenues have seen a marked slowdown in growth rates, from the mid/high-50s in FY19 to just 50% y/y now.The other point to make is that Atlassian's growth is becoming increasingly expensive to produce. Typically, we'd want to see software companies reduce their sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues, in a sign that the company is capable of achieving operating leverage with scale. Atlassian, on the other hand, spent 14.8% of its revenues (on a non-IFRS basis) on sales and marketing costs this quarter, up 150bps from 13.3% in the year-ago quarter. Investors typically praise Atlassian for having a light outside sales force that pushes down expenses relative to other large-cap software companies, but Atlassian's expense trends are headed in the wrong direction.While offset by a corresponding decline in R&D costs, Atlassian's increase in sales and marketing expenses did contribute to a compression in FCF margins to 17%, down eleven points from the year-ago quarter and the lowest point in the trailing twelve months:Figure 3. Atlassian FCFSource: Atlassian Q2 earnings deckMany software companies have become attractive buys after the recent sector-wide pullback, but in Atlassian's case, the company is still leagues ahead of its peers in its rich valuation multiple. At the same time, we're seeing growth rates begin to decline alongside weak free cash flow trends in the second quarter.In my view, this stock has further to fall. Steer clear and invest elsewhere."

The Australian-based company is scheduled to report fiscal first quarter results on Thursday and investors are looking for more positive results to move the stock even higher.Analysts expect Atlassian to report earnings of $0.24 per share on revenue of $351.8 million. The company reported earnings of $0.20 in the first quarter of 2019 on revenue of $267.29 million. If the estimates are accurate, it would represent earnings growth of 20% and revenue growth of 31.6%.Over the last three years, the company has seen earnings grow at a rate of 41% per year while revenue has grown by 39% per year. In the fourth quarter of 2019, earnings increased by 43% while revenue increased by 36%. Analysts expect earnings to grow by 17% in 2020 while revenue is expected to jump by 28.4%.The company's management efficiency measurements are well above average with a return on equity of 29.1% and a profit margin of 22.9%.All in all, the earnings growth, the revenue growth, the ROE, and the profit margin put Atlassian among the top-ranked companies in terms of its fundamental indicators.Looking at the weekly chart for Atlassian, there is a pattern that I noticed in the last few years. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the stock went through a consolidation phase in the $45 area and then it started trending higher within a trend channel. The stock broke above the upper rail of that channel in August 2018. The stock pulled back in the fourth quarter of 2018 and then went through a consolidation phase in the $70s. Once again, the stock started moving higher and a trend channel formed.The stock has just moved below the lower rail of the second trend channel and appears to be going through yet another consolidation period in the $120 to $140 range.The weekly stochastic readings have fallen sharply in the last two months and are approaching oversold territory. These indicators have only been lower than they are now on two occasions in the last three and a half years, in the fourth quarter of last year and in the fourth quarter of 2016. In fact, the only times these indicators have been below the 50-level has been in the fourth quarter of the last three years.It is also worth noting that the stock has been above its 52-week moving average since the beginning of 2017. The stock did dip down to the 52-week low last December before turning higher. The company went public in December 2015, so the 52-week moving average wasn't even available until December 2016. It has been above the trend line almost the entire time.Despite the strong fundamentals and the price performance, the sentiment toward Atlassian is pretty bearish. There are 22 analysts covering the stock at this time with 11 ""buy"" ratings and 11 ""hold"" ratings. This puts the buy percentage at 50% and that is well below average for all stocks, but especially low for a company with such strong fundamental and technical indicators.The short interest ratio for the stock is at 5.61 currently. This ratio is well above average and indicates more bearish sentiment. We see that the ratio has been elevated for quite some time now and has changed dramatically from time to time, but that has been due to the changes in the average daily trading volume. The number of shares sold short hit 8.4 million at the end of September and that is the second-highest reading in the last five months and the third highest reading of the past year.The put/call ratio is at 0.995 with 25,549 puts open and 25,666 calls open currently. This ratio falls in the average range and it is a tad lower than the reading on July 25 when the company last reported earnings.Overall, the sentiment shows that analysts are skeptical of Atlassian, short sellers are more pessimistic, and option traders are somewhat indifferent. To me, this indicates far more pessimism than should be directed toward the stock at this time.I am bullish on Atlassian and think the stock will move higher over the coming months. Even though I am bullish, I don't think you have to buy the stock ahead of the earnings report to benefit from the next bullish phase. Over the last four earnings reports, the stock has gapped higher twice and it has gapped lower twice. On the two instances where it gapped higher, the stock didn't really go anywhere in the next week. On the two occasions where it gapped lower, the stock started to rally within the next few weeks.I like the strong fundamentals and I like the fact that there is bearish sentiment toward the stock. I'm not crazy about the chart right now and can see the stock possibly moving a little lower after this earnings report and then starting yet another upward trend in the next week or two.If you want to be conservative, you could wait until the weekly stochastic readings make a bullish crossover. In each of the last three instances when the indicators were below the 50 level and then made a bullish crossover, the stock gained over 100% within the next year.If this pattern plays out again, it would mean the stock had moved to the $250 to $260 level - at least based on where the stock is currently. If the stock moves lower after earnings and dips down closer to the 52-week moving average, the stock would need to reach the $225 to $230 range to double."

While Atlassian remains a great long-term investment, I believe valuations are still a little elevated at the current moment as investors are not as willing as before to pay high premiums for fast growth software names.Source: YChartsRevenue and billings growth both remain very healthy, and the company's recent price increase could lead to further upside to revenue estimates over the next few quarters. However, with the stock trading around ~16x management's full-year guidance, I am hesitant to put new money to work in this name.Over the past few weeks, it seems like investors are moving away from software names with higher valuations. Granted, valuations were getting slightly out of control, it seems like faster-growth software companies will continue to receive a premium valuation. While this premium may not be as big as it was a few months ago, Atlassian has a strong operational base that will continue to grow revenues 30%+ even at scale, thus earning them a well-deserved premium.Revenue grew an impressive 36% to $363 million during the quarter, which kept pace with the 36% growth during last quarter. In addition, Q1 revenue was ahead of consensus expectations for ~$352 million and management's previous guidance of $349-353 million. The company also noted some pricing increases in September, which could have had a small impact on the revenue during the quarter, however, I believe this impact could be more profound in the upcoming quarter.Source: Company PresentationSubscription revenue continues to be the driving force, growing ~50% during the quarter to $201.1 million in revenue. This represents ~55% of total revenue and typically comes with higher operating margins. This type of revenue is highly recurring and predictable, which helps investors give more credit and a higher valuation to this revenue stream.The company also continues to expand internationally, with Americas now representing ~50% of total revenue (grew 35% during the quarter). The remaining two geographies, EMEA and Asia Pacific, each grew 37% during the quarter, slightly faster than the overall company growth. EMEA now represents ~40% of total revenue with Asia Pacific comprising the remaining ~10%. As the company continues to increase its international penetration, we could continue to see exceptional strength in the international segments.Billings were also strong during the quarter coming in at ~37% growth compared to the year-ago period, which was slightly better than the 34% growth seen during the last quarter. Billings were also ahead of consensus expectations and slightly above revenue.Source: Company PresentationOperating margins during the quarter were also better than expected, coming in at 23.4%. This was ahead of consensus expectations for ~21%. As the company continues to generate more subscription revenue, which comes on at a higher margin revenue stream, I believe the company could continue to see their margins expand over time. For now, the company will likely invest a lot into their revenue growth and further penetrating international markets, but to have a 20%+ operating margin along with 35%+ revenue growth is very impressive.The big revenue beat combined with stronger than expected margins led to a quarterly EPS of $0.28, which was ahead of consensus expectations for $0.24.Source: Company PresentationDuring Q2, management expects revenue of $386-390 million with operating margins ~22%. I believe the 22% operating margin guidance is a positive signal considering full-year guidance remains ~20%.For the full year, management is now expecting revenue of $1,560-1,574 million (up from $1,540-1,556 million). While Q1 revenue beat by ~$10 compared to management's original guidance, the ~$20 million raise in guidance signals management's confidence in the underlying business and potential for another beat and raise quarter during the year.Operating margins are also expected to remain ~20% for the full year, despite ~23.4% during Q1 and Q2 guidance of ~22%. This either means one of two things. First, operating margin during Q3/Q4 will be below the full-year operating margin guidance, or second, management continues to remain a little conservative around their margin trajectory. I believe the latter is the more likely scenario.While Atlassian continues to put up very strong quarterly financials in addition to several beat-and-raise quarters, valuation remains the tricky part. The stock is down over 15% the past month and over 5% since reporting a beat-and-raise quarter. Investors seem to find it tougher to defend these high valuations for software names despite strong performances. I believe the revenue multiples on some software stocks got a bit out of control (see what happened to Zscaler), but as long as these companies continue to perform exceptionally well, they will be great long-term investments.Source: YChartsThe company has a current market cap of $26.2 billion, and with ~$1.8 billion of cash/investments and ~$0.9 billion of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$25.3 billion. Management recently raised their full-year revenue guidance to $1,560-1,574 million, which could remain a little conservative. Using the midpoint of management's guidance, Atlassian current trades at ~16x forward revenue.Even though the company is consistently growing revenue at 35%+ with operating margins of 20%+, this valuation still seems a little high. While this is likely to be a good long-term investment, all it takes is one softer than expected quarter to see the company's forward revenue multiple drop from ~16x to under 15x, taking a large chunk out of the company's stock price.However, if we were to assume the company's revenue growth remains healthy at ~30% for FY21, we could see FY21 revenue of ~$2.05 billion, which would equate to a FY21 revenue multiple of ~12x. While this valuation is a little bit easier to digest, we have to assume another 7 quarters of 30%+ revenue growth in addition to no deteriorating fundamentals. Not so easy to digest now.The long-term viability of Atlassian remains very positive, and for investors who already have a position in the name, they would be hesitant to get out of their holding. Valuation remains a little high to put new money to work even when looking at a realistic FY21 revenue potential. With the stock under $120, I would still wait until the share price reaches closer to $100 before starting a new position or adding to a current one.Valuation is likely to remain at a premium for many years to come, so investors should not wait for valuation to come down to the ~10x forward revenue range. The better approach would be to pick up some shares on the dip and wait for a little better entry price to establish a larger position."
4297672,99986,2019-10-21T15:28:24-04:00,"Atlassian's revenue growth rates have remained stable in the high 30% range but are set to decelerate based on estimates.The stock has closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time in three years.While a bounce is possible, I would expect 15% rallies or larger to be profit-taking opportunities.","Atlassian (TEAM) has been one of the four large-cap leaders among the Software Sector (IGV) with an incredible performance in the past three years. Atlassian's stock has gained 330% since the 2016 election, outperforming the other three leaders ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM), and Adobe (ADBE) by a hefty amount. While this outperformance has been justified given its 170% growth in earnings per share [EPS] in the same period, the stock has been expensive since its Q2 highs at $150.00 per share. The consensus is now that the stock is a buy after this sharp 20% correction, but I believe the stock has corrected for a good reason. Not only is Atlassian's valuation a little frothy, but the company's revenue growth rates are likely to decelerate. This is a deadly combination for growth stocks, and the company has its work cut out for it going forward. A bounce is possible after a sharp drop from the highs, but I believe 15% rallies or larger will present selling opportunities for investors.Source: TC2000.comAtlassian has been the software behemoth over the past few years, outperforming its industry group by a ratio of 3 to 1 since the 2016 Presidential Election. While the Software Sector has gained 86% in the period, Atlassian has put up an incredible 330% return. Even more impressive is that this figure is as of Friday's close after a 20% correction from the highs. If going by the stock's July highs, the stock was up 450% in the nearly three-year period. The company's annual revenue has grown from $457 million in FY-2016 to $1.21 billion in FY-2019. The company has managed to sustain a 35-45% quarterly revenue growth rate during the period, and revenue growth came in at 36% for the most recent quarter. These figures are incredible for a company of Atlassian's size and are well above the growth rates of the other software leaders in its cohort group discussed above. However, all great things eventually come to an end, and revenue growth rates are looking like they might slip going forward for the company. Let's take a look at growth metrics below:Source: YCharts.comLooking at a chart of Atlassian's annual earnings per share, the company has an incredible earnings trend that continues to go from lower left to upper right. The company has managed to grow annual EPS by over 1,500% from FY-2013 to FY-2019, and FY-2020 earnings estimates are currently sitting at $1.01. If the company hits these estimates, this will translate to 18% growth in annual EPS year-over-year. These are exceptional numbers for a company of Atlassian's size, and this meets my criteria for growth stocks of 12% growth in annual earnings per share or better. This earnings trend is most impressive as the company has managed to put up new highs in annual EPS every single year since FY-2013. While quite premature in nature, FY-2021 estimates are sitting at $1.32 currently, forecasting 20% plus earnings growth from the FY-2020 estimates. These growth metrics are what an investor wants to see out of a company, and there are absolutely no red flags here. From strictly an earnings standpoint, Atlassian makes for an excellent candidate to buy the dips, and tuck away.Source: YCharts.com, Author's ChartHowever, if we dig into the company's revenue growth rates, we do see a minor red flag. Atlassian's quarterly revenue has seen an average growth of 35-45% over the past three years, with the most recent fiscal Q1 2020 results coming in at 35.9% year-over-year. The minor issue is that the Q2 2020 revenue estimates are currently sitting at $382.1 million, and this will represent only 28% growth year-over-year from last year's $299.0 million in Q2 2019. While deceleration is inevitable, this would represent an 800 basis point deceleration from the 36% in the most recent quarter. It is worth noting that revenue growth rates have already been decelerating for the past year, from mid 40% levels to high 30% levels. However, none of this deceleration has been material as it's been in the magnitude of 100 to 200 basis points. This deceleration going forward of 800 basis points is material, and therefore, the company is going to need a strong beat on its Q2 2020 results.The blue line in the below chart represents the quarterly growth rate, while the white line represents the two-quarter average. I like to use a two-quarter average for revenue growth rates as it helps to smooth out any lumpy quarters and better dictates the overall trend. As we can see, this deceleration is not only hitting the quarterly numbers, but it's also expected to affect the two-quarter average. The two-quarter average revenue growth rate will slip from 36% in the most recent results to 32% for Q2 2020. For this reason, investors are going to want to see Atlassian report a minimum of $394.7 million in their Q2 2020 results to dodge a quarter of material deceleration.Given that the estimates currently sit at $382.1 million, this won't be an easy feat to accomplish. This would require a top-line beat of nearly $13 million. A miss on the $382.1 million estimates would put the potential for a test of the support level near $92.00 on the table.Source: YCharts.com, Author's ChartTo summarize, Atlassian is firing on all cylinders from an earnings growth standpoint, but revenue growth rates are beginning to slip. The company has managed to trounce earnings estimates for the past several years, but this is a less easy feat to accomplish when working with decelerating top-line growth. Based on this, the stock certainly has more risks here than it did on prior pullbacks. Decelerating revenue growth rates coupled with an expensive valuation can be a headwind for a stock medium term. Unfortunately, Atlassian's incredible growth has forced it to go up against difficult year-over-year comps over the next couple of quarters. For this reason, I don't believe that investors should be in a rush to buy the dip.Source: TC2000.comTaking a look at the technicals above, we can see a minor change of character on the weekly chart. As can be seen above, the 40-week moving average has provided almost immediate support on previous tests, but this test has seen much more lethargic price action. While previous drops to this red line saw a bounce develop almost immediately, this test has seen Atlassian lose its 40-week moving average, and we've seen a more lukewarm response from buyers. The first break of a 40-week moving average after a multi-year uptrend is not a sell signal, but it is a red flag.Source: TC2000.comZooming out on the weekly chart, we can see that drop has left the stock right on its long-term uptrend line, and this is a must defend level for the bulls. Past tests of this uptrend line have been great buying opportunities, but this trend line test has shown up with larger volume than past ones. This often suggests we are seeing distribution. Distribution is defined as institutional selling to unsuspecting retail investors. The below chart shows that this multi-year uptrend began with huge accumulation and record volume, as well as supportive buying towards the lows after its IPO. This recent selling pressure is the highest dollar and share volume we've seen since this uptrend began. This high volume of nearly three times average last week is typically due to institutional selling pressure and profit-taking by bigger funds. Based on the fact that they are massive sellers at $120.00 through $125.00, I would expect them to become sellers if the stock rallies back to $130.00.Source: TC2000.comTaking a look at a daily chart, we can see that the stock is sitting right near strong support at $111.00 on a weekly close and found support right near this level last week. The issue, however, is that the stock now has strong resistance at $131.00 on a weekly close. Any rallies that cannot get back above $131.00 for two consecutive weekly closes can be considered as noise and just oversold bounces. If I were holding Atlassian and hadn't taken profits, I would be using a rally to the $128.00-135.00 area to lighten up on my position. This is because the first instance of high selling volume for a stock rarely bottoms out a stock medium-term. Instead, the stock will typically head lower as more funds clear out positions. As long as the bulls defend $111.00 on a weekly close, there's no reason to entertain a test of the $92.00 support level. However, a weekly close below $111.00 opens up the potential for a larger correction down to the $92.00 level.Source: TC2000.comSource: YCharts.comTo summarize, I do not see this drop in Atlassian as nearly as attractive, compared to the last tests of its long-term uptrend line. While previous tests were excellent buying opportunities for investors, this recent drop is more suited for trading or waiting for lower prices. I believe that a rally to the $128.00 - $135.00 level would provide investors with an opportunity to lighten up positions, or take profits if they bought the dip. Atlassian has a lofty valuation at 21.9x price to sales even after this drop, and this is much more expensive than the company's price to sales ratio of 12.1x, and 16.3x, at previous tests of this uptrend line. Atlassian is an exceptional growth stock, but buying the dip on expensive growth stocks can be a tricky proposition. Atlassian investors should be looking for $380.0 million or better on the Q2 2020 revenue numbers, or the stock will become much more susceptible to a deeper correction."
4297834,105235,2019-10-22T10:37:25-04:00,"Atlassian has reported its quarterly results from fiscal Q1 2020.The company keeps showing that, after passing the $1-billion revenue threshold and having a large customer base, is still able to deliver constant growth and profitability.It launched new premium and free plans for some of its products, and acquired Code Barrel for its Automation add-on for Jira.The quarterly performance seems strong and stable, with no signs of deceleration.

But this seems not to be a proper entry point to buy the stock, unless you are a long-term investor. Cloud software (or SaaS) stocks have been out of favor since late July, and there are no signs of change in market sentiment.(YCHARTS)Atlassian just had a nice quarter, with revenue and customer growth keeping the pace of the previous quarter, while EPS performing even stronger. It announced new premium and free editions of some offerings, and acquired a provider of add-ons for its products, with a strong presence in its marketplace.The revenue for the quarter was $363.4 million, up 36% Y/Y and 8.4% Q/Q. It came above both the company guidance of $349-353 million, and consensus of $351.79 million. EPS was up 40% Y/Y, and also beat consensus and management expectations, with GAAP and non-GAAP results of $0.28 each ($0.37 and $0.04 above consensus, respectively). Gross margin was 82.9%, 20 bps lower Y/Y, but 20bps higher Q/Q.See the image below for further details:(Q1 2020 Shareholder Letter)The number of customers increased by 7,000 (~20% annualized growth) to almost 160,000. The growth in customers keeps the same pace as in previous quarters, and there are no signs of material deceleration. Bear in mind that TEAM, with so many customers (including more than two thirds of Fortune 500 companies), keeps adding more at an impressive rate; even faster than smaller software companies with a much smaller customer base.(Q1 2020 Shareholder Letter)During the quarter, the company launched Cloud Premium editions and free plans for Jira Software, Confluence, and Jira Service Desk, as well as a free plan for Jira Core. Per the earnings release, the premium solutions ""will give teams the confidence to scale reliably with advanced features, plus higher availability, unlimited storage, and Premium Support"", while the free plans will ""provide teams of all sizes, even small ones, a set of fundamental capabilities for team collaboration"".I expect these changes to bolster customer growth, offsetting probable negative effects of the price increases announced in September for Data Center.The company also announced the acquisition of Code Barrel (TechCrunch has some details on this), a developer of add-ons for the company's products, and the creator of Automation for Jira. The latter is one of the best-selling apps in the Atlassian marketplace, with more than 7,000 companies using it. Important users include, Amazon (AMZN), Cisco (CSCO), Uber (UBER), and Atlassian itself.The target business is quite integrated with TEAM's operations, and the founders Nick Menere and Andreas Knecht are former employees of the company, with more than 10 years of experience working there, and deep knowledge of Jira -well, they were part of the team of engineers that developed it. They also have a culture and a mission in line with those of TEAM.The company raised its guidance for the next quarter and fiscal year. The revenue for the next quarter is now expected to fall in the $386-390 million range, while that of this fiscal year to be between $1.56 billion and $1.57 billion. The quarterly guidance means a growth of 29-30% Y/Y and 6-7% Q/Q. Putting this in perspective, Q2'19 was up 12% on a Q/Q basis, thus the management is being quite conservative with its expectations. And so is Wall Street.Investors that are worried about the outlook for cloud software stocks, should take note of this performance. Comparing with previous quarters, we can see that this one broke a trend of growth deceleration (details in the image below). Also, this quarter's growth Q/Q of 8.4% was the same as that of Q4'19, and just 10 bps lower than that of Q1'19. With that, FY2020 has started as good as FY2019, and there is no sign of material deceleration (as the company's outlook suggests), so there is basis for further beat-and-raise quarters.(Q1 2020 Shareholder Letter)From the earnings call, the management mentioned a couple of factors that could help TEAM maintain its level of growth (or even reach a higher one): pricing power and cross selling opportunities.As I mentioned earlier, the company announced some price increases in September, and the reaction from customers to this pricing change has been favorable so far (customer growth is proof of this). TEAM president Jay Simons highlighted that the way the company communicates those price changes to customers has been a key factor to its success in this matter.Bear in mind that the company charges lower prices than most competitors. And with customers taking price increases so well (at least for now), the company has room to grow its prices over the years, as an extra lever for revenue growth.On the other side, the company has been making acquisitions of closely-related businesses: Trello (2017) for project management and organization, StatusPage (2017), OpsGenie (2018) for incident alerting and on-call schedule management, the intangible assets of Ludable, related to Butler for Trello (2018), for workflow automation, AgileCraft (2019) for enterprise agile planning, Good Software (2019) for its analytics tools for Confluence, and now Code Barrel.None of these acquisitions are material to the size of TEAM, but as the co-CEO Scott Farquhar said on the conference call, the company is not actively cross selling those products to customers:As an example, Automation for Jira has around 7,000 users out of the ~160,000 customers of TEAM, or just 4.4% of its expanding opportunity. And that is only with one add-on. Keep in mind that TEAM has a lot of add-ons on its marketplace (revenues from marketplace were $300 million during FY2020, and the company charges marketplace sellers a 25% of their turnover) to acquire in the future, and almost $1.8 billion to spend. The opportunity there is huge, and the only bidder is TEAM. Quite an exclusive position to be in.With the recent adjustment to the share price, the market cap as of October 20 is $28.3 billion. As net debt is rather small, I will use market value instead of enterprise value for my assessment.Using a P/S ratio, TEAM is trading at 21.89 times TTM revenues and 13.8 times forward revenues (consensus).(YCHARTS)Accounting for this quarter's results, TEAM keeps trading at sky high valuations, whether TTM of forward. A comparison with peers with similar revenues suggests that it is trading at a discount to most of them, at least at first sight. Shopify (SHOP), RingCentral (RNG) and Twilio (TWLO) are growing faster than TEAM, and some have higher, while others have lower valuations. While Veeva (VEEV) has a higher multiple while it is growing slower than TEAM.Given this range of valuation, TEAM seems fairly valued. But investors should understand that cloud software stocks have been hit with concerns about slowing economic growth over the world.There are some names that have reinforced this conception. Autodesk (ADSK) lowered its fiscal year outlook in late August, then Zscaler (ZS) commented that large deals were taking longer to close, and now Workday (WDAY) fails to impress Wall Street on its analyst day, as the company expects slower growth for its Human Capital Management software.With such a negative sentiment around software stocks, I wouldn't recommend buying any of them at this point, but if you are for the long term, this fall in the cloud market could be a long-term correction, and may preclude further price appreciation.Atlassian keeps showing that, after passing the $1-billion revenue threshold and having a large customer base, is still able to deliver constant growth and profitability. It launched new premium and free plans for some of its products, and acquired Code Barrel for its Automation add-on for Jira.

Microsoft (MSFT) and ServiceNow (NOW), as well as other smaller companies, are reporting earnings. Stay tuned, maybe you'll spot a change in direction."
4293258,105400,2019-09-24T11:30:44-04:00,"Atlassian has fallen by roughly 10% since its 52-week highs.The company has grown to become a top collaboration platform among software developers.However, Atlassian is overvalued by roughly 30% based on my estimates.","Atlassian Corporation's (NASDAQ:TEAM) stock price has fallen roughly 10% from its 52-week highs, mostly due to multiple adjustments. Despite the drop in share price, I believe that Atlassian is a leader in its space with growing switching costs and network effects. At $136, however, the stock is very expensive based on my estimates, and investors can wait for a better time to build a position.(Source: Google)Atlassian had a great quarter with 36% revenue growth YOY to $335M. In fact, Atlassian managed to maintain high revenue growths of above 35% in the past four quarters. This has mostly been achieved by great products that are loved by customers across Atlassian's platforms. Even with this high growth, there is still a long runway for growth as Atlassian believes that there are potentially 1M companies that it can serve. At 152K customers, Atlassian is only roughly 15% penetrated into its total addressable market.(Source: Investor Presentation)(Source: Investor Presentation)Jira Software, Atlassian's first product, helps software developers plan and manage coding projects. Atlassian has since expanded to processes outside of software development. In 2013, Atlassian launched Jira Service Desk, a workflow solution that applies a ticketing logic, with main uses such as IT help desks, HR, and compliance. Once adopted, these software products become integrated into the IT workflow within organizations. Atlassian has also been innovating continuously to come up with better products for their customers. As seen in their shareholder letter, some of their key focuses are innovation and product development:This has led to a 98% retention rate for Atlassian in FY18. Moreover, roughly 90% of $50K+ customers purchased 3 or more products with Atlassian.(Source: Investor Presentation)Atlassian also experiences network effects. It lands inside an organization through one team and expands organically to other teams. As more teams use the products, it leads to further upselling of other products and services within Atlassian offerings. Developers also expand Atlassian's offerings through marketplace apps. In its latest investor presentation, Atlassian has over 25,000 third party developers on its platform with over $500M in cumulative sales of marketplace apps.(Source: Investor Presentation)There are other big players in software and IT like Microsoft (MSFT) and ServiceNow (NOW). There are also other legacy providers that could threaten Atlassian's market share. So far, Atlassian has been able to stay ahead of the curve in product innovation. However, we saw that Slack (NYSE:WORK) outpaced Atlassian's HipChat that led to Atlassian giving up on its product. Atlassian has to ensure that it continues to invest aggressively in product innovation to keep its customer retention rate high. Atlassian also has a unique sales model with a lack of sales representatives. Most of its customers discover Atlassian's services through its website, and that has served Atlassian well. However, as Atlassian expands into more larger and complex customers with custom needs, they need to ensure they are still able to meet the high customer service quality to ensure customer satisfaction.To value the company, I used a DCF model with the following assumptions:1) Revenue growth at 30% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect Atlassian's lead in its collaboration space as well as its ability to cross-sell its other solutions. Coupled with low penetration in its total addressable market, Atlassian should be able to execute high sales growth for at least the next five years.2) Operating margin of 35% from 2024 onwards. Enterprise software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Operating margin of 35% is considered high, but Atlassian does not have large sales teams like other enterprise software companies. As such, Atlassian has much lower marketing and sales spending as a percentage of sales. However, if companies in the future demand that Atlassian build large sales teams to better serve their needs, there could be some downward pressure on Atlassian's margins.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Atlassian will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) Atlassian has a weighted cost of capital of roughly 8% since it has achieved high positive free cash flows for several years. As such, it should have a lower cost of capital than its money-losing software peers.(Source: Author Creation using Atlassian financials)The value I derived for Atlassian is roughly $22.7B for the entire company. This represents a 30% downside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $95 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against similar software companies.(Source: Author creation using Seeking Alpha data)Compared to other software companies, Atlassian is expensive on both Price/Sales and EV/Sales multiples. Some of these software companies also have stronger growth rates like Okta, MongoDB, and Twilio. One positive note about Atlassian is that it's closer to profitability than most other software companies. However, ServiceNow generates free cash flow just like Atlassian but trades at much lower multiples with similar growth profiles.Potential investors have to decide if they believe Atlassian is worth overpaying for. Any underperformance in upcoming quarters is likely to lead to big pullbacks in stock price."

The company has an astounding Rule of 40 score of 72%, consisting of twelve-month revenue growth of 37% and a free cash flow margin of 35%. As you can imagine, the stock price is substantially overvalued, given the company's financial performance.Atlassian's success is due to an astounding 98% customer retention rate and a large number of products that leads to a fair amount of cross-selling.(Source: Atlassian)The landscape is changing, however, as Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), and even Alibaba (BABA) are moving into cloud-based team collaboration products. In response, Atlassian is shifting its business model in several ways. First, it has divested itself of Stride and HipChat, its real-time communications capability.(Source: Atlassian)This removes Atlassian from direct competition with Microsoft and Facebook which are heavy on instant messaging and video calls.Second, Atlassian is now offering freemium cloud-based tools and free trials for on-premise enterprise customers in an attempt to convert them over to the cloud. These efforts are meant to reduce friction for cloud signup and of course to compete with Facebook's free offering and Microsoft's Office 365.These marketing efforts imply that Atlassian will be taking a hit to FY 2020 revenue. And FY 2020 free cash flow will also be taking a hit of approximately $30 million due to new lease arrangements. And finally, revenue and profits had a bit of a tailwind the last year due to the falling Australian dollar. There is no guarantee the Aussie dollar will continue to fall during the next year.Given that Atlassian stock is already overvalued, and considering these financial concerns that I have identified, I suggest staying out of Atlassian for the time being. I am giving Atlassian a neutral rating.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 89 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Atlassian is significantly above the trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is higher than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Atlassian is substantially overvalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40 is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate, plus profit, adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40 calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor's perspective.Atlassian's revenue grew by 37.4% for the most recent 12 months, down from 49% in 2016.(Source: Portfolio123)Atlassian had a free cash flow margin of 34.9% for the most recent 12-month period.(Source: Portfolio123)Atlassian's revenue growth was 37.4%, while free cash flow margin was 34.9%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 37.4% + 34.9% = 72.3%The Rule of 40 calculation comes out much higher than 40%, I conclude that the company is financially healthy.Normally, when a company fulfills the Rule of 40, I don't analyze cash burn. But I am providing the SG&A expense here for reference. From looking at the SG&A expense relative to sales, I can tell that Atlassian 's cash burn is elevated but not severe.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)In the case of Atlassian, the SG&A expense is 85% of the total revenues, which is not too outrageous, considering that some high-growth stocks have an SG&A expense margin greater than 100%, meaning that SG&A expenses are higher than revenue intake.Despite the high SG&A, Atlassian claims the lowest sales and marketing spend as a percent of revenue among the big names in SaaS due to its business model.(Source: Atlassian)The low sales and marketing spend allows Atlassian to enjoy the highest R&D margin among the big names in SaaS companies.Another way to look at cash burn is to create a scatter plot that shows the operating margin/EV versus forward sales growth for SaaS stocks. The operating margin for my purposes is calculated as follows:Operating Margin = Gross Margin TTM - SG&A Expense Margin TTM(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)Atlassian is situated above the trend line, suggesting that cash burn is lower than its peers based on estimated forward revenue growth.Atlassian is making changes to its business model better positioning against new group collaboration tools from Microsoft (Microsoft Teams), Facebook (Workplace by Facebook) and Alibaba (Teambition).Microsoft Teams appears to be the most significant threat to Atlassian as the company announced that it would ""start onboarding new Office 365 subscribers to Microsoft Teams as the default for chats, meetings, and calls"". On a side note, LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft and is also one of Atlassian's biggest customers.Like Microsoft Teams, Workplace by Facebook is also heavy on communication features such as instant messaging and video calls and is offered for free or $4 for advanced users.To better position itself, Atlassian has divested itself of its real-time communications product, Stride and HipChat, selling it to competitor Slack (WORK). Instead of Slack being a competitor, now Slack is a partner. Interestingly enough, Atlassian provides Trello as an integration for Microsoft Teams and also for Workplace by Facebook.To better position itself for the cloud and the coming onslaught from Microsoft and Facebook, Atlassian is now giving away entry-level cloud products and offering free cloud trials for on-premise enterprise customers. In the Q4 2019 shareholder letter, management indicated that there were three revenue headwinds for FY 2020:In addition to the revenue headwinds, Atlassian is expecting a hit to free cash flow in FY 2020 of approximately $30 million due to investments in newly leased facilities, also detailed in the Q4 2019 shareholder letter.Atlassian experienced a tailwind this last year due to the falling Australian dollar. This is explained in the IPO letter from the founders:2018 was a bad year for the Australian dollar as shown below.This would have the effect of artificially pumping up the financial results. We don't know what the exchange rate will look like next year, but this is a risk item that could affect stock performance.Atlassian is an Australian SaaS company with head office in London England. The company offers subscriptions in the area of workplace collaboration tools and has recently surpassed $1 billion in revenues.Recently, the landscape has shifted with large players such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Alibaba getting into the cloud-based workplace collaboration business. Atlassian has responded by selling its chat and video call service to Slack, and also to more aggressively pursue its move to the cloud by offering free cloud subscriptions and free trials to enterprise customers.All of these moves will mean that revenue takes a hit in FY 2020. Free cash flow will also be lower by about $30 million due to new lease arrangements. Despite the great company fundamentals, I view the stock price to be substantially overvalued and therefore I give Atlassian a neutral rating."

It has enough cash on its balance sheet to weather a near term downturn, and demand for its products drives enough stickiness (ARR at 83%) to ensure it converts most of its leads into paying customers as SaaS platforms fight for market share. While a gloomy economic outlook doesn't leave out any stock, Atlassian plays into a lot of near term favorable themes that will continue to uphold its valuation. As a result, investors should hold or wait for a post-earnings correction to acquire some position.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Market Opportunity. Atlassian will benefit from near term trends (remote work, digital transformation, cloud migration), that will drive the adoption of its offerings. These trends will quicken the monetization of its potential market, which includes 1M+ companies, 23M+ software developers, and 800M+ knowledge workers. As of today, Atlassian has penetrated less than a quarter of its target market.Potential. Atlassian is putting its financial buoyancy to test by providing free access to more of its remote work tools. This strategy is dicey to play if your key revenue drivers compete with products like Google Suite (GOOGL) or Office 365. In Atlassian's case, its products are well diversified. This makes it a brilliant strategy for Atlassian as it benefits from a huge growth in the usage of its products, which will make it tough for customers to migrate to another platform after they've created a huge amount of work. It also benefits from the network effect to be derived from the integration of multiple offerings from its marketplace. While revenue recognition might not take a big hit, revenue collection might be delayed due to the impact of COVID-19 on small businesses and the sharing economy. Regardless, I remain bullish in the demand for Atlassian's offering due to its strong products.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Plan, Track, Support. Demand for customer support and incident management tools (accelerated by the work from home theme) will continue to drive the cloud and data center offerings. These trends will drive the adoption of Jira (key revenue driver), Opsgenie, and Statuspage. The rollout of new security and billing features will also continue to drive the value proposition of its enterprise platform.Collaborate. Collaboration tools like Trello and Confluence will witness a spike in demand driven by near term favorable trends (work from home). The near term monetization of collaboration tools will face strong competition from viral platforms like Slack (WORK), and Microsoft Teams (MSFT). Near term, cross-sell from collaboration tools will be minimal.Code, Build, Ship. Atlassian's version control and code tools are anticipated to witness a spike in usage as the load on online assets drives the reliability projects and technical customer support requests.Security, Identity. Atlassian continues to strengthen the capabilities of its security and identity offerings. This trend will help strengthen the privacy narrative of its platform while driving more product stickiness and cross-sell opportunity. The recent collaboration with McAfee is a positive development that will accelerate the adoption of its cloud offerings amongst potential customers who are worried about the security risks of a cloud deployment.Source: KoyfinFinancials. Atlassian's growth factor is compelling due to the strong performance of its products and its subscription revenue collection method. It guided for 30% revenue growth this quarter. Going forward, the mix shift towards cloud subscription offerings will be accretive to growth. Therefore, I expect a strong top-line result during the coming earnings report.SBC has boosted cash flow. This is a brilliant strategy if the network effect bet plays out. As it stands, Atlassian's product adoption success and popularity amongst developers and non-IT experts suggest that its investments will continue to pay off in the near term. Zoom (ZM) has demonstrated how big the payoff can be.I expect EPS guidance to be tough to beat. Forward EPS guidance will come in below expectations as the bearish macro outlook impacts its ability to raise pricing.Lastly, Atlassian has enough cash on its balance sheet to weather a near term recession. Though, its R&D driven growth strategy might be impacted if management decided to build a moat around its cash position to hedge the possibility of a drawn-out recession.Source: GoogleCompetitors. Atlassian's revenue growth shows that its products are no match for most competitors. Given the huge volume of work customers are expected to have created since January, additional product adoption will be a breeze. Also, while some platforms are only just giving away their products for free to widen their sales pipeline, Atlassian might recognize a better conversion rate this period as customers who are deep in the mastery of its offerings might find reasons to upgrade to paid features to fully unleash the productivity hacks inherent in its products.Macro. Atlassian derives a significant portion of its revenue from economies that might struggle to provide robust stimulus packages to assist small businesses and industries impacted by COVID-19. This might price product churn in the coming quarters.Investors. Valuation remains frothy for value diggers. Long-term growth speculators will find little fault unless the forward growth guidance is revised. Atlassian's sales pipeline is robust. It benefits from internal and external product cross integration, which drives network effect. The success of one of its products drives the success of another, while its integration with non-Atlassian products means the success of those products can be used to growth-hack some of its offerings. As a result, Atlassian's growth factor will remain strong. Management focused on a ramp in OPEX last quarter. This will impact EPS. The strong FCF margin will continue to boost its value factor. Its double-digit valuation multiple has baked in most of the anticipated near term gains. Regardless, Atlassian remains a long-term growth play.Valuation. My bullish case assumes Atlassian records minimal SMB churn as companies adopt the remote work theme. In this scenario, revenue is expected to reach $1.8B in CY'20 assuming a rapid economic rebound. Using the upper boundary of its peer P/S of 24, and shares outstanding of 251m, this gives a share price of $175.In the bear case, massive SBM churn and IT spend delay will be the dominant theme. Using the lower bound of its peer P/S range of 10x gives a share price of $62.The current SBC trend suggests more EPS dilution down the road. Also, Atlassian is oversubscribed at 26x P/S ttm. Unfavorable macro developments impacting SMBs, and weak economies might have a downside effect on Atlassian's upcoming earnings result and forward guidance. In the absence of these negative catalysts, Atlassian has a huge opportunity to keep gaining market share.Source: AuthorAtlassian has the products to fight the brewing market share war as bigger enterprises with ample cash reserves provide liquidity for existing and new customers in the form of cash financing, payment deferral, and free access to key products. The biggest benefactors of this trend will be enterprises that provide essential business continuity tools with strong stickiness and little incentive for customers to migrate to competitors or open-source tools."
4276182,104952,2019-07-20T03:11:54-04:00,"Within our universe of comparable cloud software companies in the SME/mass market segment, Atlassian typically ranks in the top 3 when it comes to valuation metrics like EV/Sales and P/FCF.We found how Atlassian's robust growth, due to its unique user acquisition strategy, reflects its premium valuation. To date, Atlassian's customers account for 60% of all Fortune 500 companies.As solid as its fundamentals and key metrics such as FCF per share and OCF per share are, its price/share has increased by more than 56% YTD.","There are two key things we look at before we invest in any technology company in the cloud software market: solid vision and robust growth. For any company having both, we are ready to pay a premium and to hold the stock forever. Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is one of such companies available in the market today. When we look at the fundamentals of Atlassian and add in all the intangible values, the premium valuation makes sense to us.First of all, we like the fact that Atlassian is a founder-led company. Vision is the most valuable part of any technology company, no matter at which stage it is at, and the founders bring the vision. As venture capitalists, we are used to looking for visionary founders and pay the right price for ownership in their companies. As of today, all founders still run their companies as key level executives to help Atlassian to stay true to its vision to be the center hub for team collaboration. The next part is about the execution. Strong execution leads to strong growth. Those companies that have made successful IPO exits typically have strong track records in executing their visions. What's intriguing is when we examine how Atlassian compares to two of its comparable companies, Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW), when it comes to revenue growth in the last three years. ServiceNow has actually grown faster than Atlassian and probably deserves a higher premium.(Source: Author. Three-year revenue growth comparison among Atlassian, Workday, and ServiceNow)However, when we look closer at the business fundamentals of Atlassian, we've learned that it is highly superior to ServiceNow and Workday in many ways. Hence, more robustness in the way it grows. In particular, we'd like to discuss how it has been able to build both sustainable user acquisition strategies to achieve such robust growth.When it comes to user acquisition strategy, Atlassian relies on its main customer segment, which are the engineers and technical team members. These engineers typically work within Quality Assurance, Operations, and IT teams of modern technology companies.(Source: Atlassian Investor Relations presentation)Atlassian's core products themselves are made for the technical demographics, which include Jira (bug tracking software), Confluence (general project management tool), and Trello (Kanban-focused project management tool). We believe that this is one of the key reasons why Atlassian has been able to scale its user acquisition process without needing any sales reps, allowing it to save its capital so it can spend on R&D and products to build its most important marketing tool; an easy-to-use product.Similar to Dropbox (DBX), Atlassian primarily converts paying users online through its website and supports them by providing highly-detailed knowledge base articles and active support forums. Atlassian allows potential buyers to try its enterprise products for free for 30 days before deciding to purchase.Atlassian's self-serve/low-friction user acquisition strategy, which involves no extensive onboarding services from dedicated salespeople, has worked really well given the fact that its main customer segments (the engineers and IT people) are power users. This allows the company to scale globally without needing much capital expansion. Due to this ability to serve customers beyond geographical borders, Atlassian scales its business through two main ways: 1) Horizontally through strengthening its core product developments and 2) vertically through API/under-the-hood integrations to complementary third-party service providers like Zendesk (ZEN), Twilio (TWLO), or HubSpot (HUBS) through its apps marketplace.(Source: Atlassian Investor Relations presentation)We have identified two key risk factors in Atlassian: 1) Strategic risk, and 2) competition risk.Firstly, we believe that having a proven low-friction user acquisition strategy could be a double-edged sword for Atlassian which carries a strategic risk. On the less favorable end, allocating much of its user acquisition resources on self-serve funnel optimization could also mean missing out on an expansion into a largely ripe overseas software markets like Japan. In more transactional markets, setting up local offices and tailored offerings can pay off in terms of higher margins and retentions in the long term. To serve as a comparison, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) strong offerings in a hybrid cloud data center and tailored CRM have paid off handsomely in the last few years.The competition for the space is also slightly getting tighter, both on the enterprise and mass-market segments. On the enterprise end, Microsoft's introduction to its team collaboration product, Teams, could easily erode Atlassian's effort to get into the enterprise market. The more interesting is LinkedIn, which is one of Atlassian's largest enterprise customers, has now become part of Microsoft. This is why the fact that Microsoft is throwing team collaboration suite into its product mix which includes Dynamics CRM, LinkedIn, and Skype for business, could be a considerable risk going forward. On the mass-market/SME segment, Facebook (FB) recently also launched an offering in team collaboration space, Workplace by Facebook, which is available for free and $3/user per month for additional features. However, we still think that it is a less superior offering than Atlassian's core product and also a less strategic introduction than Microsoft's launching of Teams.We believe that Atlassian is an interesting player in the cloud software market much due to its scalable growth strategies and diverse portfolio of products. When comparing this opportunity to other companies in our cloud software universe, we believe that the company's slightly premium position in terms of P/E and EV/sales can be explained by its ability to operate as a consumer internet company in addition to an enterprise one.(Source: Atlassian Investor Relations presentation)As of the end of 2018, Atlassian brings in on average 13.2 million monthly unique visitors to its site, which is an increase of over 35% year-on-year since 2016. This has shown that Atlassian has a proven ability to generate a consumer-like network effect as a side effect of its low-friction user acquisition strategies.(Source: Author. Comparison of relative valuation metrics for Atlassian and its comparable companies as of the end of 2018)In short, Atlassian also relies on its own customers' recommendations to bring in more customers and on the fact that its customers are already using other complementary services such as Zendesk or HubSpot that can integrate with Atlassian's product through its apps marketplace. The result is its relatively higher implied bargaining power given a fragmented customer base as indicated in its 20-F:Today, Atlassian trades at $139/share, which represents a 56% YTD growth. Almost 60% of its customer base is listed as Fortune 500 companies across 190 countries.(Source: Google Finance. Atlassian price/share chart)Compared to Q4 2017, we have seen major improvements in key metrics such as revenue per share last reported in Q4 2018, where the number is currently at 3.78 compared to 2.79 in Q4 2017. Other key metrics such as FCF per share and OCF per share have also significantly improved by 35-46% over the same time period. For the rest of the year, we feel that Atlassian can improve its other key metrics even further, leveraging the ever-growing demand side and solid global economy which allows it to expand and secure customers coming from new sectors, such as financial institutions."
4319490,69905,2020-01-28T11:43:31-05:00,FY 2020 guidance points to a declining growth rate.Atlassian's growth rates have been bolstered through expensive M&A.Avoid this overvalued stock.,"Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) has the makings of a very attractive enterprise, supported by figures that appear to be steadily rising, giving investors confidence in their investment.In reality, there are numerous reasons to be extremely cautious of this investment, as its growth is starting to decelerate, the competition is more intensive than ever, and to compound the thesis this stock is dangerously overvalued.This stock is best avoided, here's why:Below, we can see a snapshot that Atlassian wishes investors to focus on:Source: Slide 3What is particularly striking about the graph above is just how steadily Atlassian's revenues are growing.Now, allow me to offer you a slightly wider range of its progress:Source: author's calculations, *guidanceThe same information is represented in the graphs, just from a different perspective: my graph also highlights its guidance.Part of the allure of investing in Atlassian is that its remarkably steady growth rates entice investors to be willing to pay up for its stock, as they (erroneously) believe that Atlassian promises them a very steady revenue growth rate. But that's on the surface when we look deeper a very different image surfaces.Noted in BLUE in the graph below, we can see Atlassian's reported free cash flow.While, in ORANGE, we can see its free cash flow after Atlassian deploys cash to buy up peers.Source: author's calculations, figures in $ millionsFor instance, during the whole of fiscal 2019, Atlassian spent close to $420 million net of cash in acquisitions that included AgileCraft and OpsGenie.In other words, what on the first impression appears to be very steady revenue and FCF growth is indeed being supplemented through an aggressive bolt-on strategy.Realistically, for as long as the share price continues to steadily tick along and appreciate week after week, investors are not likely to become overly conscientious and ask difficult questions from their investment in Atlassian.However, as Atlassian progresses further into fiscal 2020 and starts lapping its highly acquisitive fiscal 2019, its growth rates will start to become unimpressive.At that stage, Atlassian would be left with only two options:The problem with the latter strategy is derived from the fact that the cloud-based software developing sector is incredibly hot right now, and finding a worthwhile purchase is likely to be a doomed affair.Source: author's calculationIn the table above, we are reminded of the heavyweights that Atlassian competes against. Please note, this is in no way an exclusive list. Other peers include IBM (IBM), HP (HP), PagerDuty (PD), to name a few.The reason I included the table above is to reinforce a stark reminder that not only is the competition in this space cutthroat but, more importantly, from investors' standpoint, paying up more than 24x trailing sales leaves shareholders with absolutely no margin of safety.In other words, not only does Atlassian have to deliver against sky-high expectations, but investors will in actuality need further positive surprises to drive the share price forward.Even though its growth rates are fast, looking ahead, they are not fast enough to support its valuation. Furthermore, these growth rates are being supported through expensive acquisitions.Ultimately, investors are pricing in too much hope and too little margin of safety. Avoid these shares."

But also a company valued at something like 30x next year's sales.It comes amid a stream of hot IPOs in the past 9 months or so. Cloud-based, SaaS (software as a service) companies have especially done well, even if the specifics of their businesses are hard for us as lay investors to grasp. In our discussion on CrowdStrike, I was a little more credulous about the pure quantitative numbers the company is putting on the board - triple-digit revenue growth from a not tiny base and 47% upselling to existing customers are both very impressive - while Mike was more skeptical of the company's Silicon Valley airs.Right before we published the podcast, Akram's Razor, a longtime Seeking Alpha author who has seen a thing or two in the markets and in tech especially, published an opus on the tech sector. Titled Once Upon A Time in Tech, the article went back half a century for perspective on the in-house vs. outsourcing dynamic that is at the heart of the cloud computing movement, and highlighted why we are reaching increasingly thin air.And then, a few days later, he published a short thesis on PagerDuty (PD), an on-call alert system provider with a multi-billion dollar valuation but, in the author's view, too narrow a base to expect them to win against bigger competitors like Atlassian (TEAM) or even Slack (WORK). We decided it would be worth speaking with him about his thesis and about the broader SaaS sector to understand what went into Once Upon A Time In Tech and why a short thesis like PagerDuty might work.As might not surprise anyone who read the tech article, Akram, author of The Razor's Edge on the SA Marketplace, had a lot to say about the topic. So, we're splitting this into two editions over the 4th of July weekend. This part sets the context for where we are in software more broadly, and then digs into the collaboration thesis at the heart of the PagerDuty short.

Is the 8% drop in price the beginning of a big correction or is the stock simply taking a breather from a recent run-up? We will examine Atlassian's core business and long term prospect to evaluate where it is heading.Data by YChartsThe price dip is a reflection of the high pre-earnings expectations that were baked into its share price. After all, Atlassian had been a highflier prior to earnings, up more than 70% in less than 6 months from the late October 2018 low of $68. At a $27B market cap with an EV/Revenues ratio of 25 during its pre-earnings peak, Atlassian was priced for perfection.Even though Atlassian beat the expectation by achieving revenue of $309M (beat consensus estimate by $4.62M) during the last quarter, up 38% year-over-year, and non-IFRS EPS of $0.21 (beat consensus estimate by $0.03), up from $0.09 in the year-ago quarter, while adding 5,803 new customers to reach over 144,000 total customers, it was still not enough to impress the investors, who seemed to be disappointed at the weaker than expected non-IFRS EPS guidance of $0.16 in fiscal Q4 2019, which was below a consensus analyst estimate of $0.19.Besides the slight miss on earnings guidance, there was really no other obvious negative catalyst for the $9.25 (-8.32%) price drop. However, two possible factors could contribute to this outcome. Both of these factors are short-term in nature.Firstly this appears to be a case of the market being sensitive with the high valuation, leading to investors quick to take short-term profit. Secondly, the recent stream of IPOs that have stirred up investor excitement may have driven some money managers to sell the highfliers in their portfolio in order to raise fund to participate in these IPOs. Atlassian could be one of the highfliers that fell victim of the short-term sell-off.A strong business with solid fundamentals should be able to recover from such a short-term situation and continue its growth trajectory. Let's take a look at Atlassian's business financials and long term growth prospect to see if can still justify the high valuation for the long term.Atlassian's financials paint a picture of a healthy thriving business with attractive business economics, including a high revenue growth rate, large gross margin, impressive Free Cash Flow margin, and solid balance sheet.(Source: Atlassian)As we can see below Atlassian's Statements of Operations from 2014 to 2018 with fiscal 2019 projections, Atlassian has been able to sustain an annualized revenue growth rate of 41% since 2014. The targeted fiscal 2019 revenue of $1.2B represents 38% year-over-year growth, slightly below the average but still in line with the high growth trend. Both Atlassian's 82% gross margin and 32% free cash flow margin are very healthy, considered top-of-the-class. More importantly, Atlassian has been able to sustain such healthy margins for many years, demonstrating the strength and sustainability of its business model economics. With $1.4B cash and cash equivalents and the positive free cash flow, Atlassian has ample liquidity.(Atlassian Key Financials 2014 - 2019 | Source: Author's Tabulation based on Atlassian Annual Report and Q3 FY19 Shareholder Letter)Atlassian consciously makes the strategic choice to prioritize growth and market expansion over short-term profit. As a result, it invests heavily in R&D (48% of revenue) for product development and sales automation, all aim at achieving high growth and rapid market expansion. Once it captures the maximum market share, it can dial down on the expenses and turn up profitability while churning out cash. This is a smart capital allocation strategy that should please a long-term growth investor.Atlassian's rapid revenue growth, large margins, and ample liquidity demonstrate its healthy and solid business fundamentals. Let's examine its long term prospect for sustainable growth.To sustain a multi-year high growth rate, a business must have a favorable long term prospect. Atlassian's long term prospect remains bright with strong secular tailwinds, large expanding market potential and optionality for growth. Let's take a look.(1) Secular TailwindsThere are two secular trends in the enterprise software market that are working in Atlassian's favor - the migration to the Cloud and the adoption of the Agile way of working.The first trend is the massive enterprise digital migration from the traditional on-premise infrastructure to the Cloud. Cloud software has become mainstream in recent years with many benefits and advantages over the traditional approach. Atlassian is a Cloud-first company being one of the first Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies to offer team collaboration software through the Cloud. According to the Atlassian's Q3 FY19 Shareholder Letter, there are now more than 100,000 customers subscribe to at least one Cloud product and more than 10M monthly active users on its Cloud platform. Over 90% of its new customers purchase a Cloud offering. As such trend is still at a relatively early stage, Atlassian will benefit from it for many years.The second trend is the increasing adoption of the Agile way of working by the enterprise teams. Agile has its root in software development and was born out of software developers' quest to find more productive ways to build software after the traditional top-down waterfall approach fell short of delivering satisfactory results. Atlassian has been at the forefront of this trend since its founding in 2002 and has been laser-focused in developing software to enable the Agile way of working, cementing its position as the go-to software for Agile based project management and team collaboration. In recent years, the Agile way of working has been rapidly spreading outside of the software development domain and increasingly embraced by other business teams that have suffered from similar pains with the traditional project management approach. Such widening adoption trend enables Atlassian to expand its addressable market and add more optionality to its growth strategy.(2) Large Expanding MarketRiding on the two strong secular tailwinds, Atlassian enjoys an ever-increasing addressable market. During a recent investor presentation, Atlassian president Jay Simmons indicated that Atlassian could target over 1M global companies with over $10M in revenue. Currently, with 144,000 customers, Atlassian is less than 15% penetration to its addressable market.(Atlassian Potential Customers | Source: Atlassian Investor Presentation)From the potential user type and user size perspective, Atlassian believes its core user group of software developers has the addressable size of 23M users. This can be expanded into 100M+ technical professionals including IT, program & project management, operations, technical agents, and more. And about 800M+ knowledge workers can also potentially benefit from Atlassian's general team collaboration software. With its current 13M monthly active users, Atlassian still has a long runway ahead for growth.(Atlassian Market Expansion Opportunities | Source: Atlassian Investor Presentation)(3) OptionalityAt this point, Atlassian has secured its position as the go-to team collaboration software for software development teams and has proven its value in streamlining business workflows and improving team productivity. Such workflow and productivity improvement capabilities can benefit other business teams, giving it plenty of optionalities to expand into adjacent verticals in the enterprise productivity market. For example, Atlassian will put more focus on IT Service Management and IT Operations as an area of expansion in 2019, gaining market share with its products like Jira Software, Jira Service Desk, Confluence, Statuspage, and the newly acquired Opsgenie. Beyond the obvious expansion to IT, Atlassian sees the opportunity to expand into other enterprise key functional areas by serving as the workflow engine for project collaboration, allowing teams across marketing, HR, operations, legal, design, and others to organize, discuss, and complete shared work.(Atlassian Potential New Verticals | Source: Atlassian Investor Presentation)With all these factors considered, Atlassian has a strong long term growth prospect that can sustain high-velocity multiyear growth.Now that we have established Atlassian still has a large market potential to grow into, the next question is whether it is competitive enough to win market share and defend its position.Strong competitive advantages (wide moats) are critical for a business's long term viability because the business relies on them to expand market share and to defend its own turf.As Atlassian expands its market into additional domains like IT and other business verticals, it will increasingly compete head-to-head with some of the powerful rivals like Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), ServiceNow (NOW), salesforce.com (CRM), Zendesk (ZEN) and others. Even though the market size is large enough to allow multiple winners, the fiercely competitive landscape makes strong competitive advantages all the more important.Fortunately, Atlassian has shown signs of having strong competitive advantages.Atlassian recently announced a price increase of 10-25% on some of its server and Cloud products. Yet, instead of jumping ship, many customers care about how to lock in existing pricing by entering into early renewal contracts, resulting in a surge in deferred revenue as the management discussed during the earnings call. This is a clear demonstration of Atlassian's pricing power, a sign that Atlassian has strong competitive advantages. Atlassian's high growth rate is another sign of the existence of competitive advantages as it is gaining market share.Let's dig deeper into Atlassian's competitive advantages.(1) Effective Products and Marketing StrategyFor a growth investor, it is a positive sign to see a company stays ahead of the competition by investing heavily in R&D to improve its product and customer experience. That's exactly what Atlassian has been doing. It has consistently reinvested 45-50% of its revenue into R&D to develop high-quality team collaboration products and to expand its product portfolio to serve expanding market opportunity.One key factor of Atlassian's growth strategy is to build products that sell itself, enabling it to mainly rely on word-of-mouth and self-service to grow, without the need to build a large and expensive sales force like many traditional enterprise software companies do. This gives Atlassian a huge advantage over its rivals, allowing it to operate at scale to serve millions of users from small companies to large enterprises.Atlassian also gains a competitive advantage with its land-and-expand marketing strategy. By reducing friction in the sales process with practices like online distribution, free trial offer, simple and transparent pricing, self-serve model and more Atlassian encourage teams to try and buy with minimal risk. Once it lands inside an organization through one team, it can then expand organically to other teams. There are many ways it can expand, including adding new users and teams, up-selling with more products and premium level offerings, selling marketplace 3rd party apps, and serving other additional use cases.This combination of building high quality and easy-to-distribute products with the land-and-expand strategy set Atlassian apart from many of its rivals with the traditional sales approach, allowing it to quickly establish a competitive position in the market place and win market share.(2) Strong Network EffectAtlassian naturally benefits from a network effect as it builds software to help business teams to collaborate. Whenever a user invites his/her team members to use one of Atlassian's products, the force of the network effect just becomes stronger to Atlassian's favor. With its large base of 15M community users, 500+ channel partners and integration partners, and over 25,000 of third-party apps developers on its platform, Atlassian's ecosystem has reached a large critical mass that will drive the network effect into high gear. This pairs very well with its viral word-of-mouth and land-and-expand marketing strategy.(Atlassian Ecosystem Fueling Network Effect | Source: Atlassian Investor Presentation)(3) Price LeaderEven with the recent price increase, Atlassian is still the price leader in the market, offering the best price among similar products. Being the price leader is a conscious strategic decision that Atlassian has made early on. Atlassian management applies rigorous pricing analysis to balance competitiveness and profitability. It is able to do this mainly because its viral marketing approach and online distribution model allow it to have a much lower cost structure than many of its rivals who rely on the high-cost traditional enterprise sales and distribution approach. Pricing simplicity and transparency also gives Atlassian a leg up against rivals who still carry the traditional opaque enterprise software pricing scheme.(4) High Switching Cost (Stickiness)Enterprise software is inherently sticky because it is hard to switch to another software product once a company is committed to one by investing significant amount of time, money and other resources to integrate the systems, to redesign their workflows and practices around the new systems, and to retrain their people to follow these new workflows and processes.The same can apply to Atlassian's products, which tightly integrate with its customers' team collaboration workflows and practices. Along with Atlassian's land-and-expand strategy, the more products a customer sign up, the stronger it is tied to Atlassian's ecosystem and the harder for such customer to switch. Atlassian's high retention rate reflects its product stickiness. During its recent investor presentation, Atlassian executive mentioned that Atlassian had achieved a 98% retention rate for customers who spent $50K or more, and 90% of these customers purchase 3 or more products.(Atlassian Customer Retention | Source: Atlassian Investor Presentation)All these factors strengthen Atlassian's competitive advantages, giving it wide moats to protect its turf. They only bolster the case for Atlassian to achieve sustainable long term growth at a high rate.With Atlassian's recent financial performance and long term growth prospect as discussed above, let's look at Atlassian's valuation to see if it can justify the current share price level.(1) Valuation ComparisonAtlassian's EV to Revenues ratio is considered very high at 21.45 even among the cloud-based SaaS providers that generally receive generous high multiples from the market. This puts more pressure for it to maintain a high growth rate to justify the valuation.Data by YCharts(2) Growth Projection Valuation ModelGiven's expanding market potential and its competitive advantages, I expect Atlassian to maintain a relatively high revenue growth rate for the next 5 years, gradually trending down to the low 30s% range. I believe Atlassian can achieve an 18-22% profit margin if it pares down on R&D expenses once it reaches enough scale. After all, it has already attained a 17% Non-IFRS profit margin today. With sustainable high growth rate, Atlassian should be able to justify a 45-55 P/E multiple.Putting these assumptions into a 5-year growth projection valuation model, we can reach a Base Case Year 5 Target Price of $152 (Bear Case $110 and Bull Case $205) by 2023. After discounting the year 5 target prices by 12% minimum acceptable rate of return, the present value for the Base Case Fair Price is $86 (Bear Case $62 and Bull Case $116). The Base Case Margin-of-Safety Price is $60 (Bear Case $43 and Bull Case $81) after applying an additional 30% discount on the fair prices.(Atlassian Valuation Model - Growth Projection | Source: Author's Own Model)The current price of $105 is about 20% above the base case fair price and slightly below the bull case fair price of $116. Hence, Atlassian's share price appears to have fully priced in the growth prospect. At this level, with high expectations, the share price can become more sensitive to short-term negative news, even if the underlying business remains healthy.Atlassian's post-earnings price drop is a bout of investor jitters over the weaker than expected guidance against its rich valuation. With a healthy thriving business, a favorable long term growth prospect, and strong competitive advantages, Atlassian's future still looks bright. Atlassian does face intense competition in some of the market domains it has entered. Investors should closely monitor the progress to ensure it is still gaining market share at a healthy pace.Though I still expect Atlassian to maintain a long term growth trajectory, at the current optimistic valuation, it wouldn't be surprising to see 20-30% pullbacks from time to time depending on the macro market condition and specific company and industry news. Prospective growth investors should wait for more favorable prices during such pullbacks before establishing a position. Current investors with low cost-basis and long term horizon can continue to hold the stock. Investors with shorter time frame may consider trimming their positions and lock in some gains.High growth stock can be volatile. Investors need to have the stomach for such volatility before taking a position. As such, value investors and income investors may want to stay away from Atlassian for the next several years until it reaches market maturity. By then, Atlassian should gradually transition to become a more stable profit-creating and cash-generating machine with a more reasonable P/E multiple."
4257347,20521,2019-04-26T20:06:30-04:00,"Atlassian remains focused on acquisitions that pair well with its most popular products and could help expand its reach beyond IT departments in an organization.I would like to know from Atlassian what other apps does it think are driving traction?What other developers are out there, ready to be acquired?","Enterprise collaboration software provider Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) has been steadily building up its portfolio through acquisitions. This last quarter was no different as the company continued to add other relatively smaller players to its portfolio. Its latest quarterly results also impressed the market, but the outlook failed to deliver and the stock fell 8% in the after-hours session.Atlassian's third quarter revenues grew 38% over the year to $309.3 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $305 million. Net loss came in at $202.8 million, compared with net loss of $15.8 million reported a year ago. The significant increase in losses was due to a non-cash charge of $172.6 million for marking to fair value the exchange feature of Atlassian's exchangeable senior notes and the related capped calls. On an adjusted basis, Atlassian recorded adjusted earnings of $0.21 per share compared with the Street's forecast of an EPS of $0.18.By segment, Subscription revenues grew 57% to $166.5 million and maintenance revenues grew 20% to $98.9 million. Perpetual license revenue grew 13% to $23.2 million and other revenues increased 36% to $20.8 million.The company ended the quarter with 144,038 customers on an active subscription or maintenance agreement, adding more than 5,800 net new customers during the quarter.For the current quarter, Atlassian expects revenues of $329-$331 million with an adjusted EPS of $0.16. The Street was looking for revenues of $327.6 million and an EPS of $0.19 for the quarter.Atlassian remains focused on acquisitions that pair well with its most popular products and could help expand its reach beyond IT departments in an organization. Earlier this month, it announced the acquisition of Sydney-based startup Good Software for an undisclosed amount. Good Software was founded in 2016 as a ""side hustle"" to provide Atlassian Marketplace apps for Atlassian's collaboration platform Confluence. Within a year, it had won the Atlassian Marketplace Best New Vendor Award. It now has more than 500 customers for its Atlassian Marketplace apps that provide analytics tools for Confluence users and admins.Owler estimates that Good Software was generating annual revenues of $1.5 million. The acquisition will help Atlassian deliver embed these analytics capabilities within Confluence. Good Software was bootstrapped.In March this year, Atlassian also announced the $166 million acquisition of enterprise agile planning software provider AgileCraft. AgileCraft helps organizations build and manage strategic projects and workstreams. Organizations use AgileCraft to map strategic projects, gain visibility into project status, identify risks and dependencies, and gain more accuracy around capacity planning and return on investment. Texas-based AgileCraft was founded to come up with a better way to manage large portfolios of work using lean principles. Its founding team developed an agile management platform that would integrate engineering, product management, and portfolio management. It wanted to maximize value delivery by linking strategy to execution in real time. AgileCraft had raised $10.1 million in funding. Atlassian expects the acquisition to add $1-$2 million to its fiscal 2019 revenues.Atlassian believes that the addition of AgileCraft to its existing family of agile products will increase the breadth and depth of agile teams it can support. Together, the combined entity will provide a unified solution for team-level and enterprise-level Agile, with tools that can scale to meet the diverse needs of enterprise organizations. AgileCraft complements Atlassian's tools by extending visibility at a portfolio or program level.Atlassian's platform strategy is clearly delivering strong results. It has a thriving marketplace that offers more than 1,500 Jira apps and nearly 850 Confluence apps. The third-party developed apps help organizations with services ranging from IT Service Management, Project Management, Customer Support to providing Visualization Capabilities.The recent acquisition of Good Software is an illustration of how Atlassian is leveraging its PaaS strategy to drive growth. As I wrote earlier, launching a PaaS is the best way to ensure that adjacent products built on compatible stacks grow in the SaaS player's eco-systems, without taxing their P&Ls. I would like to know from Atlassian what other apps does it think are driving traction? What other developers are out there, ready to be acquired?Atlassian's stock is trading at $103.75 with a market capitalization of $24.85 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $117.06 last month. It has grown from the 52-week low of $54.57 that it had fallen to nearly a year ago."
4255476,104608,2019-04-19T12:31:39-04:00,Atlassian reported Q3 earnings with revenue growth of 38% and operating margins expanding 200bps compared to the year-ago period.Shares dropped nearly 10% post-earnings due to billings growth of near 30% coming in below consensus and decelerating from nearly 50% last quarter.Valuation has come down a bit since reporting earnings and could be a potential opportunity to pick up some shares.,"Atlassian (TEAM), an Australia-based software vendor specializing in workflow and collaboration tools, reported strong FQ3 earnings with revenue growth of 38%, a slight deceleration from 39% in the last quarter. However, the stock was down nearly 10% after earnings due to billings growth slowing down to just over 30% compared to nearly 50% last quarter.The stock has performed exceptionally well since going public in 2015; however, valuation was approaching all-time highs heading into earnings, and any perceived weakness was bound to send the stock down a bit. Despite the softer-than-expected billings, which could have been somewhat expected due to the unnaturally high billings growth last quarter, the stock is still near the upper end of comparable valuations and should be approached cautiously.Data by YChartsAtlassian has been a great stock to own over the past year and was up nearly 70% since its October lows. After FQ3 earnings, the stock took a nearly 10% hit as investors looked to re-evaluate billings growth and potential revenue stream. With valuation remaining heightened compared to other fast-growth software names, I would continue to be cautious around building a large position.Over the long-term, with revenue still growing near 40%, I believe this name will continue to be a winner. Next quarter's earnings report will be big as management will introduce FY20 guidance metrics and investors will be able to see how fast revenue could grow over the next 12 months. I think TEAM has the potential to grow revenue 30%+ for the next two years, and if this ends up being true, its premium valuation is more than justified.Data by YChartsRevenue growth again came in well ahead of consensus estimates. Revenue for Q3 was $309 million, growing 38% yoy and was well ahead of consensus estimates for $305 million, or 36% y/y growth. Despite the overall fears with software companies reporting revenue growth either below or in line with consensus estimate, Atlassian was able to clearly beat this trend. Being one of the first software companies to report earnings earlier this year, this could set up the rest of comparable software companies for a solid earnings season. However, TEAM's stock dropped nearly 10% as billings decelerated quite a bit from last quarter.Source: Company PresentationDuring the quarter, Atlassian noted several growth drivers. For example, the company grew the numbers of customers by nearly 6,000, a growth rate of over 20% yoy.The company continues to be successful driving subscription revenue, with a growth rate of 57% for the quarter, the third consecutive acceleration in growth rate. Subscription revenue is very valuable for the company for two main reasons. First, this type of revenue is highly recurring and predictable, meaning management has a better handle on its guidance metrics and underlying business strength. Second, and maybe more important for the stock price, subscription revenue typically means a higher valuation premium since investors are typically more comfortable in the revenue stream. This is one of the biggest reasons why software companies trade at premium revenue multiples, because their revenue streams are highly recurring and predictable.The company did disappoint investors in one area, which was billings. Billings is a great indicator of what the company actually collects from its customers. Billings growth for the quarter was around 30%, which was well below last quarter's impressive near-50 billings growth. I suspect some of the deceleration was due to last quarter's very strong growth. In the past, it appears billings growth was closer to mid or high 30% range.Source: Company PresentationDespite the billings turbulence, the company continues to report very strong gross margins at 86%. The software-centric aspect of the business will continue to propel gross margins to be at or above the 85% level. In addition, operating margins saw some improvement as well. Although there is some seasonality to operating margins, the 19% margin for the quarter expanded from 17% in the year-ago period. Over time as the company's revenue growth naturally decelerates, we should expect operating margins to improve. However, it is still impressive that a company growing revenue nearly 40% is generating operating margins above 20% for the full year.Source: Company PresentationDue to another strong quarter, management raised its guidance for the full year. Revenue is now expected to be $1,205-1,207 million, which is up from $1,195-1,199 million. I believe there continues to be upside to its revenue guidance as management is likely to remain somewhat conservative given the company's fast growth rate. In addition, management expects EPS of $0.82 for the full year.Free cash flow is expected to come in around $385-395 million, which represents a margin of 32% at the midpoint. Going by the rule of 40, Atlassian is one of the highest revenue growth/FCF margin software companies I can think of. Once revenue inevitably begins to decelerate, though I believe this could be a few years away from meaningful deceleration, I believe FCF margin will continue to expand, and the company will become one of the strongest FCF generators in the market.For FQ4, the company expects revenue of $329-331 million, which seems to be slightly ahead of consensus estimates. I think there could be some slight upside to revenue in the upcoming quarter; however, investors will continue to place a heightened focus on billings growth. Management also expects EPS of $0.16.Atlassian continues to be a challenging name to value largely due to the lack of a clear peer group when it comes to valuation. Even when looking at some of the highest-quality software companies with high revenue growth rates, it is challenging to find a peer group which suggests Atlassian is undervalued.Data by YChartsThe chart above shows a handful of software tech names that have a very high revenue growth rate and potential to become market leaders in their respective industries. As you can see, Atlassian has continued to trade at the high end of this peer group over the past year. The only name trading at a higher premium valuation I could find was Zscaler (ZS), which continues to post beat-and-raise quarters despite revenue growth of 45%+.Heading in Q3 earnings, TEAM's revenue multiple was approaching 23-24x, which seemed to be a bit much for the company. As you can tell from the chart above, post-earnings, its revenue multiple is now near 19.5x, which seems more appropriate.I believe in the long-term viability of the company and think investors who already have a position built in this name should continue to hold. Despite valuation coming down a bit last week, I think there still could be some risk to the name heading into next quarter. However, if you are a strong believer of the potential revenue growth of 30%+ for the next two years with potential margin expansion along the way, I think at this price, it is a good idea to pick up some shares.Risks to Atlassian include revenue growth deceleration and valuation. If revenue growth unexpectedly decelerates, investors could be quick to take money off the table, especially considering the very high valuation it currently trades at."
4255681,103480,2019-04-22T10:22:46-04:00,"Shares of Atlassian tanked ~10% after reporting Q3 results, despite a resounding beat on both revenue and EPS.
        This is a rare move for a stock that is typically a crowd-pleaser during earnings releases. Last quarter, Atlassian popped 10% on earnings.
        The stock's double-digit forward revenue valuation is starting to weigh on stock gains.
        A pricing change last fall could also have pulled in billings from FY20, implying risk for the coming year.
        Atlassian could also be impacted by the successful IPO of Zoom. While primarily a video conferencing company, Zoom is also a popular collaboration tool.","It's a rare day when shares of Atlassian (TEAM), the Australian software vendor behind a suite of collaboration and project management tools, sinks on earnings. After reporting Q3 results and releasing Q4 guidance, Atlassian's stock dropped nearly 10% - the exact opposite reaction that investors had to Atlassian's last quarter. A glance at the headline figures wouldn't tell the whole story - as per usual, Atlassian beat Wall Street's targets handsomely on both the top and bottom lines, and its Q4 guidance was above expectations for revenue - which, in my view, offsets the slight miss on the EPS forecast. Let's quickly dive deeper into Atlassian's most recent results. See the company's earnings summary below:Figure 1. Atlassian 3Q19 resultsSource: Atlassian Q3 earnings releaseRevenues grew 38% y/y to $309.3 million, smashing Wall Street's estimates of $304.6 million (+36% y/y) by a two-point margin, and showing only one point of sequential deceleration relative to last quarter's growth rate of 39% y/y. Operating margins fell slightly to -9% versus -5% in the year-ago quarter, but nevertheless Atlassian's pro forma EPS of $0.21 still beat Wall Street's expectations of $0.18.At this juncture, investors are asking two questions: first, if Atlassian's results were this good, what's behind the precipitous fall in Atlassian shares; and second, is this a buying opportunity? Let's cut to the chase: despite the sharp drop in a perennially expensive stock, investors should still stay on the sidelines here. In my view, there are two drivers behind Atlassian's fall from grace, neither of which will cease being headwinds in the short term. The first is valuation, a risk I had pinpointed on this stock since last quarter. Alongside names like Workday (WDAY), ServiceNow (NOW), and Adobe (ADBE), Atlassian belongs to a rarefied breed of SaaS stock that has always maintained a huge valuation and nearly never fails to impress investors with every quarterly release. That big valuation seems to be catching up with the stock now.At Atlassian's post-earnings share price of ~$102, the stock is trading at a market cap of $24.42 billion. After netting out $1.77 billion of cash on its balance sheet and $845 million of long-term debt, the company has an enterprise value of $23.50 billion. In the next fiscal year (FY20), which begins in July, Wall Street is expecting Atlassian to post revenues of $1.53 billion (per Yahoo Finance),representing 27% y/y growth over FY19's midpoint revenue guidance of $1.206 billion. This indicates that Atlassian is trading at a mammoth valuation of 15.4x EV/FY20 revenues. Very few software companies - even the most expensive investor darlings - are able to maintain such elevated multiples forever. Even after a ~10% haircut in share price, Atlassian still seems like it has a longer way to fall. See where other comps are currently trading (note that these comps' forward growth rates are similar in the mid-to-high 20s):In my view, a ~12x forward revenue multiple appears more appropriate for Atlassian, given where peers are currently trading. This implies a price target of $81, or 21% downside from current levels. Until Atlassian reaches those levels, I'd be more inclined to stay on the sidelines.The second catalyst behind Atlassian's fall is purely fundamental. Wall Street analysts asked a lot of questions on the Q3 earnings call around Atlassian's recent price increases, which went into effect last fall. Atlassian had, at the time, positioned the price increases as recompense for the various upgrades that the company invested into its product suite. Analysts hypothesized that customers reacted by booking Atlassian products before the price increase, which had a favorable impact on billings in Q2 (indeed, a third-party Atlassian consultant Isos Technology issued a blog post in September of last year encouraging clients to ""order up""). Here's how James Beer, Atlassian's CFO, responded to this line of questioning on the Q3 earnings call:The bottom line here is that Q4 and FY20 billings may be adversely impacted by the pull-ins that that Atlassian encouraged due to the price increase. Q2's strength, in effect, may have robbed billings from future quarters. This may drive risk against Wall Street's targets over the next several quarters, and the share price decline is a cautious reflection of a few softer quarters ahead.The same day that Atlassian reported earnings, video conferencing company Zoom (ZM) went public on the NASDAQ, raising north of $350 million and soaring 72% on its first day of trading. After a bruising first few weeks of trading for Lyft (LYFT), Zoom's incredible IPO success was a breath of relief for IPO and growth investors. Zoom's success may have hit Atlassian especially hard. Though Zoom is primarily known for its videoconferencing tools, the embedded collaboration tools makes it a credible competitor to Atlassian. Admittedly, Atlassian's forays into video conferencing are rather limited. The company used to offer a tool called HipChat, which had video capabilities (dubbed HipChat Video). HipChat's functionalities have since been discontinued and rolled into a combined Atlassian + Slack solution, but it's fair to say that Atlassian's product roadmap could one day re-incorporate video collaboration. The popularity of Zoom, then, might represent a threat to Atlassian's future addressable market. Strength in Zoom's IPO may have spilled over into additional weakness in Atlassian stock.In my view, Atlassian continues to look incredibly risky at extremely high valuations. Though Atlassian managed to beat Q3 expectations, the fear that billings might slow down in FY20 due to competition, pulled-in demand from last fall's pricing increase, and natural deceleration are weighing heavily on the stock.

Part 2 will be out next Tuesday. We hope you enjoy this transcript.Daniel Shvartsman: On this week's Behind the Idea, I speak to longtime Seeking Alpha author and tech investor, Akram's Razor about the Software-as-a-Service sector and his short thesis on PagerDuty. We start with background on where we are as a sector and why history appears to be rhyming.DS: And we look at the tough spot PagerDuty finds itself in, where a bigger company it relies on, Atlassian (TEAM), maybe turning its sights on the company.DS: We covered CrowdStrike (CRWD) last week, and while the company seems impressive from many operational perspectives, its upside seemed fairly limited when you factor in valuation. We're in a hot IPO period where companies are coming to the market, mature and fully priced. What does that mean for investors? We go long on the topic and we’ll have a two part series with Akram's Razor about the sector, building on his popular ""Once Upon A Time In Tech article from Seeking Alpha.Listen to or subscribe to Behind the Idea on these podcast platforms:DS: Welcome to Behind the Idea. I'm Daniel Shvartsman. We’re following up on last week's conversation about CrowdStrike. Mike Taylor and I reviewed the high flying Cyber Security IPO to see if there's anything there and we came away with mixed thoughts. Shortly before we posted the podcast, longtime Seeking Alpha author, Akram's Razor published a fascinating history and assessment of the SaaS space and tech in general, titled ""Once Upon a Time in Tech.""While it didn't mention CrowdStrike specifically, as far as I remember, it gave context for how the Software-as-a-Service sector has been changing and evolving over the years. It's sort of assessed whether we're in a bubble environment now, among other things. Shortly thereafter, he came out with a short idea on another high flying tech IPO from 2019, PagerDuty, a business that involves pinging operations teams to let them know about events on their tech servers.He said that this marks a period where SaaS companies are starting to battle each other directly, which means a new chapter in the SaaS history. So I'm going to ask him about that, about where we are in tech, about the PagerDuty idea specifically, maybe we'll get to CrowdStrike as well a little bit. And we'll discuss what opportunities are out there for nimble investors.Before we begin, Behind the Idea is the podcast that looks at what makes great investment analysis work, based on ideas from the Seeking Alpha ecosystem. I don't have any positions in any stocks that I expect us to discuss today. If I end up having a position I'll disclose it at the end of the podcast. I'll also ask Akram to disclose at the end of the podcast based on what we cover. Nothing on this podcast should be taken as investment advice of any sort.Okay, Akram, welcome on Behind the Idea.AR: Thanks, Daniel. How's it going?DS: It's good. It's good to have you on here finally. You're one of the first authors that we covered back more than a year ago. So it's fun to have you on the podcast.So you published ""Once Upon a Time in Tech."" I want to start there because it's really -- it's just an -- it's an enjoyable and impressive read. It goes back to the 60s I think is where it stretches to as far as analyzing how different trends, bubbles ideas kind of pop up in the tech ecosystem. And then what that means for where we are now. And I don't -- it's a long piece. And so I'm not going to ask you to sort of hit everything there. But I'm just curious how did that looking backwards help inform you as far as thinking about where we are right now in the tech space, in SaaS and so forth?AR: Well, I mean, I guess you're looking for, where you are in the cycle. And I think there's been a tremendous run recently in software obviously since, probably, let's say, mid-2017 through late 2018. And then we had, whatever you want to call it, the market crash at the end of last year. And then a really momentum-driven surge, and a lot of the software names followed by just a wave of IPOs.So in looking at the history, I mean, I guess the origination of the ""Once Upon A Time In Tech"" piece would be -- there's a book, trying to -- the name escapes me right now. But it looks into the history of like, different market cycles. It's written by this pen name author, under the economist, Adam Smith. (Editors' note: the book is The Money Game, by Adam Smith). But I mean, I'd read this book ages ago and I mean, I had gotten into the sections of it where I looked into like fracking mania in the 60s and one of them was also Computer Leasing. And like the go-go market, I guess is what it was called in the late 60s.Seeing, I'd never really dived deeply into the underlying drivers in that market, and going back and taking a closer look at the individual names, the way people were investing, and then just seeing the similarities to today, I think was very helpful in the sense that this is like outsourcing/in-sourcing virtuous cycle that goes on in all business, which is what SaaS is, about these days, and how it's proliferated and the likes of AWS and so on and so forth.So I'd say it was -- it was helpful in the sense that you started connecting dots. I mean, I don't know how thoroughly you went through what I wrote, but to me a lot of the fascinating stuff was around IBM (IBM). IBM is a computing mainframe powerhouse, and that not being essentially affordable for everybody else, and the computer leasing businesses that were built around it in the late 60s. And, looking at today at where Amazon (AMZN) is, where the public clouds are, and thinking about their infrastructure, really, as, you know, supercomputers in the same way that an IBM mainframe may have been back in the late 60s. I guess that would be a starting point.As far as the valuations, bubbles are -- there's always a psychology element, right? So I hate looking at valuation as a pure proxy, even on stuff recently published, some of these investors these days. I mean, I think you have a whole new generation trading the market which probably hasn't gone through even a crash yet, probably since I mean, what -- since the financial crisis. I mean, there's just -- there's some people who just don't even have that perspective and it almost makes you feel old, when you look at the -- at people who looked at the 2000 bubble and whatever you want to call it, 2007, 2006, 2008 was more financialization, but when you start seeing investor behavior kind of mimic that, it's always good to look at the history.DS: So what I want to -- jump in and you start the article with this price chart or this performance chart for SaaS, and how it's outperformed the rest of the market. And then yeah, and you talk about the computer leasing cycle, you talk about -- there's a lot of interesting stuff there in terms of, for example, the advantages that Netflix (NFLX) had in its early days or what fueled Amazon, what AWS being such a beneficiary of the financial crisis and so forth.But what I'm curious about for our time frame right now is, betting against SaaS, if you don't do it in a smart way has been a really dangerous thing over the last few years. That chart sort of spells that out pretty immediately. And what you get -- we'll get to the specific PagerDuty thesis in a minute, but what you're getting at is that something is changing now, and I -- also in the ""Once Upon A Time In Tech"" is that there is something different, yeah?AR: Right. I see where you're going with it. And that is true. I mean, look, if you had invested in a good basket of -- and a friend of mine, we discussed this maybe a month, a month and a half ago, and if you looked back empirically, and you'd bought a basket of you know, all the IPOs in the late 90s, right? And you've held them to today, there's this perception, I guess from an investor that you would have done poorly, because you've got Pets.com and the b2b names and all these companies that disappeared, they went to zero and so on and so forth. And the reality isn't the case. You actually would have done amazing because you got a lot of these companies like an Amazon, Salesforce (CRM), a NetSuite, which IPOed with a few million in revenue, right? And they -- the winners there more than offset the losers, right?So for all the names that went to zero, if you bought an equal weighted basket, the 300, 400 500, 1,000x returns pan out very favorably for you. That's not where we're at today, because you now have very mature names, right. So and the way that private markets function have changed the game in the sense that things go public, much more established. So one, I think key debate point, and particularly when you do a short thesis, you'll get people commenting and saying, like all of us, this is not that crazy. This is a real business. We're not talking about Pets.com comparisons from 1999.And the reality is that, well, your downside may not be zero. But when these businesses go public, like let's say a CrowdStrike at $15 billion or PagerDuty trading at $5 billion to 80% downside still turns these companies into multibillion dollar successful companies, right?DS: Yeah, right. It's a different -- in the past, you have the risk of them being vaporware, sort of these quasi-real companies, but in this case, it's not a question of that. It's a question of the fact that a lot of the valuation is already, or a lot of the growth has already played out.AR: The VC ecosystem has gotten to the point where, it's more than -- it's more than angel investing and seeding. I mean, you're incubating them at a level that when by the time you bring them to the public markets, look at them -- just look at the look at the history of IPOs over the last, let's say, recent cycle. I mean, there's your occasional really nice success story in software and a Facebook (FB) and, which goes public at $100 plus billion and is $400 billion today, but -- or $500 billion roughly wherever it is trading right now. But Twitter's (TWTR) still trading below where it traded on its first day, right? You've got your Fitbits (FIT) and your GoPros (GPRO), and I mean, there was the whole social mania cycle. Like I mean, I think I remember Renren (RENN) traded at like $10 billion valuation on its first day and it came out as the Facebook of China. And I mean, those guys are not even doing anything related to that these days.So you can see in terms of what comes public, your upside is more cap than it used to be. Because they -- once they're listed in the public markets, if it's been a good and successful story, you're starting out with, like, let's say a Slack (WORK), right? What's failure for a Slack at this point? I mean, anything less than turning into a $50 billion to $75 billion company over the next five to ten years.DS: Right there and it's -- something like Slack is also -- they have a lot of mindshare already. It's not like they are going to…AR: They have mindshare, there was there was instant messenger. There was Microsoft Teams (MSFT) is going to do whatever it has been doing in the space. You've had Gchat, you've had -- like, there's always, if you talk to the engineers, by the way, I mean, like there has been a flavor of element in certain tools, right? And it's like, what ends up being sticky? I mean, is Slack going to be the MySpace of its space? Or is it going to be your next Facebook as far as -- as collaboration? I mean, we -- what was it that Microsoft bought? I don't even remember, there was Yammer, back when…DS: Yammer, yeah, that's right.AR: …social was getting big in chat and whatnot. We went through the whole workspace social type dynamic. And a lot of that flamed out. And you ended up with Slack today. And I do think a lot of it is a function of these on-demand services. And getting to this point where, let's say, we look at streaming and Netflix and everybody's streaming now, right? When you look at subscription services, everyone's doing subscription services. I was like -- I think a key point I focused on in there, you've got financial companies, like who was in there who Fidelity or no, Charles Schwab (SCHW), right, where they're going the subscription model. You got Burger King (QSR) exploring the subscription model.It's that convergence. It's not like where you're adding dotcom at the end of your brick and mortar business model to just try to get like a boost in your valuation. But this the concept of everything becoming subscription has permeated as if there is this superiority to subscription. I mean, we get it in software, right? I mean, it makes sense. You're not releasing Windows 95. And then two years later another release in the two years that there's a continuous update cycle. You're maintaining that software, it's all online, it's all on demand.But other businesses exploring it -- it's, you're not like the differentiation element of what it used to be, isn't there. And then you get these company who are going public and it's like, okay, well, CrowdStrike, for example is okay, well, we're at -- we are AWS native. I mean, okay, great. How many other companies are in security?DS: How much does that -- does the cloud element matter here? I mean, I'm -- I would have to sort of dive back into your -- the Once Upon a Time in Tech to pull it all together again, but the cloud element, the fact that and it makes -- when we're talking about Slack, for example, which we're used to just working wherever we are. And as we speak, Slack is having a bad day, and it is irritating when that happens. So they're big enough that, that matters.But when you have sort of that cloud, because it applies -- CrowdStrike in theory, they're special because they are -- they have that crowd sourced element they are reporting, but also the fact that they can -- it's not you can't fire a wall like they're not firewall and because you're in the cloud because you're operating with servers around the world. So they have -- like, does that, is that just a different set of clothes on the same old story? Or is there anything different about it? And the same I guess for PagerDuty.AR: There's an argument there that their approach to endpoint, because they're in the cloud is going to be more robust, right? If you're -- if you are on demand, and it's more real time, and like your history of your access points to I guess, threats is -- it's a wider net, you're going to be in a better position.DS: Okay.AR: I mean, I don't necessarily know like, look, I said, an easier way to do this is to just like rewind, go back to FireEye (FEYE) in 2013-2014, right. And they wrote on the back of the hype of the Sony hack, and we've got NSA analysts. There was there was a company in adtech, Rocket Fuel where NASA engineers, right, I think I pulled one from the 1960s where it was like some startup for it was like a Ticketmaster built by an ex-NASA guy, right? And you look at CrowdStrike I mean, a lot of the people are coming out of Symantec and McAfee and the standard endpoint place. But at the same time, you get that where ex-Obama administration, FBI, this, this, that, were actually doing attribution analysis to where the threat came from.And then there's always debates around it. I don't necessarily know that the cloud element -- I mean, Symantec (SYMC) and, let's call them the 1.0 guys, have moved in that direction. This is where you get into this whole a company that was IPOing 10 years ago, in cloud, it's business case would be we're ripping and replacing a legacy on-premises vendor, right? We're way past that we're in the cycle, in anything where the 1.0 haven't converged and adapted to being 2.0s.I mean, look at some of the most successful companies in cloud are, you know, Adobe (ADBE) for example, right? Microsoft has done amazing, for example. I thought my office was going to be in such trouble around their dependency on Windows and their pivot to office, right into the cloud, just basically made it virtually impossible for anybody to compete, just seamlessly transition. And I think they're doing probably better today without question than they were before, just because of that transition.So it's -- I think companies have evolved on that level. I mean, there are some where they're still embedded and you and you look at an Oracle (ORCL) and the skepticism that came out of Ellison early on and now how much they talk about their CloudStack and their cloud, their SaaS-based growth and so forth. But I mean, going back to your initial question is like the differentiation I think has dwindled. That's number one. So you have to be you have to start looking through and sifting through the hype. And then you do get these dynamics where, like a Slack for example, where -- I mean I think Slack, PagerDuty Atlassian, et cetera, are all very interesting because they're kind of overlapping in everything that they want to do. Right. So these guys are almost native competitors against each other. I mean, Atlassian was competing directly against Slack and they chose to exit that market and partnering with Slack and strategically invested in them last summer, right?So I think you're seeing things where some of these vendors are recognizing things are a little bit too crowded here and here and we need to focus on, our niches. And once you start looking at things from that respect, yeah, I don't, I think people who criticize software stocks and focus on the lack of earnings are do miss a little bit of the point in the sense that, okay, the model makes sense from a subscription basis. You're acquiring a customer, like you have the cash flows. And you can fund the customer acquisition.But when they go from 7 to 10, to 20, to 30 to 40 times sales and 50 times sales, right, then you start looking at them you say, yeah, okay, but what's your profitability is going to look like, if we're going to slice up this pie. And the barriers to entry for so many people, building software have gotten so low, that I can build a nice $30 million, $40 million $50 million business. And I think that's something I touched on the Founder, what's his name? Jason Fried, Basecamp. He's criticized VCs.There's a hot company right now. I think Business Insider did a piece on them, a couple other people did a piece on them. It's called Notion. I don't know if you've heard of Notion.DS: Notion is new to me, no. Basecamp we -- Basecamp I've used a little bit, but Notion's new.AR: Okay. So Notion is like, it -- it's attacking like Evernote, Slack, a bunch of these things all in one, right? So it's a collaboration tool. And the Founder does not want to take any VC money. And he's literally -- there's been articles written about him lately about how every single VC is calling and he is rejecting them every single day, right? But then you look at this company like -- well, Slack's at $20 billion, or $25 billion, you look at what Atlassian is doing. If Notion is going to be successful, it's taking out a little bit of Atlassian's can band blood with Trello. It's taking out Evernote’s little market on the note side. It's taking out some of what Slack is doing.So like if everyone is in collaboration with when you look at the market where Zoom and Slack, for example, trade today like, well, there's like how big is the pie to be split with what every single one of you wants to do. And then, 50 other startups that are like, okay, I can kind of lump this together like why do I need separate standalone applications? That's essentially part of where you get into the PagerDuty thesis, right?You look at a PagerDuty workflow, and you look at this DevOps dynamic, which is a secular theme, right? We have all these on-demand services. Everybody's got a website, right? Everybody's got -- needs 99.9% uptime. It doesn't make sense that well, okay, on-call is going to be more important. It's no longer is a doctor and going to the emergency room, everybody running an on-demand cloud era business, is going to have to have some people who are responsible for making sure things are up at all the time, which I mean has always been the case with the key infrastructure guys and the public cloud guys.But when you take it to the smallest business or two, what maybe many people would view us old economy businesses yeah. And you're just typical Fortune 500 business whether it's banking, or whether it's media like a Disney (DIS) or whatnot you need these DevOps engineers. But when you look at the products that are that are being used the tools being used by them I mean it's a mishmash of several things overlapping. You get you get these monitoring systems like a New Relic (NEWR) or a Navios or a Spunk (SPLK) that generate an alert. That alert goes to PagerDuty, you integrate it across the monitoring devices and then into the collaboration tools, because as soon as that alert gets to the engineer, he's hopping on a Slack channel, right?And remember, all these alerts go can go right into a Slack channel. What you're talking about here is also redundancy. That creates some noise, but like, you just get your alert in your Slack app. And that's when you look at it. You're like, All right, I'm paying $7 a month to have the ability to Collaborate on slack and I could put the alert in there Am I going to pay $40 $50 $90 a month for you to route that to me and SMS me and then do my call escalation.So Daniel gets an SMS and Daniel has an answer, call Akram, et cetera. And that's when you start looking at it and you're like, okay, I mean, and once the incident occurs, I'm going to be ticketing you a JIRA Service Desk, I'm going to be using Atlassian's status page to update the customer facing website and whether anything is down and whatnot. And if all these companies are going to grow and they're trading at 20 and 30. All these companies are going to grow and they're trading at 20 and 30 ex sales, they're going to be butting heads, right?DS: Right.AR: Like, where is Slack naturally going to expand in a way, if it wants to go in any direction.DS: So to reset on this PagerDuty thesis, we're talking about a bunch of companies that develop a collaboration oriented tools. Pager Duty's specifically focused on warning you something is wrong, it connects between more of the New Relics, which I understand is more of the server side software. And it connects to the actual people who can do stuff about it. And Slack is…AR: Yeah, and you are like Navios, Splunk, Datadog, Diamond Pace, there's a ton of stuff I'm monitoring, right? Once you build your -- once you're building your infrastructure, and let's say this Uber (UBER) distributed, micro-services manner, right? You're going to monitoring is a much bigger deal. Right? Because you have so many more, you -- once you've distributed everything, you have so many more points of failure. But yeah, go ahead.DS: So we've sort of already established that it's not enough to now all of a sudden say, oh, now we're in the cloud. Everybody's in the cloud, that sort of advantage has been arbed away. The same you could argue in terms of the model, the subscription model isn't fancy. And so now you're at a point where you know, the arena, the arena is helped me do -- help me run my business. And when you're saying Atlassian, which has JIRA, Trello, a bunch of OpsGenie was a big part of your PagerDuty thesis, and then you asked…AR: Yeah, which we acquired in December.DS: Right. And you have Slack, which is at least to me, it seems like a bigger player in the room. I don't actually -- I don't recall all the revenues in that, but it seems like you're -- what you're arguing essentially, is that you're going to be fighting for a pie. And if you had to bet you're going to go with these Atlassian is already a wider play and Slack they're not competing directly, as you said, but they have wider plans. So something like PagerDuty, which is more of a specialist, it's going to be a harder for them to really defend what they're doing. I mean, is that essentially, what you're getting at for the thesis?AR: Well, I mean, if you look at the problem, PagerDuty is addressing, it's working in conjunction with these other tools. So as soon as the engineer picks up his phone, and clicks on the link to whatever alert, as soon as that alert is clicked on, right, I mean, you're ticketing the incident with JIRA Service Desk, you're on Slack, collaborating with other engineers, you're updating its status page. These other tools are already being used. Every operator has their own dashboards, if you're one of these big tech companies, if you're thinking like a Salesforce, or an Uber, or whatever.So they have the core functionality of the page, right, is working with these other tools. And I mean, that's part of what a PagerDuty anyway, needs to do well, or anyone who enters into that space is, okay, we need to seamlessly integrate with all the monitoring tools, we need to seamlessly integrate with your collaboration tools, we need to seamlessly integrate with your ITSM like service now or the -- your service desks like a JIRA and or even just JIRA Software from a project management standpoint.So what got me interested in that is that when you looked at it, and you're just like, this company has to position themselves as a platform, once they're a $5 billion company, they don't want to be dubbed the point product company, right? You read a short thesis. If you look at the story, it's a great story. It's a couple of young guys, right out of college, they go work at Amazon on e-commerce. They're on call. They leave Amazon. They're like, what kind of startup would be a good idea.They basically productized the pain point in what they learned at working in Amazon, because Amazon got there before everybody else did this infrastructure. But like, why hasn't Amazon productized this? Well, look at these guys. I mean, it took 11 years and all kinds of pricing changes to the point that their average revenue per user, is north of $30; Slack's probably in the $6 to $9 range, right?Most of all, Atlassian’s products are going to be in that same range. Microsoft Office, which gives you for God's sakes, PowerPoint, Word, Excel, the Enterprise Exchange, the storage teams, all that you can get that for $12 a month, right? So it's these guys priced right, they penetrated and I think one of the things they did really well was they go to Y Combinator, they graduate and you get Andreessen Horowitz, you get Axcel, you get Bessemer, you get these types of big name VCs invest in you, that allows you to get business at Fortune 500 companies, and for those competing against them, like what's the one thing I don't want with a paging system is I need to know that guy's going to be in business, right?I mean, OpsGenie, I think had 200k in the bank until they raised $10 million in 2016. And they were doing very well, with a very engineering heavy approach. They hadn't invested at all in sales, like it was a bunch of people in Turkey. He had like one or two guys in the U.S.So you're not going to walk into Disney and do that business, right? They're going to look at a company like PagerDuty and be like, oh, you have $100 million in the bank, and you've got Anderson and Axcel behind you, right. And that was a key part of that sales pitch.But then when Atlassian buys an OpsGenie, that changes the game, right? Forget what they're now doing with pricing. Because Atlassian’s approach here, it has to look at it PagerDuty, which is -- and Atlassian has done tons of acquisitions in the DevOps, like Chain, Overtime, and Collaboration, and so on and so forth. And then say, like, this company has to compete with us. They're going to want the minute that page -- that alert goes off, like, ultimately, you want to make it so that I don't go into Slack, I don't ticket outside, I don't do it in these other things. And ultimately IT departments and purchasing managers are going to look into where are we wasting money, right? How many of these tools can we possibly have?So if you're Atlassian, and a company like this has listed you're highly incentivized immediately to be very aggressive, because you don't want to be the next Skype being, or AOL Instant Messenger being relegated via Zoom, or a Slack, you want to make sure you protect your position. And if you look at this space, you can conclude a lot of these decisions were made last summer, that's when you get into an IPO. I mean, Atlassian didn't buy OpsGenie, without obviously looking at PagerDuty.So PagerDuty’s expectations without question were probably what Atlassian felt were very unrealistic, because they were looked at and said, well, look, once we buy them, we already overlap with all your customer base. So what's our customer acquisition cost? And if we're going to bundle this in, and I think, one of Atlassian’s Co-CEOs at a speech, even before they did OpsGenie, was talking about, essentially, what one day become a DevOps 365 bundle, look at it the same way as Microsoft Office, right?And we're taking Excel, and PowerPoint and these things and putting them together. And it's a productivity suite. And now it's a productivity suite for site reliability engineers, DevOps engineers, and what not. And that's where things get to the point today, where it's like, how big can certain markets be? And what type of pricing can you realize in those markets?Because that's a very interesting part of SaaS, pricing strategy now, is a really big deal. Because you can look at something like a PagerDuty and be like, well, I mean, is Microsoft just shooting themselves in the foot, like, are they giving away Office, Enterprise Edition, is Slack price way too low, like if 65%, 70% of my time is using Slack, but like the person who's routed me the page, it is realizing $5 per month more per user, sorry, not $5, month, 5x more per month per user, right?Those are like -- it's not like -- hey, you're going to have some pricing pressure, it's degrees of business models that are so different. If you look at what an average revenue per user at $30 is, and you see Atlassian, now sticking on the OpsGenie page, that they'll go down to $4.50 for 10,000 users.So it's like -- that's when you look at it, and you see strategically, and Atlassian is looking at a PagerDuty, and it's like, I want to reduce these guys. These guys have aspirations to be more than the really good point product they are today. And they work in a workflow with all our other tools. And the only way they get there is if they start displacing our other tools. So we understand the economics here, the average incident, and let's say in an SMS, a call and whatever, you're looking at maybe less than $0.04 per incident, you can price, based on data, both out of OpsGenie, and Pager Duty, you can price as low as $2 or $3, if you didn't have significant overhead, right?DS: Well, and that's where, just to jump in, like this is what seems to be the crux of what maybe what's changing too, it seems like is that, it's all you like you said, there's only so much business that can be had here. And when you're talking about these subscription businesses, you can talk about lowering your cost of acquisition, or you can talk about increasing your lifetime value, keeping your retention and whatever else. And some of that's pricing obviously, on both ends. But it seems like with Atlassian where they are -- they've already kind of kept a solid footing as a public company.I don't know whether or not they're profitable on a GAAP basis, or free cash flow basis. But they have, like you said a wider product suite. So they can afford, they have more market power to go after PagerDuty and say, all right, we're price more competitively, because it doesn't matter to us. We already have -- we're already in so many people's workflow. So it's going to not be that hard to get them on to this other product. But also, then once we get somebody in, we just have more to offer them, which then makes it more interesting to us. And then like you said, though, I think what at least we would use to argue makes software different is that the unit economics are so favorable, because like I don't -- I'm not going to do all the math.But if you're talking about $0.04 an incident, it seems like that's not a huge gross cost that you have to pay each time that you're booking a new sale as it were, like it gets really favorable once you lock people in, and the way to lock them in and to prevent switching is to be so useful in so many different places. So that they stick for hours PagerDuty isn't there yet? Is that -- am I understanding that right?AR: Yeah, I agree. Look, Atlassian was profitable when it listed. Atlassian is the last IPO that I have bought the day it went public, right. And I mean it's one that has -- it's been around for a while, obviously, with JIRA Software, and it's grown steadily. And it's look -- it's a great success story. But they've also been very aggressive with acquisitions lately. But I do think it's not even so much so that, like you look at this market, and you're asked the question of like, can Atlassian give it away, in terms of OpsGenie?Of course they can. And they do have a free tier, right? I think Atlassian looks at this market. And they're like, look, the core paging element is a commodity type of element. This is an orchestration collaboration problem. So what we are bringing to the table is a lot of like we have four to five pieces of it, but there was actually a good interview, maybe was this year or last year with either the OpsGenie CEO or VictorOps. I think it was the OpsGenie CEO, where he actually says, look, we looked at our -- where we were with our product, and like what we need to do and we have to start building the stuff that Atlassian already has.And like to horizontally, expand and improve our functionality. And that's essentially what PagerDuty has started to do. So if you go back to last summer, Atlassian was also competing with Slack. That's why the Slack IPO is also really interesting. And they sold the IP behind HipChat and Stride to Slack, exited that market, invested in them, and determined what, we're not going to bother where's the money to chase them here. And then what do they did do immediately, they bought OpsGenie. In that same window, PagerDuty changes the pricing structure. If you look at PagerDuty’s prospectus, you can see dollar based retention was going in the wrong direction, the first six months of 2018.And if your IP -- if you're planning an IPO Inc, those metrics have to be moving north, right before you list. And in September 1 they changed pricing to the point where, they removed some functionality. And I mean, this is funny, because you can go watch their head of pricing strategy, it's online, give a 60 minute talk, where they talk about pricing structure issues, and she literally says that, we want to show our customers that we're more of a platform company. And this is obviously coming at the end of the day, once you have the VCs the types you have in there, it's like you don't want to be dubbed a point product.So we need to show that we're taking care of more things, we're providing more value to you than routing this page. And what they did is they stripped out functionality that was already being provided in their $49 tier, and made those la carte things, or they bought, and they moved them over to the higher tier Enterprise Edition, and bundled them in there, right.So, in their minds, it's like, we were providing too much value to where we have most of our customers, and not enough value for our highest tier where we want to extract a premium price. And when you see those moves made, right, I mean, that effectively boosts everything as you're going into an IPO. And as they did that, OpsGenie has acquired Atlassian’s slashes prices by 40%. And then right as these guys list, Atlassian starts providing you high transparency and targeted attack on their website on the volume discounts and how low they're willing to go, which is essentially a strategy by them to thwart any potential platform aspirations that PagerDuty has.Then let's say monetizing the on call market and of itself, because where PagerDuty is today at, $117 million trailing revenue, with over a third of the Fortune 500, right, at an ARPU, let's call it $31. If you change those economics to $10 or $15, like, look how small the market is. I mean, there's a reason the U.S. hasn't got into this market, I mean, Amazon has Lambda for automation, and Python's for users that, like they have all the primitives, and they've been doing this themselves to build this product, integrated with Cloud Watch, integrated -- like provided to all AWS customers. And it's a small market, if the economics come in at the size of what a physical pager is going to be costing them off.But if you're making 3 to 4x, what Microsoft is getting for Office 365? Oh, yeah, it looks amazing. And that's where you get this element of that. There can be things in SaaS, where if they were native, and they had no other competitors, that price rate initially just seemed to get sticky at those pricing and can hold it.But now we're at this point where you have to look at it and say, well, what happens when the other large SaaS companies whose tools are adjacent to you look at your pricing and like this is and they're just like, okay, we have to blow this up, because these guys, the only place for them to go is into our markets and we're selling tools for a fraction of the price that are being used more in the day to day workflow than their tool.That's when you start looking at these things and you say what, this is a completely different business and people will be well why would you short this and be like, whatever? I'm like look, if everyone is going to be paying $30 per user, you might as well go get a pager again. I mean, at some point that you're going have to look at the economics and make that decision. But you're not going to get to that point, because every single person would be in that market by that point, all the giants would be in it. And that's when you look at in Atlassian and you say, well, they probably approached PagerDuty, PagerDuty being the leader, and PagerDuty, asking price was probably one where Atlassian was like, look, once we enter this space, the reliability issue that you guys have written as being backed with a $170 million and Andreessen and so and so as your VCs, no one's going to be worrying about us, they're already doing plenty of business with us.And we understand your pricing. We probably have a very good idea of what your largest customers are paying, where you're getting the majority of your seats, and how much you're over earning on your smaller customers. And all we need to do is put that on our webpage, and directly go at our already existing base in that manner. And that's very different from where we were, when we look at software companies that would this even a few years ago, but I mean, definitely five years ago, as Sixer -- when a workday comes out, and it's just like we’re going after Oracle, and PeopleSoft, and so on and so forth, and legacy on-prem. And this, like tech one point, viewed archaic way of doing things with a native cloud model.Now, the cloud guys are instantaneously competing against each other. I mean, even going back to the CrowdStrike, which you discussed, I mean, Blackberry (BB) did a deal, Elastic (ESTC) bought an endpoint company. I mean, there's another one that just raised money recently.I mean, there's so many of them. And that's when you look at PagerDuty, and you're like, all right, well, I mean, Splunk has bought this, Atlassian has got OpsGenie. There's open source alternatives in this. And I don't even really could view that as the biggest of a threat, to tell you the truth. I just look at it and I say, this is going to be a very simple case of pricing is going to be drastically different than where it's been. And it's happening in real time.I mean, this is the type of thing where once you have a thesis like this, then you just start talking to engineers, you start doing the calls, you start doing the research, and you go out and see whether or not it's vindicated. And in the process of doing that, for me, it was overwhelming when I found in the space going on now in real time, which is where you get interested in an IPO. Because what can a company that's gone public recently do, is drastically alter their pricing. Because you get like the investing community is going to be like, well, okay, well, let me what's going on here.I don't even think, looking at it, I don't think people have looked at the fact that they drastically changed the pricing structure in September. I mean, if you looked at the report there, there was, there's SaaStr, which is a blog, which I like and the guy behind it, Lemkin is a well-known SaaS person. He’s been call the godfather of SaaS.He did a PagerDuty post, titled it's about pricing and is PagerDuty expensive and whatnot. And like he opens it with the question is like, do these guys, double their pricing like Dropbox (DBX)? Or did they effectively increase it by changing their tiers? He asked three or four questions, right. And he immediately concluded PagerDuty had done none of those. And they just kind of figured out pricing from day one, in a very lazy fashion, to be honest, because if you go look at it empirically, it's changed drastically multiple times, right? And even just now recently, and you've got their head of pricing, giving a 55 minute talk, talking about pricing structure issues, and you're like, how can this happen?That's when you get to this, euphoria element in the market, right? Because that guy of all people should know better. He can look closely, he has the access, obviously, in the venture capital community, what people want -- like when, when these stories have been working, there is a confirmation bias, right?Let’s look at all these successes in software. And as you look at something on the surface, that seems so obvious. And it's like, look, not only have they done, what Dropbox did, and what this guy, they’re guilty of every one of them. They've changed the tier, they stripped things out, they've actually significantly increased pricing over time, every single little thing here that you should -- that you were looking at and saying, which is a common theme around PagerDuty, I mean, if you do talk to people who use the product, they're happy with the product.If you talk to the people on the pricing side, they're like, it's really, really expensive. I mean, I've talked to some people who've switched to OpsGenie, and even VictorOps, and they're just like, we were a little bit worried initially. And then after two weeks, nobody noticed the difference. And then if you look at some of the biggest tech companies, where I think PagerDuty has built a good brand equity. And particularly in that Silicon Valley Community, they're not using any of these add-on features.It's core reliable Page, which actually is not the worst thing for them, because it's like, why switch, right? If you do that one thing really well and for the biggest customers, obviously, that they're giving them huge volume discounts. All I got to do is continue doing that well. And I'm fine and I'm going to be in a good position with my customer base. The problem is, well, your competitors sold for $100 million and $200 million and you're trading at $5 billion. And they're now both owned by $20 billion plus software companies. And these guys are looking at that market and saying, well, okay, you're going to have ambitions because like Atlassian’s management has executed and grown adjacently overtime.They know that if you have a nice market cap and the market starts to overvalue, you can sell that story, then maybe you can do a deal here, you can do a deal there, and you can turn it into something bigger."

Pre-acquisition Qualtrics International was last valued at $2.5 billion and was rumored to be going in for an IPO at $6 billion, before getting bought out at $8 billion. Adobe has a market cap of ~$120 billion and a potential acquisition could happen at $220 billion. Qualtrics and Adobe are both plays on the experience business and thus comparable to TEAM.However, on the valuations, things look very different.TEAM’s revenue is expected to grow 25-30% over the next few years, which should lead to doubling of revenues every 3 years from the last year’s $870 million.At the current market cap of $20 billion, TEAM already trades at over 20x revenue. The risks arising from the company’s ‘low-cost selling – high-intensity sales focused R&D (bordering on privacy violations)’, the relatively low EBITDA margins, high SBC expense (over $60K per employee per year) and high valuations leave no room for error on the execution front.

4235763,104608,2019-01-26T04:19:21-05:00,"Atlassian currently trades at pre-correction highs as investors continue to love this growth story.Q2 earnings showed industry leading gross and operating margins for a company growing revenue nearly 40%.Over the long term, this is a clear winner, but valuation remains a bit elevated at current levels.","Atlassian (TEAM) continues their habitual quarterly earnings report of beat and raise. This time, the stock popped more than 10% in after-hours trading before settling down over the past few days. The stock currently trades near their pre-correction high, a very positive sign for a tech company considering the vast majority of tech names are still well below pre-correction highs.Atlassian is one of the leading workflow and collaboration software vendors, based in Australia. Their most recent quarterly earnings showed revenue growth accelerating ~200 bps from Q1 with continued strength in their cash flow and balance sheet.Data by YChartsSince rising to $95+ in early October, Atlassian is roughly flat during that time. However, the stock experienced a rather dramatic ~30% plunge through November. The name was beaten down more than a majority of software names and rightfully so. Atlassian has historically traded a premium revenue multiple and a correction for this name was likely long overdue.However, the stock has since recovered from the pre-correction highs and coming off a strong earnings report, the name remains favorable to investors. I like this name a lot over the long term, though I remain cautious due to their continued elevated valuation metrics.Atlassian posted a very strong Q2 report which some investors were fearful of heading into given the recent market correction and worries over a global economic slowdown. Revenues grew 39% y/y, reaching $299 million and well above consensus estimates for $288 million (34% y/y growth). Many investors immediately backed this name which sent shares up over 10% after hours, a sign investors are still willing to pay up for quality high growth names.Source: Company PresentationThe 39% y/y revenue growth was largely driven by subscription based revenue, which grew 56% y/y in Q2. This type of revenue is very healthy for software companies because management typically has great insight and predictability to these revenue streams. Maintenance revenue also performed nicely, growing 21% y/y.The large revenue beat this quarter was likely a combination of these two as well as perpetual license growing 20% y/y, accelerating from 12% y/y growth in Q1. With perpetual licenses, the company receives a larger dollar value of revenue upfront. This type of revenue steam is rather lumpy and management does not have as great of insight into as they do with subscription revenue.Source: Company PresentationGross profit continues to increase nicely from already impressive levels. In Q2, gross margin reached 87%, an improvement from 86% in Q1. In fact, Q2 gross margin was the highest in company history and is the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Atlassian's ability to retain these high levels of gross margin has two large impacts.First, investors are more willing to pay up for a company with high revenue growth (39% in Q2) and high gross margins (87% in Q2). While these types of companies are almost always software-based companies, Atlassian's performance is among the best in the market. Second, higher gross margins means the company has more flexibility in operating expenses, such as R&D and S&M. The more a company can invest into these areas of their business likely means the greater chance at long-term success.Source: Company PresentationAnother main driver for the outperformance in Q2 is due to Atlassian's growing customer base. In Q2 alone, the company added almost 7,000 net new customers, a growth rate of 23% y/y. As the company continues to expand their customer base, they will have more success reaching different areas of the market and expand further internationally.Management also provided raised guidance with revenue in the range of $1.195-1.999 billion, well above consensus estimates for $1.180 billion. The raised guidance further demonstrates management's ability to operate and maintain revenue growth at such a high pace. As the company continues to grow their subscription revenue base and gain new customers, they will be able to drive strong top line results for many quarters to come.The 86% gross margin target is similar to what Atlassian has seen in their first two quarters and it would not be overly shocking if at the end of the year gross margin was closer to 87%. This leads to very solid operating margin guidance of 20-20.5% and EPS of $0.81-0.82.In addition, management remains confident in their ability to generate free cash flow of $370-380 million, representing a free cash flow margin of ~29-31%, on the high end of software companies which consistently grow revenue 35%+.While some investors are all-in on this strong growth name, I am a bit more cautious due to valuation. I agree Atlassian should be trading at a premium to the market and their peers; however, despite the recent correction, the stock currently trades at pre-correction highs. Valuation was hit pretty hard during October/November, with the stock dropping ~30% but investors have had a short memory of this and valuation continues to rise.Atlassian's current forward revenue valuation stands at ~18x, well above typically software vendors. A majority of software players currently trade in the 8-10x forward revenue area, and although there are some outliers, these are more of the exception.Data by YChartsCurrently, the stock is priced to perform exceptionally well for the remainder of the year. Investors are likely baking in a beat and raise Q3 report and a very strong Q4 report. To be clear, I am not by any means bearish on this name, I am just not advising investors to build a position at these levels. As revenue growth inevitably decelerates over the next few years, I will be looking at operating and free cash flow margin expansion.If Atlassian is able to continue their successful revenue growth while maintaining current 85%+ gross margins and low 20% operating margins, this stock will continue to rise. With this name comes some extra volatility. When the market is weak, typically higher valuation names are the first ones to take the largest hit. However, over the long term, Atlassian continues to prove they are a long-term winner and deserving of a premium valuation.I think in the short to mid-term, there are better areas in technology and software to invest which could yield a higher return. But for those already invested in Atlassian, I would keep my positions and remain a happy shareholder."

Atlassian is one of the most consistent earnings performers within the software industry, and one of the most regular beneficiaries of a double-digit post-earnings stock jump. Buoyed by a vigorous pace of growth (which accelerated two points sequentially from last quarter's growth rates) as well as continued robust cash flows, investors sent shares of Atlassian up more than 10% in after-hours trading:TEAM data by YChartsLet's cut to the chase: I've been bearish on Atlassian for a while, especially after last quarter's earnings print. I cautioned back then on the stock's overheated valuation. True enough, shares of Atlassian fell 30% peak-to-trough in the month of October, as investors became cautious on richly valued growth names.We have to wonder where that skepticism has gone. Despite a healthy recovery in the early weeks of January, the IGV Software Index (IGV) is still down more than 10% from its peak, and many individual small and mid-cap software stocks are 20% or 30% below peak values. In contrast, Atlassian has reached a new all-time high above $100.IGV data by YChartsDoes Atlassian deserve some of this premium? Certainly. But when the stock continues to be one of the most expensive names in software, I'd be careful about being too bullish on this name regardless of its performance. Trading at ~18x forward revenues, Atlassian is essentially priced for perfection - and its high valuation also makes it extremely subject to large volatility, as we saw in the months of October and December.The chart below compares how Atlassian is currently trading relative to other software stocks in the ~40% growth tier. As can be seen, Atlassian's valuation is a clear outlier, with most peers trading in the ~9-11x forward revenue range. Amid a volatile market that is shunning growth stocks, even a 10x forward revenue multiple can be considered steep.TEAM EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsTaking a bearish stance on a company that has such a strong track record is an unpopular position to hold. However, when the valuation spread between Atlassian and its peers is so wide, we have to approach the stock with a healthy dose of skepticism and a willingness to rotate our investments into similar, but cheaper-priced stocks.Let's dive deeper into Atlassian's second-quarter results and why investors are so bullish on the quarterly print. The company's earnings summary is below:Figure 1. Atlassian 2Q19 resultsSource: Atlassian Q2 investor letterRevenues soared to $299.0 million, up 39% y/y and smashing Wall Street's consensus of $288.3 million (+34% y/y) by a solid five-point margin. So far this quarter, earnings results have been rather muted across industries - with sectors like retail, airlines, and financials all showing signs of top-line slowdown. Atlassian was one of the first software companies to report results this quarter, and the healthy beat to Wall Street's consensus was a strong bullish signal in a quarter where many investors were fearful.Drivers for this quarter's strength were multifold. Atlassian continued to widen its customer base, adding nearly 7k in net new customers for the quarter and growing the base by 23% y/y relative to the year-ago Q2.Figure 2. Atlassian customersSource: Atlassian Q2 investor letterThe company is also seeing tremendous success with its Atlassian Marketplace, which is a sort of Atlassian-linked app store for third-party extensions on which Atlassian collects a royalty. Many large-cap success stories in the software sector, like Salesforce.com (CRM), have widened their ecosystem and captured an entirely new revenue stream from app sales. For Atlassian, Marketplace revenue growth of 58% y/y far outstripped overall revenue growth.It's worth noting as well that Atlassian has successfully executed a series of price increases. James Beer, Atlassian's CFO, noted on the Q2 earnings call that ""I'm pleased with the overall (customer) reaction to the price increases,"" noting that the increases were also accompanied by notable improvements in product and service quality. Needless to say, the growth in the customer base plus an increase in average subscription sizes tremendously benefitted revenue growth.Perhaps what investors were most optimistic about, however, was Atlassian's raised guidance targets. The company has lifted its full-year revenue outlook to $1.195-$1.199 billion in revenues, sufficiently above Wall Street consensus of $1.18 billion.Figure 3. Atlassian guidance updateSource: Atlassian Q2 investor letterThe company has also committed to a robust cash flow picture of $370-$380 million - which, at the midpoint, represents a huge FCF margin of 31% (one of the highest in the software sector).Needless to say, the bullish cash flow outlook also is accompanied by strong results in the current quarter. Atlassian grew FCF in Q2 to $122.3 million, up nearly 2x from 2Q18 FCF of $67.8 million.Partially driving this jump is a boost in gross margins, up 340 bps to 83.3%. Atlassian already had some of the highest gross margins in the software sector - with its margin profile now in the mid-80s, nearly every incremental dollar of revenues to Atlassian flows to the bottom line. Efficiencies on the operating expense side - including on sales and marketing - also helped to drive operating margins up by five points.Figure 4. Atlassian FCF, margins, and other key metricsSource: Atlassian Q2 investor letterBuoyed both by stronger-than-expected revenue growth and a healthy improvement in gross and operating margins, Atlassian managed to drive pro forma EPS of $0.25, which represents a 19% upside surprise relative to Wall Street consensus of $0.21. Atlassian, unlike many of its software counterparts, has reached both IFRS and non-IFRS profitability - which is partially the reason that investors are incredibly bullish on this stock.There's no denying that Atlassian remains a unique software asset with multiple growing product lines and a consistent tendency to drive higher margins and cash flows. Most small and mid-cap software companies are able to achieve one or the other - growth or profitability. Atlassian, on the other hand, drives excellent results on both fronts.Where Atlassian's appeal diminishes, however, is in its valuation. It trades many multiples ahead of its closest peers, and especially amid a cautious market environment that has rotated more into value-oriented stocks, Atlassian remains ripe for profit-taking. In my view, I'd continue to sit on the sidelines and invest elsewhere."

Atlassian is trading at 17x forward sales, with competitors trading at 1.8x-9.6x forward sales. They have somewhat similar revenue growth and gross profit margin. However, Atlassian numbers are a bit better as compared to those of its peers. Nevertheless, investors should not be able to justify the difference between the company’s valuation and that of competitors. The company’s numbers don’t seem that better.Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Australia, Atlassian Corporation develops and markets software that helps teams organize, discuss and complete their tasks.Source: Company’s WebsiteAtlassian commenced its business of developing platforms to help software teams work together in a befitting manner. With this accumulated expertise, the company initiated other projects that involved different industries. Right now, the company brings products for teams focused on sales and marketing to HR, finance, and legal matters.In 2019, clients can choose from a list of different products including JIRA for project management, HipChat which supports team conversations, Bitbucket for code sharing, or JIRA Service Desk for supporting applications. A list of all the products is given below:Source: Company’s WebsiteThe investors who may not know the company and its products should keep the following information in mind. Atlassian’s products were used by NASA to go to Mars or by Cochlear for designing aural implants.The company reported total revenues of $267 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, 37% more than the figure reported in the same time period in 2017. In addition, the gross profit margin is quite large. In the three months ended September 30, 2018, the gross profit was equal to $222 million. Atlassian is not reporting positive net income, which growth investors will not really care about. The revenue growth and the gross profit margin are the most relevant on this name. If these two figures continue to be very appealing, shareholders and growth investors will be pleased. The image below provides the results reported in the most recent quarterly release:Source: 10-QThe financial profile reported in 10-k filings is also quite encouraging. The amount of revenues increased from $215 million in 2014 to $873 million in the year ended June 30, 2018. Additionally, the gross profit has been quite terrific. In 2018, the company reported gross profit of $701 million. As mentioned above, with such a greate net income, who cares about these losses when the company is growing revenues at 41% y/y. The image below provides further details on this matter:Source: 10-KInvestors will also appreciate the company’s balance sheet. Atlassian has what every investors is looking for, tons of cash. Most precisely, as of September 30, 2018, the company reported $1.517 billion in cash, which represents 59% of the total amount of assets. Investors may not like the amount of goodwill and intangibles reported. Keep in mind that accountants have many times issues while assessing the value of intangible assets, and sometimes they can get impaired. With that, the amount of goodwill and intangible assets only comprise of 14% of the total amount of assets.

Additionally, the company seems to be financing its activities at a rate what investors may believe very low. The Exchangeable Senior notes include payment of 0.625% interest rate. Furthermore, Atlassian has in cash enough money to pay these obligations when they are due; May 1, 2023.

The image below provides further details on this matter:Source: 10-QOn the one side, the assessment of shareholders is quite beneficial. Many well known institutional investors decided to trust the company, which include FMR, Janus, T. Rowe Price, and Artisan among others. Many more shareholders will study the company’s business model after seeing that these money managers own shares. The image below provides further details on this matter:Source: 10-KOn the contrary, Atlassian has two types of shares, which will be appreciated by investors. Institutional investors are buying class A shares, which have the right to one vote. However, the management, the CEO and directors own class B shares, which provide 10 votes per share. As a result, the company is controlled by a few shareholders. The lines below and the image below provide further details on this matter:Source: 10-KThe investors who may not understand what means that a few shareholders control more than 90% of the voting power should read very carefully what follows. If the controlling shareholders are willing to do so, they could elect an independent Board of Directors, which could take decisions to benefit the largest stockholders. In this case, minority shareholders would not be that protected. With that said, please note that as of January 18, 2019, the Board of Directors consists of nine members, and the majority seems to be independent.

Assuming forward revenues of $1.2 billion, Atlassian trades at 17x forward sales.Regarding the company’s peers, Atlassian mentions several names including Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), HP (HPE), Rally Software, ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW), Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM), Zendesk (ZEN), BMC Software, and Google (GOOG). The lines below provide further details on this matter:Source: 10-KCompetitors are not growing revenues like Atlassian.

As shown in the image below, the gross profit margin of Atlassian is 81% with peers having gross profit margin of 76%-30%.Source: YchartsTaking a look at the EV/Sales ratio of peers, Atlassian seems quite expensive. Peers are trading at 1.8x-9.6x forward sales with Atlassian trading at 17x forward sales. It is fair that Atlassian trades at a higher valuation as it has larger revenue growth and more gross profit margin. However, the difference in valuation seems too large. Investors should not be able to justify such a large difference. Keep in mind that the company’s ratio is trading at more than 1.8x the ratio of the second most expensive name, ServiceNow. The image below provides further details on this matter:Source: YchartsOn January 17, 2019, the company released its figures for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. It was very positive that Atlassian was able to report better than expected revenue of $299.0 million, up by 39% year-over-year. In addition, the net income was positive, equal to $45.2 million, which is very beneficial. The company was reporting losses before. It does not matter that Atlassian continues to surprise the market. Its revenue growth does not seem to justify paying 17x forward sales.Developing extremely successful products that are making revenue grow at 41% y/y, Atlassian’s business model is quite appealing. The only issue, the most relevant, is the share price. It is too expensive. The shares of company are trading at 17x forward sales with peers trading at 1.8x-9.6x forward sales. Atlassian should have a higher valuation than peers. However, investors should not be able to justify the large difference. Atlassian and its peers have somewhat similar revenue growth and gross profit margin. Atlassian’s figures are better than that of competitors, but no that better. As of today, the company seems like a sell."
4223288,104702,2018-11-19T13:14:23-05:00,"Atlassian has one of the best fundamental stories in software with its focus on developers and unique customer acquisition strategy.As a standalone company, the growth opportunity is gigantic with only 1% penetration in its end markets. The stock is also an attractive acquisition candidate.A significant tailwind is that the number of developers is expected to grow by 24% per year through 2026.Valuation is high but justified by growth prospects and acquisition premium.","The bull case for Atlassian (TEAM) is anchored around several compelling themes. First, the company makes software products primarily for developers which practically live on TEAM's products. Software developer is one of the fastest growing occupations in the US which the Bureau of Labor statistics estimates will growth 24% annually through 2026. Second, TEAM has a unique freemium business model which has enabled rapid revenue growth at a low cost of sales and marketing as a percent of revenue. Third, the relatively low price of its software and large customer base makes it a valuable acquisition for a large enterprise software or cloud provider to gain customers which could be sold other high priced services. At face value, the elevated valuation of TEAM may give some investors angina. However given the growth opportunity and potential strategic value to acquirers with deep pockets, the valuation is justified. The recent price decline is an opportunity to buy the stock below is recent peak. Since going public in late 2015, TEAM has missed the consensus forecast only one time before in March 2018 when they reported Q3 FY18 earnings. When that happened, the stock dropped more than 12% only to rebound and reach all-time-high 2 weeks later. Moreover, since that Q3 earnings drop, the stock rallied close to 80% when it reached all-time-high this fall around $97 before the general market selloff brought it down.The recent earnings report was a mixed bag. The company beat both on top and bottom line with the revenues coming in 3% above the 34% yoy growth consensus and 33-34% guidance. The Q2 FY19 guidance (+34% to +35% yoy) was also above the 32% consensus. However, deferred revenue fell below the consensus forecast, coming in at $365mn versus the Street at $377m. Analysts look at deferred revenue in SAAS companies as one of the main barometers for future growth. However the miss was small and can be explained normal business volatility. The reaction of the stock was exacerbated by the risk-off environment. Source: KoyfinAtlassian main product is Jira, which is used for issue tracking and project management among developers. Jira covers the entire development life cycle from outlining the project requirements, breaking down the project into smaller pieces, and allowing all stakeholders to manage the tasks as the project is built from start to finish. With 4.5/5 stars from more than 4000 users on SoftwareAdvice, a leading software review website, what separates Jira from its competitors is the ease of access and its agility. From a small startup to large enterprises, teams of all sizes across industries can use Jira to manage projects and integrate Jira with other platforms like Salesforce, Sales Cloud, and GitHub. They can also deploy it on multiple operating systems and allow the users to choose between hosting their own server or use Atlassian cloud platform through AWS.Beyond Jira, TEAM has other products that aid in project management like Confluence, Trello, and bitbucket. All three of these further compliments Jira and are also stand alone product on their own. TEAM also made a push into the DevOps market with the acquisition of OpsGenie in the last quarter. Below is a useful chart from GS explaining the main products of TEAM, market size and competitors. Source: Goldman SachsA unique characteristic of the company is its high spend on research and development (R&D) to create a leading product and low spend on sales and marketing (S&M). TEAM ranks at the bottom of the industry for S&M as % of revenue, and top for R&D as % revenue (see below). Unlike a traditional software company, Atlassian does not have the traditional enterprise software sales model. Instead, it utilizes a unique e-commerce business model focuses on efficient acquisition of customers through self service and disruptive pricing. Source: Company presentationsAll the products are free to try and the pricing information is available online. This self-service online business model also allows for low-friction customer acquisition that ultimately contributes to Atlassian’s high customer volume. Users seems to like the offering as evidenced by the 98% retention rate over the last three fiscal years. In addition to the high retention rate, the recurring revenue share of total revenue is also going up as well from 77% in FY15 to 82% in FY17.The valuation of the stock is the most controversial part of the bull case. At 18x on a Price / Sales (ntm) basis the stock is one of the most expensive in SAAS. However, the current high valuation will likely persist because of the strong fundamental drivers, large market opportunity and takeover premium that exists because the asset is valuable for large-cap tech companies. Source: KoyfinNormalizing for growth, the valuation is in-line with other SAAS companies. On a PEG basis, the stock trades at 3.5x which is in the middle of other SAAS startups. Source: KoyfinIn the current heated tech M&A environment, Atlassian is a prime candidate for acquisition by a large-tech company. In particular, one of the large cloud computing providers, Amazon, Alphabet (Google) or Microsoft, could use the relationship TEAM has with developers across thousands of companies to sell cloud products. These large-cap cloud providers have ample capacity to acquire TEAM for $25B which would equal a 40% premium to the current market cap. Alphabet is the most likely candidate because it's a distant third in the cloud business and has $106B of cash. Microsoft is less likely than Alphabet because of its traditional focus on enterprise, but still the company has $136B of cash. Amazon is the least likely among the 3 cloud providers and has the least amount of cash at $30B but still enough to cover an acquisition (or issue debt to complete it). 2018 has been a banner year for large companies paying high multiples for valuable tech assets. Microsoft/Github, SAP/Qualtrics and Salesforce/Mulesoft happened at more than 20x trailing sales. For reference, TEAM currently trades at 18x trailing sales. Source: KoyfinThe current market sell-off and mixed 3Q earnings have created an opportunity for investors to buy TEAM for 30% less than where the shares were trading at the start of October. Investors should take advantage of this opportunity. The company has tremendous organic growth prospects and represents an attractive acquisition candidate for many cash-rich tech companies.

4235122,20521,2019-01-23T19:32:13-05:00,"Atlassian appears to recognize the market potential in acquiring smaller startups to get to the next level.Earlier last year, it had announced the $295 million acquisition of OpsGenie.Atlassian also recently announced the acquisition of bootstrapped startup Butler for Trello for an undisclosed sum.","According to a recent MarketsAndMarkets report, the global enterprise collaboration software market is estimated to grow 11% annually over the next five years to $59.86 billion by 2023 from $34.57 billion in 2018. Billion-Dollar Unicorn Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a leading service provider in this market, which delivered a stellar quarterly performance recently.Atlassian's second quarter revenues grew 39% over the year to $299 million, compared with the market's forecast of $288.3 million. It reported an adjusted EPS of $0.25, which also was significantly better than the Street's estimated $0.21 for the quarter. This was the fourth consecutive quarter that Atlassian surpassed market expectations.By segment, revenues from subscription services grew 56% to $152.5 million, ahead of the Street's estimated $150 million. Revenues from the maintenance segment grew 21% to $97.16 million. Perpetual License revenues reported a 20% growth to $25.8 million. Other revenues grew 58% to $23.45 million.This was the first calendar year that Atlassian clocked in revenues of more than a billion dollars. It had recorded revenues of $873.95 million in the last fiscal year. Its flagship product Jira Software surpassed 65,000 customers and ended the quarter with more than 138,000 total customers.For the current quarter, Atlassian expects revenues of $303-$305 million and a non-IFRS EPS of $0.18. It expects to end the year with revenues of $1.195-$1.199 billion and non-IFRS EPS of $0.81-$0.82. The Street was looking for revenues of $300.7 million and an EPS of $0.17 for the quarter.Atlassian appears to recognize the market potential in acquiring smaller startups to get to the next level. Earlier last year, it had announced the $295 million acquisition of OpsGenie. Virginia-based OpsGenie's platform helped companies better plan for and respond to software and website service disruptions by quickly routing alerts to the appropriate IT teams. Prior to the acquisition, OpsGenie was privately held and, according to Crunchbase, had raised $10 million from Battery Ventures at an undisclosed valuation in 2016. This is a very interesting case in point vis-a-vis my recent article, Bootstrapping to Exit, where I point out that capital-efficient startups are appealing for larger companies to acquire.Continuing with the inorganic growth strategy, Atlassian recently announced the acquisition of bootstrapped startup Butler for Trello for an undisclosed sum. Dover, Delaware-based Butler for Trello was developed by Ludable in 2016. Trello, which had raised funding for $10.3 million, was acquired for $425 million by Atlassian in 2017 and is now Atlassian's powerful project management offering. Trello is known to be a very flexible platform, but it's prone to becoming a tedious platform due to the mundane and repetitive tasks that users have to perform on it.Unlike Siri Shortcuts or Zapier, Trello does not offer an option to automate some of these routine tasks. To address this gap, Oscar Triscon developed Butler for Trello. It was built as a rules-based system that allows Trello users to program routines and processes using natural language. Today, it allows users to consolidate multiple steps into one, and assign rules such as user assignments or status change based on identifiable triggers. Butler's solutions have been available to Trello users as a Power-up option. Analysts estimate that post the acquisition, some of these features will now come in-built into the Trello platform.Atlassian appears to have caught on to the phenomenon of acquiring smaller startups that deliver product-market fit and strategic alignment to its core operations. Butler for Trello is one such example of acquiring a company that can add the much needed natural language processing capabilities to its project management service.Some of the other acquisitions on similar lines include Hall, an all-in-one unified communications app that Atlassian acquired in 2015 for an estimated $20 million. Hall was privately held and had raised $6 million in funding prior to the acquisition. In 2014, Atlassian had acquired bootstrapped startup doctape for an estimated $7.5 million. doctape lets users view and organize files in the browser, including a wide range of different document, image, video and audio formats without a local software installation. What other such capabilities do you think Atlassian could benefit from acquiring?Atlassian's stock is trading at $91.44 with a market capitalization of $21.7 billion. It had touched a 52-week high of $100 earlier this week. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $47.74 that it had fallen to in January last year."
4245573,104608,2019-03-01T01:56:18-05:00,"Atlassian posted another very strong quarter, easily surpassing consensus estimates.Raised guidance demonstrates management's continued belief in revenue growth trajectory and long-term profitability potential.Valuation remains a bit pricy with the stock at all-time high levels, with a limited amount of software peers trading near Atlassian's valuation.","Atlassian (TEAM) continues to demonstrate its earnings consistency by reporting another strong quarterly report. Revenue growth accelerated once again and investors awarded the stock rightfully so, sending the shares up 10% the following day.Atlassian is an Australia-based software vendor which specializes in workflow and collaboration tools. Its shares have been exceptionally strong over the past few quarters despite all of the market turbulence, especially within the software industry as valuations appeared to have run a bit too high.Data by YChartsAtlassian has been a great stock to own over the past year, generating significant alpha against the market. This has been one of the fastest growing software names in the market, and valuation has shown this to be the case. Investors are constantly willing to pay a premium multiple for this name due to their earnings consistently and ability to consistently beat top and bottom line consensus estimates.However, the stock has run up quite a bit over the past few months and it seems like valuation is again right where it used to be before the market correction. A majority of the market has been somewhat stagnant lately as investors are waiting to see what multiples they are willing to pay for these faster-growth software names. Atlassian, however, continues to buck this trend and continues its upward momentum.Data by YChartsRevenue growth again came in well ahead of consensus estimates. Revenue for Q2 was $299 million, growing 38% y/y and was well ahead of consensus estimates for $288 million, or 34% y/y growth. Despite the overall fears with software companies reporting revenue growth either below or in line with consensus estimate, Atlassian was able to clearly beat this trend. Being one of the first software companies to report earnings earlier this year, investors immediately rewarded the name and sent the shares up 10% the following day.Source: Company PresentationDuring the quarter, Atlassian noted several growth drivers. For example, Atlassian grew the numbers of customers by nearly 7,000, a growth rate of just under 25% y/y.The company has also been successful at executing some price increases. Typically with these higher growth software names, the companies are less likely to pass along price increases to customers as the companies prefer to continue to grow their revenue base at a fast clip. However, during the Q2 conference call, management discussed the company's ability to successfully pass some price increases to its customers, which has seen a positive reception in the marketplace. As the customer base continues to expand in size and average subscription rate, Atlassian has set itself up for a very successful run-rate for revenue growth potential.In addition, Atlassian Marketplace continues to see great success. The Marketplace is essentially an App Store for third-party extensions in which Atlassian receives a royalty payment for hosting these applications. Revenue growth in this area grew at an impressive 58% y/y and continues to outpace the overall revenue growth of the company. As the Marketplace continues to grow at these high rates, the revenue base from this will begin to have a more meaningful impact to revenue upside for the quarter.Source: Company PresentationAs a result of the very strong quarter, Atlassian also raised its guidance for the full year. Revenue is now expected to be $1,195-1,199 million, which was well above consensus estimates for just under $1,200 million. I believe there continues to be upside to its revenue guidance as management is likely to remain somewhat conservative given the company's fast growth rate.Free cash flow is expected to come in around $370-380 million, which represents a margin of 31% at the midpoint. Going by the rule of 40, Atlassian is one of the highest revenue growth/FCF margin software companies I can think of. Once revenue inevitably begins to decelerate, though I believe this could be a few years away from meaningful deceleration, I believe FCF margin will continue to expand and the company will become one of the strongest FCF generators in the market.Gross margin continues to remain near the high-end of software companies. Typically, high-quality software companies have gross margins in the 80s and Atlassian is no different. Essentially, the software aspect of the company drives very high incremental margins which will naturally end up going directly to the bottom line. This is why as the company begins to spend less on S&M and R&D expenses as revenue begins to slow, its margins will naturally see a lift, causing earnings and cash flow margin to expand.Atlassian continues to be a challenging name to value largely due to the lack of a clear peer group when it comes to valuation. Even when looking at some of the highest quality software companies with high revenue growth rates, it is challenging to find a peer group which suggests Atlassian is undervalued.Data by YChartsThe chart above shows a handful of software tech names that have a very high revenue growth rate and potential to become market leaders in their respective industries. As you can see, Atlassian has continued to trade at the high end of this peer group over the past year. The only name trading at a higher premium valuation I could find was Zscaler (ZS), which just posted a very strong quarter of revenue growth, which easily surpassed consensus estimates. But that story is for another article yet to come.With the stock trading at all-time highs and valuation still well above its high-growth software technology peer group, it is challenging to suggest the stock will continue on its upward trend. Although I do believe in the long-term viability of the company and think investors who already have a position built in this name should continue to hold, I am not sure if now is the best time to begin to build a position or add to your current holdings.Risks to Atlassian include revenue growth deceleration and valuation. If revenue growth unexpectedly decelerates, investors could be quick to take money off the table, especially considering the very high valuation it currently trades at."

The market is dominated by large enterprises, but the growth in SME adoption is expected to grow at a higher rate in the coming years as these companies move to SaaS-based technologies as well. A leading player in the market is Billion-Dollar Unicorn Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM), which is growing fast to bring in over a billion dollars in annual revenue.Atlassian recently announced its first-quarter results for fiscal 2019. Revenues for the quarter grew an impressive 37% over the year to $267.3 million. The market was looking for revenues of $260 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.20 also was better than the Street's estimated $0.19. But on a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss of $242.4 million due to revaluation of debts.By segment, revenues from subscription services grew 55% to $134.1 million and maintenance segment grew 22% to $92.7 million. Perpetual License revenues reported a 12% growth to $21.8 million and Other was up 39% to $18.7 million.Among operating metrics, it ended the quarter with a total customer count, on an active subscription or maintenance agreement basis, of 131,684, an addition of nearly 5,890 net new customers during the quarter.For the current quarter, Atlassian expects revenues of $287-289 million and a non-IFRS EPS of $0.21. It expects to end the year with revenues of $1.175-1.183 billion and non-IFRS EPS of $0.78. The Street was looking for revenues of $281 million and an EPS of $0.20 for the quarter.Atlassian has been reorganizing its business portfolio to diversify its market offerings. Recently, it sold its corporate team chat businesses to Slack Technologies. The sale included the IP for its Stride and Hip Chat offering for an undisclosed sum. Atlassian had been in the messaging market for over six years and was facing significant competition from players like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has been expanding aggressively in the market. Earlier this year, Microsoft had launched its workplace collaboration tool Team.Atlassian instead now plans to focus its efforts on the IT operations segment. As part of this effort, it recently introduced Jira Ops, an end-to-end incident management platform that will serve as a unified incident command center for IT and software teams. It will act as the central place for these teams to coordinate work during an incident. The service comes pre-integrated with other web incident management apps, including Slack, PagerDuty, StatusPage, xMatters, and OpsGenie.To further strengthen the offering, Atlassian also announced the $295 million acquisition of OpsGenie. Falls Church, Virginia-based OpsGenie was founded in 2012 to build a platform that helps companies to better plan for and respond to software and website service disruptions. When the system detects an outage, OpsGenie's platform quickly routes alerts the appropriate IT teams, thus accelerating diagnosis, resolution and reducing downtime. It was a privately held company and did not disclose its financials. According to Crunchbase, it had raised $10 million from Battery Ventures at an undisclosed valuation in 2016.Through the acquisition, Atlassian will have access to OpsGenie's more than 3,000 customers, including names like Expedia and 7Eleven. While both Jira Ops and OpsGenie's products are currently separate, Atlassian plans to bring them together soon. It plans to use OpsGenie's alert system to work with Jira Ops and Atlassian's Statuspage product so as to communicate with employees and customers about downtime.Atlassian already has other products lined up that cater to the IT market. BitBucket is its code management repository, StatusPage is the status notification tool, Jira Software acts as a project management offering, and Jira Service Desk is its IT service management offering. The new addition of OpsGenie and Jira Ops add incident alert and management capabilities to its comprehensive portfolio.Gartner estimates that the IT operations market will be a $38 billion industry by 2022. Currently, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) dominates the industry with an estimated 40% market share. But Atlassian's bold measures are bringing it in direct competition. Atlassian believes that it will have advantage over ServiceNow on account of its cheaper price point.I would like to know from users if they would be willing to drop ServiceNow for Atlassian's offering? What is it that Atlassian will need to do differently to gain market share from ServiceNow?Atlassian's stock is trading at $70.18 with a market capitalization of $16.6 billion. It had peaked to a 52-week high of $98.21 earlier last month and has recovered from the 52-week low of $43.11 that it had fallen to in December last year. While the stock has seen a decline in the past few months, analysts believe it has more to do with a market correction than with Atlassian's fundamentals. Most SaaS stocks have reported a decline recently, and Atlassian is part of the same industry."
4217230,104556,2018-11-01T16:13:42-04:00,"Atlassian reported great earnings, but they got lost in the tech meltdown.The company is making a push into DevOps with an acquisition and a new offering.All in all, the business is performing well.","Atlassian (TEAM), the software powerhouse from the land down under (Australia that is), has seen its shares take a beating in the latest tech pullback. However, the company's results a couple of weeks ago beat expectations handily.Atlassian is a very solid company that should see strong growth in the years to come due to heavy R&D investments and an expansion of its customer base.The company, for those of you unfamiliar, sells software that helps developers collaborate. Many of its products are sold inexpensively, so purchase decisions can be made right on the spot by coders rather than pushed up the chain of command. For this reason and presumably the ease of use and value-add, Atlassian boasts over 131,000 customers, having added almost 6,000 in the past quarter alone.Some popular products include Confluence, Trello, and of course, Jira. If you're a software person, it's likely you're already familiar with those but just know, these are very popular collaboration tools.The company reported better than expected growth and operating margins, yet investors weren't satisfied. Sales growth came in at 38% to $267.3 million, while operating margins nearly broke even from -12% last year to barely negative this quarter.Moreover, free cash flow stayed strong as usual, at 28% of sales, one of the highest margins in the software space. Granted, half of that is from stock-based compensation but developers have to get fairly compensated after all.Gross margins also saw some expansion from 80% a year ago to 83% now. Management did note that gross margins are expected to compress for the rest of the year as this quarter saw a favorable sales mix.And as always, the company spent magnificently on research and development. It spent 46% of sales on R&D versus only 19% on sales and marketing. For a software company, usually, those proportions are reversed. However, I believe that is the key differentiator for Atlassian. It consistently innovates and creates more consumer surplus, which makes it hard to beat.TEAM R&D to Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe focus of the conference call though was last month's acquisition of OpsGenie for $295 million. This strategic purchase by Atlassian bolsters its new Jira Ops offering, aimed at incident management.Naturally, the analysts on the call were very curious about Atlassian new-found interest in DevOps. Some questions were about how this fits into the competitive landscape with a behemoth like ServiceNow (NOW). Management said it deals with the Fortune 500,000 whereas ServiceNow prioritizes the Fortune 2,000, so there is apparently not much overlap yet. The actual quote by co-CEO, Scott Farquhar is, ""we don't come across them very often.""However, this push into DevOps expands Atlassian's total addressable market greatly. In just North America alone, IT outages cost $700 billion.If you don't know what DevOps is, don't worry. It's kind of confusing. Fortunately, Atlassian has some pretty great literature on it, here and here. It stands for development-operations. It is essentially a methodology to make better software by breaking down the silos between developers and IT operations folks. This takes shape in the form of incident management, automation, and much more.All in all, it seems to be a smart move for Atlassian to start attacking this portion of the market. Most importantly, it fits with the company's vision to help developers collaborate. Now it includes the collaboration between developers and operations. Therefore, it widens the customer base considerably.One more thing to expect in the future, well at least the next quarter, is strong billings growth. Management alluded to the fact that billings would be pulled forward into Q2 because of some price increases that took place a few months back. Not to be short-term-ist, but it is likely the company will beat estimates next quarter.Atlassian, due to its strong growth, impressive free cash flow record, huge market, and great brand awareness, has warranted a premium valuation. The company's latest enterprise value is $16.4 billion after backing out $1.5 billion in cash from its balance sheet. The trailing year's sales come out to $948 million, which results in a high 17x EV/sales ratio. On a forward basis, assuming 35% sales growth, that number comes down to 12.8 but it is still pricey.In terms of free cash flow yield, we get about 1.8%, definitely not a screaming bargain. We can calculate that by taking the last four quarters of free cash flow ($292 million) and dividing it by the enterprise value.Here's how Atlassian stacks up to peers.TEAM EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsJust like any other company, investing in Atlassian carries risks. If ServiceNow decided to come down-market to compete with Jira Ops that would likely stunt its growth.The company is interesting from a risk standpoint because it has so much diversity in terms of customers and products. 131,000 customers mean there is no concentration and the company will not be undercut on price because its products are already so cheap. Therefore, it seems hard to disrupt.However, paying too high a price is always a risk and that argument can be made against Atlassian.Atlassian beat expectations, but its stock has been beaten down. The business is executing well as usual and the new forays into DevOps and Incident Management are exciting. I would recommend taking a starter position if you have yet to. Unless we see a real bear market, don't expect to see TEAM shares too much cheaper.Author's Note: Please scroll up and hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button so you can get these articles before they hit the paywall.

4212695,103480,2018-10-19T08:02:50-04:00,"Shares of Atlassian sunk 7% after reporting Q1 results, despite beating Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom line.Even though revenues beat, investors may have taken issue with the fact that revenue growth decelerated three points sequentially from last quarter's growth.Still, a large jump in operating margins to break-even this quarter (up from -10% in the year-ago quarter) should have quelled any worries.Guidance was no concern either, besting Wall Street's consensus for both Q2 and FY19.Atlassian's problem lies largely in its double-digit revenue valuation, which is especially concerning for a stock that has nearly doubled this year.","Amid a volatile period for technology stocks, Atlassian (TEAM) seems to have finally lost its earnings magic with investors. The company is well known for its reliable pattern of ""beat-and-raise"" earnings quarters, and it didn't fail to achieve this yet again in Q1. Still, however, shares of Atlassian pulled back sharply after announcing results.The recent pullback in the Nasdaq has made one trend clear: the year's winners got punished the most, as investors retreated from high-growth and high-valued stocks and into more defensive, counter-cyclical plays. Atlassian's strong first quarter results have proven to be only an afterthought in the face of the stock's strong performance year-to-date. Good wasn't good enough, and Atlassian shares fell 7% as a result:It's almost useless to compare Atlassian's valuation against peers in the SaaS sector - virtually no other company trades at a forward revenue multiple of 16x revenues, as Atlassian does. As growth stocks shift out of vogue, it's understandable why investors are ditching Atlassian. I, personally, have mixed feelings on the company.To Atlassian's credit, it is one of the strongest fundamental narratives in the SaaS sector. Despite a $1 billion-plus revenue run rate, Atlassian has managed to hold on to its prized growth rate in the ~40% range for a long period of time. Though it has acquired some companies from time to time (for example, spending nearly half a billion on Trello last year), most of this growth has been organic.Atlassian even offered a bullish outlook for the current fiscal year. Take a look at its refreshed guidance for FY19:Figure 1. Atlassian guidanceSource: Atlassian investor relationsThe company's FY19 guidance range of $1.175-$1.183 billion is up $29 million at the midpoint (a 2.5% bump) relative to its prior guidance midpoint of $1.150 billion, and it's also 1.3% higher than Wall Street consensus of $1.163 billion. For a company of this scale, the implied ~35% growth over FY18 revenues certainly is promising.On the product side, Atlassian has continued to expand its technology portfolio while sticking to its core competencies. Most of its offerings are anchored around the flagship Jira platform, to which Atlassian just announced a major upgrade in project tracking. It has zealously defended its reputation as a ""best-in-breed vendor"" with extremely high customer reviews, and this popularity is reflected in its growth rate. Along the way, Atlassian has also capitalized on massive operating efficiencies that have allowed it to realize break-even operating margins while producing generous cash flows.In short, Atlassian looks very close to the implicit promise of a SaaS business model at its end-game stages: it will burn cash upfront as it invests in growth, but once it reaches a premium scale, it can become tremendously profitable. Atlassian has done just that - its guidance implies a 31% FCF margin for the full year. Still, however, its absurdly high revenue valuation is virtually priced for perfection.Growth stocks are prone to running in cycles, and this year's turnover has made many perennially expensive stocks into relative bargains - in this group, I am including Red Hat (RHT), Workday (WDAY), and Facebook (FB). Eventually, Atlassian will fall into this category again, so don't rush to buy it just yet.Here's a look at Atlassian's earnings results for the first quarter:Figure 2. Atlassian 1Q19 resultsSource: Atlassian investor relationsAtlassian grew its revenues by 37% y/y to $267.3 million, thanks in large part to a huge subscription revenue boost of 55% y/y - the most important component of Atlassian's revenues, and the most high-margin. Analysts had only expected total revenues of $259.7 million this quarter, so Atlassian squeaked by with a respectable 3% beat.We have to acknowledge, however, that Atlassian grew revenues at 40% y/y last quarter. Subscription revenues had also grown at 62% y/y then - so the three and seven-point decelerations in total and subscription revenue growth, respectively, could have thrown investors off. Atlassian is only guiding to 35% y/y growth for FY19, so it still has some breathing room to decelerate in the back half of the year - but for a company that has been growing in excess of 40% for so long, the drop in growth rates could be startling.Customer counts ended the quarter at 131.7k, with 5.9k net new additions in the quarter. Again, this is down from last quarter, in which Atlassian added 6.6k net new customers. Obviously, Atlassian is still growing, but it's becoming a victim of its own scale as it slows down.All of the good news this quarter, in my view, is on the profitability side. Atlassian continued to work wonders on its margin expansion, with gross margins expanding to a sky-high 83.1%, a 360bps expansion over 79.5% margins in the year-ago quarter. Atlassian already had among the highest gross margin profiles in the SaaS sector, which somewhat validates its high valuation multiple. See how that stacks up against other popular SaaS plays:This gross margin growth also translated well into operating margins. Recall that unlike most of its peers in the SaaS industry, Atlassian doesn't invest in heavy-touch sales teams, instead focusing on marketing through developer channels. Still, Atlassian has managed to slim down its sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues even further, down to 19.6% this quarter versus 29.0% in the year-ago quarter.The significance of this can't be overstated: Most SaaS companies spend a large portion of their revenues (for some startups, between half to 100% of revenues); yet Atlassian has managed tremendous top line growth without pumping too much into sales.As a result, IFRS operating margins hit break-even this quarter, a 10-point improvement relative to -10.4% in the year-ago quarter. Pro forma EPS of $0.20 edged out over Wall Street consensus of $0.19, and operating cash flows grew 30% y/y to $84.9 million. After netting out $10.7 million of capex, Atlassian generated $74.2 million in free cash flow, representing a robust 28% FCF margin:Figure 3. Atlassian cash flowsSource: Atlassian investor relationsWhile I remain fundamentally bullish on Atlassian for the long term, it's impossible to deny that Atlassian shares have become prohibitively expensive and long overdue for a pullback. Its all-time high, reached in late September, was $98, so Atlassian is now down about 20% from all-time highs. While that sounds overblown, note that many other SaaS favorites like Dropbox (DBX) and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) are down between 30-40% from all-time highs.With a valuation as rich as Atlassian's, it has plenty further to fall. I'd consider the stock a buy at $65, a price target that represents an EV/FTM revenue multiple of 12.0x and ~35% down from all-time highs. Stay on the sidelines until then."

Follow this account and turn on the e-mail alert to receive VCDeals in your inbox on Saturday mornings.Did we miss a notable deal? Let us know in the comments.  WeWork gets $1B: WeWork (VWORK) secured a $1B investment from SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBF, OTCPK:SFTBY). The disclosure happened in the co-working company’s first financial presentation, which happened due to the spring bond sale. The company remains in talks with other potential investors for an additional $1B with a $42B valuation float. WeWork continues to march towards a 2019 IPO.  WeWork’s 1H18 losses tripled Y/Y to $723M with revenue run rate of $1.8B (up from $1.5B at end of Q1). SoftBank’s latest investment, structured as a convertible note,  brought the existing cash pile and commitments up to $4B. The company plans to use the funds for overseas expansion, building office space, and acquiring new properties and leaseholds.   Uber trucking competitor: Chinese truck-hailing platform Manbang Group is seeking $1B in new funding, according to WSJ sources. Previous backers include SoftBank and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) with Manbang currently approaching U.S.-based mutual funds and late-stage investors. The new cash would push Manbang to a $10B valuation.  Manbang Group’s mobile app matches merchants to truckers to transport cargo and also offers stored-value toll cards, diesel cards, and member financing. As of June, about 3.1M truckers logged into the app at least once a month, up 36% on the year. The company will use the new funds to expand in China. Sources suggest Manbang is also building up cash for some domestic acquisitions perhaps in the field of autonomous trucking.  Competition: Uber Freight, which is undergoing a structural overhaul as Uber doubles its investments in the unit.  EBay competitor: Naspers (NPSND, OTCPK:NPSNY) provided $500M in funding for used goods app marketplace LetGo. Valuation was sitting at around $1.5B before the newest infusion. Previous backers have included Accel, Insight Venture Partners, and Eight Roads Ventures.  LetGo says the app has passed 100M downloads and 400M listings in total with monthly listers up 65% YTD. Message metrics include 13M messages sent daily and 6B total since the opening three years ago. The business is primarily based in the U.S. and Spain (through a merger with local startup Wallapop).  Competition: EBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Craigslist, and OfferUp, to name a few.  Increased Slack: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams competitor Slack is reportedly raising at least $400M on a $7B+ valuation. TechCrunch sources say General Atlantic is leading the round with Dragoneer among the backers.  Slack recently passed 8M daily active users with 3M paying subscribers. The company has 70K paid enterprise teams including Capital One, IBM, and eBay and 65% of the Fortune 100. Slack recently bought and closed competitor HipChat from Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) in exchange for a Slack stake.  Competition: Microsoft, which reported 200K paying Teams organizations earlier this year, recently launched a free tier to take on Slack and Facebook launched Workplace.  Travel experience platform: TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) and Airbnb (AIRB) competitor Klook raised $200M from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Boyu Capital, TCV, Sequoia China, Matrix Partners, and OurCrowd. Total fundraising now totals $296.5M. Klook declined to provide its valuation.  Hong Kong-based Klook will use the funding to move into the U.S. and European markets. The company’s platform sells travel experiences and attraction tickets and Klook says it’s on track for $1B in bookings this year. Klook is available across Asia with Greater China serving as the largest market. Klook plans to open its first U.S. office by the end of the year.  DDR cancer treatment: Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) Ventures, Novartis (NYSE:NVS) Venture Fund, and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Ventures participated in a $84M Series B round in Artios Pharma, developer of DNA Damage Response treatments for cancer. Andera Partners and Life Sciences Partners led the round with participation from Arix Bioscience, SV Health Investors, M Ventures, and IP Group. The round brought total funding up to about $115M.  Artios treatments target tumors where DNA damage response factors have been lost or down regulated, which can selectively kill cancer cells without harming normal cells. The treatments can also potentially work well in combination therapies with existing treatments. You can find the current Artios pipeline here.  Competition: Sierra Oncology (NASDAQ:SRRA) is also working on DDR cancer therapies.  CNS gene therapy: Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRPT) made a $30M equity investment in gene therapy company Lacerta, which was spun out from the University of Florida. The investment gave Sarepta exclusive rights to central nervous system-targeted gene therapy for the metabolic disorder Pompe Disease and two unnamed programs for other rare CNS disease. Sarepta will take over once clinical testing starts in the programs.  Sarepta committed to paying Lacerta development and sales-based milestones plus single-digit royalties on net sales. Lacerta gained access to Sarepta’s talent, dosing and delivery platform, capsid screening library, and manufacturing technology. Sarepta got to add three gene therapies to the existing eight programs. Competition: Avrobio (NASDAQ:AVRO) and Audentes Therapeutics (NASDAQ:BOLD) are among the companies working on gene therapies for Pompe Disease.

The company's main products are:The company started with the first two and added others (the list is by no means complete). So this is another Swiss army knife type of SaaS business platform company with multiple revenue streams and opportunities to increase these.In fact, some of its products are so useful that they expand their own purported domain for which they were intended, like Jira Service Desk. Here is management during the Q4CC:The progress comes from a disciplined approach and a philosophy that is working very well. The company is completely focused on customer satisfaction and seamless delivery, and high R&D.The high R&D especially is what provides the company with new capabilities and solutions, generating new revenue streams, as the proliferating amount of product testifies.Another part comes from smart acquisitions, like those of Statuspage or Trello, which are really doing well within the platform, according to management.The company is actually spoiled for choice. They have so many ways to invest R&D dollars that they have to make choices.There are two noteworthy changes here:The bounty in R&D opportunities led management to decide that their own communications solutions (Stride and HipChat, as well as HipChat Server and Data Center) will be discontinued (at roughly a $1M net loss of revenue).The company will integrate with the communications platform of Slack, which will also acquire the intellectual property of Stride and HipChat.The company even made a (small, undisclosed) equity investment in Slack and the companies will work together to deepen existing product integration (Jira Cloud, Trello, Bitbucket Cloud and Slack) and develop new ones.Management argued that in terms of returns on R&D dollars, they see better opportunities outside the real-time communications space. While we can't corroborate that, from a logical point of view it makes sense.Management is going to focus more on the needs of the IT market, as IT is becoming more service-driven and agile-oriented and the company had great success with Jira Service Desk in this segment.But management sees plenty of opportunities here, as they see how customers are using their products and the customer focus absorbs their needs. Management on the Q4CC:Testifying to their R&D bounty, the company has launched Atlassian Access, which solves the conflicting demands of having easy access to systems while also keeping them safe. From the Q4 Shareholder letter:They also keep adding functionality and improvements to existing products, like:The company just produced had another phenomenal quarter. From the company's earnings deck:Other revenue consists of training fees and fees from their thriving marketplace of third party solutions (more than 4000 free and paid apps generating more than $200M in purchases in fiscal 2018).From the Q4 Shareholder letter:So revenue increased 40% y/y, a beat by some 4% with EPS ($0.13) being a penny higher than expected.From the earnings deck:When the move to AWS cloud will be complete management argues that gross margins will decline just a tad.There isn't really much of a trend in neither gross nor operating margins in either their IFRS or non-IFRS variant (below):TEAM Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThat is, there is little in the way of operating leverage, which we consider a bit of a blight, given the stock valuation.The company spends a tremendous amount on R&D, 37.2% of revenues in Q4 or $90.8M (non-IFRS). We applaud that, and the results are there for everybody to see.TEAM Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe above is of course a really nice graph and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue is rather high (26.4% in Q4), but it isn't really trending (which would be surprising, given the lack of operational leverage). From the earnings deck:TEAM Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsMore than half of the free cash flow comes from stock-based compensation, and what is a little surprising is that there is a fair amount of dilution going on. Despite the free cash flow, the company isn't buying back any shares, at least not yet.From the Q4 Shareholder letter:So there is some more dilution (8.74M shares or 3.8%) on the way, even if in the greater scheme of things, this isn't all that much.From the Q4 Shareholder letter:You see a unusually large gap between IFRS and non-IFRS figures, for instance 2019 EPS is guided at a loss of $0.30 (IFRS) or a profit of $0.77 (non-IFRS). Here is the difference, from the Q4 Shareholder letter:Most of it ($0.94) is caused by share-based compensation; no surprise there. The 2019 guided figures are somewhat inflated by the adoption of a new accounting rule, IFRS 15. From the Q4 Shareholder letter:We started writing this when the shares were closing in on $80, which seemed a bit over the top to us.How things can change in just a few trading days is pretty amazing, but nevertheless, the shares are still very steeply valued:TEAM EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsThe company does basically everything perfect, which is why the shares are also priced for perfection. We do have some gripes with the level of stock-based compensation and the related dilution, and the lack of operating leverage.But basically, these are related to their huge R&D spending, and as long as they keep doing that and produce new applications that open up new revenue streams, cement the platform by making it more valuable and sticky, and you don't hear us complain.Management has other smart ways to add to the production of their R&D department, like smart acquisitions, strategic partnerships like those with Slack, and their third party app market.All this is fed by a relentless customer focus that gets the whole company attuned to the needs of customers. It's all very impressive.We can't fully recommend buying the shares at these elevated prices though. Despite a 10% drop from the heights in just two days, they are still terribly expensive.While time is on the side of the shareholder, as the company will grow into this valuation, in the meantime, sentiment towards technology shares (or market sentiment as a whole) can shift, or the company could produce a disappointing quarter.Even a slightly disappointing quarter might lead to a considerable sell-off. The company is simply priced for perfection. That's what we got so far; can they keep it up?"
4205422,101421,2018-09-10T19:41:45-04:00,Atlassian said it would acquire OpsGenie for $295 million in total consideration.OpsGenie provides IT DevOps teams with advanced system outage planning and response technologies.TEAM is acquiring OpsGenie to build out its offerings to the IT downtime response market it views as costing North American firms $700 billion annually.,"Atlassian (TEAM) announced it has аgreed to acquire OpsGenie for $295 million.OpsGenie operates a modern incident management platform to assist DevOps teams in more efficiently managing and responding to planned and unplanned service disruptions.TEAM is making a strategic acquisition to broaden its offerings to IT departments overwhelmed by system outages and downtime.I’m very positive on the acquisition which should have little integration risk and will provide another significant touch point for Atlassian’s selling efforts.Boston, Massachusetts,-based OpsGenie was founded in 2012 to develop and operate a cloud-based DevOps management platform.The service enables operations teams to manage service disruption alerts generated by monitoring tools to ensure the right people are notified, and the problems are addressed in a timely manner.Management is headed by Co-Founder and CEO Berkay Mollamustafaoglu, who was previously CTO at iFountain.Below is an overview video of OpsGenie:(Source: OpsGenie)OpsGenie’s primary offerings feature:Company partners or integrations include:Battery Ventures is listed as the sole institutional investor in OpsGenie, having invested $10 million in disclosed funding. (Source: CrunchBase) This is unusual for a venture-backed company, which typically would have a syndicate of investors.According to a 2018 market research report by Markets and Markets, the global incident management market is projected to grow from $13.4 billion in 2018 to $33.8 billion by 2023.This represents a very strong CAGR of 20.3% between 2018 and 2023.The main drivers for this expected growth are the heavy financial losses post incident occurrence, a rise in security breaches targeting enterprises, and need to adhere to compliance requirements.North America is projected to hold the largest share of incident management spend due to advanced technology and infrastructure adoption.Major competitive vendors that provide incident management platforms include:Atlassian disclosed the acquisition price and terms as $295 million, comprised of $259 million in cash and the remainder in Atlassian restricted shares, subject to continued vesting provisions.TEAM didn’t file a 6-K but said the deal will ""add approximately one percentage point of revenue to the target revenue range of $1,146 to $1,154 million"" to TEAM’s FYE 2019, which ends June 30, 2019.Given the deal is expected to close in October, this comes out to OpsGenie producing approximately $11.5 million in revenues for nine months of the new fiscal year, or an annual revenue run rate of about $15 million.If I have that right, then Atlassian is paying a forward revenue multiple of $295 million divided by $15 million, or about 19.7x. If correct, that's quite a healthy price and indicative of how much Atlassian wants OpsGenie’s technologies.TEAM said the deal will be dilutive to IFRS operating margin in FYE 2019.A review of the firm’s most recent annual filing indicates that Atlassian had $1.7 million in cash and short-term investments and total liabilities of $1.5 billion.Free cash flow during the 12 months ended June 30, 2018, was $281.2 million.Atlassian is acquiring OpsGenie for access to a major market: IT downtime. Management cites an IHS Markit report that says downtime costs North American enterprises $700 billion per year.As Scott Farquhar, Atlassian’s co-CEO stated in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, TEAM’s stock price has risen 144% vs. the S&P 500 Index 13%, as the chart below indicates:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Atlassian's stock has been on a veritable rocket ride in the past year but analysts have continued to warn of overvaluation.Management continues to execute and deliver results that investors want, with its most recent earnings beating estimates slightly on several major metrics.The deal for OpsGenie, while not cheap, gives TEAM a credible platform addition to move more forcefully into the DevOps space. With OpsGenie’s alerting and processing functionalities, the addition to Atlassian’s suite of offerings of these capabilities should be compelling to clients and prospects.Integration risk should be minimal, as the two companies already worked together through OpsGenie’s integration with Atlassian’s Jira product.I’m bullish on the long-term value of this deal.

4213586,98236,2018-10-23T17:30:40-04:00,"Atlassian announced the results of its fiscal Q1 last Thursday.Once again, the results the company announced beat prior consensus estimates in terms of revenues, earnings, and cash flow.Once again, the company guided expectations above the prior consensus for revenues, earnings, and free cash flow.The company detailed some plans for it to extend its footprint in the IT operations space both with the acquisition of of OpsGenie and the release of JiraOps.The company also announced a rather substantial product update for Jira Cloud that is likely to have some product cycle impact on growth the balance of this year.","According to traditional history books, when the British army surrendered to Washington and Lafayette at Yorktown, the band played a British tune first published in the 1640s called the “World Turned upside Down.” It was on October 19, 1781 - almost 240 years ago. The World Turned Upside Down is actually a cheerful ballad, and I suppose playing it was entirely appropriate at Yorktown, where the British and a significant cohort of loyalist allies were out-thought and out-fought by the Americans and the French.The tune might have been played last Friday, appropriately, as high-tech, high-growth shares, including those of Atlassian (TEAM) in particular, were turned upside down in a major way. I think that at this point, investors are looking at Atlassian shares in an upside-down fashion. This is a high-growth, high-margin business, expanding into new areas and exploiting its technology optimally. It has an EV/S ratio of 13X, high no doubt if considered in isolation. But the company has developed a very long growth runway for itself, and it is the leader in collaboration software used by work groups, both within and outside of the IT space at this time. And it generates a substantial level of free cash flow, with free cash flow margins expected to reach 32% this year.And while it is always difficult to rate these kinds of things, it is apparent to many industry observers that the leadership of this company is amongst “the best and the brightest” in the enterprise software space. It is, I suppose, hard to quantify that part of a valuation model - but the people who have built this company over the past 16 years, despite some of their political thinking, have shown they are extremely skilled in identifying trends in the IT space and in capitalizing on opportunities. And the ability of the two founders to continue their collaboration is one of those major positives for this company that it is impossible to quantify. The recent sale of Atlassian’s HipChat service to Slack (SLACK) was a great way to reorient the company. The more recent purchase of OpsGenie continues to add to the company's focus in some potentially explosive new spaces.Is this the optimal price at which to enter these shares? The shares are volatile, and perhaps they are less well known by investors than other $1 billion revenue software companies. More than 96% of the shares are owned by institutions and the shares are only covered by 15 analysts. But after declining by 25% in three weeks, I think the entry point is attractive.Over the past several weeks, the higher growth, higher valued software stocks, that had performed well through about the first half of 2018, dramatically reversed course. Even the IGV software index, which is essentially flat since the start of August, and down a bit over 10% since its peak at the start of October, really provides a poor representation of the severity in percentage terms of the drop in what had been the fastest appreciating names. The world indeed has apparently turned upside down.I don’t purport to give economic forecasts or advice about the trend of equity valuations per se. In fact, I am often appalled by what I might term the casual profundity with which forecasts of such gravity are provided without use of the latest forecasting tools. There is no tool I have yet seen which calculates with much better than random chance the “right” valuation for a particular growth rate or can provide economists with precise, tested correlations on which to base an economic forecast. If anyone is seeking proof of that particular assertion - look no further than Friday’s report on housing sales - 3 interest rate increases and the housing market has apparently stalled.So, this is not an article about valuations or the economy or climbing walls of worry or anything like that. I wouldn’t really be able add to the conversation by suggesting that there is a specific EV/S that one ought to pay for a particular growth rate or a particular company. I am willing to recommend to readers that paying 13X EV/S for Atlassian shares is both prudent and likely to lead to favorable financial outcome. But I might argue that paying 13X EV/S, even for a company with what appears to have a comparable growth rate to TEAM would not be reasonable or prudent.My goal in this article is to discuss some of the operating trends that Atlassian (TEAM) reported late last week. I am not going to claim prescience or second sight on the fraught issues of valuation for this company. I doubt seriously that the investors/traders who sold Atlassian shares so forcefully in the wake of the latest earnings release were really fixated on the EV/S ratio. And I doubt that there really were many shareholders who felt disappointed in much, if anything, Atlassian either reported or had to say about the state of their business or its outlook.I have recently been asked on several occasions, ""what am I missing"" in terms of why Atlassian or other high-growth names have fallen so far so fast. My own contention, based on some experience going back awhile, is that Atlassian, along with a host of other names, is seeing its shares down valued as part of a very strong risk-off trade implemented by quant investors. Quant funds deliberately eschew knowing anything whatsoever about specifics of valuation or market share or free cash flow. That simply isn’t how they have or will operate. The answer to the question of ""what am I missing"" is probably nothing particular when it comes to an analysis of the business. The missing piece is simply that in a given time period, the price of Atlassian shares can be controlled by investors who are absolutely disinterested in the fundamentals of the company's business.That may not be terribly satisfying to some readers - but with 60%-70% or more of the volume in listed securities being traded by quant funds, who use very similar algorithms and use many of the same correlations, it is a more feasible explanation than torturing some explanation for a falling growth rate for Atlassian as the reason for the rather substantial share price decline.Atlassian, today, is not what Atlassian was a couple of years ago. That may not be totally noticeable to many since the company still sells its main product Jira to the same kind of users. It has become a bit more ubiquitous and a bit more expensive, but it is certainly still the major revenue driver for the company.But there is quite a bit of Atlassian beyond Jira, and it seems probable that in the future, more revenue will come from newer areas of the company. The company in early 2017 acquired Trello and has since shed HipChat in a transaction with Slack. Atlassian has made a career of acquisition, and Trello was the 18th transaction and largest the company has closed. Trello, for those not familiar with the company, was a spin-off from Fog Creek Software. It offers a service that enables an automated form of project management using what looks like a series of pinboards. Trello, at least at the 30,000 ft. level, appears to be addressing a similar market to Jira, but it is doing so in a fashion that is easier for non-software developers to use. While Trello seems to be very successful, much of its success will come from drag-along revenues and in solidifying Atlassian’s position in the collaboration space.Trello is still a small part of Atlassian’s revenue - certainly less than 5% in the prior fiscal year. That said, user growth and other revenue statistics are showing growth of 50% or more for the Trello solution, above the company’s forecast when it acquired the company and that seems likely to continue. Just how much Trello drags along other Atlassian revenues is harder to say - at the moment, Atlassian is focusing on the land part of the Trello strategy.In early September, Atlassian announced that it was spending almost $300 million to buy OpsGenie. Part of the reason to invest in Atlassian is that it has and is likely to continue to make strategic acquisitions that substantially expand its TAM and support its growth rate far beyond the numbers that are published these days.I think that a comment made by co-CEO at the time of the acquisition to the effect that, “One of the reasons we withdrew from the communications market (the sale of HipChat) is we see a much, much, much bigger prize for us in IT.” Overall, IT operations software is supposed to be a $20 billion market by 2022. OpsGenie is part of what the company now calls JiraOps which also include Jira Help Desk and Service Desk offerings.This new acquisition, coupled with the announcement of JiraOps as another component of a Atlassian IT ops solution conjunction with Jira Help Desk/Service Desk, is obviously intended to extend the company’s footprint in order to more effectively compete for enterprise class users in the market so long dominated by ServiceNow (NOW). During the conference call Thursday evening, the Atlassian CFO said it did not yet see ServiceNow in many competitive situations, but I think over time, that is likely to change, given the goals of both companies.Becoming a major competitor of NOW is a non-trivial undertaking. But inevitably, NOW and TEAM will butt heads as the Jira products in question become more targeted to larger enterprises. I can’t really assure readers that I have some proof point as to how the competition is going to go. I am not sure with a market measured in the tens of billions in potential and a company the size of Atlassian, I have to prove they will beat NOW in order to recommend the shares.But one factor that might be of interest to readers is that Jira Service Desk is 1/5th the price of NOW’s comparable offering. I have provided a link to a 3rd party evaluation comparing Jira to ServiceNow. The acquisition of OpsGenie further extends the competition. Atlassian spends far less of its revenues on sales and marketing when compared to NOW - the reason it is so profitable. It can do that because its products provide users with a very high cost/benefit ratio which in turn engenders a significant level of word of mouth marketing.This is part of the reason why the company should be able to maintain a much higher growth rate into the future, particularly when compared to the 26.5% revenue growth projected by the First Call consensus for fiscal 2020. My belief is the combination or organic and inorganic sources will keep TEAM growing in the low to mid 30% range and that operating margins will continue to advance modestly as well.Atlassian is a far more profitable company and generates far more free cash than most of its high-growth peers. Its valuation anomaly, in terms of EV/S, is really not so surprising when the level of free cash flow growth and free cash flow margins take the place of the ever popular enterprise value/sales ratio as the main components of a valuation analysis. It would actually be surprising if Atlassian shares did not have amongst the highest EV/S ratios in the software world - because Atlassian would appear to have the highest free cash flow margin of peer hyper-growth IT companies.I suppose the answer has to be two-fold. On the one hand, Atlassian shares declined by more than 14% last Friday, so that surely means some investors might have been disappointed. But I think that the share price move really was a not a function of investor disappointment with either the results or the guidance that Atlassian provided. The fact is that just about across the board, the operating results in Q1 were better than investors and analysts had projected, and the company provided what I would consider to be strong guidance. From an operational perspective, Atlassian continues to show its ability to drive growth - and of some note - profitability and cash flow. Many investment management tomes talk about free cash flow as the lodestar of valuation - and indeed discounted free cash flow is supposed to be the metric most used to derive share price valuations. Atlassian is already achieving free cash flow margins of 28%, and it is forecasting free cash flow margins for this year to reach 32%.Given the level of both growth and profitability Atlassian has been able to achieve, it would be difficult to deny that the company was one of the better run businesses in the software space. And, the company actually guided above its own prior forecast for both revenues, profits and free cash flow. While the space in which the company operates is a bit amorphous and difficult to define with precision, it seems likely to me that the company is increasing dominance in the market areas in which it competes.Just to recapitulate the headline metrics, total revenues rose by 37% which compared to prior guidance for 33% growth. The company over-attained its prior forecast for non-IFRS earnings by about $.01. It raised guidance for Q2 - with revenue growth now forecast to be about 3% above the prior consensus. The new EPS forecast of for the quarter is $.01 above the prior consensus. Atlassian has a long history of over-attaining its guidance. I would be surprised if that process didn’t continue through the course of fiscal 2019.Perhaps one percentage point of the guidance increase is related to the company’s purchase of OpsGenie; the OpsGenie purchase probably is a factor in the smaller increase in EPS guidance. Overall, the company added about 6,000 new customers in the quarter, which raised its customer count to 131,000. That cadence is consistent with customer growth over the past several quarters.I was most impressed by the rather noticeable increase in the company’s gross margins. While operating expenses are levers that companies can and do control based on specific goals they may have, the ability companies have to improve gross margins is a sign of a health of their marketplace. Software companies, it goes without saying, do not sell anything tangible, and it's their pricing more than any other factor that drives their gross margins. Gross margins actually rose by about 400 bps to over 83% on an IFRS basis. And they did so while the company continued to transition to a subscription revenue model. Subscription revenues rose by 55% last quarter, while maintenance and perpetual license revenues only rose by 21% and 12%, respectively.In the interest of completeness, I want to note that the CFO, during the conference call, suggested that gross margins were quite high on a relative basis this past quarter as the company leverages its use of AWS (AMZN) infrastructure to support its base of subscription customers.The company’s calculated booking metric rose by 33% year on year. There is a story there in that last year deferred revenue growth was driven by some users signing annual renewals early to escape a price increase. This year, the price increase took place a couple of weeks later in the quarter, and the impact of early renewals was less. Overall, deferred revenue increases mean less to a company that is still selling lots of smaller deals to workgroups as well as enterprise agreements.And yet the shares came close to imploding in the wake of the earnings release and lost 14% of their value on Friday in the wake of the earnings report. And so far as it goes, the shares were certainly not over-performing in the last 6 weeks or so in anticipation of earnings - they had lost 16% of their value in the last 3 weeks before Friday’s debacle.There have been some commentators on this site and in other locations who have suggested that this kind of share price performance is to be expected - either because of the valuation of Atlassian shares or because the shares, even at their current level are still up 33% year to date or by 40% over the past year. Needless to say, I do not agree. Atlassian shares do have a rather elevated EV/S ratio - particularly when compared to other vendors who are either growing more slowly in terms of revenues, or who are not profitable or who do not enjoy rather substantial free cash flow margins.I think the error on the part of many commentators who talk about elevated valuations relates to their inability or unwillingness to evaluate a company’s strategy and its competitive moat in some kind of systematic fashion. Investors generally try to evaluate the ability of management to drive competitive advantages over the long term. Investing in stocks is not the same as trying cases in a court of law. There is no such thing as a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. I can’t prove that Atlassian shares, with a current EV/S based on my growth assumptions for the next 4 quarters is now 13X are really a buy. I think that they are, simply because I think that investors will value the company’s substantial level of free cash flow and the moat that sustains that cash flow, and because investors can expect growth in the low to mid 30% range for at least the next 3 years, and perhaps longer.Atlassian is projecting that it will achieve operating margins of about 20% on a non-IFRS basis this year. This would be up by 100 bps year on year. Operating margins have shown a consistent upward trend for several years now, and forecasts for that metric have been most often exceeded. Why is the company able to produce decent profits and strong operating cash flow margins?My belief is that Atlassian and its Jira product have a certain cachet as the collaboration tool of choice. This has allowed the company to raise prices, and in turn, this has led to a strong pattern of operating margin growth. There is surely not a 100% correlation between development spend and user satisfaction. Sometimes, perhaps often, companies make poor choices in terms of their development projects.But one advantage this company has is the background of its leadership and their experience in building this company. It perhaps means something that both of the co-presidents are adjunct professors at the University of NSW in Computer Science. I suspect that is a rare combination in the ranks of senior executives in the IT space.In any event, even at this scale, Atlassian spends 46% of its revenues on research and development. That is actually down a little from the 48% spend ratio the company reported for Q1 of the prior fiscal year. What it means, at least to this writer, is that the company is willing to outspend its rivals on product development by a substantial amount.The company continues to update its offerings and probably is doing so at a noticeably greater rate than competitors. Most recently, the company launched a new incarnation of Jira which some believe will further accelerate growth of that platform.I can’t prove that there is a direct correlation between research and development spend and user satisfaction and word of mouth recommendation. Is Jira really better than its competitors. I have linked here to a Jira commercial. No doubt there will be readers of this article who will disagree with the commercial, which is why there are so many competitors in the market. But if user satisfaction can be measured in some practical way, it would appear to be the ability that Atlassian has had to raise prices and to achieve strong gross margins is probably correlated with overall user satisfaction.And this user satisfaction strategy has seemingly worked out in that the sales and marketing spend ratio fell to only 19% on an IFRS basis last quarter, down from about 23% in the prior year. While again, there is nothing provable in looking at spend metrics and product quality that can be proven, it is worth noting that there are very few, if any, high growth software companies that have such a low sales and marketing spend ratio.My thesis, simply put, is that Atlassian can charge more for its products because they offer users a very high ratio of benefits to costs. The company spends an incredible amount on research and development. It has the confidence to do so because of the background and work experience of its leadership. This enables the company to offer users new products and more features compared to the competition. Because user satisfaction is high, the company doesn’t need to spend huge sums that characterize many other software vendors on sales and marketing. And the overall result of this strategy has been the ability Atlassian has had to achieve high and rising margins. It is, I believe, a principal part of the case to be made for the company’s valuation and for the ownership of its shares.Atlassian is gradually leveraging its general and administrative costs. Last quarter, these costs fell to 17% of revenues, down from 18% in the year earlier period. The company has been seeing progress in terms of trimming the general and administrative cost ratio for some time now, and while acquisitions may impact quarterly metrics in this area, I expect to see continuing spend discipline to further improve general and administrative spend ratios.In turn, the high level of profitability has enabled this company to report substantial levels of free cash flow, the metric this company focuses on in evaluating its profitability. Last year, free cash flow growth was more than 50%. Operating cash flow growth was 30% last quarter, although free cash flow growth was lower due to purchase of property and equipment as part of the company’s continued geographic expansion (new headquarters in new countries). The company is forecasting that it will achieve free cash flow growth of 32% this year. This past quarter, almost all of the growth in cash flow was because of higher levels of profitability. Indeed, as mentioned earlier in this article, Atlassian actually battled exogenous headwinds in terms of cash flow because it had a lower level of “pull forwards”, and it reported numbers on a changed accounting standard called IFRS 15.Atlassian is thought by some to be a company with an elevated level of EV/S. That really ignores its high level of profitability and free cash flow margin. The company is demonstrating that it is a leading vendor in its space, and it has clearly made some pivots that will expand its TAM. It is led by some of the thought leaders in the IT space. Perhaps one of the principal risks in owning these shares are the potential political aspirations of its leaders which have seen some publicity in recent months through Tweets. And the company is an IT vendor, and IT spending, at least at some level, is correlated to global growth. There is really not enough history for anyone to know just how cyclically sensitive the creation of work groups or help desks might be if global growth decelerates.But overall, this was another in a string of strong quarters for Atlassian, and I like the new directions and journeys on which the company has embarked. I think that the company will achieve positive alpha over the next 12 months and feel that the current level of share price retracement affords investors with a decent entry point."
4191248,103480,2018-07-27T13:37:44-04:00,"Atlassian, the software developer behind a suite of enterprise collaboration tools, has rocketed to all-time highs on the back of Q4 results.The company posted strong beats to analyst expectations for Q4 and also offered upside guidance for the coming year.It also announced the sale of HipChat to Slack for an undisclosed sum.While Atlassian's results and growth trajectory look solid, shares look prohibitively expensive at ~14x forward revenues.","It seems to be impossible to stop Atlassian (TEAM), the maker of enterprise collaboration and workflow software. The stock is one that has repeatedly defied valuation, and after popping more than 10% on the back of its Q4 earnings report, the company has vaulted to new all-time highs that also make it one of the most expensive stocks in the software sector. Over the past year, shares of Atlassian have doubled; in the year to date alone, the stock has rallied more than 65%.TEAM data by YChartsI've been bullish on Atlassian in the past, getting into the stock late last year when it was trading in the low $40s (about half of where it's trading today). And while I'll acknowledge that I sold too soon when I became skittish on the valuation, there's simply much less reason now to hold onto Atlassian when it has notched a record-breaking valuation. Atlassian has a great product and a great story, as well as a penchant for always posting sequential ""beat and raise"" quarters that have made it an investor favorite - but when it's trading this richly, the only way to go is down.This quarter, we've seen a lot of high-flying fan favorites bite the dust - from Netflix (NFLX) to Facebook (FB), and last quarter in the software sector, Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT). Nothing is invincible, particularly if they've been riding substantially higher in the past couple of months and are notching a high valuation. Though Atlassian doesn't seem to be showing any signs of deceleration yet, there's no guarantee that it won't do so, either.One of the other reasons that investors are cheering Atlassian post-Q4 is due to its sale of HipChat ad Stride to Slack. Both were enterprise chat tools that were one of Atlassian's lesser offerings, and it's being sold to Slack for an undisclosed amount. Here's what Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian's co-founder and co-CEO, said on the earnings call:But even if these offerings were non-critical, the elimination of these products from the portfolio is sure to eliminate at least a portion of Atlassian's revenues. Though Atlassian probably got a fantastic price for the sale, investors might not be fully prepared for the revenue deceleration that comes attached with it. Slack has been growing revenues at a ~40% clip over the past few quarters; eliminating a product could send revenue growth to the mid-30s as early as next quarter.Here's a look as well at where Atlassian stands in terms of valuation against its peers in large-cap software:TEAM EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsOne opportunity for Atlassian to distinguish its valuation against peers is on the free cash flow side. Atlassian has massively improved its free cash flow over the past several years, and in the coming year, it has guided to $350-360 million in FCF, or 26% y/y growth relative to this year's FCF of $282.2 million (Atlassian also guided to $1.145-1.155 billion in revenues, implying 32% y/y revenue growth and beating analyst expectations of $1.11 billion or 27% y/y growth). At the company's current enterprise value of $17.1 billion, it currently trades at a 48x forward FCF multiple. While that's still an elevated valuation, the fact that Atlassian keeps crushing results on the free cash flow growth side might justify a multiple in the mid-30s, much more so than a 13-14x revenue valuation.Overall, Atlassian is a great company, but buying a stock that's at the top of the valuation stack relative to peers is an extremely dangerous proposition. While I remain fundamentally bullish on Atlassian and its prospects, I'm more inclined to stay on the sidelines until a better price avails itself.Here's a look at Atlassian's Q4 results:Figure 1. Atlassian Q4 resultsSource: Atlassian investor relationsTotal revenues grew 40% y/y to $243.8 million, muscling well past Wall Street's expectations for $233.4 million (+34% y/y). Big beats like this are customary for Atlassian, however, and the company has maintained the ~40% growth pace that it began to set in the first quarter. The year before that, Atlassian was only growing in the mid-30s.One of the major drivers for this growth - especially behind the 62% y/y growth in subscription revenues, Atlassian's most critical and highest-margin source of revenues - is product diversity. Like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Atlassian has a fairly wide-ranging portfolio of offerings, from the flagship Jira workflow tool to service desk offerings, to the document collaboration platform Confluence and coding platform Bitbucket. Up until recently, this product mix also included enterprise chat. As noted above, the removal of enterprise chat may mark a wind-down of Atlassian's revenue growth. Guidance for FY19 calls for 32% y/y revenue growth - unlike in FY18, Atlassian's results in FY19 might come in a lot closer to the expected guidance rather than showing the generous beats that it has in this year.For the moment, however, Atlassian looks to be firing on all cylinders. The company added ~6.6k net new customers in the quarter to end the active customer base at 125.8k customers, and the Atlassian Marketplace, which is essentially an app store for third-party Atlassian plug-ins and tools, hit ""over $200 million"" in revenues for FY18 with a cumulative lifetime total in excess of $600 million.Atlassian also hugely reduced its operating losses in the fourth quarter to just -$5.3 million, an operating loss margin of just -2%, versus -$32.3 million and -18% in the year-ago quarter. Particularly driving this improvement was an increase in sales leverage, as the company spent just 20% of its revenues on sales and marketing (a much lower percentage than the typical direct-sales SaaS company) versus 26% of revenues in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin also saw a three-point leap from an already-high 79% in 4Q17 to 82% in the current quarter.Despite these margin advances and the huge beat to top-line estimates, Atlassian's pro forma EPS of $0.13 only beat Wall Street consensus of $0.12 by a penny. Free cash flow, however, showed massive 45% y/y leap in the quarter to $64.4 million, capping off a strong year of 53% y/y free cash flow growth in FY18. Should this trend hold, there's plenty of opportunity for Atlassian to achieve greater than the $350-360 million of free cash flow guidance that the company gave for FY19.Figure 2. Atlassian cash flowsSource: Atlassian investor relationsThere's no doubt that Atlassian is a terrific company that is showing no signs of slowing down - however, ceding one of its emerging product lines to Slack may have a more negative impact that investors are budgeting for right now. With Atlassian's valuation so elevated, and with the stock reclaiming its spot as one of the most expensive names in SaaS software, I'm more inclined to take a backseat. Investors would be wise to lock in the (sizable) gains they've earned so far on Atlassian and wait for a better entry price."

It has been steadily climbing from the 52-week low of $31.2 in April last year.","Collaboration software maker Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) has had an impressive run in the two years that it has been public. It had a successful IPO that valued it at $5.8 billion, and today its value has almost tripled. The company recently reported another strong quarter and is taking strong strides toward annual revenue of $1 billion.Atlassian recently reported a strong third quarter that beat analyst estimates. Revenue in Q3 grew 40% to $223.7 million. Net loss narrowed to $14.3 million, or $0.06 per share, from $17.5 million, or $0.08 per share, a year ago. Non-IFRS net income increased to $24.6 million, or $0.10 per share, from $18.9 million, or $0.08 per share, last year. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $0.08 per share on revenue of $218.8 million.By segment, revenues from subscription rose 67% to $105.6 million, maintenance grew 22% to $81.9 million, perpetual license increased 9% to $21.3 million, and other revenues 49% grew to $14.9 million.During the quarter, Atlassian added 6,587 net new customers, taking its total customer count to 119,158. It ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $763.9 million.For the fourth quarter, the company expects revenue to be in the range of $232-234 million. IFRS gross margin is expected to be approximately 81%. IFRS Net loss per diluted share is expected to be approximately ($0.05), and non-IFRS net income per diluted share is expected to be approximately $0.12. While the revenue outlook beat analyst estimate of $232 million, the EPS forecast was below the average estimate of $0.14.For fiscal year 2018, Atlassian expects annual revenues in the range of $862-864 million. IFRS Gross margin is expected to be approximately 80%. IFRS net loss per diluted share is expected to be in the range of ($0.44)-($0.43). Non-IFRS net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.47-0.48. Analysts expect earnings of $0.48 per share on revenue of $857.4 million.During the quarter, the company appointed Dr. Shona Brown to the board of directors. Shona is a former member of the Google (GOOG, GOOGL) executive team. Atlassian also added Sasan Goodarzi to the Board. Sasan is executive VP and general manager of Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) Small Business and Self-Employed Group.The company also announced the opening of an R&D and customer support center in Bengaluru, India.Atlassian has several competitors. For its project management, collaboration and developer tools like BitBucket, its competitors include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM), and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE); while smaller competitors are GitHub that was last valued at $2 billion and Rally Software that was generating $24.5 million a quarter before being acquired by CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) for $480 million in 2015.For its service desk solutions, competitors include primarily public cloud vendors, including ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), and Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN), startup Freshdesk that is yet to go public, and legacy vendors such as BMC Software's Remedy. In point solutions for enterprise collaboration, it faces competition from Microsoft, IBM, Google, and Slack (SLACK).Last year, Atlassian acquired cloud-based team collaboration software maker Trello for $425 million. Trello has strengthened the company's capabilities in handling clients across business teams in legal, HR, Finance, marketing and sales. For fiscal 2018, Atlassian expects Trello to add $20 million in revenue. With the successful integration of the Trello acquisition under its belt, what other acquisitions are on the company's radar?As I have said in a recent post, SaaS companies have an unprecedented opportunity:I'm very impressed with the company's performance, and so is the market. The stock is trading at $57.09 with a market cap of $13.2 billion. It has been steadily climbing from the 52-week low of $31.2 in April last year."
4173645,21815,2018-05-14T08:11:08-04:00,"SaaS Business software companies offer some of the best business models and growth opportunities in the markets.The business model simply offers companies like Atlassian so many levers for increasing growth.Yet valuations are often sky-high, and Atlassian is certainly no exception, it is required to keep on growing into its valuation.Given the sky-high valuation, we can only say to buy on dips, which isn't right now.","The shares of cooperation software platform Atlassian (TEAM) have been on a tear:But as so often with these platform companies, the share valuation is extraordinary. There are good reasons for that, as these are some of the most solid business models around.We have developed a little platform of our own to analyze these platform business software companies. Their business models usually consist of the following elements, although not all of them equally important for every company (and some of these elements entirely absent at others).So how is Atlassian doing on these? We'll go through some of the more relevant points.Point 1, the company's killer app has been its team collaboration tool Jira, which was designed as a workflow management system for software development teams but its usage has moved beyond that and the company has added other collaboration and workflow tools.The company has lots of customers. From the company earnings deck:Point 2, moving to SaaS is in full swing with 80% of new products sales now in the cloud. The company also has a datacenter subscription revenue model (the software loaded on the client's own servers).However, they still see growth in the traditional license and annual maintenance business as well even if the growth here is just in the single digits. Here you see how the subscription part is increasing. From the company earnings deck:And as it happens, even the maintenance is some kind of subscription, at least it is recurring, from the 6-K filing:Point 3, expanding seats is an important source of growth, as management put it (Q3CC):Point 4, international expansion (from the 6-K):Of course, the company is Australian, so selling to the US can be considered international expansion already.Point 5, services, there is a service part in the maintenance revenue, see quote above under point 2.Point 6, building an ecosystem is an important plank of their strategy (6-K):It's important as the company doesn't employ its own sales force.Point 7 and 8, R&D is certainly relevant here, as management itself argued (Q3CC):The company has continued to expand its offerings like:The company offers a full description on the company website.Point 9, acquisitions is another avenue for the company to gain new functionalities, open new markets, customers and hence, cross-selling opportunities. And this is one area where the sky-high valuation of shares is a potential benefit.The company has done this for instance with Trello in January 2017 for $425M. Management argues it will contribute $20M or more in 2018 and they will introduce it to places where it would have been difficult for the company to go by itself, like Japan where it was recently introduced.Point 10, the company has a marketplace for third party applications for the Jira suite from which it collects a 25% royalty.TEAM Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsWhat you see above is serious revenue growth, more than doubling in three years, but this hasn't yet been accompanied by increased profitability. In fact, GAAP losses have increased.Perhaps that's why they increased prices last year (and changed mostly on a per user basis), and this was the first quarter where the effects of these expressed themselves in the figures.Management argues that there wasn't much of an effect (there was some pulling forward into Q1 and Q2 but that was not uncommon in other years either).Interestingly enough, management argues these price increases might be an annual event as management seems to argue the product is too cheap (Q3CC):The sequential growth (5%) might seem like it's slowing down compared to previous years (8%-9%), but at least some of that is optical due to the move to more ratable income (cloud and datacenters versus licenses).As a result, deferred revenue tends to grow somewhat faster than recognized revenue.TEAM Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsGAAP gross margin has declined a couple of points since 2016 and GAAP operating margin is still negative. On a non-GAAP (or more precise, non-IFRS) basis, the picture is somewhat better:But it's safe to say the company hasn't yet reached a point where there is substantial operating leverage. That isn't necessarily bad, the company is still in the 'land grab' phase and as long as the company generates sufficient cash flows to keep it from diluting too much it isn't a serious problem.TEAM Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsWhile the GAAP margins, EBITDA and earnings haven't shown improvement, cash flows have been solidly growing, but a substantial part of free cash flow is the result of stock-based compensation:TEAM Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsThis has also resulted in considerable dilution, and there is likely to be more of that coming as the company announced late last month (April 2018) that it is selling $900M of senior notes due in 2023, even if these are cash exchangeable notes:And now for the hard part...TEAM EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsAlthough this is a backward-looking figure, it's nevertheless rather high. Analysts expect non-IFRS EPS to be $0.48 this year, rising to $0.67 in 2019.Like many other business software SaaS platforms, the company has many ways to grow. It is still raking up lots of new clients, existing clients expand usage through purchasing new services and expanding existing ones through other parts of their organizations.The company also develops and acquires new functionality and even hikes prices on some existing ones. Perhaps at some stage, operational leverage will kick in although there is little sign of that yet.In fact, there is still a sort of negative leverage through share-based compensation and dilution.While it's nice for the company to show positive (and growing) cash flows and non-IFRS positive earnings, this is in large part due to substantial stock-based compensation.Needless to say, the valuation is off the charts, but they're hardly alone in this space, and to a considerable extent this is justified by the enormous growth opportunities this business model offers.We're no longer inclined to say the shares command too high a valuation, because each time we've done this with similar companies, the shares turned out to be higher still 6-12 months out.Keep in mind companies like this have to 'grow into' their valuation, but as long as the growth doesn't slow down too much and cash flows keep on improving, there is little to suggest the shares are about to face any major correction.Yet the shares have been volatile as you can see in the chart right at the start of the article, which leads us to suggest to buy on the dip, which doesn't seem to be right now, but there have been quite a few dips, at which point these trend lines come in handy."
4188323,104556,2018-07-19T09:22:42-04:00,"Atlassian's products are becoming increasingly relevant in a software-driven world.The company's unique operating model results in superior innovation.Though the company is richly valued, it is a name to keep an eye on because it is a fantastic business.","Though Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is considered overvalued by many investors, the company is undeniably a force to be reckoned with for three reasons: it's emphasis on teamwork, its unique business model, and its excellent financial position.Atlassian's name is inspired by the Greek Titan, Atlas, whose job was to serve the world by holding up the sky. In the same way, Atlassian seeks to serve its customers in the best way possible. All 119,000 customers. In the past two years, customer count has ballooned from just over 57,000 to now above 119,000. Clearly, the company's products resonate with a lot of people. But just what are the products?Atlassian sells software that ""unleashes the potential of every team."" Usually, that means software development teams. In today's software environment, working in teams is the norm with practices like agile development. Atlassian enables these teams to work more productively. JIRA, arguably, the company's most popular product, is the number one tool used by agile teams. Confluence is Google Docs-esque (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for content collaboration, BitBucket rivals GitHub, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) latest addition, HipChat is like Slack, JIRA Service Desk is mid-market ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and the list could go on.That is part of the reason why Atlassian can boast of so many customers. It has so many products that make life easier for developers and teams. But this didn't happen by accident.Atlassian intentionally spends a lot on research and development, which, I might add, has been correlated with superior stock returns. But I don't mean trivially more than the average company. Atlassian spends more than 40% of sales on R&D. To put that in perspective, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), known to be one of the most innovative companies, spent 34% of sales on fulfillment, technology and content, and capital expenditures in its latest quarter. For Amazon, this is basically the equivalent of R&D, though it might even overstate the number since I included capex.The reason that Atlassian can do this is because it spends relatively little on sales and marketing, an anomaly in the software world. The company usually spends about 20% of sales on S&M whereas some software companies like Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) and New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) spend upwards of 40-50%. Atlassian doesn't even have an enterprise sales force. That's right, they don't even have one! Instead, the company puts all of that energy into making the purchase process of its software low friction and high velocity. This means that its software is all self-serve with a low sticker price. Some products only cost $5/month. Therefore, developers don't need to get approved by upper management or finance to purchase these products. Furthermore, they don't need to be taught how to use it, so Atlassian doesn't need to employ sales people to travel around to different companies.This operating model is true to a Jeff Bezos quote from a past shareholder letter,The world is so interconnected nowadays that the best products seem to surface. Of course, if nobody knows about it, then it won't sell. But word of mouth travels much faster through the internet. Atlassian banks on this. The company hopes that developers try out one of its cheaper products, fall in love, and then continue buying other products. And, the strategy has worked thus far.In the latest quarter, Atlassian grew revenues by 40% to $224 million. Subscriptions were the main driver, shooting up 67% to $106 million, or 47% of total sales. Another 46% of sales were from license and maintenance contracts, and the last 7% was from Atlassian's Marketplace.The good news is that 80% of the new products sold were cloud-based, meaning more visibility for the company. I suspect that from now on, we will see more customers switch to cloud offerings to enable simpler updates since Atlassian is constantly adding features.Gross margins hovered around 80%, and operating losses narrowed from 14% of sales to just 5%. Most of this improvement can be attributed to a drop-off in stock-based compensation but a good sign nonetheless. The company also throws off a lot of free cash flow, a characteristic management is proud of. In the latest quarter, free cash flow margins were a mind-boggling 38%. It just goes to show you how powerful the company's operating model is.But great results usually mean rich valuations, and Atlassian is no exception. The company's enterprise value is $15.2 billion after backing out 700 million in cash from its market cap. TTM sales come out to $805 million. On a forward basis, assuming a conservative 30% growth, we get almost $1.05 billion in sales. This results in a 14.5x forward EV sales ratio, one of the richer valuations for a company of this scale.Even with 38% free cash flow margins, cash flow yield is sub-2%, revealing how dearly valued the company is. But you cannot deny how well Atlassian is doing.But, just like any company, Atlassian has some risks. For one, since it is so R&D-heavy, stock-based compensation (SBC) is fairly high. About 40% of the free cash flow comes from SBC, and it was about 16% of sales in the latest quarter. This results in some shareholder dilution. Over the past three years, diluted share count increased 50% or about 14% annually. But the fact of the matter is that the company needs to be generous to attract great software talent. But it is something to watch as prudent investors.Another risk is more existential. It will be interesting to see how big Atlassian can get without an enterprise sales force. To win huge contracts, it is a must. Just 1% of the company's total customers in 2017 spent over $50,000. This most likely means a decent amount of churn with the other 99% of customers since the purchase process is so simple. The downside of this is that customers aren't as locked in. However, Atlassian just wants the products to speak for themselves rather than forcing lock-in for the sake of profitability.Atlassian is Australian-based, off the beaten Silicon Valley path. But that isn't the only thing that makes the company unique. It has two co-founders who are also co-CEOs. Not to mention, these guys started the company when they were 21 and have pledged to spend around 40% of sales on R&D. And Atlassian doesn't even have an enterprise sales force. However, everything has worked out thus far.Take a look at this company as the world becomes more software-centric. Its tools enable developers to be more productive within team constructs, and this has resulted in stellar financials. Though the valuation is pretty steep, keep an eye on this one.Author's Note: Please scroll up and hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button so you can get these articles before they hit the paywall.

4164294,103480,2018-04-20T05:59:19-04:00,"Despite beating expectations for Q3 revenues and EPS, Atlassian shares sunk 7% in after-hours trading after reporting results.The company began to show a slight deceleration in its top-line growth, with its growth rate of just under 40% at its lowest point all fiscal year.Though growth is still accelerated from FY17, the slowdown may be causing some analysts to tweak their models for FY19.Guidance for the following fiscal year remains the biggest source of risk, as high-growth stocks like Cloudera that have guided softly have been punished.As compelling as Atlassian's story is, shares remain expensive at over 10x forward revenues.","Atlassian (TEAM), the collaboration software company, has yet again posted a stellar quarterly beat that was greeted with investor hesitation. All year long, the company has posted ~40% growth and bested Wall Street's expectations, but investors can't seem to find a reason to hang on to the stock post-earnings. Just like last quarter, Atlassian's stock fell more than 10% in extended trading after reporting its third-quarter results:TEAM data by YChartsYet, when you look at the leaps and bounds that Atlassian stock has made over the past year (rising about 2x), you can understand why investors are feeling particularly skittish.There's no doubt that Atlassian has achieved a lot over the past year. It integrated a major acquisition (Trello) and brought on its huge batch of customers, and the company also launched a Slack (SLACK) competitor called Stride, which went live in September of 2017. Slack, obviously, is the market leader in enterprise chat and it addresses a huge TAM. Taking on some of this market allows Atlassian to expand its use cases into an entirely new set of customers and generate bookings from existing ones, as the product folds well into its current suite of workflow and team-management tools.But valuation remains the ever-present question for this high-flying company. With the deluge of software IPOs recently (Dropbox (DBX), Zuora (ZUO), and Zscaler (ZS) are the three software companies that have gone public this year, with a handful more to come in Q2), as well as last year's batch of IPOs including Wall Street favorites like Alteryx (AYX), the market is in no shortage of high-growth software companies to choose from (the story was very different ~2 years ago, when the IPO window was effectively shut). Atlassian's high growth and positive free cash flow are no longer quite that unique of a value proposition, as companies like Dropbox feature the same strengths. This quarter's selloff seems like a classic case of buy the rumor, sell the news. With few positive catalysts coming up for Atlassian, investors are choosing to lock in their gains and put their capital to work elsewhere - as there are now plenty of growth stocks to invest in.A quick valuation check - at Atlassian's post-market trading price of $55.75, the stock carries a market cap of $12.74 billion. After netting out the $764 million of cash on its balance sheet, Atlassian has an enterprise value of $11.97 billion.If we assume that Atlassian will grow revenues at 35% in the next year (year-to-date for the three quarters through March 2018, Atlassian has produced 41% growth, so a ~600bps deceleration seems like a fair growth curve), we arrive at ~$1.02 billion in FTM revenues. This puts Atlassian's valuation at a rich 11.7x EV/FTM revenues, making it one of the highest valued companies in the sector.Atlassian is at best a hold, and I see a price target of no higher than $50 (10.5x forward revenues) in the near term. While the company has solid fundamental strengths, it's clear from investors' reaction to Q3 that a double-digit revenue valuation isn't quite sustainable anymore.Here's a glance at Atlassian's results for the quarter:Figure 1. Atlassian Q3 resultsSource: Atlassian investor relationsThe company broke slightly below 40% revenue growth for the first time all year, with growth of 39.9% this quarter decelerating about 180bps from last quarter's growth. Atlassian's revenues of $223.7 million still beat analysts' expectations for $218.4 million (+36.6% y/y) by a respectable margin, but clearly investors were hoping for more.Atlassian's customer growth continued to outperform, but investors are probably wondering the same thing: is deceleration about to happen more quickly than they had expected? Atlassian added about 6,600 customers in the quarter (versus 4,800 last quarter), with some big names including Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF). But as you can see from the chart below, the company has experienced step-function growth in the past from the acquisitions, particularly Trello in 2017. Unless the company can execute another meaningful M&A transaction going forward, FY19 might not see the same kind of growth rates.Source: Atlassian investor relationsAnd while Atlassian remains a customer favorite, the competition for the enterprise team/collaboration space is heating up. Facebook's (FB) Workplace offering is sure to get more executive attention after the huge fallout for its advertising business related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has merged its Skype offering into Microsoft Teams. Competitors abound, and the slew of options that customers face when buying collaboration software could pose a threat to Atlassian's growth.On the bright side, however, Atlassian is still showing extremely robust growth on the bottom line - which is one of the main bullish theses driving the stock's ascent. Part of the reason is that higher-margin subscription revenues continue to become a larger and larger proportion of the revenue base, with 67% of Q3 revenues owing to subscriptions (versus 64% in the prior year's Q3). Gross margin also saw a slight (40bps) uptick on a y/y basis.Operating expense was where Atlassian saw the most leverage. The company was able to reduce most of its major opex components as a percentage of revenues:Overall, pro forma operating income in the quarter (excluding the non-cash impacts of stock comp) grew to $38.4 million or 17.1% of revenues, a significant margin expansion from an operating margin of 15.3% in 3Q17. Atlassian's pro forma EPS of $0.10 also beat Wall Street's expectations of $0.08.Free cash flow, though, continues to be the biggest headline-grabber. Atlassian's FCF in the quarter was $86.4 million, up 27% y/y. Over the past three quarters, Atlassian has generated a stunning $216.8 million in free cash flow, up 56% y/y and representing an FCF margin of 43% - giving Dropbox a run for its money, with the latter at only a 28% FCF margin.In most cases, when a company sinks after posting an earnings beat, it's a good opportunity to buy. At first glance, everything at Atlassian seems to be doing just fine - growth is still strong, and margins and free cash flow continue to expand.However, the rich valuation that the stock has attained after its massive one-year rise has become a huge risk. In the face of possible deceleration and the risk of a lowball guidance range for FY19 when Atlassian reports its next earnings quarter (Q4), it's best to stay on the sidelines."

It was estimated to grow 10% annually to $8.96 billion by 2022 driven by the increasing adoption of bring your own device policies at work places. Billion-Dollar Unicorn Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is an established player in the market. Since listing, the company has had a solid run, and why not - it is a rock-solid company, always focused on fundamentals.Atlassian recently announced its second quarter results that surpassed market expectations on all fronts. Revenues grew 43% to $212.6 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $204 million. EPS of $0.13 also was a cent ahead of the Street's forecast. During the quarter, Atlassian recorded a non-cash charge to income tax expense of $47.3 million due to a write-down of deferred tax assets.By segment, revenues from subscription services grew 72% to $96.8 million, maintenance grew 24% to $80.4 million, perpetual license increased 20% to $21.8 million, and other revenues grew 58% to $14.7 million.Atlassian ended the first quarter with a total customer count of 112,571. It added 4,285 net new customers in the quarter. It also expanded its Marketplace segment and now has more than 3,500 apps. Overall, its business apps revenues surpassed $350 million in lifetime sales since its launch in 2012.For the current quarter, Atlassian expects revenues of $217-$219 million, and a non-IFRS EPS of $0.08. It expects to end the year with revenues of $853-$857 million and non-IFRS EPS of $0.47-$0.48. The Street was looking for revenues of $215 million and an EPS of $0.08 for the quarter and revenues of $842 million with an EPS of $0.46 for the year.Last year, Atlassian had introduced its latest team communication solution called Stride in direct competition with Slack. Stride was released as an early access program as the company is still working on rolling it out to its existing HipChat Cloud customers. Stride has some good features such as the ability to create a task out of a text post. Stride also includes video conferencing, audio call, and screen sharing options. But it lacks some of the key features such as the high customization offered by Slack and task-management views offered by RingCentral.Atlassian is working on phasing out Hipchat to replace it with Stride. It still does not have a clear timeline for the changeover. Right now, Stride is available as a web app, a desktop app for macOS, Windows, and Linux, and as mobile apps for iOS and Android.Initially, Stride will be available in two price tiers. The free service will come with unlimited users, group chat rooms, direct messaging, and group video chat, file sharing and 5GB storage, 10 apps or bots, Actions and Decisions coordination, and message history up to 25,000 messages.The premium version will be priced at $3 per user per month, and will include additional features such as advanced native Stride Meetings functionality, unlimited file sharing and storage, apps and bots, and message history, guest access, and user management.For comparison, Slack costs $8 per month per user, and RingCentral charges $5 per user per month for its service.Despite the impressive performance, Atlassian's stock fell nearly 5% post result announcement. Many believe that the decline was just a reaction of the market toward normalizing valuation. The stock has been trading at 12 times its revenue multiple, making it an already expensive stock. For now, the stock is trading at $52.26 with a market cap of $11.8 billion. It has been steadily climbing from the 52-week low of $26.97 in January last year. It peaked to $55.91 last week in anticipation of the results.I'm very bullish on this company primarily because it has a culture that has been focused on fundamentals for the longest time. I expect that it will continue to deliver solid results. The stock may be running slightly ahead of itself, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the company. Going after Slack is the right strategy for them at the moment, and I expect, they will figure out how to do so successfully within this year."

The venture capitalist and blogger has offered her commentary on Seeking Alpha for several years.In addition to sharing her insights into emerging companies and completed and pending IPOs, Mitra also shares her insight in well-established tech companies in our 2018 Outlook series. Her Q&A with editor Michael Hopkins follows.Michael Hopkins (MH): We like your focus on unicorns and start-ups, not only the basics and leadership behind each company, but also the fundamentals of the business. What are the big obstacles these new companies face? The need for capital? Recruiting and maintaining a strong workforce?Sramana Mitra (Mitra): The biggest problem I see is that often these so-called unicorns are growing without paying adequate attention to unit economics. This growth at all cost strategy isn't one that I believe in. And it has resulted in many ""death by overfunding"" situations that we've covered extensively in 2016 and 2017.(MH): It seems right now is a good environment for some of these fledgling companies to obtain capital and investment. Is that true? And what about 2018? Can start-ups and unicorns expect good access to funding in the near term and long term?(Mitra): Funding is abundantly available for late stage companies right now, and it will be so for a while. There's just too much capital in the system in the hands of large funds, so if the company has some merit, funding isn't an obstacle to growth.(MH): I'm guessing we'll see IPOs from notable companies (in tech and elsewhere) in 2018. Our question: Is an IPO always a viable option for these companies? Maybe staying private is the better course to take.(Mitra): More and more companies are opting NOT to go public. Enter Softbank Vision Fund. First close ~$100 billion. Targeting ~$1 trillion. They can gobble up anything and everything they want to. Many unicorns will exit into Softbank.(MH): Any notable IPOs that investors can expect in 2018?(Mitra): Maybe Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT). With Uber (NYSE:UBER) struggling with scandal after scandal, Lyft is in a good place. It's a much steadier, cleaner company.(MH): What should investors know about any upcoming IPOs. What are the risks? The opportunities?(Mitra): Look for a path to profitability. If that path isn't clear, you're likely to lose money. The opportunities are the bootstrapped companies that are going public like BlackLine (NASDAQ:BL) and Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM). They have good discipline, a culture of profitability and fundamentals, and will be more sustainable in the long term.(MH): Any unicorn or any other tech company that surprised you in 2017?(Mitra): Uber has been a disaster. The surprise is that it actually was brought down in a meaningful way by an employee's candid and powerful description of sexual harassment practices. They have been defying gravity for a long time. I wouldn't invest in that company now or anytime soon unless the new CEO shows he can clean up the culture mess.And Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will have a tough 2018, again, because of the fact that its core business practices are starting to come under scrutiny. Destroying democracy, turning society into a mass of addicted crazies, facilitating the spread of fake news… these are not going unnoticed. The stock will feel the impact.(MH): And any IPOs that surprised you this year?(NYSE:SM): Not really.(MH): We also like your focus on established companies in tech, especially mid-cap stocks. Can you share candidates you may have that investors should watch closely in 2018?(SM): Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is doing really well. Clean, non-controversial company. Solid numbers.(MH): In general, what ""surprise"" do you see in the market that isn't currently getting sufficient investor attention?(SM): Inequality is increasing. Social unrest is becoming more likely. How will this impact the stability of the current capitalistic system? The stock market bubble doesn't pay any attention to this systemic risk, but it is boiling under the surface. When does it come to the surface? I have no idea."
4192904,20521,2018-08-01T03:59:40-04:00,,"Collaboration and productivity software maker Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) recently reported an impressive fourth quarter. But what has impressed analysts the most is its partnership with rival Slack and its decision to get out of the communications market.Revenue in Q4 grew 40% to $243.8 million. Net loss widened to $25.9 million, or $0.11 per share, from $20.7 million, or $0.09 per share, a year ago. Non-IFRS net income increased to $33 million, or $0.13 per share, from $21.6 million, or $0.09 per share, last year. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $0.12 per share on revenue of $233.4 million.By segment, revenues from subscription rose 62% to $117.4 million, maintenance grew 22% to $87.3 million, perpetual license increased 16% to $22.5 million, and other revenues 53% grew to $16.5 million.During the quarter, Atlassian added 6,6038 net new customers, taking its total customer count to 125,796. It ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.7 billion, up from $763.9 million at the end of the third quarter. The company raised cash by selling $850 million of senior notes in April.Fiscal 2018 revenue grew 41% to $874 million. IFRS net loss widened to $119.3 million, or $0.52 per share, from $42.5 million, or $0.19 per share. Non-IFRS net income increased to $118.6 million, or $0.49 per share, from $84.9 million, or $0.36 per share.For the first quarter, Atlassian expects revenue to be in the range of $258-260 million. IFRS gross margin is expected to be approximately 82%. IFRS net loss per diluted share is expected to be approximately ($0.13), and non-IFRS net income per diluted share is expected to be approximately $0.19. Analysts expected earnings of $0.15 per share on revenue of $252.4 million.For the fiscal year 2019, Atlassian expects annual revenues in the range of $1.146-1.154 billion. IFRS gross margin is expected to be 82-83%. IFRS net loss per diluted share is expected to be $0.30. Non-IFRS net income per share is expected to be $0.77. Analysts expect earnings of $0.67 per share on revenue of $1.1 billion.Atlassian announced the general availability of Atlassian Access to give administrators company-wide visibility, control, and security over the Atlassian Cloud products, while providing users easy access to its collaborative tools. Atlassian Access allows Cloud customers to enable SAML single sign-on and enforce two-step verification and password policies. Pricing for Atlassian Access starts at $3 per user per month.Atlassian's strategic partnership with Slack has caught the fancy of analysts. The company currently has two offerings in the real-time communications market: Stride and Hipchat. With this partnership, Slack has acquired the intellectual property for Stride and Hipchat Cloud, both of which will be discontinued. Atlassian will also discontinue Hipchat Server and Data Center, and will be working with Slack to provide a migration path for customers of all four products.Atlassian products and Slack already work well together, and they expect to deepen their existing product integrations between Jira Cloud, Bitbucket Cloud, Trello, and Slack, and also expect to build new integrations between Confluence Cloud and Slack. They also expect to partner in the areas of marketing, sales, and channel enablement. Atlassian has also made an equity investment in Slack.Analysts are upbeat about the partnership. William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri says that the most prominent positive impact of the partnership will come from the R&D and marketing dollars that can now be reallocated to other product areas within Atlassian's ecosystem instead of trying to capture share in a market where Slack has a significant lead.Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis says that Atlassian's management is prudent in realizing that it is futile to fight to catch up when you can sell the assets to Slack, get a sliver investment in the pre-IPO firm, and then refocus on Atlassian's core tech-centric collaboration tools.Microsoft, look out!Its stock is trading at $71.08 with a market cap of $15.05 billion. It hit a 52-week high of $79.82 following the results, and has been steadily climbing from the 52-week low of $33.16 in September last year."
4134881,98236,2018-01-02T15:20:01-05:00,"Atlassian is one of the leading providers of software that allows collaboration within teams of software developers and many other kinds of workgroups.The company has seen a growth re-acceleration based on its expanding product suite and the success of its foray into providing IT help-desk software.Its newest product, Stride, is designed to compete in that part of the collaboration space where private company Slack has played a market leading role.The company's shares are not cheap, but they have recently pulled back about 14% and estimates have gone higher, making the valuation somewhat more attractive.The company has seen a significant rise in the growth of its deferred revenue balances as more of its customers move to subscription terms and more of its customers come from larger enterprises and data centers.","Full speed ahead is the latest message, I suppose. For those readers unfamiliar with the name, Atlassian (TEAM) is a leading provider of collaboration software - software that allows users to better collaborate in workgroups and teams with unhindered access to the right context, the bigger picture and the valuable information. I took that phraseology straight from TEAM's web site - far be it for me to try to improve on such a description. Whether it sounds valuable or not, it is part of the way that people work these days and if it doesn't resonate with some readers, it resonates with customers. While I think Atlassian makes sense as an investment, I can't help but wondering whatever happened to talking to co-workers, either in person or via phone, as an effective means of communication, or using what I remember as a GANTT chart to keep track of a project schedule. No matter, Atlassian will almost surely reach a $1 billion revenue run rate by the end of this current fiscal year, and its 42% topline growth last quarter was beyond what many observers were projecting.I confess that when recommending a momentum growth stock which is highly valued and well respected by many, there is always a bit of internal conflict. If everyone realizes something is good, then who is the next buyer. There is something of that in terms of writing about or investing in Atlassian shares. What brought me to writing an article about the name for the New Year was its 14% pullback in the last 6 weeks; the shares aren't cheap but at least they are on a bit of a sale.I confess that being older and a bit cynical - well perhaps more than a bit - leaves me with substantial skepticism about touchy-feely buzzwords and the new mantra of collaboration. Perhaps had this software been available when I worked in the corporate world, I might have gotten more done, with less stress. Perhaps my employees might have valued my opinions more if I didn't have to make them into commands. I confess to taking a large pinch of salt when I see the company describe its solutions as a facilitating ""bringing your full, truest self to work, while freely and openly contributing to the bigger picture."" But it is 2018 now, and professionals work differently today than was the case in decades past.This is an article about investing in Atlassian and not a commentary about the ethos of a software vendor. For better or worse, the world of work has changed substantially and in particular, the way work gets done by developers and other professionals who work in groups. Basically, software coding has become a social activity, and the use of workgroups in many endeavors has become essentially ubiquitous. And for this company in particular, which depends so much on viral selling in order to distribute its products, a marketing message geared to the modern ethos is probably as important as anything else.Many investors, in evaluating a particular business, typically want to see some form of competitive moat based on either technology or some other factor. While I think Atlassian has devoted substantial resources to developing differentiated products and its efforts have clearly had substantial success, the kinds of solutions it offers are complementary to its marketing message and again, to the modern ethos, even if I have my own personal reservations on the subject.I think it is fair to point out that part of the case for investing in this company is the undoubted talent of senior management and the team it has created. Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon - Brookes are co-founders and co-CEOs of Atlassian. They have received numerous awards through the years as leading tech entrepreneurs in Australia. While Atlassian has around 2000 contributors these days, this is very much a company in which the founders run the show and infuse the company with their vision. They seem to have a rare combination of business acumen and deep technology domain expertise and they are both very involved in the Australian VC community as an adjunct to their work at Atlassian. The men have been relatively modest in terms of their direct compensation from TEAM, although as each of them own about 70 million shares of TEAM stock, which is worth around $3 billion, salaries from Atlassian are probably not a priority. Neither man has sold shares in the past year, again, relatively unusual in the tech world. The company has an impressive board with very high - profile names represented. The board currently includes representatives of Bain Capital, Face Book (FB), Accel Partners (a venture investor), LinkedIn, Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Solv. I do not think that this company will lack for well qualified advice.Most recently, TEAM announced the appointment of James Beer as its CFO. Mr. Beer had been the CFO at McKesson (MCK) and Symantec (SYMC) as well as at American Airline (NASDAQ:AMR). Mr. Beer is replacing Murray Demo who had announced his retirement from the for - profit corporate world at the end of July. Mr. Demo has done a good job for Atlassian and has been trusted in terms of the many questions that have surrounded the operations of this company. The company has a mantra of openness and I assume that the incoming CEO will continue to operate in that fashion.Atlassian - the name is derived from Greek mythology where Titan Atlas is holding up the world - is a company headquartered in Australia, the home of its founders. It is incorporated in the UK, and therefore reports using the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standard) presentation. That said, it financial statements are issued based on USD, it has a significant headquarters in San Francisco and 51% of its revenues come from the Americas.Yes, I think that investing in this company's shares, which are quite highly valued, although a bit less so than recently, makes sense. It makes sense because the hyper-growth is likely to continue based on several trends I discuss further in this article, it makes sense because even at the current scale, TEAM is quite profitable on a non-IFRS basis, albeit with a significant contribution from stock-based comp, because TEAM is starting a significant ramp in its free cash flow generation and because the company has substantial opportunities to expand its footprint via opportunities in its current space.Atlassian shares are obviously vulnerable to a market downturn, and as mentioned below, some quarters, which look to be strong are not always positively received by investors, but over the long term, 40% growth, with additional margin opportunities at scale is a formula for producing positive alpha. The question is not that, but whether Atlassian can continue to execute at the levels it has achieved in its first 8 quarters as a public company?I initially wrote an article about TEAM in May of last year. Back then the shares were about $22, having reacted poorly to a beat and raise quarter. Now they are $46, and the shares have also seen a rather nasty reaction to another beat and raise quarter announced about 2 months ago. Over that span, the company has seen revenues rise from $118 million/quarter to $194 million/quarter, with free cash flow rising from $41 million to $63 million over the same period. In this last quarter, free cash flow more than doubled from the year earlier period. The company's 42% year over year top line growth last quarter actually represented a modest acceleration from the 40% rate that the company had reported just after it went public - the dreaded phase of growth compression and reversion toward the mean, a risk for investors in all hyper-growth IT companies, has been put off till sometime in the future. Almost all of the company's growth is organic; it did purchase a company called Trello, but Trello represented less than 0.5% of revenues in the first year it was owned by TEAM.The company has forecast topline growth of 38% for this current quarter and 36% for the year. Based on the limited history of this company as a public entity, it seems likely that full year growth will remain very close to 40%. I think that the inference to be drawn from the CFO's comment, that should this current quarter play out as expected (clearly more than what was guided to), the company will be in a position to give investors an update on revenue expectations for 2018. The company has not focused on improving IFRS (the European equivalent of GAAP) margins. IFRS margins are forecast to be a negative 13% for the current year, and that will be a bit worse than the negative 10% reported in fiscal year 2017. Gross margins are projected to be around 79% IFRS, down from 80.6% in the 2017 fiscal year. Some of that is a product of a mix swing away from perpetual licenses and toward subscription revenues.It should be noted that this company has, and will continue to increase prices over time for many of its offerings. This process could lead to higher gross margins than the company forecasts. Some analysts are concerned that the company has been too aggressive with regards to price increases. On the other hand, a brief perusal of some of the company's current pricing - linked here - suggests that this company has a very hard-working freemium model. For most of what it offers, Atlassian has been and remains the lowest price alternative.Part of the IFRS margin contraction this past quarter is also a function of the 82% increase in IFRS sales and marketing expense. Much of that is a function of the ballooning of depreciation and amortization expenses. Overall, depreciation and amortization expense rose by 6X and was 2/3rds of the reported IFRS pre-tax loss. Much of the depreciation and amortization charge was part of the sales and marketing expense bucket. Absent that charge, which was 20% of reported sales and marketing expense, the increase in ""real"" sales and marketing costs was 44%, still substantial and still a bit faster than revenue growth, but far less alarming. In fact, that metric, at 19% of revenues, is the lowest of any of the prominent hyper-growth IT vendors - a strategy which will be discussed below. The big outlier is research and development which rose by 40% on an IFRS basis and which is 62% of revenues.The real question for investors - and this writer - is whether TEAM is using this spend effectively to broaden its product line and to create a differentiated offering in what is notionally a crowded space.Positioning Atlassian in a crowded marketI think many investors, particularly when they look at tech, want to avoid getting enmeshed in trying to understand the bits and the bytes at any granular level. That is a bit difficult when considering an investment in Atlassian shares. This is a company that is all about the product it sells and far less about sales and marketing. Overall, the company spent 62% of its revenues, IFRS on research and development last quarter and it spent 18.5% of its revenues on sales and marketing - this time excluding depreciation and amortization expense but including stock based comp. As mentioned, stock based comp is a major expense bucket for this vendor and trying to analyze expense changes and comparisons any other way makes little sense. Overall, both of those ratios are extreme outliers. Atlassian products have more or less got to be attractive to its user base because almost all of the selling motion the company has is built around viral support.The company does not have a dedicated field sales force and in almost all cases it offers its products to users on a fixed price basis, i.e. with no-negotiation pricing and license structures, either using a subscription model or through the cloud. On the other hand, the company has a strong user community that helps evangelize for the company's offerings. Presumably there is some negotiation for deals encompassing hundreds of thousands of seats. Shades of the way Ubiquiti (UBNT) sells.Very specifically, 98% of the customers who purchased more than $50k in a given year, wound up buying more products the following year. The company's investor presentation sports a cohort analysis chart of the kind that is common to see these days, but sans numbers and sans the calculation of a dollar based net retention rate, it does not really further the analytical process. I hope that omission is corrected in the near future.Atlassian has several sets of products although they are all designed to help teams, often in the IT space, to collaborate and chat amongst themselves. Probably the best known of the Atlassian offerings is Jira, which is software that allows a workgroup to plan, track and mutually support projects. Jira Software is the product that is most used by Atlassian customers. It costs $10/month for up to 10 users and $7/ month for up to 100 users. Beyond that tier are further discounts per user negotiated individually. The product runs in the cloud and is set up and hosted by TEAM. Jira now has a Service Desk offering that has apparently become the 2nd largest vendor in the ITSM world. An allied offering is a product called Confluence which is another tool that allows teams, departments and projects to share knowledge and use a structured hierarchy with a search engine to keep track of all kinds of things such as notes, plans, requirements and can store multimedia and dynamic content.Other collaboration and chat products offered by TEAM include Trello, which is a tool for visual collaboration and Stride which is another way of communicating within a team. HipChat has been an extremely successful product that provides internal private online chat and instant messaging. Stride, which was introduced about 3 months ago, is a successor to HipChat, although the functionality is quite similar. HipChat Data Center is self-hosted with an annual subscription pricing model, while Stride is provided through the Atlassian Cloud. Stride is based on a freemium model, although presumably most users will wind up paying $3/month for a standard edition. Stride and HipChat compete with Slack which is perceived to be an alternative to Atlassian in its overall space.The company has products that specifically address the needs of coders and software developers including Bitbucket, Sourcetree and Bamboo. In this group, Bitbucket, which Atlassian acquired about 8 years ago is a freemium model which currently has 5 million developers and 900k teams on its platform. Bitbucket is available both in the cloud and on-prem and is used for source code and development projects. Bitbucket starts to cost money when used by larger teams. The product is really meant to provide access to something called Git, actually an open source control system originally created by Linus Torvalds.Without attempting to encapsulate the company's overall product roadmap in a single sentence, current development activities are based on rebuilding and integrating all of the company's offerings based on cloud - native technology. Atlassian has been focused on migrating its cloud infrastructure to run on a multi-tenant AWS platform. The advantages are in performance, overall and less latency and for Atlassian it is a key part of its strategy to appeal to larger users. At this point, 96% of the company's Jira and Confluence customers have moved to AWS, a very speedy migration. As mentioned earlier, this company runs on viral purchases by existing customers and making cross selling easier is a key part of the marketing strategy.If you can't figure out a name to describe the category into which a tech company fits, turn to Gartner, they will almost surely have developed a category to fit the company. Atlassian is described by Gartner as a leader in a category called Enterprise Agile Planning Tools. In the leader's space along with TEAM are Microsoft (MSFT), CA (CA), and VersionOne. I have linked here to the Gartner evaluation as well as an evaluation of Atlassian's Jira versus VersionOne. At the moment, no one has been able to define the size of the total available market for agile tools with any precision. There are lots of developers in the world these days - millions or tens of millions and they exist outside of just the software space including teams developing drugs or sequencing genes or researching polymers or developing a new brand of soap or even working on a new technology for making a windmill or a solar farm, and while the average cost per seat for most tools is quite low, many users deploy several different tools and use them in different ways. It is not unusual for Atlassian customers to use 5 or 6 different products and that makes the TAM addressed by even the current product set reach tens of billions of dollars. Many of the use cases are not those that come readily to mind when thinking of who Atlassian might sell to. For example, FlixBus, which has been spun out of DB (German Rail), has 5 Atlassian products which it has used to create and optimize a long - distance bus service and to build a website for its users that includes network planning and dynamic price management. A more typical user would be Fresh Consulting which uses Bitbucket to store the code it builds for its clients, Bitbucket Pipeline to help test and standardize code and to enforce coding standards and to detect potential security vulnerabilities and Jira software as a development tool.TAM is probably an overworked concept these days and I sometimes find myself wondering about its utility in determining the potential growth opportunity for a given company. While there is no agreed - on TAM for the solutions offered by Atlassian, I think it is more or less self-evident that the company's growth in the foreseeable future is unlikely to be limited by the number of potential organizations that can use its products. Last quarter, netting out the customers recorded as new because of the a new Bitbucket pricing model, Atlassian closed 4200 net new customers (each new domain is counted as a new customer) close to a record for a single quarter.Given the way that Atlassian sells, in which it has to be continuously selling additional products to its installed base in order to maintain its growth rate, its ecosystem is key. Atlassian Marketplace solutions are likely to be a significant growth source for this company going forward. I think trying to quantify the opportunity the company has by focusing on a TAM makes less sense than it might for some other companies in the IT space that sell within a more readily defined space.Very often, Atlassian, its HipChat product and now Stride are compared to competitive offerings from a company called Slack. Slack is a private company that has most recently been valued at something more than $5 billion, compared to the current enterprise value of Atlassian of around $10 billion. I think the comparison is telling, given just how much more technology Atlassian has on offer compared to Slack. Slack has run through a substantial amount of cash lately, but regardless of its financial performance (probably below what is necessary for the company to be able to launch an IPO), it has clearly been considered a thought leader in the space described as team communications service. A couple of months ago, Atlassian introduced a product it calls Stride which is designed to overcome the competitive advantages Slack has been thought to have. I am not even going to try to describe in any details why Stride might be better than Slack - it is hard enough keeping up with all of the names the vendors use for all of their products but as mentioned earlier, the basic premise behind Stride is that users can find both a smart, text-based messaging service and a fully featured video and audio conference service on a single platform at a reasonable price. For those readers who want a more in - depth evaluation of the differences between Slack and Stride, I have linked here to an article from TechCrunch. While it is always hard to handicap new products specifically, I think that the impact of Stride on Atlassian's percentage growth rate is likely to be visible in the quarter to be reported later this month and throughout calendar year 2018.JIRA Service Desk is a substantial revenue contributor at this point for Atlassian and is said to be its single fastest growing major solution set which suggests that growth is likely to be at or above 50%/year. It is clearly gaining share in what is called the ITSM market. Service Desk is an offering that in whole or part is designed to offer users similar functionality to that offered by ServiceNow (NOW). Development activities have included a ""white-label"" option so that users can integrate Service Desk with the rest of their website. And the company has enabled its new Jira Cloud as a tool to allow its users to pull up customer information from their Salesforce (CRM) data, and soon other popular CRM solutions, directly from the Jira Service Desk.At this point, when most potential customers and certainly investors think of Service Desk offerings in the ITSM space, they think of ServiceNow. Although the ITSM space is crowded with contenders, for some years now ServiceNow has been the unchallenged leader with a market share of greater than 36%, and probably rising. ServiceNow is ranked as one of two leaders by Gartner which can be seen in this year's ITSM report linked here. Atlassian is not ranked at all - although based on current market growth it seems reasonable to anticipate that Jira Service Desk will be rated by Gartner in its next ITSM review. On the other hand, in a study linked here from a well-known service called ""Apps Run the World"", Atlassian is shown as having a 16% share, 2nd only to ServiceNow. Interestingly, both Atlassian and NOW have reported growth in the 40% range in the most recent quarter, although I imagine that in the ITSM category alone, Atlassian is probably growing somewhat faster from a smaller base as NOW diversifies into other IT categories.I have linked here to a 3rd party evaluation of Jira vs. ServiceNow. That said, the evaluation from Valiantys cannot really be said to be unbiased as the firm is a Jira/Confluence solution partner. On the other hand, many of the points in the evaluation are reasonable and can be verified. I have linked to the best available source regarding the size of the ITSM market - said to be worth almost $9 billion in a few years' time. Jira Service Desk clearly has a more user - friendly GUI and probably has some features that NOW has not incorporated at this point. And it is much cheaper to lease and probably has an overall lower total cost of ownership although that is harder to calibrate for a writer situated as I am. But the ITSM space is not one with just a single winner, and to suggest that Jira will probably grow a bit more rapidly and win a few more competitions in which it is involved, compared to NOW, doesn't suggest that NOW is a bad stock to own, as I pointed out in a recent article.Looked at overall, there are more reasons for Jira Service Desk to be successful than not. The continuing success of Service Desk will have much to do with the ability Atlassian to continue its strong of hyper-growth quarters and I believe the auguries are favorable. Overall, it is my contention that Atlassian's hyper-growth status is more likely than not here to stay for the foreseeable future.Yes, Atlassian is expensive when using many traditional valuation parameters, and the course of its stock price, besides reflecting its own operational performance, is clearly correlated to the valuations investors are according to a broad universe of hyper-growth tech names. As mentioned earlier, Atlassian has an enterprise value of a bit under $10 billion. The company has forecast revenues for this current fiscal year (ends 6/30/18) of about $845 million. Looking at the next 4 quarters, I think using a revenue estimate of about $980 million seems reasonable. That in turns calculates to an EV/S estimate of around 9.8X. Many readers are simply not going to consider purchasing an equity with an EV/S of 10X. And I make no suggestion that the shares would not be vulnerable in a significant market pullback. But there simply aren't all that many comparables that have the ability to sustain growth at 40% for some substantial time period. I previously mentioned NOW as a competitor, and to some degree a comparable. NOW actually has an EV/S of about 9X, lower than Atlassian on that metric, but with a growth rate estimate for 2018 of only 31%.Atlassian forecast non-IFRS EPS at $.47 for its current fiscal year during its last conference call. This was an increase from the $.43 the company had forecast the prior quarter with a tax rate assumption of about 33%. The company has had a history of beat and raise quarters since it has been public (last quarter, fiscal Q1, was a $.03 beat on a prior $.06 non - IFRS EPS forecast), and I have little reason to doubt that this kind of pattern will not continue to reprise.It is somewhat difficult for outsiders to estimate what the company's non-IFRS tax rate will really be going forward until the company reports its results and presents its new tax rate outlook later this month. I think that given the company's historical track record of beating expectations and with a 26% non-IFRS tax rate accrual guesstimate, EPS for the next 4 quarters, i.e. calendar 2018, could reach $.60. That would be a forward P/E based on non-IFRS earnings of about 75X.Stock based comp was more than all of the earnings that this company reported for both the latest quarter reported this year and the comparable quarter the prior year. In the quarter, stock based comp expense rose by 47% compared to the 42% growth in reported revenues. For better or for worse, the company has no current goal to improve its IFRS margins. As mentioned earlier, IFRS operating margins were a negative 10% in fiscal year 2017 and are forecast to be a negative 13% in the current fiscal year. That said, the current forecast represents more than 300 basis points of improvement in the IFRS margin forecast compared to the projection made at the end of July.Recommending momentum growth stocks is a fraught enterprise. They work in certain markets and not in others. The fact that TEAM shares have fallen by 14% since they made a high in the middle of November has more to do with investor sentiment regarding highly-valued names rather than any specific change in the outlook for this company. I think that the cadence of growth, and the ability of the company to generate free cash flow will be the drivers for share price appreciation, rather than some sterile argument about the level of stock based compensation.Atlassian, over time, is likely to be more of a cash flow story than current numbers might suggest. As part of the earnings release last quarter, the company raised its guidance for free cash flow by about 8.5%. Part of that increase relates to the forecast for improved GAAP profitability compared to its prior expectations cited above. But the major swings in operating cash flow items, were the outsize change in deferred revenues which almost trebled year on year coupled with a substantial increase in depreciation and amortization which almost doubled. While this company doesn't forecast billings, and thus it is hard to really calibrate what expectations were for that metric, the billings upside was quite a bit greater than the upside in reported revenues. According to management, as Atlassian becomes a more recognized IT supplier, increasing demand is coming from its customers using the products in the data center and adopting a subscription based consumption model. In all, the company's deferred revenue balance grew by 9% sequentially, and that was in a Q1, a period when deferred revenue balances more typically decline.Overall, subscription revenues rose by 71% while perpetual license revenues were only up by 14%. Inevitably, subscription revenues, particularly those sold to larger organizations, will generate more deferred revenue due to annual billing cycles. As mentioned earlier, the new offering, Stride, is only offered on a subscription basis, and it is likely to be one of the single largest revenue generators for Atlassian. So, I think the growth of deferred revenues is likely to be outsized, at least over the next year, and possibly longer than that.Trying to forecast free cash flow for the next 4 quarters is likely to be one of the more imprecise set of expectations for a company growing as fast as Atlassian. So far, the company has not seen any material expansion of its balance sheet despite its rapid growth. I think it would be prudent to imagine that receivables, at the least, will start to show increases going forward. I think using a free cash flow estimate for the next 4 quarters for this company of $300 million, while probably conservative is about as reasonable an expectation as one can suggest using the most recent experience and company guidance. Is a 3%+ free cash flow yield an adequate return that justifies owning these shares?In looking at comps, which is the only rational way to attempt to answer that question, the problem is that there simply are very many companies that have positive free cash flow yields, with reported revenues rising at greater than 40% and bookings rising at more than 50%. I just do not see that many comps with similar records - and those that I do see, such as Arista Networks, (ANET), have similar valuations, in whole or in part. (Arista does have a lower P/E, but Arista still is a hardware company, although a hardware company selling a software defined networking solution - most investors, for a variety of reasons, will not quite pay the same valuation for a company perceived as being a hardware vendor).As I have written before on this site, I self-limit the names in my growth portfolio to 11 which means I miss out on some opportunities. And I confess that the past 6 weeks have suggested to me that tech stocks are more likely than not to take a breather from the torrid pace of appreciation that they sustained in the first 9-10 months of 2018. But for investors who are willing to look past shorter-term trading issues, Atlassian is surely a name to consider in anyone's high growth IT portfolio. I see it continuing to sustain hyper-growth for many years in the future, and with steeply rising cashflow, its valuation can be readily justified."
4138597,103480,2018-01-19T07:24:26-05:00,"Atlassian, the enterprise collaboration software company, reported Q2 results that beat on the top and bottom line.Revenue growth even modestly accelerated to 43% y/y, up from 42% y/y in Q1.The stock, however, sank ~5% in aftermarket trading, as the beat failed to impress investors. Perhaps one reason is that the EPS beat was modest and IFRS operating margin sank.Trading at ~12x forward revenues, Atlassian is already one of the most expensive software stocks, so it was long overdue for a pullback.With few positive catalysts on the horizon post-earnings, many investors will be locking in their huge (100%) gains on Atlassian over the past year.","Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) has been nothing short of a behemoth in the stock market in the past year. The enterprise software company - known for its enterprise workflow and collaboration tools that rival the likes of Slack - has outperformed nearly every other mid-to-large cap software stock in the market in 2017 and even continued its massive run into the beginning of 2018. In the past 12 months alone, Atlassian is up more than 100%, as shown below, with most of the gains occurring in Q4 (Atlassian's fiscal Q2) of last year:TEAM data by YChartsUnlike some other software stocks that have been blessed with extraordinary performance (like Appian (NASDAQ:APPN), whose rally was driven by phantom forces), Atlassian's gains are actually supported by valuation - even through this quarter, the company has shown stellar revenue growth backed by amazing cash flow growth.But there is a point at which even top-notch fundamentals become insufficient to support a company's towering stock price. Back when I first wrote on the company in early September, it was already trading at 9x forward revenues at its then-stock price of $35. This was already a decent premium relative to other companies in its peer set - yet I believed Atlassian's growth and cash flow margins deserved the premium.I'm glad I bought the stock when I did, but I've since locked in my gains (disappointed on missing out on ~20%, but looking back, my reasons are sound): there's no safety net in holding a stock whose valuation has soared to a low-teens multiple of revenues.I think the market's reaction to a solid quarter from Atlassian says it all: the majority of investors are wanting to take their feet off the pedals for Atlassian. Yes, it's a solid company and its recent new product offerings, like Stride (a video-conferencing app meant as a direct swipe at Slack), have been well received by the IT community, but valuation does have its limits.The point to drive home here: if even can accelerating revenue quarter can't convince investors to keep pumping buy orders into Atlassian, nothing else can. With a major product release recently under its belt and few positive catalysts on the horizon, Atlassian will likely trade sideways or see a more pronounced pullback in the first half of 2018.As I said, though, the quarter was a fantastic one on all but one front (IFRS operating margins - we'll get to that), so it would be a disservice not to point out Atlassian's fundamental wins in the quarter.Atlassian's revenues were $212.6 million in the quarter, up 43% y/y. This was a fairly substantial beat to analyst expectations that called for $204.4 million (+37% y/y), making this quarter's results a six-point beat on the top line. As previously mentioned, Atlassian had grown at 42% last quarter, and analysts clearly weren't expecting revenues to accelerate (nor was the company expecting it - its high end of guidance for Q2 called for only $205 million), so it's highly likely that Atlassian's new offerings surprised to the upside in the quarter for all parties (Not to belabor the point, but if a combination of a six-point beat and acceleration produces a 5% after-hours drop, then there mustn't be much enthusiasm left for the trade, at least in the short term).See the company's Q2 revenue results below, noting also that Atlassian's most-watched revenue component, subscription revenues, also grew a whopping 70% y/y to $95.8 million.Figure 1. Atlassian Q2 revenueSource: Atlassian Q2 earnings releaseAtlassian also added 4,246 net new customers in the quarter, bringing its total active customer base to 112.6k at the end of the quarter. The chart below, taken from Atlassian's earnings deck, shows how its customer base has grown:Figure 2. Atlassian customersSource: Atlassian investor relationsGross margins also remained relatively steady in the quarter at a high 80%. Top line metrics all checked out, so where the company disappointed slightly was IFRS operating margin (yes, IFRS and not GAAP - the company is dual-headquartered in Sydney and London).On an IFRS basis, Atlassian produced -$15.3 million in operating income (-7% margin) relative to just -$2.6 million (-2% margin) in the prior year's Q2. This five-point widening in its losses is a major concern, as companies that reach Atlassian's scale are typically able to gain leverage improvements on their opex. It's true that Atlassian did unveil major products during the quarter, and that the major culprit behind the stacking losses is 45% y/y growth in R&D spend to $101.3 million - spending 48% of revenues on product development is surely steep, but we can't fault a tech company for wanting to stay competitive on the innovation curve. Still, however, investors were probably hoping for more efficiencies.Non-IFRS losses, however (which primarily strip out stock-based comp), saw an improved margin - to positive 21%, up from 19% in the prior year. Here's a look at the addbacks between IFRS and non-IFRS operating income:Figure 3. Atlassian non-IFRS margin bridgeIt's clear that a rise in stock comp is the main driver behind the gap between IFRS and non-IFRS earnings, as well as amortization charges for acquisitions. Despite the merits of using non-GAAP operating income as a better picture of Atlassian's cash earnings, investors probably won't be too pleased to hear about growing dilution in shares.In line with this narrative, despite the massive beat on the top line, Atlassian's pro forma EPS of $0.13 beat analyst consensus of $0.12 by just a measly penny, implying that Wall Street had higher margins baked into its models.Cash flow at the company, however, remained strong, and it's one of the primary bullish drivers behind Atlassian (even though it's probably not enough to support the company's valuation today). Free cash flow grew 52% y/y to $67.8 million, representing 32% of revenues (up from 30% last year):Figure 4. Atlassian free cash flow resultsIn spite of good results, however, Atlassian's valuation has seemingly reached its upper bound.The company has raised its FY18 guidance to $853-857 million, up from the $841-847 million guidance it gave last quarter. Note that the company's new guidance range implies 38% y/y growth over last year's FY17 revenue of $619.9 million. Atlassian is also guiding to FCF of $260-270 million of free cash flow in the quarter, up from a prior guidance range of $250-260 million. See the company's guidance summary below:Figure 5. Atlassian's refreshed guidanceSource: Atlassian investor relationsTo put these numbers into a valuation context, at Atlassian's current share price of $53, the company has a market cap of $12.1 billion and an enterprise value of $11.4 billion, stripping out its ~$670 million of net cash. This implies that Atlassian currently trades at a valuation of:There's no need to even stack this up against other expensive mid/large-cap software companies, but we can look anyway - Atlassian's valuation eclipses them all:TEAM EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThere's no sense in paying such a high premium for Atlassian at this time, especially when there aren't likely to be many upcoming catalysts that could vault the company's valuation higher (an unlikely scenario no matter how good the catalyst). By all means, Atlassian still is fundamentally a strong company, but there can often be a disconnect between company fundamentals and valuation - even Elon Musk has been known to declare Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) share price as expensive. Being Atlassian now would be like paying Porsche prices for a Mercedes - you're getting a good car, just overpaying for it.Steer clear of Atlassian until its valuation comes down to a more reasonable multiple. The company has, in the past few months, found resistance points in the mid-$40s, so if and when shares collapse to those levels, you might want to consider a long position, but not until then."
4104245,103480,2017-09-05T15:03:35-04:00,"Atlassian is a high-flying and expensive cloud stock trading at 9x forward revenues, but a recent pullback provides a buying opportunity.The company sells a well-loved collaboration app with strong SaaS billings, deployed by 89k customers large and small.While not profitable on a GAAP basis, the company is projecting 25%+ free cash flow growth.The FCF growth story provides a strong foundation for the company's high revenue valuation.","There's nothing I love more than a rebound stock. Valuations skitter around from day to day, but eventually have a tendency to return to historical averages, barring any sudden disruption in fundamentals.Atlassian plc (NASDAQ: TEAM), the Sydney-based provider of team collaboration software, is one such stock. It's been a highflier and a software sector favorite for a long time, similar to Workday (NYSE: WDAY), but a recent pullback from highs near $40 to $35 provides a rare buying opportunity in a best-in-class app with strong industry fundamentals, rampant growth and a brewing profitability story.TEAM data by YChartsIn July, Atlassian announced a series of price changes that moves the majority of its customer base to per-user pricing, similar to how a majority of cloud-based apps are billed. Previously, Atlassian's pricing had been a flat rate based on user tiers (250+; 500+, etc.). Assuming the price change doesn't invite too much churn in the existing customer base, the move is expected to lift the company's top line.Atlassian is expected to report 1Q18 earnings in late October. Continued growth in the software vendor's customer base (it currently has 89,000 paying customers) and positive impacts from the pricing change should see a re-rating in the stock back to its historic 10x multiple, implying a price target of $40. Investors who build a position pre-earnings are well positioned to see a rebound in the stock and earn ~20% in gains.Atlassian's product portfolio can be thought of as serving two primary use cases: team collaboration and service desk management.The first area, collaboration, is the company's primary business and will be the focus of this article. Atlassian's primary offerings in collaboration are JIRA, a workflow management system that was originally developed to help software development teams collaborate and manage their projects; Confluence, which helps teams share and organize content; HipChat, an enterprise instant messaging application; and Trello, which Atlassian acquired in January for $425 million and serves similar needs to JIRA and Confluence.In its secondary area, Atlassian offers the JIRA Service Desk, which helps service team members manage their workflow and handle incidents (think of the IT or HR professionals at your company who answer your queries). Atlassian first introduced Service Desk in 2013, eleven years after its founding in 2011, and it competes with the likes of Salesforce's (NYSE: CRM) Service Cloud, Zendesk (NYSE: ZEN), and ServiceDesk.The media (and Wall Street) turn a lot more focus to Atlassian's collaboration portfolio as it's the bigger chunk of the business, and also the space that's seen as heating up in Silicon Valley.Figure 1. Atlassian JIRA SoftwareJIRA (demo screen pictures above) allows teams to visualize, plan, and distribute workflows among team members, and track progress toward the goal. Originally intended for software development teams, Atlassian highlights that the software has also been adopted for other use cases in product design, supply chain, and legal document review. To that end, Atlassian bifurcated the JIRA offering in October 2015, marketing JIRA Software toward engineering teams and JIRA Core toward non-developer users.HipChat (pictured below) is Atlassian's enterprise chat offering. This is the space that's garnered much media attention, especially after Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) launched Facebook at Work in October 2016 and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) launched Microsoft Teams in March 2017 - the enterprise chat arena is seen as an emerging battleground in Silicon Valley. And of course we can't forget Slack, the $5 billion private unicorn that's seen as the darling in corporate chat.Figure 2. Atlassian HipChatWhile Slack and the newer entrants are backed by massive cash-rich companies and venerable brands, they appear (as of yet) to not be seamlessly integrated with workflow tools like Atlassian's JIRA, though this gap will likely be filled in short order. At the current moment, tools like Slack employ APIs to integrate with third-party workflow tools, including JIRA. Atlassian is not slacking on the product development front, however. Unlike most enterprise software companies, Atlassian does not employ a direct sales force - it invests most heavily in R&D. This is an uncommon move in the enterprise software space, where it's the norm for high-growth companies to devote 50-60% of spend (and headcount) toward deal-charging sales reps.Atlassian communicates its product-focused culture effectively to its customers, and Atlassian's native integration between JIRA and HipChat give it a competitive edge over services like Facebook at Work and Slack, which have no collaboration tools of their own.Atlassian also offers the Atlassian Marketplace - a third-party marketplace of applications designed to work for the JIRA suite. To date, more than 3,000 add-ons and extensions are featured in the Marketplace, and since its inception in 2012 it has generated $250 million in third-party sales. Atlassian typically gets a 25% royalty cut from apps sold in this marketplace - so although it's not a meaningful portion of Atlassian's top line, it is essentially a source of ""free"" revenue and has the dual benefit of enlarging Atlassian's brand.Gartner also recognizes Atlassian's prominence in the collaboration space - it has named the company in the Leaders quadrant of its April 2017 edition of the Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Agile Planning Tools, though we note Microsoft also shares the quadrant with it (though not for Microsoft Teams). JIRA is also well reviewed on G2Crowd (an enterprise software ratings site), earning 4.1/5 stars, with customers praising its wealth of features and its ability to create either complex or simple workflows for teams.As mentioned earlier in the article, Atlassian rolled out new per-user pricing for its cloud edition on July 31 (Atlassian's products are available either as a hosted cloud version or on-prem). In its prior iteration, Atlassian charged companies based on user tiers: 26-50 users, 51-100 users, 101-250 users, etc. Now, Atlassian is charging per user - potentially supercharging its billings for customers who were billed at the higher ranges of its tier brackets.The below pricing screenshot shows JIRA Software's new pricing per user:Figure 3. JIRA Software pricingVolume-based discounts are available after the first 100 users; for example, a team with 250 users pays $5.20 per head, and a team with 500 pays $3.10.JIRA Service Desk also got a pricing revamp, charging $20/month per agent on the platform, and volume-based discounts after the first 20 agents.For a flavor of how Atlassian's other products are priced, Confluence starts at $5/user/month and HipChat is $2/user/month, though HipChat had always been priced per user. Each module is priced separately, meaning Atlassian derives separate subscription revenue streams from each of its products, much in the same way that Salesforce bills revenue from each of its clouds.Pricing comparisons in the collaboration and service desk areas are difficult to compare as most competitors have them bundled with other services, but enterprise chat pricing is readily comparable.HipChat's price of $2/user/month in the premium tier (Atlassian also offers a free edition with a limited feature set) is actually extremely competitive with its peers in the chat space.Let's start with a comparison against Facebook at Work, which charges between $1-$3 per month depending on its user brackets:Figure 4. Facebook at Work pricingBoth Facebook and HipChat are significantly cheaper than Slack, which charges $6.67 for its premium tier (the free version shown below is comparable to HipChat's free tier):Figure 5. Slack pricingIt's unknown how HipChat stacks up pricing-wise relative to Microsoft Teams, as Microsoft rolls its chat capabilities into a bundle with an Office 365 subscription. However, on the whole, HipChat is extremely attractive pricing-wise relative to its peers, and with native integrations to JIRA, a unique feature in the space, Atlassian is a force to be reckoned with in both enterprise chat and collaboration.Atlassian capped off its fiscal 2017 in June with another year of stunning top-line growth. Revenues grew 36% to $620 million, and the $1 billion mark is within sight between one and two years out - few software companies ever reach this stage standalone.Figure 6. Atlassian revenueMost notably, subscription revenues grew 65%, as the company is making an effort to shift its customers into cloud subscriptions. Accordingly, perpetual license revenues and its associated maintenance fees are seeing a slowdown in growth, but as these billings are far less profitable than low-touch cloud accounts, this is a net positive for Atlassian.The Other revenue line captures Atlassian's 25% royalty from third-party extensions sold on Atlassian Marketplace. While this is the smallest slice of revenue, it delivers nearly 100% pure profit. A growth figure of 45% highlights Atlassian's traction with developers. A rich ecosystem of third-party apps creates a virtuous cycle for the JIRA brand and brings more potential customers into the fold.Atlassian ended the year at 89,000 paying customers, a 46% increase over 2016 and a marked acceleration over 25% growth from 2015 to 2016.Figure 7. Atlassian customersTo continue the growth acceleration theme, Atlassian's revenue actually accelerated in Q4 relative to Q3 of 2017. See the chart below from Atlassian's earnings materials:Figure 8. Atlassian revenue accelerationShould the company continue to accelerate into 1Q18, the stock could see meaningful upside - acceleration is always coveted and chased by growth investors, and given Atlassian's trend, it wouldn't be an impossible ask.Growth aside, the other important piece of the Atlassian story is its rapidly accelerating cash flow. Generally with software stocks, you get one or the other: stellar growth or stellar cash flow. Cash flow is usually a sign that the product has matured and that the company is starting to transition into milking it for profits, but with accelerating growth, this doesn't seem to be the case for Atlassian.Figure 9. Atlassian free cash flowThe company delivered 92% cash flow growth in 2017, ending the year with free cash flow of $183.3 million. Though the company's stock-based comp has pressured GAAP earnings, the company has been FCF profitable for many years, an indicator of a well-managed company with a sustainable growth trend. Atlassian is also forecasting $230 - $240 million of free cash flow in 2018, implying 28% y/y growth at the midpoint - though we believe this estimate is conservative, as the company has opportunity to outperform on both margins and top-line acceleration.Management is guiding to $826-$834 million of revenue in 2018, pointing to 34% y/y growth at the midpoint - though if the acceleration trend continues, we could see several quarters of beat-and-raise earnings raising that target much higher. There is conservatism built into the company's (and Wall Street's) models, allowing investors to profit from considerable upside.By no means is Atlassian a cheap stock. Trading at ~9x forward revenues, it's up in the highest echelons of software valuations. However, it's not alone up there. Take a look at the chart below:Figure 10. Atlassian trading compsNote on methodology: forward revenues are based on an extrapolation of management guidance; balance sheet figures are taken from the most recent quarter and market cap is based on close of trading on September 1, 2017.The purpose of this chart is not to construct an average or a target multiple for Atlassian - when software stocks reach this high in the valuation stratosphere, such targets are difficult to aim for. What this chart is intended to show, however, is the fact that there are companies that trade at Atlassian's valuation - indeed, much higher. And Atlassian's fundamentals, -10% operating margins stacked against 37% growth, certainly stacks up favorably to companies like Autodesk or Workday.Also bear in mind that 9x forward revenues when supported by a 37x OCF multiple is not outrageous, especially when backed by strong guidance in revenue and FCF growth. If the company achieves a doubling in cash flow (what it was able to achieve this year), that 37x OCF multiple gets sliced in half to ~18x OCF - a bargain for a growth company by any standards, in any industry.Given Atlassian's solid fundamentals, unique positioning in the collaboration space, and rare combination of growth and cash flow, 10x ($40) is not too aspirational of a price target to set for the company; indeed, growth acceleration could send the stock even higher.Product is everything in the software industry, and analysis of a software company's financials without the context of its product is almost meaningless. Fortunately for Atlassian bulls, the company is backed by a fantastic product that's achieved meaningful traction in the enterprise collaboration marketplace. And with Atlassian's no-sales, product-is-everything mentality, this best-of-breed distinction is unlikely to fade.Growth stories are commonplace in the software industry, but growth at scale is the Silicon Valley nirvana that few companies succeed in reaching. Not only has Atlassian been FCF profitable for a number of years, but it's growing that free cash flow at astronomical rates.The company trades at a premium for a reason, but the recent market-encompassing pullback in growth stocks has made Atlassian stock temporarily cheap. Buying windows for a company like this are rare, so investors are encouraged to capitalize on this opportunity to pick up shares at a discount and benefit as Atlassian continues to grow at scale."
4115067,103480,2017-10-20T12:10:28-04:00,"Atlassian reported Q1 revenue of $194 million, up 42% y/y (an acceleration over the prior quarter's 37% growth) and smashing analyst estimates.The company also meaningfully raised its FY18 revenue and free cash flow guidance, in true beat-and-raise fashion.Enthusiasm for the company's results sent shares skyrocketing in postmarked trading, catapulting shares to $45.Though the company's results are commendable, the company now trades above 11x EV/FTM revenues, which is an expensive multiple that invites profit-taking from even the most hardy bulls.Investors are encouraged to lock in gains on the Q1 news.","Since I first wrote about Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) last month, the company has released exciting new product (Stride, a videoconferencing app to rival Slack) and posted stellar Q1 results, and renewed investor enthusiasm for the stock has pushed the Australian-based software company's stock up ~20% to fresh all-time highs. Including Atlassian's post-Q1 rally, the stock is up more than 80% YTD, rewarding investors for putting confidence in the company's bold vision for re-imagining corporate collaboration with intuitive, user-friendly products that encourage productivity and communication among team members.TEAM data by YChartsQ1 was an affirmation of the company's building momentum, with revenue growth of 42% y/y accelerating over Q4's revenue growth of 37% - and a nice surprise as well, due to the summer months generally being slower for software deals. Operating income and free cash flow showed sustained improvement as well, with FCF of $65.2 million up 140% y/y.Rare is the company that can deliver accelerated revenue growth while also growing, not just maintaining, cash flow profitability. The postmarket rally is not without its merits.While it's almost certain that Wall Street's cheerleaders will pay lip service to Atlassian's performance and raise their price targets (six of Atlassian's ten covering analysts rate it as a Buy, with the remaining as Hold ratings and no Sell ratings; the consensus price target of $43 is now outdated), I believe now is a good time to take profits off the table and return to the sidelines on Atlassian.Even after a strong quarter, raised guidance, and a successful product launch, valuation has its limits, and those who trade without heeding it are often burned. $42 was my previous marker for the stock, and now that Atlassian has well exceeded it, I would prefer to remain cautious. With a $10.4 billion market cap, the company now trades at ~11.5x EV/FY18 revenues (based on management's updated guidance), which exceeds even the valuation of Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), long the reigning king of expensive software stocks. It's not that there's any particular danger in the stock at these levels - Workday has long sustained double-digit multiples - but I fear there just isn't much upside worth the risk. Stay on the sidelines and wait for a better entry point.Let's dive into the numbers to see what's causing the Atlassian frenzy in the first place. For Q1, Atlassian reported $193.8 million, up +42% y/y. Some context around this impressive figure:See the company's revenue breakdown in the chart below, taken from the Q1 press release:Figure 1. Atlassian Q1 revenue resultsThough the company hasn't disclosed how much new products contributed to the top line, it's almost certain that the company has landed some deployments of Stride within its existing customer base, increasing its dollar-based retention rate and the overall ARR value of its subscriber base. Q1 was also likely helped by the fact that Atlassian hosted its annual user conference, Atlassian Summit, during the summer.Recall that Atlassian employs no direct salesforce, very unlike the majority of its enterprise software peers. Atlassian relies on old-fashioned pull marketing, word of mouth, and evangelical summits such as its user conference to gain users, so events like these will have a much greater impact on a no-salesforce company like Atlassian than one that employs hungry dealmakers to chase after prospects.Costs jumped in Q1 - both R&D and marketing expenses rose, the Stride rollout most likely accounting for the former and Atlassian Summit expenses for the latter. Still, the company's pro forma EPS of $0.12 (adjusting for stock-based comp) still edged out over consensus of $0.09.Despite the company's IFRS-basis net loss, the company is still generating strong cash flow. OCF of $65.2 million rose more than 2x over the prior year's first quarter OCF of only $28.4 million. Like most other software businesses, Atlassian's capex spend is light ($2.6 million in Q1), pointing to free cash flow of $62.7 million (+140% y/y). We also note that this figure, if annualized evenly over four quarters, results in an FCF run rate of $250.8 million, right in-line with the company's FY18 FCF guidance of $250-$260 million. With Q1 being this strong, and three more quarters of growth ahead, actual FCF results are likely to land much higher.On the subject of guidance: Atlassian has raised its FY18 revenue guidance to $841-$847 million, implying +37% y/y growth at the midpoint of its range. This is meaningfully increased over its initial FY18 guidance range of $826-$834 million, or +34% y/y.FCF guidance also increased by $20 million (a 10% bump) on both ends, up to $250-$260 million as previously discussed, up from a prior range of $230-$240 million. The midpoint of this range represents 39% y/y growth over Atlassian's FY17 FCF of $183.3 million.The $255 million FCF midpoint also implies that Atlassian now trades at a somewhat-passable EV/FY18 FCF valuation of 38.2x, but as most investors still view this as too expensive, we'll turn to a standard revenue valuation next.With shares rocketing near $45 in postmarket trading, Atlassian has overnight become one of the most expensive stocks in enterprise software, trading at ~11.5x EV/FY18 revenues. This calculation is based on:If adjusting for forward 12 months revenues (extrapolating Atlassian's growth into 1Q19) to construct an EV/FTM revenues multiple, Atlassian trades at approximately ~10.5x, as shown below.TEAM EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe company has marched into the highest echelon of software valuations, as seen in the chart above. The chart also reveals that the ~10-11x multiple range is a tough ceiling to crack, and even Workday has struggled to push its valuation above that range.Also, note that Atlassian is still yet to become profitable on a GAAP basis, so generalist investors who are unaccustomed to tech-style valuations will look at the lack of earnings and fail to find cause for its valuation. With technology investors generally viewing a double-digit revenue multiple as expensive and generalist investors bemoaning the lack of profits, I believe the stock's opportunities at the ~$45 level are limited.Investors have much to celebrate after Atlassian's meteoric Q1 performance, but it we take history as our guide, software stocks rarely have much cause to break past low double-digit revenue multiples. With the stock having returned more than 80% year to date and touching new all-time highs, it's a good time to take profits off the table.Atlassian is beginning to enter the cusp of having valuation support in free cash flow, as a ~38x FCF multiple, coupled with 40% growth, represents the upper end of fair value. Depending on Atlassian's next few quarters of free cash flow results and FCF guidance updates, I may consider entering a position based on an FCF valuation in the low 30s or high 20s, but not before then. For investors who are conscious of valuation, Atlassian's recent rally has made the stock a bit harder to digest.Nevertheless, the company remains a solid, entrenched technology vendor and well poised to capture more of the collaboration software market, and its recent product launches and success with its no-salesforce business model is a testament to the company's high quality. Any quick pullbacks on the order of ~5-8% or more should be considered buying opportunities."
4052691,102628,2017-03-07T12:01:48-05:00,"This is a ""Deep Dive"" research report highlighting a key secular trend within the software sector and the underpinnings of our investment theses on Atlassian and New Relic.The ADLM and APM software segments are transforming from ""nice-to-have tools used by IT for IT"" into mission-critical systems used by managers inside and outside of IT - including the C-suite, increasingly.ADLM and APM's rise is an outgrowth of a modern-day gold rush in which software is increasingly becoming *the means* of production, and no longer is just a supplemental tool.ADLM and APM are still considered mundane, niche-bound segments, leading to dramatic undervaluation - particularly for the top players.Atlassian and New Relic, innovation leaders in the ADLM and APM segments (respectively), are two of our highest-conviction stocks as a result of this trend.","Contributing Authors: John Freeman, Fred McClimans, Zach MitchellINVESTMENT CONCLUSIONWe believe Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) and New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), both innovation leaders and share-takers in their respective software market segments of Application Development Lifecycle Management (ADLM - $1.7B in total 2015 segment revenues) and Application Performance Monitoring (APM - $2.7B in total 2015 segment revenues), hold the long-term potential to become much larger companies than many analysts/PMs believe. The size and value of the APM opportunity, as well as the lack of established competitors in the space, also led us to list NEWR as one of our top tech M&A picks for 2017.APM and ADLM have existed for decades in various guises under the broader ""Development Tools"" and ""IT Operations Software"" labels, which are considered relatively mundane, niche-bounded areas of software, tactically purchased only by large enterprises during short-lived, once-an-era upgrade cycles.In our view, this reputation no longer fits; software products within the APM and ADLM segments are transforming from ""nice-to-have tools used by IT for IT"" to ""strategic systems critical to the entire business"", resulting in structurally higher growth for both segments over the next decade.In fact, APM's and ADLM's metamorphosis can be seen parts of a grander theme including any software that operates on, manages, monitors, analyzes, secures, and/or helps build other software. We are calling this more comprehensive theme, ""Software About the Software"" (shorthand = SWreSW), which is not a market segment per se but more of a descriptive overlay across established market definitions.There are two powerful drivers behind the SWreSW theme generally and the accelerating growth of APM and ADLM specifically:There are other existing, emerging and embryonic market segments one could describe, to varying degrees, as SWreSW, and we will be covering many of these in future reports. We are initially focusing on ADLM and APM for two reasons:Not only are TEAM and NEWR pure-play beneficiaries from the accelerating growth of ADLM and APM, they also: 1) possess strong fundamentals and superior management teams; 2) hold the potential to expand into other emerging SWreSW-related segments; and 3) are even attractively valued relative to our EPS growth projections.We believe CA (NASDAQ:CA) and Pega Systems (NASDAQ:PEGA) are also beneficiaries of this theme with well-positioned products in both APM and ADLM, although both face some headwinds from declining legacy products.Lastly, we would like to call attention to Dynatrace, a private IPO candidate in the APM space, as well as AppDynamics (NASDAQ:CSCO), acquired by Cisco in January for $3.7B.THEME EXPLANATIONIn this report, we will try to explain one of our favorite long-term themes that appears to have remained under the radar for many analysts and portfolio managers. Before diving in, we would like to apologize in advance. When talking about software, especially enterprise software, one often is forced to use vague terminology, layered abstractions, physical world analogies and even full-blown allegories that, even at best, only describe a portion of the ""software reality"", before falling apart and potentially leaving the reader with a more confused and flawed view than before.And, so, for lack of a better term, we are calling this theme ""Software About the Software"" (shorthand = SWreSW), which is not a specific market per se; it is more of a descriptive overlay on the classically defined market/category/segment/sub-segment hierarchy.SWreSW refers to any software that primarily operates on, manages, monitors, analyzes, secures, and/or helps build other software. There are a number of existing, emerging, and embryonic market segments one could describe as SWreSW to varying degrees, many of which will be covered in future reports.However, there are two entire segments that, today, fall unequivocally under the ""SWreSW"" label:At present, TEAM and NEWR (primarily) and CA and PEGA (secondarily) represent our investment conclusions from the SWreSW theme, and all of these companies fall squarely within the APM and ADLM segments.What Appears to be Conventional Wisdom?Among the reasons why we like this overall SWreSW theme generally and the accelerating growth of the APM and ADLM specifically, is the perception that they are mundane, niche bounded areas of software with limited long-term growth prospects.APM and ADLM segments are classified under the broader market categories of IT Operations Software and Application Development Tools, respectively, which just do not seem like the sexiest, most innovative areas of enterprise software. Historically, this perception has held true. Most segments within these categories have not grown as fast as enterprise software overall, the growth of which has been driven primarily by applications.In the '80s and '90s, desktop productivity suites, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Human Capital Management (HCM) applications drove much of the growth. During the 2000s, applications associated with topline growth took center stage - e.g., Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Business Intelligence (BI), and various types of software facilitating e-commerce and digital marketing campaigns.Beyond perception, there were, until recently, a number of good reasons for the lagging growth of segments within the categories of IT Operations Software and Application Development Tools:How We Think Our View Differs From Conventional WisdomIn our view, all of these reasons for the lagging growth of SWreSW generally and APM and ADLM specifically are fading fast. The perception no longer fits the reality. APM and ADLM software products are transforming right now from ""nice-to-have tools used by IT for IT"" to ""strategic systems critical to the entire business"", resulting in structurally higher growth for both segments over the next decade.Revenue in the $1.7B ADLM segment grew 13 percent in 2015, accelerating from 9 percent growth in 2014 and 5 percent in 2013. Similarly, revenue in the $2.7B APM segment grew 19 percent in 2015, accelerating from 17 percent in 2014 and 13 percent in 2013. We believe that revenue growth for these segments will continue to accelerate over the next three years to 14 percent to 15 percent for ADLM and 21 percent to 23 percent for APM.We believe that this growth does not represent a cyclical ""upgrade spending spike"" typical of this kind of software in the past. Rather, these segments will maintain structurally higher growth rates than they have historically well into the mid-2020s.The Logic Behind Our ViewWe see two powerful drivers behind our growth outlooks for APM and ADLM.The first is a paradigm shift, just now underway, from the Web-based application architecture to the fifth major era of enterprise computing most commonly called the MSA (Micro-Services Architecture).The second, more profound and longer lasting driver is a major shift in the role software plays in the enterprise from being a tool that helps manage the means of production to actually becoming the means of production, substituting for some combination of human labor and dumb machines.The Web-based Application Architecture Migrating To MSAThe migration to MSA is still in the ""visionary"" phase of the Geoffrey Moore's famous ""Crossing the Chasm"" adoption curve, with probably less than 10 percent of enterprises having deployed MSA-based applications at scale. However, several high-profile enterprises have deployed MSA very successfully at massive scale, including Amazon, Netflix, and Uber.We believe MSA will cross the chasm be adopted rapidly as it extends several advantages, including much faster application development and deployment and the potential for almost on-the-fly integration with other MSA-based applications internal and even external to the enterprise (e.g., customers, suppliers, partners).It is also fundamentally a much more scalable architecture, and it can scale up very rapidly, which is critical these days when some new customer-facing app can ""go viral"" and the number of concurrent users can explode from 5k to 5M in a matter of days. To get a better understanding of this architectural migration, a little historical perspective might be helpful.Despite the continuous talk in the industry over the years about increasing software integration and the value of offering enterprises entire suites of software, each stage in the history of enterprise software is about breaking code up into increasingly smaller chunks and establishing standards that enable those chunks to operate together with increasing seamlessness and flexibility.In the mainframe era, applications were singular, monolithic pieces of software centralized in a single location. The client-server architecture split the code in two, with data and some of the application logic being centralized on a server and some executed locally on a PC. In the mid-1990s, software called middleware appeared on the scene to link multiple, heretofore independent client-server applications via various message-passing protocols.During the early-2000s, client-server started to give way to what can be generally referred to as the Web-based architecture, a change that is still taking place among more conservative technology adopters. Simply explained, the Web-based architecture divided up the server side of the client-server architecture into multiple, discrete ""tiers"", each running on a separate server or cluster of severs. It also replaced the client side application with a standard Web browser that could be used to access any application that an enterprise has moved to a Web-based architecture.By standardizing access with the ubiquitous browser, Web-based computing eliminated the need for applications to run natively on a specific client-side operating system. This turned out to be a critical catalyst for the take-off of SaaS and cloud computing from 2005 to 2010 and was a key initial step in making enterprise applications accessible from smartphones and tablets.Even as enterprises were adopting the Web-based model, new standards were developed and added in order to speed up application development time and enable rapid feature release without putting the entire application, or worse, multiple dependent applications, at risk.These standards, falling under the label, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), further divided and partitioned applications into discrete, self-contained chunks that executed a particular set of operations defined as a ""service"". Operating together, these services can replicate the functionality of a more monolithic application but would be much more flexible, dynamic, and resilient.Some enterprises deployed SOA to some degree but, for a number of reasons that are outside the scope of this report, the SOA architecture was not widely adopted. However, SOA did lay the foundation for MSA, which was adopted earliest by enterprises where, as one might guess, software was the means of production.Some argue that MSA represents a finer grained version of SOA or that MSA is simply ""SOA done right"". There is probably truth in both of those statements, but rather than get bogged down in the abstractions and the nested taxonomies required to discuss software architectures, we would simply like to state the following: unlike its technologically justified predecessor SOA, MSA, in our opinion, has clearly demonstrated its business value and that is why we believe it will be adopted rapidly.However, as is the case with every major change in computing, MSA creates a new set of challenges in terms of developing, debugging, updating, deploying, and, overall, managing applications.With MSA, each micro-service can use different technologies inside its own ""instance"", can be written in a different languages each optimized for the workload the micro-service performs, can access multiple databases with differing data structures, are distributed across a larger number of servers that may be on-premises, in a customer's data center, or in a SaaS/PaaS/IaaS provider's data center, and may even move from server to server in order to quickly scale both up or down or recover from hardware failure or a software bug.These are among MSA's advantages, but, obviously, this heterogeneity often requires using multiple legacy tools for development, monitoring, management, security, etc. Of course, generally, those tools often do not, themselves, scale particularly well or play well together.To make matters more complex, as the number of micro-services grows in a production environment, so do the dependencies among them, creating an increasingly complex ""mesh"" of software instances.For starters, this really changes the way software is developed, requiring a much higher degree of automation, documentation, and tracking that is close to impossible for human programmers to handle without help from, well, more software. It also makes performance optimization and troubleshooting not only substantially more difficult in terms of sheer scale but also different in kind, as monitoring agents need to be, more or less, as atomized and distributed as the micro-services they are monitoring.These challenges materialize at every stage of the application lifecycle - from scope/spec definition all the way through maintenance and version management.They are also different in scale and character from those ever encountered during the two previous (still contemporaneous) eras: client-server and Web-based applications. Therefore, not only will MSA adoption crank up overall demand in APM, ADLM, and other SWreSW segments, it will create opportunities for a whole new generation of products and vendors because most legacy products will be useless in solving the emerging challenges of the MSA paradigm.Further, these tools will not be just for large enterprises as has primarily been the case in the past. Even small companies that are increasingly using IT and software as a strategic, competitive advantage (and those that are not doing so will increasingly be put out of business) and are adopting a MSA can no longer view these tools (e.g., application lifecycle management, automated code testing, application performance monitoring, among others) as luxuries.Employing these tools will be table stakes. As an aside, this need for a different approach hampers legacy vendors in the IT Operations and Application Development categories and represents an additional point of conviction regarding our primary investment conclusions, TEAM and NEWR.So, if all that is occurring is a change in architecture, even if it's a major change, we would expect revenue growth in these segments to surge for a few years only to then fade as adoption of the new architecture moves into the late majority and laggards at the backend of the adoption curve. Historically, changes in application architecture have produced spending spikes in the tools used to develop, manage, and secure applications. However, enterprises typically view investment in these areas more tactically, simply the cost of upgrading the infrastructure of the IT department.At present, we are certainly seeing a spending spike in ADLM, APM, and other SWreSW segments. However, we also believe that the growth in demand for ADLM and APM is actually more structural and of much longer duration, with these segments moving from line items in the IT infrastructure and operations budget to being business-critical tools for the entire C-suite, not just the CIO or CTO.That brings us to our second driver, software's changing role.Software's Changing Role Is Changing the Nature of Business ItselfThe second and more powerful SWreSW driver was summed up by Netscape founder and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen in his 2011 WSJ op. ed. where he famously declared, ""Software is eating the world."" His point, with which we very much agree, is that software, fueled ultimately by Moore's Law's biennial one hundred percent transistor surplus, is disrupting, disintermediating, and fundamentally transforming traditional industries one by one.Traditionally, the primary role of enterprise software was to assist humans in managing the means of production. Today, increasingly, software IS the means of production. The difference is not semantic; it is profound and critical to understanding how tech, software specifically, will continue to invade and transform non-tech industries, just as Amazon has done in retail, Apple/iTunes did to the music industry, Priceline and Expedia have done to travel agencies, and Uber is doing to taxis.Pick up any business magazine now and there are multiple articles referring to this trend and they are not targeted at techies. Tech, software in particular, is no longer for techies and programmers; it is for anyone running a business.Over the last fifty years, enterprise software has proven increasingly effective in helping humans manage the means of production, which has primarily consisted of two elements, other humans and dumb machines. Most of the enterprise software market revenue and most of the C-suite attention has gone to the applications, with the well-known categories of ERP, CRM, HCM, SCM, BI, and desktop productivity suites taking the bulk of both the revenue and attention.Still, not long after software began to be used to help run businesses in 1960s, several new types of ""software about the software"" emerged that helped in creating, managing, and securing the software being used to run the business.However, these SWreSW market segments, such as APM and ADLM, were still two steps removed from the means of production. Therefore, they remained confined to niche markets with none of the open-ended upside of the aforementioned applications that they were helping to create, manage, and secure.We believe that the status and role of SWreSW changes substantially as software itself becomes the third element of the means of production, with segments like APM and ADLM moving into a position only one step removed from the means of production. Hence, it stands to reason that they should become just as important as those applications like ERP and CRM that were used to help manage the incumbent elements in the means of production, humans and dumb machines.If that seems a little far-fetched at this point, consider this: SWreSW segments like APM and ADLM will not only be helpful in managing the software element of the means of production in the same fashion as ERP and CRM have in the past with humans and dumb machines, they are absolutely required to do so.Unlike humans and machines, software can operate on a vastly larger scale, at much greater speeds, and, to the degree that it is allowed, autonomously. Any element of the means of production that can affect that much that fast all by itself is going to need an equally powerful entity to prevent disaster, optimize performance, and make sure everything goes as close to plan as possible. That entity cannot be humans alone. Lots of new software will be required, ""software about the software"", to be exact.Our premise is that, if there is an outage in the software that helps humans manage a purely human-plus-machine means of production, the business can still ""go manual"" and continue operations, albeit more slowly and inefficiently.Hypotheticals could include:The reality is that even if one of the most so-called ""mission critical software systems that must never move off of a mainframe"" (quotation marks added for sarcastic emphasis), that is, the ticketing system for airlines, goes down, every airline has procedures for taking, tracking, and billing ticket sales using a pen and paper.In contrast, if Uber's software goes down, its business stops cold.There is no ""man config mode"" for Uber, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), LinkedIn (NASDAQ:MSFT), Priceline (PCLN), AirBnB, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and numerous other companies where software is the primary means of production.It is no surprise to us that these companies and many more that also employ software as the means of production are large consumers of ADLM and APM software, including products from TEAM and NEWR.Amazon, ever-the-trail-blaziest adopter of new technology, actually developed its own APM software for its own use years ago because the company felt that:While companies like these that feature software as their primary means of production represent the ideal market for SWreSW, they do, at this point, still represent a small portion of enterprises. Nevertheless, these companies are laying the foundation and setting the example.The lessons they are learning about how to employ software as a means of production will make their way over the next few years into a set of ""best practices"". They will become the ""trade secrets"" possessed by executives hired away from the innovative new companies by more established companies trying to infuse some software into their means of production. Then, these best practices become the repeatable template sold to these same established companies by management consulting firms brought in by the new executive who needs third party validation to get buy-in from the rest of the C-suite.It will not be long before the lessons learned in the process of injecting software directly into the means of production make up the curriculum of the leading business schools.We believe that chief among these best practices is heavy investment these companies have made in SWreSW, especially in ADLM and APM software.Again, the investment in and daily usage of SWreSW will not be a best practice for the IT department. It will be a best practice for all managers and executives. When a good CEO really wants to check on the health of the business, she goes down to the factory floor or to a sales meeting or to R&D brainstorming session and talks to the employees and listens to them. How do you do that when your employee is software? You need an entity that can speak the same language. You need ""software about the software"".The point is, when humans and machines were the essential elements of the means of production, software was brought in to increase efficiency but was not, strictly speaking, required to maintain operations. In contrast, when software serves as any portion of the means of production, SWreSW, is required to a much greater degree.When software becomes an element in the means of production, enterprises require much more powerful SWreSW products generally and APM and ADLM products specifically. So, we believe that the market for SWreSW will expand substantially in the three critical dimensions:REFERENCED COMPANIESBottom Line: Software is disrupting, disintermediating, and fundamentally transforming industries one by one. Enterprise software in particular is undergoing a dramatic change, as it is increasingly becoming the means of production, rather than serving merely as a supplemental tool that assists humans in managing the means of production. The difference is not semantic. As an example, at companies like Uber, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, Priceline, AirBnB, Netflix, etc., software is the business, and if there is a software outage, the entire business stops cold.APM and ADLM software tools are consequently transforming into mission-critical systems - not the niche-bound, only-the-IT-department-cares afterthoughts that they have been historically and are still largely considered by investors. We believe that revenue growth for these segments will continue to accelerate over the next three years to 14 percent to 15 percent for ADLM and 21 percent to 23 percent for APM, and will remain at structurally higher growth rates well into the mid-2020s.NEWR and TEAM - APM and ADLM innovation leaders, respectively - are two of our highest-conviction stocks as a result of this trend and because of their strong management teams and business models. We look forward to writing about both in more detail as they continue to develop tools that help software eat the world.________Don't miss an alert or update.

It reported revenue of $193.8 million, up 42%. Net loss widened to $14 million or $0.06 per share from $2.6 million or $0.01 per share a year ago. Non IFRS net income increased to $29.9 million or $0.12 per share from $22.7 million or $0.10 per share last year. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $0.09 per share on revenue of $185.8 million.By segment, revenues from subscription rose 69% to $84.4 million, maintenance grew 24% to $76.3 million, perpetual license increased 14% to $19.9 million, and other revenues 74% grew to $13.2 million.Atlassian ended the first quarter of fiscal 2018 with a total customer count of 107,746, up 64%. It added 4,246 net new customers in the quarter. The customer count benefited from a one-time increase of 14,263 customers primarily due to Bitbucket Cloud pricing changes made in May 2017, as Atlassian moved from a tiered pricing model to per-user pricing. It ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $613.5 million.For the second quarter, Atlassian expects revenue to be in the range of $203 million to $205 million. Net loss per diluted share is expected to be approximately ($0.08) on an IFRS basis, and net income per diluted share is expected to be approximately of $0.12 on a non-IFRS basis. Analysts expect earnings of $0.42 to $0.44 per share on revenue of $831 million.For fiscal year 2017, Atlassian had reported annual revenues of $619.9 million, up 36%. Net loss was $42.5 million or $0.19 per share compared with net income of $4.3 million or $0.02 per share in 2016.For fiscal year 2018, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $841 million to $847 million. Net loss per diluted share is expected to be in the range of ($0.35) to ($0.34) on an IFRS basis, and net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.47 on a non-IFRS basis.Atlassian introduced its newest team communication solution called Stride. Stride is a cloud-based offering that brings together team messaging, audio and video conferencing, and collaboration tools. With this offering, it takes on rivals Slack (SLACK) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in workplace collaboration that are also competitors for its workplace chat platform HipChat.In February this year, Atlassian acquired cloud-based team collaboration software maker Trello for $425 million. Trello is expected to have strengthened Atlassian's capabilities in handling clients across business teams in legal, HR, finance, marketing and sales. Trello had over 19 million users and is expected to bring in 13,000 paid customers on a net basis. With this acquisition, Atlassian takes on Microsoft and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).Its stock is currently trading at $50.17 with a market cap of $11.46 billion. It hit a 52-week low of $23.8 in December last year and hit a 52-week high of $50.88 following its recent first quarter results.This is a rock solid company, always focused on fundamentals!"

        It also launched a new videoconferencing app called Stride, its first new product since IPO
        Stride rounds out Atlassian’s portfolio in collaboration apps and gives it more weapons in its toolkit against the likes of Slack and Microsoft
        Shares jumped 8% following investor day and the product launch announcement","There’s a lot of news coming out of Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM) this week, but most importantly for bulls, the stock snapped back up - and in a big way. The market is responding brightly to the direction Atlassian is taking.We’ll get into the details in this article, but the key takeaways for investors: Atlassian remains a hyper-growth cloud company, and with its entry into videoconferencing, Atlassian’s team communications platform (originally consisting of just Hipchat, a simpler messaging app) becomes much more broad and appealing. With Stride, Atlassian’s growth engine remains firmly intact, and the hype around a new product could even cause an acceleration in top-line growth.Atlassian made several announcements and updates in its Investor Day that are pertinent to investors, and I've gathered the most critical of them here:The first is that Atlassian is re-committing to its sales model, which as I noted in my previous article, is unique in enterprise software: no direct salespeople. The company will focus on organic growth via ""demand pull"" events such as conferences and web advertising, as well as word-of-mouth. Atlassian reported that its three websites (bitbucket.com, atlassian.com, and trello.com) - generate 2.4, 2.0, and 5.9 million unique monthly visitors. A typical day for the company will generate $2.8 million in sales (which annualizes to more than $1 billion), primarily from these direct channel visitors.Alongside the direct channel sales model, Atlassian is putting renewed focus on its partner program. Partners are a critical part of demand generation for software companies, as they proselytize the company's products and generate revenue ""for free."" The below chart shows an update on Atlassian's current roster of worldwide partners and resellers, and how much of a proportion they are to Atlassian's revenues:Figure 1. Atlassian partner count and channel mixSource: Investor day handoutPlatinum partners are those that initiate deployments in excess of $250,000. Also note that Atlassian (based in Sydney, Australia with major operations in EMEA) - still has plenty of room for growth in the critical U.S. market. Due to Atlassian's heavy use of partners and lack of an internal sales force, it has achieved stellar sales and marketing efficiency (defined as sales spending as a percentage of revenues) relative to its peers, who pay for ads in addition to large sales headcount. The below chart from Atlassian's investor day presentation shows its sales efficiency relative to other cloud peers:Figure 2. Atlassian sales efficiency vs. operating compsSource: Investor day handoutThe company also reiterated its goal to aim for $1 billion in revenues, while maintaining predictable and growing revenues quarter to quarter. The company reiterated its FY18 revenue goal of $830 million, unchanged from its prior quarter guidance range of $826-$834 million.$830 million in FY18 revenues implies 35% y/y growth, which is impressive for a company that is also generating a 32% OCF margin, whereas the majority of its high-growth peers in the >30% bucket generate negative OCF. Recall that Atlassian ends its fiscal year in June, so this revenue guidance also represents FTM expected revenues.As seen in the chart below, Atlassian's revenues are expected to grow at 41% CAGR through FY18:Figure 3. Atlassian revenueSource: Investor day handoutOther financial updates presented in the investor day include:On September 7, Atlassian also launched its newest product, Stride - a videoconferencing and messaging app intended to take on Slack, its primary competitor in the workplace collaboration space. Stride is Atlassian's first organic product launch since its IPO, and the launch has been met with some degree of hype - the launch has been covered by TechCrunch, Bloomberg, and Forbes.Stride users can start off with a free version that comes with 25,000 messages and 5GB of storage, but premium access comes at virtually nothing - $3/user/month. For comparison, Slack charges $6.67/user/month for a ""Standard"" subscription and $12.50 for an upgraded ""Plus"" membership.Stride is priced lower than Atlassian's other products (JIRA modules typically cost between $7-$10 per user, per month depending on the size of the deployment; Confluence is $5), but since messaging tools typically get deployed by entire departments or companies (rather than one-off teams, like JIRA), Stride could have a much larger impact on Atlassian's top line than you'd initially think. Slack, in particular, has had tremendous success winning large deployments in entire organizations.The below screenshot from Stride's marketing site shows how the app UI looks. With a single click, Stride enables conversations to transition seamlessly to voice and video calls, enabling quick and comfortable communication with team members:Figure 4. Stride demo from marketing websiteFile sharing, search functionality, and group screen sharing are all natively embedded into the application.Below is how Atlassian envisions Stride fitting into its existing product portfolio:Figure 5. Atlassian product portfolio, September 2017Source: Investor day handoutStride presents a fuller messaging and collaboration platform with fleshed out features to complement JIRA, which is primarily intended for workflow planning and organization. HipChat, which was Atlassian's original collaboration offering (at $2/user/month) with limited functionalities, will still continue to be supported, but eventually will be folded into the new flagship Stride product. With Stride, Atlassian is much better positioned to compete with the feature-rich, customer-favorite Slack. With Slack-like features at better pricing, Atlassian has an opportunity to make a large dent in the market. For perspective on how big of an impact the Stride product could have on Atlassian's revenue, Recode reported that Slack was projecting ~$1 billion in revenues next year, though this estimate is unconfirmed.If Atlassian is able to gather an equivalent customer base to Slack's (albeit over time), it could stand to double its revenues from where it is today. Note also that the collaboration software market isn't a zero-sum pie, either - a win for Atlassian doesn't necessarily mean a deal lost for Slack - as many purchasers of Slack are new to the tool. Greenfield opportunities are many for Stride, as well as possible market share grab from existing installed customers.Investors should gather two main takeaways from this week's batch of Atlassian news:The market liked what Atlassian had to say, and shares were up 8% following its investor day, closing at $36.58. This implies an EV/FTM revenue multiple of 9.4x - not cheap, by any means, but I believe an exciting new product launch and energized growth targets facilitate an easy path for the company to move toward $42, or 11x forward revenues (roughly in-line with Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY), another software favorite)."

        Trello makes a collaboration software for individuals and small teams in the SMB space.
        Atlassian views the deal as complementary to its market focus and as a fit between its JIRA and Confluence products.
        While not cheap, the deal promises to be a strategic win for Atlassian over the medium term.","Quick TakeTeam productivity software company Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) has announced an agreement to acquire collaboration software developer Trello for $425 million in cash and stock.Trello is a fast-growing developer of collaboration software for more than 19 million SMB users worldwide.Atlassian acquired the firm for its complementary user base and service that will fill a space between its flagship JIRA and Confluence products.Target CompanyNew York-based Trello was founded in 2011 by CEO Michael Pryor and Joel Spolsky, who is now CEO of Stack Overflow.The company created a free app and web service that enables users to work in a more productive way through its boards, lists, and cards while avoiding email thread workflows.The product had three pricing versions: free, business at $9.99 per user/month and an enterprise version quoted individually.Below is a brief demo video about using Trello:(Source: Trello YouTube)Trello also developed an API that enables developers to utilize the data captured and create their own versions of the service.Major investors included Spark Capital, Index Ventures and BoxGroup, who invested a total of $10.3 million for approximately 22% of the company, according to Fortune's Term Sheet.If true, the sale would represent an approximately 93.5% return on invested capital over a five and one-half year time frame for the VC firms involved.Acquisition TermsAtlassian will pay Trello's shareholders $360 million in cash and $65 million in Atlassian restricted shares.The deal is expected to close by March 31, 2017, and Trello's 100 employees will join Atlassian's 1,800-strong force.Atlassian did not announce any layoffs as a result of the combination but said it would discuss the details at its upcoming 2Q 2017 earnings call on January 19, 2017.The acquisition will be dilutive to IFRS earnings in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, with the estimates reflecting 'a reduction relating to fair value adjustments to acquired deferred revenue.'Rationale and CommentaryAtlassian is a $5.5 billion market cap team collaboration software company that is spending almost 8% of its capitalization on Trello.This acquisition is a major one for Atlassian, but not transformational.Trello has grown dramatically in the past few years, with more than 19 million registered users in more than 100 countries, mostly among the SMB market segment that is complementary to Atlassian's trifecta of JIRA, Confluence and HipChat project tracking, content and communication products.It's not known how much revenue Trello was generating from its user base, but if 2% of users were paying $10 per month, that would translate into $45 million per year in topline revenues.Given Trello's very strong user base growth rate, it's conceivable that Atlassian paid up to 10x revenues for the deal.Strategically, according to Barb Darrow's Fortune interview with Atlassian President Jay Simons, he sees Trello 'fitting in between Atlassian's existing Confluence software and JIRA.'Additionally, 'Atlassian plans to launch a new version of the Trello integration alongside its HipChat group chat product and will provide new links between Trello and its other products as well.'So, while there may be some overlap between products, Atlassian appears to be acquiring Trello for its fast-growing, global user base to which it intends to cross sell (in both directions).Assuming that complementarity exists, the deal should be a strategic fit, although Atlassian is not getting it on the cheap.Atlassian's stock is up 1% on the announcement, so it seems the larger market views the deal as a good one, despite its expected hit to earnings in 2017 and 2018.I write about IPOs, follow-ons, secondaries, and M&A.

How many times have you gotten an email with ""Document_version4point0.doc"" attached? Or wondered who re-worded that section you wrote? Or gotten confused trying to incorporate the feedback from a dozen people in the meeting into your spreadsheet? Or gone digging around Sharepoint to try to find that spec document from three years ago?Teams are a crucial aspect of completing business projects, and while Office was (and is) a great personal productivity tool, it falls down when trying to meet the needs of teams.And that's where today's stock comes in.Its mission statement?""Our goal is to do for team productivity what Microsoft Office has done for personal productivity.""That sounds like an interesting opportunity. Let's take a look at Quality Growth Spell stock Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM).Atlassian makes enterprise software that is focused on helping product and project teams work together more efficiently. The company sells 6 products at present:1) JIRA: A project-management tool that lets teams track tasks, issues, problem reports, enhancement requests, and so forth. In a nutshell, it tracks ""tickets"" of work, allowing the implementors to estimate and log time against tickets while allowing managers to easily track progress of anything from huge scope projects at a high level to individual bug reports. JIRA was Atlassian's first product and remains its largest revenue generator.2) Confluence: Remember how we mentioned the old ""Document_version4point0.doc"" above? Well Confluence is a document management platform that eliminates the need for that. It allows all project based documents to be centrally placed and tracked so that the team can make and track changes - and, of course, find the documents in the first place! Confluence is Atlassian's second largest product.3) HipChat: Anyone familiar with Slack will understand HipChat immediately as it is basically a direct competitor. HipChat is a messaging platform, not too unlike Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), but organized around business topics or projects.4) Bitbucket: Bitbucket is an enterprise source code management system based around Git. It offers a nice front end for Git, advanced code deployment models, hosted repositories (similar to GitHub), and cross-functionality with other Atlassian software.5) JIRA Service Desk: An IT support and customer service system. While similar to a lot of other offerings from BMC and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), the real winner here is how JIRA Service Desk integrates right into a JIRA ticket tracking instance, creating a smooth work flow for getting problems resolved.6) StatusPage: A recent product that was purchased by Atlassian. StatusPage is a product designed to report (both internally and externally) on the health and status of the wide variety of systems and services that comprise modern IT product offerings.Atlassian sells its products in two ways. There is the classic ""perpetual"" sales model, where it charges up-front for a perpetual license to offer its software to the customer to install and manage on their own IT network, paying a recurring maintenance fee for support and updates. This model made up 62% of Atlassian's fiscal 2016 sales, growing 31% over the previous year.The second sales model is ""cloud"" where Atlassian hosts and manages the software instance on their own servers and charges a recurring subscription access fee. Cloud was 32% of 2016 sales, but is growing at a much faster 71% rate. Management sees the cloud model as being the predominant revenue driver within a few years.Let's also not forget the ""other"" revenue category. Atlassian's software is very modular and built to be expandable through third-party modules and plugins. The company even offers a marketplace for these plugins, fittingly called the Atlassian Marketplace. Of course, the firm takes a cut of all plugin sales, which in 2016 amounted to about 6% of revenue.With a price-to-sales ratio exceeding 13 and an anemic free cash yield of 1.9% (Atlassian reports an operating loss for the trailing 12 months), this is no value stock by any stretch. The firm will need to continue growing revenue rapidly to live up to its current price, let alone a higher one.Fortunately, prospects look good. TEAM's three-year compound annual revenue growth is over 40%, and is expected to remain over 30% for the next few years. There is plenty of room for new customers as Atlassian services just 290 of the Fortune 500 and about 61,000 companies overall - out of a potential customer pool that management estimates at half a million or more.Cross selling also is a key part of the thesis. Atlassian may get into a company with JIRA, and as it permeates their business processes, the integration afforded by its other solutions can drive sales to Bitbucket (away from GitHub), for example, or create company demand for Confluence or JIRA Service Desk to simplify existing processes.Of course, new products are also an opportunity that we can expect management to exploit. Atlassian's R&D budget is large at almost 48% of revenues, and the company has shown the will to add by acquisition with StatusPage. The product portfolio is still in its early stages.At a $6 billion market cap, Atlassian has a large valuation but not particularly huge for the enterprise software market. Consider that Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office empire does over $25 billion in sales a year (vs. Atlassian's $460 million) and other enterprise software companies like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) ($51 billion market value) and EMC (purchased for $67 billion by Dell) have gotten quite large. Even niche IT software companies like CA (NASDAQ:CA) and Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) have market caps more than 2x Atlassian's. To put things in perspective, enterprise IT software is a $620 billion dollar market - it's enormous! There is plenty of room for Atlassian to grow.There is tough competition though. While no one company competes against all of Atlassian's offerings, its individual products face competition from huge and established players such as Microsoft , HP (NYSE:HPQ), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), as well as smaller specialized software firms like ServiceNow, Rally (NYSE:RALY) and Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN). Make no mistake: Atlassian is one of the barbarians at the big boys' gate.As for competitive advantages, I'd call it a mixed bag. Barriers to entry are low and new competitors pop up in this space all the time. On the other hand, stickiness once integrated into a company's business processes is quite good. It takes a substantial amount of time and effort to switch to and learn a critical new business tool, and managers are hesitant to change unless there is a really good reason to. As add-on modules and additional software products are integrated in, stickiness increases. The reliability of Atlassian's cash flows are better than the average firm.Valuing early-stage growth companies is more of an art than a science. The main piece of data we have to go by is revenues, so we will use the price-to-sales valuation method here.Fiscal 2016 revenues came in at $457 million, and expectations for 2017 is for about $599 million, a 31% increase. It seems reasonable to model substantial but declining growth rates going forward, steadily ramping down to just over 10% by the end of a 10-year period. That puts Atlassian at nearly $3 billion in sales in 10 years - a high bar for certain, but not inconceivable given the size of the market.Even today, Atlassian's free cash flow margin is near 25%. As the company matures, I expect operating margins to come in similar to other IT software firms - close to 30%. Using our rule of thumb, that would be a 3.0 price-to-sales multiple at 5% revenue growth. Given the stickiness of IT software and the premiums historically afforded to the sector, I would kick this ""par"" P/S ratio up to about 3.3.Now we see that, today, Atlassian is growing sales at a 30%+ clip, or about 6x a ""par"" growth rate. 6x our ""par"" P/S ratio is a rather ridiculous 19.8, but it gives you an idea of the short-term valuation potential. I'm uncomfortable with anything over a 13 P/S ratio, so let's use that. 13 times $600 million in sales gives us a one-year target market cap of about $7.8 billion. Management has already estimated their share count at 235 million, giving us a target price of $33.20. That's a modest 14% gainer from today's price of $29.But I see Atlassian as a long-term play. Certainly, the company's long-term potential is far greater than $600 million in sales, and it should deliver excellent long-term gains for patient shareholders. That said, this is a high-flying stock, and better value points may very well present themselves going forward."

The 180-day lockup period for pre-IPO shareholders has since expired.While the stock has done well since the IPO, my fair value estimate calls for a further gain to $34.00 vs. its current stock price of around $27.20, for a potential upside of 25%.The market for Atlassian's software is large and growing, putting the company in the ""sweet spot"" to take full advantage of that growth.Research firm IDC predicts the global content collaboration software market will reach $6.2 billion by 2019, a 13.4% compound annual growth rate for 2014-2019.Furthermore, the report says that most of the growth will come from vendors focused on the ""public cloud,"" vendors like Atlassian. However, on-premises growth will be nearly flat according to IDC.The competition for enterprise SMB collaboration software is fierce and varied, with competitors ranging from large industry incumbents such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) (NYSE:HPE) to smaller companies like Rally, CollabNet, Version One, Polarion and ThoughtWorks.There are numerous competitors for Atlassian's other software modules, from industry specific players to more generic, horizontal players such as Google.Atlassian's strategy is to offer an effortless ""on-ramp"" to its services, with a free trial policy. Only when users are ""enterprise"" grade do they get dedicated technical support. So, the company's sales and technical support costs are low.To provide customizability options for clients, Atlassian has created a self-serve marketplace, which it says has ""hundreds of integrations, plug-ins and add-ons"" to increase functionality and the ability to customize its software for specific use cases.It's no wonder that Atlassian has been largely profitable since its early days.From its founding in 2002, the company didn't need outside capital until July 2010, when it raised its only venture capital financing, $60 million from top-tier firm Accel Partners.With a history of rapid revenue growth and profitability, the company went public in December 2015 at an annual revenue run rate of $320 million and an 88% gross profit margin.Since the IPO, Atlassian has reported once its quarterly 6-K report. For the quarter ended March 31, 2016, it posted the following unaudited results:Revenues: $118 million, 40% QoQ growth Gross margin: 83%, down 5% vs. prior year EBITDA: Loss of $1,072,000 vs. loss of $648,000The company had $313 million in cash on hand as of March 31, 2016.Atlassian has not been EBITDA positive since becoming a public company. So, an estimated $34.00 stock price valuation is based on a 5-year growth discounted cash flow assumption and represents a potential 25% upside return.(Source: FinBox)At Atlassian's current price of $27.20, the company represents an attractive buying opportunity for the short to medium term.The 180-day share lockup period has expired without extensive insider selling; always a good sign the stock has positive investor support behind it.Analyst consensus for the current quarter loss has dropped from 7 cents per share to 6 cents per share. Annual consensus estimates have improved to break-even, from a previous 5 cents per share loss.Atlassian's next earnings announcement date is August 4, 2016.You could wait to learn more about the most recent quarter's results, but my recommendation is to consider buying the stock before then, as the report has a good chance of showing more rapid growth."
4023186,99846,2016-11-14T12:56:41-05:00,Microsoft has launched Microsoft Teams which has been labeled as a Slack killer.We fear that Atlassian and HipChat may get caught in the crossfire.This could result in Atlassian needing to ditch its word of mouth marketing model for a more traditional model.The increase in sales and marketing could ruin margins and slow growth.,"Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a software-as-a-service company with a difference. Not only is it a company that lets its product and its users do the talking, but this recipe has been a proven success. Sales have been growing at an incredible rate. In fact, the recent first quarter result saw the company report sales growth of 34.4% year on year - all without traditional marketing and instead reliant on word of mouth.Source: Atlassian's Q1 presentationAs you can see above, the number of customers has risen quarter on quarter for at least the last ten quarters. Impressively, the recent first quarter saw the largest single increase in customer numbers during that time, despite using a word of mouth approach.This unorthodox approach really caught our eye and we loved what we were seeing. So much so that we invested in the company at the start of May. Since then, the stock has rallied higher by over 15 percent. Although we feel the stock could still climb higher in the quarters ahead, we have decided to close our position in the company following the decision of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to take on Atlassian and its rival Slack (SLACK).Microsoft Teams is a new collaborative communication addition to the hugely popular Office 365 suite that looks set to heat things up in the industry, potentially bringing an end to the dominance enjoyed by both Slack and Atlassian's HipChat. Although it has a number of products, we saw HipChat as a major driver of growth for Atlassian over the next few years. The Uber (NYSE:UBER) contract win was the icing on the cake for us. We felt the fact that Uber moved its thousands of users across from Slack was a real testament to the quality of the product.But if this growth is now challenged by Microsoft, which we expect it will be, then this could create a number of problems for the company and its stock. There certainly is a lot of growth priced in at the moment, and failure to deliver on this could see a severe rerating.Perhaps, we are panicking over nothing and the word of mouth model will continue to succeed. After all, a new entrant to the market is nothing new. But perhaps, we have to view things differently when that entrant is revitalized tech giant Microsoft. Although we believe its eyes were firmly on Slack when it made this move, we expect Atlassian to be caught in the crossfire.Our biggest fear is that the increased competition from Microsoft may result in the need for Atlassian to start to ditch its successful word of mouth advertising for more traditional marketing in order to hold its market share. If it were to do this, then margins are going to be negatively impacted a great deal, resulting in lower levels of profitability, which is certainly not something you want to see with its stock trading on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 114.Sourced from Atlassian Q1 10-QUnfortunately, Atlassian does not break down its revenue any further than the table shown above. Because of this, we cannot see how reliant the company is on HipChat, but we feel it is reasonable to assume that it is the biggest driver of subscription growth.So if the company does resort to a more traditional marketing approach, we would expect to see its sales and marketing expense rise beyond 25% of revenue and perhaps even higher, slowing its earnings growth drastically. As you can see above, industry peers currently operate with far larger budgets than Atlassian.Whilst in the long term, the move to traditional marketing might in fact benefit Atlassian and result in stronger sales growth. The lower levels of profitability in the short term will undoubtedly be a real turn off for many investors and have analysts scrambling to adjust their discounted cash flow models. If this happens and the stock plunges, we would very happily revisit the company when it is priced at a more conservative multiple. But for now we wish the company well and are going to watch this battle play out from outside.As always, thanks for reading and best of luck with your investments!"
3984462,96536,2016-06-26T20:42:56-04:00,Atlassian Corporation PLC is a software-as-a-service company that recently went public.Shares of TEAM present an opportunity to invest in the agile software development trend.But are shares of TEAM worth the high price tag given their limited operating history?,"Atlassian Corporation PLC (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a software-as-a-service (NASDAQ:SAAS) company that offers a number of online collaboration and productivity tools. These software products help developer, engineers and business stakeholders collaborate and interact with each other on product development.TEAM was founded in 2002 and has since grown to $5.5B in market cap. They have 1,400 staff serving 51,000 customers across the globe. This explosive growth is one reason that I couldn't resist analyzing this fast growing young company. Plus, they only went public recently, in December 2015.But another reason I wanted to look at TEAM is because I have friends using their products in the workplace. Seemingly, every software developer I know swears by this ""agile development methodology."" It's proposed to be a faster and more efficient way to build software, compared to traditional project management techniques. With an agile approach, you iterate and ship quickly. And TEAM's suite of software is one of the key providers to serve and enable this growing trend.That said, rather than rely on anecdotal evidence alone, we can corroborate the growth of agile development pretty easily. This Google Trends graph shows the consistently growing interest in this approach to work (source). I think it's here to stay. And a lot of well-known tech companies are now ""agile,"" even large ones like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (source).But these aren't the only trends I want to look at. Although has just a few years of operating statistics, I'd like to examine their numbers since the IPO and try to understand if their financial metrics reflect the qualitative strengths of the business. Before we do that, here's a price chart of TEAM since IPO:TEAM Financial Performance Since IPO:When it comes to new companies with lots of growth potential, I always like to look at the top line first. Without top line growth, this company would be a pass. The whole investment premise is that they're enabling a new way of doing things. So by definition, we should be seeing growth as more companies embrace this more effective agile approach. Let's see if this is reflected in the top line (source):To my eye, this is a great start. The TTM numbers in particular look compelling. Now, the company doesn't explicitly state how their revenue breaks out across their product suite. But in their current report they do mention about two-thirds of revenue comes from their two most popular products, Confluence and JIRA. This does present some risk, but may be slightly mitigated by the geographic breakdown of revenue (source):In addition to the geographically diverse revenue streams, all of which are growing, I also like the SaaS business model. This is especially true when selling into a corporate setting. It's very similar to what Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is doing. The business model provides recurring revenue, and an easy up-sell. Plus, it's very easy for client organizations to get very dependent on their SaaS tools. This makes switching costs high, and revenue sticky.But revenue alone, even high quality revenue, isn't enough to fuel growth. However at this stage, we really don't have enough earnings data to identify any trends. The good news is, TEAM has been profitable since going public. And the fact that it has been able to scale revenue growth so quickly while still maintaining profitability is a big positive. Gross margins are also indicative that TEAM is making a very healthy profit on sales.There are two other good signs that indicate the growth of TEAM is healthy and cash rich. First of all, operating cash flow is not only growing consistently, it's significantly higher than net income. And TEAM is reinvesting this cash in the business. Over time, this should show up as growing book value per share, but we simply don't have enough data just yet. For now, here's a look at operating cash flow. This shows TEAM is having no trouble collecting licensing and subscription revenue for its suite of products:The other good sign is that TEAM has a very clean balance sheet. Not only are they generating cash, but they also don't have any debt to pay. That means all their cash can be put productively to use, to the benefit of equity holders. Plus, current liabilities are well covered by $50M in working capital. While employee options are an inevitable reality, given this strong financial position I'm cautiously optimistic TEAM shareholders won't be grossly diluted.Now, before we wrap this up, there's still one big problem to acknowledge. As far as I can tell, there's no way around the fact that shares of TEAM are expensive. The forward P/E is 81. I believe this is a little misleading. If you use TTM operating cash flow in place of earnings, the ratio comes down to about 50. This is obviously still high. But I think TEAM is only going to keep taking profitable steps forward. And that may be the price to get in on the ground floor.Conclusion: I'm happy to team up with TEAMUnfortunately, there's really not enough information to make an informed decision about the financial trends of TEAM. While growth is impressive, the publicly available track record isn't. I'm encouraged by the cash flow generation and from what I've heard about the value of agile development. If this is the infrastructure that powers this new management paradigm, it could be here to stay.With all that in mind, I've decided to start a small position in TEAM. I'm going to monitor new data very closely, as it becomes available. And if profitable revenue growth can continue, I'll likely add to my position, without making it too much of my portfolio.So now let me ask you, do you think TEAM is worth investing in? Or is it too risky given the lack of publicly disclosed operating history and high price tag?"

The sell-side seems overawed, bulls keep looking for similarities with the early years of Google (Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)) or Facebook (FB) (two founders at the helm with significant insider ownership and focused on creating an ecosystem while solving a bigger problem, which is team productivity in this case), while the bears are clamoring that the stock is extremely expensive. The fundamentals seem to suggest that living up to the high hopes may not be easy for the business, but disappointment might be a good opportunity for long-term investors.Image Source: HipChat site AtlassianThere are limited concerns over the long-term potential of the business if the current momentum continues, especially in terms of product innovation. The company's products are well respected, especially among developers who usually are a leading user base that any tech or software company aspires to reach, but the ability to penetrate into wider consumer markets is often debated. Another worry is the lack of a wide product range, with just half a dozen products driving most of the revenue. Valuation is very rich, be it based on earnings or cash flows and the dilution may not help the company's case either. The customer additions during the last quarter, with net additions declining sequentially, was relatively slow. Competitively, more than the listed cloud companies, the news flow out of startups like Slack may cast a shadow on the stock, even though shrinking financing options, be it an IPO or private funding, for the startups may ease those pressures. Financially, like any other fast growing business, operating expenses are growing, overshadowing the leverage benefits that are usually expected from any cloud-based model.But even with all these concerns, the business does not look like a short candidate, other than maybe some short-term trading opportunities. Valuation is important, but the name is clearly driven by growth-focused investors and there is little to suggest that growth is about to end. Having mostly subscription (31% of the total revenue), maintenance (49%) and perpetual license (14%) based revenues ensures high visibility and the market may be more interested in measuring the long-term prospects of the business or whether the business can grow into a rich valuation. The growth, as the slow customer addition of the last quarter suggests, may not be linear, but the long tail of existing revenue sources and opportunities for further expansion (more products and markets) may continue to provide a cushion from near-term volatility. The company has successfully differentiated against other software and cloud-based services companies, and solutions like the third-party application model for HipChat may continue to drive this differentiation.The catalysts are worth remembering, especially during any kind of temporary volatilityImage Source: SEC filingsThe fast growth is mixed with high visibility in the model. All five product categories (JIRA, Confluence, HipChat, BitBucket and JIRA Service Desk) are focused on team productivity. Other than license, which is related to the fees earned from the sale of perpetual licenses for servers or behind the firewall products, which gets recognized at the time of sale and is growing at merely high single digits because of the transition to the cloud, all segments are growing at high double digits. The subscription revenues (mostly fees earned from the sale of cloud products) are recognized ratable over the term of the contract, while the maintenance revenues are fees earned from updates, upgrades and technical product support, most of which do not tend to swing wildly. The combined subscription and maintenance is almost 80% of the revenue.The 'other' revenue segment, around 6% of the total mix, is overlooked and includes the fees received from the sale of third-party add-ons and extensions in the Atlassian marketplace, but if the growth momentum is maintained, the other category has the potential to surpass the license segment by next year.New products, product extensions, market expansion and pricing are some of the levers/opportunities that should help maintain or accelerate the growth. The launch of three JIRA offerings recently - JIRA software, JIRA Service Desk, and JIRA Call should help expand the use of JIRA beyond their software teams. Service Desk, previously an add-on on top of JIRA, but now separated, is the fastest growing product in the history of the company. Although far behind in matching the ecosystem offered by the enterprise marketplaces of Salesforce (CRM) and Amazon (AMZN), the momentum seems to be picking up for the Atlassian Marketplace, which is one of the largest enterprise marketplaces behind the two major players. Price 'optimizations' constitute a major part of the topline growth story, making up almost 12% of the total 45% revenue growth experienced in the last quarter. As for competitive positioning, as the chart below shows, it's mainly Yammer (acquired by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in 2012) and Slack, but it's worth noting that Yammer's founder left Microsoft in 2014 and the product has failed to make a huge dent. Slack is private and does not have the similar breadth of product offerings. Slack mostly competes with HipChat offering.Background image source: Interactive IntelligenceBesides the availability of equity as a currency, which, looking at the historical track record, the company may not be using it as aggressively for acquisitions, the business should start reaping benefits of being a public company in more ways than one, be it attracting talent, as seen via a new CTO and board members or visibility in front of customers.Definitely expensive, but may continue to stay that wayFinancially, it is not easy to argue that the earnings can grow into the valuation in the short term, but if the topline growth sustains and the spending (which may continue at an elevated levels) is driven by growth initiatives, the market may be forgiving, much more than it usually is towards some of the old tech businesses.The model offers high margins and there is enough operating leverage in the model, but the EPS growth may be limited in the near term, mainly due to the rising share count, increased operating expense spending (especially research & development and investments in facilities and data centers). But considering the cash of almost $700 million and expected free cash flow margin of approximately 18-20%, concerns over EPS may be limited, at least for a while.The gross margins near 86% are fine, but the R&D expenses around 44% of total revenue (36% excluding stock-based compensation), and a continued focus on R&D may be the biggest thing slowing down the move towards the long-term (five years) model range of 20-30% operating margins. Even though the Street estimates may move higher, EPS growth may be limited for this fiscal year (June) and next due to continued investments and increased share count, as expected of any growth story that just went public, but by fiscal 2018, EPS should start to fully reflect the benefits of operating leverage of a cloud model. Indeed, expecting even a high double-digit EPS growth may not be too off.As for valuation, the name may look expensive on a standalone basis, but on a relative basis, it seems to be trading inline with other cloud names, even though the prospects of monetizing smaller size enterprises, or even consumer markets down the road that can help the company position products like HipChat against the likes of Skype that has close to a 300 million user base, are much better, e.g. other companies may be targeting the top 500 or 5,000 enterprises, Atlassian's solutions are targeting the top 500,000. Which is why the company's ability to offer both cloud and server-based solutions as well as an online distribution model should help. As for the Street's estimates and the lack of EPS growth for next year, the estimates have already started to move higher.Source: Y! FinanceBottom line: It's hard to expect positive surprises on the numbers front, but doubts over the pace of customer additions, rollout of new products or competition may reset expectations, offering a good opportunity for long-term investors."

Atlassian provides a variety of team productivity software and collaborative solutions. The company was founded in 2002, and originally was started solely to focus on developer productivity tools. As adoption of the company's products has picked up, TEAM has diversified its product set to allow collaboration amongst developers and non-developers, thereby expanding its potential use to touch the whole company instead of smaller groups.The company employs no direct sales force and instead relies on organic growth and paid marketing to scale the business while continuing to create products that users enjoy. As the user base has grown to 5mm monthly active users, the company's many products have become an integrated platform upon which developers are building third-party niche tools to augment the total value of the offering and generate some revenue for themselves. The productivity market used to be dominated by companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (Microsoft Office may forever in history be known as the greatest win in this space), but has now shifted to emerging companies that are using collaborative workflows and messaging as the linchpin to enter into this market. As software continues to ""eat the world"", the productivity market will rapidly expand alongside providing opportunities for innovative companies such as TEAM, Slack, Quip, and Asana to take market share.TEAM serves customers that span software, IT & service, S&M, HR, finance and legal teams of companies ranging in size from startups to large corporates. The company has 5mm MAUs spread across 450k organizations and 51k paying customers in 160 countries. In FY2015, had 864 customers paying $50k or more with no customer contributing more than 1% of revenue or ~$3.2mm. The company generates 90% of transactions through its website, which shows the low CAC that needs to be spent to acquire customers (i.e. SEO spend, conferences, and other paid marketing). The company's culture is solely focused on the customer and rapidly iterates product updates to incorporate user feedback. Since 2006, TEAM has acquired 10 startups including two of the platform's core products: HipChat and Bitbucket. The successful integration of acquired technology into meaningful products driving platform growth gives me greater confidence in management's understanding of users' emerging needs.MarketGartner has reported that the Applications Development market was $8.8B and the IT Operations Tools Market was $9.1B in 2015. These markets are expanding at rapid CAGRs, but there is significant TAM expansion possible by providing employee connectivity across all industries and workplaces and perhaps even displacing some typically human capital intensive roles (like assistants). Many companies targeting the productivity market are betting on AI as the next frontier. The interesting aspect of AI is that it is useful if the scale of users is large enough. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), through Gchat and Gmail, have the lead in personal communications. However, in the workplace, productivity solutions have the advantage due to the scale of user data that these platforms have.Imagine that you are a HipChat, messaging service of TEAM, user and are talking with another worker about an upcoming business trip. You are trying to arrange travel dates, book hotels, and discussing restaurants to go to. A HipChat or Slack can use your data to learn your preferences and over time book your flights on your airline of choice, schedule meetings by integrating with various calendars, and book your reservations at certain restaurants. Slack has already developed a Slackbot and even has a Botkit with APIs directed towards helping developers create AI agents within Slack. While Slack definitely has the lead on messaging, TEAM has a number of products highly integrated into the ecosystem of employees at various companies and can then use the platform to bring users onto HipChat to deliver a great messaging/AI experience. With its CAC light business model, the company is able to develop significant resources to R&D and acquisitions to make sure the platform is prepared to handle all the relevant needs of the users.What is driving the market growth outside of just pure messaging is the need for constant collaboration amongst technical teams that are assembling different parts of code or schematics and need to interact regularly with other team members to make sure all the parts can flow together. As there are low barriers to entry to make a productivity product (you can thank AWS here), there is a fragmented market filled with large incumbents like Microsoft and startups like Slack delivering different products. The market is highly acquisitive and will continue to be, as moonshots are taken on AI/machine learning software, etc.ProductAtlassian has a number of individual products that create its platform. JIRA and Confluence are the two most used items. Major product roll-outs historically can be found in the picture below:JIRA: Workflow management system that tracks and manages projects and activities. It provides dashboards for other users to see where in the process the projects are, creates comprehensive reports, and is easily searchable.Confluence: Social content product that allows content to be created, shared, edited while being collaborative for all team members to see and comment.HipChat: Real-time communication product allowing various forms of chat (audio, video, text). HipChat was an acquired technology integrated with all other products so that notifications for different workflows/projects can be seen across various endpoints by users.Bitbucket: Secure code management product for developer/engineering teams. This was an acquired technology.JIRA Service Desk: Customer service for IT, legal and HR teams with ticket management and self-service options.Atlassian Marketplace: The third-party developer marketplace where add-ons/extensions are created to augment the usability of the platform. As of September 2015, 36% of customers had purchased additional marketplace offerings.The company devotes a significant amount of resources (50% of all employees) to R&D, and as such, has developed other software developer specific products. Many of these products have evolved from TEAM's internal ""ship-it"" hackathons, which allow various groups within the company to create new products. This innovative culture not only provides lock-in to your employee base which gets excited about the opportunity to create something new, but also creates useful products to expand the platform's usefulness such as JIRA Service Desk. Although teams around the world may use different products, the company is able to aggregate user data to analyze and better target customers with in-product marketing expanding the product set that these customers eventually purchase. Evernote does something similar by recommending articles to read related to the notes that have been written.According to engineering checks, I conducted at various startup and public companies, most teams use Slack as the messaging app of choice due to the much better UI and developer marketplace. Many of those teams do still pay for HipChat due to the integration with JIRA and Confluence. Bitbucket is the other product that I heard mentioned a lot although teams say that Github is still the preferred code sharing mechanism. The fact that 2/3 of current revenue comes from JIRA and Confluence is a bit concerning for the future of the company. Investors have to bet that the customer focused culture of the company and large investments in R&D are enough to continue, creating valuable products to users and expand the moat of the platform.Business ModelTEAM's business model is simply to make useful collaborative products that improve the ability of teams to complete tasks. By being solely focused on the customers' needs, the company is able to rely on the virality of the product to drive organic growth. Word-of-mouth and channel sales (25% of revenues) drive revenue while paid marketing is used to introduce the product to new users who haven't heard of the platform before. Paid marketing takes the form of SEO, developer bootcamps, and user summits. Essentially, the company has low customer acquisition costs and relatively high lifetime-value as customers are buying the products due to their usefulness rather than because a higher up individual was convinced it will drive costs savings. Traditional enterprise software is sold this way with direct salespeople, targeting CIOs/CTOs and selling to them rather than the actual employees who will need to use the product day in and day out. This lengthens the sales cycle (longer period to payback CAC which can cause working capital issues) and reduces the margins/unit economics on the sale.The CAC light model allows TEAM to invest significantly in R&D to drive the product forward and fulfill more users' needs. Continued product improvements and innovations are needed for the company to maintain customers and upsell existing customers. TEAM is focused on building out a robust cloud offering as customers transition from on-prem solutions and expects that this will be a major R&D expense for the next couple of years. R&D expenses also include acquisition integration resources as the company expects to continue to acquire innovative products to grow the platform. The entire market is highly acquisitive and could just as easily make TEAM an acquisition target for Microsoft, Google, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).The company first sells to its customers through smaller developer teams that mainly utilize the JIRA and Confluence products. As the developers look to share their content with non-developer teams, the adoption of the product spreads and then the company can upsell products tailored to other segments. The pricing model is highly transparent depending on users and customization (on-prem deployment costs more because of overhead). Pricing for cloud-deployed products is highly transparent with teams of 10 or less paying only $10 per month and teams of 2,000 paying $1,500 per month. The decision to purchase can then be left to the actual teams using it rather than getting elevated to a budget meeting.In the end, the business model is highly reliant on customer ROI from the total platform. A big part of limiting churn is R&D to develop new products as well as enticing developers to create extensions/add-ons to drive further integration and hence adoption. Some of the best products that have driven user adoptions of platforms have come from developers: Farmville for Facebook, TweetDeck for Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), etc. Having developers create new products improves the strength of the platform and begets a network effect along more seamless integration with other third-party software and improving use cases.Revenue CompositionThe company derives revenue through the following four ways:Subscription Rev: Subscription-based contracts for cloud-based deployment; contract length can be 1-12 months (only 27% of revenues for FY15 but expanding rapidly).License Rev: Perpetual on-prem licenses; grow from new license sales, additional users for existing customers, and additional licenses to existing customer for other products; maintenance rev for each license is equal to the license fee.Maintenance Rev: Fees earned for future software updates and product support; First year is purchased with license then renewed for annual contract lengths in most cases.Other Rev: Atlassian's marketplace sales from developer products; TEAM receives ~25% of sales of these products.90% of FY15 revenue was generated from the existing customer base in FY14, showing the power of the TEAM platform. The company has historically been growing revenues annually at ~35% (net of increases in pricing plans). With ~75% of TEAM's annual revenues recurring, the payoff of the CAC light business model is easily seen in the profitability and FCF of the company. The company should continue to operate at ~80% gross margins although hosting fees will increase as the company ramps its cloud-deployments through AWS.ValuationAt ~$4.6B in enterprise value, the company trades at 10x next fiscal year's revenue estimates. This is above many competitors in the software industry; however, those business models do not have even close to the same unit economics of TEAM due to the large direct sales forces and more significant competition. Furthermore, Slack is valued at $4B in the private markets with 2.3mm MAUs and $75mm in ARR after having raised over $500mm to date according to this source. A lot of its rapid growth has been fueled by external capital, which has caused the great valuation for Slack while TEAM accepted limited capital and took 10 years to scale. Although Slack's messaging app may have wider adoption, JIRA and Confluence are highly ingrained within developers' workflows and daily lives. The stickiness of the product, rapid growth, and developing platform lead me to believe that the current valuation is reasonable (although of course I would love to buy this cheaper).For future conference calls and earnings reports, I will be highly focused on the growth of subscription revenues, what new products have been developed, number of add-ons/extensions increasing YoY in the marketplace, and if there is a shift in the revenue/user concentration in JIRA and Confluence. Basically, I will be studying all info for hints at a growing platform effect. In my opinion, I believe this company and management team are well positioned to execute upon these issues due to their customer focus and smart investments in R&D."

Let us see how this legitimate Billion-Dollar Unicorn is faring under public scrutiny.Atlassian's FinancialsIn its most recent first quarter results, Atlassian reported revenue of $136.8 million, up 34%. Net loss was $2.6 million or $0.01 per share, compared with net income of $5.1 million or $0.03 per share a year ago. Non IFRS net income was $22.7 million or $0.10 per share compared with $18.4 million or $0.11 per share last year. It ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $754.3 million.By segment, revenues from subscriptions rose 64% to $49.9 million, maintenance grew 23% to $61.7 million, perpetual license increased to $17.5 million, and other revenues 34% grew to $7.6 million.For the second quarter, Atlassian expects revenue to be in the range of $142.5 million to $144.5 million. Net loss per diluted share is expected to be approximately ($0.03) on an IFRS basis, and net income per diluted share is expected to be approximately of $0.08 on a non-IFRS basis.For fiscal year 2017, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $597 million to $603 million. Net loss per diluted share is expected to be in the range of ($0.18) to ($0.17) on an IFRS basis, and net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.34 on a non-IFRS basis.Over 90% of its business comes from existing customers. Atlassian ended the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with a total customer count of 65,673, up 27%.For the fiscal year 2016, Atlassian reported annual revenues of $457 million, as increase of $137.5 million or 43%. Net income was $4.3 million. Atlassian had built strong fundamentals with a lean sales team. It continues to follow that even now. Although marketing and sales expenses increased 37% to $93.4 million, they continue to remain at about 21% of its revenues.Atlassian's InnovationsIn July 2016, Atlassian acquired Dogwood Labs, also known as StatusPage, a leader in the status and incident communication space. StatusPage lets customers communicate the status of their services including incidents, performance data and scheduled maintenance. End users can subscribe to real-time SMS and email updates, keeping them informed while lowering support costs for providers.Atlassian plans to accelerate StatusPage's offering with future integrations across its collaboration portfolio. HipChat and BitBucket were products that were developed with the help of acquisitions. So it is good to see that it has a healthy acquisition strategy in place to help it innovate in the collaboration space.Atlassian expanded the reach of the JIRA Service Desk beyond internal service organizations by introducing features designed to support external customers. These include features such as increased support for customer organizations, enabling end users within the same company to share and collaborate on support tickets, and enhanced branding and customization of emails to support customers' communications with their customers.Other innovations include real-time collaborative editing for Confluence, the introduction of AWS support for JIRA Software Data Center and Bitbucket Data Center, and the beta launch of HipChat Data Center.Atlassian recently announced a new integration with Amazon Echo that allows Alexa to initiate conversations. The integration allows a user to connect Alexa to their HipCat room and teach Alexa to perform simple tasks. It also allows Alexa to proactively give notifications from HipChat rooms. HipChat also launched a group videoconferencing feature that can connect up to 20 teammates.Foremost among its competitors are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Slack (SLACK) for its workplace chat platform HipChat. In early November, Microsoft unveiled a new work chat app called Teams that is expected to launch in early 2017. Microsoft already has 85 million monthly active users on Office 365, all of whom get access to Teams when it enters into general availability next year. Slack has 5.8 million weekly active users. Earlier in April, Slack lost Uber to Atlassian's HipChat for company-wide collaboration as Slack was unable to keep up.The reach of Microsoft is quite intimidating, but if Atlassian continues to innovate and focus on the fundamentals, it should do just fine. And who knows, Microsoft may even acquire them.Its stock is currently trading at $27.34 with a market cap of $6 billion. Its 52-week range is $16.92 - $35.16."
4039261,96536,2017-01-25T08:29:31-05:00,"Atlassian Corporation has acquired online planning and productivity tool provider Trello, for $425M.
        This is Atlassian’s largest acquisition ever and should be complementary to existing clients and future growth.
        While share are certainly not cheap, TEAM’s strong brand and growth potential could support premium multiples.","Thesis:Atlassian Corporation's (NASDAQ:TEAM) acquisition of Trello is an intriguing purchase because Trello offers a complementary tool to the suite of software products TEAM already offers. It also helps TEAM consolidate the online kanban board space.Situation:Trello, an independent software company that offers an online productivity and planning tool, is being acquired by Atlassian . The CEO of Trello announced the acquisition on their blog, January 9th, 2017 (source).TechCrunch reports Atlassian is shelling out $425M for the purchase, with $360M of that in cash (source). This is their 18th and largest acquisition since founding 15 years ago. For context, TEAM currently has a market capitalization just over $6B. Further, as of the most recent quarter, TEAM has over $500M in working capital on their balance sheet and almost $800M in cash and short-term investments (source).As a private company, no such metrics are available for Trello. That said, we do know the company boasts over 19 million users. And for those not familiar, their core product seeks to mimic Post-It Notes on a wall to help organize thoughts and plan projects. This simple concept is a great way to organize complex undertakings and keep on top of tasks. Here's an example of a sample Trello board (source).Personally, having used Atlassian products as well as Trello, I can see why this purchase should be complementary and hopefully accretive for shareholders. It's also possible that Trello could serve as an entry-level TEAM product. And given Trello's popularity and growth, over the long term this could even end up being a low-cost way to acquire new customers they wouldn't necessarily reach through the developer community they currently serve.Atlassian's History of Acquisition:While Trello represents TEAM's biggest acquisition to date, the company has not been shy about buying products. Crunchbase provides a convenient summary of some of the larger acquisitions (source).As you can see, while Trello is an order of magnitude bigger than all the other buys, TEAM has been gobbling up software start-ups at a furious pace. And judging by the top-line results, growth has followed. I'm thus cautiously optimistic that Trello will be the same.While competitors like Slack still exist, TEAM is doing an effective job bringing together a suite of products to help software developers collaborate as productively as possible. I think this remains a secular growth market, which TEAM is well-positioned to capitalize on.Atlassian's Proof is in the Growth:In my last Seeking Alpha analysis of TEAM (source), I stated how one of the bigger drawbacks of analyzing this company was the fact that there is limited operating history to draw from. The good news is, since then we have another quarter of positive results.Revenue continues to grow approximately 35% year-over-year and TEAM is on-pace to annualize almost $600M in top-line results. Subscription revenue is growing at the fastest percentage, which is something I like to see (source). This recurring revenue base should provide a steady stream of cash that will provide management with the firepower to act on opportunity,Looking out, management seems bullish about their entire business portfolio. In response to a recent analyst question, CFO Murray Demo commented, (source)""Yes, we had strong growth across our entire business that drove that [40% bookings growth]. We did see an increase in revenue coming through our channel partners. There might have been some of it around sort of year-end budget flush with some larger organizations, but it was broad across our business. We are quite pleased to see that we had that kind of growth in the quarter.""Co-founder and CEO Scott Farquhar also commented more specifically on the Trello acquisition (source):""Trello is a collaboration service and provides teams with a simple way to visualize and productize work. Trello has attracted a great following and continues to expand rapidly.Over the past year alone, Trello has nearly doubled its user base, and now has over 19 million users in over 100 countries. We believe that Trello is a great fit for Atlassian because it complements their products; extends our reach in the business teams and is strongly aligned with our strategy, business model, and culture.""Given TEAMs strong track record of growth, and Trello's for that matter, this could be an interesting time to invest in TEAM. But is the price right?Why TEAM is Cheaper Than You Think:Across most valuation metrics, TEAM shares appear to be pretty expensive. And to make matters worse, the company doesn't have a lot of operating history either. The chart from Morningstar, below, illustrates this well (source).That said, I don't think TEAM is quite as expensive as it looks. There are a few important reasons for this.First of all, the Atlassian brand continues to gain value as the company grows. TEAM is a software provider for communities and teams. And since TEAM has been such a trusted service provider to their tribe of agile developers for so long now, I believe the brand value is quite high. Due to accounting principles, this value doesn't show up anywhere on the balance sheet.Another reason TEAM is cheaper than you might think at first glance is because of the growth rate. Due to the scalable nature of the TEAM business model, I believe margins will be sustainable, at least in the near term, so shareholders will benefit from ramping sales numbers. Even out into 2018, median analyst estimates are for over 35% growth (source).Further, I think growth-related execution risk is somewhat mitigated due to the inherently scalable nature of the business and the strong subscription and licensing revenue streams. These high-margin income sources provide a regular drip of steady income to help perpetually refresh the balance sheet of TEAM.So what does this all mean?Conclusion: Holding TEAM OptimisticallyI already have a small position in TEAM, and I'll seriously consider adding on any substantial pullbacks. I believe the Trello acquisition is complementary to the TEAM business model and could help speed up growth with non-developer users.While management certainly paid up for the acquisition, I like that they used mostly cash-on-hand to finance the purchase and only issued limited shares. Given my belief that this company could be a great long-term grower, I'm happy to see minimal dilution and hope management will continue to respect shareholders like this going forward.Finally, while the valuation is expensive, I think TEAM can continue to grow into it. Additionally, the steady stream of subscription revenue and stickiness of the product should serve as an effective moat against any permanent destruction of investment capital. What do you think though? Do you think this acquisition makes sense?"

3972478,98236,2016-05-06T16:59:07-04:00,"Atlassian recently reported results of its fiscal Q3. Despite the quarter representing another beat and raise, the shares have declined a bit.TEAM is a relatively unique enterprise software company in that it relies on a viral sales methodology to sell its products while investing heavily in R&D.The company's roots are in creating software to help members of workgroups better understand, manage and improve the performance of software creation - although it does not sell traditional AD tools.It faces numerous competitors in the space, but the competitors are not focused in the same way on workgroups and collaboration.The company's chat application is its most rapidly growing stream of revenue, and it recently replaced the chat of a significant competitor called Slack at Uber.","Is it worth exploring a novel company within an obscure space in the software industry.I think that Atlassian's (NASDAQ:TEAM) shares are definitely worth exploring. It really isn't because the shares represent deep value and they aren't valued on a GARP basis either. The company makes a bit of money on a non-IFRS basis and it does generate some positive cash flow. But no one can seriously argue that the shares can be recommended based on the company's current reported financial performance. What makes its shares worth considering at this point is that in the two quarters since the company came public, it has been able to beat projections and raise guidance for subsequent periods by meaningful amounts.That formula hasn't worked with the company's most recent earnings release. The shares are down almost 8% in the wake of another beat and raise, perhaps because the beat and raise wasn't large enough or because management spoke to investing in S&M and not about increasing short-term margins. Or it might possibly be the lock-up expiration for non-executive management in a few days and the expiration of the lock-up for senior management in about a month.The company appears to have achieved something quite remarkable in the software space and created its own product category which I will try to explore below. And the company, because it has created a unique offering, has been able to limit the cost of marketing and spend a disproportionate amount of revenues on development which is one way of building a significant product moat.Have you ever wondered just how projects get managed in the software industry or indeed in most any industry in which workgroups are the preferred modus for developing solutions? How can software development managers best deal with the quirky and highly individualistic style of many developers (sorry for the generalization). In recent years, a company has emerged that is quite far from the mainstream in terms of how it sells and perhaps what it sells in this space. Its growth has been impressive, but at least as important has been its ability to actually make money - well a little money, anyway. The company doesn't make application development tools in the traditional sense, and it doesn't really manage product lifecycle development per se. Its core product called JIRA really allows all of the users in a workgroup to plan, track and release software. The product was initially developed to track software bugs and their resolution, but it has now morphed to where it opens up communication between all the members in a workgroup and allows users in workgroups to manage the allocation of tasks, tracking deadlines and even on-boarding employees. There is no real way that I know of to validate the claim that JIRA software helps workgroups to release bug-free software more often, but that is the premise on which it sells and on which users buy. The latest iteration of JIRA allows users outside the software development area to use the product's functionality and undoubtedly expands the TAM for TEAM by a factor of several times.Nowadays the company has broadened its product offering to include a product called HipChat, which is a dedicated messaging tool within a workgroup, and the Confluence Wiki platform. The Confluence platform is essentially a venue in which work teams can create, organize, centralize and discuss the elements of what they are doing and what they need to do. HipChat offers specialized groups both traditional and video chat and which integrates well with the Confluence application. I think one observation I need to make here is that there is nothing that Atlassian does that can't be bought separately. Indeed, simply looked at on a comparison of features and functions, all of the three major offerings of this company have strong competitors. But this company has a relative long track record of success and has been a market share gainer for years now. The novelty that Atlassian seems to offer is the integration and the functionality of an integrated platform. And recently, it has been the entire platform that customers have been buying. And that is why I believe Atlassian's shares are worth a look.The Atlassian product range is in a relatively obscure niche, far away from mainstream applications such as financials and HR where the total addressable market (TAM) is several times the potential market for what Atlassian sells. The market for Application Lifecycle Management tools which is the space within which TEAM competes is said to be around $6 billion. While Atlassian is probably well known within the software development community, it is hardly a household name. But while the HR and financial space are filled with cutthroat competition, the solutions that Atlassian provides have far fewer competitors and none of them is exactly focused on what it is that Atlassian is trying to do. To use a sorry analog, Atlassian is like Australia itself. Very far away from the mainstream in its own corner of the world, but a business opportunity that has many positive attributes. But the interesting thing to me is that Atlassian has grown very rapidly and has been able to do so profitably (at least on a non-IFRS basis) and was thus able to have a successful IPO at the end of last year.Atlassian, in the wake of its just reported quarter, is on track to achieve about $452 million to $454 million in revenues this year, which represents 40% top-line growth. This company, having been around for quite some time, has a hybrid business model and continues to sell perpetual licenses. And because it has sold professional licenses for some years, it has a relatively large maintenance base that accounted for just shy of 50% of the revenues for the quarter that ended 3/31/16. The growth in maintenance revenues has been 40% year to date and 36% in the last reported quarter. Management has suggested that a significant component of that growth rate has been the product of price rationalization - I suppose that is another word for a price increase - that went into effect some years ago and which is still benefiting results significantly. The company has a reasonable free cash flow margin projected to be just short of 20% in the current fiscal year. That being said, the overall free generation forecast for the year of $89 million, an 8% increase from the projection at the end of the prior quarter, is not supporting an enterprise value that is currently about $4.3 billion.Atlassian does earn money on a non-IFRS basis, but still loses money on an IFRS basis, but not all that much. The company is domiciled in the UK for tax purposes although its operations remain in Australia. It reports results consistent with what is called IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) and non-IFRS. Essentially IFRS corresponds to our GAAP, and non-IFRS is equivalent to US non-GAAP. Australia may be a long way from California, but Australian companies can and do have plenty of stock-based comp. Stock-based comp of $21 million last quarter was 18% of revenues and that is up from $11 million or 16% of revenues in the year earlier quarter. Stock-based comp for the nine months of $50 million represented 64% of free cash flow compared to 47% of free cash flow in the year earlier nine months.The company has been able to start generating cash and non-IFRS profitability far sooner than many other recently minted software companies. That is a factor of several factors, but one important metric to note is that Atlassian is a hybrid software company that has sold and still sells perpetual licenses which have high gross margins themselves and which generate a significant level of maintenance revenues which have even higher operating margins. The company's overall gross margins of 84% year-to-date are up by a marginal percentage from the year earlier period, are significantly higher than those of most other early stage software vendors.A very unique business model, an overlooked niche, perhaps, and a not such a unique valuation. Is that a good mix for making an investment to generate significant positive alpha?I think a good place to start is to look at some measures of valuation. Atlassian has a relatively elevated valuation because of its combination of profitability and growth, coupled with some non-quantifiable enthusiasm about the focus of the company in developing team management capabilities. I'm not terribly enthused about non-quantifiable valuation metrics which seem to me to be a contradiction in terms. If the opportunity is real, it ought to be quantifiable but not everyone reacts the same way to these kinds of qualitative judgments.Currently the company's market capitalization is about $5 billion based on 232 million shares outstanding. With a balance of cash and equivalents of $720 million, the enterprise value is about $4.3 billion. The EV/S at the moment and based on a calendar year 2016 estimate of revenues of $520 million is 8.2X.For most American visitors, Australia is a lovely country. Its only difficulty for us is that it takes so long to get there and seems to us to be in an obscure corner of the world - sort of like TEAM. But also like TEAM, once you get there it seems worthwhile. TEAM really has a unique business model compared to almost anything else I have seen and perhaps one that could only come out of Australia that is far away from the confines of the herd thinking in Silicon Valley or Rte. 128.To carry the analogy one step further, even though my trips to Australia were business, I enjoyed the journey. I'm going to spend the balance of this article seeing if investors might enjoy the journey with Atlassian.Cut to the chase! What specifically does this company do and how does it do it that is really unique?I will attempt to describe the overall Atlassian solution in a sentence or two. The company is all about giving members of different workgroups the tools that they need to track their projects, to monitor what everyone is doing in a workgroup, to store all the data regarding a project in a single location and to facilitate the development of a chat site that is focused on a single specific workgroup. It isn't, particularly, that any of these functions are unique in the software world. What is unique and different is that the company offers an integrated suite of tools that satisfy the need to monitor, manage and communicate both within workgroups and to the outside world when necessary.Atlassian has developed a unique business model that is perfectly suited to the world of team development and developers. The company was conceived as a company to monitor software bugs and to track the resolution process. That was never a gigantic market, and even as the company has evolved, the TAM for what it does is still relatively small, currently being estimated at a bit less than $6 billion. Late last year, the company took its first baby step to broaden its TAM by extending the footprint of its JIRA product. One new JIRA solution encompasses the management of service/help desks and the other new solution is one that will take the JIRA process into non-technical areas such as healthcare.Even with those additions, the TAM is still not terribly large compared to other opportunities and it probably doesn't have fantastic growth rates. But this company has already had some success in broadening and enhancing its solutions by adding both HipChat and Confluence. HipChat was purchased in 2012 for an undisclosed consideration. HipChat pricing is relatively modest at $2/month per user. That being said, it is currently the fastest-growing individual product for TEAM, and it apparently has a significant amount of buzz within the software development community. Confluence was internally developed and has now been seamlessly integrated with HipChat although they remain two separate products.Atlassian has a viral sales model that's uniquely optimized for the solutions it sells and the customers who buy it. Most enterprise software is sold to business users such as CFOs or the HR Directors or the Chief Marketing Officer. Most infrastructure is sold to primarily CIOs usually with some input from the CFO. Neither of those groups are really Atlassian's target. Atlassian is trying to get potential workgroup users and workgroup managers to buy the software in order to improve the productivity and to enhance the communications of and for workgroup members/developers. It is a unique approach, particularly considering TEAM's scale and is unlikely to be applicable outside of the workgroup arena.Secret Sauces and Moats - How does a small company based in Australia manage to do battle with some of the leading names in software and build a real business?Atlassian has a remarkable business model in some ways, primarily in not having a direct sales force and yet in selling seven-figure deals to Fortune 500 companies. There is an adage in the software sales world to the effect that people buy from people and they don't buy products. This is the exception to that rule. The company founders, Scott Farquhar and Michael Cannon-Brookes, who are co-CEOs, have decided that by having the best products or better put, perhaps, a unique combination of solutions to enhance work team collaboration, it can induce viral sales. And so it spends a remarkably small amount of money on S&M and a remarkably large sum of money on R&D. The investments it is making are in product more than in sales capacity. So far this year, the company has spent significantly more than 2X the money on R&D as it has spent on S&M. The current run rate through the first nine months of the year shows R&D spending at 45% of revenues and S&M spending at 19% which is the mirror image of most software vendors. Obviously for this company to reach reasonable profitability, the R&D spend rate will have to significantly moderate on a percentage basis. On the call, CFO Murray Demo said that the company has a longer-term business model in which R&D falls to 33% of revenues. That decrease is probably not enough even with the remarkably modest spending in S&M to reach a 20% operating margin target. G&A last quarter was quite high as a percentage of revenue at 20.5%. That's actually up from 17.8% of revenue in the year earlier quarter. Management suggested that much of the increase in G&A spend was to scale the capacity of that function to meet the demands of being a public company. That being said, most software vendors of this scale manage to keep G&A expenses to around 10% of revenues.But in addition to determining if the company is going to attempt to achieve operating leverage which is not all that difficult for a business growing at 40%, there is the question of erecting a defensible moat. Obviously Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) SharePoint offers some of the same features as JIRA, but it is more about content management and search than it is about collaboration in a workgroup. While the overall Application Lifecycle Management space is crowded with competitors, and everything that Atlassian and its solutions can be done by other competitors, it is the integration that distinguishes TEAM's capabilities.There are literally hundreds of companies that sell project management software. But there are relatively few companies that sell tools and repositories for collaboration along with a specialized chat capability. Perhaps the best known Atlassian competitor, at least in the HipChat space, is a private company called Slack (SLACK). Slack is focused on the private chat space. Atlassian recently took away Uber (NYSE:UBER) from Slack basically because the Slack application couldn't scale effectively for Uber's thousands of employees. Slack has actually integrated its chat messaging into JIRA cloud instances.Slack's problems, beyond its overall inability to ""keep up,"" is that it lacks some security and identity control features. It is interesting to note that Slack currently is valued at $3.7 billion by private equity while Atlassian has an enterprise value of about $4.3 billion. Given that Slack really just does messaging while Atlassian offers both JIRA and Confluence in addition to its HipChat application, it is self-evident that either Slack is overvalued or Atlassian is undervalued.Project management software has been around almost since the software industry emerged decades ago. IBM (NYSE:IBM) has over the years purchased software development tool companies such as Rational Software and today offers a suite of tools that are designed to work with Rational and to be a part of its WebSphere middleware platform. As mentioned above, there are actually something in excess of 150 vendors selling software development and project tracking tools of various kinds although most of them are quite small and have certainly not focused on enhancing workgroup communications. Many observers these days believe that Microsoft Project is the de facto leader in the space. But the question really is what space?Needless to say, one can't go to the web and find some succinct and definitive answer to the question of JIRA vs. MS Visual Studio to use the formal name for one of Microsoft's project capabilities. One user did the deepest dive into the subject of Atlassian/JIRA vs. Visual Studio that I was able to find. The writer of the analysis self-described himself as a Microsoft enthusiast. It is probably fair to say, according to this analysis, that Microsoft's solution is more all-encompassing than what JIRA offers. But if the problem is issue tracking, then the clear winner for reasons of both cost and ease of use is JIRA. The JIRA framework also is considered the standout for project planning. Despite the writer's initial preference, his team ultimately selected Atlassian and are happy with the results thus far. Who is the winner? I think Atlassian and JIRA do well enough based on my reading through all of the surveys to suggest that at the least they are going to be able to defend their market share vis-a-vis Team. But on the current record and despite the lack of direct sales personnel, Atlassian appears to be gaining market share in the overall space.As I have said earlier, there really are many, many other project management tools. But this article isn't a buyer's guide to tools that are bought by users to help them manage their projects. It would be tedious and not particularly useful to plow through every solution out there. Suffice it to say, that on the record, and based on the market research surveys and the company's Gartner ranking, Atlassian seems to be the solution of choice in its space, so long as the use case is one that JIRA is meant to accomplish.Most of the other project management suites that users consider are essentially upmarket GANT charts of PERT charts that can be modified interactively and will tell users potential bottlenecks and the potential mis-allocation of resources. While it might seem that those products are competitors of JIRA, the fact is that they really are meant to solve different problems. That is really not the market in which TEAM tries to play and advisedly so in my opinion. There are simply far too many competitors vying for a market that is not growing particularly rapidly. What actually makes a commitment to Atlassian shares interesting in my opinion and what is actually this company's secret sauce, at least in this writer's opinion, is that it combines a non-traditional project management tool with a repository for work team information and a chat tool to help workgroup members understand what everyone is actually doing. That is a different approach when compared to traditional application development management tools or to other collaboration suites. And so far, without any significant sales effort, the concept is resonating. Users seem very taken by this unique approach and indeed the company recently reported revenue growth of 40% for the quarter that ended 3/31 and perhaps of more significance in the long run was its 73% increase in year-on-year subscription revenue and its 48% increase in recurring revenue. Recurring revenues now represent 80.5% of total revenues.How fast can Atlassian really grow and how long can it maintain a high growth rate?Because what Atlassian sells is difficult to characterize neatly, there isn't any widely accepted market growth rate. Most of the market research reports that I accessed suggest that the ALM market as a whole is growing at 8%-plus through 2020. Actually 8%-plus in the context of the overall very slow growth in IT spending forecast over that period isn't terrible. But no investor or potential investor in TEAM's shares would have the slightest interest in the company if they thought that its long-term growth rate might be 8%-plus. I think none of the market research reports has any focus on products such as HipChat and I'm not sure if Confluence is part of the base either.As would be the case for many companies, the key for TEAM is just how well it succeeds in selling its solutions beyond the boundaries of the software development community. HipChat's customers which are far flung and found in most industry areas is obviously a beachhead. The company's newer offering in help desk and in JIRA for other workgroups in verticals such as healthcare are big deals for this company. On the call, management said that the uptake of its work desk product has been quite pleasing.Management during the course of its two conference calls has seemingly been very conservative in guidance, and while it hasn't explicitly discussed fiscal 2017 and declined to do so when asked, it seems likely that the CFO will forecast 30% growth and hope to raise the forecast during the course of the year. The company, on its latest conference call, while not abandoning its viral sales approach, said it is willing to invest money to raise the profile of its solutions, even if that results in no margin improvement for a quarter or two.I do not think it is possible to give a definitive, incontrovertible answer to questions such as long-term growth rates or sustainability. My own guess for what it is worth is that this company seems on a track where it can achieve top-line growth of 25% through the end of the decade, dependent of course on the success of some of its new product initiatives.Margins and ValuationLike many, many companies in the IT world, this company has a goal of reaching 20% margins within the next five years. I think it is relatively easy to see how that might happen given top-line growth. Raising margins in the context of 30% top-line growth is relatively easy.The real issue is that this company is moving to SaaS quite rapidly now and the dynamics of that transformation are not well understood. The company is going to have to build out its infrastructure significantly which will impact free cash flow, at least over the next couple of years. A company showing 73% growth in subscription revenues will be battling some headwinds in terms of gross margins. So far the switch to SaaS has yet to see much of the revenue growth siphoned into the deferred revenue bucket which is growing but not growing at an extraordinary rate. That is going to happen shortly I imagine. And the company's maintenance stream, which is just under 50% of current reported revenues, will almost inevitably decline as a percentage of total revenues. Given how profitable maintenance is, that mix shift is going to put some pressure on margins. On the other hand, the business model of this company that is minimally burdened by sales and marketing expense gives some hope that the typical pattern of high reported losses in the wake of a growth in subscription revenues is less likely than might otherwise be the case. I think that I would err on the side of caution regarding margin expansion and not model for more than the high teens, non-IFRS operating margin by the end of the decade.Given the popularity of workgroups as a methodology of organizing non-production employees, my growth rate estimates could prove to be too conservative. And this company has a certain amount of self-engendered cachet. I think that Atlassian is the first company that I have followed that has revealed its diversity index which is apparently an important consideration for management. How investors might perceive that focus is harder to quantify. While those factors are difficult to quantify in some kind of rational forecast of valuation, I believe they do play a role. Overall, I would be surprised if TEAM's EV/S didn't compress below 8.5 over the coming years. On the other hand, based on the models of many other SaaS companies, the switch to subscription-based licenses is likely to have a material impact on the growth of cash flow for this company. It is hard to map the growth in cash flow without much more management guidance about how the switch to subscription licenses is going to impact cash generation. But my own guess is that if operating profits grow by 30%-plus/year, cash flow will increase significantly more rapidly than that. Overall, even if EV/S compresses, I believe these shares are likely to produce significant positive alpha going forward.Summing UpAtlassian, which is already a company whose revenue run-rate is approaching half-billion, has developed a fairly unique set of tools and developed a certain cachet among the software application development community. Its HipChat business is growing very rapidly at this point, and the company is almost certainly taking share in the ALM space. Its service desk business also is growing at greater than the company average. While none of the company's products are particularly unique in isolation, the overall integration of its capabilities does seem to be unmatched by any of its many rivals.The company has a quite unique business model which emphasizes substantial development spending and de-emphasizes sales and marketing expense. That strategy, coupled with this company's hybrid revenue model, has allowed it to become non-IFRS profitable in a relatively brief time span.The company has just started to sell to businesses outside of its base within the software development community. It has introduced a service desk product and HipChat is obviously not limited to the software development community.I have to be a bit cautious in terms of forecasting growth because so much of that is dependent on the company's new product initiatives. And I have to be more circumspect in forecasting margins as the company transitions from a model with lots of maintenance revenue to one that is much more heavily based on subscription revenue. Despite those cautions, however, I expect TEAM's shares to deliver alpha to investors over the coming years."

3843056,97396,2016-01-28T11:50:39-05:00,The changing software environment provides Atlassian with a massive growing opportunity.Atlassian can leverage upon its existing customers for further penetration.Atlassian has a strong competitive advantage over both larger vendors and start-ups.,"Based in Sydney, Australia, Atlassian (TEAM) was founded in 2002 to help teams collaborate better. To start, the company developed software to help software developers because of the intensely collaborative and highly specialized nature of software teams. Atlassian started with helping software development teams, and over time the company's collaboration offerings expanded to other business teams, such as the HR department, the legal team, the finance team, etc.Atlassian then recognized the need for collaboration solutions among all sort of teams within the collective work environment. It has built its applications to be usable by all teams and invest in new function and product development to further satisfy the needs for teams other than the software division.Here is a road map of the company's software developments:Source: Company filingsMassive Growing opportunity:Over the last decades, the demand for easy-to-use and highly functional development collaboration tools among both traditional and software-drive companies rose tremendously. The shift toward software-driven business models increased the need for Atlassian's core collaboration technologies that address the challenges of software teams and streamline the software development process. The market for software developers is largely driven by two key segments. First, traditional companies that are innovating their business model to increase the efficiency and automate the businesses processes. These type of companies include General Motors, Comcast, and HSBC. On the other hand, it is also driven by newer technological entrants, typically the ones that are renovating and redefining their respective industry. They are Netflix, Tesla and Uber. Analysts estimate that the market for software and technical teams, business teams and IT and service teams is at about $8.5 billion worldwide.The company have roughly 51,600 customers across a variety of verticals. Globally, there are more than 2 million companies that generate over 1 million in annual revenue that would have a need for Atlassian's collaboration software. The current penetration for this segment is only at 2.5%. Analyst estimate that Atlassian could reasonably hit 20% or higher penetration in the 1 million annual revenue customer base. This is because of the company's continuous reinvestment in its existing software's functionality, new product development, its scalable go-to-market strategy and its low-cost approach. This means that Atlassian can potentially be a $3 billion annual revenue company which is over 7 times the current run rate. Better yet, this does not include any upside from the company's potential expansion opportunity with its existing customers.Source: Company FilingsReference Customers:Their current customers include technology companies, scientific companies, large telecommunication companies, E-commerce retailers, larger print and digital media companies and filmmaking software providers. Most of these customers have been with Atlassian for many years. Once the product is adopted they are extremely sticky because the learning curve for new products are usually very high. Atlassian can leverage upon its existing customers and offer additional products for further penetration. Customers typically increase use as the solution expands across different teams within the organization as existing Atlassian teams buy additional products. The company provided a cohort analysis showing that customers have spent around seven times their initial purchase over the next five years after their first purchase.As of September 30, 2015, 79 of Fortune 100 companies and 273 of Fortune 500 companies are customers of Atlassian - this includes tens of thousands of users across multiple products. Translating to dollar figures, more than 850 customers are paying over $50,000 a year for Atlassian's software. Over the last three years, it has grown its customer base at a rate of 33% CAGR. More importantly, Atlassian focuses on customer success and almost all of the customers are referable to others. This is different from the traditional enterprise-based-quota-carrying sales team to win enterprise accounts.Software integration:Atlassian has been with most of its larger technology companies for 5-10 years, starting with JIRA to track bugs, resolve issues with data centers, and work the issues and bugs through different teams. Many customers also purchase Confluence since it fits into the same server set easily and its very favorable for customers to have a wiki system with its JIRA bug tracking system. It compliments well and integrates tightly unlike other third party software. Two years ago, many customers left Campfire and moved to Atlassian's Hipchat for additional features as photo sharing an social-media integrations. Last year, many customers added JIRA Service Desk to help track the process of their work. Companies chose Atlassian's JIRA Service Desk over other third party software companies because it was very easy to move deadlines and assignments between different teams. This was because of the tight level of integration among all of Atlassian's software and it was more intuitive for internal customers to use. Atlassian has been offering products that replaced a company's original software while integrating more deeply into the company's daily operations.R&D:The company is planning to invest aggressively in R&D over the long term to maintain and extend its technology advantage versus both existing competitors and potential startups. The company announced in its conference in November the updates for its software including double the speed of its JIRA software agile boards, five-times page response time for Confluence, increase the speed for HipChat by more than four times, and release of JIRA 7 which is a software for teams across the entire organization. These technological developments gave investors confidence that Atlassian is well positioned to continue delivering functionality that is well ahead of its competitors and disruptive to the traditional methods used by information workers.Management team:The company's co-founders and co-CEOS, Michael Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, have done an astonishing job developing and transforming the company's software over the last few years. They have been able to constantly expand their software offerings while developing new functionality for their existing products. Moreover, the company's CFO has over seven years of experience in the field and was the CFO of Adobe. I believe the management team has the executing ability and financing expertise to continue the growth and success stories at Atlassian.Risk:Lack of Long-Term Contracts:Most of the company's cloud customers are on monthly contractual terms and on-premise customers are on annual contractual terms. If customers decide to switch to a new competing service, there is very little switching cost. This also limits the visibility of the company into future revenue compared with other SaaS companies that may have customers locked in for years.Low Barriers of Entry:Some of Atlassian's product are not very difficult to replicate and new entrants could develop competing products without a huge upfront investment. That being said, most of the new entrants are focused on selling point solutions instead of a workplace collaboration product that can be used for the full scope of their businesses activities.Valuation:Source: FactSet and William Blair estimatesCurrently, Atlassian is trading at 9.6x its 2017 revenue which is at a premium to its peers. However, its estimated 2017 EV/FVF is lower than the fast-growth SaaS group. I think because of the company's massive growth opportunity, disruptive software and strong management team, the current valuation is largely justified and represents an attractive entry point for long-term growth investors."
3779686,20521,2015-12-28T19:39:17-05:00,We have seen several billion-dollar unicorns burning up cash to acquire new customers and jeopardizing their fundamentals.Collaboration software maker Atlassian is strikingly different in this aspect.I love this kind of disciplined company that's squarely focused on fundamentals.,"We have seen several billion-dollar unicorns burning up cash to acquire new customers and jeopardizing their fundamentals. Collaboration software maker Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is strikingly different in this aspect and when it went public on the Nasdaq under the ticker TEAM, it was lapped up.Atalssian's Industry PositionAccording to a Gartner report, the application development market is projected to be worth $8.7 billion this year. An IDC report estimates the collaborative applications market to be worth $13.5 billion and the project and portfolio management market to be worth $3.8 billion in 2015.Within this high growth enterprise software market, Australia-based Atlassian has made huge inroads. It has been placed as a leader in Gartner's 2015 Magic Quadrant for Application Development Life Cycle Management along with the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). VersionOne and Rally, which was recently acquired by CA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA) for $480 million, also made it to the Leaders Quadrant.Atlassian was founded in 2002 by Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brooks to help software teams work better together. True to its Australian roots, one of its values is ""open company, no BS."" And there sure is no BS in the way it operates. It has more than 1,400 employees and for two consecutive years has been named the best Australian company to work for.Its flagship products are project and issue management tool Jira and content collaboration tool Confluence, which account for almost two-thirds of its revenue. It also sells workplace messaging application HipChat, which it acquired in 2012. It also has a marketplace of over 1,800 add-on tools developed by third-party developers on its platform.Atlassian's FinancialsAtlassian earns revenues through subscriptions, maintenance and license-based models. In the past there years more than 75% of its total revenues were recurring from either maintenance fees or subscriptions. Revenues have grown from $148.5 million in 2013 to $215.1 million in 2014 to $319.5 million in 2015. It generated free cash flow of $47.1 million, $65.0 million, and $65.5 million for 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Its global employee base grew from 769 in 2014 to 1,259 in 2015.Net income grew from $10.8 million in 2013 to $19 million in 2014 but fell to $6.8 million this year due to significant investments in research and development and technology infrastructure for its cloud-based offerings, global expansion and development of new products and enhancements of existing products.In its IPO filing it warns that,Like others in the industry, Atlassian has also seen strong revenue growth. But what sets it apart from other players in the cloud computing industry is its profitability due to a lean sales team. In 2014, it had just seven people in its sales team. It spends just about 21% of revenue on sales and marketing. It, however, has made significant investments of about 36% of its revenues on product development and sales automation. Rather than a huge sales team it relies on data-driven insights to automate and streamline its approach to customer acquisition. At the end of fiscal 2015, it had over 5 million monthly active users across more than 440,000 organizations and over 48,000 customers. It seeks to convert this large user base into long-term customers and word-of-mouth advocates.The company has been mostly bootstrapped. In 2010, they sold employee stock to Accel Partners, T. Rowe Price Group, and Dragoneer Investment Capital to raise $210 million overall. The last such sale took place in April 2014 when T. Rowe Price and Dragoneer Investments invested $150 million at a valuation of $3.3 billion. Earlier coverage is available here and here.Atlassian's IPOAtlassian's IPO was priced at $21 at a valuation of about $4.4 billion. It closed at $27.78, 32% above its issue price, giving it a market capitalization of almost $5.8 billion. It's currently trading around $30 with a market cap of around $6.2 billion.Atlassian has been on an optimal path - a lean sales model, focus on existing customers and product development, profitability and revenues - rather than on raising funds at unsustainable valuations. It also has proved itself as a leader in the industry before going public.Also, notice the company doesn't have the bad habit of being addicted to investor cash. The investor money is mostly going into giving liquidity to founders and employees while the business growth is mostly organically generated from profits.I love this kind of disciplined company that's squarely focused on fundamentals. Atlassian is likely to continue delivering on fundamentals, and even under public scrutiny, will do well.This is a legitimate Unicorn with excellent long-term prospects.Disclosure: None."
3739386,70035,2015-12-07T18:35:11-05:00,Atlassian is a software firm based in Sydney. Its previous valuation put it somewhere near $3 billion.New valuations suggest it has upped this value by 27 percent to $4.2 billion.Speculators anticipate seeing an IPO as soon as this week. Tech investors say that Atlassian is just what the sector and the market needs.,"Both the tech industry and its investors have hailed Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) as the savior that the industry needs on Wall Street. For weeks, speculators have drooled over its increasing value. But Atlassian's IPO is about to get even bigger than previously thought.Atlassian's worth was estimated at $3.3 billion as recently as last week. This figure alone was enough to make it a unicorn tech company. But, as of Tuesday morning, the company's worth jumped around 27 percent, up to $4.2 billion. This makes it not only the IPO that tech needs but a fantastic end to a mediocre year for investors.There have been only 22 tech IPOs this year on U.S. markets. This is less than half of the 55 firms that went public last year.Not only has there been a disappointing number of IPOs, the tech industry has not fared well this year. Typical IPOs see a first day pop with a low return. Many of these companies are now trading below their initial offering price.Until it announced its IPO intentions, Atlassian was a company that everyone used but no one had heard of. Now, it's one of the most talked-about tech companies of this quarter. The group is expected to begin trading as soon as Thursday under the ticker TEAM.Who is Atlassian?Atlassian, the hero of this story, is an Australian software company founded in Sydney but recently re-headquartered in London.The company was founded in 2002 by Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes. The company has millions of daily users across the globe. These users rely on the company's products for collaboration, project management and making improvements to software development.In particular, it is known for Jira: a ground-breaking issue tracking software that services the software development industry. That niche market alone amounts to tens of thousands of customers and the app has now grown into three separate services.Atlassian is a unicorn company in the traditional sense of the word and in other ways. The company was founded by Farquhar and Cannon-Brookes using a credit card with a limit of $10,000. The earliest staff were friends of the pair.The company believes that if it can make a great product and offer it at a great price, there is no need for the overhead that accompanies sales teams. In fact, Atlassian has defied industry trends by not employing a sales force at all.JIRA is the company's flagship product. It's a project management tool that also works as a bug tracker. This software transformed from a project by a couple of university students to becoming the preferred software of customers like NASA and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).Most of this story has thus far gone untold. But this is part of the company's charm. Atlassian has maintained a relatively low media profile. Instead of focusing on marketing, it focuses on making its product the best that it can be.Joining the Investment BandwagonThere are a lot of reasons that the community is so excited about this company. Few people worry that Atlassian is over-hyped because it is simply not in the nature of the company. The revenue offered by the company alone suggests a compounded annual rate of growth of 46.7 percent between 2013 and 2015.In 2013, Atlassian brought in $148.5 million. 2014 saw $215.1 million. $319.5 came in 2015.The company also does not plan to spend its money paying off debts. Instead, the proceeds will be used as working capital and for general corporate purposes. The company has hinted at seeking out complementary acquisitions.Beyond its revenue and profit figures, Atlassian is a game-changing company. Its sales-free model was not a hit with early investors. But this approach now contributes to one of the reasons that it's one of the few tech companies running a significant profit for almost a decade.Atlassian also offers user-friendly software that people like to use. This is abnormal in tech, where IT departments purchase software that costs more to run than the purchase was worth.All these things point to Atlassian being unlike many other tech IPOs. Rather than paying people back, Atlassian has a clear path to profitability.Staying AwayIt appears that the only reason to balk at Atlassian's IPO is because of its unicorn status. But even this is a poor reason to avoid taking part in the strong week predicted for Atlassian.Atlassian's IPO is offering both the market and Silicon Valley the hope that it needs. Atlassian's business methods are disruptive in the best ways. Unlike others of its kind, its capacity to run at a profit means that those increasing valuations are to be embraced, not feared. Smart investors will jump the bell when this company hits the market."
3757026,25120,2015-12-15T12:39:12-05:00,"Atlassian is a great business thanks to customer-friendly solutions, impressive sales growth and actual profits.The IPO of the business has been a success as investors like these attributes.Following the successful debut shares are valued too high to create any appeal in my eyes.If shares re-test the $20 mark, I would consider taking a position.","Atlassian (TEAM) saw a successful IPO as the Australian business managed to convince investors that it deserves to be called a unicorn. Investors are attracted to the great solutions, steady and impressive revenue growth and profitability of the business.Investors have bought the shares following the public offering on the back of these qualities as the valuation of the firm has become quite steep. While the valuation is very high, it can be justified if sales continue to grow at healthy rates for the coming years. Such sales growth would need to be accompanied by some serious margin improvements as well.While I see better days ahead for investors in the company, if Atlassian can deliver on its promises, I require a greater margin of safety with regard to my long-term investments. As a result, I would not consider buying shares until they hit the $20 mark.A Great BusinessAtlassian was founded back in 2002 in order to develop software which can unleash the potential of teams. The company has developed products such as Jira, HipChat and Bitbucket in order to allow teams to collaborate in terms of project management, content creation, messaging and code sharing, among others.The company has grown from the ground up and relies heavily in word of mouth in order to grow the business, not employing a traditional sales force. Over the past 13 years, Atlassian has grown to become a giant, now serving over 50,000 customers and 5 million users. Having used Jira in the past, I can fully concur that this technology is very friendly to use and has been a major contributor to effective project management at very little cost.By avoiding an expensive sales force and focusing on the needs of users instead of that of programmers, Atlassian offers a great service for relatively low costs. This has surely aided the adoption of its solutions in larger business, but particularly in SMEs as well. Smaller and medium-sized businesses typically lack the financial resources to buy off-the-shelve software packages.The IPO And ValuationAtlassian sold 22 million shares in the offering at $21 apiece, raising $462 million in gross proceeds. Ahead of the offering, the company held $208 million in cash, not having any regular debt outstanding. As the IPO proceeds will benefit the company, Atlassian will operate with a net cash position of some $600 million after the IPO will close, as I already take into account IPO-related costs.The 209 million shares which are outstanding following the IPO have risen to $27 per share, valuing the business at $5.6 billion. After subtracting the net cash holdings, operating assets are valued at roughly $5.0 billion.This values operating assets at roughly 15 times annual sales which came in at $319.5 million for the year ending in June 2015. The good news is that sales grew by more than 48% that year as growth is actually continuing at the moment. For the first quarter of the new fiscal year, which ended in September, sales were up 50% to $101.8 million. With sales surpassing the $400 million annual run rate, operating assets are now trading at 12-13 times annualized sales.The picture in terms of margins has been less stable. GAAP operating margins came in at just 0.1% in the past year. This essentially break-even result looks quite soft compared to operating margins of 9-10% of sales being reported in the two years before.Margins did recover to 6.5% in the first quarter, having doubled compared to the year before. While the firm is profitable, earnings multiples are still pretty meaningless as the company already trades at a huge sales multiple.Looking At The PotentialRevenues being reported by Atlassian come in at $400 million per annum on an annualized basis, driven by a user base of 50 million. I think that the company has great potential to increase revenues per user and its penetration in the years ahead. If this is the case, Atlassian might be able to sustain 30% sales growth for the coming five years. If the company delivers on such a growth trajectory until 2020, sales might top $1.5 billion in that year.The company has delivered on operating margins of 10% in the past as I believe the company has more potential to boost margins going forward. Industry leaders including Oracle (ORCL) post operating margins of 30-40%. If Atlassian can do the same, pre-tax earnings could come in at $450-$600 million by 2020, translating into net earnings of $300-$400 million.This sounds like a pretty ambitious target and could value the business at $7.5 to $10 billion if I apply a generous 25 times earnings multiple to these projected earnings. If this scenario is somewhat realistic, the valuation of the firm could increase between 50% and 100% in the coming five years, based of the $5 billion valuation for the operating assets today. That means annual capital gains would be see anywhere between 8% and 15%.Final ThoughtsSoftware companies are inherently risky as they always run the risk of becoming redundant. That said, Atlassian has a great user base, strong growth, diversified operations and is profitable, while it has a very strong balance sheet. This reduces the operational risks of the business as the primary risk of Atlassian relates to the valuation, at least in my opinion.This is not to say that Atlassian does not have great competitors including Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) and Salesforce.com (CRM), among many others. Other risks include the strong growth of the operations, reliance on key staff and absence of sales force.While the 2020 scenario looks attainable, investors stand to make ""just"" 8%-15% per annum in the coming five years if the company delivers on the outlined growth trajectory. These are very modest returns if you ask me given the risks related to competition, growth and valuation.This makes me cautious as the current $5.6 billion valuation is much higher than the $3.3 billion valuation at which the company has been valued in the latest round of private fundraising.As a result, I require potential returns which exceed 15% per annum to justify the risks. That means the valuation would have to fall to some $3.7 billion which is equivalent to roughly $18 per share. Such a valuation would be similar to the preliminary offering range and to the private valuation of Atlassian ahead of the IPO.If shares would hit levels around the $18-$20 mark I would consider a small allocation."

Its products help teams organize, discuss and complete their work, and deliver superior outcomes for their organizations.Driven by teamworkAtlassian believes human advancement has always been driven by teamwork - from the great explorations of earth and space, to innovations in industry, medicine, music and technology. And while it's common to celebrate the individual genius behind a breakthrough idea, in nearly every case there is a team of unsung heroes that actually get the work done.The company also believes that the greatest lever teams have to advance humanity is the power of software innovation. Through software, contact lenses now monitor and report on the blood glucose levels of diabetes patients, allowing patient and doctor to better manage the disease. Through software, cars can monitor and report on vehicle status, improving driver safety.Read, write and converse with people in other languagesThrough software, people can read, write and converse with people in languages they do not speak. Each of these advances was delivered by teams.Software's transformational impact is forcing organizations to use software to innovate, or face disruption from competitors that do. Today, organizations in every industry are becoming software-driven. As a result, the teams that imagine, create and deliver that software are more essential than ever.The company was founded in 2002 to help software teams work better together. From the beginning, Atlassian's products were designed to help developers collaborate with other non-developer teams involved in software innovation. This breakthrough approach separated Atlassian Corp. from traditional software providers focused solely on developers.As more non-developer teams are exposed to the company's products, they adopt and extend them to new use cases, bringing the products to other users and other types of teams in their organizations. This has created an expansive market opportunity for Atlassian Corp.Virtually every industryToday, Atlassian's products serve teams of all shapes and sizes, in virtually every industry - from software and technical teams to IT and service teams, from sales and marketing teams to HR, finance and legal teams. Its products include JIRA for team planning and project management, Confluence for team content creation and sharing, HipChat for team messaging and communications, Bitbucket for team code sharing and management and JIRA Service Desk for team services and support applications.Integrated systemAtlassian Corp.'s products form an integrated system for organizing, discussing and completing shared work, becoming deeply entrenched in how people work together and how organizations run. Its products have been used by NASA to design the Mars Rover, by Cochlear to develop aural implants and by Runkeeper to create GPS fitness tracking applications.Intellectual propertyThe company has registered ""Atlassian"" as a trademark in the United States, Australia, the European Union, Russia, China, Japan, Switzerland, Norway, Singapore, Israel, Korea and Canada. It has also filed other trademark applications in the United States, Australia, the European Union, Brazil, Russia, India and China, and certain other jurisdictions, and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent the company believes it would be beneficial and cost effective.As of September 30, 2015, Atlassian had one issued patent and 22 patent applications pending in the United States, and it had no issued patents or patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside of the United States. These patents and patent applications seek to protect proprietary inventions relevant to its business. The company intends to pursue additional patent protection to the extent it believes it would be beneficial and cost effective.CompetitionAtlassian has no single pure-play competitor across all these markets. It does have a number of competitors for individual products, ranging from large technology vendors to new and emerging businesses in each of the markets it serves.Software and Technical Teams: Competitors include large technology vendors, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and smaller companies like Rally Software (acquired by CA, Inc. (NASDAQ:CA)) and GitHub, that offer project management and developer tools.IT and Service Teams: Competitors include primarily public cloud vendors including ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) and legacy vendors such as BMC Software (Remedy) that offer service desk solutions.Business Teams: Competitors include large technology vendors Microsoft, IBM and Alphabet (GOOG, [GOOGL]]) that offer a suite of products, to smaller companies which offer point solutions for enterprise collaboration.5% shareholders pre-IPODividendsNo dividends are planned.Use of proceedsAtlassian expects to receive $326 million from its IPO and use it for the following:Disclaimer: This TEAM IPO report is based on a reading and analysis of TEAM's S-1 filing, which can be found here, and a separate, independent analysis by IPOdesktop.com.

TEAM's initial and most popular product JIRA is used across the many applications being developed by many software teams across the country.(Source: StratUpSmart) JIRA has been broken down into two components, JIRA Software which is used for software development and JIRA Service Desk which is used for IT and business help desk services.TEAM's other products include:A combination of these tools provides the necessary components to support all aspects of software development.A little software backgroundThe current success and growth that Atlassian has experienced is due in part to the expansion of the Agile software development methodology. Agile is a development approach that differs from the more standard Waterfall methodology.The basic concept around Agile, more specifically Scrum, is as follows:As you can imagine this process requires a great deal of coordination amongst the different members of the group. Furthermore, tracking completed vs. existing user stories can be a task that is more difficult than it sounds.Remote and Offshore DevelopersAnother pertinent trend to point out regarding the software engineering industry is the push toward distributed work environments. In these type of work environments developers work from home, other office locations or offshore.Although there are many benefits to distributed environments one of the drawbacks is team collaboration. Communication difficulties increase to a point where productivity can be impacted for all types of remote workers. For example - time zone differences with offshore workers could be a challenge for project management.Enter JIRAJIRA was developed as a team coordination tool to support all phases of Agile software development from Planning, Tracking, Reporting and Deployment of applications. The tool is quickly becoming industry standard for Scrum-based Agile development. The tool integrates seamlessly with many other vendor products that target software development activities, which is helping to spawn growth through ease of integration.The product repository can be used locally on business owned servers or housed for a fee on the TEAM owned cloud.CompetitionOne of TEAM's biggest competitors, that I can see, is International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM). IBM offers many products that target the software industry. The businesses Rational product tool set includes products such as Clearcase, a source code management tool and ClearQuest, a product coordination and defect tracking tool.These products have a strong footprint in older legacy applications and although these products were developed with the Waterfall development methodology in mind they can easily be adapted to more recent Agile approaches.TEAM also has to compete with several other private businesses that offer free cloud-based coordination tools such as Basecamp.FinancialsA look at the latest financials filed as a private company show a business that has increasing revenues through increases in subscriptions services, product licensing, and maintenance.The expansion of operating expenses shows an increase of 71% YOY and 105% since 2013, with a large increase in R&D as well as Marketing and Sales. Increases in operating expenses in growing technology companies can be expected; however, it is something that should be watched through the next several quarters to ensure the growth is outpacing expenses.ConclusionThe growth of software applications across every aspect of technology is constantly expanding, which in turn supports the growing software engineering industry. As the industry grows the need for collaboration tools increase, which will benefit TEAM if market share can solidified.There are several concerns that potential investors of TEAM should consider:TEAM is going public with a $21 IPO price, which is above the proposed range of $19-$20; this give the business a market cap of $4.38 billion.I am disappointed in the price that TEAM has chosen and question if growth can support the valuation. As stated above I feel there are heavy headwinds the business has to conquer which may impact growth.(Photo Courtesy of Weebly.com)"

Although it has no direct competitors, it competes with a variety of companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Rally Software, GitHub, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), and BMC Software.Some notes on the company and IPO ...I smell an acquisition. Atlassian has an incredibly strong balance sheet. It has a current ratio of 1.4, but what is really impressive is that it has more cash than all of its total current liabilities - that is pretty much liquidity utopia. If that doesn't sound perfect enough, the company carries no long-term debt, which means no interest expense cutting into its bottom line or risk of interest rates. So if the company is in such great financial health, why the IPO?I can't come up with any other reason than for acquisitions. According to the prospectus, it plans to use the IPO proceeds for the general working capital needs, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. However, it does directly mention the possibility of acquiring complementary businesses, but has no agreements on anything specific at this time. My impression is that if Atlassian is seeking capital with its strong balance sheet, then it is eyeing some serious acquisition targets.Source: Atlassian's F-1The company is profitable. Thanks to its lack of debt, Atlassian is able to squeeze out positive earnings. Its net margin for the first 3 months ending September 30, 2015 was 5% which is pretty much in line with its most recent historical averages. The margin might seem a little thin to some interested investors; however, the company is growing at a rapid pace. Research and development has been approximately 45% of its total revenue. As the company grows and R&D lowers as a percentage of revenue, operating margin will improve and the company will be left with a solid net margin. In my opinion, the long-term profitability outlook is worthy of acknowledgement.Source: Atlassian's F-1The company is growing fast. Revenue for 2015 was $320 million, a 49% from the year prior. Revenue for the first 3 months ending September 30 is already up 50% from the same period of the year prior. Its annual growth rate has actually been increasing since 2013 and there seems to be no signs of it slowing down. The company also has some diversity from its revenue coming from subscriptions, maintenance, and perpetual licenses, which are all growing across the board. With such rapid growth and a positive bottom line expect to pay a premium.Source: AuthorConclusionAtlassian is an IPO that is worthy of attention. It has strong growth, a great balance sheet, and is showing positive earnings. My guess is that the company wants the extra cash for purchasing complementary businesses. If it is not seeking acquisitions then the IPO just seems premature. If that was the case it'd be better off growing the company organically and focusing on improving its operating margin before hitting the secondary markets. This company is worthy of taking note, but I'm just not sure how much of a premium I would feel paying for it. The company is valued at up to $3.6 billion which would imply a price-to-sales ratio of about 9, which means an investment doesn't come cheap. However, at the rate this company is growing that gap can close quickly."

Its products have been designed to help developers collaborate with non-developer teams involved in software innovation. Unlike several other companies that rely on heavy marketing spend, Atlassian relies on word-of-mouth marketing and online ads and invests in research and development efforts. The strategy has helped it develop a strong product lineup.Its most popular product is JIRA, a service-desk ticket creating and tracking system. Other tools include Confluence, a tool for team collaboration and document sharing; Stash, an application for sharing code, and HipChat, a chat program the company acquired in 2012. It also has a marketplace of over 1,800 add-on tools developed by third-party developers on its platform.The company has been expanding through acquisitions as well. In April this year, it acquired French video conferencing firm Blue Jimp for an undisclosed amount. It is using Blue Jimp's open-source chat and video conferencing platform Jitsi to expand its HipChat offering. It also acquired chat and messaging app Hall for an undisclosed amount to help build the HipChat platform support capabilities.Today, its products form an integrated system for organizing, discussing and completing shared work within an organization and have been used for ground-breaking projects, for example by NASA to design the Mars Rover, by Cochlear to develop aural implants, and by Runkeeper to create GPS fitness tracking applications.

Due to its low sales overheads, it has been profitable since inception. Revenues have grown from $148.5 million in 2013 to $215.1 million in 2014 to $319.5 million in 2015. Net income grew from $10.8 million in 2013 to $19.0 million in 2014 and fell to $6.8 million this year.By segment, subscription revenues grew 68% over the year to $85.9 million this year. Maintenance revenues grew 43% to $160.4 million, and sales of perpetual licenses grew 30% to $57.4 million. Other revenues more than doubled to $15.9 million.The company has been mostly bootstrapped and has not relied on venture funding. It has sold employee stock to Accel Partners, T. Rowe Price Group (NASDAQ:TROW) and Dragoneer Investment Capital to raise $210 million overall. The last such sale took place in April 2014 when T. Rowe invested in it at a valuation of $3.3 billion.

TEAM is as ripe a short as I have seen since FireEye.","Successful IPO Last WeekAtlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) IPO priced at $21, above the $18-20 range, and then rallied 31% to close the week at $27.50. Atlassian, the maker of JIRA and lesser known products such as Confluence, HipChat and BitBucket, benefited from a dearth of strong tech company IPOs. Atlassian now trades at an eye-popping 18.4x FY'15 and 12.7x likely FY'16 revenue estimates (assuming 45% growth vs. 49% in FY'15). While holders are clinging to TEAM's profitability, TEAM trades at a full 90x FY'15 free cash flow. Free cash flow will be wiped away and then some as TEAM is forced to build a direct sales force. TEAM is as ripe a short candidate as I have seen since FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE).JIRA and Confluence Lead The WayAtlassian's core product is JIRA, workflow management software that allows developers to issue tracking and code integration, i.e. bug tracking to the layperson. JIRA is used by 35k of the company's 48k total paying customers. Confluence, project management software, is the company's second most popular software claiming 23k customers. Success of JIRA and Confluence have come as developers and/or small development teams sign up directly on the Atlassian website and are up and running with the software soon after. As a result, the company has seen top line growth of 45% and 49% in each of the last two years. From the risk section of TEAM's F-1 filing:Atlassian must be commended for efficiently growing to a $400 million revenue run-rate without a traditional sales force. As a result, they have been able to focus spending on core research and development to improve current products and develop future ones. However, to penetrate the enterprise you need a sales force, it's unfortunately a fact of life in technology whether we like or not.TEAM's sales and marketing expenses increased in FY'15 to 21% of revenue, but that pales in comparison to traditional high growth software companies that spend 40-50% of revenue on sales and marketing. As a result, TEAM has been able to be free cash flow positive consistently. Many investors have bid up TEAM as they view it as a cash machine. Unfortunately, just like their competitor Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) realized, you need an enterprise sales force to effectively penetrate the enterprise.Direct Salesforce Will Be Needed to Penetrate the EnterpriseThe reason you need a direct sales force to truly penetrate the enterprise is both political and practical. When a small team needs to get up and running on a software platform for a few thousand dollars per year, signatures from higher ups, especially the dreaded CFO, can often be avoided. However, when software goes from departmental usage to company-wide, you need to evaluate alternatives, and various levels of management become entangled in the decision-making process. A sales person can help shepherd this process.Second, practicality states that if a company is going to standardize or roll out a piece of technology throughout the organization, you need to check feasibility that the software runs well with other software and is properly positioned within the workflow. There are also security considerations that need to be addressed when a large company adopts software. Again, you need a sales force to help navigate this circuitous, often tedious process.ZEN has a similar model to TEAM and, in TEAM's view, is a direct competitor in some business areas. As ZEN understood the need to hire an enterprise sales force to sell into this area, their S&M grew roughly $30 million each of the last two years largely as a result. ZEN's revenue from enterprise customers (defined as 100 seat customers) increased from 21% ($20 million annualized) in Q1'14 to 33% ($80 million) in Q4'15. Coincidentally, the $60 million increase in S&M equates to the enterprise revenue increase over the exact same period. My assertion is that ZEN needed to hire enterprise sales people and has not been able to scale it profitably in short order.If/when TEAM comes to the realization that they need to hire an enterprise sales force, in their words the following will happen (taken from their F-1):TEAM does business with 78 of the Fortune 100. To penetrate these accounts beyond a few programmers and/or departments, a direct sales force is needed.When TEAM realizes the need to build a sales force, they will likely be forced to take S&M spend from their current well-below industry norm of 21% to more like 40% (still below SaaS peers). Assuming 40% S&M spend would equate to a $100 million y/y increase - completely eliminating FCF and taking them well into the red, probably FCF loss of $40-50 million.Not a True Cloud CompanyThe second major risk of TEAM is that they are not a true cloud company. According to the F-1, only 25% of their revenue can be characterized as cloud revenue. Over 75% of FY'15 revenue was derived from perpetual licenses and corresponding maintenance contracts. Based on its revenue composition, TEAM resembles Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) more than it does a Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) or any high growth SaaS company.There is an obvious trend that I will not belabor of companies of all sizes increasingly moving to the cloud. If the cloud trend continues, TEAM is adversely impacted in two ways: (1) Headwind to revenue growth and (2) their model is unproven and will face more competitors in the cloud arena.TEAM's financials benefit when a client opts for on-premise delivery of their software as they can recognize revenue on the license portion right away. I would note that it is slightly misleading how they charge for license and maintenance. If a client opts for on premise delivery of say 25 users, he is charged $1,800. Half of that $1,800 is billed as license while the other $900 is billed as maintenance. In year 2, the client can agree to continue at a 100% maintenance rate of $900! Note, industry practice has maintenance rates generally between 15-25% of license revenue.From Atlassian's F-1:The second big risk of moving to the cloud is it is not their core competency and is untested, as they articulate in their F-1:As their business moves to the cloud and enterprise market, they will face much tougher competition. Let's break down the competition quickly for the main products.Fierce CompetitionJira - project management and issue tracking mainly for developers. Competitors in this area include - Trello, Asana, and Basecamp. While Jira is the leading solution in software bug tracking software, there are some developers who do not like the amount of customization that goes into setting it up. The following is from a Y Combinator forum and represents the feelings of quite a few developers:If Jira seeks to really pursue the enterprise market, they will go up against the service management behemoth ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) that owns the space and has many more resources than TEAM.Confluence - collaboration software and enterprise wiki for internal use mainly by developers. It appears that Confluence is often an upsell to Jira as it allows developer teams to capture and store knowledge for developers to share.HipChat - going up against the behemoth Slack, good luck. Enough said.BitBucket - going up against the market leader GitHub.Other Yellow Flags**Dual class stock structure putting overwhelming control with current co-CEOs that makes it extraordinarily difficult to supplant current management if investors think that is in the best interests of shareholder value.**Atlassian is a foreign private issuer not subject to same corporate governance as its US peers.As a foreign private issuer, we will be subject to less stringent corporate governance guidelines and different disclosure requirements than U.S. domiciled registrants. For example, we will not be required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as domestic registrants whose securities are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,**Atlassian sells in dollars but a majority of their costs are in Australian dollars. They have been a big beneficiary of the US dollar strengthening 20% vs. the A$ over the last two years.ConclusionAtlassian has done a remarkable job getting to $400 million revenue run-rate in a profitable fashion. Unfortunately, at 18.4x and 13x FY'15 and FY'16 revenue, respectively, it does not account for any of the aforementioned risks outlined. TEAM will have to hire a sales force to grow into a $1 billion revenue company, which will very difficult to implement.Net net, TEAM is an excellent short at current levels. I have an $18 price target representing 35% downside over the next 12 months. At that level, it would still be trading at 8x FY'16 revenue, a level comparable with other high growth SaaS companies like Hubspot (HUB), Zendesk, and New Relic (NYSE:NEWR).Supporting Documents"

But foremost, Atlassian is one of the best examples of flywheel SaaS companies yet. Atlassian counts 1,600 employees and sells four products, JIRA (bug tracking software), Confluence (project management), HipChat (internal chat/collaboration), BitBucket (code repository) and JIRA Service Desk (help desk software). On Nov. 9, Atlassian filed their F-1, a document preceding their IPO, and revealed how efficient a software company they have built. In 2015, the company will generate $320M in revenue.The chart above details the revenue growth of the business compared to the median of the 50+ publicly traded SaaS companies. It follows a beautiful geometric curve characteristic of flywheel business models, where an efficient customer acquisition engine keeps building momentum and growing revenues exceptionally. Note only the last 3 years of revenue are found in the F-1. The rest of the data points I gathered from the press about Atlassian.Atlassian's average customer generates revenue of $5,594 per year, which places it among companies like Zendesk, LogMeIn, ConstantContact and Xero in the smallest quartile. Atlassian has grown their customer base from 11,000 customers in 2010 to more than 48,000 today. Though Atlassian counts more than half of the Fortune 500 as customers, no single customer accounts for more than 1% of revenue. In other words, no single client pays Atlassian more than $3.5M. And only 864 customers pay more than $50k per year.Perhaps the most impressive part of Atlassian's business is their go-to-market efficiency. While the median SaaS company spends between 50-100% of their annual revenue of sales and marketing, Atlassian has spent between 0.04% and 2% of their revenue on customer acquisition in the last three years. These metrics are simply unheard of. They also imply a sales efficiency, normally in the 0.8-1.2 range of 4,000 to 10,000. The data makes it clear that Atlassian employs a fundamentally different go-to-market than the classic sales development rep to inside sales model championed by books like Predictable Revenue and popularized by Salesforce. This flywheel model uses the product and analytics to attract customers and upgrade them into higher paying tiers.As a consequence of immense sales efficiency, Atlassian is profitable - a rarity in today's software companies. Atlassian's net income as a percentage of revenue has been positive the last three years: 7.2%, 8.8% and 2.1%.In addition, Atlassian generates cash flow of between 15-18% of revenue. This cash, in addition to a small amount of venture capital, has provided the wherewithal to fuel the business' growth. In 2015, Atlassian will generate more than $65M in free cash flow.Atlassian operates at 83.4% gross margin, 12 percentage points above the SaaS median of 70.9%.Atlassian spends frugally in research and development, investing only single-digit percentages of revenue over the last three years, substantially less than the typical SaaS company, though spending has increased recently as competition in a few key product areas has intensified.Atlassian surpassed the $50M revenue mark seven years after founding, in 2009, similar to Hubspot, DemandWare, NewRelic and other great companies.Compared to the typical SaaS company, Atlassian has grown at roughly the median growth rate over the past 8 years.What will Atlassian be worth in the public markets? If we project the company to grow at 45% in 2016, a similar growth rate to 2015, then revenues will total about $460M. Atlassian should command a premium multiple. 7.7x forward revenues is the top quartile median, implying a $3.6B market cap. Workday and ServiceNow trade at 10.5x. And Xero trades at 11.5x, which is the best forward multiple as of Friday, which would imply a valuation of $5.3B.If nothing else, Atlassian is existence proof that an exceptional business can come from anywhere. It's a unique flywheel business with best-in-class sales efficiency. Every SaaS founder should study this business to understand the model. It's a case study in sales efficiency."
3749526,23822,2015-12-11T05:11:33-05:00,,"By Mary-Lynn CesarAtlassian's Thursday IPO was the last big tech IPO of the year, and it's being viewed as a big test for unicorns.Australian software maker Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) made its Nasdaq trading debut on Thursday, and with an IPO price at $21 per share, the company is the fifth-largest company to go public in 2015. Atlassian's IPO price gave the startup a valuation of $4.4 billion, making it significantly more valuable than the $3.3 billion reported in its previous funding round.Atlassian's IPO approach is very different from that of Square (NYSE:SQ), another unicorn - a privately held company worth $1 billion or more - that went public last month. While Atlassian boosted its valuation with its IPO price, payments processor Square actually cut its sky-high $6 billion valuation down to $2.9 billion when it set its price at $9 per share (the stock has since been trading above $9).However, unlike Square, Atlassian boasts that it has been profitable for the last decade, and has never taken a dime of venture capital funding. The software company's strong financials have some doubting the existence of a tech bubble and dismissing concerns over the growing unicorn epidemic. For reference, there are currently 144 unicorn companies out there, with a combined valuation of $505 billion.Since opening at $21 on Thursday morning, Atlassian was the day's tenth-most actively traded stock. The shares were up nearly 29 percent, and were trading at $27.01 as of this writing.Atlassian's IPO brings the grand total of tech unicorns going public in 2015 to four. Cloud storage company Box (NYSE:BOX) went public in January, flash storage firm Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) debuted on the NYSE in October and Square IPOed on CEO Jack Dorsey's birthday, November 19.Of those three startups, only Pure Storage is rallying above its 20-day, 50-day and 200-day simple moving average (SMA), suggesting that the stock has strong upward momentum. That's in line with the most traded tech exchange-traded fund (by volume): the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK), which tracks the Technology Select Sector Index of the S&P 500. That ETF is rallying 0.32% above its 20-day SMA, 2.19% above its 50-day SMA and 4.49% above its 200-day SMA.Click on the interactive chart to view data over time.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;(Monthly return data sourced from Zacks Investment Research.

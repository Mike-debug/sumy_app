Snowflake's (SNOW) IPO provides more visibility for data management players in adjacent segments. Talend's leadership in data integration and data quality will drive sustainable growth. Macro headwinds continue to mask the company's potential as it migrates more customers to its cloud platform. I expect sentiments to improve as Talend grows its cloud subscription business. At 5x P/S, I find its valuation attractive as macro headwinds fade.The company's last earnings result was impressive. By business segment, the shift to cloud deployments continues to drive ARR. This is a good development for investors betting on the reliable nature of cloud subscription revenue. Professional services revenue was in-line, which is impressive. Going forward, the shift to cloud subscription will remain a headwind to professional services revenue. By vertical, Talend continues to win in segments with huge data exchange velocities, like e-commerce and healthcare. By customer type, new customers continue to drive subscription revenue, highlighting the headwinds to the consumption of Talend's products by existing customers. The company doesn't break out customers with ARR greater than $1 million. Rather, it breaks out customers with ARR greater than $100k. This is a continuous sign that Talend isn't benefiting much from digital transformation initiatives in the upper range of the large enterprise space. Overall, it appears the company's growth factor remains susceptible to macro volatility given its decelerating DBNER print. I am impressed by Talend's pace of innovation via its Data Fabric platform. The partnerships with top players Amazon (AMZN), Snowflake, and Cloudera (CLDR) suggest the company is executing its strategy in the data integration and quality part of the data management space. While Talend’s hiring pace has been muted, I expect the tailwind of digital transformation initiatives to propel all data management players. The rapid growth of its cloud segment is also reassuring. I remain wary of the company's seat-based pricing. Most SaaS players are shifting to usage-based pricing to move up the priority list of CIOs' budgets. As more data platforms like Snowflake adopt usage-based pricing, I expect Talend to be impacted by competitive pressure. The current pricing model appears to benefit gross margins. The company's gross margin continues to expand to reflect the high margin of its subscription business.Source: Author (using data from conference call transcript)In the near term, cloud hosting costs will be a headwind to gross margin expansion. The incentive to sales reps to accelerate the shift to cloud subscription appears to be a temporary headwind to operating margin, as SG&A % of revenue didn't improve last quarter. Talend guided that Q2 will be the trough for operating cash flow. The Street is still worried about cash burn. The full-year FCF guidance of -$37 million - $32 million means deferred revenue growth, and working capital won’t be sufficient to offset negative earnings contribution to operating cash flow. I reckon this is also due to the transition to cloud subscription, driving more sales incentives. It is reassuring to know that Talend is reinstating its cloud ARR target of $100 million for the full year. The company’s current assets are just sufficient to cover its near-term liabilities. Managing EPS and billings will be challenging amid its cloud migration. The billings headwind was also worsened by customers demanding flexible payment terms during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis. Talend's huge exposure to EMEA and APAC isn't helping matters either.Analysts are worried about Talend's future as more data platforms like Snowflake onboard data prep capabilities. Talend's pace of innovation will be a challenging feat to match. Besides the company's open-source origin, the recent updates in data quality highlight its ability to evolve its platform. Talend's recent acquisition of Stitch suggests it is more focused on citizen developers, which is a compelling positioning. Investors need to overlook short term cash flow volatility. The improving pace of the migration of customers from on-prem to its cloud platform serves as a better yardstick of what to expect in the future. Subscription growth has been steady above 20%. While downgrades have impacted expansion rates, I expect more normalization as the macro environment improves. Some European countries are observing a second wave of the COVID-19 crisis, which is worrisome. Talend took a massive hit during the peak of the first wave due to its huge geo exposure. The company's cash position provides some assurance that it can manage through the current cloud transition. It will be good to realize more cost savings, as margins barely improved since the beginning of the year. Talend's valuation is reflecting worries about the volatile macro environment. The company's ability to innovate suggests it will keep gaining market share. Its recent partnerships highlight the importance of its platform. The company's recently added capabilities also highlight its stronghold and passion for adding value in data governance and integrity. This can also be chalked to the strict data regulations in Europe. Regardless, it's a win-win for Talend and its customers. At the current valuation, investors need to develop the required resilience to sail past the current period of uncertainty. Talend's growth factor will appear more attractive as the numerous headwinds fade. These headwinds include reduced professional services revenue, which is impacted by the shift to cloud subscriptions. Macro volatility caused by COVID-19 and the billings shift from on-prem to cloud subscription. Beyond these temporary headwinds, Talend has what it takes to maintain double-digit growth in the data integration space. The new management team has a firm grasp of the required strategy to accelerate growth. Further cost optimization efforts will assure investors that the growth of its cloud business can be sustained as we exit the year."
4347542,103480,2020-05-14T10:30:00-04:00,"Shares of Talend have risen modestly ever since its first-quarter results beat Wall Street's expectations.
        Subscription revenue growth of 22% y/y remains on pace to prior quarters, despite the impact of the coronavirus.
        The company has shuffled its go-to-market strategy and is seeing strong execution improvement across the globe.
        Talend believes its customer base is well diversified enough to not have an outsize impact from the coronavirus.","Talend (TLND), the ""big data fabric"" company that helps companies migrate and integrate data from various sources to be used for analysis, reported far better-than-expected results in Q1. Expectations for Talend so far have been low. At one point in the March nadir, Talend shares lost half of their value from the start of the year - a far deeper sting than the broader markets.Investors generally expected that big data and infrastructure software names like Talend would be hit hardest by the coronavirus. The tools that Talend provides aren't necessarily mission-critical to supporting remote work (whereas some other tools like Slack (WORK) and Docusign (DOCU) have obviously seen strong surges in demand) - and so investors assumed that big data projects like Talend would get pushed out as companies sought to conserve cash and simplify operations throughout the pandemic. But while Talend did notice some softness and deal slippage, it also said that it wasn't disproportionately affected relative to other software comps, and that the company's investments into its go-to-market teams have helped to offset some of the pandemic impact.Shares of Talend are up modestly since earnings and have risen ~50% from the lows notched in March, but I still think Talend's valuation and recovering performance leaves the company plenty of room to rise higher.I'm a huge fan of Talend for two primary reasons:A bit more on Talend's valuation - at current share prices near $30, Talend has a market cap of just $942.3 million. Netting out the $177.8 million of cash and $129.2 million of debt on Talend's balance sheet gets us to an enterprise value of $893.7 million.Now, Talend - like many other technology companies - has officially yanked its guidance forecast for the full year 2020 due to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic. Talend had originally projected $277-$279 million in revenue (+12% y/y), but now Wall Street consensus pegs Talend's revenue at $270.2 million (+9% y/y). Against this revenue view, Talend trades at just 3.3x EV/FY20 revenues.There are plenty of other companies expected to grow in the ~10-15% y/y range, however, that trade at premiums to Talend:In my view, buying Talend anywhere under 4x EV/FY20 revenues (implying a price target of $36, and 20% upside from current levels) affords investors a comfortable safety cushion. Given the new highly productive sales team in place - and the fact that Talend thinks the deals that slip due to coronavirus are delays that will be caught-up rather than truly lost - I wouldn't be surprised if Talend overachieves on growth expectations and sees its stock and multiple climb up as a result.The key message coming out of Q1 is that Talend's results were ""much better than feared,"" and the impact of the pandemic isn't as adverse as investors originally thought. Take a look at the results below:Figure 1. Talend 1Q20 resultsSource: Talend 1Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 18% y/y to $68.1 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $64.9 million (+13% y/y) by a respectable five-point margin. We note as well that Talend's professional services revenue - which actually is only a service that Talend performs at cost to bring in new clients - were down year-over-year (a good thing from a margin perspective), and underlying subscription revenues saw even stronger 22% y/y growth to $60.9 million. Key to note is that this 22% y/y growth rate didn't decelerate at all from Q4's 22% y/y growth - despite the impact of the coronavirus hitting in March.Like most other software companies, Talend reported that the coronavirus and customer budget cuts led to some deals slipping out of Q1 (but potentially resurfacing in later quarters). However, Talend did note that only 20% of its existing customer base was in industries directly exposed to the virus, and so it believes it's fairly insulated from any near-term demand shocks - per CEO Christal Belmont, Talend is no more or less exposed to the virus than any other typical software company (investors had assumed that, with big data projects being a bigger long-term capital spend that Talend would be much more deeply affected by spending cuts than other types of software companies).Talend also reported that its sales team, under the leadership of new CRO Ann-Christel Graham, has hit the ground running and execution strength helped to offset any coronavirus-related headwinds. Surprising to note is the fact that Talend called out particular strength in EMEA, despite Europe arguably being the continent whose economy was hit hardest by the pandemic. From the CEO's prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:Talend also notes that its sales teams have had no problem shifting from in-person sales tactics to more digital go-to-market approach. The company is indeed being conservative about its second-quarter growth forecast (its Q2 revenue range of $65-$67 million, bracketing consensus expectations of $66.5 million, calls for growth between 7-10% y/y). And while Talend is monitoring elongation of deal cycles, we do think a nearly ten-point drop in growth rates from Q2 to Q3 is overly harsh, considering Q1's March was already impacted by the crisis and Q2 will ostensibly capture some economic recovery as lockdowns start to ease. Overall, Talend's assertion that long-term demand for its product is intact makes sense. The coronavirus may have temporarily halted IT budgets, but the need to digitize businesses and drive decisions via data has not changed. Customers may not have the luxury of investing in this type of software infrastructure now, but these implementations will still be on the future roadmap. To that end, we wouldn't expect Talend to see anywhere near the same kinds of existential threats from the coronavirus that companies in the travel and retail industries are facing. Two other bullish factors are worth mentioning. Talend's ARR, as of the end of Q1, is up to $246.0 million (+22% y/y on a constant currency basis). That represents more than 90% of Wall Street's consensus revenue target for the year, meaning Talend's revenue visibility is quite high in spite of any coronavirus-driven headwinds. Secondly, the overwhelming majority of Talend's customer base are blue-chip, large corporations - so unlike many other software companies that are oriented toward SMBs (and thus more exposed to churn), Talend's enterprise base should also shield it from excessive revenue fluctuation.Figure 2. Talend core customersSource: Talend 1Q20 earnings deckTalend also is on solid footing on the profitability front, an added plus in a jittery stock market that has emphasized tech companies' profitability profile. In particular, we note that Talend's pro forma operating income has shrunk to just -$3.8 million, representing a near-breakeven -5.5% margin, and a huge eleven point improvement relative to -16.4% operating margins in 1Q20. The majority of this margin tailwind comes from travel and entertainment (T&E) expense from Talend's sales teams to comply with the lockdown orders.Figure 3. Talend margin/FCF trendsSource: Talend 1Q20 earnings releaseWe note as well that despite an -$8.4 million FCF loss in the prior-year quarter, Talend ended this Q1 at roughly breakeven cash flows, giving us additional confidence in Talend's liquidity to survive even an extended downturn.Talend's bargain-basement valuation at just over ~3x forward revenues ignores a lot of this company's strengths. Key to these strengths are Talend's large recurring revenue base from a primarily blue-chip customer base, a renewed management focus on go-to-market operations, and secular tailwinds that will drive greater adoption of big data tools like Talend even if near-term pipelines are disrupted by the coronavirus.Stay long here and use any dips to build a position."
4349249,21815,2020-05-21T08:25:39-04:00,"It's too early to tell whether the company's new CEO and a refocus on the sales process is delivering results, but Q1 was promising in this respect.The pandemic creates headwinds and clouds visibility about the pay-off of the new strategy, unfortunately.But we think there are reasons to be optimistic and the company's low valuation offers a degree of safety.","It's some time ago since we looked at French data integration platform company Talend (TLND). We still have a simple investment thesis though:The shares have suffered with the pandemic, although they have staged a partial recovery with the market:But the shares are still suffering from the impact of the pandemic and we think that's a little overdone.Solid revenue growth hasn't been accompanied by any kind of operational leverage, in fact the contrary seems to have happened:Data by YChartsSo it's not all that surprising the shares haven't been a winner, and then there is this:Data by YChartsBut there are two reason why this understates the company's position:A better growth metric therefore is their recurring revenue growth rate, which came in at 22% (in constant currency), almost twice the industry growth. Cloud ARR growth came in at 153% y/y but that overstates growth as it includes migrating customers from on-premise. Here is the secular tailwind for the company, from the earnings deck:It isn't hard to imagine where that 10-fold rise in data is coming from, enabled by 5G, the IoT will connect billions of devices producing data, then there are the big data and machine learning revolutions, etc.Then the company is benefiting from the ongoing digitization of business and the shift to the cloud, from the earnings deck:And it has moved its own platform to the cloud, where it is rapidly growing (earnings deck):Then there is the need for ever increasing customer experience, which also requires data from many different parts and data integration, this is another driver for the digitization of business in general and the services of the likes of Talend in particular.Management rightly argues that data as such isn't necessarily what customers need, integrating the data in order to be able to draw insights from it from the earnings deck:Then there is the need for the quality of the data, which Talend argues they are very capable of delivering:That is, they argue this is what sets them apart from the host of ETL (extract, transform, load) players and as we showed in a previous article, they do score well in surveys from Gartner and Forrester.The company is still able to grow through land and expand (earnings deck):In fact all these things (the secular tailwinds and advantages described above) were true before, but Talend seems to have taken insufficient advantage of the opportunities in front of them, given their slowing growth and declining net dollar expansion rate.Well, but they have a new CEO now, and they are going to focus more on the efficacy of their sales process. The crux is in showing potential customers exactly how they can benefit from data quality and integration. In order to accomplish that the company is engaging in a strategy consisting of three elements:These all sound fine, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. With respect to that, management argues that the first efforts are already showing up in the Q1 results, for instance (Q1CC):Given that Q1 results indeed surprised on the upside, we give them the benefit of the doubt here and management discussed a few success stories on the CC which are also in the earnings deck. But then of course the pandemic struck.The landscape has also changed as a result of the pandemic, with roughly 20% of their customers being in sectors that are greatly affected, and tending to hit the pause button, ask for more flexible financing, or even being late with payments.However, there are also other customers and potential customers who realize that the importance of data has increased in this environment, which brings heightened uncertainty and risks. There are the obvious examples (Q1CC):But there are also less obvious ones and to service this type of customer better they have created a rapid response team.What is quite remarkable is that APAC remained their highest sales growth region in Q1, despite being the region that was most hit by the pandemic in Q1, so here too we'll give the company the benefit of the doubt.On the other hand, management also argued that effects of the pandemic will likely endure in H2, with customers in distress placing less orders and a slowing of migration to the cloud.Revenues beat expectations by 5% and non-GAAP EPS, coming in at -$0.13 was a really substantial $0.16 beat of expectations. This is indeed encouraging and it's a pity that the pandemic is not only a drag (the company withdrew 2020 guidance) but also muddies the waters, making it more difficult to assess the progress the company is (or isn't) making.Professional services declined by 8% in Q1 (y/y) to $7.2M as a result of the ongoing shift from on-premise to the cloud.From the Q1CC:It's basically in line with expectations.Data by YChartsBy shrinking relatively low (12% in Q1) margin professional services, the move to the cloud increases gross margins, but as of yet there are no signs of any kind of operational leverage.Data by YChartsThe huge improvement in Q1 is greatly helped by the $30M improvement in receivables. Cash (and equivalents) holdings are still substantial at $177.8M, up 800K from last quarter. Keep in mind the company also has $129M in long-term debt.The company did argue they will keep investing and combining this with the impact of the pandemic they argue that this could add a maximum of $5M of cash burn for the year.The company issued $10.3M in stock based compensation in Q1 which is almost 15% of revenue, that's substantive and no wonder there is a steady uptick in the share count:Data by YChartsData by YChartsThe EV/S multiple really is quite low, a reflection of the declining growth and lack of operational leverage. Analyst expect losses to endure with GAAP EPS at -$1.27 this year rising only to -$0.99 next yearThe range of analyst expectations for 2021 is really quite notable, with the most optimist forecasting a loss of just 37 cents per share while the post pessimist seeing -$1.52 although this could very well be more of a sign of the times than anything specifically related to Talend.The shares seem very cheap compared to other SaaS names, but slowing revenue growth (even if part of that is caused by its shift to the cloud), slowing recurring revenue growth and a declining net dollar expansion rate are responsible for that, as well is the fact that the company is still quite far from profitability or cash generation.The product, as far as we can make out, seems well liked and in demand, and the company has secular tailwinds blowing as data demands keep on increasing.So execution seems to have been a problem and here is where a new CEO comes in. The first results are quite promising, but unfortunately will become much harder to assess with the impact of the pandemic.Still, we're inclined to argue that given the cheap valuation and secular tailwinds, any improvements are likely to lead to a valuation multiple expansion, not to mention business performance.The low valuation gives the stock some margin of safety, in our view. The new CEO might not deliver, but we don't think that will lead to an even further valuation multiple contraction and as the business is still growing the downside should be limited. If she does deliver, there is considerable upside."
4325366,103480,2020-02-19T15:24:59-05:00,"Shares of Talend have retreated nearly 10% after reporting Q4 results.
        This is despite a beat to Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines for Q4.
        Investors are potentially looking ahead to FY20, where Talend has forecasted only 12% y/y revenue growth (despite exiting Q4 at a 19% y/y growth rate).
        Despite slowing growth rates, Talend has been able to eke out small profitability gains. The stock's ~3.6x forward revenue multiple is incredibly cheap.
        Talend has a new executive team focused on driving a renewal in sales growth.","Talend (TLND), the big data software company, continues to be one of the most overlooked stocks in the technology sector. Talend was a smash hit in its 2016 IPO, rising more than 50% in its first day of trading to ~$28 - but since then, as growth rates have flagged, Talend shares have barely gone anywhere while the market has been up ~60%. The disparity only got worse with Talend's fourth-quarter earnings release: with investors looking ahead to an FY2020 with low forecasted growth, shares of Talend have dropped nearly 10% since reporting Q4 results:The question for investors now: can Talend eventually catch up to the valuation multiples of its software peers, or will it continue to lag the markets in performance?In my view, the bullish thesis for Talend rests on several key drivers:The bottom line on Talend: it's too early to count this company out. Especially at under 4x forward revenues (when the majority of software stocks are trading at double-digit forward revenue multiples, echoing concerns of the prior dot-com bubble), there's not much downside left on this name.At present share prices around $34, Talend trades at a market cap of just $1.05 billion. After netting off the $177 million of cash and $131 million of debt on Talend's latest balance sheet, we arrive at an enterprise value of $1.00 billion.Here's a look at the company's latest guidance for FY20:Figure 1. Talend guidance updateSource: Talend Q4 earnings releaseInvestors are rightly concerned that Talend's revenue guidance of $277-$279 million for the coming year represents just meager 12% y/y growth to FY19 revenues of $248.0 million. However, I'd argue two things: first, this slow growth is already priced into Talend's stock, which assuming the midpoint of this revenue guidance is valued at just 3.6x EV/FY20 revenues. Second, Talend's renewed focus on go-to-market operations may yield a turnaround in revenue and billings in 2020, as the company's new C-suite seems to have hit the ground running with a sales re-organization which we'll dive into shortly. The guidance forecast may prove to be a few points light, leaving room for Talend to achieve a series of ""beats and raises"" in 2020.We note that Talend's valuation puts the stock in the same league as some of the worst-performing ""penalty box"" stocks in the software sector, including Box (BOX) and Dropbox (DBX). I'd argue Talend is in a much better sector with far less competition, and with far more opportunities to pick up its pace of growth.Christal Belmont, Talend's new CEO, is a sales-minded executive who has wasted no time in reforming Talend's sales team in order to achieve its latest targets. The company has introduced a new metric by which executives will manage the business, Cloud ARR (which by no means is a novel concept, and as the name suggests represents the annual recurring revenues generated by cloud products).Talend's major focus for 2020 is to generate as much new business as it can in the cloud - which is where the data explosion tailwind is occurring. As of the end of 2019, Talend's Cloud ARR stood at $54.9 million, a relatively small ~20% slice of Talend's overall revenues, but up 179% y/y. In 2020, Talend aims to nearly double Cloud ARR to at least $100 million. It has an overall medium-term goal of hitting $1 billion in total revenues.Here's some useful commentary from Belmont's prepared remarks on the Q4 earnings call that describes the steps she has taken to hit these goals:Investors should think of it this way: Talend is no longer a startup, and the company is now bringing in go-to-market executives that have experience in building billion-dollar software products to drive the next phase of its growth. At present share prices near ~$34, investors have a chance to still get in on the ground floor. Another point we want to make: despite the weaker guidance in 2020, we haven't seen tremendous revenue weakness exiting the fourth quarter of 2019. Take a look at Talend's most recent results below:Figure 2. Talend 4Q19 resultsSource: Talend Q4 earnings releaseRevenues grew 20% y/y to $66.9 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $66.4 million (+19% y/y) and showing no deceleration at all from the prior quarter's 20% y/y growth rate. As noted previously, much of Talend's growth rests in the cloud. Of the new ARR that Talend's sales reps are bringing into the company, half are cloud deals:Figure 3. Talend cloud mix as a percentage of new ARRSource: Talend Q4 earnings deckWe should highlight as well that the company has been able to drive profitability gains in spite of slower revenue growth. Q4 pro forma operating losses came in near breakeven at -$1.3 million, despite a -$4.8 million loss in the year-ago quarter. Figure 4. Talend operating loss trendsSource: Talend Q4 earnings deckThis represents a gain in pro forma operating margins to -1.9%, 660bps better than -8.5% in the year-ago quarter. Talend's pro forma EPS of -$0.07 also vastly outperformed Wall Street's consensus of -$0.20. With the market becoming more profit-centric these days, Talend's margin gains will be able to offset some of the disappointment of growth potentially slowing to the mid-teens.There's plenty of new energy in Talend's executive team to shake up its go-to-market operations and rededicate the company to becoming a billion-dollar software product, one potentially primed for acquisition (we note that tech-focused PE firms like Thoma Bravo have been especially active in acquiring cheaply-valued software names, such as Thoma Bravo's recent bid for Instructure at just under 5x forward revenues). With shares trading under 4x forward revenues, and with the company still riding secular tailwinds from a global shift toward cloud and big data, I'd give Talend the benefit of the doubt."
4369467,103480,2020-08-18T09:56:10-04:00,"Talend has executed well amidst a pandemic in which many businesses have put a hold on long-term, heavy IT infrastructure projects.
        Talend's revenue growth did slow in Q2, but the company still managed to build up a strong ARR.
        The market opportunity for data integrators like Talend, especially in the cloud, is still large and growing.
        Talend's ~4x forward revenue valuation is a steal in a software sector that has drifted to much higher multiples this year.","As the NASDAQ continues to power the broader market to all-time highs, it has become more and more difficult to find true bargains in the software sector. There are articles this year that have correlated tech stocks - especially those with a steady stream of recurring revenue, like SaaS companies - with gold, thanks to their proven counter-recessionary nature and the near-certainty of their continuity in the future.Talend (TLND) is one of those rare finds. Talend possesses the rare combination of being at the right intersection of several ""buzzy"" computing trends (cloud and big data), and yet the fact that the market has always downplayed Talend's success means that it's also a value stock. Recently, Talend has released strong Q2 results that showed much better-than-expected execution amid the pandemic, and shares have drifted ~10% higher since. It's the first step in right-sizing Talend's valuation relative to its peers.At current share prices near $40, Talend has a market cap of $1.24 billion. After netting off the $165 million of cash and $133 million of debt on Talend's most recent balance sheet, the company has an enterprise value of $1.21 billion. Wall Street, meanwhile, is expecting FY21 revenue of $307.4 million for Talend (+12% y/y) though considering the - implying a valuation multiple of 4.0x EV/FY21 revenues. Other software companies that are currently growing in the mid teens, meanwhile, trade at mid/high single digit multiples. There's a lot to the bullish thesis for this company outside of a cheap valuation, however. Chief among them in my view, are:Figure 1. Talend TAMSource: Talend Q2 earnings deckIn short, there's a lot to like about this company - especially at such a low price that leaves a wide margin for error. Patient investors can snag large gains on this stock as it continues to feed on big data tailwinds and chases growth.Let's now review Talend's latest second-quarter results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 2. Talend Q2 resultsSource: Talend Q2 earnings releaseTalend's revenue grew 12% y/y to $67.7 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $66.3 million (+10% y/y) by a two-point margin. Talend's revenue did decelerate from 18% y/y growth in Q1, but that was largely expected. As businesses went into lockdown mode, the priority for IT departments was to enable remote work, while heavier projects like data integration got pushed down on the priorities list.Talend's subscription revenue, though, did see stronger growth at 16% y/y to $60.9 million (vs. 22% y/y in Q1). Talend's decline in professional services revenue is an indicator of lower new client on boarding, but in terms of margins the lower mix of services revenue as a percentage of total revenue is favorable for margins, as Talend is performing these services at only slightly above cost. Talend's ARR has also continued to expand. Total ARR grew 19% y/y on a constant currency basis to $256 million, adding $10 million of new ARR in the quarter. Given that Talend's next year revenue consensus is roughly $305 million, this means that the company already has great visibility and committed revenue against its targets for next year. And within this chunk, $75 million (~30%) is Cloud ARR, which has grown at 128% y/y as Talend's sales teams continue to focus on pushing the cloud solutions over on-prem. Management has also noted that recent trends give it the confidence to re-instate its pre-COVID 19 target for $100 million in Cloud ARR by fiscal year-end.Figure 3. Talend ARRSource: Talend Q2 earnings deckAlso encouraging is the fact that Talend signed on 16 net-new enterprise customers in Q2, bringing its enterprise customer base to 614 customers (+16% y/y). This is up versus a trough of just 5 net-new customer adds in Q1.Here's some additional helpful commentary on go-to-market momentum from Talend's new CEO, Christal Belmont:There was also positive news on the margin/profitability front. On a pro forma basis, Talend managed to increase its gross margins up by one point to 87% (making it one of the highest-margin subscription revenues in the software sector), while on a total basis Talend's gross margins jumped four points to 80%, up from 76% in the year-ago quarter - driven by the heavier subscription vs. services mix. Talend's pro forma EPS of -$0.07 also beat Wall Street's expectations of -$0.09.Talend is a company that plays in all the right themes, including cloud/SaaS and big data, and it's also one that has been recognized by Gartner (the leading software industry reviewer) as a Leader in the data quality/integrity space, burnishing its reputation as a best-in-breed vendor. The fact that the stock trades at a modest ~4x forward revenues in puzzling, but signals a great opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor."
4325982,100666,2020-02-20T22:53:30-05:00,"Talend is still 50% below its all-time high.The company beat on the expectations, but those had been lowered a lot and Talend even misses its own already lowered guidance.The guidance of 12% revenue growth is even worse. A year ago, Talend was still growing at almost 40%.As a former CRO, new CEO Chrystal Bemont has the right background to repair Talend's problems and she hasn't waited to shake up management.If Bemont could reaccelerate Talend, then the stock could take off fast because of its low P/S ratio of just 4.5.","It has been six months since I wrote my last update on Talend (NASDAQ:TLND) and a lot has happened in the meantime. When I wrote it, the company had just released really good results in Q2 2019, which resulted in an 18% jump. But to no avail, the stock dropped again too. That means that the stock is still down a lot from its all-time highs set in October 2018:Data by YChartsFor those who don't know the company here's a short introduction: Talend's core business is all about (big) data, more specifically ETL, which stands for extract, transform, load. Talend follows an open core strategy. That means that it offers free open-source software that can be used for a lot of tasks. But if you want more of the software, you need a paid license. Examples of add-ons are team collaboration, monitoring, support, and so on.As for FY 2019 earnings, the company had revenue of $243M, up 23% YoY. That is under the guidance that was provided in Q3, which aimed at $246.5M to $247.5M and that guidance was already lower than most analysts expected.In the Q3 call, Talend guided for Q4 revenue of $65.4M to $66.4M, and here too it disappointed, bringing in just $62.63M, up 20.3% YoY. The expectations had been brought down a lot by analysts, so the company still beats by $0.49M. The stock price dropped nevertheless.Normally, I don't like 'deceleration of revenue growth' as an element of a stock assessment. The reason is that there might be lots of reasons why revenue growth slows down. The issue could be temporary or growth could slow down on purpose because the company focuses more on making a profit, or the law of large numbers kicks in. But in the case of Talend, you can't ignore the crumbling revenue growth because it falls too hard:Data by YChartsIn just one year from the high 30s to the low 20s, almost right in two. That's not what you want to see from a company you own, especially because Talend is still losing money:Data by YChartsSo both trends go south at the same time. And the guidance Talend gave foresees a further deceleration. It guided for just 12% YoY growth. That's probably the main reason the stock fell after the earnings:Data by YChartsSomething had to give and the solution was found in new leadership. The company appointed a new CEO in the beginning of this year. Mike Tuchen was replaced by Christal Bemont.(ex-CEO Mike Tuchen)(New Talend CEO Christal Bemont)Christal Bemont comes from Concur Technologies, which is called SAP Concur since SAP (SAP) acquired it for $8.3B in 2014. She was the CRO or Chief Revenue Officer there. That's the person who's responsible for optimizing revenue growth by aligning all aspects of it: marketing, pricing, customer support, sales... She worked for Concur for 15 years before she joined Talend.Concur is a SaaS company that provides travel and expense management services and it works, amongst many others, with the Department of Defense. Concur's software should bring the DoD's travel system to the 21st century.All in all, ex-Talend-CEO Mike Tuchen, was quite successful at the company since he started in 2013. He brought the company to the stock market in 2016 and before the big fall in the last 18 months, the stock had done very well:Data by YChartsMike Tuchen commented that his departure was not forced upon him and that he stays on the board of directors of Talend for two years. In the search for a CRO, Christal Bemont came into the picture. Since it had been the purpose to appoint a CRO that could transition into the role of CEO and because of the profile of Bemont, Talend decided not to wait, but to make her CEO immediately. Or at least, that is the official explanation. I'm sure quite some frustration about the big slow-down preceded the decision.A good sign is that Bemont was allowed to bring two people from Concur she knows will support her: Ann-Christel Graham becomes CRO and Jamie Kiser becomes CCO or Chief Customer Officer. That creates cohesion and shows the confidence the board places in the new CEO. With a new team, it might be a fresh start for Talend.Concur has quite a good rating on Glassdoor:Talend's ratings are even better:Do you see the 100% CEO approval rate? That is for Christal Bemont already and although it is only based on 3 ratings, which is not abnormal for such a short period, it is a good start.The fact that Bemont has experience in a SaaS company (Concur) is important too. Talend is transforming from on-prem to the cloud. We have seen in the past at, for example, Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK) that this is a messy process with a lot of hiccups and unpredictability. Talend's cloud revenue now accounts for 50% of the revenue. The growth rate of the contribution of the cloud business to the total revenue has slowed down significantly in this quarter, though:(Source: Q4 2019 earnings release deck)The cloud sales have had triple-digit growth rates for 13 quarters before this one and grew 179% in 2019 versus 2020:(Source: Q4 2019 earnings release deck)But because the company didn't split out the numbers for the quarter this time and because revenue contribution of the cloud only accounted for 1% extra versus the last quarter, I think that the really strong string could have been broken.Talend now has 2,250 cloud customers and a total of 4,250 customers, so there is still room to grow and management expects to have $100M in ARR (annual recurring revenue) from the cloud business in Q4 2020. If you still have doubts if the cloud is important to Talend: the word 'cloud' was mentioned 104 times on the Q4 2019 conference call.The dollar-based net expansion rate went down again too, to the lowest point in the last four years: (Source: Q4 2019 earnings release deck).While it is not abnormal that dollar-based retention rates erode a little bit over time, the pace of the deceleration is too fast to be good: from 120% in Q4 2018 to 113% in Q4 2019. After the revenue growth slowdown and the negative free cash flow development this is another bad sign.The bulk of the problems for Talend is in the sales department, I think. The open-source product is good to lure data specialists in and the community that uses Talend is growing and very active on the Talend platform and discussion groups.(Talend community, source)As you can see, there are 555 users online right now (Wednesday afternoon around 5 p.m. EST.) and there are 1155 articles on the community page. There is a whole lot more information too on Talend's website: blog posts, video training, training paths, certification, etc. The company does everything right there.But a product that has such tailwinds because of secular trends towards more big data should grow at a faster rate. As a former CRO, I think Christal Bemont has the right skills to steer the ship in the right direction again.If you look at Talend's price to sales ratio, the stock looks really cheap compared to its software peers:Data by YChartsWe have seen why that is, though. I think that if Bemont can deliver and turn around the ship, the stock could propel higher in a very short period. The product is good but the execution of the company has not been flawless. Bemont hasn't waited to see which way the wind blows. She has already shaken up the sales teams and appointed a new general manager of EMEA. And what she said on the conference call was clear too:That last sentence says a lot, I think. And she's right, there still is a lot of potential left for Talend and I hope that Bemont can convince me to see Talend as a good investment again. I have a small position and I won't sell until Bemont has had a fair chance for change. But she will have to prove for a few quarters that she can bring back growth and sales execution in Talend and before that, I will refrain from buying more shares.Talend's revenue growth has been halved over the past year and its free cash flow went negative. That's not what you want to see as an investor. There are signs that the cloud transition slowed too. Probably because of this, Talend brought in a new CEO in Christal Bemont. With her experience in sales and revenue, she might be the right person for the turnaround of Talend. If she can beat the 12% revenue growth guidance by substantial margins, the stock could take off fast from these levels. But that's the big 'if', of course.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles that look at growth stocks with the long-term in mind, feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4304342,103480,2019-11-08T09:50:10-05:00,"Talend, an infrastructure software vendor, beat Wall Street's expectations for Q3 revenue and earnings.
        Revenue growth is decelerating, but primarily because the company is still executing a shift to longer-term cloud contracts.
        SaaS bookings are up more than 2x y/y, indicating clear momentum for Talend's hosted cloud solutions.
        The stock is trading at under 4x forward revenues, making it one of the cheapest stocks in the software industry.","The markets are at all-time highs again. A fresh volley of positive trade news, lowered interest rates, and strong consumer spending has investors less concerned about a near-term recession. Obviously, this makes bargain-hunting a bit more difficult, and value-conscious investors have to be more tactful about which stocks to buy.In my view, Talend (TLND) is one of the best value plays available in the software sector at the moment. Shares are down about 10% in the year-to-date, and all for the wrong reason in my opinion. Though investors have balked at the company's slowing revenue growth, they've also failed to appreciate the fact that Talend is just now bringing up its cloud division and transitioning its customers to longer-term contracts. As we've abundantly seen with other SaaS names that have embarked on the same transition (like Adobe (ADBE)), the short-term revenue hit from a cloud transition eventually gives way to a stabler and more profitable revenue base.Talend just released third-quarter results that showed massive growth in the company's nascent cloud division. And despite overall beats to Wall Street's top and bottom-line expectations, shares stayed relatively flat.With this in mind, it's a fantastic opportunity for investors to re-assess the bullish case in this stock. Valuation remains the key driver here. At present share prices around $35, Talend trades at a market cap of $1.07 billion. After netting out the $172 million of cash and $127 million of debt on the company's latest balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $1.03 billion. For the following fiscal year (FY20), Wall Street analysts are expecting average revenues of $298.5 million (per Yahoo Finance), representing 21% y/y growth over the $247 million midpoint of Talend's latest full-year guidance outlook of $246.5 to $247.5 million for 2019 (versus a prior wider range of $246-$248 million):Figure 1. Talend guidance updateSource: Talend Q3 earnings deckThis means that Talend is trading at just 3.5x EV/FY20 revenues.A point I made last quarter, which continues to be even more true this quarter as Talend shares have continued to crumble, is that Talend is essentially trading on par with stocks like Dropbox (DBX) and Box (BOX) - both dogs of the software industry that are tearing each other apart with competition. Talend, meanwhile, exhibits similar low-20s revenue growth rates while having a far more differentiated product in the market. I continue to believe in a $49 price target on Talend, implying a ~5x EV/FY20 revenue multiple (still well below most peers in the SaaS sector) and 40% upside from current levels. Once investors' attention turns to strong results in Talend's cloud division, sentiment for the stock should improve.The one key driver that investors new to Talend should be aware about is that the company recently decided to shift its focus to cloud bookings. Though SaaS has caught on with most of the software industry, it's not as common in the infrastructure/backend software space - prime competitor Alteryx (AYX), for example, is still primarily selling extremely high-priced on-prem licenses.This shift to cloud is the primary headwind to Talend's revenues, because large license deals that would have given a strong kick to current-quarter revenues are now being spread across longer intervals of time. So when we look at Talend's results, we have to look at it in the context of the revenue shifting to cloud.Here's a look at the company's third-quarter results:Figure 2. Talend 3Q19 resultsSource: Talend 3Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew 20% y/y to $62.6 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $62.1 million (+19% y/y) by a one-point margin. This revenue growth rate represents two points of deceleration relative to last quarter's 22% y/y growth - but again, cloud is the key driver here. For the thirteenth straight quarter, Talend Cloud notched greater than 100% y/y revenue growth (the difference being that now, the prior-year bases are growing larger, pegging greater significance to the doubling in revenues). In addition, the contribution of cloud bookings as a percentage of total ARR has hit 49%, up six points sequentially and quadruple the year-ago mix:Figure 3. Talend Cloud contribution to total ARRSource: Talend Q3 earnings deckThe company has also continued to grow ARR at a mid-20s pace. It's important to note that Talend's current ARR of $225 million covers about 75% of Wall Street's consensus revenue projection for next year - giving us high confidence in Talend's ability to execute to that target.Figure 4. Talend ARR growthSource: Talend Q3 earnings deckIn addition, management noted that there are now 74 customers with total cloud ARR in excess of $100,000 - more than triple the number of large customers from the year-ago quarter, indicating that Talend is also getting its enterprise customers on board with its SaaS offering. Another key development in the cloud business is that Talend is now available on Microsoft Azure (MSFT), widening the company's sales net.Here's some additional helpful commentary on Talend's cloud progress from CEO Mike Tuchen's prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call (key points highlighted):It's also important to note that Talend is heading the right direction on the profitability front as well. This quarter, Talend pared down its pro forma operating losses to -$2.8 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of -4.4%. In a market that has recently started caring much more about SaaS companies' profitability, that's a highly positive indicator. This also marks a 130bps improvement over 3Q18's pro forma operating margin of -5.7%.Figure 5. Talend operating margin trendsSource: Talend Q3 earnings deckThe company's pro forma EPS of -$0.08 also smashed Wall Street's expectations of -$0.23. Right now, Talend's performance is muddied due to the impacts of a rapid cloud transition and the leaping mix of recurring-revenue bookings versus the large, one-time deals of the past. This optical deceleration is obscuring the fact that Talend is signing on key partnerships (Azure), moving some of its largest enterprise customers into the cloud, and improving its long-term revenue stability and visibility. With a stock trading at just over 3.5x forward revenues, the risk-reward profile in Talend is heavily toward bulls. This is as good a time to buy as any."
4324750,35181,2020-02-17T13:17:18-05:00,"Management makeover results in new CEO, CRO and leadership in Europe.Company is making investments in operations, infrastructure, and R&D.An already high level of cash burn is about to get higher.","My last article on Talend S.A. (NASDAQ:TLND) was published six months ago. Entitled ""Talend: Stay Away This Year"", I gave the company a neutral rating based on excessive cash burn and failure to meet the software Rule of 40. Since publication, Talend's stock price is down 10%.A lot has happened in the last six months, including the issue of convertible senior unsecured notes, change of CEO, a new CRO, and new leadership in Europe. The new management intends to invest more in R&D, operations, and infrastructure.Given the already negative and falling free cash flow margin, so-so revenue growth, and allotting time for the new management to get its legs, I am re-issuing my neutral rating for Talend.The following scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth illustrates Talend's stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. Talend is positioned well below the best-fit line, implying that the stock is very undervalued relative to its peers.The Sales/EV multiple tells me that the stock is undervalued, but my value assessment changes when I substitute next year's earnings estimates for forward sales.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The results shown on this second scatter plot suggest that Talend is actually overvalued based on next year's earnings estimates.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.There are various ways that I could evaluate revenue growth. One way would be to use the growth in Cloud ARR for Q4 which was 129% YoY. I find this figure to be a bit unrealistic considering the total annual revenue growth is 21% and Talend is guiding for 12% growth for the coming year. So despite management's promise of massive cloud growth, I am going to stick with total revenue growth of 21% for the Rule of 40 calculation.(Source: Portfolio123)Talend's free cash flow margin TTM is -7%.(Source: Portfolio123)The free cash flow has been dropping steadily since mid-2017 and I expect a further drop this year based on comments by management in the Q4 2019 earnings call.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40 - some analysts use EBITDA and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the software company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In Talend's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 21% -7% = 14%The calculation comes out below 40%, indicating that the company has work ahead of it in order to balance growth and profits.When a company doesn't meet the Rule of 40, I like to see what its cash burn looks like.If a company doesn't score well on the Rule of 40, then I want to make sure that it is not burning cash. In the case of Talend, the SG&A expense relative to sales is quite high at 97% of the total revenues. The company is spending as much on SG&A as it is taking in with revenues.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)This level of cash burn might be acceptable for an extremely high growth company, but I don't consider 21% revenue growth to be in that category. And let us not forget that company management intends to increase spending for the coming year.Talend is experiencing a slowdown of its on-premises product line and is making a strong effort in transitioning its business to the cloud. With that in mind, the company has acquired a new CEO by the name of Christal Bemont from SAP Concur. She was the CRO at the previous company, and this is her first experience as the CEO of a company. She brings with her a new CRO and chief customer officer. In addition to these changes, there are also several others, mostly in Europe:All of these changes may very well be positive for the company. But we aren't going to see results overnight, and in fact, the changes may very well be detrimental to the short-term performance.Along with the aforementioned managerial changes comes a whirlwind of spending in the name of investing for the future. This spending may very well be justified, but it will increase an already high level of cash burn, much higher than I can justify for a 21% growth company. For these reasons, I am giving Talend a neutral rating."
4291297,20521,2019-09-12T19:38:48-04:00,"Despite Talend's strategic actions, its stock hasn't moved favorably during the last year.Analysts peg the stock decline on the issue of its inability to drive positive free cash flow.For the current year, Talend now expects free cash flow of approximately $15 million negative for the year compared with previous year's $5 million negative.The biggest driver of the increased free cash flow burn is the impact of a shortening contract duration.","According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global cloud integration market is estimated to grow 13.7% annually to $12.24 billion by the year 2022. The growth in the industry is estimated to be driven by the growing demand for tools that can integrate several heterogeneous data sources and the rise of cloud computing that's resulting in the need for effective data integration tools and practices. Open source integration software vendor Talend (NASDAQ:TLND) is a leading player in this market that continues to tap into cloud-based offerings.For the second quarter, Talend's revenues grew 22% over the year to $60.6 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $58.85 million. Net loss was $6.4 million compared to a net loss of $3.6 million a year ago. Adjusted net loss was $0.21 per share, significantly better than the Street's estimated net loss of $0.32 per share.By segment, subscription revenues grew 26% to $52.9 million. Professional services fell 0.5% to $7.7 million.Among other key metrics, annual recurring revenue grew 28% to $218 million. Its dollar-based net expansion rate was 118% at constant currencies, implying that renewing clients are spending more with their refreshed contracts. Cloud revenue more than doubled for the 12th consecutive quarter and accounted for 43% of new ARR. Total customer count exceeded 3,500 this quarter, including more than 1,500 cloud customers. Enterprise customers grew to 525 and generated 68% of its total subscription revenue.For the third quarter, Talend forecast revenues of $61.5-$62.5 million with a loss of $0.25-$0.22 per share. The market was looking for revenues of $63.13 million with a loss of $0.19 per share. Talend expects to end the current year with revenues of $246-$248 million and a loss of $0.98-$0.92 per share. The outlook was weaker than the market's forecast of revenues of $248.45 million and a loss of $0.97 per share.Talend attributed the miss in the outlook to the cautious outlook in the EMEA markets and a short-term impact of continued push into the cloud driven subscription-based model. The transition has resulted in lower professional services revenue.Talend continues to expand its product offerings. Last November it had announced the $60 million acquisition of Stitch, a provider of a self-serve cloud data integration service. Stitch offered a simple, powerful service for developers to help them connect all their data sources from databases, including MongoDB and MySQL, to SaaS tools like Salesforce.com and Zendesk. It replicated the data into the organization's warehouse to allow the developers to provision data to analysts and other team members.Talend already offered a lightweight ETL (extract, transform, and load) for its enterprise-strength ETL tool, but it did not have an entry-level offering like the one that Stitch offered. The acquisition has helped Talend expand its customer base. During the recent management call, Talend acknowledged that Stitch was helping Talend attract new customers and also is becoming a good platform for Talend to upsell its cloud-based products.Talend also has expanded its reach within its ecosystem partners by introducing the Stitch Data Loader on the AWS marketplace. As a new SaaS subscription offering available on AWS Marketplace, Stitch Data Loader will provide an easy way for users to get data into a fast, simple, and secure cloud data warehouse like Amazon Redshift or a cloud data lake like Amazon Simple Storage Service.Talend recently released a new technology alliance program to accelerate cloud data deployments for customers. The program helps provide partners with access to integration toolkits, product licenses for testing and demonstration, marketing assistance and technical and development support. Talend aims to help partners accelerate the creation of value-added data integrations and connectors for customers.Despite Talend's strategic actions, its stock hasn't moved favorably during the last year. Analysts peg the stock decline on the issue of its inability to drive positive free cash flow. For the current year, Talend now expects a free cash flow of approximately $15 million negative for the year compared with previous year's $5 million negative. The biggest driver of the increased free cash flow burn is the impact of a shortening contract duration.Its stock is currently trading at $38.71 with a market cap of $1.2 billion. The stock hit a 52-week low of $31.14 in December last year. Its 52-week high was $73.52 in September last year."
4291535,35181,2019-09-14T03:23:35-04:00,"Talend provides data integration applications and is attempting to convert from on-premises subscriptions to cloud-based SaaS.Stock price is undervalued relative to its peers.Fundamentals are so-so with company failing the Rule of 40% and high level of cash burn.There are other negative factors, including soft sales in Europe, Brexit upcoming, and significant operations in China.","Talend S.A. (TLND) is a company focused on data integration and integrity solutions, both on-premises and in the cloud. Talend’s share price was hit hard last fall along with the rest of the market, but unlike the rest of the market, Talend never recovered. The price chart shows a wedge with a descending upper trend line converging with a support line at approximately $31.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)I expect that the stock price will navigate towards $31 in October, waiting for Brexit or China trade news or perhaps quarterly results. The price will break up if there is positive news (Brexit postponement, China trade negotiations or Quarterly results surprise) or else will break down.As for assigning an investment rating, there are several factors to consider, and most of them are not good. First of all, the share price is quite undervalued relative to its peers. That was the good news.The bad news starts with the company fundamentals. Revenue growth plus free cash flow margin comes up well short of 40%, causing the Rule of 40% to fail.In addition, Talend has a significant level of business in Europe and is already being impacted by the economic slowdown there. Talend will also be affected by Brexit if or when it occurs.The company has significant operations in China and that is a wildcard, given the ongoing trade war, economic slowdown and political climate in general.Finally, according to the Gartner Magic Quadrants, there are four companies that have as good or better product offerings in data quality and data integration. The market is crowded and I'm not sure that Talend has superior products.All in all, I have to give Talend a neutral rating.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 93 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Talend is significantly below the trendline, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is much lower than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Talend is undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.In cases like this, one can usually point to a reason why the stock is undervalued. Talend has French origins and derives a fair amount of revenue from the E.U. and the U.K. Talend management has been warning of a soft European market, particularly with on-premises sales. This is not surprising given the economic conditions in Europe and the upcoming Brexit. I would expect decisions to be deferred by customers and any revenue will be lumpy at best. From the latest quarterly report:SaaS companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40%,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40% is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40% is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate, plus profit, adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40%:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (NYSE:ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40% calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin. Others use the operating cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor's perspective.Talend's revenue grew by 28.2% for the most recent 12 months, down from 42% in January 2018. Keep in mind that Talend implemented the ASC 606 accounting change in 2018 that would affect the recognition of revenue. So, don’t read too much into the trend.(Source: Portfolio123)Talend had a free cash flow margin of -5.3% for the most recent 12-month period, dropping from 2.5% in October 2017. The free cash flow would be affected by the previously mentioned accounting change and also due to the shortened billing cycle as the mix of customers shift from on-premises to the cloud.(Source: Portfolio123)Talend's YoY ARR growth was 28.2%, while free cash flow margin was -5.3%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 28.2% - 5.3% = 22.9%Talend scores fairly low on the Rule of 40%, therefore I have to conclude that the company has a lot of work to make the company financially healthy and bring growth and profits into balance.As an investor, one wants to make sure that if a company doesn't score well on the Rule of 40%, it is at least not burning cash. The company is, in fact, burning cash, and a lot of it.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)In the case of Talend, the SG&A expense is 98% of the total revenues. This means that Talend is spending almost as much on SG&A expenses as total revenue intake.Another way to look at cash burn is to create a scatter plot that shows the operating margin/EV versus forward sales growth for SaaS stocks. The operating margin for my purposes is calculated as follows:Operating Margin = Gross Margin TTM - SG&A Expense Margin TTM(Source: Portfolio123)Talend is situated substantially below the trendline, suggesting that the company’s operating margin (gross profit margin - SG&A expense margin) is way too low for its future growth expectations. The gross margin is reasonable at approximately 76%, so it really comes back to the high SG&A expense.Operations in China – Talend operates an R&D facility in Beijing and the company is considering the possibility of increasing its presence in China. I view this as a significant risk given all that is going on there, including economic slowdown, the trade war with the United States and the political system in general.Currency Fluctuation – Approximately 56% of revenue and 54% of COGS and operating expenses are generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The following statement appears in the quarterly report:Brexit is coming up fast and I am not going to hazard a guess as to which direction the British Pound and Euro head post-Brexit, assuming it is not delayed again. All I am prepared to say is that it is a risk!Gartner Reports – I have two Gartner reports, “Magic Quadrant for Data Quality Tools” and “Magic Quadrant for Data Integration Tools”. Both reports indicate that customers have difficulties with online documentation, migration, and upgrading. Both reports also indicated weakness in technical support or professional services. Within the Magic Quadrant (both use cases), the leader quadrant is crowded and Talend is behind Informatica, SAP SE (SAP), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and SAS.Talend is big into big data. The company is a leader in data integration and data quality, although there are four companies at least as good or better according to the Gartner Magic Quadrants.I find that Talend is not in the best of shape financially. The company fails on the Rule of 40% and has a high level of cash burn. Combine the mediocre fundamentals with business in Europe and operations in China and I can't come up with a compelling reason to consider Talend to be a good investment.The stock is undervalued relative to its peers, but the negatives outweigh this singular positive. Therefore, I give Talend a neutral rating."
4295445,21815,2019-10-07T13:50:56-04:00,"Talend is well established data integration solutions provider, it's in the midst of a cloud transformation. This transformation seems to be going somewhat faster than expected.This produces some headwinds for revenue growth (5%-7%) and cash flow has moved temporarily negative, although not alarmingly so.However, ARR growth should be considered the real measure of growth, which was 29% in constant currency.While mild economic headwinds from Europe might spread, the secular tailwinds are considerably stronger and the shares aren't expensive.","Talend (TLND) the French data integration company, had a good Q2 which made the share price jump. But the shares have fallen back since on the correction in growth stocks and the company's $125M convertible offering. Here is a visual of what they do, from the earnings deck: We have a habit of providing a five year overview:Data by YChartsWhile revenue almost tripled, operationally things have deteriorated quite substantially. At first sight, it isn't surprising the stock price hasn't gone anywhere the last couple of years, despite a top at over twice the current share price a year ago:The company started to build a cloud solution from the ground up years ago and it has taken quite some time (Q2CC):This isn't done yet as they keep on adding features and improvements, but the solution is good enough already for business to shift slowly to the cloud as that is what an increasing number of customers want, from the earnings deck:And indeed the momentum seems to be accelerating (earnings deck):At the end of last year the company had 3000 customers of which 1000 were cloud customers while at the end of Q2 they had 3500 customers of which 1500 were cloud customers.Cloud deals are also getting bigger and are now roughly on a par with on-premise in that respect. This shift has a number of consequences for Talend's results:The effect on on-premise growth is obvious as on-premise customers shift to the cloud and new ones are more likely to start there. On-premise customers are more service intensive so service income growth slows but this produces a positive effect on margins as services earn much lower margins, from the earnings deck:There is another slide which provides interesting information, quantifying the impact of the shift to the cloud on revenue growth for Q3:It turns out this is guided between 5%-7% for Q3, which is pretty substantial, but in Q2 it already had been with a 4% drag from professional services (where 1%-2% was expected). There is also a mild depressive effect on cash flow as cloud contracts tend to be somewhat shorter. However, there is compensation for the slower revenue growth (Q2CC):The somewhat surprising thing is that in the face of the shift to the cloud, the company's on-premise business still keeps growing. While it might not attract net new customers, existing customers actually expand a little over the 118% company wide net dollar expansion rate, so their land and expand seems to work particularly well at their on-premise business.Management expects the on-premise business to keep growing at a low double digit rate in H2 but they do expect the surprisingly high net dollar expansion rate to decline for the on-premise business, one should also keep in mind it's a lagging indicator.The company has several solutions, from the simple onboarding of data which doesn't need specialists (it can be done by 'citizens' as the jargon has it) to the complex (earnings deck):Through development and acquisitions, the company keeps on adding features and functionality which provide up-sell opportunities to existing customers. The company keeps on adding products and solutions (earnings deck):Given the company's 118% net dollar expansion rate (despite some downward pressure from adopting the ASC 606 accounting standard), they are really successful at doing this as well, from the earnings deck:Stitch, which the company acquired late last year served as a great entry point as its customers seem to sign up for other Talend products, and management is now using this as a seeding mechanism (Q2CC):The company's market position is quite well established, given its position as a leader in Forrester (earnings deck):But also by Gartner (earnings deck):From the 10-Q:There are of course a few datapoints which management likes to highlight, which are the following (earnings deck):The standout feature is of course another quarter of triple digit cloud growth, which is now 43% of ARR (annual recurring revenue) on its way to achieve 50% by year-end.The company had a few notable label wins in the quarter, most notably a big biopharmaceutical company which now constitutes their biggest cloud win to date and they replaced Informatica, the dominant on-premise competitor.It's also noteworthy that the results beat expectations by some margin, with EPS coming in at minus $0.21 which was 12 cents better than expectationsFrom the earnings deck:Guidance has been taken down by $2M as a result of a faster shift to the cloud and a slightly bigger deceleration in the growth of on-premise and also because of the economic slowdown in Europe.Data by YChartsNon-GAAP gross margin was 76% in Q2, down 100bp from last year. Operating expenses were up 25% versus last year, as a result of a 49% rise in R&D which is in part the result of the Stitch acquisition.We should also notice that there is quite a large gap between GAAP and non-GAAP operating figures. The GAAP operating loss was $17.9M while its non-GAAP counterpart was a more modest $6.1M. Share based compensation ($10.5M in Q2) explains almost the entire difference with amortization of acquired intangibles ($1.3M) accounting for the rest.Data by YChartsWhile the company eked out a small positive free cash flow ($1.3M) in Q2, for the year a negative figure ($15M) is expected and that's down substantially from previous guidance (which was at minus $5M), mostly due to the shortening of contract duration. From the Q2CC:However, there doesn't seem to be a strong trend in the length of contracts (there is some seasonality at work with Q4 the top), from the earnings deck:The company had $32.1M in cash and equivalents but bolstered this after Q2 closed with a $125 placement of convertible notes. In any case, they should have plenty of cash as they expected to lose $15M this year, mainly due to the shortening of contracts, but that is not likely to deteriorate further. Given the amount of share based compensation the dilution has been pretty modest:Data by YChartsData by YChartsValuation is at an historic low and seems quite modest relative to other SaaS names. However, analysts expect the losses to continue, with EPS estimates of -$0.95 this year rising to -$0.66 in 2020.It's understandable the initial enthusiasm after the Q2 has waned. There is a sharp market correction in growth stocks ongoing, and the company's margins and European outlook are problematic.What's more, the economic rot can spread from Europe to the US and although we think the secular tailwinds (big data, cloud) won't be much affected by that, it might be enough to trouble the outlook further. On the other hand, the shares aren't expensive and the company doesn't really bleed unsustainable amounts of cash. In fact, only this year is the company losing cash due to the shortening in contract length, a result of the shift to the cloud. But this is a temporary effect.Unless we have a serious market correction, we don't see all that much downside as a result and with the growth story intact, one could start accumulating a position on dips."
4320431,102101,2020-01-30T23:09:49-05:00,Talend's revenue is vulnerable to macro volatility.The company has improved its competitive positioning in recent quarters.The risk-reward is tilted towards more upside in the event of a surprise earnings beat.This will result in investors re-calibrating their risk premium.I have an Outperform rating in the near term.,"Source: MarTechTalend (TLND) is playing in a heavily contested cloud ETL (extract, transform, load) space. It is not going to be a cakewalk transition into a subscription-based billing model. Investors should anticipate more volatility, as revenue collection and modeling will be non-linear. Regardless, Talend will pull through, thereby rewarding investors who can hold on to their position. This is going to be a long-term bet on the growing cloud space. Any attempt to predict short-term price action will be tough due to Talend's volatile DNA. I will prefer to acquire a little position and add on further dips if the opportunity presents itself. Talend's future growth path is compelling, and its valuation at 5x P/S TTM isn't too expensive for a competitive cloud play.Source: TalendTalend is an ETL player providing Big Data solutions. It is enjoying double-digit growth in the ETL space. Demand for its products will continue to grow as the company provides more Big Data solutions driven by the global migration of business workloads to cloud platforms. Its recent acquisition of Stitch is an added strength to its competitive positioning when entering RFPs in a space with strong cloud players. Talend is guiding for 21% growth in FY'19. This will be aided by positive secular trends in the cloud space. There is enough tailwind for Talend to beat its near-term growth guidance. As a result, I remain bullish in demand for the company's products in the near term.Talend will have to keep spending on sales and marketing to convince customers to choose it over products offered by big tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), SAP, and Oracle (ORCL). This will continue to impact margins. The company will continue to enjoy strong near-term demand due to the expanding cloud market. However, it needs to keep an eye on its efficiency ratios. Management was upbeat about product demand and revenue growth during the last earnings call. The recent acquisition of Stitch has strengthened its competitive positioning. Its strong partnership with cloud platforms is also attractive, as it helps system integrators do their job better. Talend's continuous transition to a subscription-based billing means gross margin will continue to improve.My biggest concern is the lack of profitability. Talend has cash of $172 million and debt of $154 million (LT debt of $126 million), which means it can meet its short-term obligations. However, margins have to improve in order to reduce cash burn.Talend's future valuation trajectory will be a sine wave of higher lows and higher highs. This is due to its volatile nature. The company is exposed to currency risks in the eurozone, it is a growth stock without profits, there are multiple players in its ETL niche, and it is making a change to its billing method. This means investors will demand a huge risk premium when discounting their valuation cash flow.The Street's forward revenue estimate is conservative at 20%. Talend's improving partnerships with platforms like Azure will expand its cloud TAM (total addressable market).Source: Author Using a DCF model, we can gauge the probability of multiples expansion. Firstly, we assume revenue expands to an 18% market share in 2022 while growing double digits into 2024, which is a bullish estimate. Assuming gross margin improves to 79% (driven by growth in subscription revenue as a % of overall revenue) and changes in working capital grow to 12% of revenue as deferred revenue ramps, the weight will be on SG&A to drive multiples expansion. Talend has to be approaching profitability this year for its multiples to expand significantly. The alternative route is for growth to exceed 20% (analysts' consensus revenue growth estimate in 2021). The competition in the data ingestion space makes this growth projection a 50/50, though it isn't unlikely. Even if it is exceeded, there is a strong chance it will be a function of opex. Another favorable scenario is for investors to lower their risk premium. This will be driven by strong macro tailwinds in the eurozone. The probability of outperforming is 50/50. However, the payoff will be huge given Talend's subdued valuation.Talend's forward revenue growth hovers near the 75th percentile of its peer group; however, its TTM P/S ratio (5x) is around the 50th percentile. Alteryx (AYX), a product peer, trades at a market cap of $8 billion+, while Talend barely trades above the $1 billion mark. Though Alteryx offers more use cases beyond ETL, and it is growing faster than Talend at a better profit margin. This means Talend has the potential to be worth more if it efficiently utilizes the recent capital raise from its debt issuance.Winning in the ETL is not a cakewalk. Gartner doesn't consider Talend a market share leader in the data integration space. Most cloud providers have their ETL solutions. Open source platforms like Talend will have to immensely raise their value proposition to win more market share. They also have to be willing to openly collaborate where necessary. This means their marketing message has to be friendly, with less focus on product superiority and more focus on improving the cloud ecosystem. The overall implication of this is more SG&A spend.Given that management is guiding for growth and investment activities to acquire more market share, Talend's risk is more macro and consumer-driven. Unless the company has sufficient competitive moat (superior pricing power, strong partnerships), investor-specific risks (rise in short interest, increase in daily return volatility) will be triggered. From macro volatility in EMEA, inflexible pricing power due to the level of competition in the ETL space, SaaS transition (non-linearity), to cloud stock volatility, investors should see this as a volatile stock. In the annual risk premium analysis conducted by Aswath Damodaran of NYU, the United States has the best total risk premium after normalizing all the 156 countries in the analysis universe. Talend doesn't enjoy this favorable risk premium because it generates a significant percentage of its revenue in the EMEA region.Though management was positive about the cloud business in Europe during the last earnings call, I find Talend's overall EMEA exposure to be riskier compared to competitors that generate more portion of their revenue in North America. This might force risk-averse value investors to pick the competitors over Talend.The congested ETL space, coupled with Talend's EMEA exposure, doesn't give investors the confidence to lower their risk premium. The company's forward growth guidance and market share pursuit are attractive. Its SaaS transition (often non-linear) is expected to boost gross margin. However, the level of competition in the ETL space, coupled with the added opex needed to sell its brand, will make the gains flowing to the opex line less pronounced. Regardless, I find the valuation attractive at 5x sales, and I'm guiding for the stock to outperform on strong SaaS revenue growth in the near term."
4285469,103480,2019-08-14T10:29:26-04:00,"Shares of Talend have jumped more than 20% after reporting strong Q2 earnings, with investors having expected a steeper revenue decline than Talend actually reported.
        The data integration company has also been migrating a huge amount of its customer base into the cloud, which presents optical near-term headwinds.
        In spite of this cloud migration, Talend's results beat Wall Street's expectations on both the top and bottom line.
        As big data continues to permeate C-level discussions across the Fortune 500, data prep tools like Talend that reduce hours of manual work will become even more necessary.
        Talend trades at an attractive ~4.6x forward revenue valuation.","Talend (TLND), the French software company dedicated to data integration tools that help companies pull together data streams from disparate sources, is enjoying a well-deserved resurgence. After falling sharply at the tail end of last year and in the early portion of 2019, largely due to fears on a global macro slowdown as well as Talend-specific execution concerns as the company shifts into cloud, Talend has proven that its performance was much better than feared - which, in an software sector earnings environment that has recently seen the downfall of many popular names due to ""sales execution issues,"" is a victory in itself.Shares are up more than 20% since the earnings release, though Talend is still approximately flat for the year-to-date:Talend's laggard stock is finally catching up to what I believe is vastly improved performance. The company is executing well in the cloud, having moved 1,500 of its total customer base of 3,500 onto cloud-based contracts. This is a tough switch for many companies, as longtime software investors can attest. Apart from the difficulties of re-working individual customer agreements within the existing installed base, cloud transitions also present challenging optical comps. Lumpy one-time on-premise deals that used to provide an immediate bump in revenues are now spread over multi-month, often multi-year contracts - reducing near-term revenues. But the benefits of cloud are clear, as vendors like Talend can push version updates live to their customer base as well as collect more lifetime billings overall. The slowdown in Talend's growth rates from the mid-30s last year to the high 20s this year can largely be attributed to this cloud transition, plus a few geo-specific headwinds that we're not surprised by. Many companies, most recently including Zendesk (ZEN), have reported a slowdown in Europe, driven in part by increased Brexit uncertainties. With Europe as Talend's home base, this headwind should come as no surprise - but the key point is, there are no Talend-specific sales issues driving the growth deceleration that we should be concerned about, and sales should pick up steam once macro headwinds subside. Despite the fact that we have strong explanations behind Talend's growth deceleration, the stock remains well below 2018 highs above $60, and Talend's valuation remains incredibly modest - even after the stock's post-earnings jump. At current share prices around $38, Talend has a market cap of $1.17 billion. After we net off the $32.1 million of cash and minor $0.8 million of debt on Talend's balance sheet, we are left with an enterprise value of $1.14 billion.Here's how that stacks up to Talend's latest guidance ranges:Figure 1. Talend FY19 guidance updateSource: Talend 2Q19 earnings releaseNote that Talend took down its guidance to $246-$248 million this quarter (+21% y/y) versus a prior view of $248-$250 million (+22% y/y) last quarter, but due to the fact that much of it is cloud-related, investors still took the update as positive. Here's the background from CFO Adam Meister's prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:Regardless, against Talend's latest guidance ranges, the company trades at a fairly modest 4.6x EV/FY19 revenues. Here's how that compares against other SaaS companies in the ~20-30% y/y growth bucket:The only outlier here is Dropbox (DBX), which has noted its own competition-driven sales issues. In my view, Talend is worth at least 6x EV/FY revenues, implying a price target of $49 and 28% upside from current levels. Buy Talend on its momentum and ride it higher. Let's now dive deeper into Talend's second-quarter results and the key drivers behind its beat:Figure 2. Talend 2Q19 resultsSource: Talend 2Q19 earnings releaseAs seen in the table above, revenues grew 22% y/y to $60.6 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $59.3 million (+19% y/y) by a solid three-point margin. This represents two points of deceleration relative to Q1's growth rate of 24% y/y, which as previously noted can be attributed to both a greater mix of cloud bookings and a more-or-less expected slowdown in Europe. What we want to focus on, irrespective of cloud-driven revenue noise, is the progress that Talend has made in its cloud conversions. In Q2, Talend drove 28% y/y growth in annualized recurring revenue to $218 million, on par with last quarter's growth rate:Figure 3. Talend ARR trendsSource: Talend Q2 earnings deckWe also note that as a percentage of new ARR bookings, cloud rose to 43% - up seven points from last quarter, and more than double from the rates seen last year. CEO Mike Tuchen also noted that Talend Cloud has grown at greater than 100% y/y for the past consecutive twelve quarters, which is a massive accomplishment that also speaks to how low Talend's cloud mix used to be.Figure 4. Talend cloud percentage of ARRSource: Talend Q2 earnings deckIt's not difficult to understand that with cloud bookings taking on this rapid pace, revenues will see a clear push-out from near-term quarters to future periods. Talend noted that it also benefited from strong enterprise adoption, with total enterprise customers over $100,000 in ARR growing 23% y/y to 525 customers. Within the existing installed base, Talend also continued its trend of strong upsells - as measured by 118% net expansion rates, on par with Q1.The second driver behind revenue growth declines, of course, is Europe-related slowdown - which can be felt across the software industry. Talend took this weakness into its updated guidance range, but management still feels confident about hitting its near-term and longer-term targets, citing industry tailwinds that are powerful offsets to macro weakness. Per the CEO's comments on the Q2 earnings call:Talend's top-line beats also translated well into several bottom-line highlights. Talend's pro forma EPS of -$0.21 handily beat Wall Street's expectations on -$0.32. In addition, the company improved a cash flow loss in the year-ago quarter to an FCF profit of $1.34 million this quarter, reversing a weakening trend from Q1:Figure 5. Talend FCFSource: Talend 2Q19 earnings releaseTalend remains one of the few value plays in the software sector. Its valuation was hammered last year due to fears of a rapid deceleration; this year, however, Talend has produced the cloud conversion results that largely justify the slowdown in its top-line growth rates. In spite of this, shares of Talend have hardly recovered to 2018 levels. Stay long here and buy Talend while it's still cheap."

The market is expected to grow (Markets and markets):Or, from Hitz Diaries:And Fortune Business Insights:But Talend, despite being slowed down by its move to the cloud, is still growing faster than the market, even if the growth rate is half that of a couple of years ago:Data by YChartsThere are three reasons why that 20.3% growth is an underestimation:From the earnings deck:A few additional data points illustrate this:From these figures it will be clear that the cloud is where it is happening for the company, so we'll turn to that.The cloud part of the data integration market is growing faster than the overall market, from the earnings deck:That 31% projected CAGR is double that of the overall data integration market, so it's no wonder the company sees the cloud as a prime imperative, here is management (Q3CC):There are a number of issues for the company here:Revenue recognition from on-premise and cloud businesses differ, from the 10-K:But in the end, it doesn't make a huge difference as the up-front part of the on-premise contracts is only some 10% of the contract value (resulting from the adoption of ASC 606), with the technical support rateable of the contract duration, from the 10-K:The migration of its on-premise customers is starting, from the Q3CC:The cloud expansion rate doesn't even include any conversions from on-premise; including these would increase the expansion rate further.The company has introduced a solution to automate migrations from on-premise to popular Snowflake cloud data warehouses and the availability of Talend Cloud on Microsoft (MSFT) Azure. Talend is ready for a host of different client configurations, from the earnings deck:So while its cloud business is growing rapidly, it's coming at least in part at the expense of its on-premise business, it's almost half of new ARR (earnings deck):But because of the greater contribution of channel partners and reduced demands on professional services, the net effect is somewhat lower overall growth, at least for a while. At some point this is likely to reverse as the overall cloud business becomes bigger and its stronger growth and higher expansion rates start to overtake these negative transition effects.Q3 was actually strong with a small revenue beat and non-GAAP EPS coming in $0.15 better than expected at -$0.08.Its professional services grew just 1% y/y in Q3, which is the result of the shift to the cloud discussed above.From the earnings deck:Data by YChartsThe GAAP operating margin remains well in negative territory even if its non-GAAP equivalent is much less dramatic at -4% in Q3, a 2% point improvement from a year ago. But there is still little sign of operational leverage kicking in.Data by YChartsA little more worrying is that cash flows have turned negative again (Q3CC):The cash flow is negatively impacted by the shift to the cloud, which eliminates the up-front license part, but this effect isn't huge as we have seen above.The company can sustain this rate of cash bleed for years with cash and equivalents at a comfortable $172M at the end of Q3, thanks to a convertible note offering in September which brought in a net $149M.Dilution hasn't been substantial but share-based compensation has taken off last year:Data by YChartsData by YChartsWith a guided $247M (midpoint) of revenue in 2019, a market cap of $1.11B and net cash of $45M, its 2019 EV/S is roughly 4.3 and assuming 20% revenue growth in 2020, this falls to 3.5 next year.With the shares really quite reasonably priced and growth somewhat hampered by the transition effects of the shift to the cloud, we think that the shares are actually a reasonable buy here.Keep in mind that the company isn't profitable and still displays little signs of operational leverage, and cash bleed has increased this year. On the other hand, while transition effect might dominate its headline business for now, ultimately the shift to the cloud is a considerable net benefit."

I have included Talend in my Potential Multibaggers and wrote an article about this underfollowed stock last month too, in which I claimed that the story is much more compelling than it looks at first sight. With the earnings, investors seemed to realize this too. I think, though, that despite the 18% jump, there is plenty of upside left for the French big data company. (Source)The big dropTalend's stock price has seen a huge drop from its all-time highs:Data by YChartsWhile the stock was up 18% today, the stock is, at $38, still more than 50% under its all-time high from September 2018. I believe that the stock can return to this point and surpass it, but of course, the stock market is unpredictable and you never know when. After all, Talend is still unprofitable and then investors look at one thing and one thing only: growth. Talend still has that growth, but it is masked.The reason that the stock has dropped so much is that Talend is in full transition from on-premise to the cloud. The on-premise business goes down faster than Talend had expected. While this certainly is great for its cloud-adoption, the clients tended to start smaller on the cloud than on-premise. Part of the reason that investors bid the price of Talend's stock up 18% is that the cloud transition is starting to have momentum. CEO Mike Tuchen on the Q2 2019 conference call:But the company also warned investors that the transition is not over yet and that it will still have an impact on the revenue growth. CFO Adam Meister on the Q2 2019 conference call:First the raw numbers. Talend's Q2 Non-GAAP EPS came in at -$0.21, beating estimates by $0.12. These non-GAAP earnings don't include stock-based compensation and acquisition costs. These results were much better than investors expected because in May, when Talend announced its Q1 2019 results, it had guided for a net loss per share of $0.35 to $0.31.While the GAAP EPS missed by $0.07, coming in at -$0.60, the most important measure for growth SaaS companies are non-GAAP numbers and revenue. Revenue was up by 21.8% to $60.59M, beating estimates by $1.26M. Just $60.59M of revenue, because, mind you, this is a company with a market cap of just below $1B.You wouldn't expect it if you see the enthusiasm for Talend's stock today, but the company actually lowered its FY 2019 revenue prospects, after it had already lowered them last quarter as well. This time it lowered prospects by $2M, guiding for a revenue range of $246M to $248M. Management attributed this small adjustment to a combination of several factors. The most important one is actually positive: faster adoption of the recurring sales model, which is of course what investors want to see. The unfavorable currency exchange (the strong dollar) and (as a result of the transition to the cloud) a slowdown in its services revenue. Talend's CFO Adam Meister explained that on the Q2 2019 conference call:While it is never good to have a flat revenue YoY, I think that in this case it's actually a good sign, since it signals the transition to the cloud model.Talend's ARR or annual recurring revenue grew by 29% on a constant currency basis, while subscriptions revenue went up by 30% at a constant currency basis.A very important metric for any SaaS company is the dollar-based net expansion rate. Essentially, this means: how much of the spending of its customers can the company keep? Ideally, you want to see this number well into the 90s or higher. For Talend, the dollar-based net expansion rate came in at 118% at a constant currency basis. And this is not an outlier for Talend. This graph shows its dollar-based net expansion rate numbers over the last years:(Source: Q2 2019 earnings slides)Also very important: for the 12th consecutive quarter, Talend's Cloud revenue grew by more than 100%. 43% of the new annual recurring revenue now comes from the Talend Cloud. This is projected to be 50% at the end of 2019:(Source: Q2 2019 earnings slides)I also want to highlight another important quote from CFO Adam Meister on the Q2 2019 conference call: :Talend has gathered quite a lot of impressive customers by now. These big companies won't hesitate to keep expanding their spending if Talend keeps delivering value for them. Here is a selection of the clients:(Source: Q2 2019 earnings slides)Geographically, Europe was a bit weaker, with just 14% growth YoY. Adam Meister cited the macroeconomic backdrop as a reason, but I think that the adoption of GDPR has had its influence too. Last year, when GDPR was implemented, this was a boost to the revenue. Now that most has been implemented, the revenue grows less fast. Management stays cautious on EMEA for the remainder of 2019.Talend handles big data and it sees data as the new competitive advantage for companies:(Source: Q2 2019 earnings slides)Talend is proud that it is a leader in several domains. One is big data fabric wave:(Source: Q2 2019 earnings slides)It's also a leader in data integration tools, recognized in Gartner's (IT) magic Quadrant:(Source: Q2 2019 earnings slides, highlight FGTV)And Talend is also recognized as a leader in data quality by Gartner:(Source: Q2 2019 earnings slides, highlight FGTV)While these recognitions on themselves don't mean all that much, they are important for a company. Their technology is recognized as very valuable by an objective source and therefore it can help the company to land customers. After all, the magic quadrants are quite known, also by those who have the key to sign the contracts. So this can only be a tailwind.While Talend has surged more than 18%, the company is still very moderately valued, especially compared to a lot of other SaaS companies. This is its P/S ratio:Data by YChartsAt just 5, it is very low compared to other SaaS companies and also to its own P/S ratio historically. Another metric that is often used to asses the stocks of SaaS companies is EV/S. Here too, Talend scores a very low (cheap) number:Data by YChartsTalend had good results and surged more than 18%. The transition to the cloud model has made investors pessimistic over the last year because of the slowing revenue due to the transition. But this migration to the cloud will be very positive over the long term for Talend. The fact that the on-premise revenue falls faster than management had foreseen is just a sign that the shift to the cloud goes faster than foreseen. As long as Talend Cloud keeps growing at a pace of 100% and more YoY and the dollar-based net expansion rate stays well above 115%, you can only conclude that Talend is executing as it should and I believe it will eventually return to and surpass its all-time high of $73.51. At $38, that means there is still 100% upside.If you have enjoyed this article and you don't want to miss other articles about growth stocks written with the long term in mind, feel free to hit the follow button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4243753,100666,2019-02-25T04:54:20-05:00,"This is the 8th stock I picked in the Potential Multibaggers series.Talend is in the sweet spot of a present and future trend: big data processing.Talend's market cap is just a bit above $1B, so it has lots of opportunity to grow into a tenbagger.The recent price drop provides an opportunity for long-term investors, especially because the main reason for the drop (a switch to the cloud) will continue in 2019.","In my article about why you should have growth stocks in your portfolio, I wrote about how my growth stock strategy works. The principles are more qualitative than quantitative and I think that is appropriate for growth stocks. A lot of them are highly scalable and quantitative ratios do not tend to find the winners. Amazon (AMZN) has never been a buy if you looked at quantitative ratios, and neither were Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA) or almost all other growth stocks. For people who are not convinced: Yahoo! would have won over Alphabet/Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) any time if you would have looked at measurable ratios. But we all know who has won.The basic philosophy is that stocks can only go down by 100%, but they can go up by 1000s of percentages. A few big winners are more than enough to compensate for quite a few losers and make you outperform versus the market. Of course, because these are growth stocks and not megacaps, the stocks in the portfolio of Potential Multibaggers will be quite volatile by nature. You should have the stomach to sit out the big swings and concentrate on the only period that matters for investing: the very long term.In the articles in this series, I pick stocks that I believe have the potential to become multibaggers over the course of years. These are no short-term plays, but stocks to hold in your portfolio for decades. All of them have the potential to be tenbaggers or more.I am in the process of writing an article about the results of the Potential Multibagger picks. I can already reveal that the theory works with the seven previous picks, although there are a few huge losers. The first stock I picked in this series was Shopify (SHOP), and the second stock was its Chinese equivalent Baozun (BZUN). The third pick, Momo (MOMO), has been all over the place since the article has come out.The fourth stock I picked was another Chinese ADR: Ctrip (CTRP), the Chinese equivalent to Bookings (BKNG). The fifth pick has drawn the most attention of all the Potential Multibaggers: JD.com (JD). Another Chinese stock I added was Weibo (WB), which I picked in September 2018. The last Potential Multibagger I had picked so far was Okta (OKTA), which I wrote about in December 2018.Just to assure my readers, I don't think that the outlook for any of the previous picks has changed for the long term, and there is no reason to sell any of the stocks as of now. I still have them all in my portfolio as well. I have averaged up in Baozun and Shopify when big drops occurred along the way and averaged down in Momo, Weibo and JD.com several times.I have not added to Ctrip, because its growth has stalled somewhat and in a previous article I pointed at three problems, but I may look at it again in the near future because of the substantial drop that could make it interesting again. I would still recommend all six others for new investors who have a long-term investing horizon of more than a decade.One of the strange things about the Potential Multibaggers is that it only holds one American company so far: Okta. All the rest is Chinese (JD.com, Weibo, Baozun, Ctrp and Momo) and Canadian (Shopify). This eighth installment is again about a foreign stock: Talend (TLND), which has French origins.(Source)Talend made its IPO on the Nasdaq on July 29, 2016. This is what the stock has done since then:Data by YChartsAs you can see, the stock has done very well in general (up 82%), but it has seen a lot of volatility too. It was up 180% just a few months ago. So that behavior already suits a Potential Multibagger, but of course, that is not nearly enough to become a full-fledged Potential Multibagger.In my series of Potential Multibaggers, I choose stocks that have a smaller market cap. I want to see the potential for a tenbagger in the (distant) future. Talend's market cap is about $1.16B (according to finviz.com) at the moment of writing, and yes, I think a valuation of around $12B somewhere in the distant future is perfectly feasible (and then some).Talend is in a sweet spot of the growing internet and connected nets business: big data. Talend has developed Talend Data Fabric, a software platform that integrates data and apps in real time across big data and cloud environments and traditional systems. The company also provides technical support, and consulting and training. The software platform is both sold through Talend's own sales force and resellers.This graph, taken from the company's website, shows schematically what Talend does:Talend was founded in 2005 and is based in Suresnes, France, a suburb of Paris. More about that later.There is of course much more to know about all the operations of Talend. I will simplify the story of Talend below, but diving too much into technical details would be beyond the scope of this article. I have written multiple articles about my other Potential Multibaggers as follow-up articles and I intend to do that for Talend too. In those articles, I dive deeper into the business. You could see this article as some sort of first acquaintance, a start for your own due diligence.For my Potential Multibaggers, I have a set of qualities that I look for. Let's look if Talend has got the qualities of a Potential Multibagger.Now, this may seem petty, but companies that have ideas that they can articulate well and make investors enthusiastic about will probably have the same conviction in trying to win their customers. It is always great if you can summarize what the company does in one sentence that everybody understands. For Talend, this may not be so simple on first sight for the non-techies, but actually, you have to see through the cloud(s) (pun intended).Every growth investor and his little sister knows that big data is the place to be for a lot of tech companies. 82% of companies and non-profits have applied or want to apply big data technology to their HR. In the past, a lot of HR data were not used or only used for some boring presentation that stayed within a small circle within the company. With big data, companies can gain valuable insights from their data. There are numerous examples: predict when employees might leave, how to attract the most valuable candidates, where to find the most valuable candidates, what the perfect background is, how to keep employees happy and motivated, etc. And that is just for HR.Of course, with a huge amount of data, you need software to automatically scan the data for the most valuable trends in those data. That is where Talend can come in. The data get bigger, but the IT capabilities cannot follow:(Source: Talend website)And this is just one example of the corporate use of big data. How about the enormous amount of data of devices connected through the Internet of Things (IoT)? Or the data of customers: which customers are easier to convince to upsell? How to keep them as customers? There is an enormous amount of data that can give valuable insights if you have the right software to comb through them.(Source: Talend.com)Now, big data analysis is not the only market Talend works in, but to me it is the most exciting. This is the overview of the products of Talend, which all have to do with data and integration of data:(Source)Talend also has a community, some sort of chatroom/forum, which is very active. I think this really is an advantage. An online community makes the ties stronger and makes you belong to something, which makes the conviction higher for key decision makers and you don't leave the community that easily. Here is a snapshot of Talend's community page:(Source)While a community is often more a feature of smaller businesses, Talend is a big player in the big data sector. The company proudly presents on its website:(Source)This is quite remarkable: Talend has both the strongest strategy and the strongest current offering, according to this investigation. This looks very promising.Talend already has a few big clients too. Euronext (OTCPK:EUXTF), which controls the equity and derivatives markets in the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Portugal, is one of Talend's clients.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) is another client:(Source)One of the most valuable aspects of growth stocks is having a visionary leader, someone with exceptional qualities who knows where he or she has to steer his or her company to surf the wave to the future. I especially, but not exclusively, like founder CEOs, since they have had the drive and the capacities to start something and to make their baby big. Another great asset is if they are great communicators since they can probably bring their message across both to the (financial) media and their team.Talend's CEO is Mike Tuchen, but he was not the founder of Talend. Talend is a special case. Its HQs are in Redwood City, California. That is in the middle of Silicon Valley and, for example, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is located there too.But Talend is actually a French company, only the third to be listed on the Nasdaq. It was founded in 2006 by Fabrice Bonan and Bertrand Diard. Diard was the founder of data analytics company Business Objects, which was acquired by SAP (SAP). Bonan is still on board: he is Chief Product Officer and Member of the Board. Diard was Chief Strategy Officer until February 2017, but is a more restless soul and serial entrepreneur. He moved on to Serena Capital (VC) as a venture partner. But he also co-founded Influans, which was bought again, this time by Ogury. Influans makes personalized marketing. Diard was CEO of Talend from 2005 to 2013, when the present CEO Mike Tuchen took over.While I like founder-CEOs, the fact that one of the co-founders is still aboard gives me confidence too. And I think CEO Mike Tuchen is an excellent one.(Mike Tuchen, source)In my article about Okta, I wrote about Okta's CEO Todd McKinnon who was the 14th fittest man on earth in 2017 in the 45-to-49 age group. He earned that in the annual CrossFit Games, an event of in total four days. Elite athletes from around the world participate in this prestigious event.While Mike Tuchen is not of the level of Todd McKinnon, he actually has spoken out about sports too. He says that rowing in college made him a leader. He also loves race bikes:(Mike Tuchen, CEO of Talend)What I also like about Mike Tuchen is that he started as an electrical engineer designing computer chips, so he knows the business from bottom to top, which becomes rarer these days. He also went to Harvard business school and later studied marketing, product management and general management. I think this gives him enough credibility in his position.This might sound strange to some, but I also like to look a CEO into the eye before I buy a stock. Before you think that I have a whole network of top executives as my closest friends (I wish!): on a screen is good enough for me. If I see how CEOs communicate to the press, I often get a better idea of how they are as a leader of the company I invest in.For Mike Tuchen, you can find several interviews on the web. I think this short interview with Jim Cramer is a good one to start because Tuchen is able to explain in simple terms what Talend does and why it is not afraid of the big fish in the pond. Tuchen comes across as very competent, passionate, patient and as someone who knows the ins and outs of his business and industry. Exactly what I like to see in CEOs of my Potential Multibaggers.A growth stock must be innovating. If the company doesn't innovate, it won't have growth. The Austrian-American economist Joseph Schumpeter, one of the most influential economists ever, coined the term ""creative destruction"" in 1942. In ""Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy,"" he defined it as the:In a 2013 Goldman Sachs survey, the strong correlation between R&D and sales growth and stock price performance was shown:(Source: Businessinsider.com)We take a quote here from Talend's Q4 2018 earnings call:That is the evolution I want to see: 37% growth YoY. The reason that is quoted is the transition to the cloud, which is one of the reasons for the fall of Talend's stock price before the last earnings. You can read more about this in the excellent articles of two fellow-Seeking Alpha contributors I highly recommend to follow if you don't do that yet:Bert Hochfeld's article Talend - Time For An Updated LookShareholders United's article Talend Crashed On Cloud TransitionWhether I pick dividend stocks or growth stocks, I don't change my strategy: I buy stocks for the long road. Mostly I'm a buy-and-hold investor. In my bio here on SA, there is the sentence that I think qualifies me very well: I don't think in years but rather in decades.As a consequence, I pick stocks of companies that have a vision for the future and that I believe will thrive over the next decade. I know that predicting is hard, especially about the future, but what I mean is: I want the company in the sweet spot of what I think is a new evolution in a market or submarket, preferably, of course, a secular trend.Talend is certainly such a stock. It invests in software that matters in big data. And there is certainly a global secular trend towards more data and more computerized analysis of the data. This trend will certainly grow stronger over the next years and probably decades as more and more 'things' will be connected to the internet (Internet of Things). All those little devices will let data explode, so there will be needed software to deal with the data. And that is where Talend comes in. Mike Tuchen said on the Q4 and FY 2018 earnings call:And also:I want double-digit growth over the next five years because otherwise, it is impossible to evolve from a Potential Multibagger to a real multibagger. Because Talend is in a transition from on-premises to the cloud, it is not so easy to analyze its longer-term growth. Finviz.com expects 30% EPS growth over the next five years. This is the expectation that simplywall.st gives:As you can see from the graph, Talend's revenue is expected to grow exponentially over the next few years - from $204M at the end of 2018 to $505M in 2023. But this is on the basis of just one analyst and I think it might be conservative. The reason I think this is because Talend has the ARR formula, one of the magic terms in software: Annual Recurring Revenue. That is basically the subscription model we all know. It is an extremely powerful and sticky product. Just ask Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN). ARR is a killer because it is so steady, reliable and gives a great pricing power. Talend got $198.1M in ARR in 2018, a growth of 33% YoY.This is the last point on the checklist for potential multibaggers. Stocks that want to be picked as a potential multibagger should have as much as possible of what I call the three Os: overachieving, owning, and overdelivering.OverachievingA quote again from Mike Tuchen, from the Q4 2018 earnings call:In other words: come here, IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle. We want to fight you, we want to take your customers away from you. Move over! That is overachieving as I like it.OwningI like executives that have skin in the game. If the stock does well, they will do well financially too. Their interests and that of the stockholder are aligned. According to finviz.com, management owns 2.3% of the shares outstanding. With the current market cap of $1.16B, 2.3% represents around $27M. That is substantial ownership in my book. Management knows that if the company grows a lot, their own shares will be worth much more too.OverdeliveringIf you look at the growth in the stock price of Talend, I surely would say that this is over-delivering already. Here is again the graph since the IPO compared to the S&P 500:Data by YChartsI have stated several times, though, that the stock price doesn't tell anything on its own. It is just a barometer of the stock market's sentiment, but doesn't always tell you that much about the company behind the stock. You can read more about this in my previous article, 7 Suggestions For When Your Stocks Fall.At this moment, Talend's stock price has fallen considerably. The two main reasons are the transition to the cloud, which is inevitable and good for the long term, and a few accounting matters that impact the numbers over the next year. Investors saw an outlook of just 20% growth and panicked, but in the earnings deck, they should have looked at this:The FX impact can be positive or negative. For 2019, it is expected to be negative. The following years it might be positive, who knows. The slowdown because of the cloud shift has both impact on its own and on the PS (professional services), but both will go away over the years:'That number' is retention. That is at 120%. There is no split-up, but it could mean that all customers stayed and added 20% to their products dollars or there was some churn, but existing customers even paid more than 20% extra. No matter how you look at it, this is an impressive achievement.As I have already mentioned a few times, Talend's stock price has fallen quite a bit on temporary issues while the company makes the change it has to make by putting everything on the cloud. That and an accounting matter with an impact of a few percentages makes the growth rate of Talend optically lower ('just' 21%). This will have an impact for 2019 and maybe even a bit beyond that. That is an opportunity, in my opinion, for the smart investor to accumulate Talend's shares over the course of the next few months.With a P/S ratio of 6, Talend is certainly not expensive for a high-growth stock. Just to compare: Okta stands at 26, Zscaler (ZS) at 28.5, Alteryx (AYX) and Atlassian (TEAM) at 24. That doesn't mean I don't like these stocks (I really do!), but Talend has the same potential for scaling and high-profit margins over the long term, so its P/S ratio of 6 seems to derisk the stock a bit.What is most important is that Talend is a leader in its market and that that market is growing at neck-breaking speed.What I do in such cases is start with a small position and build it out over time. That gives you the opportunity to limit the risk. If the company keeps delivering, the price will keep rising and you have your cheap shares to lower your average price. If the markets fall, you can average down. In any case, if you invest in stocks like Talend (and actually all of the Potential Multibaggers), you really should have a long-term vision.I think Talend might be a Potential Multibagger over the next few years. I have added it to my personal portfolio after the sharp drop. My initial cost base was $37.75. My position is still relatively small and I want to build it out over the next years, patiently and critically.I want to stress for the last time that with these high-growth companies, you should always be prepared for high volatility, as Momo's, JD's and Baozun's stock prices have already demonstrated multiple times now. The same could happen (again) to Talend.But as long as you keep your eyes on the road, mostly they are greatly rewarding over the long run, and as a group, I expect them to outperform the S&P index, potentially by a wide margin. As long as you hold them for the long term, they might become life-altering stocks in your portfolio. But keep in mind that it is always better to have several of these Potential Multibaggers in your portfolio to spread the risk.This was the eighth installment of the Potential Multibaggers series.

4240928,98236,2019-02-14T08:31:57-05:00,"Talend has become a value stock despite an undimmed growth outlook.
        Talend's transition to the cloud is ahead of schedule.
        The transition to the cloud is really a good thing, and the growth rate percentage for the business will climb back to prior levels I believe.
        Talend remains a leader in the data integration space and the data integration space remains a key enabling technology for most digital transformation undertakings.
        The company will report on Thursday although top line metrics, which were quite positive, have already been pre-released.","I think it is fair to say that Talend (TLND) has been one of the more disappointing names in the IT space over the past year in terms of its share price performance-and perhaps its operational outlook as well. The company started the 2018 firmly in hyper-growth mode-it reported Q4 2017 revenue growth of 36%. It forecast full year 2018 growth of 36%. It appears at this point as though it will meet that target-but at this point, based on analyst inference of company commentary on its cloud transition, the First Call consensus for forward growth is down to just 21.5% for this current year of 2019. In turn, that kind of contraction to expected growth expectations, has led to a very poor share price performance for Talend since late September. Many stocks fell after late September, but most IT names have recovered. That has not been the case for Talend shares which currently sit at less than $37.50 down almost 50% from their high and essentially unchanged over the past year as well as the past several weeks, a period that has seen a very sharp rally in most enterprise IT names.I last wrote about Talend for Seeking Alpha more than 18 months ago. I was reasonably enthusiastic about the company and its shares back then, but basically have ignored it since that point. I can’t claim prescience-just other potential investments attracted me to a greater degree. But I think now is a reasonable time to revisit this name when much bad news concerning the company’s transition to the cloud has been announced and is now baked into the company’s valuation. Talend is still a leader in data integration-according to some market research firms it is in 2nd place behind Informatica, a legacy vendor whose solutions are thought to be somewhat expensive with fewer of the more modern features users are looking for.Should readers buy Talend shares? Is the company’s transition to the cloud a high-risk or lower risk undertaking? Does the company’s current valuation make up for its risk? Will the transition restore this company to the kind of growth it enjoyed prior to the end of the 2018? I think betting on Talend shares at this point presents readers with a reasonable level of risk/reward. To a certain extent, the company apparently made a mistake in setting its priorities and its timetable in transitioning to the cloud. It is hardly the only company to have made that error.Because of its valuation-with a current EV/S of around 4X based on my estimate of 2019 revenues of less than $260 million, it will not have to be entirely successful in terms of accomplishing all of its go-to-market objectives exactly on schedule for the shares to work. Is Talend my favorite name in the IT firmament these days? Obviously not, but that will not prevent the shares from staging a reasonable recovery and generating positive alpha in the balance of 2019. Readers to whom our work appeals come in all sizes and flavors, and so do appropriate investments. Talend is not the traditional high-growth, highly valued name that we often write about. In fact, readers today confront a very bifurcated valuation paradigm in which the strongest companies with the highest growth rates, including the likes of Twilio (TWLO) Elastic (ESTC) and MongoDB (MDB) are well recognized at this point, and valued accordingly. While growth of those names is likely to remain so rapid as to take care of valuation excesses in short order, there may be periods of share price consolidation-and I would hardly be surprised to see such a period over the next 90 days after the exceptional performance of most high growth shares since December 24th.On the other hand, there are companies such as Talend, who have made a misstep (or what appears to be a misstep) and have paid for it dearly in their valuation. Talend, for a variety of reasons, is never likely to return to 40%+ top line growth again. But one can make a reasonable case for the shares without trying to suggest a future for the company that is unlikely to be realized. The data integration space is one that will remain important for users for the foreseeable future. Talend has some unique competitive features that make its solutions of greater ease of use than legacy solutions offered by Informatica and other vendors. And it remains independent, and able to offer users more choice than its rival MuleSoft, now a part of the Salesforce (CRM) platform.At this point Talend shares have fallen to a valuation far less than that of other companies with comparable growth metrics. The EV/S based on 2019 sales growth of 25% has fallen to just over 4X. The average EV/S for a 25% growth rate is just less than 7X-based on my compilation of estimates and valuation. Recollect that Salesforce (CRM) paid no less than 16.5X revenue for Talend’s most relevant rival, MuleSoft less than a year ago. Salesforce has claimed that the acquisition has achieved the level of revenue synergies necessary to justify the purchase price-presumably other competitors in the space can see the same opportunity..As of this writing on 2/11, the average price target for the shares as reflected by the First Call consensus is greater than $58, almost 57% above the company’s current share price-and that includes one price target of $38 by the analyst at JPMC. Talend is not covered by many analysts-just 8 at this point and most of them have buys on the name. In the last month or so, two of the 8 analysts have increased their estimates both for the year and the quarter. The analyst at JPMC, Mark Murphy has had a consistently negative view of the company, and lowered his price target when the company pre-announced its Q4-not because of fundamentals but because of his belief that investor sentiment would worsen due to the departure of the head of sales. So far that has played out-but realistically, investor sentiment is like quicksilver, and at this point, it will not take all that much to turn sentiment in a different direction.Talend is going to report the results of its fiscal year operations in just a few days-although it actually pre-announced some results in the wake of the departure of its head of sales back in early January. I want to stress at the outset of this article that I have no informational advantage regarding what it will report beyond its pre-announcement-and of more importance, perhaps, what it is going to guide. The pre-announcement featured an upside in terms of license revenue growth and the cadence of the transition to cloud-based offerings offset by a negative surprise in terms of professional services revenues. Objectively, that is a positive attainment as the factors involved in the professional services results are one-time in nature and have little to do with the future of the company. The better performance on subscription is perhaps an early sign that the company’s transition to the cloud is coming along ahead of expectations.Since the time of the January preannouncement, as mentioned, a couple of analysts have increased their estimates somewhat, for the company’s future operational performance. I assume that these increased estimates must have been with some reference to expectations presented to the analysts by the company-if not explicitly, then through body language or 3rd party contacts. I can say, without much fear of contradiction, that the share price as it is, reflects no expectation of any substantial positive performance or forecast. Thus, I think the earnings event on Thursday, other than it is on Valentine’s Day and perhaps an inconvenience to some, is not likely to be a negative event.Talend’s raison d’etre has been to offer users a more modern set of tools to allow for seamless data integration. I don’t know that data integration is more important now than might have been the case a decade ago-how does one measure the degree of importance-but it is obviously a key technology for users in the midst of their own digital transformations and it is a necessary part of the paradigm of the hybrid cloud. Users have always had multiple data sources and have always needed to put data together in ways that it can be used by applications-these days, of course, users need something that prepares data to be used in order to promote deep learning and to facilitate applications that depend on AI and on data coming from the Internet of Things.The data integration market is said to be growing at a rate of around 14% through at least 2022. Given the size of Talend, its runway ought to be enormous. As mentioned, users do lots of different things with the technology-surprisingly, at least to me, HCM applications apparently are leading in terms of growth for data integration. One key factor is that most of the growth is anticipated to come from the cloud-basically various kinds of SaaS deployments. It is this pivot to cloud deployment that has tripped up Talend’s growth opportunity in 2019.There are a plethora of studies that look at all of the participants in the data integration market-and there are many of those. I am not going to try to suggest I have some unique perspective regarding Talend’s competitive position. I have linked above to both the Gartner survey which shows Talend as a competitor in the leader’s quadrant and to another study which looks at Talend vs. rival MuleSoft. Finally I have linked to a study looking at Talend vs. Informatica. Since readers probably do not want to take the trouble to go through all that material, I can summarize best by saying that Talend and MuleSoft are quite similar, and Talend is considered to be more flexible and far easier to implement than Informatica.From an investment perspective, the growth hiccup through which Talend is working, is not a function of its technology or of it losing pride of place to its major rivals. Talend will continue to close deals in which Informatica has been the incumbent and in which Informatica is a major competitor. It will have a much more difficult time in displacing MuleSoft-although given MuleSoft’s new orientation as part of the Salesforce stack, that is probably not all that relevant in drawing an investment conclusion.There are many other competitors. Of these, the stack vendors, i.e. Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (IBM) are going to be difficult to displace within their own stacks. But one doesn’t expect to see the stack vendors attempt to compete for data integration opportunities that are outside integrating data within their own solutions. The other competitors are of far less importance in evaluating Talend’s opportunities.As mentioned earlier in this article, Talend shares peaked in the early autumn of 2018 at a share price of around $73 and after a drastic fall in the wake of reporting its October quarter, the shares have been languishing in the low to mid $30 range. This is a function of guidance that cut growth expectations in percentage terms almost in half for calendar 2019.Rather than me trying to interpret the precise words that were used by the company management-I have simply copied the paragraph that called all of the consternation. My conclusion is that the reaction to the commentary is quite a bit overdone-and indeed has presented longer-term investors with the opportunity presented by Talend shares. The speaker here is the company CEO, Mike Tuchen.“ Yeah. So what we're seeing right now is that existing customers are actually still purchasing premise Hadoop at a pretty aggressive pace, but new customers are by and large aren't, and pretty much at all. And so, what's happening is the sort of deceleration in growth, it's actually, it's not decelerating in the sense of it's growing at a positive number year-to-date, but the deceleration is happening faster than we thought, because most new customers are now just using to solve the same problems in the cloud. “I doubt that it is a complete surprise to hear that there has been a pivot in user preferences from on-premise to the cloud. The economics for the transition have been discussed ad infinitum by many people. Cloud is cheaper. So-new projects, where there is freedom to choose, are going to the cloud, and existing projects-on prem or not are being deployed as planned.In addition to that commentary, investors were concerned that the company CEO called out an issue with the sizing of new deals. Basically, Talend had historically some new on-premise deals exceed $1 million. Those kind of deals with new users have have vanished. Cloud new deals have traditionally been smaller and they still are. The offsets are obvious. Indeed, the CFO said that the average size of cloud new deals was rising by 25% in just the last quarter. And of course, the growth of ARR from the cloud new deals will become substantial-once they reach the anniversary of the 1st year of deployment. Again, without me trying to characterize the answers more than I already have, here is what I consider to be the relevant passage from the CFO.Adam Meister""Just to put a finer point on the growth in ASP that Mike mentioned, cloud deal size is up 25% year-over-year in Q3. And just to be really clear that the profile of the customer isn't really different from the traditional on-prem big data business. But as Mike mentioned, they're starting a little bit smaller. We did win a number of cloud deals over a 100K in the quarter, and so we're seeing good steady momentum upwards.""Talend does not have the most in-depth conference calls. There were only a few Q&A’s on the call. And the CFO is newly minted, although he was the partner at GS who worked on the Talend IPO. But really, there was no discussion or exposition as to why growth rates would fall to the current consensus level other than the specifics I have highlighted above.On January 8th, Talend pre-announced certain revenue numbers as well as filing an 8k relating to the departure of the company’s head of sales. Initially shares declined further, before recovering to the current levels where they have been stuck ever since.Again, given Talend’s current valuation, much of this is of less importance. But it is worth noting that the pre-announcement called out that product revenues were in line-or perhaps a bit above expectations. The shortfall had to do with the timing of the recognition of certain professional services work. It would be typical for those revenues to be subsequently made up over the next year or so.Besides the positive attainment on subscription revenues which rose about 38% year on year last quarter, the company also reported a continued high-velocity pivot to the cloud with 25% of new ARR coming from that source, up from 14% in Q3, Conceptually, higher cloud ARR in a quarter that at least matched consensus subscription expectations, suggests that the company’s sales machine is alive and well and continuing to execute. The exact reason for the departure of the prior head of sales does not seem to be something related to current levels of sales performance.As mentioned earlier, in the past month or so, 2 analysts have raided their 2019 EPS expectations modestly for this company. That said, however, the current consensus revenue growth for this company for 2019 is just 21.5%. I am not sure if that kind of estimate, given what has been said, both on the last call, and on January 8th actually is realistic. But I have no real idea as to what guidance Talend will provide when it reports earnings after the close on Thursday. It seems a reasonable bet, I think, that its forecast will be at or higher than the consensus and that it will lay out a positive scenario for the resumption of strong revenue growth at some point in the near future.I obviously think that it is. I am, perhaps, less enamored with low valuations and transition stories than some. I have far fewer problems recommending the shares of companies with high EV/S and I do not necessarily search out companies such as this with very low EV/S ratios. But Talend as an investment, has an interesting set-up in terms of it being a leader in a high-growth space, without any obvious loss in its competitive positioning. And, for what it is worth, there is a history of consolidation in this space that may potentially encompass Talend at some point.Talend is not currently profitable and management on last quarter’s call suggested it would not be profitable in 2019. There no expense line item that is a particular outlier. GAAP gross margins were down by about 200 basis points last quarter. To an extent, the lower gross margins were a function of the very rapid increase in cloud revenues, which have a lower initial gross margin than revenues from on-premise sources.Stock based comp expense has been considerably greater this year than last, but overall, stock based comp is running at around 10% of revenues, less than might be typical for this kind of company. The company was about break-even in terms of operating cash flow; capex is quite small but nonetheless, free cash flow was negative and there is nothing to suggest that trend might change. The company urged observers not to expect that the cloud transition would lead to a higher level of deferred revenues-although I would be surprised if it did not. I expect cash flow metrics to do better than either the growth of reported earnings or the change in net losses in 2019.The company’s operating expense increase was slightly below the increase in revenues-this kept GAAP operating margin loss flat at 6%. The company did not provide any specific expense guidance for 2019. It made an acquisition called Stitch. Stitch is a simplified, frictionless solution for data integration that is useful to smaller businesses as an on-ramp for more sophisticated Talend offerings. Stitch is expected to add about 2%+ to revenues this current year and to reduce operating margins by 1%. The company was obviously bought to engender revenue synergies through new customer acquisition-but those may not be visible for another 6-12 months.Talend, both on its last conference call and in its January 8th release has focused on the cadence of its transition to the cloud from on-prem. Transitions to the cloud almost inevitably reduce revenue in initial periods and add to revenue over the life of an installation. The company has not, at this point, quantified that impact. The transition being driven by Talend is somewhat more rapid than other transitions I have followed-I think, on balance, that is a good thing. Is it going to cost the company almost half of its organic growth? If it does, is that a bad thing for shareholders?There is no one right or wrong answer to that question. At the moment, investors have answered the question with a Bronx cheer or worse ! Talend is hardly the first company to go through a transition from on-prem to cloud, although if it reaches its targets in 2019, it may be one of the quicker company’s to accomplish that undertaking.It is my expectation that at some point in 2019, Twilio’s reported revenue growth will start to reflect some congruence with what is actually happening in its business. Which quarter that might be is obviously impossible for me top foretell, short of being a fortune teller. I think the risk/rewards of owning the shares into the earnings release on Thursday are more than reasonable-even if the numbers themselves have already been released it seems possible that Talend will be in a strong position to help investors understand the transition and how it will play out through the coming year. I do not own Talend shares at this point, but I am looking for an entry point, constrained as I am with a portfolio that is currently fully invested. That said, I expect to see positive alpha from these shares over the coming year."
4228419,21815,2018-12-14T14:24:46-05:00,"The company is focusing on getting much more customers to the cloud. While that is positive, the transition itself depresses headline growth.And worse, this effect is lingering all next year with headline growth likely to be in the low 20s.Still, if you can look beyond that, their shares are much more reasonably priced now.","Shares of French big data integration company Talend (TLND) have crashed after the Q3 earnings, but closer inspection reveals that this is mostly on temporary issues as the company is going all-in on cloud migration.This is artificially depressing growth (compounded by an accountancy rule change). Unfortunately, this transition is going to last into 2019 and headline growth will decline into the 20s.Arguably, the shares were considerably overvalued before the crash, but they're reasonably priced now. Talend had a rough couple of months:Here is the last couple of years for an overview: TLND Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts You see impressive revenue growth but worsening operational performance, especially this year. Keep in mind that the non-IFRS numbers are not quite as bad.The shares crashed after the Q3 earnings, and at first site, that's a little odd as there wasn't any big miss. Both revenue and non-IFRS earnings came in a little better than expected, just the IFRS EPS that was a let-down, coming in $0.03 worse than expected at -$0.31.So it's not quite the figures themselves, what spooked investors? Two things are going on:To start with the latter (Q3CC):But this tailwind turns into a headwind next year although management didn't quantify it. The effect so far was pretty small though, and it's optical, not affecting real revenues, just the timing of the recognition.The cloud migration problem is actually clear:Combined, this is depressing revenue growth at least a bit, here is management (Q3CC):However, management doesn't expect this problem to be permanent (Q3CC):And indeed, that's already happening as the cloud ASP is up 25% from last year, and the cloud customers aren't really different from the traditional on-premise ones, they only tend to start off smaller in the cloud.The increasing emphasis on their partner ecosystem to bring in deals (see below) also has an effect here, as these customers tend to be less cloud orientated.The overall effect of the cloud push is a considerable deceleration which is what is responsible for the stock price pain. Here is CFO Adam Meister (Q3CC our emphasis):In summary:And how are they doing, here management sums it up:One should also not lose sight of the fact that this transition pain is likely to be temporary and data integration is inherently easier in the cloud (from the earnings deck):One of these latest technologies is, of course, machine learning. Customers can tap in the available resources at Amazon AWS or any of the big public cloud companies.So, in theory, at least the resulting share price crash produces an opportunity.Before investors get caught up in this cloud transformation too much, here is a reminder that their business is actually doing pretty well, with the main demand drivers:On the partner channel, the company is really focusing its professional services (which grew 36% y/y to $7.4M) on strategic consulting while using their partners (mainly systems integrators) for broader implementation services. Management explained the rationale on the Q3CC:And as a result, revenue generation through their partner ecosystem doubled from 20% a couple of years ago to 40% in Q3.But also take note of the fact that customers brought in through the partner channel don't tend to be cloud customers. So, the company is still looking for partners that can land them more (and bigger) cloud customers.Another growth driver comes from the acquisition of Stitch for $60M in cash, expected to close in Q4.Stitch is a self-service data integrator (Q3CC):Basically, Stitch helps accelerate the cloud momentum by providing a self-service solution for moving data warehouses to the cloud with a really simple solution that customers can implement in minutes and needs zero configuration. It provides Talend with an (Q3CC):Billing tends to be on a monthly basis and clients are smaller.We should also not lose sight of the fact that Talend is highly regarded as a big data integrator:Or in the words of management (Q3CC):And once landed as a customer, they do tend to buy more:And despite the cloud migration, growth in enterprise customers is still brisk:It's the guidance for next year that is going to be more important though. How much will the aggressive cloud migration slow revenue growth? TLND Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts With revenues growing at 36%, there is at least a modicum of operational leverage: TLND Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts The company is still focusing on growth, with neither margins or cash flow a main target and the company isn't far from cash flow break-even, so we're not worried about their cash flows, neither is management (Q3CC):However, with the $60M acquisition of Stitch still to be closed in Q4, their cash level, which was $89.7M at the end of Q4, will fall pretty low, so this is an item to keep in sight. TLND Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YCharts Stock-based compensation isn't excessive at 7-8% of revenues TLND EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YCharts Valuation plunged with the stock price, but the shares were pretty steeply valued not so long ago.Revenue growth is going to slow down largely as a result of an aggressive migration to the cloud. In itself, that transition is favorable but as cloud customers tend to be smaller initially and growth in on-premise declines, it slows overall revenue growth.The transition is also complicated somewhat by their increasing reliance on partners, which bring in bigger customers but less for the cloud. This is a transitional effect, but it is going to last for a while, probably all of next year with growth slowing to the low 20s.That is, it will be some time before the stock hits the dizzying heights of earlier this year but that shouldn't lead investors to pass up as the company has a lot going for it, and the cloud transition will become less important and less of a drag from 2020."

4274497,100666,2019-07-11T11:36:38-04:00,Talend was picked as a Potential Multibagger in February of this year.The stock has lagged the S&P by 30%.Is the drop justified or not?Talend is still operating as it should and the numbers mask a better story.,"On February 25 of this year, I picked Talend (TLND) as the eight stock in the portfolio of Potential Multibaggers. This French company has not performed very well versus the market, to say the least. It lags the market by 30%:Data by YChartsIn this article, I want to look at what has happened to Talend in the meantime. Is the drop legitimate or is it just a knee-jerk reaction of investors to the fact that American stocks are so in demand?(Source)Talend made its IPO on the Nasdaq on July 29, 2016, almost three years ago. This is what the stock has done since then:Data by YChartsAs you can see, the stock has risen 42.16% over those three years. It made its IPO at $18, but it popped on the first day to $25. Right now the stock price is at $36.38, a CAGR of 12.5%. While I would love that kind of return for a bluechip stock, Talend is in a hot sector of the market: big data. So, its returns are meager. The company only has a market cap of just $1B now.Just in September 2018, the stock reached a peak of nearly $70, up 180% from that $25 it traded for on the first day on the market. While a lot of Potential Multibaggers are very volatile, that doesn't mean that I like it when stocks fall, of course. A company with a market cap of just $1B, as Talend, is often a lot more volatile and as a good investor, you shouldn't be jumping in and out of stocks. But if a stock price falls so much, as a good investor, you should research and look if the fall is based on substance or if it just the inherent capriciousness of the market that reacts like a manic depressive Mr. Market, to use that image of Buffett's mentor Benjamin Graham.Before we begin, a short recap of what Talend exactly does. Essentially: big data. Talend has developed Talend Data Fabric, a software platform that integrates data and apps in real time across big data and cloud environments and traditional systems. The company also provides technical support and consulting & training. The software platform is both sold through Talend's own sales force and resellers.This graph, taken from the company's website, shows schematically what Talend does:Talend was founded in 2005 and is based in Suresnes, France, a suburb of Paris.Every growth investor and his little sister knows that big data is the place to be for a lot of tech companies. 82% of companies and non-profits have applied or want to apply big data technology to their HR. In the past, a lot of HR data were not used or only used for some boring presentation that stayed within a small circle within the company. With big data, companies can gain valuable insights from their data. There are numerous examples: predict when employees might leave, how to attract the most valuable candidates, where to find the most valuable candidates, what the perfect background is, how to keep employees happy and motivated, etc. And that is just for HR.Of course, with a huge amount of data, you need software to automatically scan the data for the most valuable trends in those data. That is where Talend can come in. The data get bigger, but the IT capabilities cannot follow:(Source: Talend website)And this is just one example of the corporate use of big data. How about the enormous amount of data of devices connected through the Internet of Things (IoT)? For now, that is still somewhat limited to some wearables and voice-assistant-powered devices, but everyone expects that trend to explode over the next few years. Or the data of customers: which customers are easier to convince to upsell? How to keep them as customers? There is an enormous amount of data that can give valuable insights if you have the right software to comb through them.(Source: Talend.com)Now, big data analysis is not the only market Talend works in, but to me it is the most exciting. This is the overview of the products of Talend, which all have to do with data and integration of data:(Source)Talend also has a community, some sort of chatroom/forum, which is very active. I think this really is an advantage. An online community makes the ties stronger and makes you belong to something, which makes the conviction higher for key decision makers and you don't leave the community that easily. Here is a snapshot of Talend's community page:While a community is often more a feature of smaller businesses, Talend is a big player in the big data sector. The company proudly presents on its website:(Source)This is quite remarkable: Talend has both the strongest strategy and the strongest current offering, according to this investigation. This looks very promising.Talend is also a 'Strong Performer' (on the edge of a leader) for strategic iPaaS and Hybrid Integration Platforms, Q1 2019(Source)This is new information, that was not known yet at the time of my previous article. IPaaS stands for Integrated Platform as a Service, a Hybrid Integration Platform (or HIP) is to let on-premise solutions integrate with cloud-based applications. Existing systems (databases, apps, warehouses...) can be integrated.So again, everything seems to be ok here.Talend already has many big clients too. Here you can see some of the more famous customers:(Source)At this moment, Talend's stock price has fallen considerably, despite the fact that it is in such a hot sector. Especially after the Q1 2019 results were made public, on May 8, the stock has slowly fallen to -25%:Data by YChartsThe results were mixed: a miss of $0.03 for non-GAAP EPS (-$0.32) and a miss of $0.13 for GAAP EPS, coming in at -$0.58 misses. The revenue came in at $57.84M, up 23.6% YoY, beating expectations by $1.25M.EPS for a growth company is not that important, while revenue is. The company's stock price rose 5% after the earnings were released, mostly because Talend was able to grow its subscriptions by 25.8%, which would even have been 31% at constant currencies. The annualized recurring revenue (ARR) that investors love so much rose even more: 28% YoY or 34% at constant currencies) to $205.1 million. Talend Cloud revenue had an impact of 36% on the new ARR. Talend Cloud more than doubled its revenue YoY for the 11th quarter in a row.Talend also reaffirmed its full-year guidance for 2019: revenue between $248M and $250M. For earnings, though, it lowered its outlook to -$1.01 to -$0.95, while it had guided for -$0.94 to -$0.88 previously.That could be seen as negative, but the reason is twofold. For earnings: Talend has increased (and plans to increase) its investments to even make a faster transition to the cloud and therefore even more ARR, so that the company can get 50% of its ARR from Talend Cloud this year already. Not a bad thing, for sure.The other reason is exactly the transformation to a subscription model. That will have an impact on Talend's short-term revenue. So, it was actually a strong performance to be able to reaffirm the guidance for revenue. We have seen in other companies, and Adobe (ADBE) comes to mind, that the transition to a subscription model can have an impact on the revenue growth over the shorter term, while the transition takes place, but has great results over the long term.A bit more on the transition to the cloud, which is inevitable and good for the long term, and a few accounting matters that impact the numbers over the next year. Investors saw an outlook of revenue growth of just 19% growth and panicked, but in the earnings deck, they should have looked at this:The FX impact can be positive or negative. For 2019, it is expected to be negative. The following years it might be positive, who knows. The slowdown because of the cloud shift has both impact on its own and on the PS (professional services), but both will go away over the years. Talend's CFO Adam Meister on the Q4 2018 earnings call said:(Source, my bold)'That number' is retention. It is very important for companies that have a subscription model. These are the retention numbers of Talend over the last years, quarter by quarter, and they are very impressive:(Source)This could mean that all customers stayed and added 20% to their products dollars or there was some churn, but existing customers even paid more than 20% extra. No matter how you look at it, this is an impressive achievement.As I have already mentioned a few times, Talend's stock price has fallen quite a bit on temporary issues while the company makes the change it has to make by putting everything on the cloud. That and an FX headwind with an impact of a few percentages makes the growth rate of Talend optically lower. This will have an impact for 2019 and probably even for a few years. That is an opportunity, in my opinion, for the smart investor to accumulate Talend's shares over the course of the next few months. Hedge funds are certainly paying attention and there are more of them than ever that have taken a position in Talend:(Source)Talend has a P/S ratio of just 6 and if the revenue target of $250M is met for FY 2019, even 4. So, Talend is certainly not expensive for a growth stock. Just to compare: Okta (OKTA) stands at 35, Zscaler (ZS) at 39, Alteryx (AYX) at 25, etc. That doesn't mean I don't like these stocks (I really do!), but Talend has also the potential for scaling and high-profit margins over the long term, so its P/S ratio of 4 seems to derisk the stock a bit.Another important element is that because of its leadership in an interesting market, Talend could be a takeover target for big companies such as Oracle (ORCL) or IBM (IBM).My initial cost base in Talend is $37.75. My position is still relatively small and I want to build it out over the next years, patiently and critically. I might buy more shares in the next few days. Because the big drop doesn't seem to have enough substance to be justifiable. More hedge funds than ever have a position and the transition to the cloud is a necessity. With a P/S of just 4, Talend seems to have a reasonable valuation and it could even be an acquisition target for IBM or Oracle.The stock is allowed to stay as a Potential Multibagger, since the drop is more because of market sentiment and short-term thinking than because of a fundamental change in the business itself.If you have enjoyed this article and you don't want to miss other articles about growth stocks written with the long term in mind, feel free to hit the follow button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"

We're not so sure after the latest (Q4 2017) quarter, as we will explain below in greater detail.But what sums up that position is the following graph:TLND Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThat is, there is solid revenue growth, but EBITDA and net income are actually moving in the wrong direction, and what's more, there isn't any immediate prospect of improvement either.There is no doubt the company has a lot going for it though. It's the recognized leader in the field not only in surveys like those of Gartner but more importantly, this is demonstrated by its commercial success (from Talend Q4 investor deck):There are parts of the company that are really growing much faster, like Asian sales, enterprise clients, and a move to the cloud, according to the Q4CC:The company is able to rake in an increasing amount of big, well known corporate customers, quite a number of these were mentioned on the Q4CC.As we argued in our previous article, a platform offers so many opportunities for growth:How are they doing? Here is how the company itself depicts their strategy (from Talend Q4 investor deck):Corresponding to the points above:Data Fabric:And its ecosystem:It is interesting to see how the company itself sees the market, here from an earlier Talend blog post:So, there is competition, no doubt, but management isn't all that worried, from the Q4CC:But management argues they can still easily demonstrate the superiority of their own offerings versus Informatica, and some smaller competitors have reached out and could very well be bought.Another potential threat is the big cloud hosting companies themselves moving in the space, the likes of Amazon with AWS and Microsoft with Azure.There is some mentioning of AWS moving more into data integration. For instance, there is Amazon Glue, but this doesn't (yet?) offer a serious competitive threat, according to management (Q4CC):With respect to the acquisition of MuleSoft (NYSE:MULE) by Salesforce (CRM), here is the Talend blog post again:We're not entirely convinced by this positive spin. For instance, Talend itself has moved into API management with the acquisition of Restlet. One can see that in two ways though.First, the Restlet acquisition brings them into more direct competitive contact with MuleSoft, but on the other hand, it could allow the company also to improve its competitive stance as its platform offers both data integration and API management.It depends on how Restlet stacks up against Mulesoft, and given the vastly different acquisition prices ($130M for Restlet while Salesforce paid $6.5B for Mulesoft), this isn't entirely reassuring.Talend offers an open-source freemium model in which potential customers can try simple versions with limited capabilities:Earlier in the year, the company experienced problems with attrition in its sales force, but these seem to have been resolved and its sales force produced record productivity per head in Q4.TLND Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe above figures are GAAP figures, but the operating margin, even a GAAP one of -25% isn't terribly appealing. Management argues that the company has ""significantly improved operating leverage.""While gross margins increased 100 basis points to 77% in 2017, operating expenses increased by $31.9M, which is a 23.5% increase, so this is growing considerably slower than revenue, which grew 40% in the year.However, in what is normally their seasonally strongest quarter, there was some kind of acceleration in operating cost. R&D expenses grew 52% in Q4, G&A expenses increased 43% and S&M expenses increased by 36% (all y/y).TLND Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsCash flows are still not positive for a 12-month period, although we're not far off:And share-based compensation is $6.28M for the year, which is boosting cash flows of course:TLND Total Long-Term Debt (Annual) data by YCharts The Balance sheet is pretty healthy, and there isn't any alarming rate of increasing share count.TLND EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsAn EV/S of nine times isn't cheap. This year analysts expect a (non-GAAP) loss of 48 cents per share, improving to a loss of 17 cents a share in 2019.There are two contradictory forces working on this stock. There is the competitive aspect, which shows a lot of strength which isn't likely to change materially in the near future.On the other hand, there is the financial performance, which still shows significant losses which aren't going away in the near future either, despite some operational leverage.We tend to weigh the first as much more significant, but everything has a price, and we think that at 9 times sales, the price you have to pay for the shares on the market really is fair value at the moment."
4173510,103480,2018-05-13T14:56:28-04:00,"Talend reported mixed Q1 earnings, with a modest beat to the top line and in line earnings per share.Revenue growth accelerated to 42% y/y, up from the company's Q4 exiting run rate of 36% y/y growth.Even after the stock's ~4% correction post-earnings, Talend's valuation has raced far ahead of its fundamentals this year.Trading at nearly 8x forward revenues, Talend is priced for perfection and doesn't leave much room for upside.","Talend (TLND), the French software company known for its Data Integration Fabric product, is a perfect example of how a lesser-known cloud company can generate outsized returns for investors. Being both domiciled overseas and concentrated in a very esoteric area of infrastructure software, Talend generated barely any buzz when it went public in the summer of 2016 at $18 per share. It popped 50% on its first day of trading, but traded sideways for quite some time, before catching its big break this year. Shares of Talend have rallied an astonishing 50% this year, taking the stock to more than 3x its original IPO price:TLND data by YChartsAfter releasing the results of its first quarter, however, Talend shares have pulled back - and in my opinion, this is the first leg of a much-needed pullback in the stock. I first recommended Talend late last year when the stock was trading in the mid-$30s, believing the company to be worth $50 per share - at the time representing a 7.5x forward revenue multiple. Talend has since raced past this price target, and shares are looking richly valued.Even after Talend's post-Q1 pullback at $57, shares still carry a market cap of $1.67 billion. After taking out the company's balance sheet cash of $95 million and $1 million of debt, it has an enterprise value of $1.58 billion.The company has also just updated its FY18 guidance range, boosting the forecast by about $2 million to $202.6-204.6 million, representing a 37% y/y growth rate at the midpoint. This puts Talend's current valuation at 7.74x EV/FY18 revenues, a steep multiple to pay for a small-cap company with a limited operating history and wide loss margins. A growth rate in the high 30s is no longer a distinguishing factor, either - since Talend's IPO in 2016, dozens of other SaaS companies have debuted on the public stage with similar or higher growth rates.Though Talend remains a solid company fundamentally - infrastructure software is a great space to be in, especially this year as Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) huge $6.5 billion acquisition of MuleSoft at a 14x revenue multiple brought plenty of attention to the industry - the stock is currently at best a hold. A company tracking this closely to 8x forward revenues has very little room for upside, especially in a volatile market. Shares of Talend are priced for perfection, and as seen in this quarter's results which tracked so closely to Wall Street estimates, perfection is not guaranteed.Let's take a look at Talend's Q1 results:Figure 1. Talend first quarter earningsSource: Talend investor relationsIn my opinion, this was a mixed quarter with both positive and negative results to highlight. The strongest results were in the top-line figures - Talend achieved aggressive revenue growth to $46.8 million, representing a 42% y/y growth rate. Analysts in the quarter had only expected $45.6 million, or +39% y/y.What's especially impressive is the fact that this quarter's growth rate represented a massive acceleration. In fact, this quarter saw the best growth rate for the company since Q1 of last year. Talend's growth rate in each of the past four quarters had been:The fact that Talend has been able to maintain >40% growth even as it stretches toward a ~$200 million run rate is truly impressive. Subscription revenues, the much more important revenue stream due to its near-pure profit margins, saw even stronger growth in the quarter, growing 44% y/y to $39.8 million.However, that's where the good news halts. Talend was able to hold its overall 76% gross margin in the quarter due to a higher mix of subscription revenues (its professional services revenue stream, which is essentially performed at cost, represented a lower total of the revenue base). However, its subscription gross margins ticked down to just 86.5%, down 230bps from 88.8% in 1Q17.Of course, Talend already has a best-in-class subscription gross margin in the high 80s, which makes it an envy of the software industry. But if the declining margin is going to be the start of a trend, that's a potential red flag for a company that has yet to hit profitability.The good news is that Talend made up for the gross margin drop in operating expenses, at least somewhat. Sales and marketing expenses of $26.1 million in the quarter (Talend's largest expense category, similar to other SaaS companies) represented 56% of revenues, down from 60% in 1Q17. As the company continues to scale, it will hopefully continue to capture additional sales efficiency. Total operating margin on an IFRS basis, however, stayed roughly flat at -22% as compared to -21% in 1Q17. The company still has a long way to go in achieving profitability, and Talend has shown that its strong growth is expensive to buy. Pro forma EPS in the quarter of -$0.18 was in line with analysts' expectations.On the bright side, a large portion of expenses is due to stock-comp, a non-cash charge. Talend managed to grow quarterly free cash flows by more than double in the quarter to $5.1 million, distinguishing it among SaaS peers. Very few companies of its scale (less than $50 million in quarterly revenues) have managed to attain breakeven free cash flows, let alone the 11% FCF margins that Talend achieved this quarter:Figure 2. Talend FCFSource: Talend investor relationsTalend's Q1 results, despite being a modest beat-and-raise quarter, contained risks along with the positive highlights. The accelerating growth from Q4 to Q1 was especially encouraging to see, but the deterioration in subscription gross margins and the fact that the bottom line was only in line with Wall Street expectations with no improvements to operating margin were less exciting.At any rate, Talend's sky-high valuation would have us expecting more from the company. Talend investors who have enjoyed the massive year-to-date rise would be wise to lock in gains now. Given how quickly the stock has appreciated this year in the face of mixed results, shares have limited upside from here."
4187332,104556,2018-07-15T13:28:18-04:00,Talend is a software company in the data integration space that has been disrupting legacy providers.Innovations in big data and the cloud have led to the company's recent success.The company also boasts a differentiated business model that has resonated with enterprise customers.,"Big data is all the rage. In fact, 82% of organizations have adopted or are planning to adopt big data technologies. However, dealing with billions of data points, especially when different formats are involved, becomes a huge headache. To alleviate this problem, companies can use Talend (NASDAQ:TLND) and go “from zero to big data without coding in under 10 minutes.”Talend is a disruptor in the ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) space resulting from innovations in the fastest growing portion of the market and a differentiated business model.In today’s day and age, data primarily comes from three locations: on-site databases, the cloud and machine data like cars or internet connected devices. With data pouring from all these places, it becomes difficult to aggregate for analysis.This is where Talend comes into play. The company is an open-source software platform that allows businesses to move data so they can make the best decisions possible. Customers using the company’s Data Fabric can pull in data from anywhere so they can analyze it and uncover business insights to gain a competitive advantage.Source: Talend Investor DeckTalend is not just another data integrator though; it is on the cutting edge of the big data and cloud movements. These portions of Talend’s business have increased more than 100% YoY in each of the past 14 quarters. And this is why Talend’s revenue has been accelerating. In 2015, revenue grew 21% to $76 million, in 2016, revenue soared 39% to $106 million, and in 2017, sales jumped 40% to $149 million.Talend is disrupting the current heavyweights, Informatica (private) and IBM(NYSE:IBM) because of a couple differentiators. To be clear, Talend is not a top dog, as evidenced by the graph below, in the traditional data integration space. However, it is quickly stealing market share in the big data and cloud portions of the overall market. The company, apparently, has very little competition as an ETL pure play in these two specific markets. Source: GartnerAs stated, these two segments for Talend have been growing over 100% versus the industry’s 22% growth for big data and cloud integration. Ultimately, three reasons reveal why Talend is doing so well in this space.First, Talend is made to run on Hadoop (just think of Hadoop as a way to store and analyze an insane amount of data). Talend ran a study and boasts it can run at least 5x faster than competitors. This makes a huge difference when petabytes (1,000 terabytes) of data are analyzed.Second, Talend is open source so thousands of developers have enhanced the platform over time. This lowers sales and marketing costs in the future because developers find the products, try them out, then upgrade to paid versions. As evidence, Talend’s dollar based expansion rate, the proxy for upsells, has stayed above 120% for the last 16 quarters, hitting 121% in the latest.Source: Talend Investor DeckPlus, Talend is compatible with over 1,000 different data sources (i.e. applications like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) or different databases)). Since it is open source, there is a real network effect that strengthens the ecosystem and integration capabilities.Third, Talend’s business model is very different from typical providers. Talend charges based on number of developers (per seat) using the software rather than the amount of data running through the system. This is not a trivial distinction. The company even claims that it can undercut competitors on pricing by a factor of five. Companies have complained that they should not be charged excessively as more data naturally flows through the same integration job. Talend agrees and this has resulted in a 46% year-over-year increase in the number of customers spending over $100,000. Now Talend boasts 380 of these clients out of a total of over 1,600 customers. For a subscription company this is a rather small number of total customers, versus other software providers like HubSpot’s 45,000 clients. This shows that Talend is dealing with some big-time enterprise. And if you read through the conference calls you get the same idea because the CEO spouts off tons of enterprise wins.Source: Talend Investor DeckIn the latest quarter, Talend grew total sales 42% while slimming its non-IFRS net loss (like GAAP, but for international companies since Talend was founded in France) from -17% a year ago to -11%. Additionally, 77% gross margins and 11% free cash flow margins show that the company has great potential for profitability. This is because 85% of the company’s sales are from recurring subscriptions rather than maintenance contracts.Source: Talend Investor DeckFor full-year guidance, the company expects around $205 million at the high end. Considering the company’s market cap is $1.8 billion and enterprise value a tick below at $1.7 billion after backing out cash, the company trades at a forward EV/sales ratio of 8.5x. While certainly not cheap, Talend is gunning for operating margins in the 20%’s. Given the solid operating leverage we have seen thus far, I don’t think margins like that are out of the picture. As a sort of thought experiment, if Talend had 20% operating margins today, the company would be trading at less than 40x EBIT. While also not cheap, this gives a little more context to the valuation.Source: Talend Investor DeckAs stated, Talend boasts a relatively small number of customers for a subscription software company. This means that it is working with big enterprises rather than small-to-medium sized businesses. Intuitively, this makes sense because smaller companies likely won’t be working with the same amount of data as a multi-national. However, with the proliferation of data, I’m confident Talend will start to see traction down-market. With that said, in Talend’s current position, enterprise sales mean longer sales cycles. This usually results in a higher cost to do business, leading to higher sales and marketing costs. While this could delay the path to profitability, Talend seems to be doing a fine job at balancing the trade-offs.The other risk is more existential. The concept of edge computing is such that machine data will eventually be processed at “the edge” or within the device itself once processing speeds are powerful enough. Rather than aggregating data in one spot, called a data lake, machine data can be processed more efficiently. Picture an individual Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) car analyzing its own data rather than sending it to Tesla data scientists to then aggregate it and make sense of it. Modern-day no-SQL databases like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) are also innovating in this space with aggregation frameworks. But at the end of the day, I think there will still be a spot for Talend’s ETL technology in all of this as these innovations are likely many years away.The data integration space is always changing and innovation is rampant. Talend is not a shoe-in for grabbing more market share since it still needs to stay cutting edge. However, the company has proven to be a formidable foe to legacy data integrators. Talend looks, specifically, to be a disruptor in the big data and cloud segments of this industry. As revenue accelerates, you might want to hop on this data train as it is just picking up speed.Author’s Note: Hey you! Yes, you.

4146908,103480,2018-02-14T23:15:03-05:00,"Talend, the French big data company, posted strong Q4 earnings that sent shares up a massive 17% in after-hours trading.Revenue results were only in line with analyst consensus.Big earnings pops in high-growth software tend to cool down, especially if there are no near-term positive catalysts.Locking in gains on Talend, especially when shares are trading above 6x forward revenues (in line with peers), would be a smart move.","Talend (NASDAQ: TLND), the often-ignored French software company that focuses on big data integration via its flagship product Talend Data Fabric, seems to have finally hit its big moment. Up to this point, Talend has been playing the role of an understudy in a Broadway play - showing good performances relative to its peers, but a company whose name has been widely unknown to a general audience.On the heels of its Q4 earnings release, however, Talend has stepped boldly into the spotlight, with shares shooting up to $45, up nearly 20% in after-hours trading in what seems to be a wildly positive (and mildly absurd) reaction to a good quarter, but one without any landmark surprises to merit such a big jump. And note also that Talend was already up a strong 3% during the regular trading day prior to posting earnings, on a day that many other smaller-cap tech names saw a bit of red. Without factoring in the earnings rally, Talend at $38 was already up 2% YTD (largely ignoring the bloodshed in the rest of the market, especially tech stocks) and 45% over the past twelve months; the additional 17% gift from earnings extends its rally much further.TLND data by YChartsAt this juncture, investors have to ask themselves: is there any further benefit to holding onto Talend shares? Does the stock really have meaningful fuel left for a sustained rally? Many tech stocks that have seen this type of a double-digit earnings reaction on a good, but not spectacular quarter, have largely been unable to continue a rally. Such names include fan favorites like Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM) and Alteryx (NASDAQ: AYX) - without a distinct positive catalyst in the near term, the earnings pop is essentially as good as it gets.Now trading at 6.2x its forward revenue forecast for FY18, Talend is no longer cheap, either. Last Fall I had picked out Talend as a good stock for international diversification (as the company's revenue is concentrated in Europe) and, at the time trading in the neighborhood of the low 5s multiple, was cheap enough to bet on. At $45, Talend looks fully valued.Earnings for Q4 were, as previously stated, decent but not brilliant. Here's a look at Talend's earnings summary for the quarter:Figure 1. Talend Q4 results Source: Talend investor relationsThe top line was - well, it wasn't really all that inspiring. Talend grew 36% y/y to $41.5 million, decelerating from 40% growth in Q3. Results were also just in line with consensus expectations.For a software company - especially for a recent IPO like Talend and in the high-growth SaaS category - an in-line quarter is basically a miss; and it's sort of like getting a B in a class where the grading curve is predispositioned toward As. Virtually every software company that has reported this quarter has beat expectations - and even some of those companies flopped in investors' earnings reactions. The enthusiastic response for Talend's quarter is a bit of a question mark.Talend, in Q3, had guided to Q4 revenues of $41-42 million. It delivered just the midpoint of that range. Also, note that the weakness of the U.S. dollar helped the company's non-FX adjusted growth rates a lot, as the company's revenues are primarily non-USD.It's good that the bulk of Talend's revenues are recurring subscriptions (85% in FY18), but the growth rate is slowing down. Take a look at Talend's quarterly subscription growth rates over the past several quarters:Source: Talend investor relationsTalend's subscription growth rate of 40% y/y (on an FX-adjusted basis, it's actually 34% y/y) is the lowest it's been in the past six quarters, which have all shown growth in the low 40s. Of course, deceleration is expected in software companies as they reach a larger scale - but that's just the point about the surprise earnings reaction. Investors reward accelerating growth with double-digit gains, not the normal deceleration we see everywhere.Worse yet, Talend's operating margins actually worsened in the quarter. Software companies should be tackling growth as well as gaining operating leverage with each quarter, not ballooning into higher loss margins. On an IFRS basis, Talend's operating margin widened to -26%, down from -21% in the prior year; on a pro forma basis (which primarily adds back stock comp), operating margins still worsened to -20% from -18% in 4Q16. This was due to acceleration of costs across all components of Talend's operating expenditures - sales and marketing, R&D, and general overhead all grew faster than revenues did.Talend still beat analysts' pro forma expectations of -$0.29 by a penny, posting PF EPS of -$0.28 - but again, this isn't the caliber of results that demands a buying spree.In terms of Talend's outlook, it's mostly a yawn. The company is forecasting FY18 revenues of $200-202 million (we note that Mimecast is giving an extremely lasered-in range here: a $2 million spread on the initial guidance for a full 12-month period is extremely thin), implying 35% growth from FY17's total revenues of $148.6 million. Talend seems to be following a rather normal growth glide path that most software companies experience, with growth tapering off 4-5 points every year after sinking below 40%.From a raw numbers perspective, there's nothing truly inspiring about Talend's Q4 results. Maybe investors are buying more and more into the story as big data becomes top-of-mind for enterprises across all industries, especially in Europe where companies' install rate of the latest software is still less penetrated than in the U.S., Talend is bound to capture a lot of the growth in spending. Gartner, the leading industry analyst, has also forecast that IT spending on software will accelerate to 9.5% growth this year, up about half a percent from growth in 2017.But this isn't new news - this has been part of the Talend bull case for awhile, and there's no reason that Talend's okay quarter should have brought out the bulls all in one go. Like Atlassian after its huge rise post-earnings, Talend will probably trade sideways from here as the stock scrambles for support for its rally.If you're insistent on investing in a European tech stock, Mimecast (NASDAQ: MIME) - a London-based cybersecurity company that focuses on securing email communications - is a superior pick at this juncture, with the company reporting a much larger beat margin versus analyst expectations, and with a much more favorable profitability picture.This is not to say that Talend is a poor company - in fact, it's a fantastic company, with a high degree of product differentiation and few competitors in a key space of enterprise software. The only problem is that at this juncture, Talend's stock looks fully valued and will struggle for direction as investors try to justify the ~20% rally."
4223725,103480,2018-11-20T19:08:35-05:00,"Shares of Talend have lost more than 50% from peak values reached in September.The company posted an in-line quarter in Q3, the second disappointing earnings release in a row.Despite perceived weakness, Talend's 36% y/y growth rate in the quarter is still impressive and represents barely any deceleration.The company is also one of few high-growth SaaS companies that generates roughly breakeven free cash flows.Talend now trades at a bargain-basement valuation multiple of 3.6x FY19 revenues, its cheapest valuation since going public.","It's no small secret that software stocks have taken a lashing over the past few weeks. After rising precipitously in the first half of 2018, investors have rotated to value and dumped shares of high-growth stocks. Some companies have been hurt more than others, and few more so than Talend (TLND), the French big data company that is known for its Talend Data Fabric platform that specializes in data blending and integration.Expectations for Talend have run high this year, and over the past two quarters, Talend has delivered just in-line results. In an earnings season where investors have been particularly sensitive to thin revenue beats, Talend's perceived top-line weakness has caused it to lose about 45% since reporting earnings. Year to date, Talend has retraced all of its gains (at one point, it was up more than 2x from the start of the year) and is down 11% YTD and down 54% from all-time highs above $73:TLND data by YChartsIn my view, it's a good time to start treating Talend like a value stock. Talend's value proposition and its blue-chip customer base aren't going away. Recall that Talend's software allows IT workers to transform tedious data-prep tasks into automated processes, saving hours and weeks of work. Even if the global economy begins to decelerate, this is the kind of software that businesses won't scrimp on.Talend's installed base should also give investors a large degree of comfort. Despite the fact that its market cap is cratering to small-cap status below $1 billion, Talend is supported by Fortune 500 companies in its billings roster. This quarter, Talend exceeded the 2,000+ customer milestone, with anchor clients including Citigroup (C), HP Inc. (HPQ), and Toyota (TM) in its roster.Figure 1. Talend customer baseSource: Talend investor relationsIn short - even though the stock has wiped out half of its value, Talend's business hasn't remotely weakened. In my view, this creates a tactical buying opportunity.Let's run a quick sense check on where Talend is trading. At today's share price of ~$34, Talend has a market cap of $1.01 billion. If we net out the $89.7 of cash and $0.9 million of debt on its balance sheet, we are left with an enterprise value of $921 million.For the current year, Talend has updated its guidance range to $205.2-206 million in revenues (its prior guidance range was a wider spread around the same midpoint, at $204.6-206.6 million):Figure 2. Talend FY18 guidanceSource: Talend investor relationsLet's conservatively assume that Talend's growth decelerates to 25% y/y in FY19 (year to date, Talend's revenues have risen 39%). This gives us an estimate of $257 million for next year's revenues and implies that Talend is currently trading at a valuation of 3.6x EV/FY19 revenues.No SaaS stock that's still growing in the mid-30s while producing breakeven cash flows comes close to trading at this low of a valuation, even with the recent October fallout. Here's a comparison against where other ~30% growers are currently trading:ZEN EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsHere's a look at Talend's latest quarterly results:Figure 3. Talend 3Q18 resultsSource: Talend investor relationsRevenues grew 36% y/y to $52.1 million, roughly in line with Wall Street's estimates of $51.9 million. Growth was evenly spread between both subscription and professional services revenue streams, each of which grew 36% y/y.Talend has continued to focus on pushing its customers to the cloud. CEO Mike Tuchen noted that this quarter is the ninth in a row that cloud subscriptions have exceeded a 2x growth rate. Here's some additional qualitative commentary from Tucson on the Q3 earnings call:Talend also noted that it saw strong growth in Asia Pacific, where revenues more than doubled. Talend's relatively low penetration in the so-called ""tiger economies"" creates a strong growth trajectory in the near term.One point of weakness in the quarter, however, was on gross margins. GAAP gross margins fell to 75.0% in the quarter, down 340bps from 78.4% in the year-ago quarter. We note that professional services margin continued to dwindle, down to just 3% (essentially performed at cost) this quarter. However, Talend's 75% gross margin still puts it in a position of strength relative to the average SaaS company, and its ~15% year-to-date mix of professional services revenues is still reasonable - unlike fellow SaaS company Appian (APPN), which relies on low-margin services for nearly half of its overall revenues.Adam Meister, Talend's new CFO, noted that the company is working on strengthening its partnerships with third-party software implementation firms in order to outsource as much of the services work as possible. Over time, this should reverse some of the gross margin headwinds that Talend is seeing.Unfortunately, Talend also made investments in headcount that expanded operating expenses: sales and marketing costs grew 37% y/y to $28.4 million, R&D costs grew 52% y/y to $9.9 million, and general and administrative costs expanded 40% y/y to $10.2 million. As a result, GAAP operating losses doubled to -$9.4 million.Still, Talend's pro forma EPS of -$0.09 was able to edge past Wall Street consensus of -$0.10. In addition, in the year to date, Talend was still able to maintain a roughly breakeven free cash flow profile, with FCF margins of just -2%:Figure 4. Talend FCFSource: Talend investor relationsInvestors should continue to focus on Talend's growth opportunities. Its ~120% net retention rate indicates a strong track record for upselling within its blue-chip customer base, while strong new customer growth in international markets has helped Talend to expand beyond 2,000 customers. Use cases for Talend software are only growing as the C-suite's appetite for big data solutions expands.Despite slight profit headwinds this quarter, Talend is still managing minimal cash burn and may hit full free cash flow profitability by FY19. For a stock of this caliber, at mid-30s growth and a roughly breakeven FCF profile, Talend's current <4x forward revenue multiple is drastically low. A risk-off attitude and indiscriminate selling in SaaS stocks have jolted Talend into its newfound status as a value stock, and investors should pay attention if shares keep falling. My price target on the stock is $55, representing 6x EV/FY19 revenues (still below most SaaS peers in the ~30% growth category) and 62% upside from current levels."

Post IPO, the company has constantly been trading above its list price, and has attained a Billion-Dollar Unicorn status in the public market.Talend was founded in 2006 by Bertrand Diard and Fabrice Bonan who wanted to build a system integration solution that could be simple and flexible to deploy. They wanted to build an open source solution for proprietary ETL/data integration tools of the time. Talend initially expanded into close areas to provide a complete data management platform, and then into the application integration space. Within a few years, Talend began to work in the big data space. It now supports traditional data use cases and provides advanced integration platform for big data.Talend recently reported its third quarter results. Revenues grew 40% over the year to $38.9 million, vs. analyst estimates of $38.4 million. Net losses for the quarter narrowed down to $5.3 million during the quarter, from $6.4 million a year ago.By segment, subscription revenues grew 41% to $33 million. Professional services brought in the remaining $5.9 million in revenues for the quarter.For the current quarter, Talend forecast revenues of $41-$42 million with non-IFRS loss from operations of $(9.2)-$(8.2) million. The market was looking for revenues of $41.6 million. The company expects to end the year with revenues of $148.1-$149.1 million and non-IFRS loss from operations of $(21.1)-$(20.1) million.Talend has been focusing on its product and market expansion activities. Recently, it announced the launch of a new European Data Center that will cater to its expansion in the European market. It also introduced a new Data Governance and Compliance solution to help its customers address the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation.Talend also launched a new solution called Talend Metadata Manager to bring transparency and accessibility to data lakes and other Big Data projects by providing an end-to-end view of enterprise information. It will help collect information from databases, modern self-service analytical tools like Tableau, big data and cloud platforms like Cloudera and Microsoft Azure, and any other data pipelines managed by the Talend Data Fabric integration platform.Earlier last month, Talend also announced the acquisition of Cloud-Based API Design and Testing solutions provider Restlet. Reslet is a cloud-based API design and testing platform that uses the cloud to provide API design, documentation, testing, and hosting capabilities to developers. Talend plans to leverage Restlet's technology to making it easier for customers to take an API-first design approach to monetizing and securely sharing information in real-time with clients and business partners.The market is pleased with Talend's performance. Its stock is currently trading at $40.37 with a market cap of $1.2 billion. The stock has climbed steadily from $18 that it had listed at, back in the summer of 2016 at a valuation of $537 million. Earlier last month, the stock had reached a 52-week high of $46.32. Prior to listing, Talend had raised $101.58 million from investors including Balderton Capital, Bpifrance, Chausson Finance, Galileo Partners, Idinvest Partners, Iris Capital, Silver Lake Partners, Silver Lake Sumeru, and Sumeru Equity Partners at an undislosed valuation."
4130294,21815,2017-12-07T04:22:16-05:00,"Talend is still a fairly small company faced with a big market opportunity in data integration.Revenue growth is still fast and operational leverage has already set in, even if the company is not yet profitable and isn't likely to be anytime soon.At least the company doesn't bleed cash and has no debt.Valuation isn't cheap, but given the opportunity and the recent sell-off, we think a reasonable entry point is emerging.","Talend (TLND) management during the Q3CC. They sure don't lack confidence. Let's find out whether they have a point.Talend is a French big data company that isn't very well known, but if you are looking for an excellent introduction, look no further than SA contributor Gary Alexander's excellent article.Revenue growth has been excellent, running at 40% a year:But as the graph shows, EBITDA and earnings are still solidly negative, even if these are GAAP values.The growth strategy for these SaaS business service companies like Talend isn't a secret, it's following a similar playbook of other companies with the same model, like Ellie Mae (ELLI), Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), ServiceNow (NOW) Tableau (DATA), Workiva (WK) and the like:The core, and fundamental part is of course the company's Data Fabric, which produces the core business proposition for customers. The Data Fabric is the company's platform that allows its clients to collect and draw all kinds of data from all kinds of sources and integrate the data from wherever they are located (different clouds, on premise, etc.). The operation is a simple drag-and-drop interface that simplifies the integration process.And the company is doing this well enough in order to be recognized by the likes of Gartner as a leader in the sector, although it's hardly alone:We're showing you that here because we could talk at length about the product's features and the stuff they're adding but in isolation, that wouldn't make much sense because you have to compare it with the competition, and have a fair amount of background in this stuff to be able to make any kind of qualified judgement.We don't feel qualified enough to do all that, but others like Gartner have done that for us, albeit the result isn't very compelling in the sense that it clearly distinguishes the competition. This is what management itself argues is their competitive strength:We're not entirely convinced here. The company's core competence is data integration, and data has a habit of being located in different sites and produced by different applications.So almost by definition the company has to have one comprehensive platform, run natively on big data and in the cloud and be adaptable and extensible. We are inclined to say that this comes with the territory, but perhaps it's more adaptable and extensible than the competition.Having a user-based subscription pricing model also doesn't seem to be a unique differentiator to us, many SaaS business application providers use such a model.But yet another way to look at it is the simple fact that they are raking in new customers, for instance big ones (enterprise):This is perhaps the most telling, an increasing number (+59%, y/y) of very large ('enterprise') companies is paying top dollar for the company's services, the growth of which management expects to either stay stable or accelerate. So it will continue to move up, according to management.With a $17B addressable market, the market itself is still fairly underdeveloped so they have plenty of runway ahead of them (for instance, in Asia Pacific, they had the second quarter of triple-digit growth). As are the up-sell opportunities:We'll provide the small print from the investor deck slide:The company also made its first acquisition in order to improve the functionality of its platform. The company that was acquired is the French company Restlet, which provides solutions for cloud-based API design and testing. They didn't have any revenue yet.Management argues that this will speed up Talend's cloud offering by allowing easier data sharing using API. Here is management explaining why Restlet is different from competing approaches (like MuleSoft (NYSE:MULE)), from the Q3CC:They also expect revenues to ramp from this in 2019.The company is also working on the third step of our brief strategy introduction for business SaaS providers set out above. They started a developers community in the quarter, to (from Q3CC):So they have a broad-based community already.The company also has service revenue ($5.5M in the quarter or just over 14% of revenues). Service revenue generally grows much slower and commands much lower margins, but it still adds to the bottom line. Still, growth here was a very respectable 23% y/y in the quarter.The GAAP operating margins are steadily moving upwards, displaying considerable operational leverage.Sales and marketing is by far the biggest part of operating expenses, but these grew at only 20% in the quarter (versus Q3 last year), while revenues grow at double that rate.And indeed, their non-GAAP operating margin improved from -19% a year ago to -6% in the quarter. They have their own figures, which are non-GAAP (or non-IFRS, as it happens):There is a 6 percentage point difference between the IFRS and non-IFRS operating margin (-12% versus -6%) caused by stuff like stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles.While operating margin increased nicely y/y, management also issued some kind of warning not to extrapolate this linearly (from Q3CC):The higher attrition was due to marketing leadership changes and the company is now addressing that problem by increased hiring, so margin improvement might be stalled for a little while. Management during the Q3CC:And here is their long-term operating model:As you can see, the company has a long way to go with S&M and G&A, so they're not anywhere close to their targeted operating margin of 20%-22% yet, but at least these are decreasing as a percentage of revenue so leverage is kicking in.Free cash flow was minus $3.4M in Q3 compared to +$1.3M in the third quarter in the prior year. It is the goal of management to be roughly cash flow break-even annually.The company has $94.6M in cash and cash equivalents on the books and no debt. The company did sell 2.75M of new ADSs last month.It's not a terrible rise in the share count (and the November increase isn't reflected yet) but for investors this still provides negative leverage.The company provided the following outlook (from the earnings PR):Valuation has been trending up on a sales multiple, although with the rotation out of tech last year this is correcting a bit.And let's compare this with some of the other SaaS business providers mentioned above:This is only very indicative as some of these companies (like Workday and especially ServiceNow) also have debt on their books and others (like ELLI) are already profitable and some are growing slower or have higher or lower margins.Analysts expect an EPS loss of $0.80 this year, falling to a loss of $0.50 the next.Eight times sales is fairly steep, but the company is still growing very fast and it is creating operational leverage and not bleeding much cash.It is likely that the company will continue to grow fast in the foreseeable future, even if the law of large numbers will slow that growth down at some stage.But that same law will produce additional operational leverage, and hopefully produce increasing free cash flow with which to neutralize the negative leverage from a rising share count at least in part.Given the high multiples, the market loves these kind of companies and we tend to agree in this case. The market for data integration seems to have plenty of runway left and Talend looks well positioned to take a considerable bite out of this.Adding functionality, up-selling and operational leverage should provide additional boosters. One might wait a little to see how the present rotation out of tech plays out, but we feel this is becoming a decent buy opportunity."
4124156,103480,2017-11-13T06:09:37-05:00,"Talend, a French big data software company with ADRs listed in the U.S., is a prime choice for diversifying into international growth tech stocks.The company reported a fantastic Q3, with revenues growing 40% (no deceleration at all from FY16). Talend is also breakeven on free cash flow.Approximately half of its revenues is derived from EMEA (unlike most U.S.-based tech stocks), and is growing rapidly in APAC, where it has nearly zero penetration.The need for big data-related software can only grow as enterprises continue to treat their data stores as a valuable asset.","It's been more than a year since Talend (NASDAQ: TLND), the big data integration software platform headquartered in France (with a secondary California headquarters), went public at $18 per share. For virtually the entirety of its life as a public company, Talend has been one of the least-known tech stocks trading on the NASDAQ due to its international location and rather obscure business description. Nevertheless, it has been a top performer on lower trading volumes, up nearly 2.5x since going public and is up 97% year to date.TLND data by YChartsDespite a strong run year-to-date, and after posting solid Q3 earnings and seeing a muted stock price reaction, Talend's shares sit at approximately 6.4x EV/FTM revenues - a fairly underwhelming multiple for a 40% grower with a breakeven cash flow profile. While shares aren't materially undervalued, there's opportunity to squeeze out another turn of multiple expansion - the stock can likely climb to $50 (7.5x EV/FTM revenues) without too much trouble.Talend offers investors access to an international, high-growth tech play as well as a way to capitalize on the economic recovery in Europe, where Talend does the majority of its business. The U.S. stock indices (especially the NASDAQ) have outperformed in a big way this year, causing more investors to rotate into international plays.With its big data software addressing a large and growing use case, and on the back of solid fundamental results and expanding profit margins, Talend is a solid choice for a long-term, internationally minded technology portfolio.Talend is best known for its flagship product, the Talend Data Fabric. Gartner, the leading software industry analyst, has named Talend a Leader in the Data Integration Tools space, which basically helps businesses stitch together data streams from a variety of sources and prepare them for analysis.Talend Data Fabric brings together data across a variety of enterprise systems as well as device endpoints (such as phones and desktops) into a single environment, ready for ad-hoc analysis. Businesses continue to generate massive amounts of data, and not always in compatible formats - Talend's ""data blending"" capabilities render the data in a usable format. Data Fabric also works and can be installed across cloud and on-premise environments, and can grab data from both environments as well. The company also has a self-described ""drag-and-drop"" interface that simplifies the data blending process and removes the need for complex code.The set of slides below, taken from Talend's investor deck, showcases the different types of data that Data Fabric can bring under one roof. Instead of using custom code to build one-to-one connections across all these data endpoints, Data Fabric can bind the data together in a low-code, self-service process:Citing a study by Forrester Research, a software industry research firm, Talend believes the market for data integration software to be $17 billion, indicating that it has barely cracked one percent of this market. Other competitors in the space include IBM (NYSE: IBM), Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL), and Informatica. However, with the exception of Informatica, the majority of Talend's competitors are tech conglomerates with a variety of product lines and no special focus on data integration; Talend's exclusive focus on data integration has given it strong brand recognition as a thought leader in the space.Talend is a good old-fashioned SaaS subscription company, with ~85% of its revenue derived from long-term, recurring revenue subscriptions. The company also offers perpetual licenses to a small subset of its clients.According to the company's F-1, Talend subscriptions are priced on a per-user basis, like the majority of other SaaS software products. Like a fellow big data company, Cloudera (NASDAQ: CLDR), Talend offers a ""freemium"" version of its application with a limited feature set in the hopes of attracting paid customers. Also like fellow SaaS companies, Talend employs a ""land and expand"" sales model - getting into the door at a new prospect with a few deployments, with the hopes of signing up more users over time. Its net expansion rate, as of 3Q17, is 123% - indicating success in upsetting subscriptions to existing customers - and this metric has held above 120% since 2014.Talend heavily relies on its direct sales force, on which it spends ~60% of its revenue. It also has built an ecosystem of partners and resellers that sell Talend via its indirect channel. 50% of its FY16 revenue was generated in EMEA, 47% in the Americas, and the remaining small sliver in APAC - which is also its fastest-growing region. See its geographical revenue mix, taken from the F-1, in the table below:Figure 1. Talend international revenue mixAs of 3Q17, Talend cites a paid customer count of ""1,500+"" with a tilt toward large multinational clients, including Citigroup (NYSE: C) and General Electric (NYSE: GE). The slide below, taken from the company's investor deck, lists some of its anchor clients:Talend generated $106.0 million of revenue in FY16 (+40% y/y) and, as of its Q3 forecast, is expecting to generate $148.1-$149.1 million for FY17. At the midpoint of that range, Talend would achieve 40% y/y growth - representing no deceleration whatsoever from its FY16 growth rate.In Talend's most recent earnings release, the company posted $38.4 million in revenue (+40% y/y), ending out over Wall Street consensus of $37.6 million (+37% y/y). Despite the beat, shares moved sideways due to the concurrent announcement of the CFO's retirement, who had been in the job for eight years.Figure 2. Talend Q3 resultsSource: Talend earnings press releaseThough executive departures, in general, aren't great for business stability, the departure of a CFO (at least in an enterprise software company) is much less disruptive than the departure of a sales leader (often COO), so investors should quickly get over their jitters.Talend has a high 77% gross margin (as of year-to-date 2017), and that's trending up relative to 76% in the prior year-to-date period. The company's operating losses of -$18.0 million in YTD 2017 imply an operating margin of -17%, a major operating leverage improvement over -26% in the first nine months of 2016.A large portion of this expense is non-cash, however, due to stock-based comp, and the company is virtually breakeven in cash flow, generating a small OCF loss of -$0.9 million in the first nine months of 2017.Talend's Q3 adjusted EPS (which adjusts for net income by adding back stock comp and one-time items) of -$0.11 handily beat Wall Street consensus of -$0.19, showing that the company is capable of beating on both the top and bottom lines.Talend is a lesser-known stock that's been a consistent high performer since its IPO. If we assume the company can grow revenues at 35% for the next twelve months (recall that the company actually didn't decelerate growth at all in FY17), we can estimate $185 million in forward revenues for Talend - implying a 6.4x EV/FTM revenues multiple on its current market cap of ~$1.3 billion less $91 million of net cash.Talend is still a small/mid-cap company, and it's also internationally based - which checks off a lot of diversification boxes in a balanced portfolio. Its valuation, while not terribly cheap, still sits below a number of other high-growth software companies within its profile such as Coupa (NASDAQ: COUP) at 7.7x and 43% revenue growth, BlackLine (NASDAQ: BL) at 8.1x and 42% growth, and Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) at 8.7x and 63% growth. Given the richness of its peer valuation, Talend still has room to muscle up its valuation to at least 7.5x EV/FTM revenues ($50, implying 15% upside). The stock probably won't double again anytime soon, but it offers stable growth and diversification backed by solid fundamentals.Big data, aside from being a major buzzword in tech circles, is a real and growing need among enterprises who are figuring out how to unlock value in their massive data stores for the first time. Data integration services like Talend are a vital component of this process, and tech industry analysts (such as Gartner) and Wall Street alike have optimistic sector views. According to Yahoo Finance, 7 out of 8 of Talend's covering analysts rate it as a Buy or above, with only 1 at Hold. Their mean price target is $51, indicating Wall Street's general consensus that Talend is moderately undervalued.Expect Talend to continue doing well."
4195661,103480,2018-08-07T08:00:17-04:00,"Talend shares dropped nearly 10% after its Q2 results came in-line with analyst expectations, and forward-looking guidance was so-so.Talend isn't yet cheap at ~7x forward revenues, but further selling pressure could create a buying opportunity for the shares.On the bright side for Talend: the company's land-and-expand model is working, with net retention above 120% for the 17th consecutive quarter.Strong repeat business has helped Talend to boost FCF and improve pro forma operating margins.","By now, double-digit selloffs in the technology sector are a common occurrence so far in the Q2 earnings season. First it happened only to the Internet giants - Netflix (NFLX), Facebook (FB), and Twitter (TWTR) - but recently, the contagion has spread as well to the small and mid-cap SaaS sector. Going through the earnings of the likes of Instructure (INST) and Tableau (DATA), the trend seems clear - good just isn't good enough. When tech valuations, especially for growth stocks, being as high as they are, investors aren't content with seeing in-line results or small beats to Wall Street consensus.Talend (TLND), the French big data software company, is no stranger to poor earnings reactions. This is the third consecutive quarter that Talend's shares have dropped after an earnings announcement, though this quarter's nearly 10% selloff is one of the worst instances. Talend follows a puzzling trend in the big data space - despite the supposed increasing importance of big data companies in the IT fabric, and the growing trend of enterprises turning to their data as a key source of decision-making guidance, big data stocks have not done well in recent quarter. Investors have placed heavy emphasis on driving up the stocks of frontend, application-based SaaS companies - but infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) names have largely traded flat. Cloudera (CLDR) is the biggest example of this, though some of the pressure is due to a real company-issue sales warning. Still, Hadoop as a technology is gaining in popularity and should be given more credit - same goes to Teradata (TDC), the big data warehousing company that reported last week and got similarly crushed despite decent results. So Talend isn't alone among its peers in facing an uphill battle to win investor's appreciation. But in my view, the general apathy toward the big data space is misguided. Once investors come to terms with the fact that a huge valuation gap exists between popular, easy-to-understand SaaS names like Avalara (AVLR), Docusign (DOCU), and Zuora (ZUO) (each of which are trading at double-digit revenue multiples) and the more technical, ""boring"" IaaS stocks, the latter group might receive a bit more love. This isn't to say, however, that Talend is necessarily cheap. The stock has been on an upward trend since the beginning of the year - it tends to rise between quarters, and then retrace some of its gains after it reports earnings results. Based on this trend, I'd say there's a decent opportunity in taking advantage of Talend's dip to make a gain. TLND data by YChartsPost-earnings, Talend shares dropped from $58 to $53, and at that share price, Talend carries a market cap of $1.54 billion. Netting out the company's $93 million of balance sheet cash and negligible $1 million of debt, the company has an enterprise value of $1.45 billion.Against Talend's refreshed guidance range of $204.6-$206.6 million for FY18 (a respectable +38% y/y growth rate at the midpoint, and $2 million or 1% higher than a prior midpoint of $203.6 million), this represents a valuation of 7.1x EV/FY18 revenues. That's about one turn cheaper than where the stock was trading post-Q1 earnings. I'm not under any illusion that Talend is marvelously cheap, like some other beaten-down names in small-cap SaaS (my top picks at the moment in this fallen-angel category include ed-tech software company Instructure (INST) and BI tool Domo (DOMO)). But there is upside here, especially as shares are about 15% down from recent highs. I would wait to see if continued selling pressure can lead to an entry point below $50 (6.7x FY18 revenues), but ultimately I believe Talend has the capacity to rebound to $59, representing a price target of 8x EV/FY18 revenues. Given where the market has headed with high-growth SaaS companies in the 30-40% growth bucket, with multiples in the 7-10x range (double digits being the more likely, given the rich valuations of recent IPOs), that's a fair price for Talend to shoot for. That price is 11% above current trading levels and 10% lower than all-time highs of ~$65.Here's a look at Talend's Q2 results:Figure 1. Talend Q2 earningsSource: Talend investor relationsIn my view, Talend's Q2 print wasn't bad, and certainly not bad enough to warrant a ~10% selloff. Total revenues grew 39% y/y to $349.8 million, decelerating somewhat from the 42% y/y growth that Talend had achieved in Q1. However, Talend's growth this quarter is still three points higher than the growth rate at which it exited Q4 (36% y/y). It's more than likely that this optical deceleration was due to the fact that a deal or two got pulled in to Q1, or more deals than expected pushed out of Q2. From these results - and especially given a boosted guidance range that calls for 38% y/y growth in Q2 - it doesn't seem that Talend's core business is struggling at all. And Talend also managed a beat, albeit small, to Wall Street's expectations of $49.2 million (+37% y/y). One of the most salient points in the quarter is the fact that dollar-based net retention rate remained ""above 120%"" for the 17th consecutive quarter. For subscription companies like Talend that have reached a rather mature customer base, upsells to the existing installed base often contribute more to revenue growth than new business does, so the maintenance of its high upsell rate is extremely encouraging. On the company's earnings call, CEO Mike Tuchen also called out strong upsell activity with financial services clients (which, needless to say, are a lucrative source of billings), including TD Bank (AMTD). On the product momentum side, Talend also seems to be doing just fine. The company launched enhanced enterprise capabilities in its Summer 2018 release, and was additionally recognized by Gartner as a Leader in its space for the third consecutive year. As SaaS investors know, Gartner rankings - particularly for those companies who can earn the top Leader distinction for several years in a row - have a large impact on swaying IT decision-makers' buying process.One area that investors could be picking at is a slight drop in gross margins. Gross margin on both an IFRS and pro forma basis dropped to 76% and 77%, respectively, each one point lower than the prior year. This is due in part to a ~50% lift in professional services costs, which is a revenue stream that is largely performed at cost to entice customers in the door. But then again, it's only a one-point shift, so investors shouldn't be too concerned. This is especially true as Talend has made tremendous progress on operating margins. Pro forma operating margins improved six points to just -7%, edging very close to breakeven:Figure 2. Talend operating margin improvementsSource: Talend investor relationsIn addition, despite a small dip in FCF for Q2, the company's first-half free cash flows still improved by nearly 4x relative to the first half of last year.Figure 3. Talend FCFSource: Talend investor relationsWith an FCF margin of 3.3%, there's certainly still work to be done. Dropbox (DBX) set the bar high when it went public earlier this year, showing off an FCF margin near the 30% range. But Talend is still early in its maturity, and relative to other high-growth SaaS companies of a similar size, the fact that it can produce positive FCF at all is a plus.Talend is a solid software company growing at nearly 40% and making incremental progress on the bottom line, as evidenced both by its operating margin expansion ad its FCF growth. Shares were slightly expensive last quarter as they neared 8x forward revenues, but with the selloff this quarter, there is an opportunity to ride the rebound in Talend. Looking longer-term, the company's big data orientation and the well-reviewed status of its product give it a defensible moat to grow from. Look for an entry point in this name if selling pressure continues."
4085276,98236,2017-07-02T00:19:27-04:00,"Talend shares have appreciated significantly in the first half of the year.The company is continuing to gain market share at an increasing space within the data integration market.Last quarter the company saw opportunities to accelerate growth by ""pre-hiring"" salesmen from its principle competitors.The data integration space has seen accelerated growth because of the rise of big data analytics.This company has developed a suite of solutions that are specifically tailored to the fastest growing segments within data analytics.","Getting up-to-date on TalendTalend (NASDAQ:TLND) is a small company - similar in size and impact to those that used to reside on the fringes of the IT investment world. The company has been public since last July, and I wrote about it a couple of months after that. It is only covered by 8 analysts these days, so the company is still little known. But a couple of readers have asked for an update, and here one is.In terms of operational performance, Talend continues to surprise to the upside as will be outlined below. Reported revenues, which grew by 44% last quarter, were strong, but in fact the growth in proxy bookings was stronger. Overall, the rate of increase in deferred revenues continued to accelerate, and did so in a seasonally weak quarter for that metric. The company’s visibility was such that it elected to pre-hire when compared to its operating plan and hence saw a rapid increase in sales and marketing spend. That said, management says it is committed to a balance pattern of investment in which it tries to balance growth opportunities and the need to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future,The company also has announced the first Apache Beam-powered solution for self-service data prep. Data prep is a relatively small component of Talend’s business currently, but it is likely to increase in significance. The solution it announced last winter appears to both differentiate the overall Talend offering and to have led to some specific customer wins. Talend's focus on Hadoop and big data analytics is a key differentiator for the company and it appears to be executing on this strategy. Cutting to the chase, the shares were interesting when I first wrote about them and a relative value at that time. The shares are still interesting today, although the share price appreciation has certainly increased valuation both on an absolute and relative basis. I think the shares are still a value at the current share price - partially because the operational outlook has improved and partially because the shares, when viewed on a relative basis, have not seen the kind of dramatic outperformance that might lead one to conclude they have spiked. The key issue for me is that the company’s outlook has visibly improved, both in terms of near-term guidance but also in terms of its longer-term market share potential. Talend has followed the share price pattern of many other hyper-growth names and probably will continue to do so in the near term. While handicapping specific events in an earnings release and their probable impact on near term operational performance is far more of an art than a science, I think the indication that the company accelerated its salesforce hiring plans and was able to poach A+ players from the legacy data integration players is probably more significant than is reflected in the company's current valuation. Back in March, the company had a follow-on offering for selling shareholders. The offering was for 3.3 million shares + a 500k share add on. The shares were sold at a price of $28.50, which was actually a premium to the price of the shares at the time the secondary was completed. Presumably, the secondary has cleaned up any potential overhang from Talend’s VCs, although insiders, as a whole, still retain about half of the outstanding shares of this company.""Little-known"" has certainly not meant ""overlooked"" by growth investors. The shares have performed strongly since the time of their IPO, which was about 11 months ago. In fact, the shares have appreciated by almost 55% so far this year and have blasted through many of the price targets reported to First Call.Despite the significant share price appreciation in the several months, I feel investors should put this name on their radar screen and look forward to building a position. It has the opportunity to enjoy hyper-growth for a considerable time period and to become the best of breed alternative in the large and growing of data integration. The shares aren’t cheap, but I feel that estimates will be steadily rising to justify the valuation. The company has avoided the use of any substantial use of share based compensation and it has experienced a substantial growth in deferred revenue balancesPart of the company’s share price performance has been a product of the company exceeding growth targets, basically since it has been a public company. Revenues were up 44% last quarter (47% on a constant currency basis), which is a percentage growth rate significantly greater than that which it had been achieving before it went public. This is a company that is now based in the US, but it was founded in France by a couple of entrepreneurs with backgrounds in the SI world. In fact, last quarter, the company had more than 50% of its license business in the America’s for the first time and it is growing somewhat more rapidly in the US than in EMEA reaching 49% growth in the US last quarter.Because of its genesis as a French company, Talend reports its results based on IFRS standards, which is essentially the same as US GAAP. It also reports results based on a non-IFRS presentation, which excludes stock based compensation. One is hard-pressed to escape that particular malady in any corner of the globe, although as mentioned, stock based comp. currently at $1 million/quarter represents just 3% of total revenue. One wonders if the aborigines in Australia record the results of making arrows and spears in a non-IFRS presentation to appeal to their various constituenciesAt the moment, of the 8 analysts reporting their rating, 7 have the shares rated a buy or strong buy and 1 analyst has the shares rated as a whole. Like many enterprise technology vendors that have recently gone public, the company is currently achieving exceptional results, but, on the other hand, those results have been mainly forecasted by the company and the consensus is one calling for a reversion to more modest growth starting later this year. The company has made what can best be called plodding steps toward profitability - better than some and worse than a whole lot of other similarly situated companies. While the company modestly beat revenue expectations in its last reported quarter in the wake of a modest currency head wind and did see some operating leverage at scale, reported EPS was a small miss. The company increased its revenue expectations for the full year by about 2%-3%, but it did not decrease the expectations it has had regarding abating its losses on either a IFRS or non-IFRS basis.So where might the beef be for this company? Simply put, it is the leader in second-generation data integration software. That market is still growing at 14% a year. The company has major functional differentiation when compared to legacy solutions in the space (its technology has been derived from an open source model) and seems to have advantages in terms of TCO because of its pricing and packaging compared to the large, legacy vendors. It has a trivial market share of just about 2%, which suggests that it has a lengthy runway of growth as it is self-evidently a disruptor and market share gainer. Its competitors belong to much larger organizations or, in the case of market leader Informatica, have been bought by private equity. As the cloud impacts workloads, and as users need to make a choice on new data integration solutions, for re-designed and new workloads, this company has the opportunity to dramatically increase its market share, and I think that is basically the case I will try to delineate below.Data Integration - Does Talend really have significant differentiation to keep gaining share and enjoying hyper-growth?I think for those readers interested in this name that is the principle question. I have no reason to doubt that the company will enjoy leverage at scale at some reasonable cadence. There already has been some, despite the earnings miss last quarter. The issue for this company, as is the case for so many other smaller IT vendors, is whether they have a solution that is differentiated enough, with enough benefits to users, in order to continue to gain market share.For a little background to those readers not familiar with this market space, data integration as a category has been around for many years. The fact is that most users store their data in multiple formats, even if most often those formats have been Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)-centric. And of course, data is read in diverse ways depending on the specific application being considered. So there has always been a need for software that could put data into a consistent format that can be read by different applications and stored in different data bases. In addition, data has to be “cleansed.” No, not with Ajax or Comet or something like that, but frequently data entry has errors and incorrect data is then stored. Needless to say, that can represent a major problem. So software has been developed, initially using check-digit technology, that facilitated the ability users have to ensure that the data going into their applications comes from an accurate source.There are many, many other complexities when it comes to cleansing and integrating data. For readers interested in more details, the Gartner report linked here provides a more in-depth view. I would specifically point out to readers that requirements for data integration have grown because of the need for data consistency between different operational applications, because of the need for Interenterprise data sharing and because of the use cases that involve support for governance and management of data assets. But, of course, the largest demand driver, beyond those mentioned above in the Gartner report, has been the explosion of big data analytics and the need to ensure that these analytic applications are fed with integrated and cleansed data.As can be seen by looking at the two linked reports, there is a difference in estimates of both the size of the market and growth rates, with Gartner’s studs being significantly less than the study by Cision. That is usually a function of definitions. From the point of view of trying to analyze the opportunities for Talend, I think the broader definition better describes their opportunities and the areas of focus. Not too surprisingly, the on-demand consumption model, which is the primary delivery model of Talend, is seeing the greatest percentage growth. It is a lot easier to grow rapidly if a vendor is offering solutions packaged the way users today, want to consume what is on offer.For many years, the data integration market has been dominated by two companies, Informatica and Ascential Software. Informatica went private about 2 years ago, at which time its revenue had reached a run-rate of $1.2 billion. Ascential Software has been owned by IBM for more than a decade - it had been about 35% smaller than Informatica before it was bought. The other two significant competitors in the space have been SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle. Oracle’s solution is based on an older acquition and SAP’s product was internally developed. The products offered by SAP and Oracle are less robust than best of breed offerings and are primarily bought as part of an overall transaction with either SAP or Oracle.Basically, the data integration market has not been disrupted for many years and it has been ripe for its own transformation. (Many industry participants call the software in this space ETL, which stands for Extract, Transform and Load). Much of the growth this company is likely to achieve is through the capturing of existing ETL users who need more capabilities at a reasonable price then they can find from legacy vendors.The company’s CEO, when asked where new sales hires are coming from, said that ""it was really incredible how many of them were coming from some of the large competitors and that we saw that opportunity. ... [W]e decided to go ahead and just pull them in a few months earlier because the big, you know once a year annual training event that we do is a really nice way to frontload their ability to get successful."" Basically, it is fair to say that the people who have been selling the product for years have decided that the Talend solution has enough differentiation where they believe they will make more money selling it, than selling legacy products. It is really hard to find a stronger testament to differentiation than something like that, particularly when hiring these sales people on an expedited basis was the reason for the company missing its quarterly earnings expectations.One component of the company’s outlook relates to the company’s focus on big data in general and Hadoop particularly. Its software is optimized to work well with extra-large data sets and Hadoop. It is a material advantage enjoyed by Talend that is hard to replicate. Currently, the use of Talend with big data has reached 50% of subscription revenues and the CEO has forecast that it will reach more than two-thirds of subscription revenues by the end of the year.Just thinking about that particular metric in combination with the early sales hires last quarter, mainly from legacy data integration competitors, presents one reason why it seems likely that the company is going to exceed its guidance. In addition to the big data perspective, Talend is seeing a major percentage of its business coming from being a service provider for public cloud users. The CEO said that 30% of its business is coming from cloud -based use cases. Deals like those are far less competitive for Talend because the functionality required cannot be readily be done by legacy competitors.Another advantage of Talend is that it is agnostic between data sources. Clearly, the data integration capabilities of the application software vendors are simply not going to be deployed on the public cloud in isolation. And IBM’s product is also highly unlikely to even be sold for its ability to work on AWS or Microsoft Azure. Sometimes competitive moats take the form of market structure. In the case of Talend, one sees, technology focus, a market where innovation had been limited for several years, and now a favorable market structure.Talend is strongly differentiated in the segments of the data integration market that are growing the fastest-but beyond that, it is also usually the low-cost alternative. That isn’t all that surprising given the company’s genesis as an open-source provider.Gartner ranks Informatica highly. According to Gartner, Informatica has proven to rapidly adapt to market functionality demands and to have broad market presence in innovation around metadata management, big data and data lakes. But Gartner also says that Informatica’s hardware-based pricing and licensing models and perceived high TCO remains a key issue. Some users, according to Gartner have difficulty in understanding its (Informatica's) licensing methods and high costs relative to the competition. IBM is seen by Gartner as having similar issues regarding costs.Paths to ProfitabilityTalend is obviously still a small company, and smaller IT vendors with exclusively subscription models are unlikely to reach IFRS profitability all that rapidly. That is probably true for Talend as well.Certainly, last quarter was not one that showed material leverage at scale, although part of that has to do with specific, non-recurring events described in this article. Excluding those one-time items, the model showed some reasonable leverage. On the quarterly conference call, management was quite explicit that it was engaged in balancing growth and a path to profitability-and there is likely to be continuing tension between the two objectives.On an IFRS basis, sales and marketing expense grew by 33% last quarter as did research and development expense. General and administrative costs grew by 54% year on year, reflecting the expenses of running a public company coupled with the specific costs of the follow-on offering.Sequentially, research and development spending rose by 12%, general and administrative spending rose by 13% and sales and marketing expense rose by 5%. Most of the increase in general and administrative costs related to the costs of the follow-on offering; excluding that expense, general and administrative costs actually declined sequentially. Overall, operating expense was 97% of revenues which compares to 103% in the year earlier quarter and to 97% of revenues in Q4 2016.Gross margins slipped 100 bps year on year, primarily because of a rapid increase in professional service headcount. The company, because of its above-plan sales success, has both had to hire rapidly to augment future implementation capacity, and has had to rely on contractors and 3rd parties to perform installations at far lower margins than if it had trained personnel to complete assignments. Professional services revenues actually rose by more than 50% sequentially and given the company’s size, it is almost impossible to be able to handle that kind of incremental volume without turning to partners and contractors for assistance. That, in turn, will have the impact of lowering gross margins.When I look at the P&L guidance holistically, I would be surprised if the company weren’t able to over attain its current forecast for earnings. The company had a non-IFRS loss last year of about $21 million. It currently is forecasting that it’s non-IFRS loss this year will be $22 million. On an IFRS basis, the company had a loss of $24 million, which is forecast to grow to around $30 million this year, despite greater revenues. I simply think that matching the rate of expense growth to the rate of revenue growth for the balance of the year will produce stronger results than those forecast. All that said, however, I would be surprised if there are investors who are buying these shares because of some analysis of Talend's DPV in terms of reported earnings. Earnings are still a couple of years away at best and I am sure that analysts recommending the shares use a variety of growth rate assumptions and time periods for hyper-growth in their analysis. ValuationA couple of days ago, a contributor to Seeking Alpha wrote an article that suggested that it is 1999 all over again. Presumably, the valuation of a company such as Talend was part of the argument the contributor was making. For what it is worth, my view is quite different.Having been an analyst during that period and having had to deal with what were supposed to be hyper-growth names, my personal experience contradicts the thesis presented. There are simply too many specific points of difference between the stock trading events of 1999 - through the early days of 2000 and the current strength in tech names for the argument to resonate with me. The argument that those who neglect history are obliged to relive it is a well-worn bromide - but the reverse is equally true-the events of 20 years ago or so simply do not match up to the current environment.I mention all of this because a company such as Talend did not exist nor could have existed in that time. Talend has revenues, a business model and financial metrics that are credible. Those metrics do not portray some deep value for this company to be sure, but neither do they suggest that investors have lost their understanding of what shares are worth. I don’t think that an article about a specific company is a place to discuss the particular article linked here-but for those readers who accept its premise, investing or even thinking about Talend would be foolish.There are assorted styles of investing - none of them is exclusively right on what makes a worthwhile investment and certainly none of them are right all of the time. I would try to say that the investment case in Talend is timely - regardless of its perceived valuation - because of the rapid growth of the data integration market and in particular the big data requirements which is the economic foundation on which demand for Talend solutions rests. That growth is accelerating materially now and that is the most likely reason why Talend's revenue growth has been and is likely to continue to exceed expectations. It might be nice if that phenomenon happened during a period of less ebullient tech stock valuation - but it would also be unlikely.The reason to own the shares is because Talend is gaining significant share in data integration and the most up-to-date news from the company suggest (hiring extra sales people on an accelerated basis) that this trend will persist. And no, you can’t quantify what that is worth using some DPV formula - it doesn’t really work for many reasons.I will simply present the standard valuation metrics - well, other than EPS, as this company doesn’t have that - and wrap up the article. Talend is for those investors who invest in long-term trends. It Is for investors who want to ride waves. But it will not screen.As of this writing, the company, using the 29 million average weighted shares the CFO has forecast, the company has a market cap of $1 billion. The company has a cash balance of just less than $100 million, leaving an enterprise value of $900 million. The currently published First Call consensus for revenues this year is $145 million. So that calculates to an EV/S of 6.2X. That is probably an average level for that metric in the cohort of hyper growth names; I think it is low because I see Talend sustaining 30%+ growth for several years while ultimately becoming a leader in its space and disrupting and gaining share vis-a-vis Informatica and IBM for a leadership position within the data integration space.The company probably will not achieve non-IFRS profitability until 2019. It does use a modest level of stock based comp which had been projected to be 7% of this year’s revenues. In Q1, stock based comp was just $1 million, or 3% of revenue and the company did not update its expectations for that metric. I think the path to profitability is relatively straight-forward and to an extent will depend on the balance the company chooses between maximizing growth and achieving profitability. For now, however, I imagine that most stakeholders and stockholders would like to see a bit faster top line growth while waiting a bit longer on profitability.The company generated a moderate level of free cash flow last year. Most of the positive cash flow was being driven by significant increases in the company’s deferred revenue balances. The increase in the deferred revenues increase grew by 2.5X last year.Obviously, deferred revenues and bookings are inextricably intertwined. The CFO declined to forecast bookings-again that is pretty common these days because doing so essentially requires second sight on the length of average contracts and renewal contracts. While the increase in the deferred revenue balance grew by 60% year on year last quarter, the Q1 deferred revenue increase was not great enough to match last year’s increase in deferred revenues in overall dollars. If management doesn’t choose to forecast that metric it would be foolish on my part to attempt to make a guess.All in, however, it seems to me that based on some trends and on seasonality, I expect that the company could generate $$10-$15 million of free cash flow this year. That would be driven by increases in stock based comp and continued robust performance in deferred revenues and by a smaller IFRS loss. Without management discussion of the course of deferred revenue, and with so few quarters from which to draw a trend, I think all that can be said is that the company is likely to see noticeably greater free cash flow than reported earnings. But no one is seriously going to buy these shares because of their current level of free cash flow. This story will ultimately be about growth and the longer-term development of a 20%+ non-IFRS operating profit model.Talend shares have elicited 7 buys on First Call out of the 8 analysts that cover the name. It would obviously be better if there were more controversy amongst analysts or if the short ratio were more than negligible. It is a name that can either be bought opportunistically on a bad market day or positions could be assumed that are hedged with options. But I think that while it is not likely to see its shares increase another 54% in the second half of this year, operating results will be strong enough for the shares to deliver positive alpha."

(NASDAQ:TLND) - Sell or short recommendationThe 180-day lockup period for the Talend S.A. initial public offering is scheduled to expire on January 25, 2017. At that time, the company's pre-IPO shareholders and insiders will be able to sell >10 million shares, potentially flooding the market.The event could result in at least a temporary, sharp decrease in the price of shares for Talend, opening a potential opportunity for investors to sell or short shares of the company prior to the lockup period expiration.Business summary: Big Data company with its own proprietary platform for the integration of data((Source: Company website)Registered in Suresnes, France, Talend S.A.'s U.S. headquarters are located in Redwood City, California. It offers its proprietary platform, called Talend Data Fabric, to integrate data and applications across traditional business applications, Big Data and the cloud to make these more easily accessible for companies.The company has a global customer base, including such names as General Electric (NYSE: GE), Citi (NYSE: C), Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY). Talend reported 27.4 million of total revenues for the three-month period that ended on September 30, 2016. It reported a net loss of $6.37 million during the same period.Talend is valued on a P/S multiple at 6.6, slightly higher than the industry average of 5.0. Although the company has a market capitalization of just $647 million, it still lists diversified tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) among its direct competitors. These are valued at 5.9 and 4.4 on a P/S multiple basis, respectively.Executive managementThe chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors is Michael Tuchen. He has served as the company's CEO since January 2014. Before joining Talend, Tuchen served as the CEO of Rapid7 LLC from May 2008 to October 2012 and as a general manager of SQL server marketing for Microsoft from September 2003 to October 2006. Tuchen graduated from Brown University with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. He then earned a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering at Stanford University and a Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard University.Thomas Tuchscherer has served as the chief financial officer of Talend since June 2012. He has also served as the vice president of corporate development since January 2010. Tuchscherer previously worked at SAP AG as the vice president of operations and strategy and product and business strategy. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from McGill University, a DEC in commerce from John Abbott College and a Master of Business Administration degree from ESSEC Business School.Q3 Financial HighlightsDuring the third quarter, Talend enjoyed a 40 percent year-over-year increase in total revenues of $27.4 million. During the same quarter in 2015, it saw total revenues of 19.6 million. The company also reported that its revenue from subscriptions grew by 44 percent and its revenue from Big Data and cloud solutions grew by more than 100 percent year over year.Performance since its IPOTalend priced its shares at $18, which was $1 more than the upper limit of its marketed range of $15-17. On its market debut, it soared by 53 percent to open at $27.66. Since that time, the shares have peaked at $34.49. Talend closed at $23.40 on January 11, so it is up about 30 percent over its initial pricing.Conclusion: Sell or Short Prior To Lockup ExpirationTalend's strong early market performance and healthy revenue and subscription increases in the third quarter could combine to prompt the company's pre-IPO shareholders to take initial profits. Five firms and nineteen individuals hold over 10 million shares as noted above, previously restricted from trading.With just 5.3 million shares initially offered, if even some of these insiders sell, it could result in a sharp decline in the price, presenting a good opportunity for investors to sell before the lockup period expiration or to short the stock.As we've highlighted previously, we have observed abnormal negative returns in the two weeks surrounding many lockup expirations. We are keen on Talend's strong and diverse pre-IPO shareholders, strong debut, and tech focus, all of which could support a short play because the insiders can now sell their shares at a big gain.We suggest investors consider a short position one week prior to the event and lasting for two days after.Don Dion's IPO Insights provides up-to-date information and analysis on the major IPOs each week, along with additional opportunities to invest and short these stocks at their quiet period and lockup period expirations, respectively.

4012659,98236,2016-10-17T23:10:29-04:00,"Talend has become a disruptor in the data integration space.It went public at a share price of $18, then went to $33 and is now back to where it started trading at $24/share.The company has a far more reasonable valuation than most of the other recent IPOs in the information technology space.It has been seeing accelerating growth and appears to have reasonable expense discipline for a company of its size.Talend has been able to create a significant level of differentiation in the data integration space through the approach of its unified data fabric.","Talend - Small Company, Big Space, Big Opportunity?Talend (NASDAQ:TLND) is yet another company that went public about 3 months ago to take advantage of what some consider a tech bubble. It is a relatively small company at this point, but unlike some of its brethren, it has not seemingly had the extreme valuation excesses that have marked many recent offerings. Talend was recently upgraded by a GS analyst.Perhaps more importantly, the company's shares have been substantially oversold, according to those who look at things like relative strength indexes. Talend is covered by 6 analysts at the moment, and all of those except one were in the underwriting group. So, I thought the SA community might be interested in a less biased look at the outlook for the company and whether or not the shares are worth getting to know.Talend will be releasing its earnings for the second time as a public company on 11/10. Expectations are for a loss, for this quarter, this year and next year as well. The covering analysts mostly rate it as a hold, other than GS and one other boutique brokerage. The company is seeing sequential growth that is accelerating, with its year-over-year growth reaching 38% last quarter compared to 34% in the prior quarter. Talend looks at a metric that is key to a company like this which it calls ""dollar-based expansion,"" and which was 124% on the high side of its experience over the past 9 quarters. The growth in sequential operating expense diminished substantially, perhaps leading to some optimism regarding a path to profitability in the foreseeable future. The company is generating massive levels of deferred revenue relative to its size, and because of that, it has already become breakeven in terms of cash flow from operations (CFFO). Management has forecast that the free cash flow generation will positive for all of 2016 and beyond.Talend was founded in France, but it is headquartered in Redwood City, CA. It reports using IFRS standards that are equivalent to US GAAP. Currently, more than 50% of the company's revenues are coming from outside of the US, which suggests it has a pretty substantial geographic runway to accelerate sales growth in this country. On the other hand, currency fluctuations will be more noticeable for this company than is the case for some of the other names in the software space.Talend raised about $91 million in its IOP, and shares are trading about 1/3rd above the offering priced. The company's first quarterly report covered the period through June 30th before it raised capital and shows a small cash balance offset by some slightly larger level of borrowings. Presumably, the borrowings have been retired and the company has a significant balance of cash and equivalents. There would appear to be no operating reason that it has to raise more capital in the foreseeable future.The company is using a fully diluted share count of 27.5 million shares, which yields a current market capitalization of $687 million, and its current likely enterprise value is probably around $600 million. Talend's valuation is far lower than that of many other IPOs at less than 6X sales based on the current year forecast and 4.4X EV/S based on consensus forecast of $135 million in revenue for 2017.The title for this article comes from the show ""The King and I."" Late last week, King Bhumibol of Thailand passed away. I confess that I really don't have a great fund of knowledge about the king of a country I only have visited once. What little I did know about the man was that he was a friend to this country during the war in Vietnam, and his country was very hospitable to our servicemen in that period.In any event, one of the well-known songs from the show is called ""Getting to Know You."" And hence the title of the article, which is about getting to know Talend and seeing if the exercise is worthwhile. I think it is!What is Talend and why is it relevant?Basically, the company offers a series of data integration tools that are part of a unified data integration fabric and allow users to create analytic applications, including those based on cloud data sources and Big Data volumes. There have been relatively few investments that are focused directly on the emerging trend of Big Data and analytic applications which have been enabled by that technology. It is the contention of this article that Talend is likely to be one of those companies. It competes against Informatica, owned by private equity and Ascential Software, which was in turn owned by IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) for many years.I wrote an article about Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP), which is a company that is trying to commercialize Hadoop adhering to open system standards. So far the old saying ""long and wrong"" characterizes the recommendation. But the point is that this company has some of the same demand drivers that have animated the revenue growth of HDP, and that portion of the company's business has seen triple-digit growth. The jury remains out regarding HDP, and investors will see if there has been any progress when the company reports its results early next month. But the space has some of the best prospects in the Enterprise IT universe. Talend is another company whose future is tied to that of Big Data and the cloud and to the increasing torrent of data that users want to analyze as part of their decision-making process. Part of the company's product offering is the ability to be used with Hadoop and, most particularly, Apache Spark as a vehicle to integrate data from that source as well as others. Talend is part of the Apache Spark eco-system and is used in many Apache Spark solutions.Talend has a far more flexible business model when compared to its better-known competitors that allow users to buy a low-cost platform license and then expand the range of functionality they can get from the platform. The leaders in the space - Informatica, Oracle and IBM - have long been criticized by users for inflexibility in pricing along with high TCO for anything beyond very simple applications.Talend is, as will be discussed below, a small company with lots of products in a very large market whose leaders have been somewhat resistant to some of the innovations that users are looking to have in order to implement Big Data applications that can provide the latest analytic technology to torrents of data. The company has developed an integrated data fabric that allows users to integrate data from many sources and to use it all kinds of applications, whether on-prem, in the cloud or in Big Data use cases. Surprisingly, its largest competitors cannot precisely do that.Unlike some of the claims that are made for Big Data technology, reducing infrastructure costs and improving performance for Big Data applications is measurable and something that is inevitably going to attract the attention of users - in this case, the users are CIOs. Infrastructure is not something that end users really see - all that concerns them is whether the tool works or it doesn't, how much it costs and how the tool plays into the performance of the application. If a tool is cheaper, if it is reliable in complex environments with many data sources and if it reduces the time necessary to cleanse and prepare data, it is something that can be readily sold to users. It appears that Talend's solutions ticks all of the boxes in terms of cost, functionality and ease of use.Do Talend's products really have a special sauce?In a single phrase, Talend does have some different ways to solve some common IT problems. The company makes some audacious claims with regard to the price/performance of its solution. The claims are a bit over-hyped, and while the company has TCO advantages compared to competitive offerings, its extreme claims are restricted to a few specific use cases. Talend does, however, have some compelling solutions that would appear to allow it to maintain high growth for some years to come and to successfully compete in a crowded market space.Much of the advantage the company enjoys in terms of TCO relates to the way it prices its product, which is not based on the amount of data being processed. The company sells its solutions total based on a subscription model, although not all of its solutions run exclusively in the cloud. That is a bit different than the other licensing models in use by its competitors. For many years, the data integration space has been very stable, with the same competitors and little market share movement. Talend is the first disruptor in this space in many years, and it thus has a significantly greater competitive runway than might otherwise be the case.It would appear from the analysis of Gartner and others that users are looking for something that is a bit more straightforward than the overly complex pricing models offered by legacy competitors. Because of the way the market space has evolved, the major competitors have wound up with siloed products that are not themselves well-integrated and lack some of the more modern features that users seem to crave. CEO Mike Tuchen, during the course of the earnings conference call, was asked about how the company has been and expects to be able to gain market share.I will synthesize and expand on his answer, which I do believe is what is happening in the space and which, in many ways, represents the argument for owning these shares. Data integration has been one of the better spaces in the enterprise software world for many years now. The concept of the data-driven enterprise is not new, and it requires that users integrate data from numerous sources in order for it to be processed by analytic applications. Because there has been a need, there have been data integration solutions for a very long time at this point. The market, as defined by Gartner, is not immense. Most of the players in the market - and that includes Talend as well - offer products that are outside the relatively cramped boundaries defined by Gartner.The latest report on the subject is one from Gartner dated 9/28/2016. The market, according to it, had a run rate of $2.8 billion at the end of last year and is growing at 10.5%. That may not sound terribly exciting, although the growth rate is obviously several times that of IT spending as a whole. But within that 10.5%, traditional ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) tools are showing very little growth, while tools relating to cloud apps and big data are seeing a CAGR of 40%+. Talend enjoys a growth rate of 100%+ in cloud/Big Data and a 40% growth rate overall. The company doesn't break out its revenues by segment, and the way it prices the product that wouldn't be practical, as Big Data/Cloud are features on the total Data Fabric platform. But I think Big Data/Cloud is about 25% of this company's revenue, growing at 100%, which suggests that part of the company's secret sauce as an investment is that it has a disproportionate amount of its business coming from the high-growth segment of its market.Informatica has been the leading company in the data integration space for many years now - at least as long as I can remember. That company has 3 platforms that it offers users, 2 of which have been acquired over the years and are not basically integrated with the core offering called PowerCenter. PowerCenter has been around for a long time by now, and it is available in multiple flavors. But Informatica has totally different products for cloud data integration and Big Data management. That just isn't what users want to buy these days, no matter how happy they are with Informatica (the same comments would apply to IBM/Ascential, but it is a smaller fraction of the market). Gartner has mentioned that even some Informatica reference customers have had issues with both product messaging and portfolio architecture. Apparently, the company has reference customers who have confusion regarding how to add functionality and data delivery styles to their current deployments.The Talend offering consists of a single data fabric which is the core of its solution. The so-called secret sauce is essentially an integrated platform which allows the company to offer users the potential to do more with its tools without the necessity of owning 3 sets of non-integrated data integration solutions. The company users pays a 20-30% uplift to the price of the core technology and gets the total functionality necessary to achieve data integration in the cloud and for Big Data analytics. There are observers who would rather see Talend price on the amount of data that goes through the applications that its tools are used to build. But that is where the company is able to enjoy a price/performance advantage compared to competitors.The company has just started to sell what it describes as a data preparation component of its solution. Data preparation is a major component of the TAM this company addresses. Data preparation can be used by a whole raft of professionals in organizations, and its seat potential is said to be 30X that of professional developers. The Talend product is priced at 30% of the seat price of its traditional enterprise offering. Its competitors all sell different elements of data preparation separately, since basically they acquired those technologies through acquisition. This will be another significant differentiator for Talend, as the capability is part of its core platform. Obviously, data preparation has been part of data integration almost since the beginning, but it has always been part of a different silo. That has apparently been disagreeable for some users, at least according to Gartner.The company offers a free version that can be trialed and a subscription version that is sold. I expect that the revenue from data preparation will be noticeable as a growth driver by the end of the year and into 2017.The company has seen some acceleration of its growth most recently, perhaps as it has become better known with more references, and perhaps it has gotten more positive reviews from the larger analysts such as Gartner, IDC and Forrester. The availability of its data preparation solution is likely to further accelerate its growth rate. But it isn't as though there is some specific growth rate that has been either articulated or agreed upon by all observers. In looking at the financials and the valuation, I will use the consensus with the expectation that it is meant to embody conservative expectations that can be overattained.Some thoughts on valuation and the company's path to profitabilityMost tech companies that go public do so without earning or positive cash flow, making them more than a bit difficult to value. But it was ever thus, as the saying goes in the IPO market, and while this year saw a far smaller crop of new issues than usual, the crop that showed up lacked much in the way of standard financials that might be used in a valuation matrix. Talend is no real exception.Before taking a deeper dive in the pool, it should be pointed out that the company did not miss its first quarter in terms of earnings. It had a capital structure that included a large slug of convertible preferred shares. Those were converted as part of the IPO process. So, Talend used a larger number of shares to compute its loss, which was therefore smaller than would otherwise be the case. Its results coming out of the gate were a beat, as might be expected, and actually were a larger beat than many other companies enjoy in similar situations. The other thing to note is that at least initially, it is not going to offer billings guidance. Management stated that there are some puts and takes with regard to some of the specific components that would be used to calculate billings that are not representative of the company's actual performance. Many analysts and this observer prefer to see billings, but that will not be happening in the short term for Talend.The company computed its losses using 23.4 million shares in Q2, and will use a weighted average share count of 27.5 million shares, reflecting the IPO process going forward. In terms of valuation, I have used that number of shares and have estimated that most of the IPO balance is retained as cash on the balance sheet.Talend's specific commentary on expenses was rather sparse, particularly as it related to a path to profitability. But from my own perspective, there are certainly some green shoots visible. Company CFO Tom Tuscherer mainly looked at expenses year on year in his prepared remarks. And indeed, sales and marketing expenses increased by 57%, research and development expense increased by 28% and general and administrative expense increased by 51%, reflecting the costs of the IPO. Gross margins remained flat at 75%, and that seems a number that is consistent with gross margin levels of much larger SaaS companies.But for a high-growth company I think looking at sequential changes in spend and revenue make more sense. Just to reprise revenue growth on a sequential basis, it reached 12% last quarter, and in the prior year it was 8%. Talend has forecast that sequential growth was 4% in the summer quarter, and that it will be 11% in Q4. So, the company appears to be achieving growth rates that trend to more than 40% this year and suggest that assumptions for 2017 which call for 30% growth are quite conservative.Sales and marketing expense, despite the very strong growth of Q2 bookings on which commissions are paid and recognized before revenues start to flow, grew by 8.6%. Research and development spending actually dropped by 7.5% sequentially. General and administrative costs were very elevated because this is a small company and the cost of an IPO is large. Nonetheless, general and administrative expense grew by just 10% in the quarter, still below the growth in sequential revenues. It should be noted that general and administrative costs included a charge paid to Square One - not Square (NYSE:SQ) - as a success fee because of the successful IPO. The success fee was about 7% of reported general and administrative costs in Q2 and was a one-time event.Given the company's size and the fact that it is continuing geographic expansion into Australia, Singapore, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, I think the expense ratios demonstrate a strong level of cost discipline that augurs well for future profitability. Overall, Talend is forecasting an IFRS loss of about $29 million for the full year. On that basis, it lost $13.3 million in the first half, and it is forecasting to lose $7.5 million in the quarter it is soon to report. Given the Q3 revenue seasonality, I expect the potential upside from that forecast to be small. On the other hand, I think the Q4 loss forecast is probably a bit more conservative than is warranted, given the strong sequential revenue growth anticipated. I think the set-up is good in terms of expecting significant earnings upside prints in terms of earnings, and I believe the overall momentum and the impact of the new product introduction can well produce some revenue upside as well.As mentioned earlier, the company is forecasting positive free cash flow for this year, which suggests that the derived bookings metric is going to be strong, driven by further outsize growth in the deferred revenue balance. The CFO has suggested that such a level of growth in deferred revenues is most likely not sustainable, because this year is seeing a level of renewals that relates to contract signings three years ago. Talend is trying to reduce the length of its subscription contracts and to avoid the level of advance billings that had been on its balance sheet.Overall, I can readily see how the current analyst consensus, which is based on 30% growth next year and a loss that is cut in half has room, is likely to see substantial upside revision as next year wears on. Talend should be able to sustain growth of well above 30% and to achieve profitably within the next 6-8 quarters on the track it is going, and that is probably worth a share value quite a bit more than 4X revenues. I think the company has every likelihood of producing significant positive alpha both in the short and the long term, and it is not inconceivable that it will be acquired."
4007245,52382,2016-09-20T07:57:45-04:00,"Investor hopes are high from the new data integration specialist that is using open source technologies.Shrugging off the recent miss/miscommunication may be a mistake since the business has yet to overcome other challenges like profitability, competition or lack of scale.With limited catalysts to offset the doubts raised by a miss or miscommunication, sentiment around the stock may continue to be weak.","Talend S.A. (TLND) stock has attracted significant investor attention, especially if one looks at the trading multiple. Investor interest is fueled by hot themes like Cloud and Big Data, but to believe that the business is completely immune or isolated from the challenges associated with the typical data integration business may be a mistake and a rich valuation, combined with other emerging challenges, does urge caution.The Long thesis is largely built upon the company's unparalleled position in the data integration tools market, given the solutions are built on popular open source technologies like Apache and Hadoop, and with the growing number of corporations migrating away from premise-based integration tools towards open-source and Cloud-based tools, the business does stand to monetize the tailwinds associated with the same. Much of the senior management is from well-respected software companies and the business is cash flow positive on an operating basis and may continue to attract an acquisition premium because of the multi-year technological lead that the business enjoys. All in all, not an easy Short and the business may be a good buy down the road when the market appropriately discounts the challenges.But right now, the challenges, especially relative to market expectations, seem high enough to warrant caution. Even though there is a lot of confusion about the recent results and whether or not the company has missed the Street estimates, which may be unsettling considering this was the company's first quarterly result after the public offering, the results definitely failed to impress. The unimpressive results and lack of consistent profitability stand in stark contrast to the valuation premium that the business enjoys over existing data integration tools market leaders, e.g. Informatica that was acquired for 4.5 times expected revenue by a consortium consisting of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) among others. Lack of scale, competition, etc., are some of the other challenges that the business faces, but are not fully discounted by the market.Miss or miscommunication, both look equally badAfter a more than 20% decline in the stock price post-results, the case is being made that the earnings miss was more of a case of miscommunication due to the number of shares outstanding used in Street estimates and the Street not looking at the pro-forma numbers. If one adjusts for all those one-offs, the loss per share does come out 3-4 cents better than the estimates, but to believe that the disappointment is limited to investors not looking at the correct number in the press release may be naive, if not completely misguided.First of all, if one looks at the background of the senior management, which includes experience at investment banks and venture capital firms, it will be hard to believe in miscommunication or poor Street management thesis alone. Secondly, the guidance of a net loss of $0.93-1.01 per share for the year against the estimates of 97 cents is hardly impressive. With sales of barely $100 million for the year, a relatively smaller scale is another challenge that may continue to haunt the business for a while, especially in light of the strength of competitors in the space, i.e. names like Informatica, IBM (NYSE:IBM), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Although correcting fast, but the shortage of employees with deep experience in open source technologies is another factor that has the potential to rock the boat and needs to the watched."

Can it be the jump-start the industry needs?Tech IPO darlings like Talent, Acacia and Twilio are down about 30% from their highs. But does the valuation warrant more downside?","What's Up With GoPro and Amazon?GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) was on the upswing not all that long ago, particularly after the company introduced new cameras and a drone product in mid-September. However, shares have struggled mightily this month, down almost 20% in October.Not helping matters is the decline on Thursday when it was reported that ""the company has stopped shipping to Amazon."" Obviously, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a large seller of products for a number of companies, and that's no different with GoPro, as the e-commerce platform represents 12-14% of its revenue.Management apparently hopes to resume working with Amazon within a few weeks. Estimates say losing a month of sales via Amazon in October will result in a $10 million loss of revenue. I found this in a note from Charles Anderson of Dougherty & Company:Others have made the case that demand is exceeding supply for the Hero 5 camera.What I'm seeing is an event that, on the surface, looks and sounds quite bad. But underneath, it isn't quite what it's being made out to be. If Amazon cuts the price on the Hero 5 and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) follows suit, this won't be good for GoPro. However, if customers are hell-bent on getting a GoPro, whether they buy it in October, November or December, they are going to buy it. Preserving margins is a key thing for the company to do, particularly after last year's disappointing results.Also, if consumers are looking to get the device online and cannot get it from Amazon, do you know where they'll likely turn? That's right, GoPro.com.Can Sony Kickstart the Virtual Reality Market?Shares of Sony (NYSE:SNE) are hovering near 52-week highs Thursday as the company launches its PlayStation VR headset.Let's take a broader look at the VR market for a second. If you haven't tried it, it's easy to dismiss it as the next fad, but I really don't see it that way. I didn't feel it was a fad before I tried it, and I definitely don't view it as fad after.The experience is quite immersive, but some people like to harp on the negatives. The quality of the entertainment, the price, the lack of content, etc. If the chicken and the egg debated who should go first, we would have ended up with neither. What I mean by this is simple: the developers couldn't, and wouldn't, come out with content without the headsets, even though that forced headset makers to roll out expensive hardware with little content on the shelves.Given that these headsets are new to the market, of course they are expensive. Were computers cheap when they first came out? No, but look at how far they have advanced over the years. VR is the same way. It's an incredible concept that, at the moment, is weighed down by a high price and limited content.VR is not just for gaming, though. We've already seen its effectiveness in sports training, and it can be used for entertainment (like movies, city/world tours, etc.) and education. I've also seen it used in the real estate world. Imagine touring a house on Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) from the comfort of your own home. VR can do that and much more.So right now, the market has limitations. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke about VR recently, explaining that its Oculus property is attempting to make a mid-level VR set. One that doesn't sacrifice much on the specs, but is also more affordable than current models.Most high-quality VR sets cost anywhere from $500 to $800, and that doesn't include the price of the high-powered computer needed for the product.However, Sony's product comes in at ""just"" $400 and can be powered by a PlayStation 4. If you don't have a PlayStation, this will set you back an extra $400 or so, so the total cost could be around $800, plus some other necessary hardware. Not necessarily cheap, but still cheaper than many alternatives.Could it be a game changer, though? Ten years from now, it may not seem like it. And I'm not necessarily a visionary here. But I will say this much: Sony already showed it can be monstrously successful with its console, selling more than 40 million PS4s so far, roughly doubling Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox sales.All of those customers are instantly a Christmas present away from donning a VR set on their head. PlayStation also has the platform that can support a strong lineup of content and already has some ready to go upon launch. So while it's not necessarily make-or-break in the VR world this early in the game, I think Sony does have what it takes to help push VR in the right direction. With a lower pricing point and strong content, it can accelerate VR past early adopters and into the mainstream.Do I think VR will have a ""GoPro holiday season"" like the action camera maker had a few years ago? No. At least not this year. I think the technology we've seen this year is impressive and is a great starting point to build off of. But another year or two of improving content and lower prices will be what really lets this industry take off.What's Happening to Our Tech IPOs?Talend (NASDAQ:TLND), Acacia (NASDAQ:ACIA) and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) were the IPO darlings of 2016. But recently, they've been suffering. Despite Talend's 10% climb on Thursday, shares are still 30% from its highs, with Acacia and Twilio (the super darlings) off a similar amount.Is this a buying opportunity or a red flag? Most of this comes down to valuation, honestly, so the answer will depend on the investor.For me personally, I tend to miss the boat on these IPO plays, then never feel comfortable enough to buy them after they've rallied 100%, 200% or sometimes 300%. I know their businesses are great, but I just can't pull the trigger on a stock that has rallied so far. Maybe it's from watching GoPro, Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) or any number of other hot IPOs eventually cool.For instance, is Twilio really worth $4 billion (even after its pullback from nearly $6 billion) despite expectations for it to have sales of just ~$270 million this year? In other words, would you invest in a local lemonade stand with a $100,000 valuation that has sales of just $6,500? Even though that lemonade stand has great growth prospects, there's a level where it becomes unreasonable. Unless it's like the stand below:Call me old-fashioned. Or something. But even with Twilio/Talend/Acacia down 30%, and even with such good preliminary results from some of them, I just can't fork out the dough for the valuation these stocks currently demand."

In 2013, it began looking into its finances from 2010. Although Facebook has handed over some information, the social media icon has largely dodged the IRS, failing to hand over most of the requested information. Most recently, the company skipped its seventh summons in regards to the IRS.Its refusal to play ball, so to say, likely hasn't left a great taste in the IRS's mouth. As a result, it has slapped Facebook with a notice of deficiency of $3 billion to $5 billion, plus interest and penalties.Likely to no one's surprise, the company plans to challenge the notice in court.To explain why the IRS is hounding Facebook, simply put, is because the company (while using Ernst & Young as its advisor) has reportedly undervalued its property when it transferred some of its holdings to Ireland.Understandably, when the company was transferring its assets, it wanted to do so at the lowest possible value, in order to pay the lowest amount of taxes. If I had to guess, some sort of middle-ground settlement will likely emerge as a result.With sales growth of almost 60% in the most recent quarter and over $23 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet as of last quarter, Facebook likely isn't sweating too much over the potential outcome.Still, you'd have to assume a multi-billion hit for a company will likely be a turnoff for some investors, assuming that were to happen, of course.Talend Debuts for Trading, Climbs 41%Shares of France-based software vendor called Talend (NASDAQ:TLND) debuted for trading on Friday. The stock opened for trading at $27.66, vastly above the $18 per share pricing that was set on Thursday night. Closing at $25.50, shares were up more than 40% in its first day of trading.The company priced above its expected range of $15 to $17, showing investor demand was high. The extra 53% opening-price pop showed that demand clearly remains strong going into the weekend. For a good breakdown on the company's numbers, check out Don Dion's piece, here.The IPO market has not been the same as it has in recent years. It has been relatively quiet and it didn't help that markets got off to a rocky start in the beginning of the year. With the heightened volatility, a lot of young companies were scared away from the public market.It also doesn't help that unicorns - companies like Uber (NYSE:UBER), Airbnb (AIRB) and Snapchat (CHAT) - are withholding from the public markets as well, opting to raise money on their own.Perhaps persuading Talend to go through with the IPO was the major success from Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). The company priced its IPO at $15 per share, but opened at nearly $24 per share. That was the end of June. Now the stock's trading north of $40.Talend picked a good day to go public too, because…The QQQ ETF Powered Toward New 52-Week HighsThe PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) got a spark this week (and over the past few weeks) as its biggest components all moved higher following earnings.This week alone, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) completed the ""earnings sweep"" - beating on earnings per share and revenue expectations. Ten days ago, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) swept earnings as well.Arguments about valuations and lowered expectations can be made until investors are blue in the face. But the fact remains the same: the five largest companies in tech (and five of the six largest companies in the U.S.) all beat expectations and all of them moved higher as a result.That's got to bode well for stocks, right?It should for the QQQ Fund, the widely-tracked ETF for tech stocks, (although it does have some other exposure to other sectors too).The ETF is pressing new 52-week highs, and while it appears to have succeeded in setting a new 52-week closing high, the elusive new highs failed to materialize Friday. It's now just a stone's throw away.Ironically though, the one thing that's probably really stopping this ETF from being higher is one of the components that's helping boost it toward new highs: Apple.The tech giant accounts for more than 10% of the ETF and while shares are up roughly 6% this week, they are still down 21.5% from their all-time highs and 15% over the past year. At the same time, the other four stocks mentioned are at or near 52-week or all-time highs at the moment.PlayStation Shares Details Over Its VR SystemVirtual Reality has been an increasingly-talked-about technology that many are expecting to boom into a large market by the end of the decade. The IDC expects the industry to generate hardware sales of more than $2 billion this year on sales of roughly 9.6 million units. By 2020, it expects 110 million units to sell, boasting a five-year CAGR of more than 180%.Getting involved from an investing standpoint isn't as clear, but Facebook's acquisition of Oculus VR in March of 2014 for $2 billion really gave the industry a boost.While CEO Mark Zuckerberg has spoken bullishly on the industry, calling it the ""next major computing and communications platform,"" he also said it could take up to 10 years before VR is able to reach the mass market for consumers.That's not stopping a number of new companies from popping up in the VR space. Some are for real estate, others give high-level sports teams (mainly pros and college programs) the ability to train using VR and some are game makers. Notably, Sony (NYSE:SNE) is one of them.The company, which is up some 9% Friday after it surprised investors with a first-quarter profit, shed some light on its PlayStation VR, set to debut on October 13th.According to a document released by the company, users are asked to have about 60 square feet of available space; forming a rectangle roughly 10 feet long by 6 feet wide, with the user placed basically in the middle. Sony also suggests sitting for as much of the VR experience as possible. Many have pushed back, arguing that sitting does not lead to an experience that's quite as immersive, while others have cited nausea due to sitting and using VR.Some alternatives have popped up, like Virtuix Omni (some of you may remember it from Shark Tank). The private company is actually raising funds via SeedInvest, allowing non-accredited investors to get in on the action. As for product, it makes a non-motorized, omni-directional treadmill that allows VR users to move, walk and run in any direction, eliminating many of these problems.Perhaps the product and others, would be a good alternative for console-based VR games. In any regard, VR is still a very young technology, which looks primed to get off to an explosive start later this year and going toward the end of the decade. The solutions and products that await us should be quite exciting."

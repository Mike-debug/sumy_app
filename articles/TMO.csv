Thermo is likewise highly leveraged to present-day R&D efforts aimed at COVID-19 therapies and vaccines, as well as future production efforts. With the biopharma industry still ramping up its bioproduction capabilities, Thermo has plenty of growth to look forward to even once the COVID-19 tailwinds ease.You don’t go into life sciences looking for bargains; there’s the occasional hidden gem here and there, but by and large, a cheap-looking stock is cheap for a reason. That doesn’t apply to Thermo; Thermo is a top player in the field and priced accordingly. While the long-term returns suggested by discounted cash flow aren’t all that robust, the valuation isn’t so out of line for sector norms, and few companies of this size have Thermo’s growth leverage, nor its demonstrated ability to build value from M&A.COVID-19 has been creating strong tailwinds for Thermo’s business across a range of consumables, including basic lab equipment and supplies, as well as testing instruments and consumables. Revenue grew 11% in the second quarter, with 55% growth in Life Sciences Solutions, 12% growth in Specialty Diagnostics, and 5% growth in Lab Products and Services, but would have been down closer to 10% without the benefits of COVID-19-related sales.While many companies are seeing fading negative impacts from COVID-19, the benefits to Thermo aren’t fading yet. Management recently raised guidance for the third quarter, calling for 24% organic growth on a $1.6 billion COVID-19 tailwind (on a year-ago revenue base of around $6.3 billion), with the non-COVID-19 business expected to improve to flat. For the fourth quarter, management expects organic growth around 13% to 27%, with non-COVID-19 business returning to modest growth.Although rapid antigen-based tests for COVID-19 from the likes of Abbott (NYSE:ABT) are seeing swift uptake, there’s still a strong demand for PCR-based testing, and management is looking to boost its capacity from 10M/week to 20M/week in October. While PCR testing won’t be the front-line approach of choice, it is still valuable for functions like confirming positive tests, and it will likely still be used in cases where rapid turnaround isn’t needed, and there isn’t the budget (or need) to bring new systems to replace it.Thermo’s tailwind from COVID-19 is likely to last well into 2021. The company is involved in over 250 projects relating to therapeutics or vaccines targeting COVID-19. One of the strengths of Thermo is its wide breadth of instrument, consumable, and service offerings – it can supply biopharma companies from the earliest research stages (including sample collection) through R&D and into and through production. As companies ramp up to meet what is likely to be tremendous demand for an effective vaccine, Thermo still stands to benefit from significant instrument, equipment, and consumables sales.Once the COVID-19 pandemic fades away, Thermo will face some elevated comps, but it is not as if the core business is unattractive.Along with companies like Danaher (NYSE:DHR), Thermo is a leading supplier into the bioproduction market, a rapidly-growing market (low double-digit growth) that is being driven by the increasing penetration of biological products like antibodies (and, further down the road, gene therapies). Thermo is a top-three supplier in most areas where it competes, including cell culture media, single-use vessels (used in fermentation), buffers and other chemicals, and automation, and is also present in markets like chromatography (downstream purification).Thermo is likewise a strong player on the research side, with a range of instruments used in the research process, including PCR and next-gen sequencing. Thermo has definitely lost their momentum in the next-gen sequencing market, where they were once, briefly, a legitimate threat to Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), but they’re still the second-largest player in the market. Thermo is also strong across a wide range of consumables (reagents, primers, and so on) used in research processes, and between consumables and services, about three-quarters of the revenue base is recurring.Contract manufacturing is another business well worth watching. A lot of the business is built around the 2017 acquisition of Patheon, a meaningful player in the contract development and manufacturing organization (or CDMO) space, and Thermo has since added to it with acquisitions in areas like viral vectors for gene therapy (the 2019 Brammer Bio deal) and its own internal capex (expanded sterile fill-finish capacity).While large pharmaceutical companies typically want to own and control their own manufacturing capabilities, many smaller R&D-driven players simply lack the resources to build this infrastructure, particularly when they are in their earlier cash-burning days. Even for larger companies that have sufficient manufacturing capabilities for R&D efforts, it often makes sense to outsource production capacity, and this is where Thermo comes in. This business has grown from about $1 billion in 2015 to around $4 billion today, and I expect it to continue growing at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate as biotechs increasingly look to compete in biologicals and gene therapy.Whatever doubts I may have about the model (modeling is always an inexact process), I have no doubts that Thermo will remain active on the M&A front. Thermo has spent almost $40 billion on deals since 2010 (nearly 70 deals), and wanted to spend about $12.5 billion more on QIAGEN (NYSE:QGEN), but a significant number of investors there, buoyed by the company’s own COVID-19 tailwinds, thought Thermo’s offer too low.It’s not unreasonable to think that Thermo could look for other properties that would increase its leverage to molecular diagnostics (including both sample prep and actual tests). Of course, there are a lot of directions Thermo could go, and a range of companies in diagnostics, bioproduction, scientific instrumentation, and research-enabling technologies could be on the board.As is, I expect Thermo to generate long-term growth on the higher end of the mid-single-digits, growing around 150bp to 200bp above the underlying life sciences market growth rate. I do expect an ongoing mix shift towards higher-value consumables and services for the biopharma sector to drive better margins, pushing FCF margins into the 20%’s and driving low double-digit FCF growth.Valuation is always a challenge with life science companies, as they typically sport robust multiples and screen expensive on most conventional approaches. Still, many of these companies have outperformed despite those seemingly high starting points. To that end, while Thermo doesn’t look cheap by conventional means, it doesn’t look priced out of line with its peer group. I don’t see enough upside at today’s price to want to jump in, but below $400, I might feel differently."
4379031,105793,2020-10-14T11:14:50-04:00,"Thermo Fisher has enjoyed an exceptional year to date, with investors realizing 43% to the upside, on the back of strong fundamental tailwinds.The stock has bounced away from support 4 times this year, with potential new support drawn from the end of September.Valuation remains heavily dislocated from today's trading, but return on invested capital and capital employed supports the market price relative to valuation.Several catalysts are in the pipeline, and the market expects huge things from Thermo, which we will enjoy completing our deep dive into the company following Q3 earnings.","Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) continues to shine for shareholders this year, up 67.66% since April to an all-time high of $466.72 at the beginning of today's play. Significant catalysts have panned out for TMO YTD, which the company seems to be capitalizing on, alongside several other tailwinds that may yet to be priced into market value. Since our initial long-thesis on TMO back in July (found here), the company has featured several advancements that have impacted share price positively over the previous 2 months to date.Just take a look at some of the key updates on the TMO growth story over this period, credits to Seeking Alpha for the updates:August 5th:Thermo Fisher announces high-throughput testing system for coronavirusAugust 10th:Thermo Fisher develops COVID-19 blood test for transplant communityAugust 13th:Thermo Fisher walks away from Qiagen after deal deadline passesAugust 19th:Thermo Fisher introduces new assays for next-gen sequencing solutionsAugust 28th:Thermo Fisher Scientific to inaugurate VTM production siteSeptember 8th:Inovio adds Thermo Fisher to list of COVID-19 vaccine makersSeptember 15th:Thermo Fisher expands laboratory plastics productionSeptember 23rd:Humanigen inks manufacturing deal with Thermo Fisher for lenzilumabFreeline inks supply agreement with Thermo FisherData Sources for all news items: Seeking AlphaSeemingly impressive from this life sciencesgiant. What has been equally as impressive, is the upward movement on the charts which has reflected this positive market sentiment and ongoing push for growth from TMO. Since March, we've seen TMO bounce from the support line 4 times, with a potential new support line originated from September 25th. Based on the 2 most recent developments in TMO's story, one may cite the manufacturing deal with Humanigen and supply agreement with Freeline as catalysts for the uptick in price from this point. Under the Freeline agreement, dedicated production capacity for Freeline has been secured until 2027, commencing in 2021, which includes the potential commercialization of FLT180a, Freeline's hemophilia B program.Combined with the large tailwinds outlined in our previous report, it may be apparent that TMO is showing no signs of slowing, particularly as the market rushes in a flight to quality in equities, with the current shape of the US treasury yield curve lacking excitement in prospective returns. In the chart below, we see how TMO has continuously bounced from the support line YTD nicely, with new support at $416 from September 25th, as mentioned earlier. Recent migration towards the RSI 70 line may be heading to overbought territory, providing grounds for a small pullback, which would be ideal for entry if the market continues its love for TMO long-term.Data Source: TradingView and Seeking Alpha TMONew Support at 25th September:Data Source: TradingView and Seeking Alpha TMOFurthermore, the stock has just diverged from its 50-day moving average, further cementing the possibility of potential further gains. The last 2 times we've witnessed this market activity from TMO, we've seen strong uptick in prices, with an increase of 21.66% from $332.89 to $405 with the move away from 50DSMA on 15th June, to the next attachment to the 50DSMA on 8th September, which was at the $405 mark, which has resulted in a 15.802% uptick to today's trading. Further evidence of this trend has been observed prior to April, also.Below we see TMO having just moved away from 50-day moving average, the red line on the graph:Data Source: Seeking AlphaTMO has proven to be a true growth story for longer term investors, returning over 270% on an initial investment in 2015 to date. With current trajectory, the long-term outlook remains as bullish, particularly as earnings season approaches, and us analysts are chomping at the bit to update modeling and make our next moves. What's equally as impressive are consistent dividend increases over this time period. Although fwd yield is relatively small, 0.19% to be precise, combined with current stock movement, investors will continue to see upside provided the 5 year CAGR growth of 4.84% is held toward perpetuity.Data Source: Author's calculations from previous analysis.Current shareholders may want to trim the top at current trading, looking for a pullback of around 10-15%, or in the ranges of $405-$424, to reallocate and benefit from greater reallocation scale back up to today's trading. We have been rather active on this stock, trimming our position with each 2-7% pullback, and reallocating at the look of an uptick, wherever possible. As momentum heads towards breaching the RSI 70 line, we may be entering overbought territory, which may be the catalyst for this pullback. We encourage investors to keep a close eye on the RSI and corresponding stock price movements for potential entry at the figures mentioned above. With each small downtick, there is great opportunity to lower ones dollar cost average, as the price climbs north towards the ranges of $470-$480, which we are confident the stock will reach within the next 12 months.Fundamentally, the momentum is in place for TMO. We have previously discussed the strength on the balance sheet and sound debt management from the leadership, with a Moody's upgrade to Baa1 for European issued notes and strong credit analysis to support the picture. The vision for growth is clear, and the company has no meaningful debt maturities until 2025, although may consider refinancing in the current yield climate. Back in March, the company issued 4.133% fixed with the final 2020 coupon made in September. The benefit to the company was liquidity preservation to see out any unforeseen market turbulence, secondary to the pandemic, and to prevent value erosion from the same. Fortunately, huge revenues of $1billion+ have surmounted on the back of supply integration with the pandemic, which TMO has undoubtedly benefited greatly from. Therefore, TMO is well capitalized and has the cash and management vision to continue this run up, well beyond today's trading, which the market will rule extremely favorably on if Q3 earnings live up to expectations. For reference, investors may benefit from TMO's recent current position, as of June 2020, to compare to Q3 filings:Data Source: Author's tabulation from previous analysis, citing TMO 10-Q's 2019-2020TMO Leverage, 2016-2020:Data Source: Author's CalculationWhat the above shows is that the company generates enough cash from operations and return from invested capital to evidence success of the growth vision. Further acquisitions are possible, alongside expansion of current facilities, without the margin pressure that occurs with the high switching costs that other companies face when entering TMO's operating domain. Although the Qiagen deal fell through, TMO was firm on its position and reasoning, to which the market believed also. Personally, we feel the decision to abort the deal was a good one, particularly as greater acquisition and expansion opportunities exist on the horizon, including beyond the pandemic. We see this especially true, as TMO has generated exceptional ROIC and ROCE up until this point, which we look for to justify valuations and market price, alongside growth in these numbers over a 3-year period at least. Certainly, TMO has shone here, and evidences the capacity to generate superior returns over capital allocation. What's more, with magnificent FCF growth forecasted into modeling, additional return may be realized by the company, provided management's decision making remains at or above par to today's level.Data by YChartsData Source: Author's Calculation's from previous analysis.We have performed a 3 scenario analysis using a DCF valuation over implied inputs relative to TMO's price, the snapshot of which can be observed below. This model will be updated very shortly, during earnings season, with our remodeling taking place after TMO's Q3 earnings release. As usual, we are accustomed to assigning a terminal growth rate using the PRAT model of DuPont, alongside a discount rate related to the opportunity cost of the 10-year treasury yield plus the S&P 500 mean return over the 10 years to date. Furthermore, we are satisfied with TMO's trajectory, and foresee less forecasting risk with this strong company than previous, therefore have forecasted out to 2029 using our modeling. Investors should revise this valuation prior to and after earnings release, and refer to our in depth coverage that will be released after Q3. A deeper valuation analysis will be released in our Q3 modeling for TMO, which will analyze sensitivity to inputs and all 3 scenarios in greater detail, also.Base case:Data Source: Author's Calculations from modelingBlue Sky Scenario:Data Source: Author's Calculations from modelingGrey Sky Scenario:Data Source: Author's Calculations from modelingIn any of the cases, we see the stock as overvalued respective to market price. However, we will wait until earnings before assigning a price target, as we want further information on Q3 performance and management guidance to assign the correct multiple and build the updated DCF model. Valuation certainly is expensive at this point, evidenced further in FWD P/E of 29.54, FWD PEG of 2.36x, and EV/EBITDA of 28.75x. The market undoubtedly has high expectations for the stock, based on these figures. P/Sales of 7.08 and P/CF of 35 and lofty P/FCF currently at 44.31, are also in support of the high valuation. But we have said it time and time again, high ROCE and ROIC will always support the valuation, if not the dislocation between market price and valuation. It depends on what investors are after - value players will stay clear. But long-term growth players will be watering at the mouth, disregarding these hefty multiples in favor of the growth story and movements on the charts. Besides, high P/E and EV/EBITDA companies have averaged +30% this year, a domain in which TMO resides.TMO EV/EBITDA, YTD:Data Source: Seeking AlphaData by YChartsAny pullback in price of 10-15% to the levels of $405-$424 mentioned earlier in the article will certainly provide a correction in valuation, and bolster the case for immediate entry at either of those points, fitting with the picture within the base and upside cases from our analysis. In the absence of this pullback, we would keep a close eye on the movement of the price back towards the 50D SMA to make a case for immediate entry. Otherwise, we see further growth coming out of Q3, so entry at today's price is also certainly justified at this point, by our best estimation.At current valuation, there is a chance of a large correction that would reflect unfavorably on short term investors. We would be on the lookout for a slowing in momentum or breaching of the RSI 80 line to really cement this view. This would provide evidence that perhaps the market has slowed and the run up may be at a slowing or stand still period. The fundamentals and growth catalysts offset this sentiment, however there is no saying the market will feel this way. Additionally, allocation of capital towards another large player within TMO's domain in response to a vaccine or some other major breakthrough related to Covid-19, may cause a sudden drop in returns based on pure supply and market trading volume. As TMO is 90%+ institutionally owned, we view this as a risk, should a large player suddenly unload shares to take profits or trim a large position. There has also been evidence of insider selling over the last 3 months, albeit in smaller numbers, therefore some may just either be trimming a position or taking profits from exiting a lockup period. That is pure speculation, however.Any large decrease in price may be offset by the fact that shareholders have been heavily compensated for any downside risk at play YTD, as the smoothed Sortino Ratio has hovered around 10-12 for the last 6 months, which is exceptional on a price returns basis. Thus, with volatility to the downside, investors may take solstice in the fact that historically there has been adequate compensation for this exposure. We would strongly remind investors however that historical data is not a predictor of the future, however. In this light, we would encourage investors to manage risk by entering in a smaller position than usual, and perhaps consider taking profits earlier than usual, to benefit from the upside. In order to protect massive movements to the downside, one may consider an options hedging strategy, purchasing out of the money puts at a strike reflective of the last 2 months trading, with low implied volatility. Investors who foresee high volatility or high downside ahead may consider purchasing the call options without actually owning any of the underlying stock, to prevent any direct exposure to the downside, however, consider that upside may be limited with this strategy. We foresee tremendous growth for this company, so we are long the stock, with a hedging strategy in place for the longer term.Data by YChartsA fantastic year thus far for TMO has been reflected in the market sentiment, resulting in large price returns YTD. We anticipate a strong Q3 exit, and look forward to completing our deep dive analysis on TMO at this point, sometime in October/November, so investors should look forward to our report at this time period. Until then, momentum seems to be in favor of a further uptrend, evidenced by the charts and volume from the end of September to today's trading of $468 at time of writing. TMO's growth story certainly remains vivid, and management's vision for growth seems superior judging by the nice returns over capital we've observed to date. The valuation is a potential deterrent, but the tailwinds are there to support the dislocation. We anticipate a strong Q3 exit from TMO."
4373252,56142,2020-09-09T10:37:06-04:00,"A Thermo Fisher - Quest Diagnostics merger would have numerous cost synergy and sales growth possibilities.Margins/returns for the businesses are similar, and a mostly-stock transaction would be strongly accretive to Thermo.A fully-integrated testing company would quickly overtake the industry, and give pricing power to its owner.","In 2006, Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific merged to create today's leading laboratory supplier of equipment, kits, instruments, reagents, chemicals, software and consumables. Part of the company's successful growth story for decades has been the use of accretive acquisitions of similar businesses from existing cash and business income generation. In addition, this growth strategy continues today, sometimes with unexpected hiccups.Last month, Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) announced it was terminating a $12 billion purchase offer for diagnostic test maker Qiagen (QGEN). The merger deadline was Monday, August 10th, contingent on at least 66% of Qiagen shares being tendered. With only 47% of shareholders agreeing to the deal, Thermo decided to walk away, instead of increasing its offer price a second time. The good news is Thermo will receive a $95M payment from Qiagen per contract terms for its effort. Fellow Seeking Alpha author Gary Gambino wrote an interesting article on the logic for terminating the deal here.So, what kind of transaction should Thermo look for next, with $6 billion in cash on the balance sheet at the end of June, raised in preparation for the Qiagen takeover? I think the company should review the math and logic of directly entering the laboratory testing service field. In this theoretical exercise, I will attempt to demonstrate the basic thought process, merger/acquisition teams use to determine the value of a combination before making a bid.Image Source: Company WebsiteSpecifically, I propose Thermo Fisher buy out Quest Diagnostics (DGX), one of the primary clinical/lab testing companies in America. Why not fully integrate the testing process, moving from lab equipment and test kit maker, to owning the labs themselves all over the country?Image Source: Company WebsiteThe timing and inspiration for the merger idea came last week. Investors in the industry were spooked by the August 27th news of U.S. government FDA approval of the Abbott Labs (ABT) 15-minute onsite test for COVID-19 virus exposure/infection. Will coronavirus lab test volumes flatten or decline right away? Will regular swabbing and blood draws sent for lab testing even be necessary in coming months for the pandemic? While the answers depend on virus spread rates, alongside the speed of Abbott's rollout and manufacturing capabilities, the incremental pandemic bump to lab testing sales in 2020 will likely dissipate next year.The appearance and spread of the novel coronavirus in early 2020 has pumped total testing volumes from sickened individuals, and led to strong sales/income growth for both companies this year. Going into late summer, the two critical testing giants were considered legitimate beneficiaries of the pandemic situation by Wall Street. For Thermo, or another acquirer, Quest's sudden stock drop of almost 20% the last month has brought the valuation and price back to levels witnessed in 2017-19. If you were contemplating a purchase of Quest, the takeout math is definitely getting better with the lower equity quote.The primary advantage of my proposal is a fully-integrated testing solution company would become the instant lab of choice for a variety of reasons. The merged company would resemble something akin to a fully-integrated oil/gas company like Exxon (XOM) or the leading brand name in fast food, think McDonald's (MCD). It would represent the same as a major oil/gas exploration & production company, buying the gas stations to deliver the final product to consumers, and holding the production services and refining operations along the supply chain.The hookup could easily persuade hospitals and large businesses to move their testing from other national and local laboratory companies to the industry's new brand-name leader. It would provide the same brand recognition and trust factor that explains why travelers stop at McDonald's for food vs. the local restaurant across the street, missing large-scale consumer marketing and goodwill.The new enterprise would be the leading maker of lab equipment, testing kits, and materials, also directly engaging with end users to collect and handle scientific samples, transport the samples to testing facilities, and provide feedback of the results to clients and customers. A number of middlemen managers and accountants, plus duplicate company operating expenses could be slashed to lower costs to end users. And, handling the whole process in-house under a single organization umbrella would enhance the marketing message and end-user confidence in the test results. Higher volumes from each lab, an expanded network of labs over the years, and lower unit costs would open superior profitability/returns to the owner of such a combination.Thermo Fisher is already holding a stash of $6 billion in cash, borrowing much of the money for the terminated Qiagen merger. A Quest deal would be around the same takeover cost as Qiagen. A slight premium in an all-stock deal of $16 billion, or a higher premium at $18 billion with mostly stock and some cash as the offer might be a good opening bid. Using the high Thermo Fisher equity valuation as currency for an acquisition makes the most sense. And, the lower the takeover cost, the greater the accretive effect on the new company's results. No doubt the synergies and big thinking would be apparent to Wall Street analysis of a merger, with both stock quotes rising under the right circumstances and terms.Why not attempt a buyout of Laboratory Corporation of America (LH), the largest competitor in the space? LabCorp is slightly bigger than Quest, but operating with more leverage and lower margins. In my mind, Quest would make a better financial fit with Thermo Fisher's assets and management style. Plus, Quest/Thermo may have stronger odds of government antitrust approval as the #2 lab services provider.Why would Thermo want a lower margin business? The simple answer is Quest's profit margins and returns on invested capital don't look much different than Thermo Fisher. Below are 10-year graphs of the remarkably similar returns generated by both businesses, reviewing operating margins, net profit margins, return on assets and cash flow to assets.The combination would be accretive to Thermo Fisher's earnings, cash flow and revenue per share from day one. And, the downside ""risk"" of the effort is quite minimal, with Quest's equity capitalization just 10% of the existing Thermo Fisher organization. Notice on the charts below the big discount Quest is priced at vs. the equivalent valuation multiples for Thermo. Using the basic financial ratios of price to ""trailing"" sales, earnings, cash flow and book value, exchanging Thermo stock for Quest would help lower Thermo's record high valuation of August 2020. All told, adding $250-500 million in depreciation and amortization of goodwill from the deal's purchase price would also boost Thermo's free cash flow, before cost synergies and sales improvement appear at ground-level labs.Earnings growth is already projected to be well above trend vs. the S&P 500 average for both companies in 2021-23. Witnessing a meaningful drop in EPS during this year's recession, income for S&P 500 index participants is not projected by Wall Street analysts to eclipse last year's peak until 2022, if not 2023.Here is my back of the envelope arithmetic for the deal, given a slight premium, mostly-stock transaction at a $130 Quest price ($110 in Thermo stock or roughly 0.2683 TMO shares exchanged, and $20 cash per Quest share): Thermo Fisher's cash operating EPS would move from $15.05 projected for 2020 to $16.00, cash flow per share from $16.50 to $17.80 (including Quest deal amortization of $375 million annually), and revenues per share from $71.00 to $82.50. Mind you, these numbers assume all other variables remain the same. No cost-cutting synergies or a likely jump in demand for company lab testing are part of this equation. However, I would expect 2021-22 results to increase in kind, as these benefits from the merger are realized.Thermo Fisher Scientific is currently a top 10% choice in the S&P 500 for momentum trends using my Victory Formation computer sort of technical indicators. Why not use the strong stock quote as currency to acquire a complimentary business at far lower valuations?Below is a Thermo Fisher chart of the positive 12-month uptrends in the Accumulation/Distribution Line [ADL], Negative Volume Index [NVI], and On Balance Volume [OBV]. ADL measures intraday buying trends, looking at closing values each day against the high/low prints of the session. NVI counts only falling volume days vs. the previous sessions. Thermo's NVI has been quite strong the last 12 months, an indication of material buying interest on slower news days, when supply is limited. Lastly, the OBV uptrend has shown regular volume buying, a healthy and normal condition backing a robust price move.For Quest, a super-strong ADL has been offset by a much weaker NVI and a lackluster OBV trend. Given this data, I would expect a slight rise or decline in price for the equity the last 12 months, and that's a pretty accurate description of the minimal annual gain in the quote. The absence of a big price increase, while the fundamentals of the business have improved dramatically in 2020, is the underpinning of its takeover ""value"" proposition.Both stocks are interesting buy and hold selections, as the need for lab testing seems only to expand year in and year out. The economic intersection of medicine and technology is the best explanation of the scientific lab industry. Whether for immediate health reasons, employment verification, or research into disease and the human condition, why not merge two companies that work together at arm's-length, into a single enterprise working hand in hand? Thermo Fisher's regular acquisition spree to expand scale, lower costs and ultimately grow earnings should logically lead the company into the lab services delivery field.Remember, this is purely a hypothetical merger idea I developed last week. There are no rumors or news stories suggesting such a takeover is imminent.Margins and returns are not much different as separate companies, although a likely boost for the clinical/lab testing side of the new business on integration and promotion by Thermo Fisher could be theorized. An enhanced value proposition for consumers and businesses using local lab sites, combined with lower operating costs, could propel income gains for years.Thanks for reading.

4340368,105284,2020-04-27T20:23:14-04:00,"Thermo Fisher only modestly underperformed company guidance in Q1 as its products for testing and researching COVID-19 helped offset reduced demand from shutdowns.China was the key driver of these results in Q1 and provides a template for how the rest of the world will look in Q2.Thermo traded within 1.5% of its all-time high after its earnings call. Given the mix of headwinds and tailwinds from COVID, the company once again looks fairly valued.","Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) reported Q1 2020 earnings on 4/22/2020. Thermo’s earnings releases and slide deck offer less detail than many companies, so it is especially helpful to listen to the conference call for more color on the past quarter and forward guidance. This was even truer in Q1 given the positive and negative impacts of COVID-19 on results. Thermo Fisher is one of the largest providers of laboratory equipment, consumables, and services. The company produces test kits and analyzers for COVID-19 testing, a wide variety of lab instruments used in research, lower-tech consumables like pipettes and tubes, and contract lab services for eventual vaccine development and distribution. On the down side, COVID also negatively impacted demand by shutting down other lab activity to comply with quarantines and social distancing. This was seen predominantly in China in Q1 but has spread to other areas in Q2 even as China reopens many facilities.Thermo Fisher grew sales by 2% in Q1 2020 compared to Q1 2019, which was 3% below its original 2020 guidance of 5% revenue growth. (The company withdrew guidance earlier in April.) The company saw a 3% tailwind from COVID-19 related demand, offset by a 6% headwind from shutdown-related demand loss. In Q1, this was predominantly in China which was down 25% in sales. Looking ahead, Thermo now expects Q2 sales growth to be in a range of flat to down 15%. The wide range is due to the uncertainty around how long various parts of the world will be in shutdown mode.The company did not provide any sales guidance beyond Q2. Actual results will of course depend on how fast the economy and customer demand returns to a more normal level. The COVID-related demand provided a partial hedge in Q1, but is expected to be more than offset by negatives in Q2. In the second half of the year, Thermo may see additional COVID-related upside in its contract research laboratories which could help develop and distribute a potential COVID vaccine. Nevertheless, second-half demand in other areas is still uncertain. With the shares trading at $335 following the earnings release, TMO is now only about $5 or 1.5% below its all-time high around $340. At these levels, the stock is still a hold as I indicated in my last article on the company. The market provided a short-lasting opportunity to buy Thermo under $300 in late March. It would take prices at that level or an improved and more confident outlook to move Thermo to a buy.Thermo Fisher moved quickly to develop a COVID-19 diagnostic test before the end of Q1. The company can provide an end-to-end solution for testing, selling equipment for sample collection and prep, the newly developed COVID-specific test kits, the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) analyzer, control kits for quality assurance, and interpretive software. This equipment can test up to 94 samples in under 3 hours.Source: Thermo Fisher websiteThermo offers other products to aid in research of the virus and vaccine development. These include:Additional information on Thermo’s research solutions for COVID-19 can be found here.Thermo Fisher is also actively pursuing using its Patheon contract lab services to participate in packaging and distribution of an eventual COVID vaccine:Source: Thermo Fisher Q1 2020 Earnings CallThermo’s next acquisition candidate, QIAGEN (NYSE:QGEN) offers similar equipment for sample prep and testing.Thermo Fisher is well-positioned to aid in the fight against the coronavirus, although it is not the only company that can help. Others such as Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) are also providing testing solutions. The longer-term benefit to the company from ongoing research, testing, and vaccine production is also hard to quantify at this time.Thermo Fisher’s 1Q results were possibly not as bad as the market feared, but only China had significant COVID impact in the quarter. The virus did not significantly impact Thermo’s business in the rest of the world until the end of March. With more widespread impact in 2Q, Thermo anticipates COVID related tailwinds of 6%-12% in 2Q and headwinds of 10%-25%. Combining these two effects and taking the fat part of the probability curve results in the flat to -15% impact mentioned previously. Management stated the tailwinds would depend on the level of virus testing and use of Thermo’s tests vs. competitors. The headwinds will depend on how soon governments lift their shutdown orders and how fast customers ramp up activity. Thermo has not seen significant impacts on their supply chain or their own operations.On the testing front, Thermo is producing 5 million tests in April and also has the largest installed base of PCR systems to run the analysis. The company does face some challenges in training and logistics to maximize the capacity of the analyzers to run the tests.Source, CEO Marc Casper, 4Q Earnings CallOn the demand headwinds, we can look to China for how reopening activity is progressing. After shutting down activity in 1Q ahead of most of the world, the company now sees its activity in China back to 60%-70% of normal:Source, CEO Marc Casper, 4Q Earnings CallIf the rest of the world follows China’s experience, they may be only one quarter behind, and the second half of the year could be close to plan. Management did not forecast anything like this on the call, and I believe it would be too early to do so at this point. Still, if you look at that as a best-case scenario, Thermo will still deliver under the original plan due to the shortfall in the first half. Ongoing new research and vaccine production in the future would need to be considerable to make up for the lost first half business.Despite the known slowdown in the first half of the year, Thermo Fisher is trading close to its all time high before the onset of COVID-19. This seems premature, as the extra business from COVID related testing and research has not yet offset reduced activity in other areas. Once economies reopen around the world, Thermo’s incremental business from continuing virus research and vaccine development will probably not be enough to move the needle enough to justify the trailing 12-month P/E of 26.9 as of the close on 4/22.As I have pointed out in prior articles on Thermo here and here, the company has done a great job over the years growing by acquisition while keeping its balance sheet strong. Thermo has another opportunity with the QIAGEN acquisition, expected to close in 2021. Nevertheless, I considered the company fairly valued ahead of the onset of COVID-19, and my long-term view has not changed as the stock is back at similar price levels. The market provided a short-term opportunity at the end of March to buy under my previously stated target of $298. So, for now, Thermo remains a hold unless prices dip below that level or the outlook becomes clearer."

Shareholders have also enjoyed 138% in total returns over the 3-year period to date with a 5.8% downside risk on monthly returns over the same term (monthly returns utilised for the scope of medium to long-term players).Data Source: Market Data; Author's CalculationsMoreover, earnings results for Q2 2020 were recently posted on July 22 with pleasing results for shareholders, beating revenue expectations by $9.17 million and EPS by $1.00, whilst currently trading at its all-time high of $407.36 (at time of writing), registering a YoY holding period total return of 44.33% to today's date, and thus presenting an exciting entry point for those considering a longer horizon. The company has also outperformed the greater market total return by 26.1% YTD and has elicited 23.6% returns over the S&P 500 Health Care Sector over this same period.Data by YChartsThe company has delivered said returns on a background of many factors; including, but certainly not limited to:Data Source: Value Line TMO; Author's CalculationsConsequently, the company presently trades at valuation multiples either in line or below market expectations which are outlined in this report, thus bolstering our long position case and the call for entry for a medium/long-term holding period. We do not discuss an exit strategy over this term here.On further examination, we believe the company will continue to earn above-market returns, delivering equally as satisfying results to shareholders into the future and is a buy on value for the following reasons:Given the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) uncertainty heading into 2021, the citadel protecting the company has significantly broadened on the back of fulfilling global demand for COVID-19 related medical supplies, generating around $1.3 billion in sales relating to the pathogen this year to date, whilst procuring large-scale tenders under the US Government alongside the Mayo Clinic and WuXi Diagnostics.Key metrics including ROA, ROE, FCF, ROCE, profitability in gross sales and dividends are above the median for our set of 5 comparable companies, and these figures are poised for ongoing expansion over the next 5-year period at a minimum. Exact figures are discussed below.OCF margin of 76.12% and 20% operating margin for Q2 both showing YoY growth, alongside liquidity preservation measures in place. There are no foreseeable drains or pulls on liquidity.Evidencing competency in management strategy and providing clear guidance for 2020/2021.Coverage is sound from an OCF, FCF and interest payment standpoint, with short-term solvency equally as sheltered by cash and short-term assets. The company's issued bonds are payable on a semiannual basis at 4.133% and are non-floating issues.Coverage from FCF and estimated annual net income of ~$4.5 billion in 2021 with sustainable payout ratio incentivising future shareholders.Although not indicative of future returns, the market has certainly foreseen the potential in future cash flows for the company, valuing the share price at its all-time high at present on a background of the above point (at time of writing).Generating leading products and services in the Life Sciences, Tools and Services industry, particularly in response to the coronavirus pandemic.The company has beaten analyst's estimates each quarter over the last 2-year period in both revenues and EPS.Furthermore, on a comparable basis also, the company evidences the ability to generate additional revenues for the itself and its shareholders. These valuation metrics also demonstrate the expectations from the market and are favourable relative to peer companies within the industry, discussed below.To provide supplementary analysis to the investment case, we present 3 scenarios in our model. Inputs in each scenario include:In its current position, TMO is positioned to adhere to the base or upside case, especially as the company is demonstrating fundamental momentum relative to the market and comparable companies of a similar profile.In the event of forecasting risks panning out, we hold in-the-money option positions against any unfavourable price movements in the short term, to hedge against value erosion of the investment outlay.TMO generated $6.917 billion in TTM gross revenues on a margin of 45.52% from the most recent filings. This is up from the previous period, which is certainly pleasing. EBITDA and net income from this figure were $2.019 billion and $1.15 billion, respectively, with OCF of $5.272 billion available on an annual basis for continued operations, thanks in part to sales pertaining to COVID-19 medical and safety supplies. OCF margin is quite satisfactory at 76.12%, and the company shows an operating margin for Q2 of 20.1% to support expansion of products and services in reply to increased demands.Interestingly, there seems to be a moderate amount of positive correlation and causation of daily coronavirus data and price movements of TMO stock price:Data Source(s): Seeking Alpha, Our World in Data; Author's CalculationsThe correlation measured between the movement of the 2 daily figures is positive at approximately 83%; however, correlation does not mean causation. The R square figure is the coefficient of determination, illustrating that around 68.75% of the price movements in TMO's daily share price from 1st January 2020 may be attributed to changes in recorded daily coronavirus cases throughout the world. On the basis of this, moving forward, I feel this is an interesting metric to watch over, particularly noting any deviation in the coefficient of determination figure over time: if cases increase drastically worldwide, then there is a chance TMO's price returns may reflect the same based on this data. These results perhaps are on the back of the market favouring TMO as a leading provider or COVID-19 medical and safety supplies and as investors fly to quality amidst market turmoil, TMO has shone as a hot contender for the same.Data Source: Value Line; Seeking Alpha; Author's CalculationsRevenue has climbed at a CAGR of 9.6% over the 5-year period to date and shows no sign of slowing. Revenue growth of 23.6% is expected over the next 3 years, obtained using linear regression from the consensus of analyst estimates. Expansion in OCF over this period is expected by 23.7% again from linear regression of estimates, having enlarged by 63.75% over the previous 3 years to date. Further increases are more than likely, as cases of COVID-19 continue to resurge following the slow reopening of the economy, and health resources are continued to be drained from the same.Data Source: Value Line TMO; Author's GraphOn this growth, EPS has consistently beaten expectations over the previous year, most recently by $1 exactly, which was exceptionally pleasing as a demonstration of value creation for shareholders. Consequently, there have been a total of 15 up revisions for projections into the next quarter.Data Source: Seeking AlphaQuarterly EPS is expected to increase by 12.7% by Q4 in December this year on annual EPS estimates of $15.01 in the same month. This figure is tipped to increase around 10% each year over the next 3 years, using the same approximation method outlined previously.Data Source: Author's Calculations; Seeking AlphaThe company has demonstrated profitability after meeting its obligations to date with an FCF margin of 16.17% on current FCF of $4.245 billion, available to shareholders through planned dividend increases and to the company by way of additional working capital. At the current speed, FCF is anticipated to climb by over 60% to $5.564 billion by December 21 (using the same estimation method), representing a substantial increase of cash available to shareholders and expanding operations.Data Source: TMO 10-K; Quarterly Reports; Author's TabulationData Source: Author's Calculations; Obtained using linear regression from the consensus of analyst estimatesROE for the TTM was 12.65% for shareholders, well above the industry median of -50.39%. We believe this figure is an accurate reflection of profitability for shareholders, as peer companies with similar profiles to TMO have ROE ranging from -6% to 20% each with smaller market capitalization relative to TMO, and the company has delivered a higher TTM ROE than the median and mean figured from the 5 comparable companies discussed throughout this analysis:Data Source: Author's CalculationsAs seen, TMO registers higher ROE than all peer companies bar Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW) and as seen above. The figure of ~13% for TMO seems sustainable on the back of continued earnings surprises over the last 2 years, beating analyst estimates 8 out of the 8 quarters to date. For Exact Sciences Corporation (EXAS), EV/EBITDA was not recorded as it is a negative score and receives a blank score in the screening.ROE Sensitivity, Base case in blue, upside in green, downside in salmon; current figure in yellow:Data Source: Author's CalculationsWe see ROE for shareholders potentially suffering if there is a 5-6% reduction in annual net income over the next period, even on the back of conservative estimates for increase in average shareholder equity from the balance sheet. In the base case, we see shareholders benefiting by 1.5-1.87% and the company showing a sustainable FWD growth rate of 13.17%Additionally, the company has shown ROA of 6.02%, turning over 44% for every dollar invested obtained from an asset turnover ratio of 0.44. The ROA figure sits aloft the median figure in the company group and well above the industry median of -31%. On the back of reasonable asset turnover, the company has demonstrated exceptional annual ROCE of 9.28%, up from 7.2% 3 years ago. The change in ROCE is definitely reflected in the share price, valuation increase and total returns delivered to shareholders over this period. In fact, ROCE is a metric that I use to screen for quality in valuation and growth, as many companies which show consistent positive changes to ROCE also register higher valuations and capital gains over time. The mentioned figure sits above the median peer number of 2.2%, and particularly over EXAS by way of example, which has performed poorly over ROCE. However, EW outshines here. Although, at ~18% return on capital, the question arises - is this sustainable? As it may become unrealistic to expect ROCE to continue at that rate; and TMO's figure is far more realistic from a sustainability perspective to continue to deliver returns; moreover, it gives some room for scale in the absolute figure to grow. Nonetheless, investors should monitor the relative figure of EW closely, as one may find it a better use of investor capital over TMO if these trends continue.Data by YChartsPeer Comparison:Data Source: Author's CalculationsFrom its most recent payout, the company returned around $85 million in dividends, mirroring a 16% increase which the company has committed to fulfilling over 2020. TMO shareholders have realised ongoing dividend gains since 2012 with demonstrated CAGR of 4.84% in payouts over the 3-year period to date. Current yield is 0.22%, below comparables Danaher Corporation (DHR) at 0.36% and alongside Becton, Dickinson and Company's (NYSE:BDX) 1.15% yield and thus does not seem overly attractive, being in the 25th percentile over US dividend paying companies. However, considering this is relatively early days in dividend payouts for the company, long-term players will benefit from commitment to ongoing payout expansion into the future at the current entry dividend (annual) of $0.88/share forecasted for 2020. Most recently, the company fulfilled its Q2 dividend of 22 cents/share on the back of favourable earnings growth previously outlined, and the current trajectory looks to satisfy ongoing growth of payouts into the future.Data Source: Value Line TMO; Author's CalculationsOn a payout ratio of 5.86%, this is extremely sustainable in light of FCF and net income for the year, thus coverage remains well splayed from the perspective of FCF and net income at 38.5x and 13.24x coverage respectively on the current DPS figure. Payout ratio also has wiggle room for scale, thus incentivising current and future shareholders. Dividend growth is estimated at 6.8% over FY2021, with 7.5% growth forecasted the year after, to show example (obtained using regression analysis from consensus of reviewed analyst estimates). FWD coverage is therefore well matched on this DPS growth at 9x from FCF and 3.09x current net income. Total return investors should, therefore, see the upside case here, particularly on the back of the sales and growth ratios for the company previously outlined.Data Source: Value Line TMO; Author's CalculationsThe company finished the quarter in a well capitalized position having exited with cash and equivalents of $5.82 billion, expanded from around $3 billion over one year ago. From a solvency perspective, the company is well positioned and has adequate interest coverage moving into 2021. Interest payments are covered by earnings at 10.56x for the quarter and annually by 8.18x the EBIT total. Total debt is well managed by the asset base with every dollar of assets carrying ~50 cents in debt, which has been consistent over the previous 4-5 annual periods. This is pleasing to see and evidences the leaderships' competency over debt management. These figures also show investors the company's capacity to generate additional return on capital. With fewer dollars attributed to the current portion of long-term debt, after leveraging up for participating in acquisition activity, this cash can materialise as re-investable working capital alongside research and development funding.Data Source: TMO 10-K; Quarterly Reports, Author's CalculationsIn March, the company issued notes to primary claimants under the THERMO FISH.20/25 title on volume of 1,100,000,000 issues, paying a coupon of 4.133% (on regular interest) and maturing in 2025. The bond is not a floater and is due to make semiannual payments over this time period. The next coupon date is for September of this year, thus additional management over interest coupon payments is required to satisfy bondholders and other non-residual claimants and to retain adequate liquidity in the firm for operations and obligations. However, the firm is positioned to fulfil its obligations here.TMO Current Position (Annual):Data Source: TMO 10-K; Quarterly Reports; Author's TabulationExtending on the solvency basis, short-term obligations are also well covered with a current ratio of 2.62x, evidencing the company's capacity to meet its short-term commitments as they fall due. The company holds $3.648 billion in inventory as per the last report, which is not out of line from older filings, and thus, the company seems to be managing its inventory well, and performing an acid-test over short-term solvency, the company holds a quick ratio of 1.71x if unable to sell inventory quickly. This is in contrast to BDX and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (NYSE:LH) which seem to elicit a shortfall in this domain with current position of 0.98x and 1.18x, respectively. Thus, in this frame, TMO is well positioned on the back of these factors, propping the buy case as default risk and drains on liquidity seem unlikely, thus permitting shareholders to gain on the back of the company growth strategy.TMO current position (Quarterly):Data Source: TMO 10-K; Quarterly Reports; Author's TabulationData Source: Author's CalculationsTMO has many catalysts for continued growth, adding weight to our case. The Protein-Binding Assay market is poised for ongoing expansion and is projected to reach around US$425 million in 2023 on a CAGR of 10.7% over this period. TMO is a major player in this market and focuses on developing partnerships through collaboration and license agreements, ultimately strengthening their position within the market segment. TMO is successful in drug discovery, reducing development costs and growing R&D expenditure within this segment.Furthermore, in January of this year, TMO and LH entered an agreement that would permit LH to utilise TMO's patented ""Next-Generation Sequencing System (NGSS) alongside the R&D rights to their Pan-Cancer Assay technology, which is a complete solution to detect multiple targets in tumour examination and treatments.This particular platform is an exceptional innovation that delivers accurate results within the period of a single day; however, it is not for use in the general public - it is for research and development purposes only, therefore, TMO benefits greatly on the back of higher margins that can be charged to research cliental. The exciting aspect is if it gets approved for diagnostics and results are extrapolated to the general public where it can reach critical mass. That is a multi-billion dollar opportunity in itself as TMO will capture market share quickly on this platform.Additionally, TMO has been busy with acquisition and collaborative activity this year, such as in February where they announced a collaboration with NanoPin, to develop diagnostics for blood born infectious diseases. NanoPin will ride on the back of this technology to hopefully produce assays for these particular types of conditions, the aim of which is to speed diagnostic and results wait times. TMO's position here allows it to pioneer the reduction in wait times for critical results for clinicians and patients alike.As well, the company has entered into a partnership with the company Q-linea who are from Sweden. This procurement grants Q-linea exclusivity in the monetisation of the system ASTar, which is a unique system that helps deliver rapid test results for patients in critical care whom are suffering from dangerous infectious diseases, COVID-19 included. TMO benefits here from repeated sales and the licensing structure, in stability and predictability in revenues for example, especially as particular markets within the segment are growing at around 10% CAGR annually.Data Source: Hospice MedicaAdditionally, there are many coronavirus-related catalysts, which is peculiar but nothing short of fantastic for TMO. Genetic Technologies (GENE) has started its first purchases of the panel of tests that are a part of the COVID-19 test that Thermo has pioneered this year, for instance.From the company's end, they have maintained operations through a 3-pillared approach that has enabled the continuation of financial gain this year, such as including numerous health and safety protocols at its sites alongside medical personnel who are able to offer counsel and service to management. In addition, it has maintained its business to match global COVID-19 related consumption in medical and safety supplies. Consequently, the company has had minimal disruption over its supply and integration chain.The entity is also is focused on delivering on its long-term vision for growth, by capitalising on growth in existing markets and growing relationships with purveyors to add rungs into the supply chain. To demonstrate, the company has very recently released two new ""Orbitrap Exploris"" medical instruments which shall assist in the advancement a segment known as biotherapeutic research. From the company's end, these moves evidence leadership's ability to continue to grow and capitalise their existing markets whilst generating new forms of income.As mentioned, the company has continued to facilitate global demand for COVID-19 related products and, as such, ramped up its production of the diagnostic tests that will assist clinicians to diagnose coronavirus in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. This is achieved through a complex testing protocol that is able to detect nucleic acid specifically pertaining to the COVID-19 pathogen. The company is pushing for its attainment in Europe also.The company noted very recently from the end of Q2 that capacity is high enough to produce and dispense more than 10 million of these tests each week. Furthermore, in terms of the development of therapeutics and vaccines, Thermo Fisher is partnering with a number of biotechnology clients who are concurrently working towards unification in COVID-19 related products and research and is currently working on more than 200 COVID-related projects globally. As such, the pharmaceutical arm of the company is presently working towards the production of medicines that are reportedly demonstrating some effectiveness in treating the COVID-19 pathogen in humans.Moreover, as part of its vision for growth and generating effective return on capital, TMO has been busy with acquisition and collaborative activity this year. The company has recently completed a deal to acquire QIAGEN (NYSE:QGEN) which is a leader in molecular biogenics, which will be a parallel fit to the company's existing operations. This deal undoubtedly will also enhance cash value towards shareholders coming out of 2020. In fact, such is the perceived success of this acquisition, that immediately following the deal, Moody's reaffirmed the company's Baa1 senior unsecured credit ratings on the back of consistent competency in debt management having leveraged up over this period of acquisition activity.Data Source: Moody's Investor ServicePerhaps equally as satisfying is the increased coverage over emerging markets, which the company has mentioned to be a key competitive advantage that has secured a high amount of quality accounts. As TMO continues to scale their operations in existing markets, it plans to increase its visibility in large APAC nations in particular India and China, and to extrapolate these markets into other regions such as Brazil, for instance.Market participants have shown support in numbers from March until date. Subsequently, the price has rallied to its all-time highs this month of July. This show of support has bolstered the valuation and on current trends seems as if the trajectory will have legs for the remainder of FY2020.Data by YChartsThe company has been paying dividends since 2012, thus we feel it is appropriate to utilise a 2 stage dividend-discount model to support our valuation case. In TMO's case, we see high periods of super-normal growth over the next 3 years at minimum and confer with analyst that there will be a dividend increases for this period. We have arrived at a required rate of return figure of 13.5% by summing the opportunity cost of holding the S&P 500 index and the risk-free rate, using the 10-year expected (mean) return and the current 10-year treasury yield as the proxy. This figure is preferred in our opinion over the equity risk premium at this point, considering high uncertainty within equities markets at present. Growth estimates are obtained from performing linear regression of the consensus of analyst estimates and have estimated the growth rate to perpetuity using the Gordon Growth formula and arrived at a figure of 13.3% to determine a terminal value of $395.53.2-stage dividend discount model:Data Source: Author's CalculationsFrom our inputs, we see the intrinsic value as overvalued by 2-5% (on the quoted share price at time of writing) on an intrinsic value of ~$398. This figure will be watched closely over the coming weeks and months, utilising the same inputs for TMO and similar companies for comparison. Our scenarios on the DDM are outlined below, and we observe a sizable downplay in valuation to undervalued territory with a 0.10% increase in our estimated perpetual growth rate for dividends. In this view, the premium placed on the market price is supported by fundamentals and market considerations discussed earlier.Sensitivity Analysis: Intrinsic Valuation; base case in blue, downside in salmon, upside in green:Data Source: Author's CalculationsAdditionally, we have added weight to the valuation with analysis over FCFE, using FCFE estimates that are obtained using linear regression of the consensus of analyst estimates over the coming 5-year period. We have utilised the PRAT model to obtain estimates for the sustainable growth figure of 9.70%, to arrive at a fair value of $427.96. See below:On this analysis, we see the equity value as undervalued relative to the current trading price (at time of writing) thus, in unison with the DDM above, we firmly believe the stock is fairly priced in the trading ranges of $395-$430, which we feel the company shall meet within the next few months at its current trajectory. An average of the two DCF metrics gives a figure of $412.93, which is about right in our view. Additional cases are observed below, most notably a sizable increase in equity value on a 1% increase in the sustainable growth rate, illustrating where the valuation is most sensitive to changes in long-term growth of FCFE.Sensitivity: FCFE Equity Value; Base case in blue, upside case in salmon, upside case in greenData Source: Author's CalculationsThe company trades at a premium TTM P/E of 43.99x aloft the industry multiple of 36.39x; however, it is well positioned relative to the peer entities median of 61.59x. This is pleasing for TMO, as it exemplifies value on this front; as many high P/E companies within the S&P 500 (SP500) have shown 30-50% growth at high valuations this year, TMO, in this case, demonstrates equally as satisfying growth albeit at a far more respectable P/E valuation than Amazon (AMZN) at ~150x, by way of example.Furthermore, the market values the company on a P/Sales front ahead of the industry and peer median in this case, at a ratio of 6.16 vs 6.43 and 6.215, respectively. Additionally, from a price-earnings growth front, TMO shines again, although is expensive compared to the industry. This, alongside the comparable P/E figure, demonstrates the premium market participants are willing to pay on the back of demonstrated results and upcoming expectations from the company, rather than seeming out of sync with valuation. You get what you pay for, especially for equities at the moment.Data Source: Value Line; Author's CalculationsTMO therefore screams value here, albeit at a slight premium, by our best estimation, the company will continue to ride up and at these metrics and clearly outshines some of its competitors to navigate the horizon moving forward.There are risks to the company and to shareholders. In our downside case scenario, we see that if the company cannot perform at the sustainable growth rate and is to underperform by only 0.10% from our estimates, then the intrinsic value will likely show that the stock is highly overvalued by an additional 51.1%. If we are incorrect in the discount rate applied, and it were to slightly increase in combination, this would blow to over 70% overvalued. We are confident in our calculations relative to other estimates to mitigate this point. The sensitivity to dividend growth in this model demonstrates the risks shareholders face at the current share price and must be closely watched, particularly leading up to Q4 guidance. Therefore, a medium to long-term horizon is preferred to capture gains on the back of company performance, rather than valuation alone.Additionally, if our input assumptions are correct on FCFE valuation, then we see a 1% dip in sustainable FCFE growth as a 71% overvaluation on equity value. This is certainly an unfavourable impact on valuation. However, the company is poised to perform well on an FCFE basis by all estimations.Additionally, there has been around 3-5% downside risk in price returns over the 1-3 year period. Maximum drawdown on price from May of this year has settled around 25%, which has been pleasing on the back of the price rally that has occurred over the previous few months, but above-average returns may bring volatility and expand on this previous drawdown.For the company, sales have taken an impact particularly on surgical/medical supplies, as the majority of elective surgeries and procedures have been cancelled amidst the pandemic. There is no saying when these will resume, and thus, uncertainty in these accounts has arisen for TMO. Furthermore, the company's industrial end markets recorded a ~10% decrease, whilst their accounts were negatively affected on a growth front by 20% decrease in customer sales. Customers in these two end markets were significantly affected by business disruptions due to the pandemic. As the company also participates in several global markets, it faces foreign exchange risks associated with its global accounts, thus shifting the carryon costs of hedging positions designed to dampen these effects. Hedging costs may increase too on the back of the weakening US dollar and uncertainty with key state relationships, such as China.The case for a buy on value and growth has been made clear in this piece. Potential shareholders will benefit at the current entry price, although high, considering the company's directive out of 2020 into the post-pandemic society. We feel the company is well positioned to adhere to the at least the base case in our scenario, and even if we are wrong in two out of the three scenarios, the company is still poised to perform on other additional fronts, separate from intrinsic value. On the analysis of comparables, TMO outperforms the median figures of the industry in enough of the metrics to bolster the valuation and the case for entry. Long TMO for 2021."
4369103,105284,2020-08-17T05:06:10-04:00,"Thermo Fisher showed discipline by walking away from the Qiagen merger rather than overpaying.With no near-term debt maturities, Thermo should consider a special dividend or doubling the regular dividend.Thermo is a great company but I would not add at these levels and don't want to see the company buying back shares either.","Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) announced this week that it was terminating the agreement to acquire Qiagen (QGEN), a Netherlands-based company with a business similar to Thermo's Life Sciences Solutions segment. This was triggered because only 47% of Qiagen's shares were tendered at the €43.00 cash offer price, below the 66.67% required. Thermo raised their offer once in July from the initial offer of €39.00 and 75% required for approval announced in March.At €43.00, or about $50.87, Qiagen would have been valued at $11.6 billion or 26 times the analyst consensus for 2020 earnings of $1.96. That is not much less than Thermo's current multiple of 27.6 times 2020 earnings estimate of $15.02. Thermo's anticipated EPS growth from 2020 to 2021 is 10.4% vs. 7.1% for Qiagen.Source: Seeking Alpha QGEN Earnings Revisions PageSource: Seeking Alpha TMO Earnings Revisions PageThermo Fisher has a good track record of acquiring and integrating companies, particularly in Life Sciences and Contract Development and Manufacturing. Even though they added debt over the years to make these deals, net debt/EBITDA stayed constant while EPS grew at 16.7% per year on average since 2012. I discussed this in more detail in my October 2019 article, ""Thermo Fisher Scientific: Moving From Inorganic To Organic Growth.""While Thermo announced the Qiagen deal after this article, they also came upon a source of organic growth in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic. Neither I nor the company expected such a significant contribution during the first few months of the pandemic as I discussed in my April article, ""Thermo Fisher Scientific: Ammo For The COVID-19 War."" However, when the company announced 2Q results, they had 11% sales growth. As discussed in the conference call, Thermo saw $1.3 billion of COVID-19-related tailwinds representing 21% overall sales growth. This was largely driven by testing-related kits and instruments. Offsetting this was about 10% sales declines in other businesses as COVID-19 caused closures and delays in research programs at other customers.Looking ahead, Thermo expects 18% sales growth from COVID-19 as testing demand continues to be strong. Other business is expected to improve sequentially but still be flat to down 5% compared to 3Q 2019. The company has still not built in much gain from vaccine contract manufacturing for 3Q, but the CEO believes it can make a significant contribution over the next couple of years:Source: CEO Marc Casper, Thermo Fisher 2Q 2020 Earnings CallIt's unfortunate for humanity that the pandemic became more widespread than originally anticipated in early 2020, but Thermo is in a position to make an important contribution in testing and vaccine production. With this added organic growth, Thermo is less in need of an acquisition at this time and they were prudent to not overpay for Qiagen.Thermo began issuing debt in March to raise cash in preparation for the Qiagen deal. They unfortunately picked the worst week in a decade to raise money in the capital markets. The offering closed on March 25th, the same week that the stock market bottomed and even credit spreads started to blow out before the Fed announced they would be buying corporate bonds as part of their liquidity program.Thermo offered $1.1 billion each of 4.133% bonds due 2025 and 4.497% bonds due 2030. They apparently got less than par for these bonds as you can see the effective interest rates on these bonds were 4.32% and 5.31% at the end of 2Q. The 2025 notes are 55 basis points higher than the nearest maturity US dollar notes, and the 2030 notes yield 257 basis points more than another issue maturing only 6 months earlier.Source: Thermo Fisher 2Q 2020 Earnings Reconciliation and Financial PackageOn the other hand, Thermo has issued over half their debt in euros at considerably lower interest rates than US dollar notes of similar maturity. This does expose the company to exchange rate risk, however. If the US dollar weakens before maturity, Thermo will have to convert more US dollars to pay off these notes. Without Qiagen, Thermo may have less euro-based revenues coming in as a natural hedge and may want to hedge the forex risk on the futures markets.Thermo Fisher ended 2Q with $5.8 billion in cash, compared to about $2.4 billion before the initial Qiagen offer. They had $673 million worth of euro-denominated debt due on August 7, which they do not appear to have rolled over. Thermo is due another $95 million from Qiagen for the breakup fee. That should leave Thermo with about $2.8 billion of extra cash on the balance sheet. If any incremental capex is needed to support COVID-19 testing or vaccine contract manufacturing, that would seem to be the best use at this time. If that is not needed, debt redemption might be nice, but there is none due for another two years, most issues are only callable within a few months of maturity, and they are trading well above par on the open market.With the shares trading at high valuations in the upper 20s forward P/E, I still have the opinion that I did back in October 2019 that the company should avoid buybacks. $2.8 billion of cash would cover a special dividend of about $7.05 per share. Alternatively, they could double the quarterly dividend to $0.44 from $0.22, and it would take 8 years to pay out the incremental $2.7 billion. The current dividend is arguably low, as 1H 2020 dividends paid of $163 million is only 10% of free cash flow of $1.62 billion. Thermo did return another $1.5 billion to shareholders via buybacks but stopped at the beginning of the pandemic. A doubling of the dividend to $0.44 per quarter would consume about $700 million per year and still leave Thermo with $2.5 billion per year it could use for buybacks or future acquisitions when they are economic.Thermo Fisher prudently walked away from the Qiagen deal rather than raise their offer price more than once and pay a higher multiple than Thermo's own stock. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic gave Thermo an opportunity to grow organically. If Thermo thought Qiagen was not worth buying at that price, then share buybacks at a similar multiple would not appear to be the best use of Thermo's cash.With COVID-19 testing and vaccine manufacturing possibly ongoing for a couple of years, now is a good time for Thermo to reconsider its dividend policy. The excess cash not used in the merger could fund a special dividend of $7. Even if they do not go that route, Thermo could afford to double the dividend and still generate $2.5 billion per year for buybacks or acquisitions.I've kept a Neutral rating on Thermo although I realize I should have been more bullish on the company's prospects for fighting COVID-19. That said, I'm not going to chase the stock after it has gained around 20% since the last analysis. I still remain long the stock but with no plans to add."
4361725,53552,2020-07-29T07:42:11-04:00,"TMO shares have rallied 40% to a new all-time high but are expensive at 23x 2021 earnings.Q2 results were strong as COVID-19 revenue offset revenue losses elsewhere in the business.TMO has been a long-term grower, and continued gains in pharma R&D spending will support further growth.Shares reflect this growth, and investors should wait until $350 to buy.","Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) have had a tremendous run over the past twelve months with shares up over 40% to a new all-time high. TMO is essentially the scientist for scientists, providing critical testing, devices, and services for healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. Given increased investment in biotechnology, TMO has enjoyed a secular upswing, which is likely to continue for several years, and its COVID-19 testing business has helped to insulate its business further. However, at current levels, all of this good news is more than fully priced in, and investors should take profits.(Source: Seeking Alpha)In the company’s second quarter, Thermo Fisher (financial data available here) earned $3.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which was $1 ahead of consensus on in-line revenue of $6.92 billion. Q2 organic revenue growth was 11%. Operating income was up 26%, pointing to significant operating leverage. Indeed, operating margins expanded 350bp to 27%.This revenue growth is particularly impressive considering that most companies in the healthcare sector are facing declining revenue. Pfizer (PFE) saw revenue fall 11% while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) saw revenue fall 10.8%. With governments imposing lockdowns and bans on elective surgeries, we face the surprising reality that a global pandemic has temporarily caused a drop in healthcare spending. Indeed in Q1, healthcare spending fell by nearly $100 billion sequentially, and we may see a further decline in Q2 when GDP is released.(Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve)That is because while restrictions impacted TMO’s core business, it has a COVID-19 hedge, namely that it manufactures tests. Indeed in the second quarter, its COVID-19 products generated revenue of $1.3 billion, or 21% of total revenue as testing ramped up. This result implies the rest of Thermo’s business was down 10%, more in keeping with its healthcare peers.Thermo’s main business units - Life Science Solutions, Analytical Instruments, and Specialty Diagnostics - provide instruments, software, reagents, and products needed to operate laboratories and develop medicines. COVID-19 has led the FDA to slow approval for other drugs as it focuses on vaccines and therapeutics for the coronavirus. As such, it is unsurprising demand for these products would falter. This has been offset by the fact Thermo’s fourth unit, Specialty Diagnostics, develops tests and diagnostic kits. TMO of course has a COVID-19 test on the market.Between providing lab support for COVID-19 trials and making COVID-19 tests, this ancillary revenue is mitigating losses from the rest of the business, leaving the company well-hedged for a continued pandemic. And as the healthcare system operates more normally and COVID-19 fades, TMO’s “typical” businesses will reverse their revenue losses. Indeed, TMO expects that trend to start. In Q3, TMO expects organic revenue of 15%, including an 18% bump from COVID-19, meaning regular business will be down 0-5%, a sequential improvement from Q2’s 10% drop. As such, after a strong Q2, strong results should continue through year-end.From 2010 to 2019, TMO has grown EPS at a 16% pace per year, making the company among the most impressive long-term compounders. With Q2 EPS up 28%, 2020 will continue this trend of double-digit earnings growth. Thermo Fisher has been a prime beneficiary of rising pharma R&D spending, which has grown at a 3.6% per annum pace during the decade. Thermo Fisher has grown substantially more quickly than overall spending as pharma R&D grows more technologically complex. Owning TMO is essentially a bet on continued growth in biotech without betting on any specific drug to get approved.Critically, pharmaceutical spending is expected to continue to grow north of 3% per annum through 2024. As a consequence, Thermo’s business should continue to thrive for several years. This past quarter showed the underlying strength of its franchise, and as the world becomes more normal, and pharma R&D returns to trend, non-COVID growth will resume.(Source: Statista)Fundamentally, there is nothing to dislike about TMO. It is a winner in a winning industry. Unfortunately, all of this is in the stock. I expect earnings to grow double-digits to about $17.5 per share next year. That leaves shares trading 23.3x per earnings. With $3.5 billion in free cash flow capacity, the stock is trading with just a 2.25% free cash flow. That is a really lofty multiple. There is also no reason to own the stock for income as its dividend yield is a paltry 0.22%.Given long-term growth prospects, TMO is not a stock to actively short. Rather, investors should wait for a pullback to get into a great growth company at a more reasonable valuation. I would be more comfortable buying shares 20x 2021 EPS or about $350. 20x is still a hefty valuation, but TMO’s strong performance and positive outlook are worthy of a premium multiple. But at over $400, several years of growth are already priced in, and investors should await a pullback."
4361178,50662,2020-07-28T10:00:00-04:00,"Thermo Fisher's share price has increased by more than 60% since the March lows.Despite a good free cash flow result in H1, the valuation is perhaps getting a bit ahead of itself.Trading at a current free cash flow yield of around 3%, I am not chasing the stock here but am hoping for a strong pullback.","Since my previous article on Thermo Fisher (TMO) in February, the company’s share price was only mildly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, and I never had the chance to initiate a long position at bargain prices. At this point, the company is already trading again at about 65% above its March lows, and I wanted to check if this share price surge is sustainable from a fundamental perspective.Data by YChartsLooking at the recently published financial results, Thermo Fisher had a very strong second quarter as its revenue increased by 10% while the adjusted EPS was boosted to almost $4/share (the adjustment is predominantly related to the amortization of the acquisition-related intangible assets). The strong revenue increase was predominantly caused by a $1.3B revenue boost related to COVID-19. While that’s great, this also means the non-COVID related revenue was also hit, in line with the expectations.During the second quarter, the revenue indeed did increase to $6.92B, but as you can see in the image below, the operating margin decreased from 23.7% to 20.1%. That sounds problematic, but this is actually entirely caused by a small restructuring expense of $12M compared to a $484M gain recorded in Q2 last year. Excluding that one-time gain in 2019, the operating margin would have been just over 16%. So although the quarterly income statement of Thermo doesn’t look too fantastic compared to Q2 2019, keep in mind the non-recurring items had a huge impact in 2019.Source: financial statementsLooking at the EPS in the first semester ($4.91/share reported, $6.83/share on an adjusted basis), Thermo Fisher appears to be a little bit ahead of itself considering it is trading at in excess of 25 times its annualized adjusted net income at the current levels.That being said, I realize there are some substantial non-cash items mentioned in the income statement, and the free cash flow result should be substantially higher than the reported net income and perhaps also higher than the adjusted net income.Source: financial statementsThermo Fisher’s cash flow statement shows an operating cash flow of $2.23B and after adjusting this result for changes in the working capital position, it’s clear the company’s H1 adjusted operating cash flow was substantially better than in H1 2019. TMO generated $2.975B in operating cash flow in H1 2020 compared to just $2.31B in H1 2019 and last year’s acquisitions will have contributed to this stronger cash flow result.The capex did increase slightly to $522M, which means Thermo Fisher generated $2.45B in free cash flow in H1 2020. As there have been no additional share repurchases since Q1 (wherein TMO spent $1.5B on share buybacks), we can reasonably expect the current share count to remain around 395-400 million shares (the upcoming SEC filing next week should contain the exact share count at this moment). This means TMO generated approximately $6/share in free cash flow in H1 2020.As Thermo Fisher tapped the bond market to boost its cash position to make sure it can ride out the COVID-19 pandemic, the cash position as of the end of June reached $5.8B while the debt increased from $17.1B to $20.6B, resulting in a net debt of just around $15.5B.Data by YChartsBack in February I wasn’t overly impressed with Thermo Fisher, and it looked like I would have to pay up for quality. At first, Thermo Fisher’s share price performance seemed to be correlated to the outbreak of COVID-19, and the share price moved south. The downward move (just around 20%) wasn’t nearly as strong as the violent reaction of the general markets, and Thermo Fisher never really reached a bargain price point.In hindsight, I should have known better and just have pulled the trigger on the way down by adding in tranches, but I missed out on the opportunity. Now, at just over $400/share, Thermo fisher is trading at a free cash flow yield of around 3% and I certainly will not chase the stock here. I will obviously keep an eye on potential pullbacks – as Thermo Fisher clearly is a quality name I would like to add to my portfolio down the road – but I can be patient."

Source: TradingViewBetween 2017 and 2018 Thermo grew revenues by 16% (from $21bn to $24.4bn) and net profits by 32% (from $2.2bn to $2.9bn). Comparatively speaking, then, it's understandable that Thermo's share price took a 9% hit (dropping to $311) when management announced modest Q4 and full year 2019 revenue growth of 5% and 4.9% respectively.Whilst the share price has staged a quick recovery - returning to $337 at the time of writing this post, my view is that the initial mini-correction was justified. Based on the company's financial forecasts, business strategy and growth within its target markets as a whole, I believe Thermo stock is somewhat overvalued at present and that a longer-term price correction is imminent.As I will discuss in the rest of this article I believe that the growth targets Thermo management have set themselves are not only unlikely to be realised, but, even if they are achieved, do not justify a share price valuation above $300. My take is that the fair value of Thermo shares is much closer to the $251 the company itself paid when completing a $1.5bn, 6m share buyback programme last year.Thermo share buybacks and price paid per share 2016 - 2019. Source: Thermo GAAP reconciliation and financial package Q4 and FY19.Thanks to its history of strong growth, triple-digit-billion market cap, large addressable market (estimated by the company to be in excess of $160bn) and attractive PE and forward PE ratios, I believe that Thermo will always trade at a premium to its fair value price.My expectation however is that Q120 results will disappoint the market and create sustained downward pressure on the stock price which will likely trigger a correction below the psychologically important $300 mark.At a time when growth in its target markets has plateaued, Thermo is facing a struggle to extract the necessary value from its $30bn + worth of acquisitions, and to achieve the cost savings required to increase margins in the face of challenging market conditions.As such, this could be a good time to be short Thermo stock.Thermo's management has set itself the goal of growing earnings per share in 2020 by 10% to between $13.49 - $13.67 on an adjusted basis. But the company has also forecast another year of modest growth - expecting FY20 revenues to be in the region of $26.81bn - up 4.9% compared to the $25.54bn reported for 2019 (Source: Thermo Q419 earnings call).On an adjusted basis (the main difference between Thermo's GAAP and non GAAP results being the exclusion of expenses related to amortisation of acquisition-related definite-lived intangible assets - ~$1,713 in 2019, equal to EPS adjustment of ~$3.2), Thermo's operating margin was an impressively high 23.4%. Thermo's most comparable sector rival Danaher (DHR) (market cap of $114bn vs Thermo's $133bn) reported an operating margin of 18.3% for 2019 (Source: Danaher Q419 Results presentation). In 2020, Thermo management says that they expect to grow operating margin by 30 basis points to 23.7%.To get to where it wants to be EPS-wise, however, Thermo will have to increase its operating margin much higher than 30bps in 2020 - to at least 24.25% by my calculation - given its flat growth prospects. Were it not for a forecast reduction in interest income expense of $110m to ~$340m, the margin required would be higher still - in the region of 25%.According to a presentation given to analysts in May of 2019, Thermo expects to grow its organic revenue by 5-7% over a 3-5 year period, and achieve EPS of $17.4 - $18.6 by 2022.Thermo projected EPS growth. Source; Thermo analyst presentation May 2019Based on my analysis EPS of $18 by 2022 when revenue growth is expected to be between 5-7% is only achievable if the company can increase its operating margin to >28.5% by 2022 - which to my mind is an unrealistic target.The below chart shows that typically, operating margins for S&P 500 companies focused on provision of healthcare equipment tend towards 15%.S&P 500 Operating margins: Healthcare. Source: Yardeni ResearchThe clear exception here is the biotechnology sector which typically delivers operating margins above 30%. Although Thermo has a strong exposure to the biotechnology industry via its Life Sciences division (which has an operating margin of nearly 35%) this segment of the business delivers less than 30% of the company's total revenues - $7.4bn in 2019.Thermo's 4 major business divisions: revenues and operating margins. Source: Thermo analyst presentation May 2019The remaining 3 divisions - Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Services - delivered respectively $5.8bn, $3.9bn and $10.9bn of revenues in 2019, at operating margins of 26%, 24%, and just 14%.Although Thermo's Life Sciences segment grew by ~9.5% between 2018 and 2019, it is hard to see how the division can increase its contribution to overall revenues and take share away from the low margin laboratory business at a fast enough rate to help Thermo achieve its target EPS of $18 by 2022, or even the (non-GAAP) figure of $13.6 management hope to achieve by end of 2020.Furthermore, much of the company's revenues are derived from recurring product sales - the ""razor blade"" model - consumables (52%) and services (25%) make up more than 75% of Thermo's revenues. Although the costs of switching to a different supplier are high, customers are unlikely to react well to sudden or unexpected price hikes, meaning Thermo will have to make the necessary cost savings internally as opposed to looking to drive higher sales margins externally.Thermo revenue split by type. Source: Q319 10Q submissionTo achieve the necessary uplift in margins Thermo will need to focus on achieving cost savings by leveraging its dominant market position as a manufacturer at scale and a ""one-stop-shop"" for its clients who benefit from the wide range of products the company sells.For the past decade Thermo has pursued an aggressive acquisition-led growth strategy in order to cement its status as the go-to supplier of choice for the scientific research, life sciences, pharma and biotech industries. Now the company must address concerns over whether it has paid over-the-odds for the acquisitions it has made, and whether it can successfully integrate them into a business model that provides value for shareholders.Thermo recent acquisitions and price paid. Source: my table based on data from Thermo annual reports / WikipediaThe company has spent over $30bn on acquisitions since 2010 in pursuit of the following benefits:Thermo has successfully achieved many of these goals, however the rapid pace of its acquisitions has also presented the company with several issues to overcome.At present, Thermo has on its balance sheet $13bn of definite lived acquisition-related intangible assets, $1.25bn of indefinite lived intangibles assets and $25.7bn of goodwill (Source: Thermo 10Q submission Q419) - a startlingly high figure which represents 72% of all Thermo's listed assets at the end of 2019.The high valuation of these intangible assets is justifiable provided the related acquisitions made are delivering the internal cash flows and growth momentum expected of them. In 2018, for example, when Thermo's revenues grew by 16% and its net profits by 32%, the justification for the goodwill / intangible valuations was clear. Now that revenues are growing at just 5% per annum, however, the company is at risk of incurring impairment charges which will be reflected on the income statement and reduce net profits.Thermo lists such an eventuality as a significant risk in its Q419 10Q submission.Thermo risk factor statement: source: Thermo 10Q Submission Q419As we can see from this breakdown of goodwill distribution (Source: Thermo 10K 2019) across business sectors, $5bn of goodwill is allocated to the analytical instruments division, which grew less than 1% between 2018 and 2019, and $3.7bn to the Speciality Diagnostics division, which recorded a loss of 0.16% over the same period. A persuasive case for a goodwill / intangible impairment charge could be made for either division, and if it were to occur in 2020, an impairment charge would reduce still further the chances of Thermo hitting its operating margin or EPS targets.Thermo goodwill by business division. Source: Thermo 10K submission 2019As I mentioned earlier, Thermo adds the amortisation charges relating to its $13bn of definite-lived assets back into its non-GAAP adjusted financial statements. Below is the company's rationale for doing so taken from its reporting of Q419 results.Source: Thermo Q419 earnings release.Whilst this measure may seem reasonable to most investors, it adds another element of risk to the company's already optimistic financial forecasting, in my view.In the table below I present both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings and forecasts which are closely in line with Thermo's own reporting and forecasts. Where necessary I have adjusted e.g. cost of goods sold as % of revenues in order to get to the EPS figures targeted by Thermo management in their earnings call and analyst presentation (e.g. GAAP EPS of $9.2 for FY19 vs non-GAAP $12.4, projected non-GAAP EPS of $13.6 in 2020 and $18 in 2022 vs GAAP $10 and $13.3 respectively).Thermo financial results and projections. Source: my table and calculations based on company estimates and projections.Of course, my projections will not exactly match the company's but given the amount of data Thermo has made public it is possible to make some assumptions.For example, based on GAAP accounting principles, Thermo has almost zero chance of achieving EPS of $18 by 2022 unless it drastically increases its margins. But more importantly we can see how much total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues would have to decrease by (from 77% to 72%) on a non-GAAP basis in order for the company to achieve its desired EPS.It's up to the investor to make up their mind as to how realistic Thermo's targets are, but to my mind, even in a near perfect growth scenario the company has set its expectations too high.When we factor in the risk associated with stagnant growth in 2 out of 4 divisions, the low operating margin of the company's biggest revenue generating division, and the possibility of impairment charges triggered by acquisitions that have proved hard to integrate, it seems to me that missed targets followed by a share price correction is the most likely outcome.Using the financial forecasts above I have been able to calculate a fair value price for Thermo based on a best and a worst case scenario.I calculate the firm's weighted average cost of capital to be ~10.9%. The company has a significant debt pile of $17.1bn however it is well managed in the form of commercial paper (paying low interest rates) that falls due at convenient intervals. Thermo's retained earnings figure of $21bn contributes to shareholders equity of $26bn, giving a debt to equity ratio of 11.7% / 88.3% in favour of equity (when debt + equity is divided by market cap).The weighted average of interest on Thermo's commercial paper is 3.2%, and for the beta I am using the levered 1 year beta of 1.23 (Source: Infront Analytics) and for the risk free rate the 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 1.6% at time of writing (Source: Gurufocus). Finally, for the expected market return, I am using a figure of 10% - a modest target when considering the 28% return of the S&P 500 in 2019, or the 15% return of SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF - a directly comparable index.I estimate Thermo's free cash flow to be roughly $6.1bn in 2020 (up from $4.0bn in 2019) and $9.2bn in 2025, based on revenues growing at a CAGR of 6% and total operating expenses growing at approximately half this rate (3%). I forecast pretax income growing to $12.2bn by 2025 and use Thermo's 2019 reported tax rate of 10.5% for all 6 periods.This gives me a firm value of $102bn and a fair value share price of $256. All figures used are the higher adjusted non-GAAP figures. This best case scenario calculation (where all growth and margin targets are met or exceeded) indicates that Thermo stock ($337.78 at time of publication) is currently trading at a 32% premium to my suggested fair value price. This scenario does not include, for example, any impairment charges, failure to meet cost-saving objectives or drop in revenue growth below 5-7%. Some investors may feel the expected market return of 10% to be too high. Whilst it's true that a revised figure of 8% would give a fair value of $368 I would stress that this is an optimistic scenario that seems unachievable in light of the 29% operating margin it demands in the absence of unexpectedly high revenue growth.For a comparable worst-case scenario, we can use the GAAP figures in place of non-GAAP. In this scenario, free cash flow is $5.3bn in 2020 rising to $6.3bn in 2025. All else being equal, the present day firm value of $73bn gives a fair value price of $183.Since 2016 Thermo has completed $4bn of share buybacks. This has benefited the company as well as shareholders by making its PE ratio more attractive to investors. Based on non-GAAP financial reporting the PE has declined from 34x in 2017, to 26x at YE19, and the forward PE looks attractive at 18x in 2022 and 12x by 2025 (by my estimation if the company meets its stated financial targets).Thermo recently announced a new $2.5bn programme replacing the current one which had $0.5bn left available. At the current share price, that would amount to 7.8m shares and makes the forward PE more attractive still (17.4x and 11.5x). If the company's share price does drop as I predict I will, this could prove beneficial to the company as it could buy back a greater volume of shares.As previously mentioned Thermo has $17bn of debt but it is manageable with around $700m falling due each year. The company had $5bn of cash on the balance sheet at year end 2019 and a free cash flow of $4.1bn.Thermo pays a miserly dividend of $0.19 per quarter. Given the amount of cash it has available, investors may feel that the dividend ought to be increased to compensate for a likely fall in share price. Alternatively, the company may look to make further acquisitions.It is notable, however, that during the Q4 earnings call, CEO Marc Casper outlined the three pillars of the company's growth strategy going forward. These were high impact innovation, leveraging scale in high growth and emerging markets, and customer value proposition.In other words, the company appears to be moving away from an acquisition-led strategy in favour of managing the assets that it already has. Casper has suggested that Thermo makes 1 acquisition for every 10 companies it considers as a potential target. Recent rumours that Thermo would make a bid for sector rival Qiagen (Source: MedTechDive) ultimately came to nothing.When a company's top-line growth starts to plateau, as Thermo's has done, scrutiny of the company's growth strategy and management of its assets tends to increase. Thermo's management appear to have set themselves the goal of increasing operating margins in order to fuel growth that will satisfy its investors and maintain its share price on an upward trajectory.By my calculations however, and given Thermo is already a high-margin business, this strategy seems unrealistic. The company's big money acquisitions have not delivered the growth the company would have hoped for, raising the possibility of impairment charges which would further reduce net profits. Based on a DCF analysis the fair value price of Thermo is at a significant discount to current market price. Whilst this issue can be overlooked when growth is rampant, in leaner times it makes sense for a company to trade closer to its present net value.Whilst over the longer term I believe the prospects for Thermo remain positive, I believe that whilst the company's underlying markets are experiencing slower growth, the company's prospects of replacing revenue growth with internal cost synergies are slim.As such, I believe that the company can no longer sustain a share price in excess of $300 and therefore a correction is imminent. Even at a (justifiable) premium to fair value, a price target of between $290-$300 post Q120 earnings (still a 16% premium to fair value price) is the most realistic outcome, in my view."

Academic, Government and Industrial divisions, on the other hand, are predicted to report a flat performance. Revenue growth is projected at 5% and EPS at about $13.55 (a 10% growth). Both the stock price and dividend distribution have been chugging along nicely for a long time.Image Source: Macro TrendsThough TMO appears fully priced at $340 as of Feb. 17, 2020, it has plenty to look forward to in 2020 and beyond. I am bullish on it for the long term and here’s my analysis.On Jan. 14, 2020, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH) and TMO entered into a deal that allows LH to adopt TMO’s Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) System and Pan-Cancer Assay for oncology R&D.TMO’s platform is a fully integrated NGS platform that delivers results within one day and is currently used only for research purposes. If it gets approval for diagnostic use, LH will make the platform available to its laboratories and customers, along with hospitals. It can prove to be a money-spinner for TMO.On Feb. 14, 2020, TMO announced a collaboration with NanoPin to “further develop and advance blood-based infectious disease detection by developing liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based workflows.”NanoPin’s diagnostic platform will now use TMO’s LC-MS technology to develop sensitive clinical assays for infectious diseases. This will help healthcare providers get quicker results, determine the stage of infection, and thereby make timely clinical decisions. Both collaborators believe that current methods do not facilitate timely diagnosis and evaluation of patient response to treatment.Image Source: Markets & MarketsThe infectious diseases diagnostics market is estimated to touch $19.35 billion in 2022, growing at a CAGR of 5.6%. TMO is a key player and this collaboration will benefit it enormously.On the same day, Feb. 14, 2020, TMO announced another deal – a partnership with Q-Linea of Sweden. The deal grants global exclusive rights (ex-Sweden) to TMO for commercializing ASTar.ASTar is a unique system that analyzes AST (aspartate aminotransferase) fully and rapidly. It can help doctors deliver timely critical care to patients suffering from severe infectious diseases. The Sepsis diagnostics market is growing at a CAGR of 9.1% and this partnership will help Q-Linea target global markets. TMO’s benefits from this deal include increasing sales, competitiveness, and brand image.All these three deals would act as growth drivers for TMO.TMO follows the PPI Business System of operational discipline since 2012. The system has strengthened and evolved into a culture. It empowers employees and coaches them on how to become more productive. The productivity savings help reduce waste and increase efficiencies, leading to higher profit margins. For 2019, The PPI Business System resulted in higher productivity and solid volume leverage in 2019. It will continue to strengthen TMO’s margins in 2020, and beyond.TMO faces competition from Danaher Corporation (DHR), Illumina (ILMN), Envista Holdings Corporation (NVST), Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX), and Agilent Technologies (A).Image Source: Seeking AlphaIt is apparent that investors have high expectations from the company and that is why its market capitalization ($151.37B) towers over its peers.Its stock price has gained 112.66% in the last 3 years, and 163.57% in the last 5 years – and that’s way above what any of its peers have delivered. History shows that holding on to TMO for the long term pays very well.Image Source: Seeking AlphaTMO is a global player and its profitability depends on both local and international factors. Here’s a roundabout:1. Though genomic sequencing benefits the healthcare industry and society, patient data is vulnerable to misuse. Despite operators keeping the machines offline, a group of hackers demonstrated in 2019 that it was possible to steal and reverse-engineer the genetic code by recording machine sounds. Thermo Fisher, which owns Applied Biosystems, was asked to comment but it did not. So, while hacking DNA sequencers is a tough job, the risk remains. Impacted companies may face lawsuits, and therefore this is a risk factor.2. TNO faces liability risks for which it may not have adequate insurance coverage. For example, it can be made a party in a liability lawsuit that alleges that its pharmaceutical products resulted in an injury or caused an unsafe condition. Another example: any malfunctioning of its products can result in a clinical misrepresentation and that could lead to product liability claims.3. Virus outbreaks (examples: Ebola/Covid-19) can impact the company’s operations in certain countries.4. To keep pace with the competition, TMO must develop new products that incorporate the latest technology. It also should respond to innovations or price cuts by competitors. These require significant investment and so far, TMO has performed admirably.5. TMO’s customers include pharmaceutical companies, large labs, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public/private research institutions. Some of these customers depend on government funding. Any adverse economic development can significantly reduce spending and impact TMO’s sales.Also, the reliance on large customers can hurt the company’s sales even if one of its customers faces disruption or is otherwise negatively impacted.Sure enough, TMO is an expensive stock, but that’s because it is a performer that has delivered solid gains to its shareholders while managing risks very efficiently.The company operates on three pillars – strategy & innovation, leveraging its scale in growth and emerging markets, and customer value proposition. And it has been delivering consistently on all parameters.In 2020, the company estimates the net capital expenditure to be about $1 billion, free cash flow at $4.5 billion, and shares repurchases at $1.5 billion. In particular, TMO expects the gene therapy business to grow at 25% annually without any fear of a slowdown.Marc Casper, TMO’s CEO, remarked at the end of its Q4 2019 earnings call, “But we're much more excited about what the opportunities that sit ahead of us. And we look forward to updating you over the course of 2020.”The action has just begun. Going by the company’s past track record of delivering on its promises, I am reasonably certain that there will be plenty more to come in 2020–21 and the company will indeed witness very exciting times. TMO is a high-quality stock and I am very bullish on it for the long term.*Like this article? Don't forget to hit the ""Follow"" button above!"
4322949,105284,2020-02-10T19:06:10-05:00,"China is Thermo Fisher’s largest market outside the US, comprising over 10% of the company’s revenue.Sales growth in China was already slowing in 2019, before any impact from the coronavirus.Thermo Fisher's 2020 growth forecast is back-end loaded, also before factoring in coronavirus impact.Thermo Fisher is in the fairly-valued range at 24 times non-GAAP 2020 earnings. I would wait to buy more shares as 1Q 2020 earnings could disappoint.","Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) is one of the largest providers of laboratory equipment, consumables, and services. I provided a more general overview of the company and its capital allocation strategy in my October 2019 article, ""Thermo Fisher Scientific: Moving From Inorganic To Organic Growth"". The company is growing sales at about 5% organically, and no major M&A deals have been announced since then.Thermo Fisher operates internationally, with about half its sales in the United States, 10% in China, and 40% in the rest of the world. Last quarter, I reviewed how Thermo sees China as a key source of growth. This growth slowed considerably in the fourth quarter, however. After 13% year-on-year growth in 3Q, China sales were up only low single digits in 4Q, below the company average. This slowdown occurred before the coronavirus outbreak, and Thermo attributed it to a cutback in capital spending across government-owned enterprises. For 2020, Thermo forecasted low double-digit growth but has not yet factored in coronavirus impact to their guidance.In addition to the China issues, Thermo faces tough comparisons to an excellent 1Q 2019. The fiscal calendar also will have one less day in Q1 despite the leap year. (4Q 2020 will have two additional days.) The company also sees operating margins lower in Q1 but improving the rest of the year. As a result, Thermo expects to earn only 21% of its EPS for 2020 in the first quarter, compared to 30% in the fourth quarter. Q2 and Q3 will be closer to 25%.Thermo Fisher is still a well-run company in a growth industry despite these short-term headwinds. With 5% sales growth, the company still expects to earn $13.49-$13.67 per share (non-GAAP) in 2020, which would be EPS growth of 9-11%. At a current price of $326.21, the P/E of 24 is fairly valued relative to peers and its own recent history. Despite the run-up since my last article, I still consider Thermo Fisher to be a long-term hold. I would not currently buy more as I expect the market to be disappointed with 1Q results due to tough comps and China headwinds. I would look for a pullback below the $300 area before considering adding shares.Thermo Fisher earns about half its revenue in the US, but China has been its largest and fastest growing market. China grew around 20% per year from 2016 to 2018 and comprises about 10% of total company sales:Data source: 2018 Thermo Fisher 10-KGrowth slowed considerably in 2019. On the 4Q earnings call, management commented that China sales grew only low single digits in the fourth quarter, for a full-year average growth rate of 13%. This slowdown came before the coronavirus outbreak. Thermo attributed the slowdown to government spending cuts.Source: CEO Marc Casper, 4Q Earnings CallLooking ahead, Thermo continues to guide to low double-digit growth in China for 2020, although 1Q may still be slow.Source: CEO Marc Casper, 4Q Earnings CallA Barron's article this past weekend noted similar uncertainty at Thermo's largest peers Agilent (NYSE:A) and Danaher (NYSE:DHR). As a key driver of growth for Thermo, China still has a lot of uncertainty around the 2020 forecast, especially considering coronavirus impacts have not been factored into the guidance yet.Thermo Fisher has some other issues that will impact 1Q results. First, the 2020 fiscal calendar (see last page of slide deck) has one less day in 1Q and 2 more days in 4Q compared to 2019. The company also sees lower margins in 1Q compared to the rest of the year:Source, CFO Stephen Williamson, 4Q Earnings CallThese phasing issues, along with the Chinese demand uncertainty caused by coronavirus, could cause Thermo to disappoint the market in Q1. Also, Thermo will have to count on organic growth at least to start 2020 with no M&A deals announced yet. In 4Q 2019, Thermo reportedly was in talks with molecular sample and assay technology company Qiagen (QGEN), but the company ultimately opted to remain independent. With these headwinds, Thermo expects to deliver 5% organic revenue growth, similar to 2019. Operating margin is expected to recover after 1Q, so that it will be up 30 basis points for the year to 23.7%. Thermo refinanced some of their debt in 2019 to very low interest rate Euro denominated bonds. This will save them $110 million of interest expense in 2020. Tax rate is also expected to be about 50 basis points lower this year.These impacts, along with planned share buybacks, result in the company guiding to 9-11% EPS growth in 2020, or $13.49-$13.67 per share. This growth would be in line with the growth the company delivered in 2019.Thermo Fisher generated $4.1 billion of free cash flow in 2019. They bought back $1.5 billion of stock, paid $300 million in dividends, made net acquisitions of $700 million, and paid down $1.4 billion of debt. Thermo Fisher expects to generate $4.5 billion of free cash flow in 2020. The current capital return plan is for $1.5 billion in share buybacks and $350 million in dividends. That would leave $2.65 billion available for acquisitions, additional buybacks, or debt reduction. As I stated last quarter, I would still like to see a larger dividend increase but that does not appear to be a priority for the company. Thermo ended 2019 with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.3x, the lowest in several years. They also refinanced nearly $5 billion of their debt into long-term Euro-denominated notes at rates between 0.4 and 2.0%. As such, I do not see debt reduction to be a huge priority either at this point. Therefore, I would expect Thermo to increase its buyback if no M&A opportunities arise.Below, I show an updated table comparing Thermo Fisher with 3 peers. I will note that, since last quarter, the forward growth rate shown has slowed for all 4 companies, and the P/E has come up. As a result, all 4 are now above the PEG ratio of 2 that I typically use as a buy limit. On a relative basis, Thermo valued similar to Agilent and cheaper than Danaher or Mettler-Toledo (NYSE:MTD). Looking at profitability ratios, Thermo still has the second lowest return on equity, assets, and total capital. I do not consider Thermo Fisher cheap at current prices.Data Source: Seeking Alpha Peers Comparison PageLooking at historical trailing GAAP P/E, Thermo has averaged around 30 since the beginning of its strong growth phase in 2014. Since the start of 2018, it has traded higher, in the range of 30-40 with an average around 35. With growth prospects a little more subdued, a trailing GAAP P/E of 32.5 in the low end of the recent range would be more appropriate.Source: Seeking Alpha Value PageThermo Fisher is delivering decent organic revenue growth of 5% annually. While the company expects to continue this in 2020, they will be challenged by the slowdown in China that began at the end of 2019 and could worsen with the coronavirus outbreak. The risk of disappointing earnings is highest in Q1. With improvement in the back half of the year, along with cost controls and good balance sheet management, Thermo can achieve its target of around 10% EPS growth in 2020. Thermo should also have excess cash available for M&A or to supplement buybacks above the current target. Still, with a forward non-GAAP P/E of 24, the stock is priced for perfection and will be vulnerable to any misses this year. Thermo is also not cheap compared to its peers.I continue to hold Thermo in my portfolio but would not add more shares at these levels. I would not buy more unless I saw the PEG ratio (based on forward non-GAAP) drop below 2 or the trailing GAAP P/E below 32.5. Both of these imply a price around $298."
4274165,25120,2019-07-09T19:57:39-04:00,"Thermo Fisher continues to see a steady operating performance.A fair valuation has over time built up into a premium valuation at nearly 25 times earnings.While I recognise the quality of exposure to growing end-markets and savvy dealmaking, shares trade at too rich a multiple to actively chase.","Thermo Fisher (TMO) continues to be a great long-term value compounder, driven by a very well-balanced combination of organic growth and M&A. Upon request of readers, I am looking at the shares again, as the latest write-up has been two years ago already. At the time, I looked at the shares following the purchase of Patheon in a +$7 billion deal.Ever since, shares have nearly doubled, as the advancement in the share price has considerably outrun the improvement in the operational performance, so much so that the current premium valuation prevents me from being attracted to the shares at these levels.Savvy positioning, both in an organic and inorganic manner, has transformed Thermo Fisher into a $25 billion scientific platform which is active across four large business segments. The largest segment is the laboratory products and service business, making up nearly 40% of sales, although this is the segment with the lowest margins across the portfolio. This is complemented by Life Science Solutions and Analytical Instruments, each making up more than 20% of sales, complemented by the smaller Specialty Diagnostics segment. These three smaller units are considerably more profitable, however.Note that a huge portion of the revenue base is recurring, with half of sales generated from so-called consumables, with services responsible for nearly a quarter of revenues as well. While the company has a huge presence in North America, being responsible for half of sales, Thermo Fisher has a large presence in both Europe and Asia as well, both making up nearly a quarter of sales.Each of these segments has healthy growth prospects on the back of favourable demographic trends (ageing of population causing more chronic diseases, as well as rising wealth levels across the globe). Other trends include scientific advances, technology migration and a focus on healthcare. This great positioning is the reason why the company upped the long-term organic growth target by a point to 5-7% per annum, creating very strong tailwinds for the business, of course.With revenues now totalling $25 billion, it is very clear that the merger between Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific, which took place in 2006 with pro forma revenues of $10 billion, has laid the foundation for the great value-enhancing strategy ever since.Following the deal with Patheon, I was slightly concerned about a 4.2 times leverage ratio, although solid organic growth meant that this was never a real worry. I outlined a road map in which earnings per share could hit $10 in 2018, with shares trading around $170 at the time of the deal with Patheon. Recognising the reasonable earnings multiples, even if based on adjusted earnings multiples, I concluded to become a buyer at around $150, but fortunately, we have not seen those levels again.I noted that I really liked the underlying business, a great management team and the company's good long-term prospects, yet was not a big fan of its high leverage, usage of adjusted earnings and very low tax rates. Unfortunately, I should have been a bit more aggressive, as shares have very steadily continued to rise and have doubled again to $300 currently. The search for stability, a long-term growth play and very low interest rates have fueled the rise of the shares.In January, Thermo Fisher reported its 2018 results, with revenues up 16% to $24.36 billion, as half of the reported growth was driven by organic growth. Adjusted earnings rose by 17% to $11.12 per share, far above my initial expectations of $10 (outlined in early 2017), with GAAP earnings totalling $7.24 per share. Pretty much all of the discrepancy between both metrics stems from amortisation charges, which I am happy to adjust for, hence I am happy to use adjusted earnings numbers.Total net debt of nearly $17 billion is significant, yet with $5.6 billion in adjusted operating profits and depreciation pegged at roughly half a billion, leverage ratios are very reasonable at 2.8 times. With 405 million shares outstanding currently valued at $300 per share, for a $121 billion valuation, the enterprise valuation of $138 billion works out to about 5.5 times sales reported for 2018.Quite a few developments have taken place since the start of the year as the company announced the sale of its anatomical pathology business alongside the release of the annual results in January in a $1.14 billion deal. The sale of the $350 million business is expected to dilute earnings by $0.10 per share, or about $40 million in actual dollar terms, as multiple looks largely fair. That money was quickly put to work as Thermo Fisher announced the purchase of Brammer Bio in March in a $1.7 billion deal. With the deal, the company acquired important expertise in viral vector manufacturing for gene and cell therapies. While the $250 million revenue contribution suggests a near-7 times sales multiple has been paid, growth does come in at 25% and thereby adds about 0.25% to pro forma organic revenue growth, while being accretive to the tune of $0.10 per share per annum.These deals and the termination of Roper's (ROP) Gatan deal are really just bolt-on deals, as the focus remains simply on laser-focused execution and continuation of organic growth - and that is what investors like while leverage gradually comes down enough to keep pursuing deals. The first-quarter organic growth rate of 7% was pretty encouraging, as the company raised its full-year earnings guidance to $12.00-12.20 per share, implying that at $300 per share, multiples have expanded a great deal to 24-25 times earnings.That being said, a leverage ratio in the mid-2s allows for some more aggressive stance with regard to dealmaking. Deals might be a better deployment of capital than share repurchases at current levels, with the company buying back shares at a rate of $3 billion per annum, or about $7.50 per share. This marks quite a steep payout, especially as the company pays out a dividend as well, albeit a nominal amount.In hindsight, shares offered great value in early 2017, trading at a market multiple, although leverage was high, as were organic growth rates and expectations. Fast forwarding in time, earnings multiples have expanded from 17 to 24 times, and while the achievements continue to be good and leverage has come down a bit, the valuation multiples have risen a bit too much for me.Given the continued solid expectations, performance and reduction in leverage, as well as general valuation multiple inflation, I am happy to buy shares at 18-20 times earnings, which basically works out to a $220-240 range, still far below the current valuation. That being said, shares traded actually below this range by Christmas of 2018, when the general market experienced a big sell-off. For now, I remain to be very patient, and while I believe the true long-term value of Thermo Fisher remains to be created, the current risk-reward is not attractive enough to initiate even a long-term position."
4322836,50662,2020-02-10T12:32:37-05:00,"Thermo Fisher Scientific had a satisfying 2019 and spent $1.5B on stock buybacks, reducing the share count to less than 400M.For 2020, expect a net income (and FCF) increase of around 10%.This doesn't make TMO cheap, but keep an eye out to pick up stock on a pullback.","Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) is one of the world's largest producers of scientific and laboratory equipment. Lab equipment accounts for almost 2/3rd of its total revenue, while scientific and diagnostics equipment account for the remainder of the revenue. With a decent breakdown of 75% revenue generated through equipment sales and 25% through services, Thermo Fisher has a certain recurring revenue as its customers also rely on the company for after-sales services.Data by YChartsDespite relatively strong moat (Thermo Fisher is one of the ""go to"" names in the sector), this ""boring"" company doesn't get a lot of attention here on Seeking Alpha as in the past six months only two articles were published. Now it has released its full-year 2019 results and provided a guidance for 2020, let's see if the company is still attractively priced after a 30% share price increase in the past 12 months.During FY 2019, Thermo Fisher generated a total revenue of $25.5B, a 5% increase compared to the $24.4B in FY 2018. What's interesting is that despite a restructuring cost of $413M, TMO's operating margin increased from 15.5% to 18% as the total amount of operating expenses increased by less than 2%. Big news indeed, and with a pre-tax income of $4.07B (up from $3.26B) and a net income of $3.7B (thanks to its low average tax rate) or $9.24/share, the company clearly had a good year as the EPS increased sharply from $7.31 in FY 2018.Source: Company press releaseThe EPS was also helped by the lower amount of shares outstanding (the weighted average share count dropped by 0.5% to 400M shares), and the share count will be even lower than that now. The company had 401M shares outstanding as of the end of September, but subsequently spent an additional $750M in share repurchases (according to the cash flow statement), which should be sufficient to reduce the net share count by at least an additional 2M shares given the average share price of around $300/share during the quarter. According to the company's presentation, the remaining buyback authorization is roughly $2.5B, which would allow TMO to repurchase another 7-8M shares.Source: Company presentationTalking about that cash flow statement, it is always interesting to see the conversion rate of net income into free cash flow.Thermo Fisher reported an operating cash flow of $4.97B, which includes a $619M investment in the working capital position, so on an adjusted basis, the operating cash flow was a solid $5.6B. The capex level in FY 2019 was just $926M, which is substantially lower than the $2.28B in depreciation and amortization expenses. The explanation for this discrepancy is quite simple: the high D&A is caused by TMO's relatively aggressive amortization of previous acquisitions. This reduces the operating (and taxable) income, but as this is a non-cash expense, it has no impact on the cash flow result of the company.This means the adjusted free cash flow result came in at approximately $4.65B or around $11.5/share (based on my anticipated share count after completing the Q4 buyback). This gives the company a free cash flow yield of approximately 3.5%.Surprisingly, Thermo Fisher didn't want to put its guidance for 2020 in writing, and its press release referred to the conference call where the management would provide its 2020 guidance.The company expects to generate $26.6-27B in revenue for an additional year of 5% top-line growth, which should translate into an adjusted EPS of $13.49-$13.67, an increase of almost 10% (the adjusted EPS - which excludes the amortization expenses - in FY 2019 was $12.35, or approximately a third higher than the reported EPS).But how will the company spend its cash?In FY 2019, Thermo Fisher spent $1.8B on acquisitions and an additional $1.8B in shareholder rewards (through share buybacks and dividends), so the company was clearly wasn't overspending based on its free cash flow result. As 2019 was an action-packed year, I'm not expecting much on the M&A front from Thermo Fisher this year. Perhaps some smaller bolt-on acquisitions would still be possible (for instance smaller companies that are starting to market a complementary or competing product, like Canada's Nanalysis (no US ticker symbol, NSCI in Canada) which developed a smaller benchtop spectrometer that seems to work quite well and is EBITDA positive), but I wouldn't expect Thermo Fisher to go all out on yet another large acquisition.TMO has refinanced quite a bit of its debt and will save $80M per year on interest expenses (expected impact on the free cash flow: around $60M or 15 cents per share), but considering the relatively sizeable gross debt on the balance sheet ($17.7B), it might make sense for the company to slowly walk down this amount of debt if it cannot find any suitable acquisitions. Sure, debt is cheap these days, but with a net debt of around $15B and a debt ratio north of 2.3, it wouldn't hurt the company to reduce this.Thermo Fisher is expensive; I think we can all agree on that. With an EV/EBITDA ratio of in excess of 20, a P/E ratio north of 30 and a free cash flow yield of just 3.5%, there's no way Thermo Fisher could be described as a ""bargain"". But the company does have a decent moat and expects to grow its adjusted EPS by around 10% this year, which means we can reasonably expect the free cash flow to increase by a similar percentage.This means that by the end of this year, the higher free cash flow in combination with the lower share count, the $5-5.1B in free cash flow divided over 395M shares (including the dilutive effect of the exercise of stock options) would result in a FCF/share of $12.75/share for a FCF yield of around 4%. Again, this doesn't make Thermo Fisher cheap, but it does mean it's a company that deserves a spot on the watch list. Any pullback could make the company an attractive addition to a portfolio.It could also be interesting to write a put-option on Thermo Fisher as the P300 expiring in September for instance has an option premium of $7 (for a 2.3% return in about 7 months) and should the share price expire below $300, you are essentially buying the stock at a 4.4% FCF yield."

This, combined with high-single digit revenue growth, has led to annual free cash flow streams that exceed $4 billion (over the trailing 12-month period). We would like to see a higher cash rate of return on invested capital (CROCI), but this can take a hit when a company utilizes heavy M&A (and the metric has clearly trended upward since bottoming four years ago).The last area that we look at before moving on is the balance sheet. When a company makes numerous acquisitions, it can be easy for management to lean too heavily on the balance sheet and accrue debt. Too much debt can lead to liquidity troubles and take away from a company's ability to return cash to shareholders.(Source: YCharts)Thermo Fisher has not been afraid of swinging for the fences over the years with mega-blockbuster acquisitions of Life Technologies ($13.6 billion) completed in 2014 and Patheon ($7.2 billion) completed in 2017. This in addition to many smaller deals over the years. While the company's leverage ratio currently sits above our ""warning sign"" threshold of 2.5X EBITDA, the leverage ratio is quickly declining. Barring any future deals in the Patheon size range, the financial situation at Thermo Fisher is quickly stabilizing.Thermo Fisher is a little different than the typical companies we cover. We usually focus on dividend growth stocks - and while Thermo Fisher pays a dividend, it really isn't the reason you would want to own the stock. The company's current dividend totals $0.76 per share but yields just 0.25%.(Source: YCharts)Without a meaningful growth streak to speak of and a cash flow payout ratio of just 6%, the dividend seems like a bit of a ""token"" offering by Thermo Fisher. The same goes for stock buybacks, where enough is spent to cancel out dilution from equity offerings (such as the company's $2.2 billion offering to raise capital to help fund the Life Technologies deal), but not much else.(Source: YCharts)The reason for Thermo Fisher holding back on these expenditures is simply because the cash is needed elsewhere. The company's heavy M&A strategy requires cash streams to keep the balance sheet from becoming too debt-laden. In addition, Thermo Fisher spends a ton of money on research & development, approximately 4% of annual revenue.(Source: YCharts)Given the value creation from consistent, strong revenue/earnings growth, investors are probably fine with this course of action. Buybacks really haven't been needed, and the dividend pales in comparison to the capital gains achieved over time.When investors are looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific and see its track record, the next logical question becomes, ""Can this growth be sustained""? Due to a few drivers, we are bullish on continued growth at the company.(Source: Thermo Fisher Scientific Analyst Presentation)First and most obvious, Thermo Fisher will continue to seek out strategic M&A opportunities. Management has projected that total available capital between next year and 2022 will be approximately $29 billion. Currently, about 65% is projected to be spent on M&A (about $20 billion). We expect that the company will focus on expanding its higher-margin business segments. Currently, its largest segment (Lab Products and Services) is also its least profitable, with an operating margin of just 12.5%. While Thermo Fisher is a huge player in its industries, there are hundreds of smaller players that offer plenty of M&A potential.(Source: Thermo Fisher Scientific Analyst Presentation)We also like the company's growth runway in emerging markets. Half of its revenues stem from North America, resulting in a nice growth runway in regions such as China, Europe, the Pacific, and MEA (Middle East - Africa).(Source: Thermo Fisher Scientific Analyst Presentation)Growth has been exceptionally strong in China, where Thermo Fisher generates half of its revenues classified as coming from ""high-growth or emerging markets"". The country's population density and emerging middle class present problems that Thermo Fisher is equipped to help solve, including air pollution, food safety, and healthcare.Thermo Fisher's growth record over the past decade is impressive, but there are risks present to the company's trajectory moving forward. Its strong ties with China could be impacted if tensions between the US and China continue to escalate over tariffs and other trade practices. Furthermore, the company relies heavily on the innovation of the healthcare industry. Disruptive regulations by governing bodies could also have the potential to disrupt business at Thermo Fisher if research spending is cut or pulled back. Ultimately though, we feel that the growth trajectory is quite stable.Thermo Fisher stock is currently trading near its highs at $300 per share. This means that the stock has appreciated roughly 50% from its 52-week lows set last summer. Despite this, the stock's current earnings multiple is surprisingly reasonable. Analyst consensus is projecting full-year EPS of $12.11, which places the stock at a P/E ratio of 24.77X. Despite the market trading at all-time highs, the stock still trades at a discount to its 10-year median P/E ratio of 26.56X.Unfortunately, we get a different result when we look at valuation from a free cash flow perspective. The company's current yield of just 3.51% is near its lowest point over the past 10 years, indicating that the stock is overbought based on the cash streams it is producing.(Source: YCharts)It may be unwise to expect a very low P/E ratio for a stock growing earnings at double digits, but such a low FCF yield is difficult to overlook. Thermo Fisher stock likely sits somewhere in the range of modest overvaluation. If the market were to correct and bring shares down about 15%, the resulting share price of $255 would result in an attractive multiple of 21X - a great long-term entry point for investors.Thermo Fisher Scientific offers a great assortment of traits that make it an intriguing company to invest in. An industrial stock with highly sophisticated solutions creates value in the market place and gives the company the ability to grow as it solves current/future problems within society. The company continues to expand its margins and generate increasing amounts of cash flow. Management's ability to turn those into strategic acquisitions gives Thermo Fisher a nice growth runway in the years ahead.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4298392,104812,2019-10-23T19:46:52-04:00,TMO reported Q3 earnings which beat expectations and showed a continuation of firming profitability with a positive outlook.Company is building momentum from a number of acquisitions in recent years while growing its market position with recent product launches.Expected EPS growth above 10% for each of the next 2 years highlights upside for the stock that still has value as it grows into its valuation.,"Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) with a market cap of $119 billion and generating over $25 billion in sales over the past year is a leader in scientific instrumentation, laboratory equipment, diagnostics tools, and pharmaceutical components. The company has benefited from strong growth in the life sciences and healthcare industry over the past decade with a market-leading innovative range of products. The story has been steady growth along with firming profitability resulting in the stock up nearly 100% over the past three years. The company just released its latest quarterly earnings, again demonstrating solid results, building momentum from recent acquisitions. This article recaps the company's financial position along with our view on where the stock is headed next.(Source: FinViz.com)TMO reported its fiscal Q3 earnings on October 23rd with non-GAAP EPS of $2.94 which beat expectations of $2.89. GAAP EPS of $1.88 misses by $0.02. The discrepancy here was in part based on amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, considering its completed purchase of the active pharmaceutical ingredient 'API' manufacturing facility from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) which was completed this past quarter. Revenue of $6.27 billion represented an increase of 5.9% year over year and was ahead of consensus estimates by $80 million. The gross margin in the quarter at 46% was slightly lower than the 46.3% last year, although this was balanced by lower SG&A and R&D expenses in the quarter as a percentage of revenue. Through the first nine months of the year, the operation margin has increased more favorably to 18% from 14.8% over the period last year, as one of the key trends.(TMO Q3 Financials. source: Company IR)In terms of segment results, the Life Sciences Solutions revenue led growth up 13% to $1.7 billion, now representing 27.1% of total revenues from 25.4% in Q3 2018. Analytic instruments had a more muted growth at just 2%. Laboratory Product and Services remain the largest revenue segment at 41.8%, but we note that the business has the lowest operating margin among the reported segment units at 11.6%. A favorable trend has been the strong performance of Life Sciences Solutions, which is also the most profitable for the company with a 34.5% operating margin, expanding from 32.9% last year.During Q3, along with closing its deal with GlaxoSmithKline, TMO opened new facilities in the U.S. and China. Management highlighted new product launches in the quarter where it sees adding to the company's market position and global capabilities. From the press release:In terms of the balance sheet, the company ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents while long-term debt declined by $1.3 billion to $16.4 billion. The liquidity position remains strong represented by a current ratio at 1.8x. During the quarter, the company generated $900 million in free cash flow. This year, TMO has repurchased $750 million in company stock but did not conduct any buybacks during Q3.The other highlight in the report was management's update to full year guidance, in which it narrowed the revenue and earnings range while increasing the top end slightly. The company sees revenue growth between 4% and 5% and EPS growth between 10% and 11% for the full year 2019 compared to last year.The market expects an impressive growth outlook for TMO in the coming years with a view that earnings per share accelerates to $12.26 for the current fiscal year, which is at the top end of management's guidance. Consensus EPS estimates for 2020 and 2021 are for an 11% increase for each of the next two years. Indeed, recent growth investments and R&D spending are seen paying off as the company consolidates its market position.Data by YChartsThe company highlights a number of growth drivers and sees its addressable market at $160 billion growing between 3% and 5% annually suggesting a large white space particularly in emerging markets. Growth drivers include favorable demographics considering an aging population, along with a move in scientific advances requiring more technologically advanced scientific equipment the company provides. Currently, North America represents 50% of revenues, but the company is under-penetrated across the Asia-Pacific region and Europe where it sees more growth opportunities.(Source: Company IR)Certainly, the growth story here is not a secret resulting in shares of TMO commanding an ever-higher premium. One concern comes down to valuation which based on multiples analysis shows the company is relatively expensive to its historical averages. In some ways, the higher premium is justified, given the operational and financial trends, and we believe the company can grow into these multiples in the year ahead based on current expectations.Including the most recent Q3 results, TMO is trading at a price to earnings multiple of 34x, which is above the 5-year average closer to 31x. Other measures like a price to sales multiple of 4.8x and price to free cash flow at 29x shows the stock has an otherwise rich valuation. We think TMO has value here, given the expectation for strong earnings growth and improving balance sheet position. Higher profitability and margins justify the higher premium, in our opinion.TMO valuation multiplesConsidering next year's '2020' consensus EPS estimate at $13.65, the 1-year forward P/E ratio at 21.75x is more reasonable. Presuming TMO reaches that EPS level next year, the shares would appear cheap. Ongoing progress at reducing balance sheet leverage and higher free cash flow going forward make the stock a compelling pick in the segment. We rate TMO as a buy and think it could trade at ~25x 2020 EPS representing a year ahead price target of $340 or 13% upside.TMO reported another solid quarter of steady growth with firming profitability pushing shares to approach its all-time high. We think there is still value even with the post earnings spike as the company builds momentum from recent product launches and captures its international growth opportunity. Risks going forward beyond a global cyclical slowdown include pricing pressures from competition that could limit margin expansion and the ability of management to execute on growth initiatives."

The firm has produced stellar results year over year, both yearly revenue growth and profit margin averaged roughly 10.75% since 2011. With approximately 39% of total capital financed by long-term debt, the firm has a strong capital structure. The firm's largest revenue segment is Laboratory products and services, followed by Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, and Specialty Diagnostics. For the full year of 2019, the firm expects revenue between $24.88 billion and $25.28 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of $12 to $12.20 per share. Given the firm's leading position in the industry, I believe it is highly possible for the firm to achieve its guided range. However, the firm currently looks fully valued which leads me towards recommending a hold on the stock.In 2018, Thermo Fisher invested $1 billion in R&D and launched a range of new products which strengthened its position, including the Thermo Scientific Vanquish Duo UHPLC system, Thermo Scientific Q Exactive UHMR mass spectrometer, Ion GeneStudio S5 Series next-generation sequencing systems, and the Phadia 200 allergy and autoimmune instrument in Europe. The firm gained traction in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets along with another strong quarter in China where it recently launched its first Bioprocess Design Center to support the development of biologics. The firm has reduced $2 billion in debt last year, closing $540 million of bolt-on acquisitions and returning capital through $500 million of stock buybacks and $275 million of dividends.Thermo continues to strengthen its Thermo Scientific brand by building on leading platforms across chromatography, mass spectrometry, and electron microscopy. The top 15 innovations last year that were recognized by the readers of Analytical Scientist Magazine, five of them came from Thermo Fisher. TMO's Orbitrap IDX Tribrid and the Q Exactive UHMR mass spectrometer systems at ASMS are seeing strong adoption from customers. The G4 scanning electron microscope launched earlier in the year is gaining momentum with its Materials Science customers while the Glacios Cryo-EM for life sciences which it began shipping in 2018 is ramping up nicely and receiving positive feedback from customers.Orbitrap Fusion™ Tribrid™ Mass SpectrometerIn its life solutions segment, the firm is strengthening its Ion Torrent line of Next-Gen sequences with the GeneStudio S5 series of benchtop instruments launched in 2018. Recently, Thermo has launched two important instruments under its specialty diagnostics segment, the Kryptor Gold automated immunoassay system and the Phadia 200 benchtop analyzer which helps doctor diagnose allergy and autoimmune conditions.In its latest fiscal year, Thermo Fisher was able to increase its revenue by 16% to $24.36 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 16% to $5.62 billion, with an adjusted operating margin of 23.1%. Adjusted EPS increased 17% to $11.12 per share. The Life Sciences solutions segment is its largest segment along with the highest profitability, followed by Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and then Laboratory products and services segment.Source: IntrinioTo assess relative performance, I have created a peer group that includes Danaher (DHR), Bruker (BRKR), Bio-Rad (BIO), Illumina (ILMN), Agilent (A), Becton, Dickinson (BDX), and Waters (WAT). Returns among these peers show a range of correlations with statistical significance in all cases. But DHR and BDX are closer in terms of peer given their similarity in size.Source: Raw data from Intrinio, calculations by the author.The calculations are based on quarterly data starting from 2011. Thermo Fisher has successfully grown its revenue year after year, maintaining roughly 11% in profit margin. BDX is the only firm in the peer group of similar size that delivered a slightly better result than Thermo Fisher, but its CFO to revenue averaged negative, making it not better than TMO from a broad perspective. It is difficult for firms with such size to maintain growth and profitability at the same time, this is only possible with highly skilled management and superb product engineering teams.Source: IntrinioData indicates that TMO has invested a lower portion of its revenue its R&D, and yet, the firm continues to produce excellent results. This could reflect the firm's superior innovation and capital deployment skills.Source: IntrinioHistorically, the largest peers in the group (DHR, TMO, BDX) had a similar trend in their price to sales ratios.Source: IntrinioLatest data shows that TMO's P/S is greater than its peers while its P/E is somewhat in the middle. From a broad perspective, it looks like TMO is appropriately priced. Without any pullbacks, holding seems prudent.Source: IntrinioThermo Fisher is a leader in the scientific device field. The firm has produced stellar results this year as indicated by a number of metrics. The firm thrives on innovation, as reflected in its product developments every year.

4164719,103888,2018-04-23T02:03:37-04:00,Thermo Fisher Scientific is a $86 billion giant in the life sciences industry.I like it because of its attractive revenue sourcing as well as its recently increased (albiet tiny) dividend.Large amounts of goodwill on the balance sheet and a lofty multiple make me reluctant to add to my stake at current levels.,"One company which has benefited from the growth of the life sciences industry is Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO). Thermo Fisher Scientific is a relatively recent creation, coming about in 2006 as the result of a merger between Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific. However, both of these companies have a rich heritage, with Fisher Scientific getting its start in 1902 and Thermo Electron being founded in 1956.Since joining forces, the combined company has grown into a giant within the life sciences industry. Thermo Fisher serves over 400,000 customers within the life sciences industry. Their customer base runs the gamut from biotech companies to hospitals to government agencies. The company sells this customer base everything from disposable gloves to mass spectrometers to next-generation gene sequencing services. The distribution of these revenues is probably my favorite part of the Thermo Fisher story. Thermo Fisher sources more than half of its revenue from sales of consumable products, such as disposable gloves and laboratory reagents. This is a boon for Thermo Fisher shareholders because it means that, once acquired, customers purchasing consumable products from Thermo Fisher will likely become a recurring source of revenue. This is also true of the revenues that Thermo Fisher derives from services.Source: Thermo Fisher 2017 Annual ReportThermo Fisher's revenue mix also benefits from being geographically diversified. Almost half of its revenues are sourced from outside of the United States. While current trade tensions may make this a somewhat risky short- to medium- term strategy, I believe that in the long term Thermo Fisher's strong position overseas will allow it to grow earnings at a rapid rate as emerging markets develop their own pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. This is particularly true of China, which already accounts for 10% of the company's revenue.Source: Thermo Fisher 2017 Annual ReportIn addition to excellent operating margins, M&A has powered Thermo Fisher's steady growth. Over the years, Thermo Fisher has steadily gobbled up entire companies in order to broaden its product offerings and to cement its place as a leader in the life sciences market. One of Thermo Fisher's most recent acquisitions was its $7.2 billion purchase of Patheon. This transaction added Patheon's contract drug manufacturing capabilities to Thermo Fisher's portfolio of services. Acquisitions like this one allow Thermo Fisher to expand into new niches of the life sciences and biotechnology markets, capturing more of the value chain that goes into developing new pharma and biotech products.One potential cause for concern is the risk that Thermo Fisher is overpaying for its acquisitions. This overpayment is particularly relevant in today's overvalued bull market, which has boosted valuations of publicly-traded companies to historically high levels. Usually, companies account for this overpayment by carrying it on their balance sheets as so-called ""goodwill"", which is supposed to represent the intangible value of an acquired company over and above the net value of its constituent assets. As of the end of the year 2017, roughly 45% of the assets listed on Thermo Fisher's consolidated balance sheet were accounted for as ""Goodwill"". This may seem like a startlingly high figure, but it is important to remember that Thermo Fisher operates in an industry that is enjoying a relatively rapid rate of growth. In such circumstances, the additional revenue growth afforded by paying a certain amount of goodwill for acquisitions can be justified.To get a sense of just how much ""goodwill"" is being generated by Thermo Fisher's most recent acquisitions, I have analyzed the company's breakdown of the value of each of its major acquisitions over the past two years. This information is available in the 2017 10-K filing. I have tabulated the percentage of the purchase price for each acquisition that Thermo Fisher accounts for as ""goodwill"" and highlighted it in red on the chart below.As the chart illustrates, goodwill makes up a significant portion of the cost of Thermo Fisher's recent acquisitions. At the same time, raw percentages do not tell the whole story. The acquisitions with the two highest proportions of goodwill - Core Informatics and Finesse Solutions - were relatively small ($94M and $221M respectively) compared to the $7.2 billion spent on Patheon. It is also important to recognize that Core Informatics and Finesse Solutions are primarily software companies, which means they will be relatively asset-light. As such any acquisition of such companies will be accompanied by a large amount of ""goodwill"". Overall, I think that Thermo Fisher is paying a relatively high price for its acquisitions, but not so high that they will not be accretive to earnings, in the long run, should current revenue trends continue.In today's low-interest rate world, it is a virtual given that any major string of corporate acquisition is likely being funded by a massive issuance of debt. Thermo Fisher is no exception to this phenomenon, as the chart below shows.Fortunately, Thermo Fisher's debt maturities are relatively evenly spaced out over the next decade or so. Most of its borrowings are also of the fixed-rate variety, which limits the amount of damage that a sudden rise in global interest rates would do to its ability to cover its debt repayment obligations. Nonetheless, Thermo Fisher estimated in its most recent 10-K filing that a 100 basis point jump in interest rates would increase the company's annual pre-tax interest expense by about $44 million. Thermo Fisher's 2017 interest expense stood at about $592 million, so this should not pose too much of a difficulty for the company.Thermo Fisher offers its shareholders a dividend yield of 0.3%. While its initial yield is laughable, this might change over the long term. Earlier this year, the company announced its intention to raise its dividend by 13% over its previous annual payout. While it is impossible to extrapolate from a single dividend hike, it is possible that income investors who buy in now could be in for a steadily increasing stream of dividend income, as management decides to return more of its cash to shareholders via dividends as opposed to directing it into M&A transactions.Thermo Fisher is an attractive company in an attractive industry. Its position as a leader in the life sciences industry, as well as its broad international exposure, should help to fuel earnings growth for years to come. At the same time, Thermo Fisher's extensive use of M&A could come back to haunt it should it have to write down the value of the $25 billion or so worth of goodwill that it carries on its balance sheet. The company also trades at a somewhat lofty valuation of 38 times earnings. Income investors might want to dip a toe into this name in order to potentially gain exposure to the rapidly-growing life sciences industry. However, I am currently waiting for more information about the future trajectory of Thermo Fisher's dividend payout before adding more capital to my small stake in this company.Disclaimer: Use my work as a starting point for your own due diligence, not as a substitute.

4136884,104067,2018-01-11T09:24:03-05:00,"Thermo Fisher offers premier exposure to a non-cyclical industry with relatively low competition that has allowed the company to create an incredibly large advantage over peers.Extremely strong cash flow metrics including near 25% pure FFO margins and a strong growth profile will ultimately flow-down to shareholders through time.Strong non-organic growth and capital efficiency/discipline creates risk to the upside for investors if 2018 sees continued bolt-on acquisitions in high growth segments.While unlikely to offer huge short-term returns, we view Thermo as a core healthcare holding that one must have exposure to within its portfolio that offers low/mid double-digit returns.","Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) is a non-cyclical healthcare company that offers exposure to the macro healthcare sector as a whole. The company operates globally with its largest portion of revenues from the United States. Its four primary segments are its Life Sciences Solutions segment, Analytical Instruments segment, Specialty Diagnostics segment, and Laboratory Products and Services segment.(Source: Company presentation, 36th Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference)Life Sciences Solutions products generally include instruments, consumables, and similar items used in the fields of medical and biological research. The segment as a whole is the company's most profitable, as it has a near monopoly on many of the commodity items needed within the research fields. It specifically caters to the needs of specialized bioscience, genetic, and bioproduction companies and research clinics.Analytical Instruments generally includes software, services, and measuring instruments utilized within laboratories. The segment is further broken down into the sub-segments of Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry, Chemical Analysis, and Materials/Structure analysis. This segment as a whole offers the highest growth profile among the four due to the increasing needs and complexity of research today combined with advances in general healthcare software products.Specialty Diagnostics offers clinical and other diagnostics items and instruments with uses in various health-related fields such as transplants, microbiology, pathology, and clinical testing.Laboratory Products and Services provides virtually all needed laboratory products including things like cell culture dishes, temperature control technologies, water measurement products, and items related to certain clinical trials.When looking at Thermo from an investor standpoint, the two major things that stand out upon analysis are the company's strong cash flow generation and a consistent growth profile. In 2016 and 2017, the company has experienced accelerating growth amid a wave of increased discovery and research within the general healthcare sector. This tidal wave has additionally coincided with the company's expansion of its vast product offerings through strategic acquisitions and has allowed the company to experience expected 12.50% top-line growth this year.On a margin basis, the company has fairly consistent 23-24% operating margins, but what really stands out is its ability to generate cash. Total FFO for 2017 is expected to be approximately $3.30 bn and our projections see this growing to $4.70 bn in 2018 as the company is able to successfully implement a number of recent acquisitions. This near 20% cash margin is a major highlight in our view from an investor perspective given how non-cyclical the industry is. It further gives the company huge capital flexibility in adapting to any changes within the healthcare space as a whole through investment in organic growth or acquisitions of specialized companies that allow a strong internal pivot.The major catalyst for growth for the company will likely be continued expansion within Asia and emerging markets. Specifically, the market is expected to grow exponentially through 2022. The company further sees 22% of its current revenues from these areas and is experiencing mid/high teens CAGR in revenues from the region.(Source: Company presentation, 36th Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference)Further providing a major tailwind for this growth is an acceleration in the pharmaceuticals and biotech markets within the area. While domestic generics and specialty pharmaceuticals companies have been harmed by increased drug filings by international researchers, Thermo is actually a beneficiary as it is able to leverage its portfolio of research products specifically designed for the space. This has led to record filings of generic applications to the FDA in 2018, with a large portion of this being Chinese generics competitors. This wave of filings is unlikely to abate in the near term and will likely continue to benefit Thermo over the coming years.(Source: Bloomberg, FDA)Further providing tailwinds for the company is the general global growth dynamic, with the company generating approximately 25% of revenues through industrial and applied industries including such areas as energy and semiconductors. It is likely that these trends will continue moving forward and that these trends will further support growth in top-line.Providing further upside potential for Thermo is the company's incredibly strong ability to identify, acquire, and integrate bolt-on acquisitions at a record base. The company has a long line of successful acquisitions over recent years with its most recent being the acquisition of Patheon which closed in August. The company was a premier provider in its space and will be included under Thermo's analytical instruments segment. Furthermore, synergies through the deal moving forward are expected to be in the hundreds of millions.(Source: Thermo Fisher FY2016 investor earnings presentation)Building on this, the company announced during the most recent quarter that the Patheon acquisition integration was going faster than previously thought, thus resulting in increases in FY2017 guidance. This illustrates both how conservative the company is when it comes to issuing guidance and also its ability and expertise in the acquisitions space. Given the company's dominance in what is generally an extremely scattered industry, it makes sense that there are numerous attractive acquisition targets that can see significantly increased profitability through the integration into the company's extremely robust supply chain and distribution network.Furthermore, looking forward, the company has guided continued deployment of capital in the M&A market, with expectations of approximately $7.50 bn in acquisitions between now and 2020. Given the company's track record with these acquisitions, it is our thought that there is huge risk to the upside with these acquisitions if the company's track record is any indication. Thus the company's revenue and earnings guidance are realistically incredibly conservative as management appears to be guiding numbers for growth through primarily organic expansion with generally extremely conservative non-organic growth guidance.(Source: Thermo Fisher FY2016 investor earnings presentation)Looking at our valuation and construction of an operating model for the company, we valued it both on a forward PE, EV/EBITDA, and P/CF basis in addition to using a general DCF build.We start with our revenue build:(Source: Self-made model, historical numbers from Company filings)On our projections, we assumed that 2018-2020 growth would be outside the company's guided 4-6% range. We based this on expectations of the company being incredibly conservative on its guidance as it will likely do numerous bolt-on acquisitions over this period given the backdrop of strong global growth and opportunities in emerging markets. We tapered this growth in the long term.On the margin front, we increased margins in-line with guidance of approximately 50-70 bps widening per year through 2021 with a longer-term operating margin target of 25-26%. Other line items we kept relatively in-line with historical.This leads to our income statement:(Source: Self-made model, historical numbers from Company filings)Moving to our statement of cash-flows:(Source: Self-made model, historical numbers from Company filings)We kept all working capital numbers generally in-line with historicals. Due to our revenue build methodology and lack of specific line items associated with inventory and similar, we made the major drivers for working capital assumptions primarily percentage of sales or opex based.An additional point to note is we assumed $1.20 bn in share buybacks per year through 2020 as the company guided $12 bn in capital deployment with 65% for acquisitions and 35% for share buybacks. The company's cash flow generation will likely allow the funding of these acquisitions through primarily cash with potential for slight amounts of debt being taken out as well. We chose only to model the share buybacks however as those appear more certain as of this point in time.Finally to our balance sheet:(Source: Self-made model, historical numbers from Company filings)Looking at our DCF valuation, we projected out the following free cash flows, WACC, and sensitivity analysis:(Source: Self-made model, historical numbers from Company filings)An exit multiple of 20x was chosen on an EV/EBITDA basis which is a slight premium to the industry average of 18x and where it is currently trading. We justified this slight premium due to the company's strong growth profile combined with its wide competitive moat.Similarly, a 2.50% perpetuity growth rate was chosen as the company will likely continue to experience cash flow growth around this rate in the long term as it is heavily leveraged to global healthcare spending and research which will likely continue to increase substantially in the long term.We additionally valued the company on a comparables basis:(Source: Self-made model)We used a 32.5/20/18 comparables set on the assumed rate the company trades at historically and its peer group. For the P/E ratio, please note that the company typically reports adjusted earnings; however, we utilized GAAP EPS. The implied multiple of 32.5x on GAAP EPS translates to an around 18x multiple on adjusted EPS which we believe is justified given the company's strength and growth profile.Looking at our valuation breadth, it appears that the company on its 2018 comps basis is somewhat fairly valued. However, the company offers a much better growth profile as seen on its implied 2019 multiples valuations on our estimates and our DCF model of assumed strong inorganic growth through 2020.Furthermore, we generally view there being risk to the upside on stronger than projected inorganic growth or margin expansion, with potential for a dividend hike/expanded share buybacks above what is guided given how strong the company's cash flow generation is.Generally, we view Thermo as an incredibly stable company with a wide competitive advantage over peers, and thus there are no major inherent risks associated with the company given its strong non-cyclical product base.The most obvious risk in our analysis is obviously the above guided revenue growth rate. If the company is unable to incorporate profitable, bolt-on acquisitions over the coming years, it is likely that top-line growth will average the midpoint of guidance of 4-6% rather than our more aggressive rate of 7-8%. With this being said, however, adjusting estimates to the low end of the guided range, we still come to the conclusion that at worst, the company is currently fairly valued and does not have substantial implied downside.Another risk is with regard to the company's emerging markets exposure. If Asia specifically enters a period of recession or economic struggle, it is likely that this high growth segment of the company's operations would experience significant reductions in growth. We see this as unlikely, however, given the strong momentum of India and the strong government/fiscal intervention in China.Finally, there is additionally the added currency risk for the company, with approximately 50% of earnings in international territories. Given the current weakness of the dollar, however, and the accelerating global environment outside of the United States, we view the chances of a rapid strengthening of the dollar as remote as of this point in time. It does remain a concern for longer-term holders, however.Thermo Fisher represents an incredibly stable, fundamentally strong holding that offers exposure to the global healthcare sector as a whole. Its strong cash flow generation and expertise in bolt-on acquisitions have resulted in a fundamental behemoth of a company being able to establish significant market share and competitive advantage within the space. It is our view that the company will likely continue its domination of the industry, spurred by tailwinds of accelerating global growth and development of more advanced healthcare markets in emerging markets specifically.On a valuation basis, we see as much as 25% upside, with risk skewed further to the upside if M&A targets over the coming years result in significantly higher growth for the company's top-line. Furthermore, the company's cost-cutting measures and focus on internal optimization will further drive earnings growth, with dividends and share buybacks likely to continue to be substantial for years to come.Overall, Thermo Fisher is a must hold for any diversified portfolio, and it offers stability in a sector that is typically prone to volatility."
4251426,58061,2019-03-27T19:03:51-04:00,"Thermo Fisher acquires gene therapy contract manufacturing development organization Brammer Bio for $1.7 billion in cash.Brammer Bio has experience in helping pharmaceutical companies in ex vivo and in vivo clinical trial development with the use of viral vectors.Brammer Bio is on track to deliver $250 million in revenue in 2019, which should provide a nice boost for Thermo's pharma services business unit growth in the coming years.The FDA has needed to expand clinical reviewers to handle the incoming 200+ IND gene therapy applications expected by 2020 as this space continues to grow at an alarming rate.","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) made a bold strategic move to acquire a gene therapy manufacturer known as Brammer Bio. This was done to get some type of position into the ever-growing gene therapy space. The sector is starting to expand with additional new biotechs seeking to explore the treatment of gene therapies against rare diseases. It is expected that the FDA will need to hire additional personnel to handle all the new developments being sought out for in this space. The takeaway is that Thermo Fisher's latest acquisition will only serve to boost revenue growth over time.Thermo Fisher offered to buy Brammer Bio with $1.7 billion in cash. This deal is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2019. Of course, this is if all closing conditions are met. The transaction will move Brammer Bio into Thermo Fisher's pharma services business unit within the laboratory products and services category. The reason why it is going into this category is that Brammer Bio is a contract manufacturing development organization (CMDO). What that means is that it will provide pharmaceutical companies with the means to deliver gene therapy products. It will accomplish this task by giving out its expertise and manufacturing capabilities with viral vectors. As you may know by now, viral vectors are starting to be used by a host of gene therapy companies to deliver genetic material to the intended targets to treat rare genetic diseases. Viral vectors are not the only type of delivery for gene therapy, but they are also starting to be used by a lot of biotechs.Brammer Bio has experience in helping pharmaceutical companies testing these products in ex vivo and in vivo clinical trials. In essence, Brammer Bio will offer services to help these companies bring a product from development to commercialization. In my opinion, this deal is a good fit. That's because Thermo Fisher will offer its GMP capabilities, while Brammer Bio will provide its expertise in viral vector use for gene therapy delivery. Brammer Bio has done pretty well for itself, considering the first gene therapy approval came about back in 2017. It has about 600 employees and is on track to deliver $250 million in revenue for 2019. I expect that Thermo Fisher's services unit in 2020 will only get better, especially now that it can offer viral vector services to any pharmaceutical company looking to get into the gene therapy field. The deal cost Thermo Fisher $1.7 billion. That may seem like a lot of cash, but the company will not be affected in the slightest by this outflow. That's because it makes more than enough revenue per year to easily offset this. The reason why I state that is because it reported revenue growth of 16% to $24.36 billion for all of 2018. Initially, the $250 million in revenue will be a minor boost overall. However, as Thermo Fisher continues to add new customers to its gene therapy services unit, the revenue should start to climb over time.There has been a massive surge in the amount of biotechs looking to get into the gene therapy field. Not only for small-cap biotechs but also for big pharmaceutical companies as well. Big pharmaceuticals have been dishing out a lot of cash to become heavily invested in the gene therapy space. For instance, I previously wrote an article on SA dealing with Pfizer's (PFE) partnership with Vivet Therapeutics. Specifically, Pfizer took a 15% stake in the private French biotech company that deals with gene therapy. Pfizer holds the option to eventually acquire it if the initial trials prove to be successful. This will deal with the phase 1/2 study using VTX-801 to treat patients with a rare liver disorder known as Wilson's disease. Biogen (BIIB) purchased Nightstar Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NITE) for $25.50 per share at the beginning of this month. The reason why Biogen acquired this gene therapy biotech was to obtain the ability to treat rare genetic eye diseases. Then, you also have AbbVie (ABBV) which decided to expand a prior deal it had made with Voyager Therapeutics (VYGR) to treat patients with neurological disorders. The FDA is scrambling to add additional personnel to handle the host of applications it will be receiving in the gene therapy space. It will do so by adding about 50 clinical reviewers who will be responsible for establishing guidelines and reviewing applications in this space. The FDA expects at least 200 IND applications by 2020. This will come from a lot of pharmaceutical companies looking to enter this field. There is a huge surge in this cell and gene therapy field, therefore, it is good that the FDA is setting up the proper guidelines to handle these types of companies. It will help carve out a path necessary to get these gene therapies from development to commercialization.Thermo Fisher made a smart move in that it will help add to its pharma services business unit. It will also fall in line with the company's goal of helping innovation come to life, through the guidance of viral vector gene therapy development. Viral vectors have been shown to be safe and tolerable in patients. Even better, the technology has proven to deliver packaged genes to the intended targets to treat rare genetic disease in an effective manner. There are a few types of risks that must be noted in relation to this acquisition. The first of which is the newly added Brammer Bio itself. Both companies must align their development capabilities together, to better serve biotech companies looking into the gene therapy space. The second risk comes from the crowded gene therapy field itself. As I have demonstrated above, there are going to be 200+ IND applications by 2020. A majority of which are using viral vectors to deliver genetic materials. That means there will be a lot of competition in this space. It is important to see if Thermo's pharma services business unit continues to grow, despite the ever-increasing competition. I think that Thermo Fisher will do well with its latest acquisition. Especially, when you consider that each company brings its own unique capability to the table to help its customers build a gene therapy powerhouse treatment. Thermo Fisher was a solid buy before the acquisition of Brammer Bio, but I believe it's even more so now after getting a gene therapy services company."
4299710,105284,2019-10-28T17:29:42-04:00,Thermo Fisher has been successful for many years at acquiring and integrating related companies but seems to be reorienting to organic growth.The company's push into contract development and manufacturing should drive organic growth going forward.These great operations come at a high valuation. Dividend policy could also be more generous.Thermo Fisher stock is a good long-term hold. I would wait for a pullback or significant dividend increase before adding shares.,"Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) provides laboratory equipment, consumables, and services predominantly in the healthcare sector but in other manufacturing applications as well. After several years of successful growth by acquisition, the company is shifting more toward organic growth, especially through expanding its contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO, capabilities. Additionally, Thermo is demonstrating success at growing the business globally in regions where other companies have been less successful lately. Thermo exhibited high single-digit sales growth in its most recent earnings release, and I expect this to continue without major M&A activity.Shares of Thermo Fisher, like many of its peers in the Life Sciences Tools & Services industry, are trading at a high valuation based on P/E. Thermo also shares a miserly dividend policy with its industry peers. With a quarterly payout of $0.19/share, the company's payout ratio is only 6% of 2019 earnings for a dividend yield of 0.25%.Thermo Fisher has demonstrated its ability to generate growth both by acquisition and organically. 3Q results particularly provide encouragement that the organic growth can continue. It is a well-run company that will hold its value over the long term, but the current valuation is fair, given its growth rate and comparable company valuations. At these valuations, I also believe the company should be increasing dividends rather than continuing buybacks. I would wait for a general market pullback or a significant dividend increase before adding more shares.Thermo Fisher was created in 2006 through the merger of analytical instrument manufacturer Thermo Electron and lab products and services company Fisher Scientific. Since then, the company has grown through several large acquisitions which have helped the company double its sales and gross profit over the last 7 years. Thermo Fisher has been successful at efficiently integrating these acquisitions as net income tripled over this time frame. Capital management has also been a success, with share count increasing only modestly and net debt/EBITDA little changed over this time period.Data Source: Seeking Alpha Key Data PageIn the last two years, Thermo Fisher slowed down its pace of acquisitions with a couple smaller deals in 2018 and with the $1.7 billion purchase of Brammer Bio in 2019, offset by the $1.1 billion sale of the anatomical pathology business. Nevertheless, growth has continued based on the recent 3Q 2019 earnings release.Three out of four of Thermo's segments showed revenue growth. Only the smallest, Specialty Diagnostics, showed a small decline due to the sale of the anatomical pathology segment. All segments had either flat or higher operating income. The best performing segment was Life Sciences Solutions with 13% growth in sales and 18% growth in operating income compared to 3Q 2018. This segment also improved its already high operating margin to 34.5% from 32.9%. Thermo made a great deal when they bought this division in 2014 as it has been the growth engine for the company relative to the larger but low-margin, slower-growing Lab Products and Services.Source: Thermo Fisher 3Q 2019 Earnings ReleaseThe company raised its EPS guidance for 2019 to $12.28-12.34/share (non-GAAP), which works out to a P/E of about 24. Thermo's non-GAAP results exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Because of the many acquisitions over the past decade, GAAP EPS is significantly below non-GAAP. Based on YTD actuals and 4Q guidance, Thermo's GAAP EPS will be around $9.36 for the full year for a GAAP-based P/E around 32.Thermo highlighted contract manufacturing as an important growth area. They recently expanded their St. Louis facility to be the largest CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) in North America and also opened a new training facility in North Carolina. The company also grew their contract manufacturing through M&A with the purchase of Brammer Bio and a GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) facility in Ireland.Contract development and manufacturing is a growing service in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Development of new drugs is becoming more complex, taking longer, and is subject to more regulation than in the past. This complexity also leads to a greater chance of failure during the development cycle. This has led drug companies to outsource development and manufacturing to CDMOs to take advantage of their infrastructure and expertise, reducing internal capital and operating expenses. The CDMO industry is growing at 6% to 7% annually, faster than the pharma sector average, according to a report from consultant EY.This report, as well as other industry sources, highlights the benefit of full-service CDMOs that can partner with drug companies through the entire product life cycle from testing through scale-up and manufacturing. The CDMO space is a logical opportunity for vertical integration for Thermo Fisher as the CDMOs use Thermo's analytical instruments, lab supplies, and diagnostic tools. The company entered this space in a big way with the 2017 acquisition of Patheon, and with the expansion of the St. Louis facility, it's now growing its CDMO capabilities organically.Geographically, Thermo Fisher's growth profile was a bit different than one would expect from reading general macro headlines. North America grew in mid-single digits while Europe and Asia both grew in high single digits with China sales specifically up 13%. Thermo offers technologies and products that China needs to develop its own healthcare industry but cannot yet produce internally. CEO Marc Casper discussed this on the conference call:Source: Thermo Fisher 3Q 2019 Earnings CallThe company highlighted the expansion of its Suzhou facility to support clinical trials and expanded its customer demonstration and training center in Shanghai.Pharma is one of the key industries targeted in the ""Made in China 2025"" policy in which China seeks to develop its own technology through increased R&D. As China plays catch-up with the West in its drug development capabilities, Thermo Fisher is well positioned to provide the tools and services needed.Europe was another bright spot, contrary to general macro trends:Source: Thermo Fisher 3Q 2019 Earnings CallThermo Fisher generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow YTD, plus $1.1 billion from the anatomical pathology sale for a total of $3.5 billion of cash generation. $1.7 billion was spent on the Brammer Bio acquisition and another $1.7 billion on debt paydown. They also spent about $0.6 billion on share buybacks (net of new issuance) and $0.2 billion on the dividend for a cash draw YTD of $0.8 billion.For such an acquisitive company, Thermo Fisher has done a good job managing its share dilution and debt ratio. Share count stands less than 10% above where it was in 2012 despite a tripling of net income. The company's preference has been to use excess cash on share buybacks rather than pay more than a token dividend. After the quarter ended, Thermo bought back another $750 million worth of stock for a gross buyback of $1.5 billion YTD. This makes 2019's buyback the highest dollar amount of the past several years, at prices nearly double those of only three years ago. While the low dividend does provide flexibility to take advantage of M&A opportunities, I believe the valuation is getting high enough that management should seriously consider dividends over buybacks.Source: Thermo Fisher 3Q 2019 Reconciliation of Financial InformationOn the debt side, Thermo's gross debt is now $17.1 billion. Subtracting cash of $1.3 billion results in net debt of $15.8 billion. With 2019 EBITDA of about $6.6 billion, net debt/EBITDA is down to 2.4, or the same level as in 2012 before the string of large acquisitions. Additionally, after the end of the quarter, the company refinanced about $5.6 billion worth of debt at an average interest rate of 1.5%, or half of the rate on the retired debt. This move alone will improve EPS by about $0.20/year. These improved debt levels and low interest rates should also encourage management to be a little more generous with the dividend.On the table below, I compare Thermo Fisher with 4 peers in the Life Sciences and Tools industry. Thermo is at the low end of the range on P/E, but also at the low end on growth rate, resulting in a middle-of-range PEG ratio. Looking at profitability ratios, Thermo is second lowest return on equity, assets, and total capital. There is no strong argument here for a significantly higher valuation for Thermo.Data Source: Seeking Alpha Peers Comparison PageLooking at historical P/E, Thermo has averaged around 30 since the beginning of its strong growth phase in 2014 with slightly higher values since the start of 2018. Given the improving balance sheet and good execution by management, the current valuation slightly above the long-term average also seems fair.Source: Seeking Alpha Valuation PageThermo Fisher has delivered impressive growth since it embarked on a series of large acquisitions in 2014. As the buying spree lessened over the last two years, the company has continued to grow organically. Organic growth should continue as the company expands contract development and manufacturing. The company will also continue to capitalize on China's desire to expand its pharma and biotech capabilities by delivering the needed products and services. The company has managed its balance sheet well, growing share count only slightly and keeping net debt/EBITDA at a manageable level.Thermo appears around fairly valued compared to its peers and its own history. Given current valuation and the lower frequency of large acquisitions, management should consider shifting the balance of capital return more toward dividends and away from buybacks. I continue to hold Thermo in my portfolio but would not add more shares at these levels. I would suggest waiting for a general market pullback to take the trailing P/E below 30 before starting a new position. Dividend growth investors especially should wait another quarter to see if management announces a significant increase in the dividend as opposed to expensive buybacks."
4245678,104958,2019-03-01T11:00:18-05:00,"Thermo Fisher is a profitable company with moderate debt levels.
        The company’s earnings have shown strong growth over the last five years with more growth expected for 2020.
        Management is proactive and will divest any business unit that underperforms and replace it with new acquisitions that have the potential to perform.
        Thermo Fisher sees further growth opportunities in China.","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) is a global company in the medical research industry providing instruments, equipment and software. The company’s has shown solid growth over the years and more growth is forecast for 2020.Management is proactive and seeks out opportunities. The company’s acquisition strategy is to look for businesses that will provide future growth and management will even divest its own business units if they underperform. Also, the company is expanding its operations in emerging markets as a means of boosting growth.Over the long term I think that Thermo Fisher has the potential to grow well into the future along with its stock price.Thermo Fisher has reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018 (data from Seeking Alpha and Gurofocus).The company’s reported forth quarter revenue was up 7.6 percent and reported diluted earnings per share up 70 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017.On an annual basis, revenue for 2018 was up 16 percent and diluted earnings per share up 29 percent from the 2017 fiscal year. Over the last five years Thermo Fisher’s revenue grew 9.6 percent per year and its earnings increased 11.3 percent per year.Thermo Fisher’s return on equity is fair at 11 percent. Over the last five years its return on equity has mostly been just under 10 percent. The profit margin (profit to revenue ratio) is good at 12 percent. The profit margin has been fairly consistent over the last five years.Thermo Fisher’s current ratio is 1.7 meaning that its current assets exceed its current liabilities. The current ratio has average 1.5 aver the last five years.The asset ratio (total liabilities to total assets) is 51 percent which means that Thermo Fisher’s total debt is 51 percent of the value of everything the company owns (note that the asset value is the book value and not the liquidated value of its assets). Over the last five years the asset ratio has been consistent at around 50 percent.The company’s book value is currently $68.62 and with a stock price of $254 Thermo Fisher is trading at 3.7x book value.The analysts’ consensus forecast is for revenue to increase by 3.4 percent in 2019 and increase 5.6 percent in 2020. Earnings are forecast to increase by 36 percent in 2019 and increase by 16 percent in 2020. The 2020 PE ratio is 22x.The financials reveal Thermo Fisher is a profitable company that operates with a moderate amount of debt.Thermo Fisher invested $0.9 billion in research and development. This represents a third of its 2018 net income of $2.94 billion. This is quite a significant sum, but Thermo Fisher must invest this to remain ahead of its competition. Thermo Fisher has plenty of competition. Two large competitors are Becton, Dickinson and Company with revenues of $16 billion and Danaher Corporation with $20 billion in revenues. While Thermo Fisher is ahead of its compitition with $24 billion in revenue, it could easily loose its position if the other two up their their R&D spending to produce better and/or cheaper products. If this happens then Thermo Fisher would have to respond with increasing its R&D budget (which will reduce its net income) or it will have to reduce prices (if competitors new products are the same but cheaper). The end result is the same - reduced net income for Thermo Fisher. The company has a strong history of growth which can be largely attributed to its acquisition strategy.Its latest proposed acquisition of Roper Technologies Gatan unit for $925 million has hit a snag with the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (NYSE:CMA) having raised concerns that competition would be reduced for customers using their specialized microscopes. The concerns raised by CMA were that it would lead to higher prices or lower quality products. The acquisition if approved by CMA would generate $150 million in revenue (which represents 16 percent of its purchase cost). Over the last four years Thermo Fisher has successfully acquired 9 businesses and divested one of its own businesses.Thermo Fisher will divest its anatomical pathology business for $1.1 billion to Japan’s PHC Holdings Corporation. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019. This business unit is one of Thermo Fisher’s more mature businesses with a shrinking client base and is under pricing pressure from its competitors.Thermo Fisher has a market-cap of around $100 billion and generates around $24 billion in revenue. This means its revenue represents 24 percent of its market-cap value. The anatomical pathology business unit generated only $85 million in revenue for the $1.1 billion it sold for. This represents only 8 percent of its value. I can see why management wanted to divest this business unit – its revenue potential is only one-third that of the company overall.I think that getting rid of an underperforming business unit is a good move as the last thing Thermo Fisher needs is a business unit to drag down its growth. This also provides cash form the sale of anatomical pathology that Thermo Fisher can use to buy another business with better revenue prospects.I like this proactive nature – sell underperforming business units and replacing them with business units that have growth potential.Thermo Fisher has completed 9 acquisitions since 2015 with the most recent acquisition of Advanced Bioprocessing for $477 million in cash. The acquisition was completed in October last year and is expected to add $100 million in revenue (which represents 21 percent of its purchase cost). Now this is more to management’s likings – 21 percent is in the ball park for Thermo Fisher's 24 percent revenue to value ratio.Thermo Fisher’s largest acquisition since 2015 was Patheon N.V. (a NYSE listed company) which was acquired for $7.2 billion in cash. The acquisition was completed in August 2017 and adds $1.9 billion in revenue (which represents 26 percent of its purchase cost). Again this is in the ball park for Thermo Fisher’s revenue of 24 percent of its market value.While Thermo Fisher produces growth through its acquisitions strategy, it also generates growth from expanding into foreign markets.As stated by Marc Casper - President and CEO in their earnings call,I like that the company is positioning itself in these emerging markets. They provide further growth opportunities since these regions are less developed but are catching up with the traditional western markets. Also India and China have enormous populations and while there will naturally be competition these markets are large and would more readily absorb the competition.Marc Casper added,Considering that China is Thermo Fisher’s largest market outside of the United States, I think it’s a good move by management to pursue this market as there’s significant potential to boost its future earnings growth.As for India, the Indian government wants to turn the country into a worldwide leader in the drug manufacturing industry. This will directly benefit Thermo Fisher’s as they provide many of the instrumental equipment used within the drug manufacturing industry.I think that Thermo Fisher is well placed for future growth. The company is proactive and will divest business units if they underperform. Their future growth will come from their acquisition strategy along with their expansion into global markets.Thermo Fisher has a solid history of growth and this growth is expected to continue heading into 2020. An appropriate method for valuing growth stocks is the PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate).The historical earnings growth is 11.3 percent per year and its forecast 2020 growth rate is 16 percent per year. The average growth from 2014 until 2020 is 15 percent per year.With a 15 percent growth rate this gives a forward PEG of 1.5 with a 2020 PE multiple of 22x.It’s commonly accepted that a stock is fairly valued when its forward PEG is 1.0 which means that Thermo Fisher is overvalued with a stock price around $254. Its fair value would be around $170.While Thermo Fisher is overvalued it’s not that expensive with a PE multiple of 22x for its 2020 estimated earnings and a book value of 3.7x.As an active investor I personally like to determine some likely price targets. This gives me a feel for how high the stock price could go in the short term and how soon it could get there.Thermo Fisher chart by StockCharts.comThe stock chart reveals that Thermo Fisher’s stock price has increased considerably over the last decade. From 2012 the stock essentially traded straight up to peak in late 2018. From there the stock pulled back along with stock market. Since the start of this year the stock has rallied to make a new high.Should the stock keep rallying, in the short term it could replicate its 2018 advance where the stock ran up from $190 to peak at $250. This rally could be replicated in 2019 as long as the market continues to rally. The 2018 rally of $60 when added to the bottom of this year’s rally of $215 gives a target of $275 which could be reached by the end of the year.Over the longer term the stock has the potential to continue higher and will probably do so as long as its earnings growth continues. In the short term Thermo Fisher could trade sideways for a year or so like it did back in 2011. Thermo Fisher’s strong stock price gains are attributed to its strong earnings grow over the years. Should its earnings grow slow in the future then I would expect its stock price to become volatile.The stock market itself poses a risk. While its revenue and earnings were quite resilient during the last recession in 2008, its stock price did suffer with a significant decline during that period - having lost 45%.The current bull market started in 2009 and is one of the longest on record. The market has rallied so far this year after a significant pullback late last year. If this rally fails and the market trades back down then there’s the real possibility that a new bear market has begun.While Thermo Fisher’s revenue and earnings may be resilient, its stock price is not and in a bear market it would drop along with the market. However, due to its strong earnings growth it's stock price would recover quickly.Thermo Fisher is a growth stock with a solid history of growth. The analysts are forecasting more growth heading into 2020. The company is proactive divesting underperforming business units and replacing them with new businesses that have more revenue potential. Also, the company is expanding its operations in emerging markets as a means of boosting growth.Thermo Fisher is a profitable company that is well run with moderate debt levels. Over the long term I would expect the company’s earnings to continue higher along with its stock price."
4108497,103547,2017-09-21T08:11:18-04:00,"Thermo Fisher has achieved stellar growth in the last decade, more than tripling earnings per share.The company is projecting earnings growth of 12% to 15% per year in the near term.Shares seem fully valued at around $190, so investors may want to wait for a market correction in order to initiate a new position with a greater margin for error.","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) has more than doubled revenues over the last decade, and investors might start to ask if the pace can be sustained. The growth has been aided by a series of acquisitions, with the $7.2 billion dollar addition of Patheon being the most recent example. A look at Thermo Fisher's business and two of the recent key acquisitions should give us a good indication of where the company is heading in the next few years.With a catalog of over 650,000 products and a variety of clinical development offerings, Thermo Fisher is a one stop shop for chemical and life science researchers. The company's business consists of the sale of consumables and capital equipment, as well as a variety of service offerings. The business is organized into four different business segments: Laboratory Products and Services, Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, and Specialty Diagnostics.Slide from Thermo Fisher Scientific 2017 Annual Shareholders MeetingApproximately 25% of revenue is from government and academic customers, with approximately half of that in the domestic market, and no customer has accounted for more that 5% of sales in the last three years. Thermo Fisher's customer diversity looks to have it well insulated to the risks of individual customers, but cuts in Federal research expenditures could have a major impact on the business. The company expects sustained growth due to the underlying growth of the healthcare industry.Slide from Thermo Fisher Scientific 2017 Annual Shareholders MeetingIn addition to acquisitions, Thermo Fisher spends a significant amount on research and development, having spent $755 million in 2016. Thermo Fisher stated in their second quarter Q-10 (page 41) that they expect to spend approximately $500 million on property, plant, and equipment for 2017.All indications are that the company expects to achieve sustained growth in the near future. In fact, Thermo Fisher is targeting 4 to 6% annual organic revenue growth and 12 to 15% free cash flow growth in the coming years, as shown at a recent investor's day conference.Slide from Thermo Fisher Scientific 2017 Analyst Day PresentationIn addition to more than doubling revenue over the last decade, the company has nearly tripled net income, from $761 million in 2007 to $2.27 billion over the last twelve months. Shareholders have been rewarded over that period with earnings per share more than tripling.TMO Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsEarnings have grown faster than revenue by consistently increasing margins, which were achieved by economies of scale, efficiency efforts, and divestitures of low margin businesses. Gross margins have expanded by more than 7% over the decade, with net margins increasing by more than 4%. SG&A expenses grew at a slower rate than revenues over the same period.TMO Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsMuch of the recent success can be traced to major acquisitions. Let's take a look at two of the most recent deals, the purchase of Life Technologies and FEI.Thermo Fisher acquired Life Technologies Corporation in 2014 for a total price of $15.3 billion, including the assumption of debt. Life had revenues of $3.87 billion for the year and 18% operating income margin for the first nine months of 2013, the last quarter that a 10-Q was filed. In the most recent quarter, The Life Sciences Solutions segment, which consists mostly of the former Life Technologies business, reported a segment operating income margin of 31.9%. The margin expansion alone would account for nearly $500 million in cost synergies from the Life Technologies deal, given that the company stated in their Q2 release that they expect their effective tax rate to be ~3% for 2017.These numbers are before SG&A, restructuring charges, and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which are not broken out by business segment. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets constitutes the majority of these expenses, so much of the cost savings from the deal should translate into additional operating cash flow going forward.Although not considered in the above analysis, the Life Sciences Solutions segment has also experienced growth, reporting $4,978.1 billion in revenue in 2016. The segment reported revenues of $2,768.1 billion for the first six months of 2017, and revenues are typically higher in the second half of the year.One of the few downsides to the Life Technologies deal appears to be several intellectual property lawsuits. The company has maintained over $100 million in accruals for two of these cases, and settled two others earlier this year. However, the deal seems to have worked out well for Fisher Scientific and its shareholders.Thermo Fisher acquired FEI Company in September of 2016 for a net purchase price of $4.08 billion. For the first six months of 2017, the FEI acquisition resulted an increase in revenues of $596 million. For comparison, FEI generated $930 million in revenue with 16.3% operating margins in 2015, their last full year as an independent company. The company noted that operating income for the legacy FEI business was only $26 million due to costs related to the acquisition.Fisher notes in their 2017 10-K that capital sales are typically higher in the back half of the year due to customer's capital planning schedules, so it would be reasonable to assume that the legacy FEI business will generate revenues in excess of $1.2 billion over the course of 2017. Assuming the underlying business is capable of replicating the 16.3% operating margins that FEI had as a standalone company, that would equate to a projected profit of $196 million for the year. That would mean that Thermo Fisher made the acquisition at a P/E of 20.8 for the current FEI business, excluding restructuring charges. While certainly not a value play, the price could turn out to be fair if the unit can deliver revenue growth while maintaining margins.During the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference, CEO Marc Casper stated that FEI had generated nearly 15% growth in just under a year as part of Thermo Fisher. He also noted that the unit should realize more growth as its electron microscopy technology is applied to more life science applications. It seems it is too early to say how the FEI acquisition will turn out for Thermo Fisher, but indications are that it could be a win if the unit continues to grow at its current pace for several years.Patheon generated nearly $1.9 billion in revenue in 2016. Marc Casper stated during the Morgan Stanley Conference that he expects that Thermo Fisher can expand margins in the legacy Patheon business up to the high teens or even 20%. At the time of the deal, Thermo Fisher stated that the acquisition would be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings by $0.30 per share in the first full year after the deal. Three years after close, the deal is expected to generate $90 million in cost synergies and $30 million in revenue synergies.Thermo Fisher gave earnings guidance for the rest of the year in their Q2 earnings release, stating that they expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $9.15 to $9.28. If they achieve the target range, it would represent 11% to 12% growth in EPS versus 2016, which is in line with their stated goal of 12% to 15% growth in adjusted EPS per year. Assuming that Thermo Fisher can deliver on their growth targets through 2019, the company could deliver adjusted EPS of up to $12.27 in 2019.Projected Adjusted EarningsWith the current share price at $188.60, that would translate to a price to adjusted earnings per share range of 15.4 to 16.4 by the end of 2019. That earnings multiple seems very reasonable, especially considering the long-term growth prospects of the business. However, these numbers are based on an adjusted basis, and the restructuring charges and other adjustments have a real impact on cash flows.The company is currently trading at a price to free cash flow of 27.4. Thermo Fisher had free cash flow of $2.7 billion in 2016. If they achieve their stated goal of 12% to 15% free cash flow growth through 2019, this would lead to $3.8 to $4.1 billion in free cash flow by the end of 2019. With a current market cap of $75.2 billion, that would translate to a price to free cash flow in the range of 18.3 to 19.8.TMO Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsThat range of valuations appears on the upper end of fair value given the current interest rate environment, especially when it requires Thermo Fisher to achieve 12% to 15% growth for several years. If the shares were to pull back to $160, that would give a price to free cash flow range of 15.5 to 16.8 based on their projected 2019 numbers. That range seems more reasonable given the uncertainty in projecting multiple years of high earnings growth and the potential for market disruptions, such as Federal budget cuts.Thermo Fisher has a comprehensive life science research business that is likely to continue to grow organically and through acquisitions. The company looks well position to continue their run of impressive growth with the recent closing of the Patheon deal and the underlying growth rate of the healthcare market. However, shares currently appear to be fully valued, and I plan on waiting for a pull back in share price in order to have a wider margin of safety.If you would like to see more of my work, please follow me by clicking on the orange ""Follow"" button at the top of the article."
4175837,103307,2018-05-21T10:05:42-04:00,The first contract development and manufacturing organization industry deep dive in the series.Thermo Fisher is a life sciences heavyweight that made a splash in the CDMO space with its acquisition of Patheon for $7.2 billion in 2017.TMO's segments and how they are performing.Financials and valuation.TMO is a buy when a larger margin of safety appears.,"""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."" - Warren BuffettThis is the second article in my research series about the drug manufacturing industry. Here is the link to the first article in the series.SourceI thought I'd start the series with the heavyweight that encompasses just about everything in the health and life sciences domain. Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) is the $85 billion titan in the lucrative life sciences industry, producing everything from drugs to centrifuges to molecular probes. The company was created in 2006 after a merger between Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific and has grown in size using both organic and inorganic (acquisitions) means.SourceTMO's markets are well divided between industries (as seen above). This diversification helps with preventing sudden falls in revenue due to headwinds in a particular sector.SourceThe region breakdown where TMO sells is less diversified, but that can only be expected, as the U.S. is the world's largest spender in healthcare. Thermo Fisher also boasts a growing revenue stream from China, which now makes up 10% of its sales. This is an important area to pay attention to in future years as TMO attempts to grow its sales in the most populous country in the world as well as other ex-U.S. markets.SourceAnother interesting graph from Thermo Fisher's 2017 Annual Report. Their product breakdown shows that the majority of their revenue comes from consumables, meaning these sales are almost recurring in nature as customers will keep coming back if satisfied with their disposable instruments, gloves, and glass slides.With more than $20 billion in revenue in 2017, TMO has four distinct reporting segments: Laboratory Products and Services (37% revenue); Life Sciences and Solutions (25%); Analytical Instruments (22%); and Specialty Diagnostics (16%).SourceAlthough this article series is primarily about drug manufacturing (which is part of TMO's Laboratory Products and Services segment), to fully understand the company and therefore, figure out if it is worth a spot in a portfolio now, we first have to dig a little into each segment.This segment produces a wide range of diagnostic tools used in the laboratories of healthcare, pharmaceutical, industrial, and food safety companies. These products include diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, and instruments used to increase the accuracy and speed of diagnoses and therefore, improve patient care. As a medical student, I understand the huge importance of diagnostic tools in patient care. As they say, ""time is money,"" but in the healthcare sector, time is money and better patient outcomes, and therefore, correct timely diagnoses are a must.SourceAs the above graphic from a 2017 TMO presentation shows, consumables make up the vast majority of sales which is good news as the rising demand for diagnostic tools will help boost recurring sales. Even better is the 27% operating margin that the segment has, meaning more revenue is falling straight to the profit line.This segment provides instruments, consumables, software, and services to a range of customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, government, environmental, and other research and industrial markets. These include mass spectrometers, mineral analysis instruments, and radiation measurement devices as well as database and analysis tools to further enhance results.SourceThe standout here is the 40% of revenue that comes from the Asia-Pacific region, making a slightly more rounded geographical breakdown. But as is to be expected in this segment, one-off instrument sales make up the majority of revenue, being sales of large analytical machines. The 20% operating margin is once again a good sign of good sector economics as well as managerial discipline and execution.The segment offers a large range of instruments, reagents, and consumables that are used in medical and biological research, and the discovery and production of drugs and vaccines. Without boring you with what these products are and do, I can dive into my past experiences in a research laboratory while researching and writing my thesis back during my undergraduate degree. These products are absolutely essential to medical, genetic, and other bioscientific research. Though I'd never thought about where all the laboratory materials were coming from, I can now understand the great business behind the unending need for all the things a medical or bioscience researcher constantly uses.SourceThis can be seen in the above graph, where 83% of sales in this segment were consumables leading to a very impressive 30% operating margin. Revenue is also geographically and sector diverse. Another positive is the strong growth in Asia-Pacific sales as well as the ability to now order products online, making the buying process easier for customers. And to top it off is the 7% organic growth rate, which is the highest of all four of the company's segments.This is the segment that will catch our eye as we look for ways to invest in the contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) industry. TMO entered this space with a splash in August 2017 with the closure of the acquisition of Patheon for $7.2 billion, bringing a leading CDMO player under the Thermo Fisher umbrella and thus, strengthening TMO's value proposition to current and prospective biopharma customers.SourceThe above slides are from a TMO presentation and summarise the CDMO market and the opportunities Patheon can deliver on. Thermo Fisher's decisive move into this important and growing industry may prove to be prescient, as the market is fragmented enough for consolidation by big players. As shown above, Patheon is able to deliver in all three major business sectors of the CDMO market as well as in two major geographies. However, the acquisition did not come cheap, with TMO paying approximately 22x Patheon's operating earnings. But with synergies and further growth expected, the transaction may end up a shrewd one by TMO's management.Even before the Patheon acquisition, the Laboratory Products and Services segment was TMO's largest with $6.7 billion in revenue in 2016. Products include laboratory equipment (e.g. freezers, centrifuges), consumables (pipettes, vials), and chemicals, all used primarily for drug discovery and development and medical research. Services include development and manufacture of small and large molecules used in pharmaceutical products as well as clinical trial services for pharmaceutical and biotech companies.SourceThe majority of revenue for this segment (once again) is made up of recurring sales (consumables and services), growing organically at 5% and has an operating margin of 14.4%. Note that these two metrics will be slightly higher due to Patheon's integration into this segment. Though not as diverse as other segments, both in business and geography, the segment still does 35% of its sales ex-North America and with Patheon's revenues, will rely less heavily on the research and safety market channel business sector.Using TMO's 2018 guidance, we will see full-year revenue growth over 2017 numbers of 13-14% to $23.62-23.86 billion and EPS growth of 14-15% to $10.80-10.96. In the company's Q1 report, organic revenue growth was 7% (23% with acquisitions and currency gains), adjusted EPS increased 20% to $2.50, and adjusted operating margin in the first quarter dropped from 22.5% in Q1 2017 to 22% this quarter.Specialty Diagnostics segment revenue grew 9% to $0.95 billion and adjusted operating margin was down sequentially from 26.9% to 25.6%.Analytical Instruments Segment grew revenue 19% to $1.26 billion and adjusted operating margin increased to 19.6% from 18.2% in the 2017 quarter.Life Sciences Solutions segment revenue grew 10% to $1.50 billion and adjusted operating margin increased to 34.5% from 31.8%.Laboratory Products and Services segment results reflect the Patheon acquisition, where revenue grew 42% to $2.41 billion and adjusted operating margin declined from 12.7% to 11.6%.The above results are non-GAAP and were all adjusted for items the company believes are non-recurring and are outside the normal operations of the company. And though my father (an accountant by trade) would strongly advise against using these numbers, as a mere mortal in the accounting world, I will tend to defer to and trust these numbers until proven otherwise.A few metrics my father taught me to calculate when deciding on the quality of a company are the return on equity (ROE), net debt to equity ratio, and the amount of goodwill from the equity (if relevant). And then to value a company, we'll look at the PE ratio as well as the price/cash flow ratio.To calculate the approximate ROE, we take the adjusted net income for Q1 of $1.012 billion and divide it by the company's total shareholder's equity of $26.123 billion minus $0.95 billion of cash. We then multiply this number by 4 to approximate 4 quarters worth of net income:(1.012 x 4)/(26.123-0.95) = 4.048/25.173 = 16.1%An ROE of ~16% is pretty good, but below the higher numbers top quality companies show.For net debt to equity, we take the total long-term debt of $18.122 billion minus cash of $0.95 billion and divide it by equity of $26.123 billion:(18.122-0.95)/26.123 = 17.172/26.123 = 65.74%This is quite a high debt load, but TMO will get the benefit of the doubt here due to its ability to produce large amounts of cash and therefore, pay interest as well as reduce its debt. Looking at when the debt is due, the majority is evenly spread out over the next decade, so at least the banks won't be knocking on the door all at once in the near future. A quarterly interest expense of $163 million from $1 billion in net income doesn't really rock the boat here either.However, when we come to looking at goodwill, we see that TMO holds $25.362 billion of goodwill on $56.58 billion in assets or 44.8%. That is a large amount of intangible assets, though understandable with TMO's modus operandi of acquisition-reliant growth. But this is still something to keep an eye on, in case an acquisition is written down, and therefore, the debt to equity would grow. But otherwise, goodwill seems to be amortised in a timely manner and not spread out over more years than normal (ala GE).Using the outlook for 2018 of a minimum EPS of $10.80, we get a forward PE of 20x and a forward price/cash flow of 22x (using the last closing price of $217.41)For those of you asking, ""what about the dividend?"" I'm going to have to disappoint you. TMO does pay a dividend, but at a paltry $0.17 in the last quarter, we're looking at a full-year yield of 0.3%. This is not a stock for the average dividend growth investor.SourceSo, is Thermo Fisher a wonderful company selling at a fair price, or a fair company selling at a wonderful price? After researching its business, segments, financials, and valuation, I think TMO falls near the 'wonderful company, fair price' designation. Growing at 14-15% this year at a PE of 20x, TMO seems fairly priced. However, the high-ish debt the company has, as well as its high levels of goodwill as a percentage of assets, makes me pause and thus, I would like to see more of a margin of safety in the share price before making any buys, especially in this bull market. The margin of safety will be different for all of us depending on our risk profiles, though as I've said before, it will pay to be more cautious than normal in this market environment. But TMO will definitely be on my watchlist from now on, who wouldn't want a life sciences behemoth in their portfolio?For CDMO-minded investors, it would be prudent to be mindful that services and products for the drug manufacturing industry only account for about 35-40% of TMO's revenue. However, as the industry grows, TMO continues to be one of the major players and therefore, benefit from this growth as well as the synergies it plans to extract from cross-selling between its large suite of life sciences products and its CDMO capabilities.I hope this article was helpful in making a decision as to whether Thermo Fisher is worth a spot in your portfolio or watchlist.

Do the shares deserve this premium in light of what else can be purchased? In my view, the answer is a resounding NO and I outline my thinking below. I'll look at how well (or poorly) shareholders are being treated, and I'll model a future return based on the dividend. For people who can't stand the suspense, or my writing, I think shareholders could do better. Owners should strongly consider taking profits and those who are considering this name should avoid it.The FinancialsRevenue has grown at a CAGR of about 7.8% and net income at a CAGR of ~10% since 2010. This is an acceptable rate of growth from the lows of the great recession, but there are certainly better growth profiles out there. The most troubling aspect of the financials is the fact that the company has issued about $4 billion of new debt and issued about $3.5 million of new shares over the past three years. In return, investors have received no dividend increases.Turning to the capital structure, there's an obviously a fair bit of long-term debt, which is troublesome, but the most worrying aspect of it in my view is its short-term duration. About 25% of this debt is due by 2019, and 7.5% due this year. This is the exact opposite of what I like to see. If a company has to have a long-term debt-to-equity ratio in the neighborhood of 71%, I prefer to see that debt due many years into the future, so I can, in a sense, put it out of my mind. The debt here is quite present, which presents the risk of a hit to the capital structure and, eventually, the income statement. There may not be a huge risk of an imminent credit freeze, but it is something long term investors should be aware of.Modeling The PriceI want to give the stock the benefit of the doubt and suggest that management start to grow the dividend somewhat. I'll assume a rate of growth of 2%. For those who suggest that this is too conservative, please remember that the company hasn't raised its dividend at all in five years. Holding all else constant, the resulting total return of just over 10% (or about 2.5% a year) from these levels is not excellent in light of the alternatives available (see our article on Foot Locker).The StockThe more you pay for an investment, the lower your subsequent returns are going to be. Period. This is such a tautology that it's sometimes mildly embarrassing having to repeat it, but it's true. Stocks are no more and no less than the claim to a stream of future cash flows delivered into the hands of their owners. It's very easy to overpay for this annuity, and when you do that, you've put yourself in a situation where you may as well be burning money. It's for that reason that valuation is the single most important determinant in deciding what to buy. Sometimes paying a premium is alright if the company is expected to deliver above average results, but for a company that has a flat dividend policy, absolutely not.Another way to view this is by looking at the relationship between forward and current P/E multiples. By holding all else constant, it's possible to gauge the level of optimism the market is currently expressing here. At the moment, the forward P/E multiple is about 19 and the current PE multiple is about 31. Holding all else constant, then, the market is forecasting earnings growth of 63% over the next year. There may be growth - that's the rationale for the premium price - but a growth rate north of 60% is way too optimistic in my view.Technical SnapshotAs per our ChartMasterPro Daily Model the trend for TMO turned Bearish with the daily close below $158.00. From here, we see the stock dropping to the $148.00 over the next three months.Today, we bought the TMO 16JUN17 160 Put Options, which will provide us with approximately 11x leverage on our short trade. Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close above $160.00.For investors in the shares, we recommend that you sell to avoid any further decline in the share price.CMPro PortfolioBelow is the directional allocation for our trading portfolio. We allocate 3% of the portfolio to each option trade.ConclusionIn my view, investors would be wise to take their gains with this company and move on. If someone is considering purchasing the shares, they should wait until the shares reach a more reasonable valuation."

TMO is rated 4/5 stars on StockFlare.Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO), the parent company of Nalgene and over 200 other successful subsidiaries/brands is a strong buy due to optimistic analysts, future growth and value all in one package. Nalgene, a niche container originally designed as labware for packaging/containment that has become a consumer product only accounts for a small fraction of TMO. The company was founded in 2006 by a merger of Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific and since then has made notable acquisitions of Phadia, Life Sciences and recently Patheon. Its mission is ""to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.""Past GrowthIn its 11 years of existence, TMO has seen some very strong growth. In that time frame, they doubled their revenue from $9 billion to $18 billion, grew GAAP earnings per share 13% on a compound annual basis, deployed $30 billion on complementary acquisitions and returned $8 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Notably, its 5-year return according to Morningstar is almost 30%, compared to the S&P 500 return of 16% and its YTD return is 25% compared to the S&P 500 return of about 10%.

Even low estimates state that TMO will grow past $200 in the coming months. In addition, the stock has beat estimated EPS for the past four quarters.The main driver of TMO's stellar growth over the past 10 years is the sheer size of the company. In the introduction of this article, we quickly stated that TMO has over 200 subsidiaries. This is no small fact, and allows Thermo-Fisher to be in industry leader in every sector it operates in. ""Thermo Fisher Scientific is the world leader in serving science, generating $18 billion in annual revenue. Customers worldwide trust the tools and solutions available through our premier brands to help them accelerate innovation and enhance productivity,"" states Marc Caspar, CEO.TMO Mergers and Acquisitions. (Sourced from Wikipedia, click here for the full size.)Below we list the sectors in which TMO operates with what (notable) subsidiaries/brands/companies:Popular product lines under the Thermo-Fisher brand are CEDIA, CellInsight, Dionex, FastDigest, HyPerforma, Nalgene, NanoDrop, Niton, Nunc, Oxoid, Phadia, Phusion, Pierce, Remel, and Sorvall. For a comprehensive list of TMO brands, products and companies click here. The wide range of subsidiaries and brands owned and operated by Thermo Fisher fuel its past, and will continue to provide for massive future growth.TMO Products, Markets, RegionsPrimary competitors to TMO include Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX), Baxter (NYSE:BAX), and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT).Future GrowthLike past growth, future growth is sure to be fueled by existing subsidiaries and upcoming mergers and acquisitions. According to the above slide from a TMO investor presentation, the company expects a 6-9% growth of operating income and a ROIC of 12-13% by 2019. EPS is expected to grow from 2016's $8.12 to $11.30-12.20 by 2019, and has beat analyst expectations for the past four quarters. The company also expects to deploy $17B of capital; 70% will go to bolt on M&As and 30% to buybacks and dividends.That 70% of capital (over $11B) allocated for acquisitions is already being put to good use. In May, TMO announced that it will acquire Patheon (NYSE:PTHN) in a deal worth $7.2B, sending PTHN jumping 33% at opening bell. Patheon is a Dutch company that manufactures and develops drug ingredients, and is the leader in the CDMO market. Its acquisition will allow TMO to enter the CDMO market while strengthening its position in the Laboratory Products and Solutions sector. The Pantheon deal is expected to be immediately profitable and add 30 cents per share in the first full year after the completion of the deal. In addition in the third year after the PTHN acquisition, total synergies of $120 million should be produced. The deal should be completed by the end of 2017.The PTHN deal is only one of many past and future acquisitions of Thermo Fisher. With a remaining $4B for acquisitions, TMO has a lot more acquisition potential left. The PTHN acquisition as well as past and future acquisitions provide a nice groundwork for massive future growth. If they keep up the pattern of acquiring a large/medium company that allows them to grow every two years, the company is sure to succeed in the future.In addition to acquisitions, Thermo Fisher also makes licensing deals and partnerships with other companies to secure footholds in other regions/markets. A recent example would be Thermo Fisher Scientific and Swiss company Biognosys signing a comarketing agreement this week for Thermo Fisher's Orbitrap mass spectrometers and Biognosys' Spectronaut Pulsar software. As part of the agreement, the two companies will further develop and optimize DIA-related workflows, allowing TMO to expand into the DIA market in the future. Other notable partnerships/deals that Thermo-fisher is involved in include a partnership with CDC for software development and a partnership with West China Hospital for research, development and expansion into China.Also, while Thermo Fisher stock isn't known for capital return, they do offer shareholders a small 0.34% yield with a low payout ratio of 6.5%FAST Graphs estimates the yield to increase to 0.8% by 2026. In the second quarter of 2016, the company board also authorized the repurchase of $1.5 billion of shares of the company's common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. The new repurchase authorization has no expiration date, and succeeds the previous repurchase which was completed in Q1 2016.Analyst Opinions/PredictionsBecause of this stellar past growth and great potential for future growth, analysts think highly of this stock. According to Yahoo! Finance, 18/20 analysts state 'buy' or 'strong buy'. The stock is the recipient of many research reports; Morgan Stanley boosted their price target on Thermo Fisher Scientific from $186.00 to $192.00 and gave the company an ""overweight"" rating in a research note on Friday, April 28th. Deutsche Bank AG upped their price objective on Thermo Fisher Scientific from $163.00 to $188.00 and gave the company a ""buy"" rating in a research note on Friday, April 28th. Next year earnings are expected to enter the $20B range, and grow 5%. According to the FAST Graph, we could see $12.26 EPS by 2020.Recommendation Trends, via Yahoo! FinanceOut of 17 analysts, the consensus price target is $185.41, about $10 more than trading price today. The high is $200 and the low is $155.For investors looking for exposure to TMO without directly investing in the stock, multiple ETFs have them as a top holding. iShares Dow Jones US Medical Dev., (NYSEARCA:IHI) has 7.6% of its total holdings in TMO. Notably, IHI is one of the largest US medical device ETFs and tracks the Dow Jones US Select Medical Equipment Index.

3979460,101862,2016-06-02T13:07:57-04:00,"Billionaire hedge fund manager Larry Robbins spoke about the future of hedge funds in an interview with Capitalize for Kids.In the interview, Robbins pitched HCA, MCK, and TMO.The full interview is a part of volume one of the Capitalize for Kids Investor Series.","Billionaire hedge fund manager Larry Robbins spoke about the future of hedge funds and pitched HCA Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) in an exclusive interview with Capitalize for Kids. CAPITALIZE FOR KIDS: Can you walk us through how you started, and how the firm has been able to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns since inception?LARRY ROBBINS: Glenview started because when I worked at Omega for Leon Cooperman, I had the same need to invest personally as many of our clients. I was personally looking to invest in a way that would have low risk over time, that would provide real returns over time, and that would allow me to focus my own capital on that which was known and knowable - from a fundamental perspective.I think one of the challenges that many people have is that, in their pursuit of highly diversified investment strategies, they end up investing their own capital - or capital that they are the fiduciary for - on things that, due to time constraints, they have no contact with. Or of which they don't have a capacity to develop a deep understanding. The theory, when we started Glenview - and that perpetuates today - is to invest in businesses that we believe we can adequately describe in a matter of minutes.Businesses where we can look at past and present fundamentals and try to predict future fundamentals - including future earnings growth, cash flow growth, shareholder returns, and where we can invest capital at valuations - absolute valuations - that we find reasonable. And the final thing is that, all along the way, we wanted to think and act like owners - which the business has allowed us to do.CAPITALIZE FOR KIDS: Glenview launched a sidecar fund in Q4 last year to take advantage of the recent market dislocation. Can you talk about what that sidecar fund is and why you decided to offer it to your partners?LARRY ROBBINS: It's no secret. Hedge fund performance in general, and Glenview's performance in particular, has been negative over the last six months [as of March 2016]. And it's been negative for reasons that we believe are transitory rather than perpetual. We therefore believe that the forward opportunity set is greatly enhanced, and that clients will be best served by allocating more capital - rather than less - towards that market opportunity. Notwithstanding, we also understand that there is a viewpoint that, of course, an investment manager who works for fees is going to say that - because the manager gets paid more to have you give them more money.In order to maximally assist our clients in making the right decision - as well as to further and deepen our alignment with our clients - we felt that it was fair and appropriate for us to be able to manage an additional amount of capital above and beyond what we managed for them. In doing this, we would receive zero benefit, we would charge zero fees, and we would invest in securities that were highly liquid, so that they did not crowd out any opportunity for our core funds, our core fee-paying clients.We offered this as an option - but not a requirement - to all of our clients, so that they could benefit from the dislocation between fundamental values and trading values that occurred prior to the middle of November. In that spirit, we launched the sidecar product, which is long only - which only invests in $10 billion and up securities - and that augments the holdings that we have in our Glenview and Glenview Opportunity funds.The product was extremely well received. It was fully subscribed: we contemplated three closings, as it was fully subscribed after the first two. The product has delivered alpha. I'm going to stop short of quoting performance statistics because I don't want to get in trouble with my compliance officer, but it has delivered alpha. We believe that it will deliver value to our clients over time - above and beyond that which we believe we deliver in the core products.We are extremely frustrated any time our funds have a drawdown. We try to do everything we can to put investors back into a position where the capital balances are restored, and then augmented. But while investors wait, we thought that it was fair and appropriate for us to offer this additional product so that investors could benefit from the volatility that we saw in the marketplace, rather than simply suffer from it.The unfortunate truth of our business is we're trying to do something that's very hard, and very unnatural. We were created in order to take advantage of market anomalies, and yet we are also expected to prevent market anomalies from negatively impacting capital balances. I'm not complaining about that dichotomy. We're not crying about it, but we do recognize that there's a natural tension between the times that opportunity sets are created and the times that the opportunity sets are harvested. And it is likely, over decades, that occasionally opportunity starts to get created on your watch while you're holding that security.In order to encourage opportunistic investor behavior, I think you're accurate in saying that we will go to great lengths to encourage opportunistic investor behavior - because we want to make sure that the clients know that we will do anything we can to support their objectives. At the same time, our firm has greatly benefited from the long-term commitment our clients have shown to us by giving us the honor of managing money for them over more than a decade-and-a-half. We absolutely believe that the hedge fund industry has not only a right to earn fees when it delivers value, but a responsibility to deliver value - and we are happy to find any opportunities that allow us to do that.CAPITALIZE FOR KIDS: As you're a past conference speaker, this is a unique opportunity to follow up with you on a previously presented investment idea. Based on Glenview's public filings, you continue to have a material position in Thermo Fisher Scientific. Can you give us an update on that position?LARRY ROBBINS: Thermo Fisher is an example of a company, which is well-run and well-managed - from top to bottom. So much of the popular press talks about hedge funds engaging underperforming companies, or entrenched managements, or dysfunctional boards. And yet, if you look at Thermo Fisher Scientific which is the aggregation of four different companies: Thermo Electron, Fisher Scientific, and Life Technologies - itself two different companies, it's an example of a board and management operating on all cylinders.Number one, their business continues to exhibit the defensive growth characteristics that attracted us to want to invest in the life sciences industry. In the fourth quarter of 2015, they posted their strongest organic revenue growth quarter in five years, posting seven percent organic revenue growth. For a firm like ours, whose average portfolio earnings multiple is 12 times this year's and 10 times next year's earnings, it's hard to find businesses that grow organically more than seven percent, so certainly we're gratified that the business does that.Thermo has allocated capital extremely well. They repurchased shares and made meaningful acquisitions - the most significant of which in the last several years was their acquisition of Life Technologies, which was also a Glenview holding. At the time we pitched Thermo to your conference [October 2014], our thesis was that Thermo's organic revenue growth would accelerate not only because Life Technologies was a financially accretive tuck-in that offered significant cost savings, but because the platform that Life Technologies owned would actually accelerate organic revenue growth.That certainly has come to pass in 2015, and is reflected in increased optimism with respect to organic revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. Finally, Thermo is an example of what we would call the 'wash-rinse-repeat trade'. There is much discussion in the market of companies that either employ financial engineering or have a too-great reliance on leverage in order to drive financial returns.And yet Thermo, as an investment grade company, has developed enormous credibility with the credit markets and with the rating agencies, as well as with its shareholders, by identifying attractive acquisition candidates and financing them mostly with debt securities - but then using their prodigious free cash flow and the underlying EBITDA growth of the combined company in order to have the balance sheet self-repair over an 18 to 24 month period.As we sit here today, Thermo has de-levered to below three times debt to EBITDA, which puts them in a position in 2016 to again be a significant capital deployer. To date, they have bought back $500 million of stock and have announced the accretive acquisition of Affymetrix. We believe that the company has additional firepower to augment their strong organic top line growth - and a strong margin expansion with additional accretive repurchases or M&A that'll further shareholder returns.Thermo's earnings growth has not been as strong as we would have liked because they have experienced currency headwinds. Approximately, 30 percent of their business is in Europe, so they had headwinds from the Euro. As a hedge fund, we have maintained a short position in the Euro for the last three years, in part to compensate us for the implicit net long exposure that Thermo and others of our portfolio companies have through the geographic dispersion of their business.Having said that, what we've observed in the market place is that companies have actually been penalized in terms of multiple compression for currency headwinds that most likely are transitory - or at least they seem to be transitory, looking at it in an unbiased manner. While we would've liked to have seen Thermo grow faster (and it did have to absorb the currency headwinds), we nonetheless are gratified that the company can continue to put up attractive growth, both constant currency and reported. And, as a hedge fund, we've had a tool at our disposal with which to compensate our investors for currency movements - and other risks that come up - that may have been detractors to our overall performance.For more insights on Thermo Fisher and McKesson Corporation and HCA Holdings , sign up and download the full interview with Larry Robbins."
4074938,25120,2017-05-19T17:45:26-04:00,"Thermo Fisher makes another sizable move with the $7.2 billion acquisition of Patheon.The deal makes sense, driven by costs and tax synergies, and prospects for improved services to clients.While leverage is on the high side, Thermo has great capabilities to deleverage amidst continued growth, a low dividend payout and large amortization charges which support cash flow.Recognizing the quality of the company and its management in making these deals, I will be a buyer if shares revisit the $140-150 range.","Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) strikes again. The company is making a big move into the market for aiding drug development with the $7.2 billion acquisition of Patheon (NYSE:PTHN).For investors in Patheon, which has only been public since last summer, the $35 buyout offer marks a decent 40% premium over the IPO price. With the purchase, Thermo Fisher has laid out more than $35 billion in dealmaking in the past six or seven years, as investors continue to approve the dealmaking strategy. Solid organic growth, rapid deleveraging and realization of synergies have resulted in shares having tripled since the Thermo Fisher merger closed a decade ago.While I greatly applaud these achievements by management, I remain somewhat cautious on the back of high GAAP multiples and usage of leverage, although cash flow generation and organic growth remain very impressive by all means. Shares can hardly be called very cheap, but we have to recognize the quality of the business, which makes that I will revisit my neutral stance in the $140-150 region.Adding PatheonThermo Fisher is buying Patheon in a $7.2 billion deal which includes a net debt component of roughly $2 billion.Patheon provides extensive and customizable solutions for all kinds of biopharmaceutical companies to meet their complex development as well as manufacturing needs. This so-called CDMO (Contract Development & Manufacturing Organization) market measures $40 billion a year. Patheon holds nearly 5% of this very fragmented market as its sales came in at nearly $1.9 billion in 2016.The company is active in all three segments of the CDMO market: development services, active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing as well as finished dosage form manufacturing.The company is mainly active in North America (two-third of sales) and Europe and will become part of TMO's Laboratory Product Services Segment. The deal gives TMO a big entry into the growing CDMO market which is still fragmented and grows at percentages in the high single digits. TMO will furthermore add complementary services with the addition of Patheon on top of its own competencies in research support, aid in clinical trials and production. Offering its clients a more complete set of solutions, TMO aims to gain more share in the market.The company claims that the deal will boost adjusted earnings by $0.30 per share in year one after closure. Synergies are seen at $120 million by year three. Roughly three quarter of these synergies are expected to be realized on the cost side, as tax synergies have been mentioned but have not been quantified. The remaining $30 million in synergies are expected from the profit contribution of accelerating revenue growth.An M&A BoomSince 2010, TMO has laid out over $29 billion to buy some 50 companies as this deal increases the bill to $36 billion. Key deals include the deal of FEI which took place a year ago. This deal followed other high-profile deals including the purchase of Affymetrix, Phadia and Life Technologies, among others.Following the merger between Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific in 2006, which created a $10 billion giant in terms of sales, revenues have doubled ever since. TMO has effectively managed to grow sales by combining organic growth and savvy dealmaking. The quality of this growth has been decent as well, as margins have only trended up over time.The $7.2 billion increase in net debt will put another strain on the balance sheet which already revealed a net debt load of more than $16 billion at the end of the first quarter. Current net debt is seen at roughly $23.5 billion. Fortunately this is supported by real operational momentum.Alongside the release of the first-quarter results, the company hiked the full-year guidance. Revenues are seen at $19.6 billion this year, which means that this pro-forma number will jump towards >$21.5 billion with the addition of Patheon. This follows a solid start to 2017, with organic growth coming in at 4% in Q1.The company guided for 2017 adjusted earnings of $9.20 per share at the midpoint of the range. That translates into expected adjusted earnings of $3.6 billion. Note that GAAP earnings amounted to just 67% of reported adjusted earnings in Q1 with the difference being largely driven by non-cash impairment charges.The company posted adjusted operating earnings of $1.08 billion in Q1, a number which excluded $367 million in amortization charges. Given that D&A ran at $464 million, the regular depreciation charges came in at $97 million. Annualizing the first-quarter earnings and applying a 10% premium, as the full-year adjusted earnings guidance represented 440% of Q1 adjusted earnings, shows that adjusted EBITDA for the year might come in at $5.2 billion.Patheon posted $395 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2016 for a pro-forma EBITDA number of $5.6 billion. With TMO's net debt standing at $23.5 billion, leverage ratios come in at 4.2 times.Based on the numbers, adjusted operating earnings come in at $4.5 billion for the core business alone, and close to $3.1 billion if we account for impairment charges. Adding $220 million in adjusted operating earnings from Patheon, I fail to see real accretion in the near term. TMO currently pays just half a billion in interest on its debt for a roughly 3% cost of financing. If we assume that the company can continue to borrow at these rates, incremental financing charges of roughly $210 million will largely offset the added adjusted earnings.As TMO guides for $0.30 per share accretion, with nearly 400 million shares outstanding, the after-tax earnings contribution is seen at $120 million. This probably means that TMO expects to see some real synergies in year one, as Patheon guided for a strong 2017 already.If we factor in this guided accretion and further synergies down the road, the company might be able to deliver on adjusted earnings of $10 per share in 2018. That suggests that shares trade at 17 times adjusted earnings, as GAAP multiples are much higher as a result of structural and high amortization charges.Final ThoughtsIt has been a year ago since I last looked as the prospects for the company following the acquisition of FEI. Shares traded around $150 at the time, which valued the company at 27 times GAAP earnings, while TMO operated with four times leverage. Even as non-cash amortization charges allow for a quick pace of deleveraging and the outlook for the business was rosy, I called the valuation steep.The overall run higher in the market, further growth of TMO, steady path of deleveraging and solid long-term prospects made that shares have been trading higher to current levels of $170 per share. On the back of solid 4% organic growth, a strong track record of the management team, as well as sound future prospects, investors remain upbeat.The company guides for $120 million in synergies on a pre-tax basis from the Patheon deal. The aggressive accounting makes that TMO's effective tax rate is very close to zero, which makes that pre-tax synergies really make a bit dent on the bottom line. Those synergies, if capitalized at a 20 times multiple, represent value of roughly $2 billion. This supports the steep premium which TMO paid for Patheon, amounting to roughly $1.3 billion in real dollar terms.I really like the underlying business, its strong management team and rosy prospects. I do not like the aggressive usage of leverage as well as accounting/tax rules, but as long as it can be maintained, it provides some sort of competitive advantage, certainly the lower tax rate. TMO remains a play on growth, and the size and diversity of the business really create diversification within the company.With cash flow generation (ex-dealmaking) closely mimicking non-GAAP earnings, the company has the potential to deleverage rather quickly amidst realization of further synergies and continued organic growth. If shares revisit the January lows of $140, I am willing to reconsider my neutral stance in what continues to be an excellent long-term play."

In the short term I believe they are slightly overvalued. Put Fisher Scientific on your watchlist and watch closely for a potential entry point.About The CompanyThermo Fisher Scientific is the premier supplier of analytical instruments, equipment, consumables, software, and services to the scientific industry. Their products are used in research, manufacturing, analysis, discovery, and diagnostics. Their business is split into four segments. These are Life Science Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Services. A breakdown of the business is shown in Figure 1.Figure 1: Thermo Fisher Segment BreakdownSource: Baird Industrial Conference PresentationWhat I LikeFisher has a diverse customer base which reduces sector risk. Their revenue is made up primarily by consumables although Instruments and Services should not be discounted. They has an emerging markets but it could be stronger. This is shown in Figure 2.Figure 2: Fisher Scientific DiversitySource: Baird Industrial ConferenceFisher has displayed an adj. EPS CAGR of 16% from 2006 through 2015. They have consistently beat earnings have effectively deployed capital. They have made several strategic acquisitions over the past five years, bought back over 78 million shares, and began paying a dividend in 2012. Currently M&A is their main method of deploying capital. Their guidance is to expect 60-75% of their deployed capital to go towards M&A while 25-40% would be returned to shareholders. Should this strategy change their payout ratio remains low at roughly 12% which means their dividend has room to grow. They have displayed excellent top and bottom line growth as shown in Figures 3 and 4. So if this all looks good, what's not to like?Figure 3: Fisher Revenue and Adj. EBITDA GrowthSource: Fisher Q4 2016 PresentationFigure 4: Fisher EPS GrowthSource: Fisher Q4 2016 PresentationWhere They Can ImproveFisher has more debt than I would like. Their debt/equity ratio comes in at 77%. They do show signs of paying it down and Moody's gives them a credit rating of Baa3 for unsecured debt which is fairly safe. Next is their earnings growth. Over five years it is an impressive 14% but recently it has slowed down. Year over year it is just 3.44%. I do not believe this level of growth justifies a P/E of 30. Earnings track record is shown in Figure 5.Figure 5: Fisher Earnings GrowthSource: Trademonster Fundamental ReportOpportunity and StrategyI am looking for Fisher to do one or more things before I take a position in them. I would like to see them pay down their debt. I would like to see them increase their dividend. Finally, I would like to see a P/E around 20 whether that is due to increased earnings or decreased price (assuming nothing fundamentally changes). I believe they are a safe and stable long term play. A logarithmic graph of their entire price history shown below displays near continual positive growth.Figure 6: Fisher Log ChartTMO data by YChartsFinal ThoughtsI think Thermo Fisher Scientific is a safe long term play. They may be a tad on the expensive side at current prices but they are most certainly on my watch list. I will be carefully monitoring their earnings reports and listening in to calls for information that would suggest faster growth than we are seeing. I would like an increased dividend to boot so I could feel less guilty about adding them to my retirement portfolio."
3960264,21877,2016-03-22T14:24:28-04:00,,"Bigger is not always better. Affymetrix (NASDAQ:AFFX) still seems to be determined to be part of Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO), sticking with its $1.3bn takeover bid in spite of a higher offer by Origin Technologies. Doubts about Origin, controlled by some former Affymetrix employees, include that it hopes to fund the $1.5bn purchase with debt from a Chinese private equity firm and that it “appears to be a newly formed shell entity with no assets of which Affymetrix is aware”, according to Affymetrix.A shareholder vote is scheduled this week, and Affymetrix's management must hope that investors take a similarly long-term view rather than just grabbing the cash. The group’s share price rose 14% on Friday when Origin made its bid, but it was down 10% in morning trading today on news of the rejection.It is theoretically possible for shareholders now to go against managment and refuse to approve Thermo's bid, especially if they are attracted merely by the prospect of more cash. Still, in pushing for Thermo, Affymetrix management must have taken the view of the biggest funds, so such a scenario seems unlikely.Potential buyersBut if it does arise then other buyers would be expected to take an interest in Affymetrix, a group that provides genetic tests used in various applications including drug development – this makes it conceivable that suitors could come from the pharma sector. Roche springs to mind: it tried and failed to acquire another genetic testing specialist, Illumina, in 2012.Illumina itself could be another bidder – since Roche’s offer, rumoured to be worth up to $8bn, its market cap has grown to around $22bn, and it has cash to spend.One area of overlap between Affymetrix, Roche and Illumina is noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), a method of diagnosing foetal genetic abnormalities that is seeing increasing interest. Affymetrix’s NIPT offering could tempt a diagnostic company that is not currently active in the space, like Danaher or Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) – the latter just spun out its respiratory unit to focus on diagnostics (BD spin-out points to more private equity in medtech, March 11, 2016).PerkinElmer, another diagnostics tools provider, bought Swedish NIPT specialist Vanadis in January, but it might be interested in Affymetrix’s other assets.One group that looks unlikely to be in the frame is Abbott, which is currently acquiring Alere (Abbott pays $5.8bn to climb the diagnostics rankings, February 1, 2016). The transaction has been delayed, however, after Alere postponed the filing of its annual report and disclosed a US subpoena over its sales practices in Africa, Latin America and China.Analysts do not seem to think that the developments are deal killers, but if it does fall through then Abbott could be shopping again.Going up?Should a bidding war emerge Thermo would be forced to increase its bid from the original figure of $14 per share. It could afford to go up to $16.50 per share without materially eroding the return on invested capital, according to Leerink analysts.Even at the original cost Affymetrix was pricey, at around 25 times trailing Ebitda, and synergies were the key to making it pay (Thermo kicks off 2016’s medtech megamergers, January 11, 2016).The Leerink analysts note that while a $16.50 per share bid represents a premium of 30 times trailing Ebitda, the targeted $70m of synergies by the third year after the deal closes “effectively doubles Affymetrix’s Ebitda. Thus, the purchase price will ultimately look closer to 11 times Ebitda.”The leaders of both Affymetrix and Thermo Fisher, however, will be happiest if the situation remains exactly where it is at the moment.

3351275,51072,2015-07-24T14:46:41-04:00,"Many institutional and retail investors have used legacy credit ratings for so long that the use of modern default probabilities for portfolio selection is new to them.We present a case study of how default probabilities are used to make ""yes"" or ""no"" decision for a given potential bond issuer, in our case Thermo Fisher Scientific.We show that the company ranks among the safest 5% of its peers in default risk but has wide credit spreads. Its bonds rank 1st and 2nd by ""best value"".","Many fixed-income investors, both institutional and retail, have relied on legacy ratings for such a long time that the use of default probabilities, instead of ratings, is a new concept for them. How are default probabilities used in portfolio selection and construction? There are many facets to the answer to that question. In this note, we ask a simple question: how do we determine whether a specific bond issuer meets the ""best value"" hurdle? In other words, which bond issuers offer sufficient value that they should be added to the portfolio, as long as other constraints on risk are met? Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) offered 500 million Euros of senior notes due 2022 last week, so it's timely that we use TMO in this case study.We use default probabilities and bond market price and credit spread data to determine whether the company is a good candidate for our bond portfolio. Our analysis incorporates TMO's bond price data as of July 21, 2015. A total of 63 trades were reported on 8 fixed-rate non-call senior bond issues of Thermo Fisher Scientific with trading volume of $22 million. The company was the 96th most heavily traded fixed rate corporate bond issuer in the U.S. corporate bond market on July 21. We compare TMO's bonds to the 372 most heavily traded bond issues to finalize our assessment.Conclusion: Our use of modern reduced form default probabilities and market pricing data allow us to reach some straightforward conclusions about the bonds of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. First, the firm's bonds trade at relatively wide credit spreads that are comparable to the ""too big to fail"" banks underlying the U.S. Dollar Cost of Funds Index. Second, the firm has very low default probabilities, ranking in the safest 5% among peer group firms at all maturities and among the safest of all ""legacy investment grade"" firms. Third, the ratio of credit spread to default probabilities is very high. By this ""best value"" criterion, TMO's bonds were the best and second best of 372 heavily traded bonds on July 21. The ultimate conclusion is also simple: there is no better potential addition to a bond portfolio than Thermo Fisher Scientific.The AnalysisInstitutional investors around the world are required to prove to their audit committees, senior management, and regulators that their investments are in fact ""investment grade."" For many investors, ""investment grade"" is an internal definition; for many banks and insurance companies, ""investment grade"" is also defined by regulators. We consider whether or not a reasonable U.S. bank investor would judge Thermo Fisher Scientific to be ""investment grade"" under the June 2012 rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has announced its implementation of the Dodd-Frank rules in 2012. The default probabilities used are described in detail in the daily default probability analysis posted by Kamakura Corporation. The default probabilities are modern ""reduced form"" default probabilities. ""Reduced form"" default probabilities use all aspects of a firm's financial condition, stock price level and history, and macroeconomic factors. The default probability models used in today's analysis were derived from a data base with more than 2.2 million observations and more than 2,600 corporate failures. There are other types of default probabilities, but in very large comparative studies, the reduced form default probabilities have been consistently proven most accurate.Assuming the recovery rate in the event of default would be the same on all bond issues of the same issuer, a sophisticated investor who has moved beyond legacy ratings seeks to maximize revenue per basis point of default risk from each incremental investment, subject to risk limits on macro-factor exposure on a fully default-adjusted basis. In this note, we also analyze the maturities where the credit spread/default probability ratio is highest for TMO by looking at the firm's bonds.Term Structure of Default ProbabilitiesMaximizing the ratio of credit spread to matched-maturity default probabilities requires that default probabilities be available at a wide range of maturities. The graph below shows the current default probabilities for Thermo Fisher Scientific ranging from one month to 10 years on an annualized basis. For maturities longer than ten years, we assume that the ten-year default probability is a good estimate of default risk. The default probabilities used are the Kamakura Risk Information Services version 6.0 default probabilities, which will be officially released to clients at the end of July 2015. The current default annualized probabilities, in blue, range from 0.01% at one month to 0.01% at 1 year and 0.21% at ten years. The default probabilities that prevailed one year ago are shown in yellow. The ten-year annualized default probability for Thermo Fisher Scientific has fallen slightly since then.Summary of Recent Bond Trading ActivityThe National Association of Securities Dealers launched the TRACE (Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine) in July 2002 in order to increase price transparency in the U.S. corporate debt market. The system captures information on secondary market transactions in publicly traded securities (investment grade, high yield and convertible corporate debt) representing all over-the-counter market activity in these bonds. TMO was the 96th most heavily traded corporate bond issuer in the U.S. fixed-rate bond market on July 21. This study uses only senior non-call fixed-rate bonds. Floating rate notes, bonds with a survivor option, callable bonds, and subordinated bonds are excluded.The graph below shows 6 different yield ""curves"" that are relevant to a risk and return analysis of Thermo Fisher Scientific's bonds. These curves reflect the noise in the TRACE data, as some of the trades are small odd-lot trades. The lowest curve, in dark blue, is the yield to maturity on U.S. Treasury bonds (NASDAQ:TLT) (NYSEARCA:TBT), interpolated from the Federal Reserve H15 statistical release for that day, which exactly matches the maturity of the traded bonds of Thermo Fisher Scientific. The next curve, in the lighter blue, shows the yields that would prevail if investors shared the default probability views outlined above, assumed that recovery in the event of default would be zero, and demanded no liquidity premium above and beyond the default-adjusted risk-free yield. The orange dots graph the lowest yields reported by TRACE on that day on TMO's bonds. The green dots display the trade-weighted average yield reported by TRACE on the same day. The red dots show the maximum yield in each Thermo Fisher Scientific issue recorded by TRACE. The black dots and connecting black line show the yield consistent with the best fitting trade-weighted credit spread explained below.The graph shows a very wide ""liquidity premium"" as maturity lengthens for the bonds of TMO. We explore this premium in detail below.The high, low, average and fitted credit spreads at each maturity are graphed below for the company. We have done nothing to smooth the data reported by TRACE, which includes both large lot and small lot bond trades. For the reader's convenience, we fitted a cubic polynomial (in black) that explains the trade-weighted average spread as a trade-weighted function of years to maturity.Using default probabilities in addition to credit spreads, we can analyze the number of basis points of credit spread per basis point of default risk at each maturity. For Thermo Fisher Scientific, the credit spread to default probability ratio ranges from 5 to a very high 167 times.The credit spread to default probability ratios are shown in graphic form below for the company.Relative Value AnalysisAre these reward to risk ratios ""normal""? Are they above or below average? The best way to answer that question is to compare them to the credit spread to default probability ratios for all fixed-rate non-call senior debt issues with trading volume of more than $5 million and a maturity of at least one year on July 21. The distribution of the credit spreads on the 372 traded bonds that met these criteria on July 21 is first plotted in this histogram:The median credit spread for all 372 trades was 1.36%. The average credit spread was 2.04%. The next graph shows the wide dispersion of the credit spread to default probability ratios on those 372 July 21 trades:The median credit spread to default probability ratio on those 372 trades was 3.12 and the average was 6.47. The chart below shows the ranking of the 2 heavily traded bonds of Thermo Fisher Scientific. There were literally no bonds out of 372 large trades on July 21 that had better credit spread to default probability ratios than TMO's bonds which traded at least $5 million in volume. The company's bonds ranked 1st and 2nd of the 372 large trades on July 21.The full ranking of all heavily traded bonds is available by subscription to The Corporate Bond Investor offered by Kamakura Corporation on Seeking Alpha.Credit Default Swap AnalysisFor the week ended July 17, 2015, (the most recent week for which data is available), the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation reported zero credit default swap trades on Thermo Fisher Scientific. In fact, there has never been a single trade in the credit default swaps of TMO since the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation began weekly reporting in July 2010.Comparison with the U.S. Dollar Cost of Funds IndexThis graph compares TMO's trade-weighted average credit spreads with the U.S. Dollar Cost of Funds IndexTM on the same day. The U.S. Dollar Cost of Funds IndexTM measures the trade-weighted cost of funds for the largest deposit-taking U.S. bank holding companies. The index is a credit spread, measured in percent and updated daily, over the matched maturity U.S. Treasury yield on the same day. The current bank holding companies used in determining the index are Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). The index is an independent market-based alternative to the Libor-swap curve that has traditionally been used by many banks as an estimate of their marginal cost of funds. Kamakura Corporation is the calculation agent, and the underlying bond price data is provided by TRACE and the U.S. Department of the Treasury.The graph shows that the credit spreads for TMO are roughly the same as the composite credit spreads of the ""too big to fail"" banks in the United States. That is true even though the default probabilities for the four banks underlying the index are much higher than the default probabilities of Thermo Fisher Scientific. That is very important in the conclusions we reach below.Credit-Adjusted Dividend YieldWe explained in a recent post on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) how default probabilities and the associated credit spreads for a bond issuer can be used to calculate the credit-adjusted dividend yield on a stock. That analysis makes use of a comparison between the yield on the issuer's promise to pay $1 in the future versus the yield on a similar promise by the U.S. government to pay $1 at the same time. Using the maximum smoothness approach to both the U.S. Treasury curve and to TMO's credit spreads, we can generate the zero coupon bond yields on their promise to pay $1 in the future.If we discount dividend payments for maturities of 1 and 30 years, we can solve for the ""credit risk free"" dividend for the company. This would be the dividend level for a default risk-free issuer (we assume as a first approximation that the U.S. Treasury is default risk-free) that has the same present value as the flow of dividends from Thermo Fisher Scientific over 30 years. We use this data from SeekingAlpha.com:The history of the company's dividends is nicely summarized on the NASDAQ website.After projecting the flow of dividends from Thermo Fisher Scientific at the quarterly rate of $0.15 and using the present value factors implied by the company's bond prices, we find that the long-term credit-adjusted dividend yield is 0.406%, just 0.022% less than the traditional dividend yield of 0.428% (note that the yield on the Seeking Alpha website is different because of lags in updating the figure as the stock price changes). Both calculations assume that the dividends remain at their current level forever, except in the credit-adjusted case we recognize that Thermo Fisher Scientific may default, ending the dividend stream. The bond-based discount factors incorporate this fact. We show the calculation below for just the first 24 months of cash flows:Other AnalysisOn a cumulative basis, the current default probabilities (in blue) for Thermo Fisher Scientific range from 0.01% at 1 year to 2.11% at 10 years (down slightly from 2014, shown in yellow).The company's 1-year and 10-year default probability histories are shown in this graph. The 1-year default probability peaked at slightly over 0.20% in 2008-2009. The annualized 10-year default probability peaked at just under 0.30% at the same time. These levels are very far below the peak default probabilities of the ""too big to fail"" U.S. banks underlying the U.S. Dollar Cost of Funds Index over the same time period.As explained earlier in this note, the firm's default probabilities are estimated based on a rich combination of financial ratios, equity market inputs, and macroeconomic factors. Over a long period of time, macroeconomic factors drive the financial ratios and equity market inputs as well. If we link macro factors to the fitted default probabilities over time, we can derive the net impact of macro factors on the firm, including both their direct impact through the default probability formula and their indirect impact via changes in financial ratios and equity market inputs.The net impact of macroeconomic factors driving the historical movements in the default probabilities of Thermo Fisher Scientific have been derived using historical data beginning in January 1990. A key assumption of such analysis, like any econometric time series study, is that the business risks of the firm being studied are relatively unchanged during this period. With that caveat, the historical analysis shows that TMO's default risk responds to changes in 9 risk factors among the 28 world-wide macro factors used by the Federal Reserve in its 2015 Comprehensive Capital Assessment and Review stress testing program. These macro factors explain 74% of the variation in the default probability of Thermo Fisher Scientific. The remaining variation is the estimated idiosyncratic credit risk of the firm.TMO can be compared with its peers in the same industry sector, as defined by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and reported by Compustat. For the U.S. ""pharma and biotech"" sector, Thermo Fisher Scientific has the following percentile ranking for its default probabilities among its 478 peers at these maturities:1-month 5th percentile1-year 3rd percentile3 years 3rd percentile5 years 3rd percentile10 years 4th percentileFor all maturities, the company's default probabilities are in the safest 5% of the peer group. Taking still another view, the actual and statistically predicted Thermo Fisher Scientific credit ratings diverge slightly. The statistically predicted rating is 2 notches better than the legacy rating, those of Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Standard & Poor's (MHFI). The legacy credit ratings of Thermo Fisher Scientific have changed four times in the last decade.ConclusionsBefore reaching a final conclusion about the ""investment grade"" status of TMO, we look at more market data. First, we look at Thermo Fisher Scientific's credit spreads versus credit spreads on every bond in the ""health care-pharmaceuticals"" sector that traded on July 21:TMO's credit spreads (in black) were above peer group median levels. We now look at the matched maturity default probabilities on those traded bonds for both Thermo Fisher Scientific and the peer group:The default probabilities for the company (in black) are among the very lowest of the peer group. We note that the bonds trading heavily are generally a much better group of credits than the industry in aggregate. This is the key to our conclusions about the firm: even though its default probabilities are very low, its credit spreads are above average. We now turn to the legacy ""investment grade"" peers. First, we compare traded credit spreads on July 21, 2015:Thermo Fisher Scientific's credit spreads are again at or above the average of the investment grade peer group range. Investment grade default probabilities on a matched maturity basis for the bonds traded on July 21 are shown in this graph:The default probabilities for TMO rank among the very safest of the investment grade peer group.Our use of modern reduced form default probabilities and market pricing data allows us to reach some straightforward conclusions about the bonds of Thermo Fisher Scientific. First, the firm's bonds trade at relatively wide credit spreads that are comparable to the too-big-to-fail banks underlying the U.S. Dollar Cost of Funds Index. Second, the firm has very low default probabilities, ranking in the safest 5% among peer group firms at all maturities and among the safest of all legacy ""investment grade"" firms. Third, the ratio of credit spread to default probabilities is very high. By this ""best value"" criterion, TMO's bonds were the best and second best of 372 heavily traded bonds on July 21. The ultimate conclusion is also simple: there is no better potential addition to a bond portfolio than Thermo Fisher Scientific.Author's NoteRegular readers of these notes are aware that we generally do not list the major news headlines relevant to the firm in question. We believe that other authors on Seeking Alpha, Yahoo, at The New York Times, The Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal do a fine job of this. Our omission of those headlines is intentional. Similarly, to argue that a specific news event is more important than all other news events in the outlook for the firm is something we again believe is inappropriate for this author. Our focus is on current bond prices, credit spreads, and default probabilities, key statistics that we feel are critical for both fixed income and equity investors."
2645245,73415,2014-11-05T16:49:06-05:00,"Thermo Fisher (TMO) shares have stalled out over the past several months, but we think this is only temporary.We think the company’s acquisition of Life Technologies will allow it to participate in the genomics market.The company is diversified in the sectors and geographies it derives its revenues from.Valuation appears reasonable given its growth prospects and bright future.","Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) shares have certainly had a great run, vastly outperforming the market indices by a wide margin until earlier this year. Since then, shares have been roughly flat. Investors may be wondering if this underperformance is a sign that one of the world's largest life sciences companies is in serious trouble. We don't think so. At Main Street Wins, we believe the street is underestimating the company's future opportunities to materially increase revenue growth in fast-expanding areas such as the genomics sector and its diversity in its revenue base. Moreover, we feel that the company's valuation is rather compelling given its promising prospects.In April 2013, Thermo Fisher announced it was acquiring Life Technologies Corporation for $13.6 billion, making Thermo Fisher one of the top two companies in the field of genomics and genetic testing. We believe that this field represents a massive growth area for Thermo Fisher. According to UnitedHealth, genetic testing could grow from a $10 billion dollar industry into a $25 billion dollar opportunity by the end of the decade. It is our belief that the opportunity could be worth much more than $25 billion. Not only will genetic sequencing be used in basic science laboratories to sequence and interpret the genetic information of bacteria, plants, and viruses, but there will be implications in human healthcare as well. As an example, researchers have used genetic testing to patients with breast cancer. By characterizing the particular genetic variant of breast cancer that the patients had, researchers then customized the treatment, delivering tamoxifen (chemotherapy) only to patients who would benefit from it most. Many diseases have genetic components to them and as genetic testing becomes more ubiquitous, we believe this sector is poised to explode exponentially. While Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) currently leads in marketshare of DNA sequencing, we think this space can have multiple winners. Just as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) were winners in mobile, we think this space will have multiple winners. Moreover, Thermo Fisher is a larger company than Illumina, so it is not implausible that Thermo Fisher could devote more resources to research and development, develop superior technologies, and eventually steal marketshare.Moreover, the company is not pinning all its future successes on genomics. This company has annual pro-forma revenues of $17.1 billion, and only 26% of the company's revenues are derived from genetic sciences, biosciences, and reproduction sciences. Investors should note Thermo Fisher also is a leader in clinical assays, chromatography and mass spectrometry solutions, and several other areas. We think that even if Thermo Fisher cannot steal material share from Illumina (ILMN), it can continue to grow in other life sciences areas. Additionally, the company has planned to grow its revenues in emerging markets. In 2006, these countries represented 10% of the company's revenues, and in 2012, they represented 19% of revenues. By 2016, the company is targeting 25% of all revenues to come from the fast growing emerging markets.Lastly, we wish to comment on the company's valuation, which we believe is attractive considering the company's impressive top and bottom line growth. Shares trade at just 15.33 times forward estimates, leaving ample room for multiple expansion. On October 22, management gave guidance for 2014 revenues to be up 28% year-over-year. Shares trade at 2.99 times sales, which we also feel is reasonable given the company's wide moat and growth prospects. For income oriented investors, the company does pay a dividend that yields 0.51%. However, the company's payout ratio is only 14%, so it could easily significantly raise the dividend in years to come. The company is currently focusing on acquisitions (such as Life Technologies) and share repurchases, and we believe this is the right strategy for a growth company.We hope we have adequately outlined our bullish thesis on Thermo Fisher Scientific. The company is well-managed, diversified in its revenue sources, and strategically acquiring companies to bolster its growth. As the market begins to appreciate its strategies in emerging markets, genomics, and other areas, we think the shares will rise significantly, rewarding long-term investors."
2587725,25120,2014-10-23T09:01:29-04:00,"Thermo Fisher reports strong third quarter topline and earnings growth.Investors and analysts are disappointed with the reported growth, with the strong dollar impacting the results.I remain very cautious given the premium valuation and the significant leverage position.","Shares of Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) fell following the third quarter results, which the company released. The company reported spectacular growth driven by the acquisition of Life Technologies, although the achievements did not impress investors and analysts.While the long-term growth is impressive, it is aided big time by taking on more debt and issuing shares, thereby limiting the performance on a per share basis. Given the still premium GAAP multiples, the high leverage, lack of dividends and the multi-year momentum being witnessed, I remain very cautious at this point in time.Highlights For The QuarterThermo Fisher reported third quarter revenues of $4.17 billion, an impressive 31% increase on an annual basis. Despite the spectacular pace of growth, sales came in below consensus estimates at $4.21 billion.GAAP earnings improved by more than 48% as they rose to $471.6 million. Investors in the firm did witness quite some dilution over the past year as the number of outstanding shares rose by a tenth. This limited GAAP earnings growth to 36% as earnings rose to $1.17 per share.Adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP earnings metric, rose by 32% on a per share basis to $1.71 per share. Non-GAAP earnings came in two pennies ahead of expectations.Solid Quarter, Driven By Life TechnologiesCEO Marc Casper was happy with the topline results and excellent performance in terms of earnings as well. At the same time, Casper is happy with the progress being made with regards to the integration of Life Technologies.Thermo Fisher reports its performance across four main businesses. The life science solution business reported sales of $1.07 billion, which compares to just $167 million last year on the back of the Life Technologies acquisition which has been included for the entire quarter. Adjusted earnings nearly ten-folded as well to $306 million with adjusted margins improving by 530 basis points to 28.6% of sales.The laboratory products and service business remains the largest business although sales growth of 2% to $1.63 billion has not been very impressive. Adjusted margins have seen a bit of pressure, being down 30 basis points to 15.1% of sales.The specialty diagnostics business showed healthy organic growth of 7% with sales reaching $812 million. Margins did expand by another 70 basis points to 27.6% of sales on the back of the strong sales growth.And finally, analytical instrument sales were up by 3% to $786 million with margins seeing a 40 basis points improvement to 17.5% of sales.For the overall company, Thermo Fisher posted great gross margin expansion which rose a full five percent points to 49.0% of sales on the back of the deal of course. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose by 110 basis points to 23.4% of sales, offsetting some of those margin gains as R&D expenses rose by 120 basis points to 4.2% of sales as well.Other items had a big impact on the GAAP bottom line as well. Amortization charges of nearly $363 million, which are not included in the non-GAAP earnings metrics, totaled a whopping 8.7% of sales. At the same time, one-time benefits of $110.6 million aided the bottom line.At the same time, the company's effective tax rate of 12.9% of earnings before taxes remains low, far below statutory tax rates, as it effectively did not pay any taxes last year.The company stressed that adjusted net earnings came in much higher at $690.3 million, with net margins on that metric improving by 160 basis points to 16.5% of sales.Premium Valuation And High LeverageThermo Fisher held some $543 million in cash, equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. Following past deal making, it appears that the current debt load totals some $14.5 billion in debt, for a net debt position of about $14 billion.Based on the adjusted EBITDA of around a billion being reported over the past quarter, the net debt position is equivalent to 3.5 times annualized EBITDA which is a substantial ratio.Currently the company has some 404 million shares outstanding which at $114 per share values equity in the business at around $46 billion. Based on the extrapolation of current results, the company could post revenues of $16.8 billion going forwards, EBITDA of some $4 billion and volatile earnings numbers. GAAP earnings could come in anywhere between $1.5-$2 billion based on the current performance as non-GAAP earnings could come in as high as $3 billion.Consequently shares trade at roughly 2.7 times earnings as an enterprise valuation of roughly $60 billion implies a current EBITDA multiple of around 15 times. Earnings are very volatile, but based on GAAP profitability levels of around let's say $2 billion, shares trade around 23 times earnings.Long-Term Growth Story, Aided By Deal makingOver the past decade, Thermo Fisher has aggressively expanded its business. Sales being reported at $2.2 billion in 2004 have roughly seven-folded to more than $16.8 billion being anticipated for this year. At the same time, this growth has not really resulted in increasing margins, as the company required a lot of financial resources to pay for this kind of growth, driven by deal making in an important way.The outstanding share base rose by roughly 150% over this time period, making the performance on a per share basis less impressive. Adjusting for the dilution, revenues per share rose by a factor of three, increasing by some 11-12% per year. After the company operated with a flat net cash position a decade ago, the company has leveraged up significantly, currently carrying a big net debt position around.The growth came after Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific merged their operations back in 2006. Following numerous smaller deals, the company bought Life Technologies in a $13.6 billion deal earlier this year. This deal tag even excludes a $2.2 billion net debt position held by the firm at the time.Shareholders have loved the operational actions as shares rose from $25 in 2005 to a pre-crisis high of $60. After being cut in half during the crisis, shares have steadily risen to highs of $127 this year, after which shares have been falling some 10% ever since.In May of this year, the company last held a big investor presentation. The company stressed its global scale, premier brands, innovative capabilities and other operational achievements.The company was pleased with the initial results from the deal of Life Technologies, with synergies being ahead of plan as the company looks to reduce its net leverage target to 2.5-3.0 times EBITDA going forwards. The company stresses the very good diversification in terms of end markets, geographical areas as well as product groups.Final ThoughtsWhile the company might be able to post non-GAAP earnings close to $3 billion per year, the gap with GAAP earnings is large driven by amortization charges in particular. Of course, these costs have already been taken in the past, but a chronic appearance of these costs results in the real risks that the company might engage in ""overpaying"" for future acquisition targets in the future.The 3-4% targeted organic growth rate is solid, but I don't think we should solely rely on non-GAAP earnings. Based on this metric, shares trade at market-equivalent valuation multiples of around 16 times earnings. Furthermore, the company carries around a very substantial debt position of roughly 5 times annual non-GAAP earnings.Investors are not pleased with the short-term results given that sales growth missed as well, something, which the company blamed the strong dollar for. As a matter of fact, the recent dollar strength is forcing the company to lower the full year revenue outlook from $16.86-$16.98 billion towards $16.74-$16.82 billion.I remain very cautious as well. For starters I think that much of the past revenue performance has been driven by dilution of the shareholder base and an increase in leverage, with results after backing out these impacts being far less impressive.At the same time the company is now highly leveraged, pays a negligible dividend while the GAAP earnings multiple remains very much elevated. Even a blended approach between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings multiples yields a premium compared to the overall marketYou get the point; shares are priced to a large degree for perfection as leverage restricts the capabilities to do deals without diluting the shareholder base in the short term. The debt taken on does provide some risks in case of an unexpected slowdown although the company remains well diversified. I remain very cautious on the back of these outlined concerns."
3997330,101954,2016-08-08T14:38:53-04:00,"Thermo Fisher Scientific has shown strong revenue growth the past few fiscal years and has continued to this year.The company is aggressively executing its acquisition strategy that will most likely lead to substantial growth down the road.A recently planned, strategic acquisition should excite investors.","Thermo Fisher ScientificThermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO), which announced impressive quarterly results last Thursday, has proven to be one of the strongest performers in the healthcare sector. Falling into the advanced medical equipment and technology industry, the company provides analytical instruments, equipment, and software to aid research and discovery. It operates through four business segments, which are Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Services. In taking a closer look at the financials and fundamentals of the company as a whole, it becomes evident that this is certainly a healthy company and in a great position for future growth. Thermo Fisher Scientific's aggressive acquisition strategy has already resulted in sales growth, and we can expect to see the same over the next three years, making TMO a great pick for investors in the long run.Let's start by taking a closer look at the highlights of the quarterly results that were just released. Sales revenue increased to $4.54 billion, which is a 6% increase compared to the second quarter of 2015. We can attribute such an increase to the research and development of new products, previous acquisition deals, and the growing sales in emerging markets. Though North America still remains the strongest region for TMO, China, South Korea, and India were the leaders in emerging market growth this past quarter. With the expenses holding around the same margins from last year, the operating income margin for this past quarter ended at 14.1%. Thermo Fisher Scientific also announced a diluted EPS of $1.30. The company has now beaten earnings expectations for the two quarters of 2016. Such strong earnings announcements are great for a company that has shown solid revenue growth over the past years. A closer look at the income statement in its last annual report shows that the company's year-over-year percentage increases in revenue are greater than the year-over-year increases (or decreases) in the cost of revenue. Thus, showing that Thermo Fisher Scientific has not only done well in increasing revenue, but also in managing expenses. As an investor, such a strong income statement should be appealing for the long term.It is important to note that based off of the results of the first six months, the company has lowered its expectations for revenue to a range of $17.84 billion to $18 billion. Despite this adjustment, investors should not worry as it would still result in 5-6% growth compared to last year. The company has also raised its expectations for year-end EPS. It now predicts earnings to be between $8.07 and $8.20 a share. However, in early July, the board of Thermo Fisher Scientific approved a plan to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of shares. This news came following the company's completion of a share repurchase program during the first quarter of 2016. So yes, at first glance, it does appear to be appealing that the company is raising its EPS outlook for year-end, but it should be taken with a grain of salt because the share repurchasing programs are most likely causing the bump in expectations by affecting the EPS calculation.AcquisitionsThermo Fisher Scientific has been on quite an aggressive acquisition strategy over the past few years. The company has completed six deals since 2014 and shows no signs of slowing down until 2019 at the earliest. This is when it plans to finish up spending $12 billion in acquisitions. Most recently, Thermo Fisher Scientific closed out a deal in March, purchasing Affymetrix, Inc. for $1.3 billion. The recent acquisitions are certainly starting to pay off, leading to about 3% revenue growth from the last quarter. Expect the aggressive acquisitions to continue to spark growth for the company in the long run.Thermo Fisher Scientific is currently planning the purchase of FEI Company (NASDAQ:FEIC) that would be at a cost of $4.2 billion in cash. FEI produces microscope technology. The deal is pending, and it is expected to go through in beginning of calendar year 2017. In the most recent quarterly results conference call, CEO Marc Casper addressed the acquisition, stating that it should help enhance the Analytical Instruments segment through direct impact. But he also stated that the company plans to use the technologies to expand into life sciences and applied markets. In analyzing the annual report from last year, it becomes apparent the lowest-performing business segment was the Analytical Instruments segment, only bringing in about 19% of sales revenue in 2015. Another key factor to observe in the deal is that FEI would bring on a balance of zero in long-term debt. This is great for Thermo Fisher Scientific as the acquisition will not tie up future cash flows and will further enhance any ratios involving debt.The combination of the fit FEI provides in Thermo Fisher Scientific's business segments, the lack of long-term debt, and the track record for previously successful acquisitions show how strategic of a move this is. It should give confidence to investors moving forward as the company continues to aggressively expand. Of course there are some possible pitfalls to the company during this period. TMO does risk overextending and making deals that don't turn out as expected. However, there have been no such signs of pitfalls in the company's acquisition strategy.Compared to the IndustryTMO data by YChartsAs evidenced by the chart, Thermo Fisher Scientific has outperformed the S&P 500 by about 11% on the year. It is also beating out the Healthcare sector and the Advanced Medical Equipment and Technology industry on the year. Compared to some main competitors, the company's fundamentals also match up fairly evenly. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A), and Becton, Dickinson and Co. (NYSE:BDX) could all be characterized as large-cap stocks along with Thermo Fisher Scientific. The aforementioned companies all have gross margins that fall around 50% and operating income margins around 15% (Becton Dickinson is an exception at 10%). However, none of these close competitors seem to be engaging in such an aggressive acquisition strategy like Thermo Fisher Scientific for the purpose of growth and industry dominance, making TMO a good, long-term buy."

        While Thermo Fisher has made its capital allocation priorities clear, we think its plan could use some revisiting. The firm remains active on the M&A front.
        Let's take a look at the firm's investment highlights as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares.","By The Valuentum TeamThermo Fischer Scientific (NYSE:TMO) operates in a $100 billion market that it expects to continue to grow at a 3%-5% annual pace, offering a long, steady runway of expansion. The firm believes it is positioned to grow at an annual rate of at least one percentage point faster than the broader healthcare markets it serves. Multiple long-term trends are driving growth in its businesses, including the aging population driving biomedical research and diagnostics demand, success in the development of biologics and vaccines creating a virtuous cycle of demand, and developing economies are fueling growth in environmental and a broad range of healthcare applications.Thermo Fisher remains active on the M&A front. In 2014, it acquired Life Technologies for ~$15 billion. In 2016, the firm closed the acquisition of Affymetrix for ~$1.3 billion, and recently agreed to purchase electron microscopy workflow solution manufacturer FEI Company (NASDAQ:FEIC) for ~$4.2 billion. The buyout of FEI Co is expected to expand Thermo Fisher's presence in the attractive materials science market as FEI Co's electron microscopy platform enhances Thermo Fisher's mass spectrometry offerings. The deal is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share immediately thanks to FEI Co's high-margin, recurring revenue stream. Thermo Fisher has also been rumored to have offered $30 billion for molecular diagnostic provider Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN).While Thermo Fisher has made its capital allocation priorities clear, we think its plan could use some revisiting. From 2010 to the first quarter of 2016, the firm deployed nearly 80% of its capital in M&A efforts, while the remaining 20% was dominated by share repurchases. Based on our fair value estimate, which is made available in the 'Valuation Analysis' portion of this article, we feel that ongoing share repurchases at this point in time are not of the significantly value-creating variety. In addition, the company's spending spree has resulted in levels of debt we would prefer not to see in a company with a $4.2 billion acquisition on the near-term horizon and the desire to continue such deal-making activity.Nevertheless, the excitement around Thermo Fisher's deals is real. Let's take a look at the firm's investment considerations as we work to iron out the true attractiveness of shares.Thermo Fisher Scientific's Investment ConsiderationsImage source: ValuentumInvestment Highlights• Thermo Fisher offers a range of high-end analytical instruments as well as laboratory equipment, chemicals, software, supplies and services, consumables and reagents. Its products include technologies for mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and biology research, among others. The company was founded in 1956 and is headquartered in Massachusetts• In early 2014, Thermo Fisher acquired Life Technologies for ~$15 billion, which the firm plans to follow with a series of aggressive actions in M&A. Most recent was the acquisition of FEI Company for $4.2 billion.• Thermo Fisher's markets are significant and growing. The specialty diagnostics market is about $20 billion annually and is expected to advance at a 4%-6% annual pace. The analytical technologies market is roughly $33 billion and growing at a similar rate. In all, Thermo Fisher is competing for roughly $100 billion in annual revenue.• Thermo Fisher is aggressively paying down debt after its acquisition streak, and the firm is targeting $3.4-$3.8 billion in free cash flow in 2018 (~20% of sales). Revenue is expected to grow at a 4%-5% CAGR and adjusted EPS in a range of 8%-12% without the impact of additional acquisitions over the same time period.• One of Thermo Fisher's key components of its vision for 2020 is to significantly increase its presence in the Asia-Pacific region and emerging markets. This should augment growth even further.Business QualityImage source: ValuentumEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Thermo Fisher Scientific's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 12.8%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.1%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of GOOD.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Image source: ValuentumImage source: ValuentumCash Flow AnalysisImage source: ValuentumFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Thermo Fisher Scientific's free cash flow margin has averaged about 13.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Thermo Fisher Scientific, cash flow from operations increased about 40% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 50% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think Thermo Fisher Scientific is worth $134 per share with a fair value range of $107-$161.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 10.7%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 23.5%, which is above Thermo Fisher Scientific's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.3% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Thermo Fisher Scientific, we use a 10.1% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Image source: ValuentumImage source: ValuentumImage source: ValuentumMargin of Safety AnalysisImage source: ValuentumOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $134 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Thermo Fisher Scientific. We think the firm is attractive below $107 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $161 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinionFuture Path of Fair ValueImage source: ValuentumWe estimate Thermo Fisher Scientific's fair value at this point in time to be about $134 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Thermo Fisher Scientific's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $180 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $134 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

While a $4.2 billion deal cannot be called a small acquisition, the deal adds just 5% to Thermo's annual sales, indicating that the transaction is by far not a transformative deal.I must say that I like the overall deal, Thermo's track record with regards to dealmaking, while the long-term prospects for the underlying businesses look sound. While all these factors favor an investment in Thermo, I am not enticed to aggressively initiate a position. A somewhat leveraged balance sheet and premium valuation multiples are the main reasons why I am not a buyer at today's levels.Purchase Of FEIThermo is willing to pay $107.50 in cash for each share of FEI, valuing the electron microscopy company at $4.2 billion. While the actual equity valuation of FEI is a bit higher, the deal tag is adjusted for net cash holdings of some $400 million.FEI's 3,000 workers focus on electron microscopy, often used by life sciences or high performance materials industries. Scientists use these technologies to develop new applications or improve the current techniques.The business generated $930 million in sales for 2015 and enjoys solid organic growth rates, as revenues have doubled over the past decade. Upon closure of the deal, FEI will become part of Thermo's analytical instrument business.Within this segment, FEI's solutions will be combined with Thermo's expertise in mass spectrometry, allowing Thermo to better capitalize on the growing life science trend, as well as the spectacular trend in protein research. The increased quality of offers can furthermore be provided to a larger group of customers, as Thermo has a much larger customer base.On top of the strategic benefits, there are real financial benefits as well. Thermo anticipates costs synergies of $55 million. FEI's public listing costs can be avoided, its effective tax rate is anticipated to drop significantly as well. The increase in the anticipated revenues will boost operating earnings by another $25 million, providing a potential boost of $80 million to operating earnings. Thermo itself claims that the deal will boost earnings by $0.30 per share, which amounts to roughly $120 million a year but this number is a non-GAAP number.Based on the $4.2 billion deal tag, Thermo is paying a 4.5 times sales multiple. With EBITDA coming in at $186 million, the multiples look steep at 22 times. If you take into account the anticipated synergies, the multiple drops towards roughly 16 times EBITDA. Based on FEI's net earnings, the current earnings multiple of 33 times earnings will drop towards 25 times earnings. While these multiples are certainly cheap, Thermo is essentially betting that the improved capabilities should result in more revenue synergies in the years to come.Just A Minor AdditionWhile FEI is a very nice business with a great track record, its contribution to Thermo's business will be relatively limited.Thermo generated $17 billion in sales for the year 2015, indicating that FEI will contribute merely 5% to overall revenues. The analytical instrument business, in which FEI will be ""placed,"" generated sales of $3.2 billion last year.Thermo's income statement is somewhat complicated by tax considerations and large amortization charges from past dealmaking. The company reported operating earnings of $2.3 billion and net earnings of $2.0 billion. These numbers are based on GAAP accounting.Thermo reports non-GAAP earnings as well, which excludes all the restructuring and impairment charges of past dealmaking. Adjusted for these items, operating earnings came in at $3.8 billion in 2015, as net earnings amounted to $3.0 billion.The company is off to a good start in 2016, posting 10% organic revenue growth in constant currency terms for the first quarter. As cash holdings stood at just $827 million, Thermo will engage in more borrowing to finance the purchase of FEI. Total regular debt stood at $15 billion already by the end of the quarter, and this number even excludes moderate pension related obligations. If I add in the $4.2 billion deal for FEI, net debt is seen at $18-$19 billion at the moment.Including the run rate of Thermo's own business and the expected contribution made by FEI, Thermo will post sales of roughly $19 billion. Without FEI the company guides for $3.2 billion in non-GAAP earnings this year, as the gap with GAAP earnings is probably around a billion.At the moment, Thermo has 399 million shares outstanding. At $150 per share, this implies an equity valuation of $60 billion. Based on the net debt load, the enterprise valuation thereby comes in at roughly $78 billion. That is equivalent to 4 times sales, as equity of the business trades at 18 times non-GAAP earnings. While that does not appear to be a demanding multiple, the gap with GAAP earnings is large. If GAAP earnings come in at $2.3 billion this year, the multiple rises to 27 times earnings.This is quite an elevated valuation multiple, certainly as the leverage position is fairly high at nearly 4 times EBITDA.Quality Wins Over Time, Buy On DipsThermo Fisher is a very diversified conglomerate which operates in markets with high margins and enjoys structural tailwinds. Besides simply operating well in these growing markets, the company has been very active with regards to dealmaking, accelerating the growth trajectory.Real growth started with the 2006 merger between Thermo Electric and Fisher Scientific, a deal which resulted in the current name of the firm. This merger was complemented by add-on deals as well as the +$13 billion deal to acquire Life Technologies back in 2013.Following the merger in 2006, Thermo Fisher has still managed to double its sales in the ten years which followed. The good thing is that this has been complemented by real margin gains, as GAAP operating margins improved 3-4 points to 13-14% of sales. While debt has been incurred as a result of acquisitions, Thermo has actually reduced the share count by a tenth.While leverage is high, Thermo's business is very predictable and generates quite a lot of cash as earnings are understating cash flows as a result of large impairment charges. These cash flows and a very modest dividend yield allow the company to reduce leverage at a quick pace.While Thermo has grown the underlying business at a steady pace, shares have been trading in the $30-$60 range in the 2006-2012 period. This implies that valuation multiples have been compressing, until Thermo announced the deal to acquire Life in 2013. A huge momentum run allowed shares to double, ending 2013 at around $100 per share. This run has been followed by steady gains ever since, with shares now trading at $150 per share.You can hardly argue that shares are cheap at 27 times GAAP earnings, even as the business has rosy prospects. The 4 times leverage ratio seems high, but the non-cash amortization charges allow for quick deleveraging if the company temporarily halts share repurchases. A full valuation and high leverage position leave few triggers to send shares higher in my eyes, as the balance sheet does not allow for large buyback programs. The same holds for the very low effective tax rate which creates the potential for headwinds as well amidst the crackdown on corporate tax rates."
2390095,64423,2014-08-06T15:33:41-04:00,"TMO reported very impressive numbers on July 23, 2014.The increased synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and the impending divestiture of the Cole-Parmer business resulted in raised guidance.The Life Technologies takeover has led to the emergence of an unrivaled market leader serving research, specialty diagnostics and applied markets.","On the last Tuesday of 2011 I made my last purchase of the year. I had been working on a project of analyzing the available Mutual Funds in the 401(k) I was about to begin contributions into, and decided to rank them by ranking each of the holdings using the same criteria I used in my general trading and IRA investments. Also, at the time, I was using the project to teach my wife the ins-and-outs of my process, and it came down to choosing between two whose metrics were almost virtually identical and I did not have a specific pulling to one or the other--so I let her choose.She picked Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO), the maker of analytical instruments, equipment, reagents and consumables, software, and services for research, manufacturing, analysis,discovery, and diagnostics in the United States and internationally. Since then we have enjoyed a total return of +96.44%, including reinvested dividends. My only regret was not putting a much more sizeable stake into her pick!TMO was among the first group of stocks which I had chosen with the addition of PEG to my metric screen (thanks to one of the holiday episodes of Jim Cramer filmed ahead of time about general trading principals), and I credit this addition of PEG to my much more refined stock picking from that time forward. I also see several bad choices I could have avoided with PEG in my arsenal rather than P/E, as P/E is not very useful in comparisons between stocks in different industries without constantly adjusting expected P/E for the industry/sector, and in comparison to the P/E of the broader market--which can be done, but for me I like the much more graphical finality of ""Is this a PEG of less than 2, or is the PEG more than two?"". A PEG of less than two is very desirable and has rarely steered me wrong in the last almost 3 years. I cannot think of similar specific instances where P/E ever influenced me as clearly.So I have been happy with TMO, and as of the most recent earnings report on July 23, 2014, TMO surpassed the adjusted EPS from the year prior by 30%, boding well for continued future value generation. Revenues increased by 33% from 2013, 27% of that due to acquisitions. TMO also increased their EPS guidance slightly, from 25% to 26% on the low end and from 28% to 29% on the high end.However, if I were to apply my screen to the stock as I did back in December, 2011, TMO would not be a buy at these levels. They have become a victim of their own success in this regard, like much of the broader market, running up to levels that are prohibitive of accumulation for value growth. The PEG has creeped up to 2.56, prohibitively high for me to consider initiating a position unless a lot of compelling evidence is found elsewhere. In this case, it would not be dividend, as this has also been negatively affected by price appreciation, drifting down to 0.60%. Also, at the end of 2011, TMO had fallen sharply during the course of the previous six months, whereas now it is just 5.65% below the 52 week high of $127.32, giving TMO a very high implied run room in 2011 that does not exist now. The two bright notes I would point out, indeed as a case to hold even if accumulation is off the table, is the Analyst Recommended Mean Consensus score of 1.50, and a Consensus target price of $141.79 is a 14.4% increase over Tuesday's close of $121.38.Average revenue growth of 7.66% per year for the past 5 years is pretty impressive for a 13 billion dollar turnover company. However due to sharp increase in operating cost, TMO is unable to keep up the growth in terms of net profit. Strong management and good cost control measures are needed in order for the company to sustain growth in the long run. Only growth in the company's net profit will be the key to achieve capital gain for shareholders.Additional Thoughts:Pros• Revenue is in a growing trend with a good 5 year increasing track record. Average increment of 7.66% per year.Cons• Net income slipped since 2012 financial year as compared to 2013 due to sharp increases in operating cost. Current net earnings (FY2013) are still below what was achieved in FY 2011.• Net profit margin of 10.76% is on the low side considering the company is in a non-retail sector.• Current Ratio is at 1.36 which shows that the company still has a significant amount of debt on hand (Current Ratio = Current Assets/Current Liabilities).• Again, the Dividend payout ratio of 15% and Dividend yield of 0.6% is less attractive to my investing strategy.Now, to summarize: I would not be accumulating TMO at these levels, but still consider them a very viable holding, and would look to add to my holdings if the price to purchase dropped to the $98 or below range, or if the PEG Ratio dropped below 2.Disclosure: The author is long TMO.

1188181,35761,2013-02-15T12:52:30-05:00,,"Shares of Life Technologies (NASDAQ:LIFE), one of the world's largest life science companies, have soared in just the first few weeks of 2013, rising over 28% year-to-date as the rumors swirl over a potential sale of the company. On January 18, Life's board of directors issued a statement in which it confirmed that Deutsche Bank and Moelis & Co. have been hired to assist in its annual strategic review. Shares of Life jumped to their highest levels since creation in the 2008 merger of Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems. During the company's Q4 2012 earnings call in early February, CEO Greg Lucier offered additional details, saying that the company's review began in the summer of 2012 when LIFE was trading in the low 40's and that ""all ideas are on the table.""Since Life confirmed that it has hired Deutsche Bank and Moelis & Co., several potential suitors have emerged, including a few private equity firms, as well as Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO). It's this potential bid from Thermo that I'll explore first.Thermo Fisher: Cementing Its Market Lead?In late January, Reuters reported that Thermo Fisher, the largest life science company in the world, is considering a bid for Life, which would be the company's biggest deal since the $12.8 billion merger of Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific in 2006. And given that Life already has a market capitalization approaching $11 billion, the premium needed to take control of the company may push the total cost to over $12.8 billion. On the surface, such a deal makes sense. Thermo Fisher and Life Technologies sell their products to many of the same customers, which creates opportunities for cost and revenue synergies. For example, Credit Suisse believes that Thermo Fisher could see a 10-11% increase in EPS, even before accounting for what the firm believes will be $400 million in cost savings. However, such a deal will come with several complications. The biggest obstacles are financial.The life sciences sector is one that naturally lends itself to M&A given that many companies in the sector sell to the same customers, which leads to a high level of potential synergies in a merger and/or takeover. However, years of deal making have weakened balance sheets across the sector, with goodwill and debt accumulating in many cases. Thermo Fisher has $12.4745 billion in goodwill on its balance sheet, which represents 45.59% of the company's total assets. In addition, Thermo Fisher ended Q4 2012 with $6.269 billion in net debt. The company's aggressive capital deployment strategies have served investors well, with shares of Thermo Fisher up over 34% over the past year. But constant M&A, buybacks and dividends have weakened Thermo Fisher's credit ratings. In July 2012, all 3 ratings agencies downgraded Thermo Fisher on the back of its $925 million takeover of One Lambda, which was announced alongside a new buyback program. S&P rates the company as A-, 4 steps above junk; Moody's rates it as Baa1, 3 steps above junk; and Fitch rates the company BBB+, 3 steps above junk. With only $855.3 million in cash, Thermo Fisher will need to either issue stock or debt to fund a deal for Life Technologies, something that may not sit well with the company's investors or bondholders.Sources close to Thermo Fisher have indicated that the company is uninterested in Life's sequencing business, which is the source of much of Life's future expected growth. Given that Life's board of directors and investors may hold out for over $70 per share, Thermo Fisher's investors may not approve of a deal over $10 billion for a company with a lower growth profile than that of Thermo Fisher when the sequencing business is excluded (that being said, a divestiture of the sequencing business could help defray some of the cost needed to take control of Life). Bondholders of Thermo Fisher may also voice objections. In addition to the increased leverage that Thermo Fisher will likely need to acquire Life, there is also Life's own balance sheet to contend with. The company currently holds $276.369 million in cash and investments, versus debt of $2.414069 billion. In addition, based on the company's Q3 2012 10Q (a full balance sheet for Q4 2012 has not yet been released), 51.93% of Life Technologies' assets are in the form of goodwill. Should Thermo Fisher take control of Life, goodwill will be piled on top of goodwill, and the company will likely add billions of debt to its balance sheet, further weakening its credit profile. And while Thermo Fisher would also gain control of Life Technologies' solid cash flows, it's likely that any incremental increase in cash flow will be used to pay down debt as opposed to increasing the dividend or buying back stock. Thermo Fisher's management team may have to work hard to convince investors of the rationale behind a deal for Life Technologies, something that could very well cause the company to walk away from the negotiating table. While other potential suitors have been named, such as GE (NYSE:GE) and Danaher (NYSE:DHR), Thermo Fisher has emerged as the most likely acquirer, and analysts are skeptical that either GE or Danaher will be tempted to make a bid for Life.Private Equity: Can A Deal be Done?Reuters has reported that multiple private equity firms, including KKR, Blackstone, Bain Capital and TPG are weighing bids for Life Technologies. A private equity of Life Technologies would represent the largest healthcare leveraged buyout since the end of the financial crisis, with Credit Suisse estimating that at least $7 billion of equity would be needed to take control of the company. A leveraged buyout of Life Technologies is further complicated by price. Rumors of a deal have sent shares of Life to their highest levels since the creation of the company. However, given the leverage that will be added to Life's balance sheet, as well as the leverage already on it, it's likely that private equity firms cannot afford to pay as much as a strategic buyer. Jefferies, for example, has said that a leveraged buyout can occur at a price of between $50-$60 per share, which is already below the company's current share price. JPMorgan has said that a buyout could occur at between $65-$75 per share; the midpoint of this range implies a premium of 11.34% to current prices. However, it's unclear if $70 per share would be enough to sway Life's investors. Since the beginning of 2010, and until buyout rumors surfaced, shares of Life had been mostly range-bound, and its investors may want to see a more substantial premium, one that a private equity firm (or consortium of firms) is unable to provide. However, a divestiture of the company's sequencing business could make a transaction more likely. Private equity buyers are primarily interested in the high degree of recurring revenue at Life, and the cash flows that it provides, not the company's future growth potential. Given the interest in genetic sequencing, it may be easier to find a buyer for this business if it is offered without the rest of Life.Almost $44 Million Reasons for a DealInvestors often forget that merger and deal negotiations fall apart not because of price, leverage, or other financial factors, but because of the people involved. Perhaps there are conflicts over who will run the combined company, or the executive teams simply don't get along. Conversely, mergers often happen because there are incentives for executives to strike a deal. Perhaps they need to find a successor for themselves, wish to move on to a new venture, or are facing pressure from activist investors. A third possibility? the prospect of millions in payments for completing a deal.Life's most current proxy statement discloses that CEO Greg Lucier stands to earn $43,794,422 in severance payments if he is terminated following a change of control. And even if he is terminated with cause following a change of control, he still stands to earn over $12 million in severance, which gives him incentive not to oppose a deal. While the company's board of directors will make the final decision on any sale, they'll seek input from Greg Lucier, who is also the board's chairman. And given the millions he stands to earn from termination following a change of control, it's likely that he will, at a minimum, not oppose a deal. It should be noted that this provision favors a strategic acquirer. Private equity firms are likely to leave Lucier in the corner office. However, a strategic buyer, such as Thermo Fisher, is far less likely to leave Lucier in charge. And given that Mark Casper, Thermo Fisher's own CEO, is 43, there's no reason for him to do this deal to bring in a successor, especially given the fact that Greg Lucier is 47. Lucier will likely be terminated if Thermo Fisher takes control of Life (at most, Lucier could move to a new division at Thermo Fisher that would house Life). Lucier's compensation package isn't going to be the key factor that leads to a takeover, but it's a facet worth noting, as it gives the CEO a solid reason to support a deal.Life's Standalone ProspectsThe question that investors need to ponder at this point in time is whether or not it is wise to buy shares of Life Technologies at these levels. I believe that Life's standalone prospects are good in the long-term, not because of its sequencing business, but rather because of its valuation.There is a reason that Illumina has been able to not only retain, but expand its lead in sequencing. It is focused solely on sequencing (and ancillary genetics businesses), whereas Life focuses on a far wider variety of markets. Combined with a lack of meaningful research and development spending, it's unsurprising to see that Illumina leads the sequencing market. In 2012, Illumina spent 20.12% of its revenues on research and development, while Life spent just 9%. And that 9% was split amongst many more divisions and product lines. Life's saving grace lies in its valuation. At current prices, Life trades at 15.94x trailing 12-month earnings, versus 31.3x for Illumina (not to say that Illumina is overpriced - its growth prospects and industry-leading margins and balance sheet warrant a premium valuation). The table below breaks down Life's consensus forecasts and its forward valuation (P/E multiples are based on Life's closing price of $63.44 as of February 13).Life Technologies Earnings ForecastsWhile Life may not be growing at the same rate as Illumina, its multiples are less than half of those of its primary competitor, and the company has been steadily buying back stock, with its diluted share count falling by 3.36% over the course of 2012. Life's strategic review may result in something to boost shareholder value, even if it does not result in a sale. CEO Greg Lucier has stated that all options are on the table. It's possible that Life will initiate a dividend or buy back stock in a more aggressive fashion. That, combined with the inherent stability of Life's recurring revenues (a key reason private equity firms may be considering the company) and cash flows, as well as its forecasted growth as a standalone company, are not a bad combination for investors to be exposed to.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1724512,54812,2013-10-02T04:42:28-04:00,,"SummaryShares of Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) - a provider of analytical instruments, reagents and consumables, equipment, services for research, software, manufacture analysis, diagnostics and discovery - showed little change in September, ending the month very near where they started. On a yearly basis, however, share performance was quite different with share prices almost doubling to $92.15 from $57.21. This was accomplished in spite of all the turmoil the healthcare industry has faced in the past year. Thermo Fisher Scientific has been the world's leader in servicing science since 1956. Its growth stems from a pool of services, products and solutions that it provides for analysis, research, diagnostics and discovery. With annual revenues of $13 billion, it continues to create value through its premier brands Fisher Scientific, Thermo Scientific and Unity Lab Services.Financials GrowthThis company's revenue rose 4.2% Y-Y. The stock's 50-day moving average was $91.34, while its 200-day moving average was $85.73. By end-September, cost per share increased by almost $0.30. Sales growth is estimated to increase 3.2% for the year and 3.8% next year.Overall growth of the company is expected to increase annually by 8.75% annually over the next five years, a substantial decrease from the annual growth rate of 13.83% during the previous five years. Thermo Fisher Scientific is not alone in this projection, as it is estimated that the entire sector will also see a similar decrease. At the same time, the annual growth rate in the sector will still be much higher than Thermo Fisher Scientific's, at least double, in the coming five years.Thermo Fisher Scientific had revenue of $12.78 billion for the trailing 12 months (June 29, 2013), which translates to $35.52 per share. Its operating cash flow was $1.92 billion and its levered free cash flow was $1.43 billion. The share price also rose 57.03% increase in the past year. At the end of the most recent quarter, its balance sheet showed total cash of $1.42 billion and total debt of $7.11 billion, an unhealthy ratio.HighlightsThermo Fisher Scientific's financial highlights includes revenue valued at $12.78 billion for the trailing twelve months (June 29, 2013). This equals out to $35.52 revenue per share. At the same time, the balance sheet displays total cash at $1.42 billion for the most recent quarter. The total debt is valued at $7.11 billion, which is almost $6 billion higher than the total cash. This displays an unhealthy ratio for TMO. Their operating cash flow is $1.92 billion and their levered free cash flow is $1.43 billion for the trailing twelve months. Also, there has been a 57.03% increase in the stock price for the past 52 weeks.Thermo Fisher Scientific renewed its agreement with Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics on Sept. 4. The long-term agreement, which covers all countries outside the United States and China, is for the use of Thermo Fisher Scientific's procalcitonin technology (B.R.A.H.M.S PCT (T.M)), technology that is used as an automated immunoassay by Siemens ADVIA Centaur XP and CP systems. Following the renewal, Thermo Fisher Scientific said, ""The continuation of our close collaboration with Siemens significantly increases the global reach of this critical biomarker, making it available to a broader patient population."" This is one of the highlights for Thermo Fisher Scientific, along with their stock's performance in the last three trading sessions. TMO'S stock largely outperformed the S&P 500 in the same period. TMO saw an increase of 7.01%, while S&P 500 saw an increase of 0.72%. These key advancements allows the company to retain its rating as a strong ""buy.""Disclosure: I am long TMO.

1342261,21877,2013-04-15T13:50:18-04:00,,"The long-swirling rumors have at last coalesced  into fact: Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) is to acquire the gene sequencing  company Life Technologies. The deal will clock in at $13.6bn, making it  comfortably the most expensive this year so far, and almost certainly  2013’s largest overall.The buyout had been so widely expected – despite competing bids from Sigma-Aldrich and  a private consortium – that definitive news of the agreement came  almost as an anticlimax. The price, however, did come as a bit of a  shock: analysts had been expecting bids in the range of $11bn. Thermo  Fisher has spent top dollar to get a foothold in the genetic analysis  sector. With genomic sequencing getting faster and cheaper all the time,  it might have picked its moment wisely.Thermo Fisher’s $76-per-share bid, a 12% premium over Life’s closing price of $68 on Friday, beat an offer from Sigma-Aldrich and  a $65 bid from a consortium including Blackstone, Carlyle, KKR and  Temasek Holdings. Life’s board of directors met on Saturday to review  the three offers; both Life’s and Thermo Fisher’s boards have now  approved the transaction.AccretiveOf the $13.6bn price tag, the company expects the  split to be cash and debt of $9.5 to $10bn and equity of up to $4bn. The  transaction will close by early 2014, Thermo Fisher said. The company  expects the transaction immediately – and significantly – to add to its  adjusted EPS, despite having agreed to assume Life’s debt, which was  around $2.2bn at the end of last year. Thermo Fisher also expects to  maintain an investment-grade rating after the transaction has closed.The price, at 3.6x Life Technologies’ 2012 sales of $3.8bn, is relatively generous by recent medtech deal standards (William Demant moves into fast-growing cochlear implant sector, April 3, 2013).  Considering that the purchase could increase Thermo Fisher's annual  revenue to more than $16bn, it is perhaps money well spent.Thermo Fisher says that its new incarnation will be  the unrivaled leader in serving research, specialty diagnostics and  applied markets, and will enable faster turnaround for customers working  in proteomics, genomics and cell biology.Life’s products include reagents and consumables as  well as instruments and systems, but the aspect that has attracted  rival bidders is its recent investment in next-generation  genetic-sequencing technology. Adding this to its own analytical and  diagnostics operations could help Thermo Fisher produce molecular  diagnostics or aid in personalized medicine.The other large player in gene sequencing and analysis, Roche,  has been left in the dust. The situation may nudge the Basel group  towards making yet another attempt to grab Illumina to try to shore up  its position. But given that the last try ended in humiliation for Roche and a share price tumble for Illumina, it could be forgiven for being reluctant (Illumina splurges $450m on Verinata after Roche walks out, January 8, 2013).It has been suggested in recent years that genomic  research has failed to live up to its promise. It will be interesting to  see whether Thermo Fisher can make a success of its investment."
1449991,47721,2013-05-21T11:35:51-04:00,,"The life sciences and healthcare technology industry is projecting a slim outlook for FY13 as the performance of the industry is positively related to the global economy. As budget cuts reduce the demand for pharmaceutical products and patent cliffs further the problem, the industry's growth is expected to slow in FY13 and pick up from the following year. However, the scientific instruments and medical research industry which includes medical devices, diagnostic equipment and other healthcare supplies seems to be performing better. According the Deloitte's 2013 outlook, the revenue growth in this segment is driven by an aging population, disease trends and technological advancements.Source: Deloitte 2013 OutlookThe above chart illustrates the revenue growth in the medical devices and diagnostic equipments industry over the last nine years. Furthermore, companies in this industry are also pursuing their growth through acquisitions as some of the larger players look to acquire their competitors. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one similar company which is currently looking to acquire another major player of the industry, Life Technologies Corp. (NASDAQ:LIFE). Thermo Fisher, with its growth strategies, variety of products and regional diversification, has the capacity to become a profitable stock for investors.Revenue Profile And Stock Price TrendsThe company has exposure to four different markets which include Industry and Applied markets, Healthcare and  Diagnostics, Pharma and  Biotech and Academic and  Government. In terms of products, the company provides consumables, instruments, equipment and  software.Source: Annual Report FY12The chart above illustrates that the business exposure is spread almost evenly across all four markets. The major source of revenues for the company comes from consumables as this product segment contributes to 55% of the company's total revenues. The chart also shows the regional diversification of the company. Currently, the company has 54% exposure to North America and the exposure to Asia-Pacific is limited to 17%. However, the company is thoroughly pursuing its expansion strategy in Asia.Source: Deloitte 2013 OutlookThe above chart illustrates the forecasted growth rates of different regions. As the demand for this sub-industry is driven primarily by overall economic growth, the growth strategy to pursue expansion in Asia will prove extremely effective as economic growth in Asia is expected to outperform the other regions. The company has specific focus on China as the country has proved to be very prolific for Thermo Fisher's growth in the Asian region.Source: BloombergThe above chart shows the performance of Thermo Fisher's stock against the S&P 500 index over a period of one year. The chart evidently illustrates the company has been consistently outperforming the index since August FY12. This trend is expected to persist as the company stands firm on its future growth prospects.Financial AnalysisThe growth prospects of the company need to be supported by financial strength and stability in order to allow for sustainable profitable growth. In order to evaluate these aspects of the company's financial performance a three part DuPont Analysis has been conducted.Data Source: MorningstarThe above chart illustrates a breakdown of the company's ROE into three parts - Net Margin, Asset Turnover and Financial Leverage. There are two important points to be noted from this analysis. Firstly, the ROE is showing an upward trend in the long run as indicated by the linear trend line. Secondly, the ROE is supported majorly by net margins and the company has maintained its ROE without increasing its financial risk which is reflected by the low financial leverage ratio of the company.Comparative AnalysisUsing a few key indicators, a comparative analysis has been conducted in order to estimate the potential of the company as compared to its competitors. Key growth and valuation metrics have been used to evaluate the company in this aspect. Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) and Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) have been used here.Data Source: MorningstarThe above table has been divided into two sections. The first part illustrates the revenue and net income growth (3 year averages) along with the D/E ratio of the company. The table clearly shows that the company outperforms its competitors and the overall industry in all three aspects. The second part of the table refers to the valuation of the company and we can clearly see that the company is undervalued with respect to P/B ratio. The P/E ratio is also well below the industry average but when we introduce the earnings growth prospects, we achieve a PEG ratio which is less than the two competitors.ConclusionThermo Fisher is looking specifically towards the Asian markets for growth. Currently, the region's contribution towards the company's revenues is strong. Therefore, this strategy will provide an opportunity to improve revenues and increase regional diversification. Furthermore, the financial strength of the company and the cheap valuation as compared to its competitors on the basis of financial performance will serve as key drivers for the stock price appreciation. Therefore, I recommend a buy position for the long term. Investors in the short run might have to witness undesirable volatility but in the long run, the stock will prove to be profitable.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Consequently, investors shouldn't completely lose sight of the underlying fundamentals at this lead life sciences company. Those fundamentals are actually looking pretty good right now, though the chatter around a possible transaction has pushed the shares to a point where there's not much fundamental value left.A Surprising Upturn In GrowthLife Tech's results for the fourth quarter weren't that far off of the averaged sell-side estimates, but then they seldom are for this company. Revenue came in about 1% higher than expected, as the company saw 3% reported sales growth and organic growth of better than 4%. Research Consumables (up more than 4% organic) and Applied Sciences (up 10% organic) both surprised to the upside, while the 4% organic growth in Genetic Analysis was basically as expected.Margin performance was a little more mixed. Gross margin rose about 20 basis points on an adjusted basis, but missed the average estimate by about 40bp due in large part to a higher mix of instruments (particularly in the Ion Torrent unit). Management definitely boosted marketing expenses (up 9%), partly to support the growing Chinese business and partly due to acquisitions, leading to flat adjusted operating income that was nevertheless just a bit ahead of expectations.Business Trends Looking Mostly Pretty GoodRelative to the life science sector, Life Tech seems to be doing pretty well. The company came in a little ahead of Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) in terms of organic growth, and while Life Tech certainly lagged Illumina's (NASDAQ:ILMN) 24% growth for the fourth quarter, the businesses are difficult to compare on a like-for-like basis.Said differently, investors shouldn't compare the 24% growth at Illumina with the 4% growth in Genetic Analysis and assume that Illumina is eating the company's lunch - Life Tech's results include more mature businesses/equipment like PCR and electrophoresis, and Ion Torrent continues to do quite well, with Life Tech now holding more than half of the benchtop sequencing market.A big question is the extent to which this upturn is sustainable. The risk of sequestration is not completely off the table yet, and companies like Agilent (NYSE:A), Thermo, and Danaher (NYSE:DHR) are being/have been relatively cautious with the 2013 outlook.The Elephant In The Room - A Deal For Life TechWhile Life Tech does an annual strategic review every year (that's what ""annual"" is supposed to mean), this year's review is getting considerably more attention. I haven't been able to determine whether the hiring of advisory firms is a normal part of the process that it has done in years past, but investors are clearly paying more attention this time. It certainly hasn't hurt that management has commented more than once in the past year that a deal would be something it would look it if the stock's valuation didn't improve.So now the question is whether a deal will happen and how such a deal might go down. On balance, I think the odds still favor Life Tech staying independent but I won't argue that there aren't some strategic buyers out there who could do a lot with these assets.If Life Tech goes with a strategic buyer, Thermo is probably at the top of the list. Life Tech would be an excellent complement to existing businesses at Thermo like mass spec and chromatography and would not only round out the company's offerings in biological sciences and expand its diagnostics capabilities, but would make it even more of a one-stop shop for academic, government and industry (bio/pharm) customers. What's more, there would be substantial synergy potential and Thermo could earn a good rate of return on a deal even at a meaningfully higher price. That said, Thermo likely doesn't want the sequencing business and the overlap in PCR (and other areas) could require some sales.Thermo is hardly the only buyer who would make sense, though. Unfortunately, a lot of the other buyers have ""buts"" attached. Given that 80% of Life Tech's sales are consumables/disposables, it seems like a great business for Danaher and one that would fit well with businesses like Leica and Beckman. On the other hand, Life Tech would be a very large deal for Danaher and would throw the balance even more heavily toward life sciences - something Danaher management has already said it doesn't want to do. That said, if any management team has the reserve of goodwill to do this deal and say, in essence, ""we saw a great opportunity and changed our minds,"" it's Danaher.For most of the same reasons as Danaher, Life Tech would make a lot of sense for Agilent, but that would pretty much be a merger of equals if there was much further acquisition premium for Life Tech.There are a few other large-cap name ideas that I think could be dark horse players/bidders. General Electric (NYSE:GE) has talked a lot about wanting to get into diagnostics and advanced sequencing, and this would be a chance to put its money where its mouth has been.While Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has said it is exploring a sale of its diagnostics business, maybe the acquisition of Life Tech wouldn't be so ridiculous, as it would be a solid new growth platform that could help turn around the Ortho diagnostics business.Last and not least, maybe 3M (NYSE:MMM) would take advantage of the opportunity - the emphasis on consumables fits the 3M model nicely, as does the focus on healthcare, and 3M already provides different products to many of the same customers (meaning potential synergies). Remember, though, I called these ""dark horse"" ideas for a reason - I don't expect any of the three to actually get involved.And then there are private bidders (private equity groups and the like). There's a lot about Life Tech that would appeal to this group, including the nearly annuity-like nature of a lot of the business. At the same time, private equity investors are not really famous for wanting to reinvest large sums of capital into their holdings, so I'm not sure the R&D-needy sequencing and next-gen diagnostic businesses would fit. What's more, I'd expect more than a little pruning of low-growth/low-return Life Tech assets in such a scenario, with companies like Bio-Rad (NYSE:BIO) likely standing by to cherry-pick.Behind or beside all of this, I think another large potential bidder is in play - Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY). Roche has famously gone around and around (and around...) with Illumina on a potential acquisition, before recently walking away and saying that it was done. Maybe it is done with Illumina, but it still needs a better sequencing and life sciences platform than it has, particularly if it wants to enhance its internal drug development and diagnostics capabilities.Roche could play this two ways. First, Roche could just make a bid for Life Tech - the business as a whole may not be exactly what it wants, and it would have to do something about the overlap in PCR, but adding to its capabilities in areas like cell culture, sample prep, and cell analysis would hardly be a bad thing. Alternatively, Roche could work with another bidder that wants Life Tech's ""regular"" business, but not the next-gen sequencing (like Thermo or a private equity group) and buy that unit from it (and maybe some of LIFE's recently acquired diagnostics businesses as well). With that business arguably more than $2 billion, it could be a win-win - it would defray the cost of a bid and eliminate the need for heavy R&D reinvestment, while giving Roche the next-gen sequencing technology it wants.So What's It All Worth?Not surprisingly, the deal chatter around Life Tech has inspired investors to break out their pencils, run the numbers, and bid the shares up. An estimate of mid-single digit revenue growth and slightly higher free cash flow growth (5% to 8%) suggests a fair value in the mid $60s, and that's where the stock sits today.To a strategic or financial buyer, though, the stock could be worth even more. Past deals - Thermo/One Lambda, Agilent/Dako, Hologic (NASDAQ:HOLX)/Gen-Probe, TPG/Immucor, Thermo/Dionex, and Merck KgaA/Millipore - suggest a value of about $72 per LIFE share on the low end (12x EBITDA) to perhaps more than $90 on a median multiple (17x EBITDA). While I'd argue that the lower top-line growth potential of Life Tech argues toward the lower end of the range, those other deals didn't offer the same synergies, nor the Ion Torrent asset, and Life Tech is definitely not a ""fixer-upper"" like Dako or Beckman Coulter.The Bottom LineI think there's a two-thirds chance that Life Tech stays independent when all of this is said and done. Working out a probability-weighted scenario analysis, a fair value of about $70 seems reasonable today. That means about a 10% expected return from these levels - not a stellar return, I'll grant, but not terrible either considering the possibility of a bid well into the $70s or $80s and the downside of owning a high-quality life sciences business with an independent going concern value in the mid-$60s.Disclosure: I am long MMM, OTCQX:RHHBY.

1343681,25120,2013-04-16T06:56:58-04:00,,"Shares of Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) saw quite a lot of volatility on ""Merger Monday."" The company which is a world leader in servicing science, announced the anticipated acquisition of Life Technologies (NASDAQ:LIFE) in a $13.6 billion deal.Shares of Thermo Fisher opened up with gains of 5%, but closed with losses a little over one percent as enthusiasm about the deal faded while equity markets continued to slump. Shares of Life Technologies rose 7.5% to $73.11 per share, trading at a 3.8% discount to Thermo's offer.The DealThermo Fisher announced that it has agreed to acquire Life Technologies, a global life sciences company. Under terms of the deal, Thermo will pay $76 per share in cash for the shares of the company, or $13.6 billion for the equity of the firm. Thermo will furthermore assume roughly $2.2 billion in net debt held by the firm.Combined, the deal will create a leader in serving research, specialty diagnostics and applied markets. The technological strength of both firms will accelerate the results in life sciences working in the promising worlds of proteomics, genomics and cell biology.Life Technologies holds over 5,000 patents and licenses and employs over 10,000 workers across the world.For the year of 2012, Life Technologies generated annual revenues of $3.8 billion on which the company reported a net profit of $431 million.The $13.6 billion price tag for the equity of Life values the company at 3.6 times annual revenues and 31-32 times annual earnings.Thermo Fisher expects to generate adjusted operating income synergies of at least $275 million in three years following the close of the deal, of which $250 million is achieved by cost synergies. The deal will be accretive to adjusted earnings per share by $0.90-$1.00 per share in the first year following completion.The deal is expected to close early in 2014 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.ValuationThermo Fisher ended its fiscal year of 2012 with $855 million in cash, equivalents and short term investments. The company operates with $7.1 billion in short and long term debt, for a net debt position of roughly $6.3 billion. Thermo Fisher will finance the deal by issuing some $9.5-$10 billion in new debt and it will issue $4 million in new equity.The company generated full year revenues of $12.5 billion, up 8.2% on the year before. Net income fell almost 12% to $1.18 billion, to $3.21 per share. Note that 2011's earnings included a $305 million one-time gain.Factoring in a decline of little more than one percent, the market values the firm at little above $28 billion. This values the firm's equity at 2.2 times annual revenues and 23-24 times annual earnings.Thermo Fisher pays a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 0.8%.Some Historical PerspectiveLong term shareholders in Thermo Fisher have seen very healthy returns. Shares quadrupled over the past decade, increasing from $20 in 2003 to highs of $60 in 2008. Shares halved during the recession and steadily recovered to trade at all time highs around $84 earlier in Monday's trading session.Between 2009 and 2012, Thermo Fisher increased its revenues by little over a quarter from $9.9 billion to $12.5 billion. Net income increased by almost 40% to $1.18 billion in the meantime. Earnings per share increased even faster as the company retired roughly 14% of its shares outstanding over the past four years.Investment ThesisThe $76 offer made by Thermo Fisher is a knock-out offer and has already been approved by the board of directors of both the companies.The offer represents a roughly 25% premium over the share price level around $60 at the start of the year, when the company announced a strategic review of its future direction. Competing bids for Life Technologies came in from Sigma-Aldrich and a consortium from Blackstone and Carlyle, among others. This obviously drove up the price, but investors in Thermo Fisher appear to be relieved now a deal finally has gone through.The deal will increase annual revenues of Thermo Fisher by some 30% and increase earnings by some 36%, excluding synergy estimates. The price tag is pretty steep as the bidding war pushed up the price to 3.6 times annual revenues, a sizable 60-65% premium compared to Thermo Fisher's own valuation. The price tag values shares at 31-32 times annual earnings, a 35% premium compared to Thermo's own valuation.Yet the synergy estimates, exceeding $275 million per annum in three years time, make up a lot. Assuming statutory tax rates, after tax income could increase by roughly $175 million per annum valuing the deal at 21-22 times earnings.As a result of the deal, the net debt position of the combination will increase significantly. The current combined net debt position of $8.5 billion will increase by another $9.5-$10 billion following the deal, resulting in a sizable $18 billion net debt position. The remaining $4 billion will be financed by diluting Thermo Fisher's shareholder base by some 15%.The deal values the combined entity at roughly 2.0 times annual pro-forma revenues of $16.3 billion in 2012, and 20 times annual earnings of $1.6 billion. These are still steep valuations for a levered firm. Yet the new company will hold a strong position in the global market for genetic testing behind Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). If the deal will be executed correctly, the company could benefit from the faster growth in the gene market.The long term prospects look undoubtedly good, but shares have already been priced for perfection at high earnings multiples while the balance sheet will be highly leveraged. Investors should wait for the first quarter earnings report in little over a week, on the 24th of April, and carefully listen out to further clues from management about the impact of the deal on medium to long term earnings.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

671951,23502,2012-06-20T10:01:39-04:00,,"By Alex Morozov, CFAThermo Fisher's (NYSE:TMO)  customer approach is compelling to its customers. The company takes the  mundane work of inventory management, procurement, and other supply  chain management processes out of its laboratory customers' hands to  allow them to focus on research, while improving productivity and  providing them with savings. This approach has successfully worked with  biopharma clients, as Thermo Fisher's top pharma accounts have grown  north of company averages over the past few years. Now Thermo Fisher is  applying the same approach across other customer end markets. The  company is targeting industrial and academic clients with the same value  proposition, and considering the savings of the one-provider model with  global presence and robust product breadth, we believe it is a good  strategic partner for clients across the spectrum. We appreciate the  relative simplicity of the one-stop-shop approach, which has been a key  pillar to our moat assessment. The strength of this model is  particularly evident in Thermo Fisher's clinical trials logistics  segment, where the company is the leading provider of trial service  offerings. Thermo Fisher can support every step of a clinical trial,  from manufacturing of pharmaceuticals to storage and transportation.  This has resulted in virtually exclusive relationships with firms such  as Merck (NYSE:MRK), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), and others for trial support.Product Portfolio Positioned for Continued GrowthIn addition to the unmatched distribution infrastructure, the company  has a strong analytical product portfolio that further allows for client  penetration and cross-selling opportunities. Thermo Fisher has launched  a number of successful products over the past year, particularly in  mass spectrometry. The Q Exactive mass spectrometer launched this year  has already exceeded both the firm's and our initial expectations and is  on track to deliver more than $100 million in sales despite its hefty  price tag and challenging end market conditions. Thanks to the Dionex  acquisition, its new liquid chromatography offerings also have the  potential to improve Thermo Fisher's competitive standing. The company  points out that its research and development as a percentage of total  revenue has increased from 4.1% in 2009 to 4.7% targeted for  2012 -- although we note that a big portion of this increase is simply due  to a shift in mix aided by acquisitions.Bringing Dionex into the fold has been successful, with cost  synergies ($11 million) and market share gains due to cross-selling  opportunities ($14 million). The Phadia deal should also be accretive to  top-line growth and profitability over the long run, although the firm  is still in the early stages of bringing it into the fold and delivering  on its promise for return on invested capital. The market opportunity  is noteworthy, given the low penetration rate of in vitro allergy  testing and relatively minimal competition in this area. Thermo Fisher  highlighted its Procalcitonin, ImmunoCAP, and uKnow Peanut Molecular  Allergy tests as products in areas of high-growth and low competition.  However, the overall molecular diagnostics field is getting more  concentrated and more competitive. Being largely a niche assay provider,  Thermo Fisher does risk eventually running into competitors with more  robust offerings (including instrumentation). However, the company's  commitment to R&D and virtually unlimited appetite for acquisitions  should allow it to maintain its top-tier status across the board.China a Model for Thermo Fisher's Emerging-Market StrategyEmerging markets are an integral piece of the firm's strategy to  increase its top line and gain market share. These geographies currently  account for 19% of total revenue, up from 10% in 2006. Thermo Fisher  targets 25% of total sales to come from emerging markets in 2016,  implying mid-teens organic growth in these geographies. China has been  driving overall top-line growth, and the company now targets India,  South Korea, Brazil, and Russia as areas where it can successfully  implement the Chinese model and generate double-digit revenue growth. It  is important to note that China will still be a key component of  emerging markets expansion, particularly in the lipopolysaccharide and  diagnostics segments. Unlike government spending on infrastructure and  housing, Chinese investment in life sciences and health care is still  scheduled to grow at a double-digit clip, according to the latest  five-year plan, allowing companies already on the ground (particularly  Thermo Fisher) to capture the lion's share of this growth.Thermo Fisher points out its still minimal consumable presence in  these geographies (limited to high-end reagents) compared with legacy  Thermo Electron products that have been in this marketplace since the  1970s. A part of the problem, in our opinion, is the fragmented and  low-cost nature of the Chinese consumables market; Thermo Fisher is  addressing this by aggressively expanding the local manufacturing  infrastructure, such as the Suzhou facility scheduled to open in 2012. A  greater local presence should allow the firm to more effectively  compete with indigenous manufacturers. It should also support the  company's push toward low-cost region manufacturing to support its sales  efforts, with the goal to manufacture more than 50% of sales in China  locally. Eventually, it is possible that the company could move the bulk  of its manufacturing to emerging markets (it is also building out  facilities in India, Lithuania, and other countries), but given  logistical difficulties, low-cost region manufacturing will primarily be  used to serve local markets.This does give the firm another lever to pull to improve its  operating margins, though. Nearly 11% of total manufacturing revenue in  2011 was from low-cost regions, up from 5% in 2007, and every $100  million of moved production saves the company $20 million. However, the  magnitude of these savings from manufacturing shifts is not likely to be  fully reflected in Thermo's margins, given the pricing dynamic in  emerging markets. While the company suggests that its margins in  emerging markets are similar to corporate averages, this can be  explained by a greater percentage of revenue in the form of high-margin  instrumentation. As low-margin consumables gain more traction, this will  counter some of these manufacturing-related margin gains. However, it  does benefit the overall cost structure, in addition to productivity  improvement measures.On Track for Improving Margins, Double-Digit Near-Term GrowthThe company's record of margin improvement is stellar, averaging 70  basis points per year since 2006, and its forecast for 2012 calls for  another 70-90 basis points of expansion (once again, some of this is a  simple mix shift benefit). While the company hasn't offered an update to  its 2012 forecast or provided 2013 guidance, it did suggest that it  should deliver double-digit earnings per share growth in 2013,  sequestration budget cuts or not. This should soothe some investors who  are worried about the impact of an academic spending pullback on the  company's earnings growth.Several factors are likely to mitigate any sequestration-related  headwinds, from revenue as well as cost perspectives. First, the  company's total direct exposure to the National Institutes of Health is  about 5% of total sales. Second, while the indirect exposure via  academic spending is substantially higher (global government and  academic spending accounts for roughly one fourth of total sales), the  sequestration effect has more or less already been factored into  academia purchasing decisions. The NIH budget for 2012 was 1% higher  than the previous year, yet total spending by academic and government  end markets is down by mid-single digits, suggesting that these customers  aren't waiting for the September decision on the 2013 NIH budget to  adjust their budgets. Thus, the proposed roughly 8% reduction isn't  going to be as punitive on suppliers as it appears. Thermo Fisher has  felt the effect since the third quarter of 2011 (the pullback actually  caught the firm by surprise and the stock has been punished  accordingly), so we anticipate the effect will be significantly  mitigated. Further, revenue growth is aided by the steadily climbing  presence of high-growth emerging markets in the mix. Finally, a bulk of  the company's total cost structure is variable in nature, allowing  Thermo Fisher to minimize the effect of a revenue pullback on its  margins and earnings. The latest example of the levers the firm can pull  is its 2009 performance, where adjusted operating margins slipped only  100 basis points despite a 4% top-line decline.The company's five-year guidance is admirable: mid-single-digit  top-line growth, 50-100 basis points of adjusted margin growth (reaching  22%-23% by 2016), and earnings per share of $7.50-$8.75, implying  midteens growth per year. A sizable chunk of EPS growth is due to some  financial engineering, including buybacks, a product shift mix to  lower-tax locales, and a shrinking debt load. However, Thermo Fisher's  long-term adjusted operating margin improvement targets are reasonable  and just ahead of our expectation for a 40-basis-point improvement on  average.We do find Thermo Fisher's adjusted expectations for return on  invested capital (60-70 basis points of improvement per year) a bit  misleading, given that these targets don't incorporate any acquisitions,  which have been the company's modus operandi for more than a decade. A  capital allocation strategy heavily geared toward acquisitions has  resulted in suppressed ROICs, but the company is finally in economic  profit territory, having reached ROICs north of 9% (its cost of capital  is roughly 9%, using the current leverage level). We're still not  convinced the company's acquisition strategy is the most accretive use  of capital to ROICs. We also view acquisitions as the main  company-specific factor contributing to the lackluster stock performance  over the past five years. However, we think the company is likely to  take a pause with acquisitions over the next 12 months or so, small  tuck-ins notwithstanding. We think the company will probably spend the  next 12 months de-leveraging its balance sheet. The recent dividend  initiation is yet another sign of the slight alteration of the firm's  capital allocation strategy, historically evenly split between buybacks  and acquisitions.We think a less aggressive usage of capital over the past five years  would have been welcomed by investors. Nonetheless, we remain bullish on  the shares, as we think Thermo Fisher's long-term earnings growth  potential --driven by strengthening competitive positioning and the  growing penetration of higher-value-added products and geographies -- is  under-appreciated.Disclosure: Morningstar licenses its indexes  to certain ETF and ETN providers, including BlackRock, Invesco, Merrill  Lynch, Northern Trust, and Scottrade for use in exchange-traded funds  and notes.

Our analysis focuses on the company’s performance for the same quarterly period on a year-on-year basis (unless stated otherwise).HighlightsThe table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income (See complete table at the end of this report):Revenue Growth Versus Earnings GrowthCompanies sometimes focus on growing their top-line (Sales or Revenues) more than their bottom-line i.e. Earnings or Net Income. Investors should look at revenue growth to understand a company’s ability to grow its market share, and earnings growth to look at the company’s ability to generate returns. Comparing revenue growth to earnings growth helps understand a couple of items: (1) A company’s focus on gaining market share vs. generating profits and (2) How additive or dilutive the revenue performance has been to earnings.TMO-US’s year-on-year change in top line compared to the same period last year of 30.69% trailed its change in earnings which was 47.37%. The company’s performance this period suggests a focus on boosting the bottom-line earnings. While the revenue performance could be higher, it is important to note that this change in revenues is among the highest in the peer group thus far. Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by -3.48% and earnings by 68.11% compared to the immediate last quarter.Earnings Growth AnalysisThe company’s earnings growth has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Year-on-year improvements in gross margins from 50.06% to 51.27% and (2) better cost controls. As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) improved from 21.22% to 24.14% year-on-year. In addition, gross margins were 56.32% and EBITDA margins 23.40% in the immediate last quarter.Operating Cash Flow Growth Versus Earnings GrowthCompanies often post earnings numbers that are influenced by non-cash activities. One way to gauge the quality of the declared earnings number is to judge the deviation in the growth in earnings from the growth in operating cash flows. In general, an earnings growth rate that is higher compared to the operating cash flow growth implies a higher proportion of non-operating and even one-time activities – such activities are typically not sustainable over long periods.TMO-US’s year-on-year change in Operating Cash Flow of 33.73% trailed its change in earnings suggesting that the earnings number might have benefited from some unlocking of accruals. On a positive note, this change in Operating Cash Flow was better than the average among the declared results thus far in its peer group.Unusual ItemsThe company’s EBIT margins declined and went from from 13.37% to 13.22%. In spite of this, the company’s earnings went up – influenced primarily by the presence of unusual items, which improved pretax margins from 9.99% to 12.93%.EPS Growth Versus Earnings GrowthTMO-US’s year-on-year change in Earnings per Share (NYSEARCA:EPS) of 35.31% is less than its change in earnings of 47.37%. This lower EPS growth suggests a likely larger dilution in the company’s shares this period. However, on the positive side, this change in earnings is better than average among the declared results thus far in its peer group suggesting that the company is gaining more ground in generating profits in this group.Supporting DataThe table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and other relevant metrics:Company ProfileThermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. provides analytical instruments, equipment, reagents and consumables, software and services for research, analysis, discovery and diagnostics.

257778,23478,2011-03-11T12:03:57-05:00,,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., (NYSE:TMO), the nation’s biggest laboratory supply company, reliably churns out cash in good times and bad.At the same time that Thermo profit were under a bit of pressure from the economy’s meltdown, the Massachusetts, company used its impressive free cash flow to go on a shopping spree over the past couple years.It paid a combined $1.25 billion to snap up about a dozen smaller companies. Then in December it announced a richly priced $2.1 billion cash deal for California instrument maker Dionex (NASDAQ:DNEX).Thermo also spent a billion dollars last year buying back its own shares, and has authorization to spend a bit more on Thermo buybacks again this year. Despite all the money going out the door, both major credit rating concerns recently bumped the company’s investment-grade debt a notch higher.And Thermo’s PE ratio, after slumming for a while in the wake of the market’s crash, has lately been climbing back up to its historically plush levels.Until very recently, YCharts considered Thermo cheap. Now, with the stock’s recovery so well advanced, YCharts says it is correctly priced.We are probably being overly conservative. Despite its recent rebound, the stock could move significantly higher. Stable end markets and cost-cutting efforts let Thermo deliver solid profits through tough times.  Now, as markets strengthen, future profit margins — helped by an offshore growth strategy and the recent acquisitions — are likely to exceed earlier peak-profit levels.Thermo was itself formed through a late-2006 merger that combined a company that specialized in big-ticket diagnostic and research equipment (like mass spectrometers) and a supplier focused on recession-resistant but less profitable science “consumables” (like test tubes and lab beakers).The result was that rarest of things: a merger that actually creates the hoped-for synergies. Thermo has been gaining market share because its broad line of products allows pharmaceutical makers, university research labs, healthcare providers and other science clients it serves to consolidate their purchases.Thermo’s market cap became big enough to catch the attention of more investors.Research budgets aren’t immune to the economy, of course, but they’re a lot less volatile than, say, demand for new cars or laptop computers. That explains why Thermo’s sales and margins tend to hold up so well during bad times.And the company is still streamlining:last week, Thermo agreed to sell a couple diagnostic operations — profitable but non-core businesses picked up as part of the 2006 merger — for a bigger-than-expected $740 million in cash.The problem, of course, is that “stable” markets tend to be slow-growing. That’s certainly the case among Thermo’s client base in Europe and North America, although the company managed to record high-single-digit revenue growth last year. Future revenue gains will most likely come from the laboratory-product maker’s accelerating push into the rapidly expanding science and tech markets of China and India, however.Along with those positives, there’s a reason for caution: Many of Thermo’s leading customers are pharmaceutical makers, where wide-open R&D spending is a tradition. Although repeated mergers have trimmed the number of major drug makers, overall research spending has held up. While the mega-players continue to spend heavily on research, however, their new size gives them more purchasing muscle when buying lab equipment: Thermo may face more price resistance.Even with that possibility on the horizon — and even though little-known Thermo is currently sporting a multiple twice that of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) – it’s still a solid play for investors who favor consistent profits and upside potential.Disclosure: None"

Illumina markets research tools and integrated systems for use in genetic variation analysis.Shares of the company, which had already been cut in half since July, fell 31.93% Friday to close at $27.18. Governments are looking for ways to cut spending as the pace of the worldwide economic recovery grinds to a halt, ""and the weakness in demand (for medical research tools and systems) may continue as the U.S. government ... mulls the research budget for agencies including the National Institutes of Health."" This is a problem for Illumina given that it derives 80% of its revenue from government-backed research funding.What is worth noting is the collateral damage caused by Illumina's announcement. Shares of competing medical research product companies suffered outsized losses Friday on the back of Illumina's gloomy forecast. Notably, shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) lost 6% Friday. While the shares have rebounded today (Monday) as part of a broad-based relief rally, they will likely slump again soon as jubilation over European bank recapitalization plans fades and investors refocus on the dismal outlook for research spending. If this happens, Thermo Fisher looks to be a best-of-breed company worth buying on weakness, especially given that it only derives around 5% of its revenue from NIH funding.Thermo Fisher, which carries a five star rating from S&P, develops and manufactures equipment, instruments and software for application in scientific research, diagnosis and discovery. According to S&P's stock report, TMO should be able to overcome the challenges presented by the weak economy by virtue of its extensive line of products and aggressive expansion into China and various emerging markets where S&P sees substantial and continuing growth. The company is adept at increasing shareholder value by way of its various stock repurchase programs - the company returned around $1.5 billion to shareholders in 2010.Moreover, TMO has far less debt than its competitors as a percentage of long-term capital. TMO's long-term debt-to-cap ratio is only 11.7% compared to 18% for Perkin Elmer, 36.3% for Life Technologies, and 39.6% for Waters Corp. It has more cash than Perkin Elmer and Life Tech and as much cash as Waters, although Waters turns a higher percentage of its revenue into net income.Compared to competitors, Thermo Fisher is a giant. The company's sales were nearly $11 billion in 2010 compared to $1.64 billion for competitor Waters Corp. and $3.59 billion for Life Technologies Corp. This large gap between the sales generated by TMO and those generated by its competitors lead S&P to conclude that the company will likely enjoy a comparative advantage over its competitors regarding purchasing power and operating leverage.Regardless of the downturn in research funding, analysts estimate TMO's 2012 earnings at $4.92 per share - that means TMO traded at just 10.26 times forward earnings after Friday's sell-off.

However, after adjusting for certain one-time items, the EPS was 87 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents and 19% higher than 73 cents in the year-ago quarter.Growth in all the divisions of Life Technologies helped adjusted revenues increase 8% year over year to $869 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $857 million. Excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenues grew 6% and 9% after excluding the previous year’s impact of H1N1 and the large Japanese forensic order.On a geographical basis, barring Japan where revenues declined 1%, revenue growth was witnessed across all other regions: Europe – 5%, Asia-Pacific – 7% and the Americas – 8%. Although revenues increased 8%, EPS was higher by 19% due to an improvement in operating margin (29% compared with the year-ago quarter’s 27.3%), lower interest expense (27.7%), lower adjusted tax rate (25.8% versus 29.1%), partially offset by a 22.4% rise in the share count.Following the release of third-quarter results, Life increased its EPS guidance for fiscal 2010 to $3.48–$3.52 from the previous guidance of $3.35–$3.50. In addition, organic revenue during the fourth quarter is expected to increase in the mid-single digits.For a full coverage on the earnings, read: hereEstimate Revision TrendsIn accordance with the company’s current outlook, the recent Zacks Consensus Estimate revision trends remain positive for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011. However, estimate revision trends for the next two quarters is mixed. Over the past 30 days, while 7 analysts have lowered their estimates, 5 have moved in the opposite direction.Over the past 30 days, 14 of the 16 analysts covering the stock have raised their estimates for fiscal 2010 without any movement in the opposite direction. The positive trend persists for fiscal 2011 as well with 12 analysts raising their estimates, with only 1 moving in the opposite direction.Life Technologies’ existing business segments continue to impress with their strong performance, which prompted the analysts to raise their outlook. Since 2007, EPS has grown at CAGR of 20% from $2.03 to the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.51 for 2010. Moreover, free cash flow has more than doubled over the same period. Over the last two years, the company has been trying to create the optimal portfolio of products through innovations and acquisitions, the latest being Ion Torrent. The company derives 20% of revenues from proprietary instruments, which in turn drive the demand for high-margin consumables that account for the remaining 80%. Higher proportion of high margin consumables helps to generate significant free cash flow on a consistent basis.The strong balance sheet of Life is also encouraging as it is focused on debt repayment, suitable acquisitions and share buyback programs. The company achieved its targeted leverage of 2x to 2.5x EBITDA during the third quarter of 2010. The company has adopted several strategies during the third quarter including completion of the European back-office consolidation, site consolidations in Asia, and the placement of approximately 90 dual-branded supply centers worldwide. These steps have resulted in $25 million of synergies during the quarter. We note that adjusted operating margin during the quarter improved 170 bps to 29% driven by acquisition related synergies and cost controls implemented during the quarter.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThe magnitude of estimate revisions for the forthcoming quarters has been modest. In the past 30 days, estimates for the fourth quarter remained unchanged while estimates for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 have increased by a penny to 92 cents. Moreover, estimates for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 have increased by 9 cents to $3.51 and 5 cents to $3.84, respectively, in the past 30 days.RecommendationLife Technologies Corporation enjoys a strong position in the life sciences market and we believe robust performance from its core business along with new product launches will help drive revenues going forward. Meanwhile, lower expenses and cost cutting along with increased revenues should help drive the bottom line. Additionally, the company is shifting its focus on emerging markets that bode well for long term growth. We are also impressed by Life’s focus on stem cell research, which holds immense potential in the long term. Although the economy is gradually recovering, any kind of hiccups in the process will affect the company. Moreover, Life is highly exposed to the fluctuations of foreign currency movement.For the long term, we have a “Neutral” rating on Life Tech.

For fiscal 2010, adjusted EPS  came in at $3.55, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.51 and the  previous year’s  EPS of $3.04.Growth in all the divisions of Life Technologies helped adjusted  revenues for the quarter increase 7% year over year to $934 million,  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $928 million. Excluding the  impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenues grew 5%. For  the full year, the company reported a 9% growth in adjusted revenue to  $3.6 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.On a geographical basis, barring Japan where revenues declined 4%  compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, revenue growth was  witnessed across all other regions: Europe – 3%, Asia-Pacific – 12% and  the Americas – 7%.The recent Zacks Consensus Estimate revision trends remain positive for  fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011. Over the past 30 days, 11 of the 17  analysts covering the stock have raised their estimates for fiscal 2011  while 2 analysts have moved in the opposite direction. The positive  trend persists for fiscal 2012 as well with 9 analysts raising their  estimates, without any downward movement.However, the estimate revision trend for the first two quarters is  negative. Over the past 30 days, 7 and 6 analysts have lowered their  estimates for the first and second quarters, respectively with only 1  analyst doing the reverse in each case. The pessimism for the first half  primarily comes due to flat-to-5% decline in projected revenue stemming  from difficult year-over-year comparisons and unfavorable currency  movement.Organic growth in the first quarter of 2010 was 10% as a result of  stimulus programs in the US and Japan and the receipt of the last  installment of the Japanese Police order. Life Technologies’ existing business segments continue to impress with  their strong performance, which prompted the analysts to raise their  outlook. Since 2007, EPS has grown at a CAGR of 20% from $2.03 to the  current level of $3.55 in 2010. Over the last two years, the company has  been trying to create the optimal portfolio of products through  innovations and acquisitions, the latest being Ion Torrent.One of the key growth drivers for Life has been product innovation, as a  result of which several launches were made during 2010. The  bio-production business recorded a robust growth of more than 20% driven  by the successful launch of several new products.Key product launches in other areas include sample preparation,  real-time PCR, bench-time devices and sequencing. The company has  increased its market share in the real-time PCR business, which  witnessed a 12% growth in 2010 (excluding H1N1 related sales), up from  9% in 2009. The acquisition of Stokes Bio in 2010 has strengthened this  business further.Life Technologies is adopting several strategies, which are expected to  improve its operating efficiency going ahead. The company recorded  adjusted operating margin of 28.7% in 2010 (up 210 basis points) and is  targeting to achieve margins in excess of 31% in 2013. While half of  this improvement should come from fixed cost leverage (115 basis  points), manufacturing productivity and supply chain efficiencies should  account for the rest.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThe magnitude of estimate revisions for the forthcoming quarters has  been significant. In the past 30 days, estimates for the first and  second quarters have declined by 5 cents to 88 cents and 3 cents to 97  cents, respectively. While estimates for the first two quarters have  declined, the opposite trend can be witnessed for fiscal 2011 and 2012.  Estimates for the two years have increased by 4 cents to $3.89 and 8  cents to $4.32, respectively, in the past 30 days.RecommendationLife Technologies enjoys a strong position in the life sciences market  and we believe robust performance from its core business along with new  product launches will help drive revenues going forward.

252949,20568,2011-02-15T12:38:35-05:00,,"Subsequent to the announcement of Thermo Fisher Scientific’s (NYSE:TMO)  fourth quarter and fiscal 2010 results on February 2, 2011, revision of  estimates among analysts depict a positive trend for both fiscal 2011  and fiscal 2012.Previous quarter HighlightsThermo Fisher reported an adjusted EPS of $1.00 in the fourth quarter  of fiscal 2010, surpassing both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents  and the year-ago quarter’s 91 cents. For the full year, the company  reported a 17% growth in EPS to $3.57, beating the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $3.52.The company’s revenue of $2.78 billion during the quarter was in line  with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.8 billion and 2% lower than  $2.84 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. While acquisitions  had a positive impact of 2% on revenues, unfavorable currency movement  had a negative impact of 1%. For fiscal 2010, Thermo Fisher recorded a  7% growth in revenues to $10.79 billion, almost in line with the Zacks  Consensus Estimate of $10.80 billion.The decline in fourth quarter revenue was expected due to the  termination of the Biosite contract, difficult flu comparison and fewer  calendar days. Despite a decline in revenues, Thermo Fisher’s EPS  increased because of improvement in both gross and operating margins,  33% lower interest expense and a 5.5% decline in the share count.We believe that having been encouraged by the various strategies  adopted by Thermo Fisher and a gradual improvement in its end markets,  analysts are bullish about the company’s performance for both fiscal  2011 and 2012. Out of 16 analysts covering the stock, 13 have raised  their estimates for fiscal 2011 in the past 30 days with only 1 doing  the reverse. A similar trend can be witnessed for fiscal 2011 with 11  analysts raising their estimates in the past 30 days with no movement in  the opposite direction.However, the situation is a bit different for the first quarter of  fiscal 2011 as 6 analysts have reduced their estimates in the past 30  days with 1 upward revision. This is because the first half of 2011 will  face difficult comparison as a result of the termination of the Biosite  contract and stimulus revenue received from Japan.Thermo Fisher’s adjusted operating margin improved by 310 basis points  to 17.8% in 2010 from 2006. This was possible due to the adoption of  Practical Process Improvement (PPI) program, tight cost control on  discretionary spending and infrastructure optimization that included  reduced footprint and expanded low-cost region (NYSEARCA:LCR) manufacturing  (China, Mexico and Eastern Europe). Revenue from LCR locations in 2010  was $480 million which is expected to cross $550 million in 2011.Thermo Fisher has strong international operations and derived 40% of  its revenues in fiscal 2010 from the international market. Within the  Asian market, the company is focusing on China and India, both of which  recorded more than 20% growth in the fourth quarter. During the quarter,  China became the company’s third largest country in terms of revenue  behind the US and Germany. Thermo Fisher views strong potential in China  based on rapid industrialization, increasing focus on healthcare, new  BioPharma R&D centers and government sponsored research.The company also plans to expand its commercial operations in Brazil,  which is the eighth largest economy in the world. Subsequent to its  decision to acquire Dionex (NASDAQ:DNEX), revenue contribution from emerging markets should increase based on Dionex’s high exposure in these regions.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThe magnitude of estimate revisions for the next two quarters has been  modest. In the past 30 days, estimate for the first quarter has dropped  by 2 cents to 92 cents while estimate for the second quarter of 2011 has  gone up by a penny. Moreover, estimates for fiscal years 2011 and 2012  have increased by 7 cents to $4.09 and 11 cents to $4.50, respectively,  in the past 30 days.RecommendationA gradual improvement in the economic scenario along with its focus on  potential markets and other strategies should drive Thermo Fisher’s top  line in the forthcoming period. Moreover, the company’s strong cash  position should assist in making suitable acquisitions, reduce debt  burden or repurchase shares. As a result, the Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) is  based on the near-term outlook of the company.Although economic recovery is reflected through improved performance,  the company still witnesses pricing pressure, though modest. Moreover,  economic turbulence could negatively impact the company’s sales due to  financial constraints and customers deferring their buying decisions.  Weighing these factors, over the long term, we are “Neutral” on the  stock."

Ion's innovative DNA sequencing technology, the acquisition's main win, casts aside many of the most expensive components used by other modern sequencers in favor of cheaper semiconductor technology.   “We believe Ion Torrent’s technology will represent a profound change for the life sciences industry,” says Life Technologies CEO, Gregory Lucier.   “By leveraging the cumulative $1 trillion already invested in semiconductor research and development, we believe that Ion Torrent will drive unprecedented scalability, delivering the solution required for future generations of sequencing,” says Lucier.   Ion's first sequencing system, the sub-$100,000 Personal Genome Machine, targets mid-scale sequencing projects and will supplement the lineup of more expensive laser-and-optics driven sequencers which Life Technologies already sells under the Applied Biosystems brand.   In addition to the $375 million in cash and stock the company will initially pay for Ion, it may also deliver up to an additional $350 million should the company achieve a series of technical and time-based milestones through 2012. Life Technologies is financing the transaction with cash on hand, available lines of credit, and stock.   The acquisition makes Jonathan Rothberg, Ion's founder, a multiple winner in the buyout sweepstakes. After founding 454 Life Sciences in 2000, he sold it to Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) in 2007.

236500,20568,2010-11-12T08:41:52-05:00,,"Subsequent to the announcement of Thermo Fisher Scientific’s (TMO)  third quarter fiscal 2010 results on October 27, 2010, revision of  estimates among analysts depict a positive trend for both fiscal 2010  and 2011.Third Quarter HighlightsThermo Fisher reported an EPS of 66 cents in the third quarter of  fiscal 2010 compared to 53 cents in the year-ago period. However, after  adjusting for certain one-time items, the EPS was 90 cents, way above  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents and 15% higher than 78 cents in  the third quarter of 2009. The company reported a 6% annualized growth  in revenues to $2.68 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $2.59 billion. Strong growth in instruments, equipment and  clinical diagnostics and biosciences businesses led to the growth.A strong quarter ensures that Thermo Fisher will be able to meet its  earnings growth outlook for 2010. The company increased its revenue and  adjusted EPS guidance to $10.72 - $10.80 billion, representing an  annualized growth of 6% - 7% (previous guidance of $10.60 - $10.75  billion) and $3.47 - $3.53, representing a 14% - 16% growth ($3.40 -  $3.50 earlier), respectively.While revenue guidance has been increased due to improved foreign  currency translation and better-than-expected organic growth during the  third quarter, adjusted EPS was raised due to higher revenues,  increasing share buyback program and slightly lower tax rate.For a full coverage on the earnings, read here.Estimate Revision TrendsSubsequent to the announcement of strong third quarter results and an  encouraging outlook, analysts have raised their estimates for both  fiscal 2010 and 2011. However, the situation is a bit different for the  fourth quarter as 8 analysts have reduced their estimates in the past 30  days with 3 upward revisions.The fourth quarter of 2010 will be difficult for Thermo Fisher due to  the presence of certain issues. The company had four more calendar days  during the first quarter of 2010 (compared to 2009), which had a  positive impact of 4-5%. As a result, there will be a comparable  opposite impact in the fourth quarter. Additional headwinds consist of  the termination of the Biosite contract (effective July 1, 2010) and a  strong flu season in 2009 compared to the expectation of a normal flu  this year. These two events are expected to negatively impact full year  revenue growth by over 1%. Contract termination, difficult flu  comparison and fewer calendar days are expected to hit the fourth  quarter growth by about 6 percentage points, resulting in reported  organic growth of -3% to -1%. However, on adjusting for these headwinds,  organic growth guidance during the quarter would be 3% - 5%.We note that having been encouraged by the various strategies adopted  by Thermo Fisher and a gradual improvement in its end markets, analysts  are bullish about the company’s performance in the forthcoming period.  For both the fiscals, 14 analysts have raised their estimates over the  past 30 days without any downward revisions. One analyst has raised  his/her estimate for fiscal 2010 during the week.Thermo Fisher has strong international operations and derived 39% of  its revenues in fiscal 2009 from the international market. Within the  Asian market, the company is focusing on China and India, both of which  holds immense potential. The company’s focus on these regions is evident  from the robust growth in their revenues. Bookings were stronger than  revenues in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China and India,  where double-digit growth was recorded. Based on strong booking  momentum, the company expects the Asian market to be the fastest growing  geography going ahead.Thermo Fisher’s focus on improving its product portfolio and developing  newer technologies should enable it to record growth going ahead.  During the third quarter of 2010, Thermo Fisher stepped up R&D spend  by 30 basis points (2.7% of revenues) to expand its pipeline of new  technologies.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThe magnitude of estimate revisions for the next two quarters has been  modest. In the past 30 days, estimate for the fourth quarter has dropped  by 1 cent while estimate for the first quarter of 2011 has gone up by 1  cent. Moreover, estimates for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 have increased  by 4 cents to $3.52 and 10 cents to $3.97, respectively, in the past 30  days.RecommendationAfter a drop in revenues during 2009, Thermo Fisher is back on the  growth trajectory. A gradual improvement in the economic scenario along  with its focus on potential markets and other strategies should drive  its top line in the forthcoming period. Moreover, Thermo Fisher’s strong  cash position should assist in making suitable acquisitions, reduce  debt burden or repurchase shares. As a result, the Zacks #2 Rank (Buy)  is based on the near-term outlook of the company.Although economic recovery is reflected through improved performance,  the company still witnesses pricing pressure, though modest.

232419,20568,2010-10-26T16:06:20-04:00,,"Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)  is scheduled to report its third quarter fiscal 2010 results before the  market opens on Wednesday, October 27, 2010. The company is expected to  earn 83 cents (representing an increase of 6.4% from the year-ago  quarter’s 78 cents) on revenues of $2.59 billion, according to the Zacks  Consensus Estimate.Barring the second quarter of fiscal 2010, Thermo Fisher has surpassed  expectations in the last three quarters with a four-quarter positive  surprise of 5.57%. This means that the company has beaten the Zacks  Consensus Estimate by this magnitude over the last four quarters. Based  on this favorable trend, there is a high probability that the company  will exceed estimates in the upcoming quarter.Following second quarter results, the company maintained its adjusted  EPS guidance of $3.40-$3.50, representing a growth of 11% - 15% over  2009. However, unfavorable currency movements forced Thermo Fisher to  lower its revenue guidance to $10.60-$10.75 billion from the previous  guidance of $10.65-$10.80 billion. The company did not provide any  guidance for the third quarter. Previous Quarter HighlightsThermo Fisher reported an EPS of 57 cents in the second quarter of 2010  compared to 49 cents in the year-ago period. However, after adjusting  for certain one-time items, the EPS was 84 cents, meeting the Zacks  Consensus Estimate and 14% higher than the second quarter of 2009.The company reported revenues of $2.65 billion, up 7% compared to the  year-ago quarter. Acquisitions had a positive impact of 3% on revenues  while unfavorable currency movement brought down revenues by 1%.  Reported revenues narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.67  billion.Agreement of Analysts Revisions in estimates for the third and fourth quarters have been  mixed over the past month. Out of the 15 analysts covering the stock, 2  analysts each have revised their earnings estimates in opposite  directions. A similar trend can be witnessed in the past week, where  estimates were revised by 1 analyst each in both upward and downward  directions. For fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, 2 analysts have increased  their estimates without any revision in the opposite direction.  During the previous quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed constrained  capital spending in the biopharma market, particularly due to mergers  and acquisitions, a trend that was expected to continue in the third  quarter. Moreover, the situation in the pharmaceutical market was tough  as pharmaceutical companies’ spending declined driven by consolidation  of facilities.While the company witnessed acceleration from the global stimulus  program, the situation in the healthcare market remained soft due to a  decline in doctor and hospital visits along with a weak flu season.Thermo Fisher had provided a detailed outlook for the second half of  2010, which is supposed to be difficult due to the presence of certain  issues. The company had four more calendar days during the first quarter  of 2010 (compared to 2009), which had a positive impact of 4-5% on  revenues.As a result, there will be a comparable opposite impact in the fourth  quarter. Additional headwinds consist of the termination of the Biosite  contract (effective July 1, 2010), which is likely to hit second half  revenues by approximately $55 million. The flu season was strong in 2009  compared to the expectation of a normal flu this year ($20 million  impact). Both of these items will impact the third quarter more than the  fourth.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThere have been no estimate revisions for the third quarter over the  past 7 or 60 days. However, estimates for the quarter and fiscal 2010  have gone down by a penny over the past 3 months. The current Zacks  Consensus Estimate for 2010 is $3.46, reflecting year-over-year growth  of 13.4%. RecommendationA gradual improvement in the economic scenario along with the focus on  emerging markets should drive Thermo Fisher’s top line in the  forthcoming period. However, we remain concerned about the company’s  exposure to foreign exchange risk, since it derived about 39% of its  fiscal 2009 revenues from international operations.Moreover, any kind of economic turbulence resulting from financial  constraints or deferrals in buying decisions of customers could  negatively impact the company’s sales.We are currently Neutral on the stock, which corresponds to a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold)."

Value  Line assigns TMO a 'B++' financial strength rating. Value Line also notes  Thermo's 95th percentile rankings for both 'earnings predictability'  and 'stock price growth persistence'. These shares have outperformed 95% of the  1700 company Value Line stock  universe over the past decade.At Friday's quote of $31.45,  TMO shares are offered at just 10x this year's expected EPS of $3.14 and under  9x next year's estimate of $3.50.This is the lowest  valuation for Thermo Fisher Scientific on record. Its 10-year median P/E has  been 24x and Value Line is assuming an 18 multiple for its 3–5 year  normalized projections.TMO shares look to be a  fine example of GARP (Growth at a Reasonable Price). This is a high-quality  growth story at a decidedly non-premium price point right  now.Even 12 times next year's  consensus view of $3.50 EPS would bring TMO shares back to $42 or + 33.5% from Friday's price. That's a very low ball target as these shares touched highs of  $46.30, $62, and $62.80 in 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively when fundamentals  were nowhere near as good as they are today.Disclosure: Author bought  shares of TMO on Friday."

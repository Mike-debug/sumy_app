4371958,95916,2020-09-01T13:51:51-04:00,"T-Mobile can be valued two ways: as a member of a stable wireless oligopoly or as a player in a competitive industry.In a competitive industry, the less lucrative of the two, spectrum is the lifeblood of wireless.T-Mobile has just acquired spectrum at a steep discount in the Sprint merger.T-Mobile's build-out requirements pose minimal threat to this upside.Even in the less lucrative competitive scenario, T-Mobile is now worth no less than $172 per share.","Following final approval and execution of the T-Mobile (TMUS) merger with Sprint, investors must now choose between two interpretations of the merger’s significance for the wireless industry. The first is that almost a decade of wireless price wars have come to an end and T-Mobile has now secured a one-third share of a nearly complete oligopoly, i.e., an oligopoly that has almost complete control of the entire market between its respective members.The second is that T-Mobile has just acquired a treasure trove of new spectrum to deploy and continue its pro-consumer Un-Carrier revolution with, perhaps in the areas of video and music as well as mobile Internet service. While this is undoubtedly the less lucrative of the two choices for T-Mobile, even that interpretation means T-Mobile is significantly undervalued. I am remaining long and setting a new price target of $172 per share, assuming a competitive industry dynamic.In valuing wireless companies in a competitive industry setting - which the US industry may or may not be anymore - I’ve often used spectrum as a proxy for underlying value. The reason is that spectrum is as essential to wireless companies as oil reserves are to shale drillers. Each wireless company can only have as many customers as it has spectrum to support their needs.In other words, the most a wireless company can hope to do is fully utilize the wireless spectrum it has on its books. When it runs out of radio waves to carry data over, it hits its profit ceiling - even if there are more customers willing to leave competitors and join the carrier.It’s true that wireless carriers in the US have at times willingly underutilized their networks to produce pricing power over consumers data use and extract monopoly/oligopoly profits from them. But profit-maximizing carriers will only do that if throttling consumers data consumption yields more profit than maximizing it.So the derived value of a company’s spectrum essentially acts as a floor on the value of the company. If an oligopoly, enforced by throttling data usage, ever ceases to deliver the outsized profits that were promised, a wireless carrier can always go back to consumer-friendly data management practices instead, and grow its profit up to the profit ceiling that its spectrum position allows.With that in mind, because there are differences of opinion over whether T-Mobile is now entering a new oligopoly phase or intends to continue as a market disruptor, I am going to base my new price target on its spectrum position and assume it intends to adopt the less lucrative course of remaining a disruptor. Any benefits from oligopoly will only take the price target I calculate even higher.Because I’ve already done some pre-merger analysis of T-Mobile, I am not going to do a valuation exercise from scratch. Instead, I am going to take my pre-merger price target for the company - which T-Mobile has already hit - and simply add onto it the additional benefits of the merger.Back in early 2017, I had calculated that T-Mobile warranted a price target of $108 per share, assuming that it did not suffer a spectrum crunch - code for network congestion issues which degrade the user experience. While I will admit I have consistently underestimated the T-Mobile engineering team’s prowess, the acquisition of Sprint’s treasure trove off spectrum means that any spectrum crunch concerns have been officially buried, to the extent that CTO Neville Ray hadn’t buried them already.With T-Mobile having outperformed the S&P index 98% to 54% since then to hit that target, the question then becomes how much of a hike is warranted by its new spectrum acquisitions.Just prior to the merger, T-Mobile reported it had roughly 857 million shares outstanding. The merger then converted Sprint’s 4.11 billion shares at a 9.75 to 1 ratio, producing roughly 421 million new T-Mobile shares. After that happened, SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY) surrendered 48 million of those new shares back to the company, for no extra compensation, to bring its own exchange ratio up to 11.3 to 1. Altogether, with SoftBank owning some 85% of Sprint pre-merger, the overall merger ratio increased to roughly 11:1.In exchange for that now-less-than 33% dilution, the new company has secured roughly 200 MHz of new spectrum from the Sprint holdings. In analyzing the 2.5 GHz holdings alone, I calculated a value for them of somewhere around $100 billion before deducting Sprint’s debt, which New T-Mobile will also be assuming. The net benefit to T-Mobile is around $67 billion, minimum. With around 1.23 billion shares outstanding after SoftBank’s rebate, that spectrum should boost T-Mobile’s fair value by around $54 per share. Then there are another 35 MHz or so of mid-band spectrum. I will conservatively assume these add only another $10 per share of value. Altogether, combined with my original $108 calculation, T-Mobile’s fair value is now no less than $172 per share.The one fly in the ointment here might be thought to be the costs of rural expansion. Under the merger deal, the FCC required New T-Mobile to offer 5G service to 85% of rural residents in the US within three years. That kind of rural build-out can substantially burden a wireless company, especially one using high-band 2.5 GHz TDD technology as T-Mobile does, because rural areas offer far fewer residents over which to spread the fixed costs of each tower, and high-band can’t travel very far, necessitating a high number of towers. Most rural coverage comes at some sort of loss, funded by urban residents and the profit streams gleaned from them. 2.5 GHz would require higher subsidies still.I don’t see a need to deduct from the number I have calculated, however, because the FCC’s requirement, while sounding very bold and potentially expensive, is actually rather toothless. In the first place, the FCC’s proposal does not actually give rise to a private cause of action, so if New T-Mobile fails to meet its promise or even just flat out ignored it, rural residents would not have the right to seek any actual compensation.If New T-Mobile were required to pay the cost to substitute any service to rural residents it failed to deliver with an alternative provider, that might be different. Emphasize might. But T-Mobile didn’t promise that, and for a very good reason: rural 5G is prohibitively expensive and almost certainly won’t be offered anytime soon in a suitable density.The other issue is one of labeling. While 5G was designed primarily with the new, high-band spectrum in mind, it doesn’t actually mean high-band. 5G is just a series of new radio protocols to transmit data more efficiently in each slice of spectrum per second. You can put those new radio protocols onto any slice of spectrum and plausibly claim to have fulfilled a promise to deliver “5G” to someone - even if there isn’t enough bandwidth on the tower to do all the things that 5G is capable of doing.Fortunately for T-Mobile, it doesn’t just have the high-bandwidth, low-range 2.5 GHz spectrum to work with. It was also a top winner of the 600 MHz bandwidth auction a few years ago and has already deployed that spectrum in many urban areas. 600 MHz doesn’t offer nearly the bandwidth of 2.5 GHz, but it travels much further from each tower and can cover far more territory.Most likely, then, T-Mobile will put 5G, or at least a precursor of it, on its new 600 MHz bandwidth and pronounce its 5G rural effort complete. And there will be precious little the FCC can or will do about it.This then is the minimum that can be expected from the New T-Mobile. But, in fact, I suspect the upside is higher still. Tomorrow, I will publish another article analyzing the alternative scenario. T-Mobile is actually, in my view, more likely to become a member of a new oligopoly, which would make even these projections conservative. But since there is no consensus on that point, this analysis should serve to reassure that even T-Mobile’s floor is quite a bit above us yet."
4373109,20599,2020-09-08T15:31:47-04:00,"The debt of T-Mobile US has ballooned to $72 billion after the Sprint merger. It now has to incur an annual interest expense of approximately $2.06 billion starting Q2 2020.However, the company has the potential to generate more than adequate operating profits and cash flows to cover easily the interest payment.It is also growing faster than its peers and its prospects look exciting.","By and large, investors have been bullish on the prospects of T-Mobile US (TMUS), and they continue to hold that view even after its merger with the underperforming and sluggish Sprint, in April 2020. Today, the company is America's second-largest wireless carrier. Many analysts have upgraded the stock, and, recently, Scotiabank ranked it as an outperformer.That said, the company's total debt has ballooned to $72 billion after the Sprint merger and the interest expense is estimated to be heavy going forward. A lot depends on how the company leverages Sprint's underperforming assets, its operational strengths, and the low-interest-rate regime to its advantage. This is how its prospects look going forward:TMUS' DebtIn Q2 2020, the company raised $27 billion debt, including $4 billion in senior secured notes, at an average interest rate of just 2.16%. This new debt will be used to retire older high-yield debt in Q3 2020.Image Source: TMUS Q2 Earnings Call TranscriptTMUS's short-term and long-term debt significantly increased from about $27 billion as of Q4 2019 to $72.18 billion as of Q2 2020. The increase was on account of assuming Sprint's long-term debt of $29.03 billion and the fresh issue of $27 billion mentioned above, less debt repayments.Image Source: TMUS's Quarterly SEC FilingTMU's Annual Interest ObligationsImage Source: TMUS's Quarterly SEC FilingThe company estimates it will have to pay $6.18 billion as interest on long-term debt in the next 3 years starting June 30, 2020. This implies that the average interest the company will have to pay on its long-term debt is $2.06 billion annually.TMUS's ProfitabilityIn Q2, 2020, which was an offbeat quarter because of the Sprint merger, TMUS generated a gross profit of $10.95 billion and an operating income of $2.37 billion. Note that I am not comparing Q2 2020 profitability with that of Q1 2020 because of the merger.Image Source: TMUS Q2 2020 Income StatementTMUS's Q2 2020 was eventful and loaded with expenses. Its net income was impacted by merger-related expenses of $798 million, virus-related costs of $341 million, and merger-related impairment charges of $418 million. It also paid $109 million as consent fees related to its long-term debt. These expenses and cash outflows were one-offs and will not appear from Q3 2020 onwards.Based on the Q2 profitability numbers, it's easy to estimate that the company has sufficient firepower to generate robust revenues and profits that can easily cover the interest on the new enlarged debt.Peer ComparisonImage Source: Investing.comTMUS has outperformed its peers, AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) from the momentum, value, and profitability points of view. Since the middle of March 2020, TMUS's price has gained 33.84% while T gained just 11.65% and VZ lost 14.65% in value.TMUS has added a total of 1.2 million customers in Q2 2020, again outperforming its peers, and now it is competing very aggressively with them by introducing attractive 5G plans and offers.Summing up and RatingTMUS has many positives going for it - second largest wireless carrier in the U.S., sector outperformer, aggressive management team, 5G in all states, etc. COVID-19 too has worked in favor of most companies in the communications sector.The company has started the processes of integrating Sprint's spectrum with its own, decommissioning unproductive sites, and rationalizing its retail stores. It should report higher revenues and lower costs in Q3 and Q4 2020. The company's future looks bright.It may be a debt whale, but when it comes to profits, it is an aggressive shark ready for the kill.As the stock has caught the investors' fancy, it is difficult to benchmark its price with its fair value, so I'll pass. It has received so many upgrades, including one from Scotiabank, that any market whale can start chasing it, driving up its price.*Like this article? Don't forget to hit the Follow button above!"
4371867,105703,2020-09-01T03:27:02-04:00,"Since merging with Sprint, T-Mobile has become one of the top two wireless carriers in the U.S., with a strong portfolio of assets.The company continues its strong track record of customer retention and subscriber additions.Going forward, I expect the company's enviable 5G position to be a meaningful catalyst for growth.","T-Mobile (TMUS) has had a decent run over the past 52 weeks, with the shares returning 51% since the same time last year. One of the catalysts for this increase has been its strong execution since its merger with Sprint, which propelled it to become the #2 carrier in the U.S., and reduced the number of top wireless carriers from four to three. In this article, I explore the pros and cons of investing in T-Mobile shares today, and evaluate whether this makes an attractive long-term investment; so let’s get started.(Source: Company website)After much anticipation, T-Mobile finally closed its merger with Sprint back in April of this year. This came after a settlement with the Department of Justice, in which T-Mobile agreed to divest the Sprint prepaid business and certain spectrum assets to DISH Network (Dish) (DISH), and make available to Dish 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations. Since the merger, T-Mobile has quickly become the #2 wireless provider in the U.S. with 98.3 million customers, putting it ahead of AT&T (T).What I like about this merger is that it enables a much faster deployment of multiple high-quality 5G networks for American consumers. Currently, T-Mobile already has America’s largest 5G network, which covers 250 million people over 1.3 million square miles. Management’s intent is to increase its network capacity 14-fold over the next six years, resulting in network speeds that are 15x faster than the current speeds today. This will expand 5G coverage to 99% of Americans, thereby solidifying its reputation as one of the dominant telecommunications providers.In what I see as a net positive for the telecom industry as a whole, this latest industry consolidation puts T-Mobile and its two large competitors in a better negotiating position with cell tower owners, from which they lease sites. As a near-term benefit for the company, T-Mobile will be able to reduce the number of redundant cell sites, thereby resulting in long-term cost synergies for the company.T-Mobile is also known for having innovative offerings, such as T-Mobile Money, which provides checking accounts with competitive interest rates. In addition, unlike AT&T (T), it appears that T-Mobile has opted to go with the partnership (versus acquisition) route when it comes to media offerings. This is supported by the Netflix (NFLX) and Quibi streaming deals that it offers its customers through certain wireless plans.This, combined with a high-quality network, has resulted in T-Mobile expanding its postpaid customer base by 60% over the past five years, while its competitors have posted virtually no growth. I find this track record for customer retention to be key, especially when considering that T-Mobile is inheriting a customer base from Sprint, which is known for having high customer churn rates.The latest results show encouraging news, as management appears to be executing well with the combined company so far. As seen below, the key metrics are pointing in the right direction, as noted on the company’s Q2 press release:In addition, the Sprint integration appears to be going well, as management has made solid progress in migrating customers onto the T-Mobile network, as noted on the latest conference call (emphasis added by author):Lastly, T-Mobile now controls 319 MHz of combined low- and mid-band spectrum nationwide, which is more than AT&T and Verizon (VZ) combined. This is a major advantage for the company as it continues its roll-out of 5G, thereby making T-Mobile a powerhouse to contend with.Turning to analyst estimates, it appears that Wall Street sees further upside for the share price, as the investment community has been impressed by the company’s recent performance. As seen below, the current average price target is $130 per share, which sits comfortably above where the shares are trading at today.(Source: YCharts)While T-Mobile appears to be executing on all fronts, investors should also be mindful of the risks. For one, the 5G space requires constant investment, and technological evolution could require the company to invest more than it originally planned. The company carries a sizeable $67.5 billion in long-term debt, and unplanned investments could further strain its balance sheet. In addition, increased availability of spectrum can reduce barriers to entry into the wireless space, as evidenced by Comcast’s (CMCSA) and other cable carriers’ low-cost wireless offerings. While this risk is small at the moment, it could make the market more competitive down the line.Since merging with Sprint, T-Mobile has become one of the top two wireless carriers in the U.S. The company continued its strong track record of performance in its latest quarter, and the merger integration appears to be going well. Going forward, I expect the company to be in an enviable position with its strong 5G offerings.I see further upside at the current price of $116.88 and a blended P/EBITDA of 6.6. While the shares are not exactly cheap (Verizon has a blended P/EBITDA of 5.2), I find the valuation to be reasonable, with the expectation of strong forward growth. For reference, EBITDA is a commonly reported measure of profitability in the telecommunications industry, due to the capital-intensive nature of the business.(Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs)"
4351057,104674,2020-05-30T11:24:46-04:00,"Deutsche Telekom AG is relatively coronavirus proof.The company might even have an opportunity to take advantage of the situation as it could increase its stake in T-Mobile US, Inc. at favorable conditions.T-Mobile US is a profitable growth machine and has a chance of becoming the market leader in the US following the Sprint merger.SoftBank Group Corp. is under pressure and seeks to monetize up to $20 billion of its T-Mobile US position, but can only do so with Deutsche Telekom's consent.While Deutsche Telekom already carries a considerable debt load, I believe that it has the financial means to make a transaction work without taking too great a risk.","Deutsche Telekom AG (OTCQX:DTEGF) (OTCQX:DTEGY) is relatively resilient against the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Indirectly, it might even profit from the situation as it could get the opportunity to increase its stake in T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) at favorable conditions. Despite its existing debt load, I believe that Deutsche Telekom has the financial means to comfortably do so without taking too much risk. Below, I will explain this thesis in more detail.Deutsche Telekom's core business is largely coronavirus proof. At least that is what the Q1 results indicate. Only the roaming revenue was massively affected by the pandemic. That however was offset by a coronavirus-related 33 percent increase in fixed call revenues. The company reported growth of both revenue (+2.3 percent) and profitability (EBITDA after leases +3.8 percent ex US; +10.2 percent incl. US). Net profit grew 1.8 percent (adjusted: +8.5 percent) to €916 million (adjusted: €1.28 billion). The full-year guidance was confirmed.All in all, the potential for a negative coronavirus impact on Deutsche Telekom's business is fairly limited. Only low margin businesses such as the sale of smartphones (due to closed brick and mortar shops) and the aforementioned roaming revenue (due to non existing travel) are really endangered by the pandemic. On the other hand, some aspects of the virus (or more precisely the counter measures such as ""social distancing"") may lead to an increased demand for the company's core services.Another opportunity for Deutsche Telekom to take advantage of the coronavirus situation - albeit indirectly - could arise in the shape of an opportunity to increase its stake in T-Mobile US at favorable conditions. Deutsche Telekom already is the controlling shareholder with a 43.6 percent ownership interest and 68 percent of voting rights. T-Mobile's second largest shareholder, SoftBank Group Corp. (OTCPK:SFTBF) (OTCPK:SFTBY) which owns 24.7 percent, is under severe financial pressure and seeks to monetize some of its assets. That includes a $20 billion portion of its T-Mobile US stake. However, SoftBank may not sell any of its shares without Deutsche Telekom's consent due to a contractual four-year lock-up. Naturally, that puts Deutsche Telekom in an advantageous position. With SoftBank being under pressure to proceed as fast as possible, the company might be able to buy a portion of the package itself. It could very well do so at some discount.Deutsche Telekom would thus increase its ownership of a company that has the chance to become the market leader in the US mobile market. It currently has close to 30 percent market share, which means that the market leaders Verizon Wireless - a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, Inc. (NYSE:VZ) - and AT&T (NYSE:T) are in sight. The latter have 35 and 34 percent market share respectively, but T-Mobile US leads in terms of subscriber growth. In the long run, Deutsche Telekom would not only be able to get through the coronavirus crisis relatively unaffected, but also indirectly profit from its impact.Boosting the stake in T-Mobile US to over 50 percent would probably cost at least somewhere near $7 billion, give or take. Of course that number would be greater the more shares would be bought. At the same time, the company reported net debt of €77 billion as of March 31st. That is about three times 2019 EBITDA after leases or nearly 11 times the 2019 free cash flow. And the debt load has definitely become larger by now due to the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile US which became effective April 1st. And after all, considerable investments are still necessary, for example the 5G implementation.Nonetheless, I believe that Deutsche Telekom has the financial reserves to afford it. As of March 31st, the company had cash and equivalents of more than €4 billion on its books. More importantly, Deutsche Telekom's business is very stable. One might even call it utterly boring (albeit in the most positive sense of the word). A low risk business such as telecommunications can arguably be undertaken with a higher debt load than other businesses, while maintaining the same risk profile. In the unlikely case of emergencies, Deutsche Telekom could also cut or cancel the annual dividend in order to make cash available. While the risk arising from some additional debt would be manageable, T-Mobile US is a growth machine. And a profitable one indeed. Q1 revenue grew 5 percent YoY to $8.7 billion, while adjusted EBITDA grew 12 percent to $3.7 billion. Free cash flow even grew 18 percent to $732 million. The addition of the Sprint business will probably slow down the relative growth a little. However, it will further increase the absolute growth figure. The expected synergies will give another significant boost to profitability in the long run. In the short term there may be some issues with a rise in bad debt due to the Keep Americans Connected Pledge ($75 to $125 million as of Q1), a figure that could increase depending on the severeness of the pandemic's impact on US households. But medium to long term an additional investment in T-Mobile US should be worth it, especially if Deutsche Telekom can get it at a discount. Also, interest rates will probably remain at very low levels for a long time, if not forever. Under these circumstances, it would arguably make even more sense to make use of this opportunity.Increasing its ownership of T-Mobile US at favorable conditions could be a unique opportunity for Deutsche Telekom. Despite its considerable indebtedness, the company has the financial means to do so, given its stable and profitable business. In fact, in the long run, it might even help paying off the debt faster. The coronavirus crisis does not negatively change the situation materially. On the contrary, indirectly, it even created the opportunity.Of course, once a potential transaction would be completed, a phase of consolidation and debt reduction would be appropriate. Yet, I am confident that Deutsche Telekom would be able to do so faster and more effectively if it had a higher stake in T-Mobile US. In fact, the future profits from the US wireless business could very well be able to finance the lion's share of the debt going forward. A larger ownership interest in the profitable growth machine that is T-Mobile US would also enable the company to grow its dividend in the long run (though arguably that should not be the top priority in the next three to four years)."
4325444,42661,2020-02-19T19:33:44-05:00,Court Approval of TMUS/S merger sets up final endgame.This analysis examines the factors likely to drive the final closure of the deal and its valuations.Investors can generate >25.8% annualized yield rate while reducing market risk to 6.8% below the minimum valuation seen for the deal closure and 16% downside protection from current market.,"Trading the long-delayed T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS)/Sprint (NYSE:S) merger has been very profitable for the past 18+ months. Now, with all regulatory approvals and court approval, excellent opportunities for high yield returns at low risk still exist for savvy investors.The T-Mobile US/Sprint merger agreement was inked in April 2018. Since that time, regulatory approval delays and, ultimately, a lawsuit by 7 States to block the deal have delayed the closing of this deal. The court verdict in favor of the merger was issued February 11, 2020.On 10/16/19, I first presented Seeking Alpha readers ideas to use cash secured puts to generate high yield with lowered market risk on this special situation. Since that time, I have provided frequent updated trades to roll forward with continuing delays and continue generating repeated high-yield trades, pocketing superior premium cash income each time.Only one step remains to close this deal. The original agreement (with extensions) has formally expired during the court trial. Both parties announced at that time their continuing commitment to the agreement through the court verdict. Now that this has been obtained, there is talk that T-Mobile controlling holder Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) wants to revise the deal because TMUS stock has advanced at a better pace than S shares, and the concessions made to regulatory bodies have decreased assets that S brings to the deal. Sprint's largest holder, SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBF), indicates it sees no reason to renegotiate the deal.This final brinkmanship by the principle players is likely to be brief, and the outcome is highly predictable within a narrow range:1. Both parties have invested almost 2 years in hammering out this final deal, working closely with regulatory agencies to negotiate concessions divesting some of their assets and working jointly to plan the critical early rollout phases of national 5G coverage for the United States.2. Both parties need this deal (Sprint to survive, and T-Mobile to leap from 3rd to 1st in the competitive market, while securing needed spectrum and tower networks to rapidly transition to 5G).3. The original deal provided 0.10256 shares of TMUS for each S share. At the TMUS market price at the time of the original inking, S shares were valued at about $8.25. Currently, with TMUS trading at $99.88, this ratio values S shares at $10.25.4. TMUS shares immediately rose $9.17 at market open following announcement of the court approval ruling.There have been many articles and comments this past week over the wisdom and benefits of the deal at this time. Those discussions cover a broad set of topics ranging from the value of assets to the relative negotiating position strength of the 2 parties. Although interesting, none of that is really relevant at this point. Clearly, the original $8.25/share valuation for Sprint was acceptable to both sides. It is an absolute minimum Sprint holders will probably consider acceptable without considering inviting bids for all or parts of its assets from other interested parties. In addition, the up-gap of $9.17 on court approval would almost surely be given up if TMUS walked from the deal at this time. Since the current valuation, an instant $9.17 to fight over $2.00. Nobody is that stupid. Thus, $8.25 to ~$10.15 represents the likely final deal valuation if any renegotiation at all is undertaken to close. Given the minimum market risk of $9.17 to TMUS if the deal evaporates, the valuation is likely to be towards the higher side of that $2.00 range rather than the lower.Given this analysis, a conservative idea to consider is to write cash secured puts using the current pricing for at 2/18/20 market close on 57-day contracts for 4/17/20 $8.00 @ $0.31 premium, with required net covering cash of $7.69. This provides a 25.81% annualized yield rate, while the $7.69 net entry cost risk is well below the minimum estimated deal valuation, and market risk is limited to 58 days.If you liked this analysis and are interested in how to generate double-digit income yields while reducing (but never fully eliminating) market risk, then consider becoming a follower, so you get notices of my articles are published.Thanks for taking the time to read my work. Please share your comments and join further discussion of this thesis in the comment section. I consider that section an integral part of the article, providing important added discussion from both readers and myself."
4347118,105526,2020-05-13T12:00:45-04:00,"T-Mobile posts a strong first quarter, supported by impressive subscriber growth numbers.The Q2 guidance was also encouraging and revealed a brighter medium-term outlook for ""new"" T-Mobile.Synergy upside will be key to the growth story, with a convergence of the EBITDA margin gap to AT&T and Verizon potentially adding to the upside.T-Mobile is available at a discount through DT shares.","The closing of the Sprint merger in April marks a watershed moment for the North American telecom industry, as T-Mobile (TMUS) looks to have gain ground on AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ). T-Mobile's postpaid market share stands out, reaching approximately 30%, supporting the company's updated target of 2-4% service revenue growth. T-Mobile (through Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGF)) is my top pick in telecom; the ""new"" T-Mobile offers investors a resilient growth story in telecom, even through a recession, as the realization of synergies and operating efficiencies look set to drive EBITDA growth going forward. The implied discount through DT has widened following the Sprint deal and, thus, presents an attractive opportunity to buy into the TMUS story at a discount.T-Mobile's first quarter was a positive start to the ""new"" T-Mobile story, with service revenue growth and postpaid net additions the key highlights from the quarter. Although revenue was slightly below consensus at $11.1 billion (+0.3% YoY), adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion (+11.6% YoY) was considerably above par, driving free cash flow of $732 million (+18.4% YoY).Source: Earnings ReleaseOf particular note was branded net customer additions, which reached 649,000 for the quarter, as 777,000 branded gross postpaid net customer additions were offset by a loss of 128,000 branded prepaid net customer additions. The loss of prepaid subs will need to be monitored going forward, but I think the latest dip reflects a delay in tax refunds, which have typically driven net adds for the prepaid segment. This should not affect the medium to longer-term view, however, and thus, I would peg this down to a timing issue, with a prepaid rebound likely in Q2 or Q3. The record-low branded postpaid churn of 0.86% and prepaid churn of 3.52%, should also provide investors plenty of comfort as we head into challenging Q2.Source: Earnings ReleaseT-Mobile's Q1 results this time around paled in comparison to the guidance, however, as the forward-looking guidance finally encompasses Sprint and a full quarter of the coronavirus impact. Looking ahead, T-Mobile expects postpaid voice net adds to remain positive (0-150k) despite softer results at Sprint, the sale of Boost during Q2, and a lower switching environment. The rise in postpaid net adds accounts for the impact of continued store closures, with lower gross additions for the quarter offset by lower churn.Revenue and EBITDA should remain mostly unchanged, with adjusted EBITDA guided to be $6.2-6.5 billion, including leasing revenues of $1.3-1.4 billion. This would imply a resilient underlying ""cash"" EBITDA of $4.9-5.1 billion. However, the EBITDA figure does also excludes merger-related costs ($500-600 million) and COVID-19-related costs ($450-550 million) and bad debt associated with the FCC's Keep Americans Connected pledge ($75-125 million). The bad debt number is worth monitoring as there is a risk it could tick up further should the economic fallout from COVID-19 worsen. For now, management sees the impact on margins and sub growth as manageable with increased demand for lower-priced service providing a timely offset.Capex is also guided to ramp to $2.3-2.4 billion as the focus shifts to network integration, including the 2.5 GHz and 600 MHz rollouts for 5G coverage. Some of the capex will be utilized to maintain network quality for Sprint as the company looks to control churn within the Sprint subscriber base. As a result, free cash flow (inclusive of merger and COVID-19 related costs) is guided to be in the $1.3-1.5 billion range for Q2.Source: Earnings ReleaseOf particular importance, I think, was management's confidence in its ability to ""unlock even more synergies than originally planned,"" with additional upside from scale efficiencies relative to the initial target ($6 billion run-rate synergies within the next 3-4 years). Several key areas will influence the extent of synergy upside, for instance, the acceleration of T-Mobile's retail rationalization, the pace of network integration, procurement efficiencies, and improvements in the Sprint subscriber base churn.At present, the expectation remains for $500-$600 million of merger-related costs in Q2, though this amount is before any incremental opportunities to accelerate synergy realization through a potential pull-forward of additional spending (severance-related restructuring, store rationalization, and network build expenses) into Q2. For context on the importance of synergy realization to the T-Mobile story, applying the $6 billion merger synergies target to EBITDA would add approximately 9-10%pts to pro forma EBITDA margins by 2024.Source: ""New"" T-Mobile SlidesHowever, the current synergy target could prove conservative if T-Mobile can get its margins to match AT&T's and VZ's, which are 8.9%pts and 20.3%pts higher, respectively. T-Mobile could also drive incremental expansion to its subscriber base if it can lower Sprint churn to pre-Sprint levels. A comparison of T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon's EBITDA margins are as follows:Source: Company DataThe key opportunity for investors lies in the divergence between TMUS shares and the decline in Deutsche Telekom shares since the merger announcement, with recent price trends resulting in the TMUS stake being offered at a steep discount.Data by YChartsAs the underlying non-US EBITDA stands at €14 billion, with €35 billion of net debt, applying a 6x EV/EBITDA multiple (in-line with the EU telco sector), would imply €29 billion of equity value for the EU business. Deducting this from the current DT market cap of c. €65 billion would leave c. €36 billion of implied equity value assigned to the 43% TMUS stake (implied c. 25% discount).A greater-than-expected synergy rationalization would add an incremental tailwind to DT's valuation, while any EBITDA-level disappointments could raise investor concerns around the gearing. Nonetheless, my base case also calls for a smooth deleveraging, as TMUS is cash-generative and should benefit from synergy realization, though leverage levels will certainly be worth monitoring going forward.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The market no longer underestimates the odds of a merger injunction.In fact, it may well be overestimating it now. I came away from the trial far less impressed with the states' chances than Cowen.It seems to me to be better than even odds that the companies prevail, though I agree the states have a stronger legal argument by far.","One way or another, we appear to be reaching the finish line on the long-running saga of the Sprint (S) merger with T-Mobile (TMUS) that SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY) had such high hopes for. As such, I am closing a longstanding trade to profit off of the merger speculation and recommending against any further Sprint positions in the near term, although I expect to take a new position again in due course.For some time now, I have been regularly updating an options trade on Sprint stock which has been highly profitable. Since the merger was announced, put and call options have proven a far more effective way of betting on the outcome of the merger than just straight-up stock purchases or shorts.After the best chunk of profits yet on this trade, which I have shown the opportunity to take profits on and reinvested several times now, I am finally recommending closing the trade down and cashing out. The last and final round of the trade will have generated roughly 120% profits - more than doubling - in just fourteen weeks.In a nutshell, it's time to cash out because the market no longer underestimates the potential for a merger injunction to be granted. Indeed, it may now be overestimating it. Cowen, recently, put the odds of the states winning the case at 60%. In my view, Cowen has its ratios reversed. I'd put the companies' odds at about 60%.As such, there is no reason to hold the put options I recommended any longer - better opportunities can be found elsewhere.This is not to say that I think the merger should go through. In fact, to be honest, I've had increasing difficulty being calm and dispassionate as this process has gone on. The trial that began last month definitely found evidence enough to establish the merger's anti-competitive impact.For one thing, documentary evidence of Sprint executives suggesting that the merger was good for a $5 boost to ARPU across the wireless industry as competitive pressure eased. Emails from Deutsche Telekom's (OTCQX:DTEGF) employees have been unearthed making similar comments. And then, there's all the analysis the states' economic experts did.What's more, this is the first merger I can recall where the deal's proponents aren't even really bothering to deny the companies will raise prices. As DOJ has recently made clear, it sees the primary benefits of the merger as T-Mobile's promise to increase service density in the rural areas where 18% of Americans live and accelerate higher-priced 5G deployment, which the administration favors for national security reasons.In exchange for which, it is essentially guaranteeing them the chance to extract higher oligopolistic prices and profits from the 82% of us who do not live in rural areas. So, the merger will raise prices on consumers, and I would have thought, in an antitrust trial, that would simply end the case.Most ugly, if perhaps not most economically relevant, was DISH CEO Charlie Ergen's revelation that the DOJ antitrust chief affirmatively urged him to lobby senators on the deal's behalf - a direct foray into politics from what is traditionally seen as among the most politically neutral posts in a traditionally politically neutral Cabinet department. It's really not that unusual for senior figures to direct lobbying efforts by private parties... but, it is a little unusual to get caught doing it, and it didn't look good.Actually, though, experts seem to be cutting their own estimates for an unrelated reason: the number of states involved in the lawsuit.From the moment the states announced their lawsuits, T-Mobile has been trying to pick them off and winnow down the number on the suit. Colorado became the second state to withdraw after DISH agreed to park a new wireless headquarters in the state, following Mississippi which also dropped out.Texas's defection from the lawsuit was probably the most damaging - it removed the last Republican AG from the suit and allowed the deal's proponents to paint the effort as an entirely partisan affair. (Florida, the other large GOP state, was never a party and became one of the largest states to concur in the DOJ proposed settlement.)Nevada was the next dropout, and for a while, it looked like the whole thing might fall apart, but as it turned out, the New York AG that flatly ruled out any deal with the state - that would have almost certainly ended the need for a trial entirely if reached - managed to hold the other 14 states and DC onside.This was what led Ric Prentiss of Raymond James to cut his estimate of merger approval odds from 85% to 55%, which is close to where most experts aside from Cowen have it at this point. It's close to where I have it too. He specifically cited the absence of a ""Third Settlement"" deal with a large number of states - the first two were with the FCC and the DOJ - as the reason of his souring optimism.None of this convinces me, though. Actually, I've been getting increasingly pessimistic about the states' chances as the trial went on.As for the number of states, that really doesn't matter, frankly. As a legal proceeding, the court is concerned with the strength of the arguments being made, not how many are on each side making them. Whatever moral force extra states on the suit may have, it pales in comparison to the legal force of their arguments, and the governments/companies' rebuttal.And there seem to be issues for the states there. At its heart, the case remains an argument that the merger would raise prices on consumers. But Judge Marrero openly said in court that he couldn't imagine T-Mobile would ""be so bold"" as to raise prices following a merger. Any price increases, he insisted, would only result from service improvements.To be honest, this is the kind of thing that has really frustrated me. This is a trial about antitrust concerns with two for-profit companies. If the judge in charge of the trial ""can't imagine"" that the companies would be so ""bold"" as to try to make more money by raising prices, the whole exercise seems rather pointless.What's more, New T-Mobile wouldn't necessarily have to raise headline prices - it could simply offer fewer discounts off those headline prices, which have proliferated since the industry became far more competitive following the blocking of the last T-Mobile merger.What's even more, however, is the underlying assumption of the judge that consumers should pay more when service improves. This ignores the reality that, especially in the technology spaces such as telecom, computing, media, etc., the clear trend has been for both price improvements and service improvements. Witness the rise of cheap video streaming services, online e-commerce with one-day delivery at lower prices than conventional retail, etc.To be sure, the state AGs expert witness, Carl Shapiro, did try to explain these - rather basic - economic concepts to the judge, but it's unclear if Marrero ""gets it,"" for lack of a better term. And if he doesn't get it, the economic realities don't matter much. At the end of the day, this merger only has to make sense to one person. And Marrero seems to be starting from the idea that if T-Mobile is going to build a 5G network, it is somehow entitled to charge more and extract more profits from customers. Everything in the trial, he seems to be viewing through that prism.If T-Mobile convinced him that they will ""earn"" price hikes with a 5G network - regardless of whether customers would prefer 5G to lower prices or regardless of whether T-Mobile would build it anyway even if Sprint stayed independent - and maybe even charge less for it - then T-Mobile definitely has the edge here.What's more, Legere's threat to raise T-Mobile's own prices if the deal is blocked, while not exactly subtle, may well prove to be effective in rebutting the price hike arguments and the email evidence behind them. Legere saying he will simply raise prices anyway, and the market will let him, doesn't make it so, of course. But it offers plausible deniability for a judge to argue that he isn't really allowing consumers to be gouged by a new triopoly.Then, there's also the fact that Marrero has been in a bit of a rush from the beginning. He asked everyone to waive their opening arguments, trim their witness lists, and just, generally, move the process along as fast as possible. Because the companies are currently independent of each other, it seems odd he would be in a rush to… make no changes to the situation. While it's hardly proof of anything by itself, rushing makes the most sense if what he intends is to approve the merger.As such, I am recommending liquidating the $5 put options with May expiration that I recommended buying three months ago. Those options, which I recommended buying at $65 per contract, were most recently trading at $143 per contract - a gain of 120% in just 14 weeks. That price implies a Sprint stock price of $3.57. With Sprint unlikely to fall much below low $3s and a still decent chance Sprint shoots up to $8 with merger approval and makes the options worthless, the risk-reward balance no longer favors holding the options any longer.At some point in the future, I will probably make a new Sprint trade - if, against the odds, it remains an independent company - but, for now, I'm going to watch from the sidelines."
4309004,22148,2019-11-25T12:11:19-05:00,"CEO John Legere officially announced plans to retire May 1, 2020.Top executives don't randomly leave a company when a big opportunity exists.The regulatory delays are pushing the T-Mobile/Sprint 5G network buildout behind AT&T and Verizon.Avoid the stock still trading near the peak after 7 years of strong outperformance.","The official loss of a dynamic CEO by T-Mobile (TMUS) has been mostly ignored by the market this week. With the pending merger of Sprint (S), the move appears to suggest John Legere doesn't see the ability to generate the outsized gains of the past decade. The departure of several executives while the Sprint deal still faces regulatory hurdles makes the stock one to avoid.Image Source: John Legere Twitter John Legere became the CEO of T-Mobile back during September 2012 when the wireless service provider was an afterthought in a duopoly between AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ). About seven years later, he announced his departure effective May 1, 2020 with current COO Mike Sievert taking over.CNBC has long reported that Sievert was expected to take the CEO reigns once the Sprint merger is complete. John Legere is only 61 and seems very energetic so one has to see the timing of his departure as a negative signal.Similar to how the departure of CFO Sarah Friar and de-facto CEO at Square (SQ) in October 2018 top ticked the peak growth for the company and the high in the stock.Investors only have to view the price change in the major wireless stocks since September 2012 to see the impact John Legere has had on the sector. Since his marketing genius took over, virtually all of the growth and stock gains in the sector have ended up at T-Mobile.Data by YChartsAnother worrying part of the story is the simultaneous departure of the CFO. Similar to Legere, Braxton Carter is only 60 years old. World class executives just don't leave when staring at a massive opportunity.The timing of these departures may suggest both the CEO and CFO see the Sprint merger as necessary to compete with AT&T and Verizon in 5G, but the integration of Sprint and the eventual buildout of a combined network places the wireless industry players with no advantage in the game. As of now, the Sprint deal isn't approved and several state AGs are suing to block the merger.The marketing success of John Legere might be most visible in the annual capital spending of the major players in the industry. T-Mobile has the smallest budget in the sector, yet the largest wireless services revenue growth. According to Bloomberg, the company went from a subscriber laggard to surpassing Sprint and closing a big gap with AT&T.This year, T-Mobile expects to spend $6.1 billion on capex and the combination with Sprint is needed to match Verizon and even become comparable to the $21 billion spent annually by AT&T.Source: S&P GlobalThe issue is that the current 4G networks have no discernible difference while the coverage of the new 5G networks is a different story. The delay of the merger and ability to fully integrate 5G network plans is placing T-Mobile further behind the industry leaders. The issue reminds me of how AT&T entered the Time Warner merger with a leadership position in the SVOD market via HBO and exited the merger already behind Disney (DIS), Apple (AAPL) and others.The company forecasts needing the merger in order to ramp up capital spending in order to build the best 5G network. One can even argue the stock is cheap in comparison to AT&T and Verizon at only 5.8x forward EV/EBITDA estimates.Data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that big executives don't leave without plans of actually retiring when big opportunities exist. Investors need to pay attention to the signal of John Legere leaving T-Mobile even before the regulators have signed off on the Sprint merger. His marketing prowess will be missed by the wireless company. His departure and the delays in the merger and hence the delays in the merger integration and buildout of the combined 5G network makes the stock one to avoid here while still trading close to all-time highs."
4304068,95916,2019-11-07T19:50:04-05:00,"T-Mobile remains strong in wireless service, but its nascent campaign to revolutionize TV in the same way does not appear to be off to a roaring start.However, T-Mobile's pending new deal with Quibi could change this.Expanding on its video subscription offerings, currently limited only to Netflix itself, could both enhance T-Mobile's appeal to customers and potentially help to contain content costs on streaming services.","Understandably, T-Mobile US (TMUS) market watchers continue to focus overwhelmingly on its pending merger with Sprint (S) and the new strategic partner it will make out of SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY) and Masa Son.While T-Mobile has talked a lot about revolutionizing mobile Internet with its new spectrum haul, it shouldn’t be forgotten that it is also trying to revolutionize television - albeit at a more deliberate, dare I say even sluggish pace.There’s recently been some new news on this front, while the merger outcome won’t be known until after the trial verdict which is set for next year - and if the losing side appeals, won’t be known even then. This article will therefore analyze the new developments in TV at T-Mobile and what they portend for its ability to revolutionize another major industry in the US.Admittedly, the new development is not exactly television as a traditionalist would define that term: upcoming, soon-to-launch new streaming service Quibi has inked a deal with T-Mobile US to make the carrier its exclusive wireless partner. But that has more significance for T-Mobile and television than might appear.Quibi is a new mobile-only service - very similar to Snap Inc. (SNAP) - that offers only short-form content. But in a departure from Snapchat’s user-generated features, Quibi will confine itself to professionally-created, curated content. At over $1 billion a year, Quibi has a large enough content budget to be a significant player in the streaming space, and among Quibi contributors will be the king of live sports, ESPN, which has inked a deal to provide a daily highlights show.T-Mobile’s foray into TV proper, propelled by its merger with Layer3, has not quite landed with the same punch as its many wireless initiatives did. After months of waiting for a proper launch of the product, the reviews for TVision Home are starting to come in. The verdict? T-Mobile has indeed worked a revolution: it is far more transparent than any other provider about just how sky-high prices for TV have become. But aside from being honest about them, it doesn’t really do much to bring them down.T-Mobile does offer a $10 discount off of TV service to existing wireless subscribers - or at least it will when the $90 introductory rate goes away for all TVision subscribers and only wireless customers of T-Mobile are allowed to keep it. But this small bundling discount - a strategy which has already been tried by AT&T (T) and found wanting - is more or less where the innovation stops.You buy a core tier of channels, which you can upgrade if you want with various higher tier options and premium service add-ons. You get a standard DVR and you pay extra for each extra box you want to hook up to another TV in your house. You do get a monthly bill with no long-term contract, which is nice, and the DVR is a little bigger than some competitors. But there is nothing particularly revolutionizing about TVision as such. Not in how it works, nor in the business model behind it.I find T-Mobile’s deal with Quibi especially significant in light of this, because it offers a potential chance for T-Mobile to start over on its nascent “Un-cable” movement. T-Mobile already has a deal with Netflix (NFLX) to be its exclusive wireless partner, and providing free Netflix has become a major part of its pitch to consumers. Quibi offers a chance to both expand on that offering that consumers seem to find valuable and do it better the second time around.For some T-Mobile subscribers, Netflix is no longer free. A series of escalating price hikes - Netflix is 30% more expensive than it was when T-Mobile signed the deal, just two years ago - finally pushed T-Mobile into demanding that most of its customers pay some sort of top-up fee to access it. Magenta Plus, T-Mobile’s most high-priced plan, customers are still exempt, but almost everyone else now pays a $4 top-up fee for Netflix Standard, or they can settle for Netflix Basic. T-Mobile almost certainly wasn’t planning on doing this when it launched Netflix On Us - it simply didn’t anticipate the size of the price hikes Netflix would impose.With Quibi planning to charge $8 per month for its ad-free service and a discounted price for its ad-supported one - much like Hulu does - T-Mobile has two potential routes here.First, it could simply do what it already does with Netflix: offer the basic level of service complimentary and then let anyone who wants to upgrade to the higher tier. That would take T-Mobile’s spending on streaming services up again significantly, though, right after it just imposed a not entirely popular surcharge on Netflix subscribers to bring them down again.The second option is to create a menu. With ad-free Quibi at almost the same-price as Netflix, T-Mobile could hold its costs steady by just sliding Quibi right next to Netflix and giving customers the choice of which one they wanted to subscribe to.One of the attractions of this second path for T-Mobile is that it creates a built-in disincentive for future price hikes for those who choose to partner with it to offer streaming service to T-Mobile customers. “Raising your prices again? Okay, we will pass that price hike through to the customer, increasing their surcharge. Just remember though, we offer multiple services, and they might decide to just cancel you guys and go with the other provider.”By setting a specific dollar amount of compensation for customers and then telling them to go shopping in T-Mobile’s curated streaming service market - almost a voucher-like system - T-Mobile can empower customers to reject future price increases. By offering Netflix On Us, T-Mobile essentially put itself on the hook for whatever price hikes Netflix decided to impose. When they eventually decided they couldn’t do it anymore and started imposing surcharges on customers who were told they would get free Netflix if they switched to T-Mobile, it didn’t go over especially well.The Quibi deal could offer a chance to change that, while also giving T-Mobile a potentially very significant new partner, if Quibi’s bet on short-form content over long-form content turns out to be a good one.And of course, this system works even better if T-Mobile doesn’t stop at two services. Similar deals could well be cut with a variety of other providers. Unfortunately, Disney+ (DIS) and Hulu are already spoken for with Verizon (VZ) and Sprint, respectively, and AT&T will never share HBO Max. But a wide range of other services exist that customers could potentially be interested in.Quibi won’t officially launch until April, so it may be a while before we fully understand how this is going to work and exactly what T-Mobile’s strategy is. But certainly the potential exists for it to create a very different approach to changing TV that is actually revolutionary, instead of just replicating the traditional offering with a slight bundle discount.T-Mobile has done such a good job shaking up the wireless industry that there is not a whole lot left to do there, and the pending merger if approved will probably further reduce scope for future shake-up as pricing pressures ease and taking profits from consumers under the current arrangements becomes easier. TV is another path to continuing to expand T-Mobile’s customer base and revenue growth, but it needs a stronger effort than what TVision Home has thus far shown.It’s possible the new Quibi deal will give T-Mobile investors that extra push into a different way of shaking up TV: instead of a bundle discount and a slightly bigger DVR, T-Mobile gives you free money with your wireless bill and tells you to go shopping for whatever services you like, a la carte."
4313923,95916,2019-12-23T16:18:14-05:00,"T-Mobile has substantially underperformed the market since I withdrew my long recommendation on it seven months ago.I remain of the view that T-Mobile's content strategy, vis a vis content partners such as Netflix and Quibi, remains an important operational consideration for investors.T-Mobile's Netflix downgrade probably did cost it some customers, but clever use of the savings to invest in other promotions seems to have largely counteracted this effect.Having avoided the underperformance of the past several months, I am now cautiously re-entering T-Mobile.","About seven months ago, I published an article ending my long recommendation on T-Mobile (TMUS) because of an upcoming potential rupture in its relationship with Netflix (NFLX) - a relationship which had become a major piece of T-Mobile’s marketing strategy over the past few years. It was not well received, to put it mildly.Enough time has now passed that the results of my recommendation, and T-Mobile’s shift in approach, can now be fairly measured. I recognize that many readers have already indicated they see little value in watching things like T-Mobile’s promotional video efforts, but for those who do, I want to update the relevant metrics and my thesis.The purpose of this article therefore is to update my T-Mobile analysis - again - but also to highlight what we can learn from the results of the past seven months.Let’s just get one thing out of the way first: one indicator that maybe my argument wasn’t completely off my rocker is that it worked.When I began researching that article almost seven months ago, T-Mobile had just closed for the weekend trading at $75.23. By the time I was actually done writing, it was trading “above $74” and Seeking Alpha has the trading price when they approved it for publication as $73.60. At the time of this writing, it is trading at $75.20, though it may have moved by the time you read this. A gain of somewhere between flat and roughly 2%, while the S&P has risen over 11% over the same time frame. So certainly as it turns out investors would not have been harmed by following my advice, and indeed would even have been helped by it.Of course, even a blind squirrel occasionally finds a nut; broken clocks are right twice a day, and all that. The mere fact that the stock moved favorably relative to my investment strategy does not mean that I was correct in my reasoning. But it certainly doesn’t mean it was wrong, either.At the time, I specifically noted that my analysis was unrelated to the pending merger with Sprint (S) and was short-term only. As I put it at the time:I also noted that I would consider buying back into T-Mobile at a later date. My concern was not so much with the pending rescission or degradation of T-Mobile’s Netflix subsidy for consumers, but rather with the potential for damage to its brand if it were poorly handled.These qualifications did not stop an overwhelmingly negative reaction to my article. Among the many criticisms fit for public repetition is that a $2 hike on a $140 product was negligible, that no one knew what T-Mobile actually paid for Netflix subscriptions, that T-Mobile would just switch to another streaming provider, and that I don’t have the best track record with T-Mobile recommendations. (I’ve made two long recommendations and made money both times, but I also recommended cashing out for a period in the interim, where I missed out on substantial further gains.)The question now is, has evidence emerged to justify my concern with the downgrade, and what implications do T-Mobile’s decisions have for its future performance?The time is right for an update, because we now have the results of T-Mobile’s strategy review by management in relation to Netflix: changes have indeed been made.T-Mobile has quietly retired its ONE unlimited plans and replaced them with new unlimited plans called Magenta for new customers. Existing customers can also upgrade to them, though as always, T-Mobile will not force customers to leave their current plans. The new Magenta plans are basically the old ONE plans, with two significant differences:T-Mobile downgraded free Netflix from Standard to Basic, meaning someone on a new Magenta plan who wants the old Netflix Standard must now pay a $4 upgrade fee. Existing ONE customers will have the $2 increase from Netflix’s most recent price hike passed on to them but won’t have to pony up the full $4 for Standard. As was always the case, upgrading again from Standard to Premium will cost the difference, an additional $3.If they are willing to downgrade to Netflix Basic, customers might as well transition to Magenta, because T-Mobile will not only provide that free but is also throwing in 3 GB of high-speed hotspot data on the new plans, something the old ones did not have. Meanwhile, the higher-tier Magenta plan will keep the same 20 GB hotspot as always, and also cover the latest price hike on Netflix, keeping Netflix Standard free. Those plans cost $10 extra per line, just like their ONE predecessors.Perhaps anticipating at least a little churn from the changes, T-Mobile also went hunting for some more customers to steal from its rivals by offering to match any corporate or affiliate discounts that they are receiving from their current carrier if they port over.Despite skepticism that this was anything worth getting worked up over, there does appear to have been an impact, and customers do seem to have noticed they’re getting less Netflix “On Us” than before. For one thing, I visited several T-Mobile stores over the summer where Netflix surcharges had become one of the leading subjects of customer complaints whenever I walked in. But that’s purely anecdotal, of course.More importantly, the decision received considerable media attention, and its changes were largely framed as “pay more or downgrade” ultimatums to consumers. I wasn’t the only one to suggest that consumers might have some sort of backlash to this.But this only matters if customers actually did something about it. So how did T-Mobile’s bottom line react to the changes?T-Mobile’s third-quarter earnings gave mixed signals about whether it actually suffered ill effects from this realignment. On the one hand, revenue growth declined to 2% Y/Y, which was its lowest number in at least five years. On the other hand, churn hit record lows and subscriber postpaid phone net adds declined only very modestly, from 774,000 to 754,000.Altogether, I read this data as indicating that T-Mobile did take a hit from throttling back on Netflix subsidies, but was very smart about how it reinvested the resulting savings to spur subscriber growth through other avenues to make up for it, for the most part. T-Mobile’s hotspot offer improvement alone was probably worth something, and then it also launched matching offers for discounts on other carriers to reduce obstacles to switching.When a company switches funds from providing a benefit to matching a discount, one would expect it to show up in lower revenues (higher discounts) without reducing profits, since costs are also falling as benefits are throttled back. The lack of significant loss in net adds means that T-Mobile probably did see damage from reducing Netflix support - but managed to repair almost all of it. Customers who were more attracted to Netflix might have declined to join the Un-Carrier, but they were almost all replaced by those more attracted to a simple credit on their bill.Overall, T-Mobile has indeed navigated the Netflix hike waters without too much difficulty, as its defenders always said it would. I am not quite as sanguine on the idea that downgrading Netflix will mean “nothing” to new subscribers, nor do I think hiking bills for existing ones on Standard Netflix has gone entirely unnoticed. There almost certainly has been some churn from this, but probably not very much that wasn’t already baked in, and it's been largely counteracted through other, positive initiatives.Meanwhile, T-Mobile has worked to burnish its appeal with real 4G LTE hotspot for its basic plan for the first time, as well as creating a new program to attract subscribers with promises to match discounts on competing carriers. Altogether, I expect it has done enough to counter whatever churn may happen with increased Netflix fees, leaving net growth almost undamaged.No one asked Legere about the changes on T-Mobile’s most recent earnings call. So we don’t have the benefit of any insights or color from management on this issue. But while I don’t think I was wrong to give the matter attention seven months ago, I agree with the prevailing consensus that risk to T-Mobile’s brand from a poorly handed transition or downgrade has largely passed.I don’t regret ending my long seven months ago. Like I said, as it turned out you were better off in an index fund instead of T-Mobile over the past seven months anyway. But put that to one side. T-Mobile does not appear to have suffered any long-term brand damage, despite the publicity its cut in Netflix support received, and that means that this underperformance may represent an opportunity to buy back in, having avoided some relative losses over the past half year. I am - cautiously - going long again for now."

It is challenging to gain investor confidence around regulatory approval of the transactions, given the opposition of various institutions to cut down the number of telco players from four to three.The regulatory opposition is not limited only in the US. Telecom regulators in the Eurozone are opposing several deals that would cut the number of competitors from four to three as well. Such deals include H3G in Italy, H3G/O2 (OTCPK:OTOW) in the UK, Orange/H3G in Austria and TeliaSonera/Telenor (OTCPK:TELNY) in Denmark.The reduction of competition from four to three players would result in a negative impact on consumer welfare and that it would increase prices. It is difficult to conclude that the proposed merger of T-Mobile and Sprint would not experience high hurdles, given these circumstances.Over the last four quarters, one of the major market themes in the US wireless industry has been the acceleration in postpaid subscribers across the sector. This resulted based on the following macro backdrop:Currently, S and TMUS have a combined market share of 40% in the prepaid segment (inclusive of other smaller players). If the S/TMUS deal will be approved, the increase in concentration in this segment will be largely greater than the overall postpaid market.This market hypothesis was justified by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) which measures the impact of a merger vis-à-vis the overall competitive market. The index proved to increase by 1,792 points to 4,585 points, which means that there's a strong tendency that market concentration in prepaid will outpace the postpaid market if the merger will push through.Analyzing the chart below, the prepaid segment appears to be a smaller segment of the wireless market at around 20% of total wireless subscribers. It is considered to be the key focus for regulators with its skew towards lower-income groups.I consider this deeper demographic segmentation would allow postpaid to have a longer-lasting subscriber acceleration. It has the potential to prop up to 27 million subscribers in the succeeding years. However, the main issue here is, will the wireless service providers be able to monetize this growth, given the new threat of entrants such as the cable operators?If the cable operators' entry into the wireless sector would replicate its entry to landline voice like what happened during the early 2000s, the cable operators could obtain 62 million subscribers over time. It would certainly imply a significant impact on wireless service provider growth rates. However, this broader impact would occur in stages, with AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) initially bearing the impact, followed by S and TMUS.S reflected a lower postpaid churn for the second quarter in a row in 2019. The gap widened from the last quarter, which is bigger than it appears to be at 20 to 25 basis points lower for postpaid phone subscribers. This was due to the subsidization of additional non-phone lines, which was caused by intensified competition in the core phone segment.The company has bolstered the number of devices per account to become among the highest in the industry. Thus, it has the highest proportion of non-phone postpaid devices in the sector (at 20% of total). Despite that, its total number of accounts has decreased. This market positioning would create execution challenges for TMUS if the deal is approved. I'm Neutral on S shares with a price target of $6.20.Sprint Stock Price PerformanceSource: Seeking AlphaComcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and VZ are better positioned than their industry peers due to a higher quality mix of subscribers, better execution, scale and cleaner balance sheets. VZ's growth is getting tougher as indicated by its 8.3% year-on-year growth in operating expenses in the second quarter as compared to its service revenue growth of only 3.1%.VZ's new unlimited pricing plans (which lowers pricing by $5 per month) suggest average revenue per user (ARPU) could undergo additional pressure. This may also prompt competitive responses which could be a headwind to pricing across the industry as a whole. I'm a Buy on VZ shares with a price target of $66.Verizon Stock Price PerformanceSource: Seeking AlphaHowever, CMCSA's exposure in the UK's Brexit induced market shocks and resulted in an overhang to its share price. I'm still bullish and recommend a Buy on CMSA's shares with a price target of $55.Comcast Stock Price PerformanceSource: Seeking AlphaTMUS and S announced in 2018 that they have entered into a definitive agreement to merge in an all-stock transaction. Several questions arise that are focused on the integration process and regulatory issues.The trial date for the TMUS/S litigation was pushed out to early December this year. Hence, if both companies are unable to come to a settlement with the states, the deal may not close until the first quarter of 2020.The probability of a deal approval of TMUS/S merger may be higher, but the deal would possibly need large structural remedies to satisfy the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) institutional concerns on the competition. I expect that the approval of this deal with structural concessions could be even better for regulators. It would allow them to change the competitive structure across the telecom space.I noted that the delay in the lawsuit, combined with potentially bipartisan talks to the lawsuit, will put more pressure on both companies to come up with a settlement with the states sooner.The main issue here appears to be the credibility of the solution in considering Dish (NASDAQ:DISH) as a fourth player. I believe that the fall in DISH stock prices since this announcement would complicate the situation. This adverse market situation would drive equity price volatility across the telco sector for the succeeding months. I'm Neutral on DISH shares with a price target of $40.Dish Stock Price PerformanceSource: Seeking Alpha1. Consolidation of InfrastructureThe merger will result in the elimination of TMUS' 35,000 existing cell sites with the addition of 15,000 fewer cells (previously, TMUS planned to add sites on top of the existing sites). Network cost savings from this elimination would represent two-thirds of the $6 billion of run-rate synergies targeted by both companies. A portion of the 35,000 sites that both carriers intend to decommission is related to legacy Clearwire and MetroPCS leases for which they have already received termination notices. Also, these 35,000 sites represent potential churn risk to site operators.2. Cost of IntegrationIn the first three years following the targeted completion of the proposed merger (probably between now and 2021), both carriers expect that they would incur $10 billion out of the $15 billion in estimated costs to achieve a successful integration.In addition to these costs, TMUS' internal projections assume that, by the end of 2021, all S customers would be migrated to TMUS' pricing. The pricing scheme would approximately be 10% lower than Sprint's price plans based on both carriers' reported ARPUs.The hurdle for competitors to try and block a deal in court is possibly high. The regulators may also choose to focus on particular aspects of the proposed merger that may see more immediate market concentration concerns.Now, we will look at TMUS as a standalone carrier to determine the potential pushbacks to the merger.1. Subscriber Trends and Pricing Structure - It has consistently added subscribers than the rest of the industry for more than five years. The company has been undergoing a strategic transformation under its current management. The company's ratio of postpaid to prepaid net additions has accelerated. This is despite the fact that the overall pace of mobile net additions has slowed compared to previous years, which accounted for 50% of industry retail wireless additions.This is a function of changing pricing structures due to the gap in price between the high end of prepaid closing with the low end of postpaid prices. The company's recent rebranding of its prepaid MetroPCS service to Metro by T-Mobile, along with associated changes in the pricing structure for its prepaid plans, would weigh down on this gap further.TMUS has the largest base of prepaid subscribers at 41% of the industry total. Prepaid subscribers account for one-third of TMUS' subscribers, double the base of the industry as a whole. The recent price plans are a way to nudge more value-conscious customers higher up on the pricing spectrum.2. EBITDA - The company raised its adjusted earnings before income tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) target from $12.9 billion to $13.3 billion, which includes estimated leasing revenues of $550 to $600 million.3. Churn & ARPU - The company delivered its all-time low postpaid phone churn of 0.78% in the second quarter of 2019, down 17 basis points year-on-year. This is the third consecutive quarter that TMUS has reported lower churn than T (at 0.86%).Postpaid ARPU declined 1.3% year on year to $46.07, with the year-on-year decline attributed to continued mix shift to all-inclusive offers and success of TMUS' Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) offering ($0.27 year-on-year impact to ARPU). It was offset by fewer promotional activities and higher NFLX price increase.Hence, TMUS is compelled to pass on some or, perhaps, the entire price increases of NFLX to consumers to maintain a satisfactory ARPU. The company is absorbing $200 million annual cost hit due to NFLX.4. Leverage & Free Cash Flow - Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2019 was lower than expected, largely driven by the front-loading timing of capital expenditures for the year. It ended the first quarter with gross leverage of 2.3X and net leverage of 2.2X.Initially, the company guided that capital expenditures would be lower from first-quarter levels. However, the company recently reported that it is no longer anticipating any material upward pressure on capex this year (in relation to its eventual upgrade to 5G). Consequently, TMUS tweaked its capex forecast, indicating that capital spending would moderate in the succeeding quarters, implying capex guidance of $5.8 billion to $6.1 billion for the full year 2019.Source: CNN Business5. Share Buyback - The Board has authorized a 3-year, $9.0 billion stock buyback plan. This is inclusive of the previously disclosed $1.5 billion authorization through 2018, which is already completed. This is equivalent to approximately $74/share. The previous plan was to utilize the $7.5 billion to buy back 12% of the public float, which could serve as downside capital protection. It is TMUS' first-ever capital return program and represents 3% of its total market capitalization.However, the company has suspended any further buybacks at this point due to the merger plans with S, and that share repurchases will not resume unless the deal with S is terminated.Overall, I can perceive that the deal continues to take an unusually convoluted and unprecedented path towards completion with continued lack of visibility on deal framework and timing. Source: CNN BusinessOn the other hand, I believe that 5G and new device launches will change subscriber trends, thus incentivizing consumers more towards smartphones. It thus catalyzes new pricing structures and promotions to drive market share shifts and consequently churn.I'm Neutral on TMUS shares with a price target of $75.10 on EPS of $3.8.Source: Seeking AlphaTo recap, the US wireless market remains to be highly saturated. I believe this proposed merger only exacerbates it. Mergers like this promote downside risks, more particularly high levels of market concentrations which are prone to be blocked by competitors. I argue that, post-merger, consumers will have fewer options for wireless services at higher prices, while service innovation might suffer.At the start, DOJ's opposition to a three-player market is already a regulatory cliché, given the previous rejection of the T and TMUS proposed merger deal. Disregarding political considerations, investors are left with no answers as to why the DOJ would be hostile about having a three (or four) player market. The S/TMUS deal could perhaps be the ultimate starting point for industry disruption.TMUS took the initiative to rebrand its prepaid service. S and TMUS both have now been focused more on the prepaid segment. This segment has also become a very important part of the origination funnel for prepaid subscribers, while pricing between postpaid and prepaid segments has already converged.Investor expectations of broader stability in the ARPU environment may be less visible in TMUS, as the company is now becoming more dependent on mobile video revenue. Unless TMUS decides to initiate to pass some of this cost on to subscribers, then investors will feel less burdened and more confident on its equity shares. This is even more important considering that improvements in churn from present levels would become increasingly challenging even with bundling.All in all, TMUS continues to execute well and leads the wireless industry on growth. I expect that TMUS' stock performance in the near term may be more correlated with underlying earnings growth with less support from valuation increases. Churns are nearing to industry lows, leading to a limited ARPU growth and narrowing gross additions funnel."
4277170,105217,2019-07-24T15:16:58-04:00,"In June 2017, it was announced that Deutsche Telekom was planning to merge its subsidiary T-Mobile US with its competitor Sprint.
        After a first attempt failed, both companies are now in the final phase of the battle for clearance.
        Sprint and T-Mobile US will probably have to make more concessions than both companies initially wanted. In addition, the whole process is taking much longer than planned.","In June 2017, Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGF/OTCQX:DTEGY) announced that it was planning to merge its subsidiary T-Mobile US (TMUS) with its competitor Sprint (S). Due to its rapid growth, T-Mobile US overtook its merger partner Sprint in terms of size and market capitalization. Therefore, Deutsche Telekom continued claimed a controlling majority after the merger. The current owner of Sprint, SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY), would have held a minority interest. Deutsche Telekom is to hold 42 percent of the joint company with 9 out of 14 supervisory board mandates. After a first attempt failed, both companies are now in the final phase of the battle for clearance. The merger will combine two of the four major wireless carriers in the United States, giving the new company nearly 100 million customers and would form a combined company with an enterprise value of about $160 billion. (Source: T-mobile US and Sprint merger)Synergies of the dealWhen Deutsche Telekom took over Voicestream for almost 51 billion dollars in 2000, this step seemed like a colossal mistake. Due to its weak business, Voicestream had long been Deutsche Telekom's biggest problem. Deutsche Telekom even tried to sell VoiceStream but that failed too - from today's perspective a great stroke of luck. It was John Legere who turned T-Mobile US's business upside down, simplified mobile phone contracts, optimized customer service, and successfully launched a marketing offensive. Sprint on the other hand is struggling with a weak business, but has the most mobile phone spectra. Due to the weak business, however, the company was unable to build a functioning network. The merger with T-Mobile would solve this problem. The companies expect synergies with a cash value of around 43 billion US dollars. More importantly, the merger would create new growth opportunities for T-Mobile US. T-Mobile US has experienced extreme organic growth and it was foreseeable that the company would no longer be able to grow on its own with the same growth rate. The new merged company would be closer to the two market leaders and would have a 29.6 percent market share in the USA. The market leader is Verizon (VZ) with 35 percent, closely followed by AT&T (T) with 34 percent. Checking the synergy thesisThe original purpose of the merger was actually very meaningful, which is also evident from the vehemence with which managers of both companies forced the merger over the years. Now that some time has passed, however, current developments may force us to reassess the situation.Given that, the clearance decisions of the authorities were bought at a high price. At the end of May, the telecommunications authority FCC gave its approval - but only on condition that the companies do not raise prices for the new 5G standard and reach 97 percent of the US population with their 5G network within three years. Similarly, the merging parties will have to sell several parts of their business on the US mobile telephony market. If the merger is approved, it's likely to include remedies that give the television provider Dish (DISH) enough airwaves, prepaid customers and network access to emerge as a new national wireless competitor. It is therefore planned that Sprint will sell its Boost-mobile brand. But this is a problem, because if Dish were to enter the wireless market as a fourth wireless competitor, it would very likely put pressure on prices. There is also another problem. Dish equipped with airwaves, prepaid customers and network access could call other players onto the market. In particular, Deutsche Telekom is concerned that Comcast (CMCSA) could then merge with the strengthened Dish. Furthermore, most of Sprint’s prepaid customers are on Boost Mobile. Additionally, Sprint already lost 189,000 contract customers and made a loss of USD 2.2 billion. For Deutsche Telekom integration costs will amount to an estimated 15 billion U.S. dollars which could hurt the ability for dividend payouts. Assuming that these integration costs would spread over 5 years and would burden the earnings for three years (like CFO Christian Illek already expected), the EPS would decrease by nearly EUR 0.63 billion per year to almost 0.07. For now, Sprint cannot compensate for these integration costs. In addition, Deutsche Telekom already has enough problems with rising costs. In May, the 5G auction in Germany raises EUR 6.5 billion from four telecommunication companies, far more than expected. The highest bid came from Deutsche Telekom. Because of this pricey spectrum auction, there are only two ways, either customers will pay more or operators like Deutsche Telekom will have less cash. But cash is necessary to build the 5G networks. Additionally, there are also public legal requirements for the expansion of this network. In this respect, Deutsche Telekom must also invest heavily here. And in capitalism, there is a the fact that you cannot spend money twice. However, it is unlikely that Deutsche Telekom will reduce its investments in T-Mobile US. The subsidiary is too important for the company.Overall, nobody can be really happy with the merger anymore, except Dish. For Dish, the deal is therefore a stroke of luck. T-Mobile US and Sprint are more or less forced to remedies. Dish can significantly expand his business here for a relatively low price. In addition, the company makes itself interesting as a possible takeover target or as a possible joint venture partner.The investor's key takeaway is that Sprint and T-Mobile US will probably have to make more concessions than both companies initially wanted. In addition, the whole process is taking much longer than planned. Accordingly, the meaning of the merger is no longer as clear as it was at the beginning of the merger.I look forward to discussing the merger thesis you in more depth in the commentary section.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on my latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article and check ""Get email alerts"".

4266319,105217,2019-05-24T09:26:35-04:00,"1Q 2019 was great. T-Systems and the US business were particularly positive.Nevertheless, there are some clouds in the sky.5G will be more expensive than expected.Growth in the US market could come to an end in the near future. The merger with Sprint remains uncertain. High integration costs are likely.All this could lead to a dividend decrease.","Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGF/OTCQX:DTEGY) is one of the world's leading integrated telecommunications companies. With T-Mobile US (TMUS), Deutsche Telekom has a remarkable footprint in the US telecommunication market too.(Source: Webpage)In addition, Deutsche Telekom has achieved some successes since 2010 in order to become more profitable.While the first quarter of 2019 was also very successful, it will be more difficult for the company in the future. Hence, I expect a dividend cut next year. However, I am holding onto my shares.But, let me first analyze the good 1Q numbers. After that, I will explain the reasons for the possible dividend cut.Actually, things are getting better and better for Deutsche Telekom. The company recorded earnings growth in all areas in 1Q 2019. Especially, revenues and EBITDA grew nicely in Q1 2019. The highlights of 1Q 2019 were:The company reconfirmed its guidance for the current financial year 2019. Deutsche Telekom expects to report adjusted EBITDA AL of around EUR 23.9 billion and free cash flow AL of around EUR 6.7 billion for the 2019 full year.Operating segments:(Source: Financial results 1Q 2019)AnalysisWhen analyzing the numbers, two things are particularly positive. On the one hand, the T-Systems business is returning to sustainable growth.(Source: Financial results 1Q 2019)This is driven by two effects, one is the basis in Q1 2018 was really weak, but the company is also making progress when it comes to cost reductions. In the conference call, the CFO assumed that management has roughly, if everything has been being finalized, a cost saving of 400 million in the German footprint that would include T-Systems as well on an annual basis. So after all, the Systems Solutions business is on track.On the other hand, the US business is still impressive. T-Mobile continues to grow strongly and raised its guidance for 2019 branded postpaid net adds towards a new range of EUR 3.1 million to EUR 3.7 million, another 300,000 more.(Source: Financial results 1Q 2019)As I stated above, it will be more difficult for the company in the future. The two main reasons are:5G auction in GermanyGermany was scheduled to hold the 5G auction by the end of March and was expecting to raise up to EUR 5 billion.More than two months in, the auction is shaping up to be one of the longest on record with 405 rounds completed so far. Until now, the auction has attracted bids worth more than EUR 6 billion.Since the announcement that 1&1 Drillisch will bid too, the stock performance has been partly disastrous. However, Deutsche Telekom has made still the best development.(Source: Disappointing performance in the telecommunication sector)Nevertheless, industry participants have expressed concern that the bidder race would inflate costs. Furthermore, the high costs could undermine the ability to invest the billions needed to build the 5G networks.Exactly, this is to be expected in Italy. Because of a pricey spectrum auction last year, there are only two ways, either customers will pay more or operators will have less cash. But cash is necessary to build the 5G networks. Additionally, there are also public legal requirements for the expansion of this network. The operators are, therefore, obliged to invest. Inevitably, higher costs for consumers remain the only viable option for operators.Confronted with the higher auction costs during the conference call, the Deutsche Telekom's CEO hinted that this problem also applies to the German market.(Source: Conference call results 1Q 2019)Additionally, due to its footprint in Europe, Deutsche Telekom has to invest not only in Germany and Italy, but also, for example, T-Mobile Austria's investments reached a new record high of EUR 229 million in 2018. Between 2018 and 2021, the company will invest a total of around EUR 1 billion only in Austria to ensure efficient mobile and fixed broadband infrastructure.Competition in the US marketAnother problem is the US market. While it is still going very well and T-Mobile is contributing a significant share to the profit of the Deutsche Telekom, it will not be able to go on forever with this growth.Accordingly, T-Mobile will be able to grow sustainably in the long term only through acquisitions or mergers. Therefore, T-Mobile is trying to merge with its competitor Sprint (S). T-Mobile and Sprint first announced plans for a merger last year. The merger will combine two of the four major wireless carriers in the United States, giving the new company nearly 100 million customers.(Source: Financial results 1Q 2019)Unfortunately, things are not really progressing and there is still no real news as to whether the merger will be approved or not.This is what the CEO has to say on the current status of the merger:Investors must, therefore, wait at least until June for new information. But what is already clear is that the merger cost money. From my profession, I know how much effort and time such procedure costs. Especially, the legal advice can devour sums.Deutsche Telekom was always a generous dividend payer. In recent years, the dividend has always been raised. In 2019, the company paid almost EUR 3.3 billion to its shareholders.(Source: Dividends since 2005)In addition, in 2019, the dividend payout was around reasonable 75%.Regarding further dividend increases, Deutsche Telekom has already announced that the dividend will follow growth in adjusted earnings per share. At the moment, the EPS is projected to rise to EUR 1.20 by 2021, an increase of 20 percent.(Source: Full year results 2018)I am expecting that the further business development will hurt the ability to pay the same or even higher dividend in the coming years because the adj. EPS should be far more less than expected. There are two reasons for this:Higher than expected auction costsThe higher than expected auction costs are affecting the entire sector. That's why the first companies had to cut their dividends. Because the cost of building out a 5G network forces Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) to shore up its balance sheet, Vodafone has already cut its full-year dividend by 40 percent.1&1 Drillisch unveiled a plan to cut dividend payments for its latest fiscal year if it secures allocations in the ongoing 5G auction. The dividend would reduce from EUR 1.80 to EUR 0.05 per share.Deutsche Telekom has repeatedly emphasized that it is financially very well positioned. However, the auction is not over yet and the final costs are not foreseeable. The necessary investments will definitely weigh on the balance sheet.Integration costsNevertheless, for Deutsche Telekom, another singular factor is added, namely the merger with Sprint. Integration costs will amount to an estimated 15 billion U.S. dollars which would hurt the ability for payouts further. The actual guidance is not including the Sprint deal at all.Hence, Deutsche Telekom is accordingly restrained regarding further dividend hikes. Furthermore, the company is expressively vague in terms of the exact dividend amount:(Source: Official press release)Assuming that these integration costs would spread over 5 years and would burden the earnings for three years (like CFO Christian Illek already expected), the EPS would decrease by nearly EUR 0.63 billion per year to almost 0.07. For now, Sprint cannot compensate for these integration costs. In the first quarter, Sprint made a loss of USD 2.2 billion. In addition, it lost 189,000 contract customers. Given that the Deutsche Telekom has already announced that the dividend will follow growth in adjusted earnings per share, a cut would be inevitable.After all, a dividend of at least 50 cents per share is set. That would still correspond to a dividend yield of over 3 percent.No likely scenarios avoiding a cut in case of a successful mergerOn the other hand, in case of a successful merger, there are not any likely scenarios that could lead to the company avoiding a cut. The forecasts regarding the EPS were always relatively accurate. On the contrary, the auction costs are already above the estimates. Other telecommunications companies have already completed the dividend cut.Additionally, it is not clear in which area the Deutsche Telekom wants to surprise in the future positively. This applies above all to the disproportionate growth of T-Systems because the comparison is mainly based on a weak quarter in Q1 2018. Further surprisingly, strong growth in this segment is, therefore, not expected. Sprint's numbers were weak too, accordingly, no support is expected here either.Deutsche Telekom is still a very well-run company. It prepares for the future by investing in the future. Given the opportunities offered by 5G, it is a good sign that Telekom is investing massively here. The potential merger with Sprint also offers, despite integration costs, in the beginning, further growth potential in the US market. Furthermore, it is always better to act out of a strong position. The comparison with the competitors has shown that Deutsche Telekom is still the most stable company in the German telecom sector.Nevertheless, auctions cost and expected post-merger costs make a dividend cut very likely. Management has already announced that the dividend could be cut to 50 cents. But even then, Deutsche Telekom would have a dividend yield of over 3 percent. Similarly, a return to rising dividend payments after the investments in 5G and the merger could be likely in the 2020s.All these are good signs for the long term. Hence, I am keeping my shares even with a dividend cut ahead."
4267717,104582,2019-05-31T19:36:53-04:00,"Despite a recent pullback, there might be way more pain in store for investors if the DOJ rejects the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.Like Tesla, T-Mobile has very light ETF ownership, making it potentially more volatile and less liquid.That could have a major impact on the stock price in the event the merger isn’t consummated.","(Source)Tell me if this sounds familiar; a large and well-known company, led by a charismatic CEO with a flair for branding, disrupts a mature industry dominated by a handful of big players, consequently sending its share price to new heights and making itself the darling of the investment community? Yes, it's an investment trope so common and occurs with such cyclical regularity that Howard Marks should write a book about it, but we'll give you a hint. The stock begins with the letter ""T."" If you guessed Tesla (TSLA) you were close, but we were talking about T-Mobile (TMUS), which, like Tesla, is another large-cap stock led by a strong CEO who has managed to defy the skeptics and deliver substantial returns for investors despite not being in the largest market index, the S&P 500. Of course, the tale of Tesla has taken a dark turn, and recent events have us wondering if T-Mobile is about to follow it down the rabbit hole.Comparing T-Mobile to Tesla might seem a big stretch, given the obvious differences between the two companies, but they do share one very important attribute generally overlooked by investors. Both are excluded from the S&P 1500, which populates S&P's size and style universe, among the most common reference indexes in the ETF world and, most importantly, in this case, the S&P 500. Just three funds linked to the S&P 500 - SPY, VOO, and IVV - have over $500 billion in assets, or 1/6th of all ETF assets in the U.S. Being locked out of those funds makes Tesla and T-Mobile underowned by ETFs relative to other companies of their size, and while that might not hurt their stock prices in the short term, it has other consequences, side-effects which could hurt their investors, especially if the market begins to turn against their story.We will be the first to admit that ETF ownership is probably pretty far down on the list of things most investors watch for before hitting the ""buy"" button, although we expect that attitude to change as ETF assets continue to grow, thanks to their combination of low fees and high liquidity. And, with over $3.8 trillion in ETF assets in the U.S. alone, they are taking over a vital role in the marketplace.It would be nice to argue that the primary benefit of high ETF ownership is price support, but a more readily available benefit is providing both liquidity and a volatility cushion, especially when your investment thesis is being challenged. ETFs are well known for being ""informationally insensitive"" investors in that their transactions are typically dictated by the creation and redemption of shares along with periodic rebalancings or reconstitutions that follow a known, set procedure. They buy when they have to and not off of a portfolio manager's whim, which makes them suppliers of liquidity to the market, helping reduce the volatility from active investors. Of course, investors typically don't care about liquidity or volatility when the general price trend is in your favor, but it's something they crave when the story goes the other way.Consider Tesla which we talked about in a post in early March called ETF Inclusion Of Tesla: Profits Over Production, where we discussed how the company's exclusion from S&P 500 had reduced the percentage of its market cap owned by ETFs by almost 50% compared to its rivals. The impact was probably only marginal at best when Tesla was still in the rapid growth phase of the business cycle that investors love. The promise of rapid growth and industry domination, and the subsequent increase in the value of the company, likely had a far bigger impact on share price than widespread ETF ownership. No matter what else you might think of Elon Musk, the man certainly knows how to promote, and for a brief time, Tesla was worth more than either Ford (NYSE:F) or GM (NYSE:GM) despite producing only a tiny fraction of the cars they could make in a year.As mathematician Blaise Pascal once said, ""The heart has its reasons which reason knows nothing of…""But while it may not have offered much price support, higher ETF ownership (or perhaps broader is a better term) might have helped dampen some of the volatility TSLA investors have endured over the last few years. According to Morningstar, TSLA has a three-year historical volatility (here using standard deviation of returns) of 38.38% compared to 10.82% for SPY and 22.95% for General Motors through 4.30.19.You can see in the chart below what that kind of high volatility can do to the share price of a company. Violent moves in both directions as the stock endured a multi-year trade range which included steep drawdowns that would have left an investor who went long at the start of the period at the breakeven point. In fact, investors had been poorly compensated even before Tesla's awful showing at the start of 2019 as a GM shareholder would've see almost the same return but had to endure one third less volatility in the process.In fact, TSLA and GM have both seen an increase in the number of outstanding shares held by ETFs so far this year although with some significant differences in who was doing the buying.Since our March 8th article through May 24th, ETFs have increased their ownership of Tesla by nearly 700k shares, a roughly 6.1% increase even as the price cratered by over 32%. That may sound like a much-needed dose of life support until you consider that Tesla's average daily trade volume is nearly 11.5 million shares, which makes that 700k share increase slightly more than 5% of what the stock trades every day. And, the bulk of it didn't come from passive funds mindlessly supplying liquidity but from a series of actively managed ETFs from Ark ETFs with one fund, the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) increasing its investment in Tesla by over 300K shares in that period. So, that boost in ETF ownership wasn't the result of a quarterly rebalance or formulaic investment program but an opportunistic investment that can be sold as quickly as it was bought.By contrast, GM also saw a boost in its ETF ownership measured by shares held during that same period of roughly 6.6% although, unlike Tesla, it largely came via passive funds that already held it, but there was a new allocation of over 5 million shares by iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY). DVY only reconstitutes itself annually, making this a long-term position in just one of several dividend funds that hold GM, and if the market continues to lose steam or trade sideways, could dividend funds be big winners from new asset flows?So, how is any of this relevant to the investment prospects for T-Mobile? After all, T-Mobile has continued to pound higher in 2019 where it's now up 35% YTD compared to just under 8% for the iShares Telecommunications ETF (IYZ) and has stretched its three and five year annualized returns to levels that Tesla fanboys can only dream of!A picture may be worth a thousand words, but for the more mathematically inclined, T-Mobile has delivered a three-year annualized return of over 21% compared a negative .3% for IYZ and even stretching it to the five-year mark, the annualized return for T-Mobile is still over 17% compared to just 1.5% for IYZ!What's even more impressive is that T-Mobile has done this while having a relatively small amount of its outstanding shares held by ETFs with just slightly more than 3% in the hands of 124 different funds. By comparison, GM has roughly 10% of its shares held by over 181 equity funds, including those S&P 500 replicators, and which we just showed have been taking down more shares as investors begin looking for defensive equity alternatives.Of course, the reason why T-Mobile is doing so well has little to do with ETF ownership and everything to do with the fact that it has posted strong subscriber growth in a mature and highly competitive market thanks to the leadership of a very charismatic leader, John Legere. With his magenta shirts and outsized personality, he's been able to use a mix of promotions and price cuts to undermine his rivals and help T-Mobile more than doubled its subscriber base since the beginning of 2013 while maintaining profitability as its 1Q 19 earnings report announcing a new record for EBITDA (T-Mobile Reports Accelerated Customer Growth, All-Time Record-Low Churn, and Best Ever Q1 Financial Results) points out.But if you look at that cumulative return chart of T-Mobile versus the broader market, you'll see that the stocks upward movement had been seriously restrained by the spring of 2018. Seeking Alpha's dedicated T-Mobile watchers could probably identify any number of reasons for the flagging performance such as whether the company could continue to meet growth projections or the emerging threat of cable companies entering the wireless market, but one thing is for sure, the announcement of an all-stock merger with smaller rival Sprint (S) has been well-received by the market! We'd assume it's because the rationale for the merger, the need to achieve economies of scale to build out a 5G network, makes sense to the market along with investor confidence in Legere, and investors have boosted both stocks up over 30% this year, but unfortunately, they aren't the only ones who matter.Those recent events that we alluded to at the start of this update have to do a series of articles about T-Mobile's upcoming merger with Sprint, a combination of the #3 and #4 telecommunications companies that promises to deliver the economics of scale both need to survive in a 5G world. This isn't T-Mobile's first appearance in the merger rodeo. It's been a perennial merger target or partner, first with AT&T in 2011 and then with Sprint in 2014, but this is the first time that it's gotten approval from one of the two necessary bodies to seal the deal. Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission has publicly come out in favor of a merger as benefiting customers with the Department of Justice has indicated that it has serious doubts about whether a bigger T-Mobile would mean less competition, and higher prices, in the mobile market.After all, the reason they've tried this dance before is because it failed to work the first time. Back in the early-Legere era, Sprint and T-Mobile tried to merge and ultimately failed for exactly the same reason that an attempt by AT&T to buy T-Mobile failed in 2011, market competition. The telecommunications industry is a textbook case of an industry that demands a tremendous amount of capital just to maintain operations, which makes achieving economies of scale incredibly important but would also seem to inevitably lead to a marketplace with only a few competitors. Reluctant to cede price setting ability to Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T, the Department of Justice and the FCC have historically rejected any attempts by the big four to merge their way to a monopoly. Buying up a smaller competitor like MetroPCS, sure, but try to achieve market domination and you're asking for trouble.That logic sunk AT&T's buyout of T-Mobile in 2011 although the fact it has since managed to thrive while also putting downward pressure on industry prices seems to have confirmed the DOJ's logic, but the question is whether a merger is any more acceptable now than in 2014? T-Mobile is certainly sparing no expense to make the deal happen, including booking multiples nights at various Trump-owned properties when its executives come to D.C. to pitch their deal! Reports have been flying that DOJ might nix the deal unless a series of measures are agreed to, including spinning of enough assets including valuable spectrum to set up a new fourth telecom company, seemingly defeating the very purpose of the deal!Being forced to spin-off assets, or surrender spectrum to the government to be distributed to a potential tie-up of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) would leave investors to ponder a very sad, but ultimately very Tesla-like moment, what do you do when your investment fairy-tale comes to an end? Judging by their share prices, investors have been putting their hopes into a merger and if that is blocked, does that leave the #3 and #4 telecom companies without a strategy and facing serious capital outlays for their 5G networks?Well, it might look a little something like this, where T-Mobile is in danger of sharply underperforming both the S&P 500 this week, thanks to the rumors swirling that the DOJ might insist on some serious changes to the merger terms to let the deal happen.How far T-Mobile might fall depends on ""invested"" the market is with the merger story.Now, all investor expectations are tied up into a single story, strength through merger, which, along with Tesla-like light ETF ownership, has us concerned that investors could be in for serious disappointment although with the big difference that T-Mobile is at least profitable and not overly levered, so it has some room to maneuver. Still, you can see in the chart below that T-Mobile has traded much more in line with a mega-cap rival like Verizon since the merger was announced, so much so that it's had a significant impact on volatility.T-Mobile may have distinctly light ETF ownership but is the company more volatile than AT&T or Verizon over a longer-term time period? In fact, the immediate answer is surprisingly no as the volatility (measured by standard deviation of weekly returns) over the last three years has been relatively tame for ranging from 17.53% for Verizon to 18.18% for T-Mobile according to our friends at Morningstar.com. But if you look at a longer time frame before merger mania took charge and you get a different story. T-Mobile's trailing five-year standard deviation is upwards of 25% higher than either of its larger rivals clocking in at 20.95% compared to 16% for AT&T and 17% for Verizon. That can be hard to visualize until you consider the returns of the stock over the last five years.Everyone loves volatility when your price is going up, like in 2013, when T-Mobile more doubled in value, and again in 2015 and 2016, when T-Mobile was up over 45% per year! But what about when the trend is going the other way like in 2014 when it lost 20% of its value? Just like Tesla, T-Mobile can have periods of sharp moves in both directions, thanks to the lack of liquidity and volatility cushioning that comes from higher ETF ownerships.That's why when investors stretch their gaze to the ten-year annualized returns, T-Mobile's performance looks decidedly less impressive, outperforming IYZ by 140 bps annually, but at the price of substantially higher volatility. According to Morningstar, IYZ had a 10-year historical volatility of 15% versus almost 40% for T-Mobile! Long-term investors need some serious intestinal fortitude to stick with a stock like that and which is why we're worried that most aren't seriously considering the possibility that the merger might not happen.So, is it time to run screaming from T-Mobile? That depends on how well you can read the DOJ and whether they'll finally give their blessing to this, but the more important lesson is that investors always need to be aware of who's supplying the liquidity that keeps spreads reasonable and volatility low and whether they'll continue to be there if and when the story that drives the stock price starts a dark chapter."
4265824,95916,2019-05-22T13:44:53-04:00,"I'm still skeptical of the S/TMUS merger since DOJ, not FCC, was always the primary obstacle, and they have not signaled approval.The surge in S stock on FCC approval only seems to me premature and overbought.I explore an options strategy for betting against this surge, which I consider to be superior to a straight short under the circumstances.","Two months ago today, I wrote an article recommending ending long positions on Sprint (S) stock while it was trading in the mid-$6 range because I saw an increasing probability of the market waking up to the merger’s murky prospects. The advice was good at first, as Sprint stock fell 17% from that level as the Department of Justice’s concerns became more and more public. But in the last few days, Sprint has completely reversed, now trading above $7.Like everything involving Sprint stock these days, it’s all merger related. A week ago, new rumors began buzzing that Sprint and T-Mobile (TMUS) were considering making further concessions to save the deal. Just a few days ago, the FCC chairman announced that the concessions had been made official, and that he would now recommend approval of the deal.Despite this news, I'm not convinced to go long in Sprint, which still has about $1 worth of upside left in it if the merger is approved, a potential 14% gain. Over just a few months that would be considerable, but I'm still skeptical of the merger, so I will be exploring a different trading strategy.My view that the merger is in jeopardy has not changed, because as other contributors have already explained, it was always DOJ, not the FCC, that posed the greatest obstacle. Though the FCC’s defection is certainly newsworthy, I do not view it as pivotal. DOJ is reportedly still skeptical of the consumer gains.Still, these gyrations mean that Sprint stock seems to me now better suited to an option trade than a straight up long or short. I intend to stay out of the stock itself while purchasing some put options as a potential gain if the merger is denied.This will allow me to cap my downside if the merger is approved, since I will only be out the premium. The potential downside from simply shorting from here is currently about $1, before accounting for any further upward movement by T-Mobile stock. I will be examining options that all have a defined downside of no more than 60% of that.Because I think that we are in the endgame stage of this, one way or the other, I'm looking for relatively short-term options, but I would like a little cushion in terms of timing so that if DOJ does drag this out, they won’t expire on me before the market takes the hint and reprices Sprint back to its “merger-doubtful” or even full-blown “merger blocked” levels. The latter, as I said in my previous article, is probably somewhere around $3. The former is maybe more like $5 or a little below, since I believe that the stock will fall below previous levels on a second dip. If I’m wrong about that, “merger doubtful” may be more like $5.50.At the time of this writing, the option chains for Sprint put options were looking like this:The strike prices are on the left and the expiration month is on the top. Right away, we can rule out a couple of options, as the market is currently charging no extra premium for extending a $5 put from November to January and is actually charging less for a $4 put in November than it is in August. These are American options, so that's not really logical, but the options market in general is a little less liquid and a little less logical than the stock market itself. At any rate, these are the prices I'm being quoted, so this is the decision I have to make.I also think that the extra premium is sufficiently small to extend $6 from November to January that I’d be silly not to take it. Finally, the relative pricing of the puts in January sort of puts $4 January out of the running. Since the cost of $4 puts in January increases to one half of $5, from one third in November, the stock would have to run down below $3 basically before the $4 could actually yield more gain than the $5 on a percentage basis. Since I think $3 is the floor, there's basically no possible upside to the $4 January, making the extra protection the $5 January offers essentially free.I’ve marked the ones that are mathematically eliminated in red, and the ones that are mathematically just barely possible but not really worth it in yellow. The green are the remaining, viable choices for an investor, depending on exactly where and when they think the stock will fall.So the real choices are between a $4 put expiring in November or the $5 or $6 puts expiring in August or January 2020.The $4 put in November seems to me to be almost perfect in timing, but the strike price is concerning. My $3 price target got quite a lot of pushback, and if in fact that's reflective of market sentiment and the stock does receive some support before hitting that level, I might guess right about Sprint’s direction and still lose the whole value of the option.A $5 put seems to me to offer extra protection that's well worth it, but that raises the question of timing. August seems to me to be cutting it a little close, while January 2020 is probably paying extra for time I don’t need. While DOJ’s lawsuit probably won’t have gone to trial by then, assuming it's filed, the market will presumably reprice Sprint in light of the lawsuit well before January, since filing the lawsuit could happen anytime, and almost certainly will happen in the next few months at most.August is probably the more logical bet, but that's cutting it just a little close. Theoretically DOJ could still be in negotiations at that point, and it would be a shame to see the option expire just before an announcement sent Sprint plunging back down. The cost of extending by six months and tripling the lifetime of my option is only 33%.Ultimately, forced to choose I opted for a January 2020 option. Now, with $4 out of the running at that time, the only choice is $5 or $6. To keep $4 in the conversation I will use the November $4, since I think November is more than enough time also. We are using January for $5/$6 only because it's basically free once we leave August behind. I will be assuming identical capital at risk for all options.A $5 option at $0.35 cents means that it will be in the money at $4.65, but the real question is of performance relative to the alternative. A $6 option at $0.58 will begin to accrue gains much sooner, so the $5 option will not begin to outperform the $6 put option until the Sprint stock price goes considerably below the in-the-money level. Since I can buy 58 $5 puts for the same amount of money as I can buy 35 $6 puts, the $5 puts will start $3,500 in the hole at $5 per share, and recoup $2,300 for each additional dollar per share drop in Sprint stock between now and January 2020.I’ve reproduced the numbers in the table below. Strike levels are on the left, final Sprint stock trading prices are on the top. Note that the $4 row is a little riskier for any given payoff since it has an earlier expiration date. The values presented all assume a $2,030 capital allocation, rounded to the nearest whole contract for each strike level. That's 35 $6 contracts, 58 $5 contracts, or 169 $4 contracts. They are proportionally identical, however, for any given amount of capital at risk. The numbers are payout numbers only, to get net profit you subtract the $2,030 initial premium payment.As you can see, it takes quite a while for the $4/$5 puts to become a better deal. In fact, they don’t move ahead of the $6 at all until $3.48 per share, and the additional gains even at $3 even only come to $11 for the $5. $4 gains start much later but scale up rapidly owing to the much lower cost base.The $5 puts extra gain is less than one third of the benefit $6 puts provide at the $5 level. Meanwhile, the $6 not only lead for most of the path, they also offer at least some upside above $5 stock price, which is where a wobbly, prevaricating DOJ could presumably leave it. Only if T-Mobile abandons the merger rather than fight the DOJ in court will the stock plunge anywhere near $3. And many of my readers believe it won’t go that low even then.The primary downside of the $6 puts, of course, is that they simply cost more. But that's only relevant if we conduct a single-contract analysis, ie., if I decided I was only buying a single contract either way. That would reduce my losses in the event that the merger goes through by almost half, from $58 to $35. A single $4 contract would take my losses all the way down to $12.But most investors enter an option transaction to bet a specific amount of money, not to buy a specific amount of contracts. Assuming an investor is going to bet the same amount of total money, the payoffs on the $6 are much better in almost all circumstances and start to kick in much earlier. The bet will become in-the-money on the $6 at $6.42 per share per Sprint, a level it was trading at as recently as a few days ago before the FCC news broke.I consider options better for this trade because they cap downside on further movement in T-Mobile stock at a level that's considerably below downside for shorts in the event of merger approval even at current T-Mobile prices. Admittedly, this means that upside doesn’t kick in as fast as a straight short would, but the downside move on a merger block is likely to be so severe that the potential for Sprint stock landing in that no-man’s land of $6.42 to $7.22 is virtually zero.Given that I don’t see the stock going below $3 even with the merger blocked, and perhaps not quite reaching that level, the $6 January looks best to me, although there’s an argument to be made for the $4 November if my original assessment of a $3 or so stock price post-merger block was correct. Reader response to that was overwhelmingly skeptical, however, and I'm taking that to heart, offering readers a strategy that incorporates a slightly more optimistic view of Sprint in even a non-merger scenario."
4265635,22148,2019-05-21T17:29:07-04:00,Sprint rallied on apparent FCC approval of the merger with T-Mobile.The DOJ remains the major roadblock with antitrust concerns around competition in the sector on the reduction to only three wireless competitors.The stock is at risk of returning to 2016 lows on a blocked merger.,"Sprint (S) initially surged more than 25% to recent highs near $8 on signs that the merger with T-Mobile (TMUS) would get approved by U.S. regulators. Eventually, reality set in as the Department of Justice hasn't changed its reported stance against the merger. The investment thesis hasn't changed that the stock faces substantial weakness from a blocked merger that remains a high risk.Image Source: Sprint websiteSprint jumped to new highs based on the FCC chairman tweeting his approval of the merger. The FCC has always looked more at the closing of the digital divide in rural America and advancing global leadership in 5G as priorities.For this reason, the FCC appears set to approve the merger with commissioners Mike O'Rielly and Brendan Carr apparently set to back the merger based on these general commitments.The problem for Sprint shareholders and the reason the stock fell toward $7 for only an 18% gain on the day is that the DOJ hasn't changed its apparent stance against the merger. As recently as April, the WSJ reported that the Justice Department was against the merger for antitrust issues. Apparently, nothing has changed and the FCC is not working in conjunction with the DOJ on the above commitments from T-Mobile and Sprint.In fact, Marketwatch highlights a host of issues that the DOJ is likely to balk on the merger as the U.S. having global 5G leadership isn't reliant on a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile. Further, analysts such as Chris Mills from Tutela believe the merger would be devastating to consumers in the long run.Sprint recently traded as low as $5.50 following the most recent blowback from the DOJ. The market doesn't appear to have paid attention by losing focus on the one regulator and its problems with the merger.The recent FQ4 results confirm the problem with the merger and why the DOJ might eventually be forced to relent to a combination. Sprint saw net post-paid phone losses of 189,000 in the quarter to lag the sector.The problem is that Sprint can't afford postpaid phone losses like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon. The wireless laggard burned more than $900 million in cash last FY and had limited operating income.The worst-case scenario of a merger breakdown appears inline with the Citigroup estimates that Sprint would be valued at $3 per share. The wireless laggard has a large debt load and is struggling to even reach break-even.The key investor takeaway is that Sprint is a major gamble with more than 50% downside risk on a blocked merger to where the stock traded in early 2016. The DOJ appears set in a tossup situation favoring keeping the four carrier system alive where the low-cost alternative wireless carrier remains in the market. The stock just isn't worth the risk above $7."
4265808,48311,2019-05-22T12:41:09-04:00,T-Mobile and Sprint appear to have secured FCC approval.The DoJ remains a big question mark.I expect the DoJ will ultimately side with the FCC.,"Yesterday things were looking very good for the T-Mobile (TMUS)/Sprint (S) deal after news came out the FCC approval is pretty much a lock. The DoJ does not share this enthusiasm so far. It is rare that one OK's a deal and the other opposes it. I wrote Sprint up in the Special Situations Report back in early April and publicly as recent as May 1.Most negative rumors in the past were related to the DoJ and it has a more straightforward focus on competition. But it has a broader view than you might think as evidenced by Delrahim's interview with David Faber from a while back. Here Delrahim says the DoJ considers different factors in this case like:1) Whether there will be a price effect in consumers' landline and in their broadband (because of 5G). This calculus could work out favorably for consumers because via 5G, there is new competition emerging in the broadband market. Higher expected prices in wireless could be offset or trumped by lower ones on broadband.2) If the DoJ expects a coordinated effort not to compete that's a negative. I think the presence of T-Mobile CEO Legere may be a factor in this consideration. He's winning market share from AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ). He calls them dumb and dumber consistently. He's just really charging T-Mobile forwards and certainly doesn't give the appearance he's going to give them a break once the merger closes. His un-carrier campaign may actually carry the day here, as well as with consumers.3) According to Delrahim, it also matters to the DoJ whether 5G develops without this merger. The DoJ is considering this question as part of an inquiry into whether consumers will reap some of the expected efficiencies. Sprint and T-Mobile have been pushing the argument they need this merger to develop 5G. However, it seems there would be other (albeit uncertain) paths towards 5G development. Keep in mind I'm not an expert on this. My reading of the arguments and facts is that this merger is important to ensure a competitive 5G landscape. Without this merger, the wireless landscape is clearly more competitive as is. However, considering a forward landscape factoring in the emergence of 5G, it is the more uncertain route towards maintaining competition.The divestiture of the Boost segment contingent on the merger is new and previously not taken into account by the DoJ. I'm not sure at all the DoJ is going to side with the FCC on this as things stand. But it does now seem much more plausible to me that the merger will close perhaps with some other guarantee or divestiture.I've taken the odds of a successful close up to 85%. At the same time, the downside for Sprint is still to around $4 (opinions vary). The result is the expected value of this situation is slightly positive and about 9% annualized. The raw spread is still 8.75% pre-market 5/22/2019.Image: M&A dashboardIf you believe the odds of closure are 83%, the expected value at $7.34 becomes positive. If you think the probability of closure is 89% or higher, the annualized expected value of the merger goes into the 20% territory. It is easy to be wrong about the probability of closure/downside/upside etc. which is why I struggle to clearly see what the best path forward is.I lean towards holding onto long Sprint and short T-Mobile. Meaning, I think that's slightly better than selling out of the position. The downside is fairly intimidating so keep that in mind. I think I could easily have the probabilities of closure too low but struggle to see how the odds are significantly below 80% given the information we have now."
4263910,95916,2019-05-14T14:45:35-04:00,"T-Mobile's merger continues to be belabored by regulatory scrutiny.The company also appears to be leaning towards modifying or even terminating its partnership with Netflix.This could potentially inflict a real blow to the brand of T-Mobile with its customers, in turn shifting investor sentiment in a negative direction.At least in the short term, I see headwinds, and have ended my long position in T-Mobile. I will keep an eye for a chance to buy back in at some point.","Last year, after staying away from T-Mobile (TMUS) for almost three years, I recommended again going long on the stock. Over the succeeding year, it has risen roughly 14%, but the key issue hanging over the stock now is the merger with putative rival, Sprint (S). That seems to be driving virtually all of the trading in Sprint, and a substantial portion of the trading in John Legere’s company as well.There’s enough analysts spilling ink over T-Mobile’s merger situation that I didn’t feel it would be helpful to rehash it again. But I did want to go over another issue that I think has been somewhat overlooked in all the merger speculation. And it involves another of T-Mobile’s partners. A partner who may be inadvertently threatening one of T-Mobile’s biggest assets, its brand cache with consumers.As most investors probably know already, Netflix (NFLX) has conducted another price hike, this one even more substantial than the last. It’s Standard and Premium plans (two and four streams) are going up by $2 each, and for the first time ever, its Basic plan is going up $1. For the first time since launching streaming as a separate service almost a decade ago, Netflix has no streaming plan priced at $7.99. The rate hike also applies in countries where Netflix denominates its price in US dollars, such as most of Latin America, though not Mexico or Brazil.The price hike will take effect for existing customers in May, though apparently not until the end of May. I am a Netflix subscriber myself, and I am currently showing one last month at the old price on my billing page. At any rate, prices are going up soon. Probably no later than the end of the month, since I have already received notice about a pending increase. I am probably not an atypical customer.Other contributors have already examined the impact of the hike on Netflix itself. But the impacts extend beyond streaming video providers. This price hike also has significance for T-Mobile, which launched its Netflix On Us promotion as part of its Uncarrier Revolution in September 2017. Under the deal, T-Mobile covers the cost of a Netflix Standard plan (two-stream plan with HD) and members may choose to upgrade to a Premium plan (four-stream plan with 4K) and pay only the difference out of pocket. The Netflix promo is only available to family plans (two lines or more) and customers have to be on the latest T-Mobile ONE plans.At the time Netflix launched the promotion, the Standard plan cost $9.99 per month, which meant that T-Mobile was essentially sending $10 out of the $120 a two-line family plan was sending them right back out the door. Expensive, but for a company with high-fixed costs, worth it if it attracted customers in large numbers, which it apparently has since T-Mobile’s growth has only accelerated since then.The downside, however, is that the deal contained no restrictions on what the price of Netflix would be in the future - Netflix would never have agreed if it did - and consumers generally expect companies to maintain their services. This leaves T-Mobile in the position that is a little uncomfortable like those of traditional pay-TV companies like AT&T (T): its content suppliers can hike prices behind the scenes and leave them to do the unpopular part of, in turn, hiking prices on actual consumers.What makes it even worse in T-Mobile’s case, however, is that it isn’t even a middle-man so much as a patron for consumers - it promised subscribers free Netflix, not to re-sell them Netflix. And because it has made Netflix On Us a major part of its marketing for almost two years now, it has become an intrinsic part of the Un-carrier branding. And it just keeps getting more expensive.Netflix has already conducted one price hike since then, a single $1 increase across all plans. T-Mobile covered that increase to maintain the Netflix On Us promo. T-Mobile says that “for now” it will cover the cost of this second, larger hike itself as well. This was only supposed to be binding until May 1st; however, T-Mobile said it was “in discussions” about what will happen after that.From the fact that May 1st has come and gone with no announcement, we can infer that discussions are still ongoing, and presumably are not yielding entirely satisfactory results thus far.By no means is it all doom and gloom for T-Mobile, but there is a substantial problem for its brand here. Essentially, it must either continue to absorb price hikes itself or reverse itself on a major Un-carrier initiative, and its brand power has been built in no small part on the endurance of the latter.T-Mobile could also decide to cover the plan with a premium for the Standard plan, much as it already does for the Premium plan. Since Netflix only cost $10 when T-Mobile started out, and T-Mobile already followed the first price hike up to $11, it could continue to supply the same $11 and tell customers they are on the hook for the difference. The $11 would still be enough to cover half the cost of the upgrade from Basic to Standard, and if customers didn’t want to do that, they could still have the Basic plan fully covered.But again, the question becomes how much damage to T-Mobile’s brand would this do? Technically, they would still be offering free Netflix, but customers would almost certainly notice the decay in the quality of their streams. While we are only talking about a few dollars per month for T-Mobile, investor sentiment could turn if T-Mobile decides not to stretch its own budget to maintain its commitment to its customers and suffers a brand hit. And the length of the talks suggests T-Mobile is not willing to simply take the hit.It might be objected that this kind of thing simply won’t happen, because the carrier’s management is sincerely opposed to treating the customer in this fashion. But as I’ve noted before, T-Mobile has always raised prices whenever they thought they could get away with it. They tend to retreat from such price hikes only when such increases get too much press attention, threatening their un-carrier image; or when competitive pressure from another low-utilization carrier (that would be Sprint) makes hikes untenable.There have been hikes of more recent vintage, as well. T-Mobile raised the price of its 55+ plan to $70 from $60. Not long after, T-Mobile discontinued offering its discount option KickBack on all T-Mobile ONE plans that hadn’t already signed up for it, essentially hiking prices on low-data lines by $10 per month per line. Accounts already approved were grandfathered, though.In other words, T-Mobile hikes prices, but only when it thinks it can do so quietly. A Netflix On Us reversal would not necessarily be quiet.As an investment, T-Mobile has served me well for the last year and change, but merger uncertainty is rising and the trade war is becoming a drag on the market in general. I was prepared to tough it out, but this other problem on top of everything else has me thinking that at least in the near term, T-Mobile could hit a bump. With the stock above $74 as of this writing and a near-15% gain in a year, I’ve decided for now to take some chips off the table and end my long on T-Mobile. I still think it has long-term potential, but I am looking to avoid some near-term downside and perhaps buy back in later at a better price."
4265609,42661,2019-05-21T16:18:03-04:00,"In April 2018, Sprint and T-Mobile agreed to merge in a deal valuing Sprint shares at about $8.26 per share.Regulatory opposition has stalled the deal, leading it to near death.On May 20, 2019, T-Mobile submitted the commitment for the companies to build out the 5G national network along with expanded coverage in rural and under-served areas.The commitment to the network buildout has flipped the FTC and FCC from against to now in support of the deal.DoJ remains opposed to this deal, but the companies remain committed to reaching an accommodation with Justice or ultimately beating it in the courts.","Special situations are opportunities to invest where money is likely to be made regardless of which way the existing status unfolds. They usually arise from activist shareholders pressing management for changes or from arbitrage of pending merger/takeover deals. The Sprint (S)-T-Mobile US (TMUS) deal presents such an arbitrage special situation at this time.This situation has been long simmering since April 2018 when the two companies originally announced a merger agreement had been reached. This agreement has simmered for more than a year while the markets remained pessimistic concerning regulatory approval. The regulatory impasse was broken after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and Commissioner Brendan Carr converted from concerned to supportive when the companies agreed to a binding commitment to build out the 5G network and expand the reach throughout rural and other under-served parts of the U.S. within 6 years.Yesterday, May 20, 2019, T-Mobile submitted the formal filing setting forth these guarantees. Markets greeted this resurrection of the deal that had been thought long dead by trading shares up to near final value of the merger offer. Sprint shares rose to close at $7.34 on 5/20/19, just $0.92 cents below the approximate $8.26 value set for Sprint shares by the merger offer.The Department of Justice is the last regulatory hurdle remaining and is reported to still oppose the deal in its latest current form. The DoJ has a very poor track record in opposing these consolidation deals of late and both companies continue to assert their willingness to be flexible in working to meet DoJ concerns. Given the shifting regulatory sands of support towards favoring the deal, the flexibility offered by the two companies, and the fact that if this deal were to fall apart, both companies would end up selling off in whole or parts eventually, it is very likely the deal will ultimately be completed. The real question is how quickly any remaining objections within DoJ can be cleared.Given the likely ultimate closure of the deal providing a $8.26 value to Sprint shares, along with the renewed momentum provided by settling issues with the FCC and support by the FTC, the special situation pricing of Sprint put options offers attractive yields to consider. It is likely that this arbitrage opportunity will be able to be rolled forward month to month at double-digit annual yield rates for quite some time also.A special situation arbitrage trade to consider at this time consists of writing cash secured puts at strike prices below current market (which is also below the $8.26 Sprint share merger value). One example would be to write the cash secured puts on the 31-day 6/21/19 $7.00 strike @ $0.52 premium. This provides an annualized yield rate of 94.48% on net covering cash of $6.48 tied up for the 31-day period. Lower strike prices provide smaller option premiums and less yield rate but may also be within an attractive range.Should shares be presented, your net cost basis will be $6.48 (9.9%) below current $7.19 market. The ultimate deal values Sprint shares at $8.26 and there will be opportunities for writing covered calls at or above the $7.00 put strike basis up to or beyond the $8.26 deal value even. Additional future forward rolls of the cash secured puts will be available at very attractive yields while the deal continues to resolve itself towards completion.Thank you for taking the time to read my work.

4221145,101850,2018-11-11T20:38:16-05:00,"Key developments from T-Mobile's 3Q results.Subs rose across the board, but postpaid phone and data impressed in particular.Prepaid sub adds were significantly below estimates of the Street.Postpaid ARPU held steady in spite of strategy to add value-oriented customers.5G rollout in 2019, 600-Mhz deployment ongoing, prospects looking bright.","Post-3Q, T-Mobile (TMUS) looks like an interesting bet in the wireless space. It continued to gain market share and add more subscribers with net adds in both postpaid and prepaid. Its ARPU held steady, falling much less than what analysts had expected it to. While there is uncertainty regarding its proposed merger with Sprint, which is under regulatory review (Source: New York Post article), T-Mobile is expanding its network with 600 Mhz deployment, allowing it to penetrate new geographies. Considering the upcoming 5G rollout and the quality of T-Mobile's existing network, things look exciting for T-Mobile in an otherwise slow and dull industry.(Source: FactSet)Postpaid subs rise as T-Mobile targets new profilesT-Mobile is riding the rising industry postpaid adds trend, continuing to add subscribers in the segment. The bonus is that it is also capturing the majority of this industry-wide growth. Firstly, it has been targeting customers with military backgrounds and those of age groups 55 and above for its value plans. Secondly, the investments which T-Mobile made on expanding its LTE network (and 600 Mhz deployment) are enabling geographic expansion. And thirdly, it has also performed well in adding business/enterprise clients. These three areas of focus have led to an increase of 774k phone subs and 305k data subs in the postpaid segment.A reasonable chunk of the postpaid growth can also be attributed to wearable devices such as Apple watches. Such devices will grow in significance in the future and there is a good chance that non-phone will be a key driver to sustaining growth in the near future.While adding subscribers is a net positive, T-Mobile has also controlled its churn rate well. Churn in the postpaid segment was at 1.02% in 3Q18, in line with the prior trend of declining churn rates over the last 9 quarters. One key reason for the lower churn rate is its expanding network coverage, continuous network improvements, and prudent management of sub-prime customer exposure.(Source: Nomura)Losses from non-paying customers have been kept down per the graphic below:(Source: Earnings release)Postpaid ARPU for 3Q18 was $46.17, down from $46.93 in 3Q17. Given T-Mobile's focus on value plans and sub-prime customers, analysts had expected ARPU to underwhelm. The stabilizing ARPU delivered by T-Mobile this quarter is definitely a positive sign.While ARPUs for most players in the industry have actually increased in recent times, T-Mobile has focused on subscriber growth through value plans at the expense of ARPU. But even when viewed over the longer term, ARPU has been quite stable around the 46-46.5 mark, which is a reflection of the conscious effort that T-Mobile has made to keep ARPU from rising.(Source: Earnings release)Prepaid adds were 35k, far below the consensus estimate of 142k. Prepaid ARPU was also marginally down at $38.34 (vs. $38.93 in 3Q17). While migration from prepaid to postpaid might be one reason for the tepid performance, T-Mobile has not been convincing in its efforts to prop up prepaid. While it had re-branded ""Metro PCS"" to ""Metro by T-Mobile"" in order to push up prepaid subs, the rebranding exercise hasn't quite paid off thus far. Meanwhile, T-Mobile's competitors such as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have been increasingly aggressive in signing up prepaid subs, compounding T-Mobile's prepaid struggles.T-Mobile is in the midst of deploying its 600 Mhz network along with a 5G network buildout set for 2019. If the merger with Sprint (NYSE:S) goes through as planned, the combined entity will have a much stronger balance sheet to leverage, particularly important as we enter the age of 5G while service levels should also benefit as a result. Should the merger fall through, T-Mobile remains a key 5G beneficiary which bodes well for phone and non-phone revenues going forward. 5G developments are key and remain a very interesting space to watch.T-Mobile also acquired the TV platform Layer 3 in an effort to bundle video/TV services with its future 5G offering. With Layer 3, T-Mobile is expected to compete in 52% of US zip codes for home broadband and TV customers. Such capabilities allow T-Mobile to offer a complete suite of broadband solutions which boost phone as well as non-phone revenue for the company. Given the saturated nature of the smartphone market and the slowing wireless industry, such new avenues of growth are what will ultimately determine the winners and losers as we enter a new cycle. And T-Mobile, we feel, is well positioned.As T-Mobile sets out to grow its subscriber base through its Value Plans, a higher sub-prime contribution could lead to higher churn rates in the postpaid segment going forward. To mitigate this risk, customer's credit quality will have to be balanced with growth needs.Additionally, the intense competitive pressure is something investors will need to get comfortable with. The telecom industry is highly competitive and AT&T for instance, could very well respond to T-Mobile's Value Plan strategy by introducing its own leasing plans and ""Unlimited Data"" plans, which could take market share away from T-Mobile.Lastly, a failed merger between Sprint and T-Mobile could adversely impact both entities' competitive positioning going into the 5G era.T-Mobile looks to be in a pretty decent place with its 5G plans, its stellar LTE network, and its video and home broadband strategy. While it is difficult to predict which way the merger decision goes, it does make a lot of sense on paper and would be a game changer for T-Mobile if it does go through. Leaving aside the merger though, T-Mobile (standalone) has performed better than most of its competitors and looks attractive at these levels going off its 3Q18 performance."
4227347,104565,2018-12-10T03:14:56-05:00,There is a robust bull/bear debate regarding whether the T-Mobile/Sprint merger will receive regulatory approval.T-Mobile strongly argues that a merger is needed to create a competitive third carrier with a national 5G network.Bears point out that similar iterations of this deal have been rejected multiple times and that there is considerable risk given the high foreign ownership.Wall Street analysis and the market indicate 50/50 odds of approval at best.This article will analyze both sides of the debate and cover ways to invest in the different likely outcomes.,"The proposed merger between T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) is one of the most contentious deals of 2018. There is a robust bull/bear debate regarding whether the deal will receive regulatory approval. Proponents of the deal advocate that if T-Mobile and Sprint merge, they will have the capital and spectrum needed to successfully launch a nationwide 5G network and compete on an equal footing with AT&T and Verizon. However, prior attempts to merge T-Mobile/Sprint/AT&T have been opposed by regulators. The market has pinned the odds of the merger succeeding at 50% or less. While I agree with the merits of the deal, I also tend to agree with the market that the deal is at best a 50/50 outcome. In this article, I will provide a detailed assessment of both sides of the for/against debate. At the end of the article, I will outline a few different strategies investors can employ to invest given the different outcomes.On April 29th, T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) announced an all-stock merger. Under the agreement, each Sprint shareholder would receive 1 T-Mobile share for every 9.75 shares of Sprint owned. This implied a $6.62 share price or a 1.8% premium to Sprint’s prior closing share price at the time the deal was announced.The new company will retain the T-Mobile name and existing T-Mobile CEO John Legere will remain CEO of the combined company. The majority shareholder of both companies, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY), will roll over their equity stakes into the new company. Public shareholders will own the remaining 30.9% of the company.Source: T-Mobile M&A Presentation April 29, 2018.From a shareholder perspective, the merits of the deal are solid. The deal is being sold as the best hope for the US to get a competitive market for 5G service. Telecom is a business where competitive advantage comes from economies of scale and spectrum. T-Mobile and Sprint argue that without a merger, the two carriers simply do not have the economies of scale or spectrum to deploy a 5G network. I believe the facts back them up on this claim; however, that’s not necessarily the determining factor that would result in regulatory approval.Source: The Washington Post.As it currently stands, T-Mobile is the third-largest US wireless carrier with 58 million customers. Sprint is a distant fourth with 40 million. However, the two combined would overtake AT&T to become the nation’s second-largest carrier by wireless customers. This is a game changer for the entire industry. For years T-Mobile has marketed itself as the “uncarrier” and has taken market share by discounting prices. Consumer advocates (and the DoJ) worry that a combined T-Mobile/Sprint could firm up pricing because the company would no longer need to aggressively take share to gain economies of scale.As already mentioned multiple times, economies of scale is crucial in this industry. T-Mobile believes it can achieve $6 billion in annual cost synergies. The company stated that 93% of the projected synergies would come from operating expenses (fixed overhead, retail store consolidation, reduced advertising spend, and more) while the remaining 7% would be capex synergies.However, it would take 3-4 years to achieve all these synergies. The first challenge is that only half of current Sprint customers have handsets compatible with the T-Mobile network; therefore, Sprint customers using CDMA technology would need to be migrated to VoLTE. Second, mobile phone plans are complicated, often containing multi-year provisions and warranties. It will take time to fully transition mobile phone plans and the staff supporting those plans. Finally, there would need to be significant network capital investments. The company estimates that an incremental $10 billion of capex would need to be invested in the network to support current customers under a shared infrastructure.The last important advantage relating to economies of scale is balance sheet strength. T-Mobile has a strong balance sheet. TMUS is net levered 2.6x and has an investment grade credit rating of BB+. Sprint, on the other hand, is net levered 2.5x but has a junk tier credit rating of B. T-Mobile’s bonds currently yield around 5.5% while Sprint’s yield closer to 7.25%. A 175-basis point spread on tens of billions in bonds really adds up. T-Mobile projected the combined company would be net levered at 2.9x immediately after closing the deal but projected that the company could de-lever below 2.0x net leverage within 4 years. The combined company could achieve significantly lower borrowing rates given the additional asset coverage and cash flows.A strong balance sheet will be extremely important in the coming years. Significant capital will be needed to make the upgrade to 5G. Furthermore, mmWave spectrum auctions are ongoing. Additional spectrum is critical to securing a future in next-generation wireless network technologies and it will not come cheap.Speaking of spectrum, T-Mobile and Sprint independently do not have adequate spectrum to launch a nationwide 5G network. Sprint has the right mid-band spectrum while T-Mobile has the right low-band and mmW spectrum. The two spectrum portfolios complement each other well, providing strong strategic rationale for the merger. It would be exceedingly expensive for either of the two to acquire the missing spectrum needed.Source: T-Mobile M&A Presentation April 29, 2018.In my opinion, the strongest argument that the currently proposed T-Mobile/Sprint deal will not receive regulatory approval is that numerous iterations of this/similar deals have been blocked. Back in 2011, Obama’s DoJ blocked a merger between T-Mobile and AT&T (NYSE:T) on anti-trust concerns. In 2014, the FCC signaled concern over a potential merger between T-Mobile and Sprint which ultimately killed the deal before it was formally agreed upon.In 2014, Sprint/T-Mobile argued privately that a merger was needed because of how hard it was to compete against Verizon (VZ) and AT&T. Former FCC Chairman Wheeler expressed skepticism that an industry consolidation from 4 to 3 would be beneficial for the consumers.The current argument from Sprint/T-Mobile is somewhat derivative of the 2014 argument regarding difficulty to compete vs. Verizon and AT&T. However, the new spin to the argument is that the upgrade to 5G will not be viable for the two carriers as they are currently situated. Therefore, if they are not allowed to merge, they will not be competitive with AT&T and Verizon in the coming years due to a network disadvantage.What makes this argument hard to swallow is that despite not consummating mergers in 2011 or 2014, T-Mobile has thrived. From 2011 to the end of 2017, T-Mobile’s total customer count has more than doubled from 33.2 million to 72.6 million. T-Mobile has achieved that growth through discounting wireless plans. T-Mobile’s postpaid ARPU declined from $57.56 in 2011 to $46.97 in 2017. In other words, US wireless consumers benefited from an independent T-Mobile, validating the DoJ’s arguments.The other key argument for why the current T-Mobile/Sprint deal will be blocked has to be due to foreign ownership. In the Trump era, foreign ownership over US technology and telecom assets has faced significant scrutiny. A recent example is the ire over Huawei and ZTE telecom equipment. Furthermore, several proposed M&A deals have been rejected on foreign ownership grounds.As noted earlier, the majority shareholder of both T-Mobile and Sprint are foreign entities. A majority foreign ownership would continue to be the case after the deal is closed. It is safe to say that CIFIUS will take a close look at this deal. Some argue that this deal will receive CIFIUS approval because it actually dilutes the foreign ownership. The reality is that foreign ownership is another wild card element and we simply do not know exactly how it will be viewed by regulators.An unsettling development for the merger is the killing of Jamal Khashoggi and SoftBank’s ties to the Saudi Royal family. Fortunately, Sprint is not one of the investments in the SoftBank Vision Fund, but the connection alone could draw unwanted political attention.The key argument for the deal comes down to competitive dynamics and the prospect of having a third carrier with a 5G network. Without rehashing what I wrote earlier, I agree with T-Mobile’s competitiveness arguments regarding 5G. The New York Post reported in August that the FCC and DoJ may also be sympathetic to this argument. This provides a glimmer of hope but is really just a rumor at this point.The other key argument being made by T-Mobile/Sprint is that the competitive landscape has widened due to the convergence of media and telecom. I previously described this phenomena of media/telecom convergence as it relates to my bull thesis on Verizon. To summarize, cable TV, cable internet, wireless carriers, and media companies are becoming vertically integrated to provide differentiated consumer offerings and benefit from cost synergies. T-Mobile argues that as a result of this trend, it now also competes with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR). In fact, Comcast added more wireless phone subscribers last year than AT&T. Therefore, regulators should view the competitive dynamics of this merger with a different lens than they viewed prior deals.To make this deal more politically acceptable, T-Mobile/Sprint claim that the merger would create jobs and result in up to $40 billion in new network investments in the first 3 years. The company also pledges to keep both headquarters offices open after the deal.Finally, part of the bet T-Mobile and Sprint are making is that the deal has a better shot of getting approved within the context of the pro-business Trump administration. It was the Obama-era FCC/DoJ that rejected prior wireless mergers. Some see Trump-appointed Ajit Pai as being much more amiable towards megadeals such as the one being proposed.Market participants and Wall Street analysts view the likelihood of this deal being approved at or below 50%. The below survey from Citi Research shows a 36% likelihood of the merger being approved.The current deal price for Sprint implied by taking T-Mobile’s most recent share price of $65.69 (at time of writing) and applying the equity consideration ratio of 0.10256 is $6.74. Sprint’s share price is $6.01. This implies a 12% deal spread. Given that there is no financing risk (all-stock deal) and no risk of shareholders voting against the deal, a 12% spread is quite wide and implies that the market doesn’t see a high likelihood of regulatory approval.When it comes to handicapping the odds of a deal, I tend to agree with what the market is saying. In this case, I also agree that the deal has at best a 50/50 chance of approval. While I find the 5G competition argument compelling, the regulatory track record in blocking very similar deals is somewhat damming. Given that there is no break-up fee (unlike the AT&T/T-Mobile proposal), it appears that T-Mobile also doesn’t have a high degree of confidence in approval.For investors interested in expressing a position in this situation, there are essentially 3 ways to invest.Merger ArbitrageFor those interested in betting on the likelihood of the deal getting approved (and this truly is a speculative bet), one could go long Sprint and go short T-Mobile with the appropriate deal ratio: 9.75 shares of S for every share of TMUS.If the deal is approved, the 12% spread will narrow. However, if the deal is not approved, the two stocks would likely move against you and you could suffer a fairly large loss.Based on the probability of the deal closing, I would not recommend this strategy.Long Sprint or T-MobileI believe this merger would be a very good move for the combined company if it gets approved. New T-Mobile would be able to compete on an equal footing with AT&T and Verizon and would benefit from significant cost synergies.If the deal gets approved, you can buy the new T-Mobile stock at a discount by owning Sprint. When the deal closes your shares will be converted into new TMUS shares. If the deal does not close, Sprint shares will likely fall; however, I don’t think they would fall very much because the market already puts low odds on the deal closing. Furthermore, as a standalone investment, Sprint is attractive. Sprint trades for just 4.4x forward EV/EBITDA, this compares to Verizon at 7.2x and AT&T at 6.5x. I would caution investors that Sprint is a higher risk investment due to its inferior balance sheet.Investing in T-Mobile stock is a safer way to play the merger for the long term. If the deal gets approved, T-Mobile would benefit from the financial and strategic synergies. If the deal is rejected, T-Mobile is still a well-run wireless carrier that is taking market share. T-Mobile trades for 6.4x forward EV/EBITDA, making it more expensive than S but cheaper than T and VZ.Reader Note: This is a continuation in my series covering the telecom industry.

4230037,80536,2018-12-24T14:39:28-05:00,"T-Mobile is undergoing a massive merger with Sprint and this promises to change the pricing dynamics and service offerings for the entire telecom industry.The T-mobile merger with Sprint is at a very good time because of the needed investment in 5G technology and thus this is very welcome.Though the merger makes sense, we still have to watch how well T-Mobile CEO executes the post merger integration for a catalyst on how to trade the stock.","T-Mobile US's (NYSE:TMUS) stock needs to be on a watch list right now because of the post-merger integration with Sprint (NYSE: S) which is still ongoing. The stock became more attractive because of the Trump tax cuts, but the post-merger integration needs to play out before any plans for purchasing the stock.T-Mobile US is a mobile telecom operator based in the US, and it is a subsidiary of Deutsche Telecom. It currently has 71 million customers in postpaid, prepaid and wholesale markets. The current incarnation of T-Mobile US was formed from the merger with Metro PCS in 2013.T-Mobile US’s gross profit margin remained flat from 2014 to 2017 because the cost of services and cost of equipment remained flat. T-Mobile’s operating profit margin improved from 2014 to 2017 thanks to faster increases in sale than in selling, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization. The sales increases were due to increases in branded postpaid and prepaid revenues and increases in equipment sales. Additionally, T-Mobile’s pretax profit margin increased from 2014 to 2017 due to interest expenses only increasing slightly, but revenues increased faster. T-Mobile’s net profit increased from 2014 to 2017 due to increased sales and positive effect of tax cuts, as described earlier, and the company’s effective tax rate resulted in a tax benefit because of the positive effect of tax cuts in the United States in 2017. Returns on assets, equity and capital employed all improved from 2014 to 2017 thanks to increased profitability. Profitability is going to increase with the merger with Sprint, and it's going to give the resulting company after the merger scale and pricing power against AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ).T-Mobile US’s debt ratio remained flat from 2014 to 2017, but remained high because of high long-term debt, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The company’s interest coverage improved from 2014 to 2016 due to improved profitability, and its financial leverage remained flat from 2014 to 2016.T-Mobile US’s price-to-book value increased from 2014 to 2017 because of stock price appreciation, which was due to increased profitability during this period. The company’s price-to-earnings ratio increased from 2014 to 2016 because of stock price appreciation due to increased earnings, although the market priced further earnings as increasing in appreciation. Hence, the stock price increased faster than the earnings, but the price to earnings ratio decreased in 2017 because of the sharp increase in earnings. T-Mobile US’s dividend was very weak from 2014 to 2017.T-Mobile US's merger with Sprint would create a strong network that can battle AT&T and Verizon as the industry moves to 4.9/5G services in the US. This 5G service is obviously going to require significant investment; hence, the need for the merger with Sprint. So far, Verizon is ahead of the game in 5G deployment and T-Mobile/Sprint will need to conclude their merger quickly and accelerate the deployment of 5G services, which, when deployed, will bring in increases in earnings, and hence, a more attractive stock valuation for the newly merged company. 5G wireless technology is going to increase speed and responsiveness of mobile telecommunications. Also, this will spur innovations, including driver-less transportation, that need lots of reliable communications to function properly."
4242077,69965,2019-02-19T11:20:34-05:00,"John Legere of T-Mobile is saying the right things. Competition in one area and an even playing field in another gives this merger a chance.Most mergers involve one strong and one weaker company. T-Mobile is the ""haves"" and Sprint is the ""have nots,"" the picture has never been clearer.The new T-Mobile promises a lot, but there are risks to spending on new stores and customer service.The risk arbitrage play isn't good enough to risk buying Sprint stock.","Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you are probably aware that T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE: S) are attempting to merge. I say attempting to merge, because the deal was announced near the end of April last year and the deal isn’t done yet. Investors should realize we’ve been down this road a few times before. In 2011 AT&T wanted to acquire T-Mobile and that didn’t happen for fear of eliminating competition. In 2014, Sprint and T-Mobile wanted to get together, and once again anti-competitive issues caused the deal to be abandoned. The wireless landscape has changed dramatically, and this deal seems to have a chance to be completed. With that in mind, there only seems one reasonable way to play this trade: own T-Mobile.Investors can tell John Legere (T-Mobile) has been rehearsing his lines. The number of video spots, articles, and analysis about the merger has increased, due to Legere and Marcelo Claure (Sprint) meeting with Congress to discuss their plans. While Claure looks every bit the businessman in a standard suit and tie, Legere is living up to his maverick roots wearing a T-Mobile shirt underneath a suit jacket.There are several punch lines that Legere is using repeatedly to remind everyone why he believes this merger is beneficial.When asked the obvious question about the wireless industry going from 4 carriers down to 3, he quickly responds that “It’s expected that Comcast and Charter Communications will take five million wireless customers in the next two years.” He points to offering 5G both mobile and home broadband service as a key reason for the tie-up. In addition, he is touting that the combined company will bring competition to broadband where, “48% of American households have no choice when it comes to home broadband.” Legere is bound and determined to convince anyone who will listen that this merger is good for the economy and for consumers.(Source: T-Mobile coverage)(Source: Sprint's coverage map)When it comes to the process itself, the merger has already received approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. While the FCC and Department of Justice still need to approve the merger, T-Mobile says it expects to receive regulatory approval in the first half of 2019.Of course, with any merger there are going to be doubts and questions. One of the holes in the wireless competition theory is Comcast’s ambitions ride on the back of the Verizon network. Since Comcast doesn’t own its own network it must rely on Verizon to provide the service and compliment this with thousands of its Wi-Fi sites. Charter also has an agreement with Verizon to use its network. While it’s true that Comcast and Charter represent competitive threats, ultimately Verizon is still involved. In addition, unlike the traditional wireless carriers, Comcast and Charter only offer wireless service to existing customers. Though each company has millions of customers, this isn’t a true nationwide threat like Sprint and T-Mobile.Even with these caveats, regulators may have to deal with having three very large wireless competitors in order to gain real competition in the broadband industry. A merger that creates competition in one industry and evens the playing field in another, is likely a story that regulators can ultimately accept.It’s not unusual when companies merge to see one as stronger than the other. In the T-Mobile and Sprint merger, this dichotomy is clearly presented. T-Mobile is firing on all cylinders, whereas Sprint seems to be treading water hoping for this merger to go through.In T-Mobile’s most recent quarter, several items stood out. First, the company’s postpaid churn was lower than AT&T at 0.99%. This is quite an accomplishment as many would perceive Verizon and AT&T as the standard for the industry. John Legere has been vehemently disagreeing with this stance for a while, but a lower churn rate than AT&T speaks volumes about customer satisfaction.Second, T-mobile’s service revenue increased once again. Third, the company grew its postpaid total customers by nearly 10% year-over-year, which is no small feat in an industry widely believed to be mature. Last, T-Mobile generated about $1.2 billion in core free cash flow, while investing to expand its network and dealing with the noise around the merger.If T-Mobile is the “haves” then Sprint is the “have nots.” Sprint’s last quarter had a few highlights, but even these pale compared to its merger partner. “Postpaid service revenue grew year-over-year for the first time in five years” Sprint said on its conference call. Unfortunately, prepaid challenges caused overall service revenue to decline by 4% year-over-year. Sprint’s postpaid churn was nearly double T-Mobile at 1.85%. Though Sprint’s other challenges are bad enough, the company’s cash flow is potentially the biggest issue. Between capital spending on network and capital expenditures for leased devices, Sprint’s core free cash flow was negative $2.3 billion during the last quarter.In short, what investors are looking at is a company that is thriving and growing (T-Mobile) and a company that is struggling to stay relevant (Sprint). Investors who are hoping this merger goes through also need to look at the several challenges facing the “new T-Mobile.”When two companies want to merge, management will make promises to try and improve its case for the merger. Some promises come in the form of veiled threats about what could happen if the merger isn’t approved. Often, the most repeated promises surround job creation, better prices, and increased competition. What investors need to pay attention to is how some of these promises could affect the new company’s prospects in the future.(Source: T-Mobile and Sprint merger page)On the negative side, Sprint is being very clear about what it believes happens if the merger isn’t approved. Marcelo Claure said, “Sprint would need as much as $25 billion to build a 5G network as a standalone company.” Given that Sprint is forecasting negative free cash flow for 2019, the company wouldn’t be able to generate this from operations. What regulators may pay more attention to was his statement that, “the company’s total debt of $40 billion and no free cash flow would lead to higher prices for consumers if it’s not allowed to combine with T-Mobile.” The bottom line for Sprint, is without the merger it won’t be able to compete and stay price competitive. Keep in mind, those are Claure’s words not my opinion.On the positive side, we’ve already covered some of the promises Legere has made about more jobs, but what could that mean for the “new T-Mobile?” The company says, “we plan to open 600 new retail stores and up to five new customer care centers… making this merger job positive from day one.” Though some don’t like to think about it this way, new jobs means new expenses, and it begs the question, what have the two companies been doing up until now?T-Mobile has been on a streak of adding more than 1 million postpaid subscribers quarter after quarter. Sprint just saw postpaid connections grow just over 2% annually in its last report. If the theory is that each company is trying to win customers, why the need to open 600 new stores? What this doesn’t address is two big issues. First, what about the situations where a Sprint and T-Mobile store are within spitting distance of each other. In my hometown for instance, there is a T-Mobile store in a shopping plaza and a few doors down there is a Sprint store. There is zero chance the new T-Mobile keeps them both, so are these 600 new stores, net new or just replacing other sites that will close?A second consideration is five new customer care centers means a significant investment in what I refer to as non-revenue generating jobs. I’ve personally worked in customer care and sales in multiple industries. Unless these representatives are very good at cross-selling or up-selling customers, this could be a net expense to the new T-Mobile. This begs the question, why does the new company need these new centers? If T-Mobile has enough service representatives for its customer base, and Sprint has enough for its base, why would a merger necessitate five new centers? As we can see, there are multiple questions here without easy answers.With new stores and call centers comes more expenses. Some of these expenses will show up in the SG&A line item, some in capital expenditures and elsewhere. It’s a simplistic comparison, but in the last quarter T-Mobile generated $1.2 billion in core free cash flow, while Sprint reported a negative $2.3 billion (if we include capex for network and leased devices as we should). If we combine the companies to just hit a breakeven for free cash flow, the new T-Mobile would need to find about $1.1 billion in costs to take out on a quarterly basis. Obviously, the new company would target efficiency and there are certainly overlapping jobs, but keeping this merger job positive while cutting billions in expenses per year isn’t guaranteed.To be blunt, the only way to play this potential merger in my opinion is through T-Mobile stock. There are several reasons I believe this is the case. First, using Sprint stock to play the risk arbitrage game doesn’t seem to make sense. On the positive side, for every Sprint share you get 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile. At present, T-Mobile shares trade for $72.05, while Sprint is priced at $6.30. The exchange at these prices would value Sprint at $7.39, or a premium of about 17%. While this might sound like easy money, the risk versus reward just isn’t great enough.As mentioned before, Sprint’s own Claure essentially said the company has tons of debt and no free cash flow. If the merger isn’t approved, he also said that the company will have to raise prices. Let’s assume for a moment this plays out and Sprint must raise prices to compete. The carrier is already struggling with postpaid churn relative to its peers and at aggressive prices. If Sprint raises prices in light of a failed T-Mobile deal, there is little question this churn rate will increase. Another buyer may come to the table, but after Claure’s comments before Congress, there is little reason to expect a substantially better offer for the shares.A second reason to own T-Mobile is the stock’s growth profile. The company has, “19 consecutive quarters leading the industry in year-over-year service revenue percentage growth.” This last quarter was the “23rd straight quarter of more than 1 million total net customer additions”. T-Mobile’s operating margin is 9.6% versus Sprint at 5.6%. T-Mobile is free cash flow positive to the tune of more than $1 billion as of the last quarter. Maybe most importantly, there is a huge share buyback if T-Mobile does not complete the merger with Sprint.An overlooked portion of T-Mobile’s first quarter 2018 earnings, explained how the company would proceed if the Sprint merger did not go through. When talking about share repurchases, T-Mobile said:The bottom line is T-Mobile is a fundamentally stronger company than its partner. If the merger doesn’t go through, shareholders will be theoretically rewarded with billions in share repurchases. If the merger does go through the new T-Mobile has a chance to compete in the 5G world against Verizon and AT&T. In the game of roulette, there is an old school line that says always bet on black. In the case of the T-Mobile and Sprint merger, I would only bet on magenta."
4220466,69965,2018-11-09T13:38:41-05:00,"T-Mobile's equipment revenue spells an opportunity for the company in the future.The company can do better when it comes to SG&A expenses, if it does there is an $800 million opportunity to cash in on.Layer3's timeline seems to have been pushed up, have investors noticed?","T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) has been a stock picker’s best friend for the last six months. After trading in the mid-$50s several months ago, the stock has risen to above $70 today. The shares have dropped back a few times, giving investors a chance to jump in. Though significant press has been devoted to whether the company will end up merging with Sprint, there are multiple ways T-Mobile can improve its existing business. Though the shares are trading near their 52-week high, long-term investors have a huge opportunity staring them right in the face, regardless of how the Sprint deal plays out.T-Mobile is known for growing its service revenue at a pace that exceeds the industry. However, one way the company can continue its climb, is by addressing what seems to be a disconnect in its equipment revenue. The biggest carriers in the industry, AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ), may not be able to keep up with T-Mobile in service revenue growth, but their equipment sales seem to be outpacing the “un-carrier.” Looking at T-Mobile’s equipment results over the last several quarters shows a troublesome trend.(Source: Q1 2018 – Q2 2018 – Q3 2018)Just as a quick point of comparison, while T-Mobile’s equipment revenue increased by 12.9% in the current quarter, AT&T posted an increase of 19%, while Verizon grew by 23%. One of the reasons for this disconnect in equipment sales, may be T-Mobile has a significantly higher percentage of prepaid customers than its larger competitors.It’s no surprise that prepaid customers are more fickle and they may not opt for the best and most expensive equipment. All three of the carriers we’ve looked at, said that higher priced equipment was part of how they grew equipment revenue. T-Mobile has just over 21 million pre-paid customers, AT&T has just under 17 million, and Verizon has just 4.7 million.T-Mobile’s re-branding of Metro PCS, as Metro by T-Mobile, comes with multiple cheap phone options. At present, Metro customers can get an iPhone SE, or different mid-level phones, by Samsung, LG, and Motorola. Though the phones don’t cost T-Mobile as much as say a free iPhone Xs, giving them away for free causes equipment cost to rise without any increase to revenue.The good news for T-Mobile investors, is the company is growing its postpaid customers at a faster rate than prepaid. In the most recent quarter, T-Mobile’s postpaid customers increased by 11%, while prepaid increased by 2%. In addition, T-Mobile is seeing strong porting results against other carriers. In the last four quarters, the porting ratio has moved from 1.4 in the first quarter to over 1.7 in the current quarter. Given that T-Mobile has nearly double the number of postpaid customers, and they are growing at a faster rate, suggests equipment sales will be less of a drag on results over time.The second way T-Mobile can continue its run, is by aggressively looking at its costs and bringing them in line with the competition. The company has an opportunity to improve its operations, specifically by improving its spending on SG&A.In the most recent quarter, AT&T and Verizon’s SG&A as a percentage of revenue came in at 21% and 22% respectively. By comparison, T-Mobile’s SG&A expense has been running over 30% of revenue for the last few quarters. Though some might attribute this higher level of SG&A, as expenses related to the pending merger with Sprint, this simply isn’t the case. In fact, T-Mobile said that merger related costs came to $53 million in the current quarter. Considering the company spent over $3.3 billion in SG&A expenses during the same time frame, the merger simply isn’t to blame.T-Mobile said in its conference call, that SG&A was related mainly to higher employee related expenses and commissions. This has been a consistent theme, and clearly T-Mobile has some work to do. The difference of roughly 8% in SG&A spending, equates to an over $800 million savings opportunity. T-Mobile needs to attack this line item, because the potential Sprint merger will likely cause the expense to balloon next year.The third way T-Mobile can continue its run, is by running as fast as it can to capitalize on its Layer3 acquisition. Layer3 offers a service it refers to as “the new cable.” T-Mobile has already made it clear that 5G is the company’s next big opportunity. However, what some investors may not appreciate, is how quickly 5G could lead to additional revenue in the TV business.Right now Layer3 is only offered in a limited number of areas, yet hints from the company’s conference call suggests this business will expand faster than originally indicated. Michael Sievert the COO of T-Mobile, seems to have pushed forward the TV timeline. Last quarter, he said, once the company offers broadband services, “you can offer the TV on top of it.” This seemed to suggest TV would coincide with nationwide 5G in 2020.This quarter, Sievert made it clear the company plans to be more aggressive. He said, “we are busily building, we have our heads down creating the first TV service for the 5G era.” This would still seem to keep to the same 2020 timeline. However, he made the somewhat surprising comment that, “the TV service will also follow with a mobile TV service next year.” If T-Mobile can begin to monetize its Layer3 acquisition more quickly than anticipated, that’s good news for investors.I’ve made it no secret that I’m not a fan of the T-Mobile and Sprint merger. My primary issue is, T-Mobile by the numbers is the better performing company. It seems like a strong company feels compelled to buy its much weaker peer to prove a point. That being said, it’s likely that the “new T-Mobile” will be able to compete effectively against AT&T and Verizon.With that in mind, even without Sprint, T-Mobile has multiple ways to improve and keep investors happy. The company can continue to focus on growing its postpaid subscribers, to the benefit of service revenue and equipment revenue. T-Mobile seems to have a significant opportunity to save hundreds of millions in SG&A expenses. Investors know that 5G mobile and broadband are expected to bring one of the biggest transformations in the telecom industry.If T-Mobile can ramp up its Layer3 offerings as quickly as it is promising 5G (or quicker), this opens a whole new world of revenue to the company. Long-term investors looking for an opportunity to jump into the stock shouldn’t wait for the next pullback. T-Mobile has been climbing over the last six months and this run should continue."
4183612,104143,2018-06-24T23:32:33-04:00,Sprint and T-Mobile merger has a very high probability of approval.Sprint and T-Mobile are both currently undervalued and could appreciate by 30%.The New T-Mobile enterprise will be a long-term buy and hold.,"Source: Wikipages.comIn a recently published article, I tried to provide the rationale and foundation for approval of a Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) merger. The merger of these two companies into a single entity would represent a significant long-term portfolio addition in the telecom sector. In addition, both Sprint and T-Mobile are currently undervalued.On June 18th, 2018, Sprint and T-Mobile took the formal step of filing a written communication under Section 425 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. This communication outlines the transaction, the public interest rationale, and various arguments for the approval of the merger.There are 12 main arguments made in the 425 filing document, which are pertinent to the merger and its approval. I have listed those points with the underlying bullet points from each argument. If you are interested in reading more on a specific point, I have included the page numbers in the 425 filing pertinent to each bullet.Here are the key points of the deal:The FCC is reviewing whether the above transaction could result in public harms, which includes but is not limited to, traditional antitrust principles.There were some interesting points made and citations in the document.Source: Author (derived from Yahoo Finance.com)We know the percentage of ownership for all the major stakeholders in the New TMUS, and the current outstanding shares and percentages that SFTBY and DT currently own in S and TMUS, respectively. A projected share issuance can be calculated for the New TMUS entity to be approximately 1.287 billion shares.You can combine the numbers for Sprint and T-Mobile to get the positions and values for the other New TMUS fields in the chart above.They calculated the exchange rate for Sprint shares on an estimated price of $64.65 per share of T-Mobile.However, if we use the AT&T Price/BV multiple (1.35) multiplied by the current combined Book Value of Sprint and T-Mobile ($49.07 B), we get a true opening value for the new entity of $66.25/share.That would give us a current value for each Sprint share at $6.80/share.Now comes the interesting part. When forming the new entity they will have the opportunity to re-assess the assets of both Sprint and T-Mobile. Wall Street analysts have debated for years what the true value of Sprint's spectrum is worth. The arguments range from no premium of current value due to non-deployment, to triple the current value based on the comparative values of other carriers' spectrum.The current value assigned to Sprint's spectrum is $40 B. If the spectrum is re-valued it could alter the base pricing support per share drastically.These 12 main points addressed in the 425 filing to the FCC paint a solid picture for the FCC to approve the merger. The FCC appears to have the broader scope and purview in terms of public interest, anti-trust, and ad competitive fairness.However, the DOJ’s scope of antitrust will be narrower, but clearing the FCC approval process would likely render the DOJ approval to an almost conciliatory deference towards the merger.In fact, Makan Delrahim, who heads antitrust efforts for the U.S. Department of Justice, said he doesn't see reducing the number of major wireless carriers from four to three as inherently bad for the market, per Bloomberg reports.I see very few arguments countering the 425 points and premises, and almost none that can’t be refuted and overcome.I am looking for FCC and DOJ to approve this merger very soon, possibly as early as the end of August 2018.Current Sprint shares are undervalued anywhere from 15% to 20% and T-Mobile Shares are undervalued from 8% to 10%. The variance depends on which valuation method you choose, the original price of calculation for merger or the Book Value calculation.If New TMUS recalibrates the spectrum value, then you could see the current Sprint and T-Mobile share value climb by over 30%.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4203587,95916,2018-09-01T15:23:48-04:00,"Senators exercise influence over mergers, but only indirectly, and the final decision will be made by the DOJ and courts, which were not at the hearing.Assessing the pro-merger arguments and their prospects requires using the proper legal and economic standard that DOJ will apply.The merger advocates often cited other factors than consumer welfare to justify the deal, but that's the only relevant standard for DOJ review.Sprint's increasing progress in eliminating red ink also may pose an obstacle to the merger's future.","This week, Macquarie reported that there's growing sentiment that the merger between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) will be approved. That largely tracks with the prevailing winds here at Seeking Alpha as well. I wanted to give a quick counterpoint and explain to investors why I'm not sold yet this deal is going to go so smoothly over at DOJ.At the end of last month, the US Senate held a hearing into the pending merger. Contributor Mark Rewers analyzed the hearing and came away generally impressed with the strength of the merger’s case. I won’t rehash his whole article, but it's definitely a strong analysis and worth a read.However, I was of a rather different opinion of the outcome of the debate.Mr. Rewers laid out six points of contention that the hearing was meant to address, and argued that John Legere, Marcelo Claure, and their supporting witnesses did a good job of addressing all of them - certainly a better job than the opposing witnesses did. He sees the merger as therefore likely to go through, and Sprint short positions as potentially somewhat exposed as a result.I'm not opposed to monitoring US Senate sentiment about mergers, as I myself have done before. I agree they exercise influence over the approval of mergers. The influence is, however, indirect - through their power to confirm nominees and barter votes on other matters. The final decision about the merger will come from the DOJ.And frankly, the arguments put forward by the witnesses were not the best arguments one could make against the merger, or if they were they were very poorly presented. The relevant question is not whether the opposing witnesses answers were enough to rebut the merger arguments, but rather whether the best answers from those opposed to it will be, when the DOJ hears them in the coming weeks and months. With all respect to Mr. Rewers, I think it quite possible that they will be, and I would hesitate before reading too much about the merger’s prospects into the colloquies that took place at the hearing.Mark Rewers thought that six points were at issue, and that all six were addressed adequately by the merger advocates. I agree with some of this.The point about rural America is particularly well taken: Rural America suffers first and foremost from poor rates of return on the necessary investments for wireless service, owing to the low levels of population density. A merger will not do anything to make that problem worse, despite merger opponents’ claims.I don’t entirely agree with Mark that the prepaid issue was adequately addressed, but that will not be the focus of this article, as Stone Fox Capital already laid out a considered response.The third point made by advocates was that AT&T (T) trying to buy T-Mobile is different from T-Mobile trying to buy Sprint. No two deals are exactly alike, I suppose, but I disagree with this.Both deals result in a major wireless competitor being taken off the board. It's certainly true that the 2011 deal was going to leave a dominant AT&T, a strong Verizon (VZ) and a very weak Sprint as the third player. This deal will leave AT&T, Verizon and a New T-Mobile, all about equal size and power. So the 2011 deal produced two strong players and this deal produces three. Merger advocates set great stock by this point.But this argument only makes sense if you believe T-Mobile is not a strong carrier already. If it is, then we went from three strong carriers and one weak carrier to three strong carriers - still a step back for competition. And I’m still not clear on exactly what the basis for considering T-Mobile “weak” is. The company recently smoked competitors at a spectrum auction and acquired 30 MHz of 600 MHz spectrum that could soon give it Verizon-level quality. It's profitable and expanding, and continuing to strike deals with new companies like Netflix (NFLX) and Pandora (P) to boost its consumer offering.What’s more, the sleight of hand here is to try to subtly rephrase and alter the question that DOJ will be looking at. The argument essentially is that the deal being considered is not quite as anticompetitive as the last one. They’ve beaten out the old AT&T deal in competition remaining, so it should be approved because they’ve cleared that low bar and taken a small step. But that’s like walking a few blocks east and saying you’re on your way to Paris. Until you reach the destination, its just not much to boast about.To me, it seems they are still far from the designation, actually preserving the competitive pressure that the abrogation of the AT&T/T-Mobile deal unleashed. The proper comparison is between competition now and competition after the deal closes, not competition after this deal closes to what competition would have been if a different anti-competitive deal had been approved. Being a little better than the last anticompetitive deal proposed probably isn’t good enough for DOJ, and shouldn’t be.This leaves the other three points: Going from four to three carriers, the lack of financial necessity of a merger, and an end to pricing pressure. Since these points are all intertwined with one another - number of competitors affects pricing pressure and pricing pressure affects the financial viability of competitors - it makes sense to consider them together. The question is whether the counterpoints advanced sufficiently addressed them to satisfy the DOJ. I submit that perhaps they didn’t, and they shouldn’t.Competition policy begins with the fundamental belief that competition is a good thing, so going from four to three is never a positive of itself, it's always a negative. The real debate here is whether the fourth carrier is sufficiently viable to stand alone (otherwise we’re going to three carriers regardless), and if so, whether other aspects of the merger are sufficiently pro-consumer as to make that loss worthwhile.Whereupon we run into the merger’s next problem. As I said, I don’t quite consider T-Mobile a weak carrier now. But it's not entirely clear to me that DOJ will see Sprint as a weak carrier, either. In which case, the merger proposes going from four strong carriers to three, and is even more anticompetitive.The idea that Sprint must find a merger partner is somewhat challenged by the fact that Sprint is making money, albeit not much, without one. Marcelo Claure spent a lot of time emphasizing that Sprint has lost tens of billions over the past 10 years. But this too is sleight of hand, in a way, implying a standard that doesn’t exist. Competition policy doesn’t exist to help shareholders recoup past losses. Only consumer welfare is at issue, at least as far as DOJ is concerned. And those losses have nothing to do with whether the company is losing money now. It isn’t.In fact, Sprint’s TTM net income, exclusive of its tax cut benefits, is $450 million as of end of 2Q. Not much in terms of capital gains for shareholders, but subscriber growth has been sufficient to put it back into the black. Which raises the question for regulators: What exactly is wrong with the current arrangement?Undoubtedly this has been driven substantially by Sprint’s return to subscriber growth. But cost cutting also has helped Sprint. Sprint has closed underperforming stores and consolidated customer service units. Sprint also has begun thinning out its regional management layer and made various other personnel and cost cuts to return itself to a firm, if not auspicious, financial footing.While Sprint is not going to make Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBY) rich anytime soon, it's no longer bleeding cash. In other words, Sprint is not generating large profit, which is bad for its owners. But it's not actually losing money, so it's not clear why its situation is not sufficiently sustainable for consumer purposes.Altogether, I don’t see the testimony or the facts as demonstrating convincingly that Sprint’s position is unacceptable from a consumer perspective, even though I quite understand Sprint investors are not happy. But legally DOJ isn’t supposed to care about that. And they probably won’t.If Sprint is not doomed to fail standing alone, there must be consumer benefits to the merger sufficient to outweigh the obvious benefits that competition has brought to the wireless space. (The industry has essentially been in a constant state of price competition since AT&T’s bid to buy T-Mobile was shot down.) The argument was that New T-Mobile would continue to cut prices because it would have a lot of spare capacity to sell.This too, I'm sorry to say, is sleight of hand. This article is long enough already, so I will be brief here: Private companies, we all know, do not exist to maximize the utilization of their services. They exist to maximize profit, for which higher utilization is usually, but not always, a path forward. The implication that extra capacity always makes for lower prices was neither probed closer nor expounded upon with evidence by the CEOs.What’s more, there's already evidence that in wireless, spare capacity does not produce large price cuts. This evidence lies in the fact that the industry has always had large amounts of spare capacity. Less than 7% of cell towers are ever at peak usage, and even for less than 10% of the time. But prior to the abrogation of the T-Mobile/AT&T merger, this had never produced a sustained price drop. I have written before about the large number of capacity utilization limitations Verizon and AT&T used to use, which had little engineering justification but allowed prices to be kept artificially high.We have yet to hear why this will be different this time, and I suspect DOJ will want to know. Merely demonstrating the existence of spare capacity does not satisfy the legal inquiry into whether or not that capacity tends to produce a price drop in the specific industry.Neither side, frankly, impressed me. The anti-merger witnesses failed to make their case effectively and missed several key points in their favor. But the pro-merger witnesses seemed at times to almost be playing sleight of hand with the debate. The issue was the consumer benefits of the merger vs. more competition. And that was a question Legere and Claure kept trying to redirect or modify. While many of the questions were about competition, few of the answers were.That appears to have thrown the witnesses off a bit, and perhaps even satisfied the senators. Since it is not the standard the law calls for evaluating the merger under, though I doubt it will satisfy DOJ, at least not as is.To be clear, I'm in no way saying I expect the merger to be blocked. My point is simply that there are ample issues to be raised and the poor performance of the witnesses in front of the Senate may not be the best guide to how persuasive those arguments might be in the privacy of DOJ meetings, where they will presumably be presented better. My recommendation to investors would simply be to maintain your opinion of the merger’s prospects, whatever it was, before the hearing happened.As for the companies themselves, I continue to see T-Mobile and Verizon as strong wireless players regardless of the merger's prospects, although obviously if the deal went through and they could all raise prices stocks would rise even more. Sprint is probably selling low on its valuable spectrum hoard, so I would be more bullish on its stock if the deal was called off. But the market takes the contrary view, so there would be time to buy in after that happened, if it happened. I don't see a reason to hold Sprint stock now, except perhaps as a proxy for T-Mobile stock.I continue to believe AT&T is the most pressured of the four, and would avoid the stock."
4208489,22148,2018-09-26T21:29:29-04:00,"T-Mobile outlined plans to the FCC for broadband market expansion, further highlighting regulator approval risks.The combined valuation comparison to Verizon would make the stock appealing on a deal approval.The stock is on the verge of a breakout above previous strong resistance around $66.A merger approval still appears based on false hope.","Last week, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) further unveiled aggressive ambitions to enter the internet broadband race following the merger with Sprint (NYSE:S). The move is another glimpse into the power of the combination of wireless providers that would reward shareholders and also another warning to regulators of allowing the combination. The stock is on a verge of a breakout around $69 on what appears more false hope of a merger close.The ultimate question for the merger approval is whether the wireless market and hence the 5G market is more or less competitive with the merger. The new T-Mobile is making the claim that the combined network will offer the solutions wanted and needed by consumers, but the company hasn't made the case on whether the market wouldn't be better off if both T-Mobile and Sprint partnered with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Dish Networks (NASDAQ:DISH) or a tech giant.The company makes a clear case to the FCC that the 5G user experience will be greatly enhanced by a network combination. Both a 2021 example and the below 2024 figure shows that over 90% of users along the spectrum of POPs covered will see faster speeds via merging the networks.Source: T-Mobile FCC documentWhat the document doesn't do is address whether this is the best solution to make a competitive 5G wireless market in 2021 or 2024. The biggest fears of the government aren't resolved with this document, as the fears remain that 3 strong competitors will reduce network innovation down the road.The market clearly likes the solutions the company is offering via the merger. T-Mobile is attempting to break above strong resistance below $70 that has lasted well over a year now. One can't really argue with the stock being very valuable if a combination can eliminate the pricing pressures in the sector and ultimately develop the best 5G network.The enterprise value for Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) remains far in excess of the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint at about $130 billion now. One can view the gap closing after a merger closure.TMUS Enterprise Value data by YChartsT-Mobile apparently has ambitions similar to other wireless providers like Verizon to provide both a 5G fixed wireless solution as a broadband substitute and the ability to even use the mobile connection via a smartphone as an internet connection for home users.The ironic part here is that T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray spent this blog post trashing 5G fixed as not a real 5G offering. T-Mobile now presents to the FCC that the company plans to become a top 4 internet broadband provider.This quote from the CTO won't play too well:The biggest issue is that in a matter of months, T-Mobile is now claiming that the company will allow customers to make self-installations without providing any details on how it has solved the problem that Verizon can't. Even more, why would the DOJ want all this power in the hands of one provider?According to a summary from FierceWireless, COO Mike Sievert outlined to the FCC the following customer targets for both 5G fixed broadband and mobile broadband customers:5G Fixed broadband5G Mobile broadbandWith the ability of the wireless giants to now move into the broadband market, having even more providers appears necessary. T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T could theoretically control all internet connections for the US market in the distant future.The only issue is that the ambitions and goals of T-Mobile appear contrary to where market demand will exist in 3-6 years. The goal of 100 Mbps download speeds in 2021 doesn't appear all that competitive when my local market already has offers from Cox for up to 1 Gbps.So, if anything, T-Mobile is bringing up more reasons for regulatory review, while possibly not even having a real competitive solution.The key investor takeaway is that my view remains negative on the merger approval. T-Mobile continues to make a strong case for why shareholders should want this deal, while the valuation appears attractive in relation to another near-wireless pure play in Verizon. The problem is that the company continues to make the case for regulators to block the deal.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

The traditional rhetoric about more choice, greater competition, and better quality, is being used again to try and justify a misguided merger. Though both companies broke off merger talks less than a year ago, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE: S) are trying to convince regulators, customers and shareholders that their combination makes sense. While this could be good news for consumers, it’s hard to find a reason to like this deal for stockholders.When a merger is announced, one of the first things the companies are quick to point out is the benefits to the bottom line. John Legere, CEO of the New T-Mobile says of the merger that, “This combination will create a fierce competitor able to deliver lower prices, more innovation, and a second-to-none network experience.”It’s not on accident that his statement doesn’t talk about how much more growth the company will have. The numbers don’t lie, and T-Mobile shareholders should be worried. The Un-Carrier has been arguably the best performer of the big wireless carriers. In the last five years, T-Mobile shareholders have enjoyed a compound annual growth rate in their investment of just under 20%. It’s difficult to suggest this performance will continue, look at what a drag Sprint would have been on T-Mobile in the current quarter.(Source: T-Mobile and Sprint recent quarterly reports)I know it’s simple to believe that combining the companies will allow cost synergies to help improve the above numbers, but why mess with a good thing? If you are a Sprint shareholder, this is no golden parachute either. For part of last year, while merger talks with T-Mobile were going on, the shares did well. However, as it became clear the deal might not go through, the shares tumbled. Investors who bought Sprint shares on speculation of last year’s merger are still likely underwater. At current prices, Sprint shareholders would get about $6.10 in value for their shares. This is little consolation as the shares traded above this figure for most of 2017.It’s no secret that Sprint has debt. There is a reason that Softbank stepped in to acquire a controlling stake in the company. If the combined companies are going to aggressive roll out a 5G network, the natural question is how do they finance this project?If the decreased growth mentioned above should concern T-Mobile customers, the combined company’s debt load should have them up at night. T-Mobile’s long-term debt net of cash is $24 billion or about 34% of total assets. Though the deal for Sprint is all stock, the combined company will have to service both T-Mobile and Sprint’s debt. Given that Sprint is sitting on long-term debt net of cash of another $28.5 billion, the new T-Mobile will theoretically start its life with a mountain of debt to the tune of about 42% of total assets.If the amount of debt doesn’t worry investors, the interest payments should. Looking at the last three months, the new T-Mobile’s combined interest payments per quarter would work out to just under $1 billion. Given the new company’s combined operating income would have been about $1.5 billion, this means interest payments alone would extinguish 66% of operating income. Just to put this in perspective, that is more than double the percentage that T-Mobile deals with today.One of the primary justifications for this merger is that, “Only the New T-Mobile will be uniquely able to…quickly deploy a broad and deep nationwide 5G network.” That seems like an ironic statement, comparing T-Mobile’s, “combined spectrum to AT&T which has 34% more and Verizon which has 172% more.”According to Verizon’s CEO Lowell McAdam, the company believes it has a lead in 5G development. He said, (from a 5G perspective) “we’re going to do it regardless, and we’re way ahead of everybody.” It’s interesting to note that a much smaller player in wireless, Comcast licenses its service through Verizon. Any improvements in the Verizon system, spill over to Comcast mobile customers as well.What’s interesting here is, T-Mobile would likely get much farther with its ambitions in an nontraditional tie up with Comcast. The cable giant already owns the pipes that deliver content. The company isn’t afraid of big mergers (it acquired NBCUniversal) and recently made a bid for 21st Century Fox.Where Sprint offers spectrum, Comcast offers the deep pockets that would allow T-Mobile to go head-to-head with the likes of Verizon and AT&T. Just to put this in perspective, last quarter the new T-Mobile would have generated negative core free cash flow due primarily to Sprint’s significant lease obligations. By comparison T-Mobile without this merger generated about $1.5 billion free cash flow in the last three months. Comcast on the other hand, generated roughly $5.8 billion in this same time-frame. With Verizon clocking in with core free cash flow of about $9 billion, and the new AT&T coming in at about $6 billion, we can see how strong a T-Mobile / Comcast marriage would be.In addition, Comcast and T-Mobile would allow Comcast to offer its own wireless service instead of being tied to Verizon. If customers are looking for coverage, the idea of adding Comcast’s 18 million WiFi hotspots must be a serious consideration.In a not insignificant side note in T-Mobile’s recent earnings, I dug out this little nugget.The company was discussing its share repurchases and explained if it doesn’t go through with the Sprint merger, there is another $7.5 billion in stock repurchases on the table. T-Mobile would repurchase $500 million in 2018, $3 billion in 2019, and $4 billion in 2020.The stark reality facing T-Mobile investors is if this merger goes through their great growth story may be coming to a screeching halt. A slowing growing company with a mountain of debt doesn’t sound like the strong competitor that can challenge Verizon and AT&T. It’s time for T-Mobile to accept going it alone, or to find a different partner."
4191391,104143,2018-07-27T16:03:59-04:00,Sprint short positions are speculating and hedging on a denial of the merger.Dr. Roslyn Layton’s responses drove the main pro-merger points home.Marcelo Claure answers definitively on the differences between the merger attempt in 2011 between AT&T/T-Mobile and the current merger proposal.John Legere stunned Senator Klobuchar with his answer on pre-paid service concerns and the motivation for it.Was the Senate Subcommittee really disinterested?,"Source: Wikimedia.orgThe continuing saga of the Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) merger took another step forward on June 27, 2018, with a hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights.The outcome of the hearing was that the arguments against the merger were all rebutted, and the case against merger approval took a serious blow in credibility. The answers and revelations made put Sprint and T-Mobile long shareholders in an ever better position and jeopardizes those who are short on Sprint in the hopes of a merger failure.There were 6 key elements to the hearing, and the responses to those positions were ultimately all indicating that a pro-merger ruling was necessary.There was also 1 key indicator which revealed that there was very little Senate interest in the merger proceedings.Below, I will outline the key facets and the pro and con statements made for both positions on the key elements.There were six witnesses present, both for and against the merger, who presented testimony to the subcommittee.Disclaimer: Please be advised that some of the following quotations may have been edited for length, content, spelling and other pressures of publishing. However, most statements were written just as they were expressed by the committee and witnesses in attendance.Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) spearheaded the hearing for the Senate subcommittee. Regardless of political affiliation, both Senators had tough, reasonable and fair-minded questions.As a sidebar, Senator Klobuchar revealed that she was a lawyer for MCI early in her career and showed a great depth of knowledge in the telecom sector.The witnesses' answers were equally profound and revealed surprise answers.John Legere and Marcelo Claure, from T-Mobile and Sprint, respectively, did what they needed to do and gave sound reasoning and rationale for the merger. However, the real star of the hearing was Dr. Roslyn Layton as her answers punched numerous holes in the main arguments of those opposed to the merger and gave solid support for the merger.The following will detail the subcommittee's concerns and points, including the witnesses' responses and a brief summarizing opinion.The crux of the argument is that Sprint and T-Mobile do not need to merge to stay viable and prosper. Rather than merger would only fast-track their success at the expense of consumers.Here are the excerpts from the opening statements on this argument:Mr. John Legere - CEO, T-MobileMr. Marcelo Claure - Executive Chairman, SprintMs. Asha Keddy - VP - Technology, IntelMr. Gene Kimmelman - President/CEO, Public Knowledge and Chief Counsel to US Department of Justice Anti-Trust DivisionAuthor Note: This is misleading, as MCI merged with WorldCom in 1997 and ironically, Sprint tried to buy MCI/WorldCom in 1999. WorldCom went into bankruptcy when the DOJ blocked the merger and the Securities and Exchange Commission took control of the entity.After dissolving the original company, WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy as a new company and changed back to the MCI name.Qwest and Verizon both bid to acquire MCI which ended the era of independent long distance telephone companies.Dr. Roslyn Layton - Visiting Scholar, American Enterprise InstituteMr. George Slover - Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers UnionSummary of Argument: The argument was made by Senator Klobuchar and supported by Gene Kimmelman and George Slover that Sprint and TMUS had no real need to merge other than faster financial gain.That argument was handled from the beginning as John Legere and Marcelo Claure made the above points in their opening statements with supporting points from Asha Keddy and Dr. Roslyn Layton. The rebutting points proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Sprint and T-Mobile would thrive together but apart would not be able to compete in a realistic fashion against AT&T and Verizon.The opposition viewpoint was bolstered by George Slover and Gene Kimmelman, and in the end, Mr. Kimmelman conceded many points and offered little more than opinion and feelings with no support for the position.The senate hearing, along with the previously submitted Public Interest Statement to the FCC, makes this argument false.One of the main arguments against the merger is the merger will lead to an increase in pricing from the remaining carriers. This was echoed in opening statements and several questions and responses.From the opening statements, key points made were:Mr. Marcelo Claure - Executive Chairman, SprintMr. Gene Kimmelman - President/CEO, Public Knowledge and Chief Counsel to US Department of Justice Anti-Trust DivisionDr. Roslyn Layton - Visiting Scholar, American Enterprise InstituteHere were the key questions and responses for this point:Senator Klobuchar:Legere Response:Claure Response:Senator Klobuchar:Layton Response:Summary of the Arguments: The pro-merger witnesses dismantled the argument of higher prices. Mr. Claure pointed out that data capacity would increase by six times, and both Mr. Legere and Mr. Claure stated that pricing would have to be lowered to attract new customers to fill that excess capacity.Mr. Legere answered Senator Klobuchar that New TMUS would honor all Sprint pricing plans.Mr. Claure stated that if Sprint has to do 5G alone, it will have to INCREASE pricing.Dr. Layton pointed out and submitted evidence that consolidation has been ongoing from multiple carriers down to a few carriers for over a decade and prices have fallen along with the number of carriers.The only rebuttal from Mr. Kimmelman on Dr. Layton's statement was that the rate of pricing decline was greater when we had 8 or more carriers than we would have going from 4 to 3 carriers. However, that is also called the law of diminishing returns in economics 101.This has been one of the primary arguments against the merger. In an earlier article, I laid out why this argument has little factual basis as the majority of countries have three major carriers, and pricing is based more closely on GDP of a country rather than number of carriers.Here are the relative excerpts from the opening statements on this argument:Mr. Gene Kimmelman - President/CEO, Public Knowledge and Chief Counsel to US Department of Justice Anti-Trust DivisionDr. Roslyn Layton - Visiting Scholar, American Enterprise InstituteMr. George Slover - Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers UnionHere were the key questions and responses for this point:Senator Lee:Layton Response:Summary of Arguments: The witnesses solidly rebuked the main argument against the merger.First, Mr. Slover and Mr. Kimmelman cited several times that the 4 carrier model is better than three carrier model. Although they espoused their feelings and opinions forcefully, they had no concrete facts or evidence to support their positions.However, Mr. Legere and Mr. Claure did an admirable job of laying out the benefits of a strong 3 versus the current model of a strong 2 carriers and 2 weak carriers.Dr. Layton did the most damage to debunk this notion with a supported argument from Austria and a real life example of Denmark trying to go from 4 to 3 failing in the attempt and incurring higher costs.Mr. Kimmelman agreed that the empirical data was more important than the number of carriers, and that he didn't reject Dr. Layton's positions.This was a relatively new argument that surfaced just a few weeks before the hearing. It is championed by Peter Adderton the former founder of Boost Mobile. Sprint acquired Boost when it Bought Nextel in 2006. Nextel had previously taken control of Boost in the USA in 2003.Mr. Adderton argues that the merger will leave the new company with control of over 50% of the pre-paid market, and they will raise prices due to dominance.This is one of the weaker arguments against the merger.The following are the excerpts from the opening statements on this argument:Mr. George Slover - Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers UnionHere was the key question and response for this point:Senator Klobuchar:Legere Response:This revelation slightly stunned Senator Klobuchar, and she said she was unaware of this but would look into it.Summary of Argument: Senator Klobuchar asked for comments regarding the pre-paid market that has been making headlines recently (this is in reference to the Peter Adderton position which has been picked up by many reporters). Mr. Claure made an adequate argument about the differences between post-paid and pre-paid, but the real turning point came when Mr. Legere pointed out that the whole argument was being promoted for self-serving interests by outside individuals. This statement caught Sen Klobuchar off guard for a moment before she humbly said she would have to investigate that.This was one of the original premises that many thought would signal denial of the deal. AT&T attempted to buy T-Mobile in 2011 and had the deal rejected by the FCC and the DOJ. Some pundits say this current deal is identical to the 2011 deal and should be denied on precedent alone.Here are the excerpts from the opening statements on this argument:Mr. Gene Kimmelman - President/CEO, Public Knowledge and Chief Counsel to US Department of Justice Anti-Trust DivisionDr. Roslyn Layton - Visiting Scholar, American Enterprise InstituteHere were the key questions and responses for this point:Senator Klobuchar:Claure Response:Senator Lee:Claure Response:Summary of Argument: Both Senators Klobuchar and Lee referenced previous merger attempts in 2011 by T-Mobile and AT&T, and 2014 when Sprint initially tried to merge with TMUS. The 2011 deal was a completely different dynamic from the current deal as Mr. Claure stated in rebuttal to that argument as outlined above.The 2014 attempt was perhaps premature as SoftBank (SFTBF) had just taken over Sprint at the end of 2013. The rebuttal to this argument was forcefully put with excellent data to back it up.This is probably the weakest argument against the merger, as it is irrelevant to it. This is a function of economics and business ROI. All 4 carriers are underserving rural America at this time. That will not change if the status quo is kept in place.Here was the key question and response for this point:Senator Klobuchar:Legere Response:Summary of Argument: Although this appears to be a valid point on the surface. No one has found the correct formula for getting service out to sparsely populated areas yet. The merger allowing the entities to invest more in the combined network, could only make rural service better, as it would certainly not make it any worse. If anything this is a potential bargaining chip, rather than argument for or against the merger.There were several comments made that the 5G or the next generation of wireless and mobile wasn't as important as the pricing to consumers or the competition among carriers.This couldn't be farther from reality!Here are the excerpts from the opening statements on this argument:Mr. Gene Kimmelman - President/CEO, Public Knowledge and Chief Counsel to US Department of Justice Anti-Trust DivisionMr. George Slover - Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers UnionSummary of Arguments: The reality is the building and utilization of the next generation of mobile architecture (5G) is paramount to our ongoing economic and military dominance.The key vision of the new architecture is the reduction of latency (delay) in transmissions from the current ~25ms to 1ms. Currently, there is only one known network in the world that has a latency of 1ms, and that is the human nervous system.What this architecture will foster is the dawn of the ""tactile internet"" where we don't only see and hear the data we feel it and respond to it almost immediately.The innovations and applications from the tactile internet are enormous in both scope and relevance.Consider F-35 fighter planes that can be controlled by a pilot in a simulator, or tanks operating the same way. Long haul trucking that is continuous 24-7 with no delays for driver fatigue. Interactive Virtual reality, fused robotic exoskeletons, distance learning where the teacher, surgeon or engineer can feel the actual movements and make corrections as necessary. These examples are just the tip of the iceberg.The European 5GPPP is already ahead of the USA as they have just announced a 3 phase array of projects that will allow the European Commission to launch a pan-European architecture.Simultaneously, China has unveiled a radio spectrum map and licenses which will allow for 5G adoption and devices in 2019. China has already deployed 5G technologies and architecture in 5 cities while the USA has zero to date.The acceleration of the next generation architecture is the primary concern going forward and the witnesses for the government got it wrong.As a final signal, this hearing was highlighted, promoted, and anticipated for many weeks.What comes as an eye-opening turn of events is that there are 9 senators on the subcommittee; however, for a hearing that lasted 2 hours and 15 minutes, only the Chairman (Senator Lee), the Ranking Member (Senator Klobuchar) and 2 out of the 7 remaining committee members showed up for the meeting.The two additional members in attendance were Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) who was present from 0:05 to 0:50 and asked no questions nor made any comments, and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut).Senator Blumenthal came in at 0:50 asked one series of questions regarding jobs and how many jobs would be affected in Connecticut. Senator Blumenthal left the meeting at the 1:42 mark.Although it is common for senators to miss meetings, how much resistance and concern to the merger is there when less than half the Senate Subcommittee showed up for a hearing?As each step of the merger process and presentation is completed, all outcomes and indicators continually point to a lack of credible arguments that the DOJ or FCC can mount to derail this merger. In politics, anything can ultimately happen. I still remain convinced that this merger has an 85-90% certainty of going forward.With that being the case, there remains the issue of almost 25% of the shares floated being in a short sale position. Over 25% of the short shares were shorted at or below the initial merger valuation for Sprint shares at the end of April, which was $6.62.This puts short shares in a tenuous position going forward. I do not believe time is on their side, nor are the odds of disapproval of the merger."
4195745,22148,2018-08-07T11:40:12-04:00,The merger between Sprint and T-Mobile will face a heated debate to obtain regulatory approval.The biggest risk remains the 30 million prepaid customers that rely on the competitive pricing of these competitors.The merger focuses on substantial margin expansion that will draw regulatory scrutiny.,"Some signs are emerging that US regulators might favor a three-carrier market that would support a merger between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS). The risk to owning Sprint though is magnified by the recent announcement of a new CFO bringing about the odd situation of a new executive team in place while the company is in the middle of difficult merger proceedings. The potential of the merger getting blocked raises the risks to the stock with new leaders. Image Source: Sprint websiteAlong with the proposed merger, Sprint made the odd announcement to promote CEO Marcelo Claure to the COO position within parent SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY). The move is logical after the merger closes considering T-Mobile's John Legere will head the new wireless giant, but the move was very premature considering the risk to closing the deal. Also, Andrew Davies took over the CFO role on July 2. Mr. Davies appears reasonably qualified with previous experience at Vodafone Group (VOD) and the CFO of Verizon (VZ) Wireless. He reports to new CEO Michel Combes that took over that role in May. Mr. Combes was only hired at the start of the year as the CFO following a short stint at Altice (ATUS). He was forced to resign last November. In essence, Sprint has hired several industry players that had previously found themselves unemployed in the sector. Not an issue if the merger gets government approval, but a big problem if the deal is blocked. While T-Mobile and Sprint have promoted a combination that can compete in 5G with the wireless giants of AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ), the biggest risk to the merger is likely low-end consumers. Both wireless companies have built a business on prepaid-subscribers that could conceivably be the biggest group harmed in a combination where the new T-Mobile doesn't aggressively compete on price anymore. The New York Post report conflicts with the previous news that the New York Attorney General's office reportedly began investigating the merger's impact on consumers opting for the cheapest plans. The combined company has 30 million prepaid customers and the debate will center around whether the market is better off with three strong competitors in 5G or a more price competitive situation with four carriers.My investment thesis all along is that Sprint points out the wrong data points. This slide from the FQ4'17 earnings presentation points out the clear problem. The wireless laggard pointed out themselves how the improvement from all of the discounts in the last few years was in the prepaid sector. The company hardly saw any improvements in the last three years in postpaid phone net adds while prepaid net adds saw an incredible 1.4 million improvement. Source: Sprint FQ4'17 presentation Sprint had the following connections at the end of June:T-Mobile had the following connections at the end of June:Combined customer counts:One will take an interesting point from how Sprint spent time on the presentation discussing the postpaid phone average billings as a crucial point in revenues stabilizing. No mention of the prepaid average billings per user showing how the group is an after thought of the company and likely the merger. The company itself has highly promoted the concept of building a superior 5G network. While all subscribers in theory would benefit from a third competitive network, the companies aren't likely to ramp up network spending in order to serve the less lucrative prepaid market. The new combined entity provided this slide on the network spending and the forecast on margin expansion. T-Mobile might propose the deal will cut prices for consumers, but the only clear sign here is a focus on higher margins. Source: T-Mobile/Sprint merger presentation The pro-forma capital expenditures are targeted at $10 to $11 billion this year with the company forecasting $40 billion over three years. The amount only averages about $13.3 billion with a target of keeping the expenditures virtually flat as revenues go from $75 billion toward $100 billion long term. Again, nothing in the data supports the merger is going to help out the prepaid customers. The key investor takeaway is that the New York Post is probably right that the merger odds are about 50/50 now. The risk to the stock remains to the downside on the merger being blocked due to the new management team and the weak financials.The 0.10256 exchange ratio values Sprint at somewhere below $7 depending on updated prices of T-Mobile. The stock is interesting around the 52-week lows of $5, but one should be careful in chasing merger hype due to the downside risk. If the merger gets blocked, the stock could hit new lows.

4179434,104143,2018-06-05T09:14:06-04:00,"Sprint and T-Mobile need the merger for very different reasons.Verizon and AT&T already provided the foundational arguments for Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) approval.Federal government wants three things: 5G, competition and jobs.The “Street” doesn’t think it will happen, but what did they overlook?Verizon and AT&T come out on the short end of the stick with merger approval.","Source: China FilmInsiderThe recent announcement and confirmation of a merger agreement between Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has been met with skepticism, if not outright disdain, by analysts and pundits from Wall Street. However, to avoid a two-carrier-dominated landscape, the only logical path is to approve the merger.The merger is set up for approval at both the FCC and the DOJ with a high probability, which was also bolstered directly by evidence and positions maintained by AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in filings to the FCC.A two-carrier market, which the FCC has already acknowledged is a real possibility, has been introduced, supported, and inadvertently verified by Verizon and AT&T.The rationale for competitive imbalance was made by former FCC Commissioner Wheeler in 2014. The hypothesis was further proven by both Verizon and AT&T in their defense and advocacy for continued roaming fees being paid to them by Sprint and T-Mobile. These arguments and rebuttals were adjudicated favorably in terms of minor relief for T-Mobile and Sprint dating back to 2014. If the FCC's, AT&T's, and Verizon's logic and arguments are valid and true from 2014 forward, then there is no other recourse but to approve the merger to prevent a two-carrier dominant system.Sprint and T-Mobile need the merger as they each have one half of the puzzle necessary to effectively compete with Verizon and AT&T.The merger would be a big blow to the revenue and competitive effect of Verizon and AT&T.The ""Street's"" theoretical rationale against the merger is three-fold at this point:Two past events drive the rationales that the merger has a less than 50% viability of getting past the three outlined roadblocks and receiving approval.The first event in 2011, saw the DOJ scuttle the merger of AT&T and T-Mobile on the grounds of anti-trust violations.Second, former FCC Chairman Wheeler and others in the Obama administration, cited their skepticism for a Sprint and T-Mobile contemplated merger in February 2014. Their rationale was that dropping to three national carriers would not be in the public's best interest in terms of savings passed on to the public.There are a few interesting and overlooked points that already exist:To help understand some details to follow, I will provide a few very simplistic points regarding radio frequencies.Neither Sprint nor T-Mobile has the appropriate combination of frequencies (or bandwidth for those frequencies) to provide a nationwide 5G mobility solution in a workable and cost effective manner. They each have one half of the puzzle.Sprint has the right frequencies and bandwidth to deploy 5G technology, however they lack the lower frequencies and bandwidth to adequately cover the rural areas.T-Mobile has the lower radio frequencies, but they lack the higher frequencies to deploy and utilize the 5G technologies.Here are the actual scenarios and problems each faces:Sprint: Sprint has approximately 14 MHz of bandwidth in the 800 MHz frequencies and another 10 MHz of bandwidth in the 1900 MHz frequency. Since 2004, they have been re-purposing their existing 800 frequencies for Public Safety (Mandated by FCC) in exchange for alternate 800 frequencies and some additional 1900 frequency bands.Today, after almost 12 years of transitioning (it was slated for a 36 month time frame in 2006), that process is down to the last 5 states. This has slowed Sprint from re-using the 800 and 1900 frequencies for LTE, and causing Sprint to invest almost $3 Billion for the mandated transition to take place.This frequency re-use is also partially responsible for Sprint staying with 2G and 3G without transitioning to VoLTE. Transition to VoLTE can only be realistically achieved once the whole network has predominantly achieved LTE status.The piece of the puzzle that Sprint owns is its 140 MHz of bandwidth at the 2500 MHz frequency. A continued rollout of that 2.5 GHz spectrum will allow Sprint to accelerate the evolution towards 5G ahead of all the other competitors.However, Sprint will have a huge hole in nationwide coverage, as the 800 MHz falls short of maximum efficiency (less than 20 MHz of bandwidth) for LTE and coverage. This has caused Sprint to have a heavy reliance on Verizon for roaming connectivity.T-Mobile: T-Mobile still lacks the spectrum to achieve 5G mobility throughput or latency goals. Recent comments from T-Mobile have stated 1T-Mobile will only achieve a 4.1G or 4.2G with a speed 3 to 4 times their current average of 30Mbps with their current spectrum holdings.Like Sprint, they have been tethered to AT&T for roaming connectivity outside their current areas of coverage.T-Mobile acquired 30 MHz of bandwidth of former TV spectrum in the 600 MHz range. They now have a pathway and ability to provide nationwide coverage at low 4G levels. However, deploying this spectrum is contingent on the reallocation and re-tuning of existing TV stations nationwide in the same fashion that Sprint's 800 MHz Public Safety transition required. This could take far longer than the 39 months the FCC has mandated unless T-Mobile contributes a significant subsidy similar to what Sprint did.First, the merger creates a formidable competitor rather than two separate smaller players, both with debt problems, (Sprint has $37B in debt and T-Mobile has $30 B in debt).Second, after the merger, the ""new"" T-Mobile would have more total spectrum than AT&T and Verizon combined. The spectrum from both companies could be combined and provide both puzzle pieces - nationwide coverage along with capacity/data rate/latency for the 5G evolution.And last, the merger eliminates a revenue source for AT&T and Verizon in the form of roaming fees.Although none of the carriers break out the roaming fee charges or costs in their revenues or cost of service expenses as separate line items, we can do a rough calculation.Exhibit 1 shows the amount of roaming data usage from 2008 to 2014 and the cost that T-Mobile was charged per MB. In 2014, this amounted to a cost for roaming of approximately $116 Billion for T-Mobile alone.The Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for global data traffic in North America was 50% from 2013 to 2018 per Statista.If we project that the rates AT&T and Verizon charged were reduced by 67% from the 2014 rate, for just $.06/MB, that would still give T-Mobile a cost approaching $200 Million for roaming fees in 2018 (assuming a straight linear expansion of consumed data). We can assume that Sprint is not getting a better deal or reduced rates.If we compare this roaming rate of $.18/ MB to a retail account from AT&T of $50.00/5 GB of data, AT&T receives $.01/MB from a consumer and charges T-Mobile/Sprint $0.18/MB. No wonder they don't want to see that go away! This represents a lucrative revenue source for AT&T and Verizon, and they will do everything they can to keep it going even if the rate per MB continued the downward trend in pricing.Argument 1 Against The Merger - Many are postulating the merger will be bad for consumers and cellular prices will rise for poorer groups and locales.This narrative has no factual foundation and amounts to an unsubstantiated fear and baseless rhetoric.According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) survey, of the 195 countries in the world 130 of them have three carriers or fewer.In the charts below (Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3 respectively), are the rankings of the 10 least expensive countries for cellular service, and the 9 most expensive countries for cellular service.The charts show that there is no correlation between the quantity of carriers and the average cost of service in a geographic area. Several of the cheapest countries have four carriers or fewer while the most expensive countries average four carriers with Ireland and Israel having five.What the charts show, is a correlation between GDP and cellular service prices. The most expensive countries all rank within the top 30 of the world's most productive countries, while the least expensive countries are among the poorer and least productive countries in the world.Last, some have tried to compare the United States market to the Canadian market as an indicator of what happens with three major carriers. Although the area of Canada and the US is identical (~3.8 M sq. mi.) Canada has only 10% of the population of the US. There are 32 million people in Canada versus 326 M in the US. And to further put that in perspective, in terms of scale, the entire cellular customer base of Canada represents less than 60% of just Sprint's customer base. Sprint and T-Mobile would not survive without raising prices, if their bases were cut by 40%.Exhibit 2Source: AuthorExhibit 3Source: Author* Insufficient penetration to register in resultsArgument 2 Against The Merger - Some pundits have cited that having only three national carriers is bad for competition. However, the FCC already knows the playing field is not level and a competitive imbalance is already in existence.To those ends, here is what the FCC already knows and what has been established:In addition, the spectrum held by AT&T and Verizon is 10X10 and the Sprint/T-Mobile licenses are primarily 5x5 in bandwidth. This makes them second tier licenses in terms of LTE bandwidth.Argument 3 Against The Merger - The last argument against the merger is that the deal will not pass the scrutiny of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). This claim is refutable and invalid as the total foreign ownership in the ""New"" T-Mobile will be diluted from the current combined individual foreign ownership in both Sprint and T-Mobile.Here is an illustrative chart showing the breakdown:Exhibit 4Source: AuthorBoth Sprint and T-Mobile filed complaints in 2014 against Verizon and AT&T claiming the roaming fees they were being charged were not based on fair and reasonable commercial rates and they should be monitored and reduced by the FCC. This was supported by four separate public and consumer interest groups in a separate filing to the FCC.Because Verizon and AT&T are the dominant carriers regarding roaming fees, some argued that Verizon and AT&T were actually setting up ""monopoly rent"" schemes, forcing smaller carriers to increase rates, and keeping their own rates inflated because they didn't have that expense.Naturally, Verizon and AT&T took exception to this.Verizon cited and included a research analysis paper from New Research to support its position to keep roaming charges as they were. Although Verizon did not use the financial analysis of Sprint from the report, the relevance of the financial analysis submission to the FCC is germane to providing a comparative analysis, showing the tremendous progress and effort Sprint made in a three-year period.The main arguments Verizon made in defense of the roaming charges were:T-Mobile had the same battle being waged with AT&T through a similar filed complaint.AT&T put forth the following arguments:The result of this was a declaratory statement from the FCC in December 2014, which sided with T-Mobile and also Sprint. The key findings were:The foundational argument and supporting thesis for the existing landscape, challenges facing Sprint and T-Mobile, and the future prospects for both has already been introduced, reviewed and adjudicated on by the FCC over the last four years.The governments intended nationwide mobility goals, from multiple points of comment, are as follows:Here are the hurdles to achieving those three goals:Taking all the above facts into consideration and through their rationale for not changing the roaming fee structure, AT&T and Verizon have inadvertently provided all the ammunition, logic, and substance to convey, that:The combination of those points makes it a reasonable conclusion that the only viable or logical path for the US Government to achieve their three highest goals outlined earlier is to approve the merger.The merger will provide three strong competitors going forward. There is no fact-driven argument to support three carriers being better or worse than four carriers. In addition, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim of reduced competition, increased prices or lack of savings passed on to consumers.Inadvertently, AT&T and Verizon provided the bulk of the argument to justify the merger.In my portfolio, Sprint is still a long-term acquisition and a value at its current price. TMUS is also a good position at these levels if you don't already hold Sprint shares, but as I will already get TMUS at the merger, it makes little sense to buy them now for my portfolio. Although Verizon and AT&T come out on the short side of the stick with the merger approval, I feel both are still excellent choices on their price and business model going forward. However, AT&T and Verizon accumulation rationales are a different article altogether.The main question is can John Legere and Marcelo Claure lay out the argument for the merger in simple and compelling terms and not convolute and confuse what the FCC and DOJ already knows it should do."
4178646,95916,2018-05-31T18:02:51-04:00,"T-Mobile returned to the music space, offering first free TuneIn and then going back to free Pandora.TuneIn seems to have flopped in its alternative approach to audio streaming.T-Mobile may simply be making it up to customers. Or it could be continuing to test Pandora's suitability as an acquisition/content partner.My calculations still suggest a merger, if one was pursued, would generate substantial synergies.If a wireless carrier wants a merger, Pandora is hands down the best target.","Around the holidays last year, I noted in one of my articles that T-Mobile (TMUS) was offering its customers free music service with increasing regularity and speculated that it could be a harbinger of a new initiative in the music space by the Un-Carrier. Since T-Mobile has just made some fresh moves in this area, I want to keep readers updated and offer analysis on the latest developments.My original thesis, simply stated, was that there are more synergies between wireless carriers and music services than popularly assumed due to the architecture of wireless networks. I speculated that T-Mobile, which had offered free music through its T-Mobile Tuesdays program for five of the last six months going into December, would continue to do so and at some point, might even graduate to just buying a music service itself for the synergies.My thesis was, well, not a home run. T-Mobile let the last promo - Pandora (P) - run out and didn't run another for four months. Not my first time being wrong, and I mostly just chalked it up to experience and moved on. But last week, T-Mobile offered another three months of Pandora Premium again, and there was some interesting content suggesting that perhaps T-Mobile is at least kicking the tires on music.There were three things that made what would appear to be just another Tuesday thanking at T-Mobile a little more interesting. I will briefly cover each, then offer a quick analysis.First was the timing. T-Mobile didn't just offer Pandora, a way of the famously consumer-centered Un-Carrier saying it thinks Pandora's service is worthy of its customers. For the first time, it seemed to say which services it thinks aren't worthy, as well.See, this wasn't T-Mobile's first return to the music space in 2018. T-Mobile offered another music service, TuneIn Premium, only just last month - and it was for a two-month free trial.That means T-Mobile did something it's never done before in the almost two years, it's been giving out free stuff: it offered a music subscription before the clock had run out on its last free offer. Obviously, that overlap means its promo dollars don't go as far they could have. So T-Mobile probably had a reason to do it this way.Second was the eligibility. This is the first time T-Mobile has gone back and offered a second go-around at a music service it has already featured. And it came the same way all its other offers have, with some fine print. The deal, like all the music deals T-Mobile has done, was only available to new customers of the music service. Which means that anyone who took advantage of the last one couldn't take advantage of this one, even though their three months are up and they could use a free upgrade like everyone else.An interesting gamble for T-Mobile to take since it probably disappointed some of its Tuesday devotees, who are among its most passionate customers. Of course, it was hardly an insurmountable problem - customers could still get the deal just by tying the offer to a different email address. But that was not entirely satisfactory since anyone who does that basically has to start over in terms of liking songs, building playlists, etc. It is an inconvenience, something T-Mobile doesn't usually inflict on its customers.Third was the choice of service for T-Mobile's first ""second pass"" in music. It chose Pandora, the trailer in the music wars. But perhaps it did this because Pandora is also the company with the best overlap with T-Mobile's own operations. Like T-Mobile, Pandora is a US-exclusive company with a large customer base. And it is currently trading for below my estimates of the synergies T-Mobile could extract from it, even after its 50% rise in the past month.In other words, it is hands down the most attractive target if T-Mobile was inclined to go shopping.There are a couple of different ways to interpret this, and most of them still don't paint my music-wireless synergy theory in the best light, I'll be the first to admit. But it seems clear regardless that TuneIn did not live up to consumer expectations, and apparently, T-Mobile wanted to make it up to them by offering a replacement.TuneIn, for those not aware, takes a different approach to streaming audio than most of the other companies that T-Mobile has featured. Even its $10 monthly option features commercials, and it doesn't offer an on-demand option. It tries to make up for by including podcasts and even some audio sports content. But apparently, T-Mobile's customers weren't feeling it. So, that can be considered a failed experiment.The real question is, what does this say about T-Mobile's possible future in music. I think a case can be made, this strengthens my theory somewhat since T-Mobile is devoting a considerable portion of its music bandwidth - when it occupies the space, which it doesn't always do - to the company best suited to a merger, despite the fact that Pandora is not consumers' first choice generally in the music market right now.When T-Mobile entered video streaming, it went straight for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the king of the space, despite the fact that Netflix wasn't willing to offer much of a discount for T-Mobile's bulk purchase. But that's in part because T-Mobile had already decided not to copy AT&T's (T) approach of buying a major video company. But here, T-Mobile skipped over Spotify (SPOT) - the market leader who charges the same per month as Pandora - and went to the trailer company.But that's admittedly not the only way of looking at it. Another interpretation is that music is simply one of several goodies T-Mobile likes to hand out from time to time, that it made its customers unhappy with its choice of TuneIn, and it wanted to make it up to them. It's refusal to include existing customers, which it would certainly have to do if it made Pandora a permanent part of its arsenal, probably lends further credence to that, more conservative interpretation.In fact, some might understandably wonder if T-Mobile didn't just turn around and do the same dish to Pandora, too. Just days after Pandora Premium came back into the Tuesdays fold, T-Mobile announced that this week's thanking would include a subscription to Gold's Gym app, a fitness app which incorporates DJ playlists for workout music. So, does that mean Pandora, one of my holdings, is failing by the same logic as I applied to TuneIn?No, I don't think so. Gold's Gym is a fine app for fitness enthusiasts and a worthy addition to T-Mobile's Thursday repertoire. But it's not a general-purpose music app and doesn't offer access to a wide range of songs. It's basically just a curated list of workout-appropriate songs from Gym DJs. So, I don't consider that a real music service offering. I don't think offering it says anything about how well Pandora is doing on the platform. Especially, since the deal to offer Gold's would have had to have been made before T-Mobile could even get any consumer feedback.If there was a merger, my analysis suggested that there could be some $300 million a year in synergies to be exploited by T-Mobile. That would be worth some $6 billion at a 5% discount rate, and Pandora could be bought at $12 per share, a substantial premium, for only $3 billion - leaving T-Mobile to reap the other half.Even more interesting is that those synergies are not limited to T-Mobile. Any wireless carrier would benefit from offering a music service structured, as I explained in my last article, to minimize the weight of the streaming on the network. AT&T spends roughly twice what T-Mobile does on its network every year, which would only amplify the synergies. At $12 billion in NPV, AT&T could offer $18 per share and keep more than half the benefits. Same goes for Verizon (VZ) as well. Sprint (S) already owns Tidal, so there's probably not much there.A merger would certainly be a major development, but actually, it doesn't change my stock recommendations much. Either way, I remain bullish on Pandora, which I think has a solid future as either an independent operation or as a merger target. Spotify has far more subscribers, but I am leery since it is valued far more richly, and I think the path to profitability is less clear. I am also bullish on T-Mobile, especially if they can hoover up Sprint's spectrum for a fraction of what it's worth. I would not go long on AT&T, which I consider exposed to the Pay-TV market far too heavily."
4167863,20510,2018-05-01T04:06:33-04:00,T-Mobile and Sprint to combine in all-stock deal.T-Mobile's John Legere will be CEO.Deal must pass regulatory muster to finalize.,"T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) have announced that the two cell companies intend to merge in a deal worth $26 billion. The value of the combined company would be in the neighborhood of $146 billion. This would combine the nation's #3 and #4 carriers to create a stronger #3. Verizon (VZ) is the biggest carrier with rival AT&T (T) slightly behind. The newly combined entity would retain the T-Mobile name and would put 127 million customers under one proverbial roof.The terms of the deal are a bit complex, but as an all-stock deal, it would avoid costly tax implications. T-Mobile will exchange 9.75 Sprint shares for 1 T-mobile unit. Deutsche Telekom will control 42% of the combined unit while SoftBank (which controlled 85% of Sprint stock going into the deal) will control 27% of the new entity. With the stakes of the two big institutional players figured out, that leaves 31% of the stock available to the public.This deal has been rumored for quite some time, but the players involved never seemed to be able to get it across the finish line. With the marriage finally seeming to be set, all that is left is approval by U.S. regulators. Investors should not expect that to be an easy task. Look for Sprint and T-Mobile to argue that the deal will help the company build out a robust 5G LTE network that is the next step in the world of cellular. The companies will also likely argue that the scale and size of their main competitors makes it difficult for the smaller carriers to compete. Verizon and AT&T both sport market caps above $200 billion. Verizon has 149 million customers, and AT&T boasts 134 million.If one looks at some of the metrics, you can see why these two getting together makes sense. Both T-Mobile and Sprint have higher churn than Verizon and AT&T, and both have lower average revenue per user (ARPU). Combining two smaller players will allow these entities to work on improving churn as well as enhancing revenue retention.Chart Source - Fierce WirelessFrom an investor's perspective, this deal has some interesting dynamics. In my opinion, this is better for Sprint in the near term and better for T-Mobile in the longer term. That opinion comes with a big caveat. The street is already expressing concern about how regulators will look at this deal. The street sees a lot of hurdles and feels that the deal will take a lot of time to come to fruition at great expense. Until there is a formal submission to regulators and the ""experts"" begin to weigh the odds in favor of approval, both Sprint and T-Mobile will have a cloud over their heads. The biggest job for management of both companies in the near term is ""selling"" the benefits of the deal to the street in preparation for ""selling"" the benefits to federal regulators.In my opinion, Legere is a great pitchman and will be able to set the stage for how this deal is perceived. The immediate hit of over 10% on Sprint and 5% on T-Mobile will be a near term frustration for investors, but is likely an overreaction to the challenges of getting past regulators. In the end, it is my opinion that regulators will allow the deal to pass in some form as long as there are assurances and guarantees that consumers will not be hurt. This will be a lengthy process, so timing your investments needs to be considered. Stay Tuned!"
4174535,20149,2018-05-16T03:17:17-04:00,"TMUS shares are trading around multi-year lows despite strong execution and the possibility of a Sprint merger.Investors today are getting a great price for TMUS on a standalone basis, with the market evidently assuming near-zero probability of Sprint deal closing.Even without Sprint, TMUS now trades at just 11x projected 2019 free cash flow.","The best investments are oftentimes those that come with multiple ways to win. Shares of T-Mobile (TMUS) are now trading well below the levels they were prior to the announcement that they will try to get government approval for a Sprint merger (implying negative odds of approval), as well as at multi-year lows despite strong operating performance that exceeds the competition.Below are four ways investors can win by buying TMUS today in the mid 50's:1) On a standalone basis, TMUS is performing superblyA few short years ago T-Mobile was uncool and sitting firmly in fourth place within the U.S. wireless sector. CEO John Legere has focused on attracting younger customers (where the growth is) and is willing to gamble on new sales and service initiatives to transform the sector. As a result, other competitors are forced to copy TMUS, on ideas such as including Netflix (NFLX) with service plans and scrapping data limits and contracts.The results have been no less than staggering, with TMUS adding more net new postpaid customers in 2017 than Verizon (VZ), AT&T (T), and Sprint (S) combined:Source: Fourth quarter financial reports from each company2) The stock's current valuation is around 11x 2019 free cash flow ex-SprintT-Mobile's success has not come with any compromise from the financial side of the equation (after all, it is easy to add customers when profits are not important). According to TMUS's annual 10-K filings, free cash flow has surged from $690 million in 2015 to $2.725 billion in 2017. On a per-share basis, the figures amount to a jump from $0.84 to $3.13. With high fixed costs, each new customer is incrementally very profitable. TMUS has laid out guidance for 2019 free cash flow of $4.55 billion, or roughly $5.30 per share. That puts today's valuation at just 11x next year's free cash flow, a very low price for a company that is still adding new customers.3) The company is using free cash flow to aggressively repurchase shares, which supports investors even if no merger with Sprint occursDespite a possible deal to buy Sprint, TMUS's board of directors authorized a $1.5 billion stock repurchase plan in December 2017. As of April 27, 2018, the company has spent the entire $1.5 billion on 23.7 million shares and announced a new authorization for another $7.5 billion through 2020. And that announcement was made knowing full well about the Sprint merger aspirations (only $500 million is slated for the rest of 2018).4) A deal with Sprint could very well be approved and the potential synergies are impressiveIt seems odd that T-Mobile shares are lower today than they were when the Sprint deal was announced. Not only does there appear to be a decent chance of getting approval (the arguments for the #3 and #4 wireless players teaming up to battle the two juggernauts in 5G technology are very strong), but it is hard to argue that T-Mobile has not done a lot to bring down prices in recent years. The idea that they would completely shift strategies after merging with Sprint holds little water. After all, T-Mobile's disruptive business model is working well and they are adding more customers than anyone else.To give you an idea of how big the cost synergies are in this deal, consider that T-Mobile has announced a projected annual run-rate of $6 billion for the combined entity (on a net present value basis, they estimate $43 billion of synergies). Compared with T-Mobile's current stand-alone market value of $49 million, this deal would serve investors extremely well. If the deal happens, it is not unreasonable to think the stock could rise by 60% ($43 billion of synergies layered onto the combined current equity values of both firms of $68 billion) to a level of $90 per share within 2-3 years post-closing. That price would equate to roughly 13 times a $7 per share free cash flow figure (and that $7 could be low given TMUS should surpass $5 on their own next year).In summary, investors can win with TMUS regardless of whether the coin lands on heads or tails. On a standalone basis, TMUS should continue to take market share, boost free cash flow, and buy back stock. In baseball terms, that is probably a double. However, if the government decides they would not mind three companies of roughly equal size vying for 5G dominance, the Sprint deal could very well happen (no reason to think 25% odds are unreasonable, although I think it might be as high as 50/50). If that happens, TMUS should be a home run for shareholders and customers alike."
4167362,24206,2018-04-29T16:56:58-04:00,"The final price for this deal is slightly above Sprint's raw book value (assets-liabilities).
        T-Mobile is getting Sprint for less than Sprint's enterprise value.
        But Sprint is not exactly an unvarnished gem.","The big news today is that T-Mobile (TMUS) will buy Sprint (S) for $26.5 billion. From Bloomberg:As I'll show below, T-Mobile is getting a good deal. But that's because Sprint just isn't that great of a company. What's Sprint really worth? Let's start with book value: assets - liabilities. This is the most basic valuation measurement available:  (data from Morningstar.com; author's calculations)All I've done here is to subtract total assets from total liabilities (in blue). According to this measure, Sprint is worth $18.8 billion, which makes the $26.6 billion bid 141% higher than Sprint's 2017 book value. I've added a second calculation (above in red), where I remove goodwill from the measure. Personally, I detest goodwill. If you ask 10 different accountants what a company's goodwill is, you will get 10 answers. Using that calculation, book value at the end of 2017 was $12.2 billion, which means T-Mobile paid more than twice Sprint's book value. Regardless of which measurement you use, the total cost is at a premium. But, paying 1.5x-2x book value for one of the four major cell phone companies isn't really that pricey. Next up, let's look at Sprint's market capitalization. According to Finviz.com, Sprint has 3.71 billion shares outstanding. At $6/share that's $22.6 billion. Again, T-Mobile is paying a premium, but not much above current market value. Let's next look at enterprise value, where we also include total debt and cash in the calculation (for the sake of simplicity, I'm skipping the preferred and minority interest parts of the equation, just to keep this ""back of the envelope"" friendly). According to Sprint's latest balance sheet, they have $35 billion in debt and $8.3 billion in cash. Assuming Sprint's debt is trading at par, the company's enterprise value is $48.90 billion (22.26 + 35 - 8.3). Even if we assume that Sprint's debt is trading at 50 cents on the dollar, Sprint's enterprise value is $31.46 billion ($22.26+17.5-8.3). This is a far more complete value measurement and shows that T-Mobile is getting a pretty good deal.But the final amount is low fora very a very important reason: Sprint has problems. I compared the four major wireless carriers a few months ago and had this to say about Sprint:Here's a chart of the basic problem Sprint is facing:(Data from Morningstar.com; author's calculation)There are three categories of cash flow on the cash flow statement. The first is ""cash from operations."" This category shows how much actual cash (as in physical dollars) the company's operations generate over a twelve-month period. The second category is ""cash spent on investments,"" which shows the company's capital outlays. If the company is very profitable, it can self-fund investment, which ultimately means it doesn't have to get third-party financing to continue as a going concern. But if a company is cash poor, it needs third-party cash on a regular basis. And that is Sprint's real problem: every year, they needed to either issue debt, issue equity, or get a loan to get cash. They chose debt:  In three of the last five years, Sprint issued an average of $5.4 billion dollars of debt. This situation is unsustainable; at some point, the debt burden becomes too high for the company.This is the reason why Sprint would eventually be sold. And it also means that while T-Mobile gets Sprint's customer base and network assets, they're also buying some problems. This post is not an offer to buy or sell this security. It is also not specific investment advice for a recommendation for any specific person. Please see our disclaimer for additional information."
4163763,97946,2018-04-18T12:30:54-04:00,"Sprint and T-Mobile's on-again/off-again tie-up is, for now, looking like it may be back on.Options prices for both are high; selling puts/calls against existing positions is lucrative on both a short- and long-term time scale.Why sell options here? Sprint's stock price is very near the indicated merger agreement that was ultimately dropped in November, making for a great option selling set-up.","In the only M&A deal that seems more drawn-out than a soap opera and more laborious than the delivery of a baby, it was reported last week that talks between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) are being raised from the dead once more. This news has drastic implications for equity holders, but particularly those of Sprint, and I believe both longs and shorts in the name must change their strategy in light of the news. Indeed, the shares of both Sprint and T-Mobile spiked on the news, as many (if not all) analysts assume that a tie-up between the two would be both mutually beneficial and inevitable:S data by YChartsThese merger talks necessitate a change in the approach to your position in Sprint (and possibly T-Mobile), as I will detail here. Most important is the fact that Sprint is already trading right around the price that T-Mobile was willing to offer in November of 2017, when the deal seemed likely to close. As a reminder, that deal pegged the value of Sprint ""at market"", which in the fall of 2017 was right around $6.50 per share; other analysts have placed the standalone value of the company at around $4 per share. Importantly, Sprint is currently trading around $6 per share ($5.95 as of writing). This has a huge implication: if the negotiations proceed as before, the value of Sprint equity is already close to the previously negotiated take-out price, and likely above the value of Sprint on its own. As before, we can essentially surmise that both Sprint and T-Mobile are fairly stubborn, and will draw this process of negotiating out. What are the implications for investors? Here are a few:As a reminder, I previously advocated for this strategy in a Seeking Alpha article; following my advice in that article would have been profitable for shorts, and would have severely curtailed the losses of long investors in Sprint. Here's how, for example, an investor wishing to sell a covered call on Sprint's stock would calculate their returns:Thus, by selling at-the-money options, an investor can guarantee approximately 6% return on their investment in 45 days by selling the June option. After looking at the numbers, I'm actually quite surprised how relatively small the difference is between the premium received in selling the June option (~6%) vs. the premium from the August option (~9%); you're only getting 50% more premium for selling an option that covers nearly 3x the calendar! Regardless, these options prices are fairly large, for an equity that we are fairly certain is close to its takeout value, and also for one without a specified end to the negotiations.Here's what the difference in the two strategies yields. On the left, we have the result of holding the stock of Sprint, assuming a buyout at $6.50 which is announced in 6 months. On the right, we have the result of selling the June $6 covered call (annualized for the next 6 months), until the takeout announcement. As calculated, your return increases 62% by selling covered calls, even after accounting for the difference in share price.It's important to understand what makes this situation different from blindly selling volatility on other stocks: we have an idea (although not a concrete one) of what the final value of the stock of Sprint is likely to be, as given during the negotiations last fall. Thus, if we sell options at or near that price, we are unlikely to see losses that are substantially out of proportion to the rewards from writing premiums. Of course, it's always possible that something unexpected happens, like T-Mobile deciding to offer $8 per share for Sprint; however, I believe that if that were the strategy, T-Mobile would have already offered an outrageously high price like that during the last round of negotiations.In conclusion, I believe that selling volatility in the direction of your view of Sprint's equity (bullish or bearish) is superior to holding the stock for this specific situation: Sprint's equity price is unlikely to be drastically different at takeout, while options premiums are high enough to rationalize selling the volatility.As a final word, I would like to add that options trading should only be undertaken by experienced investors, and that naked options are really best left to professionals; however, I think this situation offers a unique opportunity for investors to used covered calls to both decrease their risk and increase their potential gains."
4141970,95916,2018-01-31T22:02:59-05:00,"T-Mobile's P/E has fallen from over 60 to market average as the stock has treaded water for the last year.The company's operational and financial profile has substantially improved as net income growth has accelerated with increasing scale.T-Mobile's new TV initiative remains in early stages with details still not known, but appears to have great potential.Even if TV doesn't work out, Layer3 may offer substantial improvements to the core wireless platform by scaling video up to HD without increasing bandwidth.","My history with T-Mobile (TMUS) has been a hot-and-cold one. I was one of the first believers in its turnaround, Un-Carrier strategy going all the way back to 2013 when its stock more than tripled over a two-year period. However, I bailed out way too soon, advising selling at $38 in November 2015 when it launched Binge On. I believed the network couldn’t take it and congestion would heavily damage the service and the brand.I was wrong. The stock kept going all the way up to $68, with the P/E peaking at over 60. But I remained deeply ambivalent and only recently have begun to ease my concerns. I took another look at T-Mobile tonight and for the first time in over two years I am considering returning it to my portfolio. In addition to its wireless performance metrics, which remain strong, I am increasingly intrigued by T-Mobile’s excursion outside the wireless sphere into TV.T-Mobile’s core business remains wireless service and it forms the foundation for any other initiatives the company might make. So any bullish case for T-Mobile has to begin by demonstrating that the foundation remains solid.T-Mobile has moved to address some of my most serious concerns by reformulating its network congestion management policies and drastically increasing its net income growth per subscriber. As for network quality, it is acquiring more spectrum to handle the load, at a surprisingly bargain price. It has also just plain proven me wrong, maintaining high network performance through superior engineering even under the burden of a growing video torrent in its service.I am growing increasingly comfortable with T-Mobile’s valuation, despite the collapse of the Sprint (S) merger which would have added considerably to its value via Sprint’s treasure trove of high-band spectrum. In fact, with the stock having more or less treaded water for the last year, while its net income growth has accelerated, its P/E has now fallen below 26, putting it almost on par with the S&P average. And its growth does not show signs of slowing down. This would suggest that T-Mobile is, for the first time in a while, actually undervalued.While it is still early days, T-Mobile has also begun to tease investors with the potential for its increasingly profitable wireless service to fund a breakout into an entirely new industry, one which also has very high revenues and potential for profit: television.T-Mobile acquired Layer3, an IPTV television provider, late last year and is now gearing up to launch a major new Pay-TV initiative. T-Mobile hopes to bring the same Un-Carrier philosophy that served it so well in wireless into the cable-TV space. And it may very well work: like wireless five years ago, TV offers opaque service agreements with substantial anti-consumer provisions that retard competition and choice.T-Mobile customer service, meanwhile, continues to receive top industry marks, which will really stand out against the abysmal reputation customer service cable companies like Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter (CHTR) suffer from. Meanwhile, T-Mobile also says its new service will be contract-free, which will set it apart from DISH Network (DISH) and rival AT&T’s (T) DIRECTV.As I said, without details that remains somewhat speculative. However, it may very well be that Layer3 can be a good acquisition even if TV never launched at all. It may also have some spillover benefits for regular mobile customers.One of the things that attracted T-Mobile to Layer3 is that it has apparently found a way to transmit high-definition signals using only one-third the bandwidth of a typical signal. That system has not yet been fully scaled, so we will see if it can go nationwide without hiccups. Assuming it can, however, that kind of compression breakthrough would make HD signals about the same bandwidth as 480p signals now.This will allow T-Mobile to host large numbers of Pay-TV providers on its own mobile network if TV goes well. But it will also present a major opportunity in its wireless offering. T-Mobile’s growth in the past two years has been a product in considerable part of its Binge On initiative, which throttles video over the mobile network down to 480p in exchange for unlimited video streaming at no extra cost.“Free” always sounds good to customers, and the resolution shouldn’t matter since the human eye can’t perceive 1080p pixels on a screen that small anyway. Still, customers know the signal is being degraded and it has been a disincentive for some, who must either pay a surcharge for full HD or shop around another network, potentially costing T-Mobile customers.T-Mobile’s throttling - sorry, optimizing - video policy is borne of necessity. Without it the network could never handle all the video passing over it. But Layer3’s new technology, if validated at scale, could allow T-Mobile to have its cake and eat it too. If HD signals can be passed over the network at comparable bandwidths to the current SD signals, T-Mobile may be on the verge of offering its customers a major upgrade to their mobile video signals.I consider T-Mobile’s average P/E ratio a substantial undervalue and it is the first time in a while I can wholeheartedly say that. While a P/E of 26 is still not exactly a figure that screams value, T-Mobile seems to have substantial growth prospects still untapped, in both TV and mobile.This past year T-Mobile’s customer growth fell from 8 million to 5 million subscribers, but its net income growth per subscriber skyrocketed. After holding at $60 per subscriber for three years, it rose to almost $150 per subscriber over the last nine months, more than doubling. That more than compensates for the decline in subscription growth. If even one more year of such growth persists, T-Mobile may be undervalued by as much as 30%.It’s been a while since I’ve said this: I consider T-Mobile a buy."

        I am encouraged by record levels of customer acquisition and margins that have been relatively resilient compared to the peer group.
        TMUS may find its way into my portfolio for the first time very soon.","T-Mobile (TMUS) is looking more appealing by the day.On Thursday, the company delivered another decent quarter that, granted, saw revenues land a hair below Street's expectations. The ""uncarrier"" continues to be perhaps the best performer in the U.S. telecom space, but now with an important difference: the stock is starting to look a lot more affordable.Credit: BGRT-Mobile's 5% YOY top-line growth was the lowest that the company has seen in the past eight quarters. Yet, the comps were really tough this quarter, following a 4Q16 that had pushed sales higher by an astounding 23%.Helping to support revenues were branded postpaid phone ARPU (average revenue per unit) of $46.38 that, while not a record-high number, deteriorated less than I would have expected amid a fiercely competitive landscape. Perhaps even more encouraging were postpaid net additions of 1.2 million customers that were the highest since at least 1Q16. As the graph below illustrates, T-Mobile continues to defend its position as the most successful U.S.-based carrier of 2016-2017, having accumulated more net adds in the period than its two large domestic competitors combined.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from multiple company reportsBut T-Mobile's solid results were not only a story of high customer additions and increased service revenues. The Bellevue-based company also managed to keep gross margins healthy at 53.2%, only a moderate decrease of 60 bps compared to last year's numbers. Considering the pricing pressure in the telecom space that is unlikely to subside, I believe T-Mobile has been doing a good job at keeping margins afloat.In terms of opex, the company spent a bit more compared to last year: 44.4% as a percentage of total sales vs. 44.0% in 4Q16. However, the resulting mild op margin deterioration is not much of a concern and remained within the realm of reason, in my view. Lastly, a large piece of the three-cent YOY improvement in EPS seems to have come not from operations but a lower tax rate, which may help to explain yesterday's timid stock price reaction to what I considered to be a solid quarter.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company earnings reportI have been keeping an eye on TMUS since at least early last year. Never pessimistic about the company itself, I often found the stock too pricey to encourage me to become a shareholder. But once the forward earnings multiple reached the mid-20s in October, I ""started to see the appeal of TMUS with fewer restrictions"".Today, T-Mobile still looks like a very competitive telecom player, while the stock has reached price levels that I find very enticing and perhaps not properly representative of the quality of the business. Forward P/E has now dipped decisively into the mid-teens and PEG has reached a very low 0.6x, in part pushed by the steep broad stock market selloff of the past week.At these levels, TMUS has definitely entered my radar as a potential buy. Following a bit more due diligence, it is plausible that this stock may find its way into my portfolio for the first time very soon."
4167464,22148,2018-04-30T08:09:26-04:00,"Sprint and T-Mobile announced a merger agreement on Sunday morning, ending years of negotiations.The deal values Sprint close to the current market valuation at $6.62 per share.The stock will struggle during a messy regulatory approval process with the only upside from a unlikely deal approval.","On Sunday morning, Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) finally announced an agreement to merge after years of negotiations and speculation. Regardless of the news flow, Sprint shareholders aren't any closer to gains due to valuation and regulatory concerns similar to my investment thesis a few weeks back.Source: John Legere on TwitterThe wireless companies announced the deal valuation for Sprint at an enterprise value of $59 billion. The problem for shareholders is that the stock traded far above this range for most of 2017.The all-stock transaction has an exchange ratio of 0.10256 of a T-Mobile share for each Sprint share. Based on T-Mobile ending last week at $64.52, the deal values Sprint at $6.62 per share. Depending on how TMUS trades when the market opens on Monday, S is likely to trade down from the $6.50 close.The reason for the weak pricing is that Sprint is clearly in a desperate situation. The wireless company might have the spectrum for 5G, but it doesn't have the balance sheet to compete in the sector against AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ).Sprint had $32 billion in debt at the end of 2017 and lacks the capacity to borrow for additional capital spending to build out a robust 5G network. One will note that Sprint issues more press releases on wireless spectrum-backed debt than updating the market on the 5G network progress with that spectrum.The biggest issue with the deal is the lack of regulatory uncertainty and the general assumption that this deal won't get approved. Not only did AT&T and T-Mobile get blocked back in 2011 when the sector was more dominated by the industry giants, but the DOJ is now trying to block AT&T from merging with Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) in a vertical deal.My previous research discussed the risks to consolidation to three national carriers due to the Canadian example. iMore calls the Canadian mobile market fast and expensive with limited distinction in the major network offerings for the iPhone. The lack of competition has left ARPU levels amongst the highest in the world, making the hurdle very high for Sprint and T-Mobile to prove a merger won't harm consumers.AT&T just reported a quarter where the company lost 22,000 postpaid phone net subscribers, and analysts at Morgan Stanley (via FierceWireless) expect Sprint and T-Mobile to outperform. Possibly this deal is a harbinger that Sprint will miss these targets, but the recent results don't suggest the struggles warrants needing a merger. If anything, the results support the thesis of the FCC that ""effective competition"" now exists in the domestic wireless market.Beyond these issues, shareholders face a risk that isn't really that the deal gets blocked, but that the stock goes nowhere for 18 months. For various reasons, the AT&T/Time Warner deal and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)/NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) deals haven't offered much upside for shareholders holding through the regulatory process, with both mergers being consummated in October 2016.TWX data by YChartsIn both of those cases, the shareholders had the opportunity to dump either Time Warner or NXP Semiconductors during the regulatory process as the stocks rose into expected approvals, while one would've done better with the S&P 500 index. The upside to those shareholders was the completion of deals letting them mostly cash out of their shares at premium valuations. The upside for Sprint is years after the completion of the deal. The upside occurs after the deal is completed, once the $6 billion in estimated run rate cost synergies are realized over multiple years along with the elimination of the domestic price wars.Source: Sprint/T-Mobile merger presentationSprint isn't likely to rise above the offer price until regulatory risk is gone, and that isn't going to happen with T-Mobile dominating the domestic wireless service growth and subscription additions. Basically, the stock has no upside on a deal and throughout a messy regulatory approval process.The key investor takeaway is that the long-term value of a Sprint/T-Mobile deal is in the cost synergies of a combined 5G network and reduced competitive scenario in the domestic wireless sector once a merger is approved by regulators. The value doesn't exist for Sprint shareholders from a merger agreement, but rather not until completing a positive regulatory ordeal.Similar to the reasons last year, Sprint appears desperate for a merger, and shareholders will never win in that situation. The wireless company will be in bad shape after spending billions to complete a failed merger, so the downside risk is significant."
4132912,39141,2017-12-20T05:37:13-05:00,"It seems T-Mobile will not be acquiring Sprint.Nevertheless, T-Mobile is unquestioningly in the best position of US telecoms.Telecoms is becoming an increasingly fluid industry, where financial flexibility is important, and forward returns may not be what they used to be.","Today I had time to listen to a roadshow from one of my favorite companies, T-Mobile US (TMUS). In it, Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter said that there would be no acquisition deal with Sprint (S), despite the long negotiations leading up to that decision. While that can be discouraging, it's important to remember that T-Mobile still has awesome momentum in the US telecom industry.I'm not all that bummed by the talks of acquisition breaking down, and I still believe that T-Mobile is the disruptive competitor in the US, and that it will continue 'disrupting' the landscape for years to come. This article takes a look at T-Mobile's latest quarterly performance, and what investors can expect going forward. As with most articles I write, this article will also look at T-Mobile from an income investor's perspective, even though T-Mobile pays no dividend.Pole positionWhen it comes to US telecoms, there is no doubt that T-Mobile is best positioned for the future of communications. This is because T-Mobile, when it spun off from Deutsche Telekom in 2011, saw where consumer preferences were going and methodically worked to satisfy them. The company devoted itself and all its capital to building a network designed for unlimited data use. Management saw that all content was going to the internet, and that the internet was going mobile, then acted accordingly. Because T-Mobile did not have a weighty dividend obligation like AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) did, not to mention several legacy businesses, T-Mobile was able to build out a network ideally suited to handle unlimited data use for each subscriber, and offer it at a very competitive fixed rate.Management called this ""the un-carrier strategy,"" and consumers responded in a profound way. Quarter after quarter, for years, T-Mobile was able to post net postpaid smartphone adds of over a million per quarter. AT&T and Verizon went nearly stagnant while T-Mobile sucked up all the growth and then some.This last quarter was hardly an exception. Post paid smart phone adds were 1.3 million, with service revenue rising 7%, EPS up 50% and cash flow from operations up 39%, all year-on-year. T-Mobile has had the fastest network for 15 quarters in a row.Expect that trend to continue, and expect T-Mobile to continue gaining share from AT&T and Verizon. I say this for a couple reasons. The first reason is financial flexibility. AT&T and Verizon do not have as much wiggle room as T-Mobile, because the latter pay most of their free cash flow to shareholders in the form of a dividend. Second, both AT&T and Verizon have gone on acquisition sprees in an attempt to stay relevant with consumers who increasingly merge communication with entertainment. However, in acquiring businesses such as AOL, DirecTV, Huffington Post and Yahoo, AT&T and Verizon could well just be acquiring declining businesses and bundling them together.T-Mobile, on the other hand, has worked to do one thing and do it well: Provide fast, abundant data for mobile consumers. That's it. So far, T-Mobile has left the advertising, content, and delivery platforms to do what they do on their own. That's a different approach, but I think it is ultimately going to be a winning strategy. People don't like arbitrary 'bundles,' particularly when it comes to the internet. They like things on demand and à la carte, and so far that is what T-Mobile is offering. I believe this will be the strategy that ultimately delivers what consumers want.ValuationAt 25.5 times trailing earnings, T-Mobile is by no means cheap. Nor should it be. Although there is no management guidance for calendar 2018, analyst consensus is for 15% EPS growth, and 21% EPS growth in 2019. This is a stock you should buy on any weakness, as I don't see AT&T or Verizon drastically altering course to start taking share from T-Mobile, perhaps not ever.Courtesy of Google Finance.T-Mobile is a stock that is to be bought on weakness. In early November shares had dropped by over 10% to just over $55. Any dip is a good time to pick up shares of T-Mobile. At that time I was unfortunately unable to write any articles. Had I had more time and was able to, I would have emphatically recommended it.Is T-Mobile a good pick for dividend investors? That is debatable. T-Mobile does not pay a dividend. Earlier this year management briefly considered paying a ""small dividend,"" but decided against it precisely because it inhibited their financial flexibility.Typically I am a quite the believer in dividend-paying companies, particularly ones that grow their dividends. However, these are revolutionary times for telecoms, when consumers are moving everything to the internet, and the internet is going mobile. That will have major implications for telecommunications, entertainment and other things.For example, internet users are increasingly going to 'streaming' on-demand content, and will not accept the arbitrary boundaries, bundles and pay walls that have been part of cable TV since its beginning. The result of this is ""cord cutting."" Similar things are happening in telecommunications; consumers want unlimited data use for a fixed, reasonable price. They aren't going to accept the data charges of the past, and telecoms are simply going to have to get on board or get out of the way. All of this leads to a need for much more 5G spectrum, one way or the other, and I do not expect telecoms or cable companies to reap the tidy returns that they have in decades past. The situation is now much more competitive, with more power in the hands of consumers.In the long run, T-Mobile will eventually have to pay a dividend, but for the time being, management is right in considering dividends an unnecessary burden. If this industry were more of an oligopoly like it were, I would be more apt to go for higher dividend payers, but for now, telecoms in North America is an industry in flux, and there's no doubt that T-Mobile is now in the best position exactly because it can be financially flexible. Perhaps when, or if, the industry settles back down, T-Mobile may start paying a dividend. Until then, I much prefer T-Mobile over AT&T or Verizon."
4149667,84726,2018-02-23T16:01:29-05:00,"After a recent trade down, T-Mobile offers strong growth and operational excellence at a discount to recent historical levels.My interest in the name is driven by the recently announced buybacks, store count expansion, and continued M&A potential.At ~7x EBITDA, TMUS trades at a discount to its historical range; ~30% upside over 12-16 months.","T-Mobile (TMUS), a historically expensive company, is on sale. The recent trade down started at the end of January when there was rumor that the Trump Administration wanted to nationalize 5G. Then the market began its massive sell off at the beginning of February and then to pile on, on February 8th, T-Mobile reported somewhat disappointing earnings relative to investor expectations. Looking at these downside catalysts, the risk of the first factor is non-existent, the market sell-off is not company specific, and the company's earnings and guidance demonstrated strong earnings, net adds, and provided solid (and conservative) guidance moving forward.This is a particularly attractive buying opportunity as T-Mobile will be pushed higher over the next months due to a large buyback program, new retail locations in new markets increasing net adds, and the potential/reality of M&A in the sector involving T-Mobile.I recommend a long position in T-Mobile with an investment horizon of 12 - 16 months with a price target of $77.78. This valuation was determined by three methods:On Thursday, February 8th, T-Mobile reported earnings with record revenues but disappointed the street on those same revenue expectations. Adjusted EPS of $0.48 beat consensus estimates by $0.11 and reported $10.76 billion of revenue, missing expectations by $70.00 million.Net adds were 1.9 million with 1.1 million branded postpaid net adds and 891 thousand branded postpaid phone net adds. Postpaid churn fell from 1.28% to 1.18%. One of the few negatives of the quarter was that ARPU fell 4.1% y/y to $46.38. Branded prepaid ARPU was $38.63 (an increase of 1.1%). When compared to Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint - TMUS reported 2x, 3x, and 5x more net adds than the respective competitors.The company traded down ~5% on the day (Feb 8 th) after announcing these results as the street didn't like the revenue miss or the weaker than expected EBITDA guidance.Source: Yahoo Finance Closing DataThis trade down is initially what drew me back to look at T-Mobile as an investment. It is rare to find T-Mobile at a discount to itself historically. Below is the thesis that I developed after looking into TMUS further.While the T-Mobile long term story remains compelling and worthy of investment, the recently approved share repurchase program from T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom is an interesting short term catalyst. On the Q4 earnings call, John Legere announced ""we initiated a share buyback program in December of 2017. As of February 5, we have bought back 12.3 million shares for a total of $783 million. (Q4 Conference Call)"". The company has an authorization to purchase $1.5 billion in shares so there is a remaining ~$717 million left in the authorization.Below, I have modeled out two scenarios of the number of shares that can be bought back under the remaining TMUS authorization. One assumption looks at the share count reduction if TMUS were to repurchase all the remaining authorization at the current price. I think that it is safe to assume that the company is buying back shares right now considering that shares are below the company's one year average price ($62.93) after the stock's recent trade down due to earnings and market weakness. My second scenario looks at the buyback potential assuming the shares are repurchased at the average share price over the last twelve months - $62.93.Source: Yahoo Finance Closing PricesOne top of that, Deutsche Telekom, the majority shareholder in T-Mobile has told T-Mobile management that they will purchasing shares as well with CFO Carter suggesting that the buyback could be around $500 million. According to the 10K filing, these repurchases will occur within 2018.Source: 2017 10K, Current Share Price Data, and Company FilingsThese conservative assumptions could result in a 2% reduction in float - which is a major change for a company that has never had a corporate buyback.Source: Author ModelIn the income statement model included below - I used the current share price buyback model therefore assuming a 20,112,378 reduction in shares outstanding in 2018 alone. While I do not predict an expansion of the 2018 authorization plan during 2018, I model out two more years of buybacks through 2020. This assumption of 15 million shares of buybacks in 2019 and 2020 is driven by the assumption that TMUS will likely view their shares as undervalued in advance of a potential take out or the full roll out of 5G. TMUS will be able to afford this due to their lower tax rate and rising free cash flow.In 2018 and 2019, I model 3,000,000 and 2,750,000 net additions which are in line with TMUS' guidance for 2018. While TMUS will continue to capture net adds in existing markets due to the company's competitive network and innovative Un-Carrier model, moving forward the focus will continue to be on building out in new markets that are covered by the network but do not have a store or distribution point.In 2017, the company opened 1,500 net TMUS stores and 1,300 net new MetroPCS. 600 of these T-Mobile stores were in locations that were without an existing T-Mobile presence. The company now has 5,300 T-Mobile branded stores and 11,100 MetroPCS stores for a total of 16,400 stores. These new stores are not fully productive yet and the full results of these stores will be seen during 2018 (according to John Legere on the Q4 call).In 2018, the company stated that it will focus exclusively on building out in new markets which means that there will be little to no revenue cannibalization. In these green markets, T-Mobile will bring competition to towns that have TMUS coverage but only have access to competitors such as Verizon and AT&T stores. By bringing TMUS to the areas, the company will be able to steal customers who have long resented their carriers and had no good alternative. While it is difficult to quantify net adds relative to new store operations, the company will be able to what they do best in these markets (disrupt the market and steal new customers).With the company's increased cash flow, the company will be able to continue building out new stores likely on the same scale seen in 2017.Even though the most recent T-Mobile and Sprint talks have fallen apart, it is foolish to ignore the fact that in a consolidating media and telecom market, T-Mobile is undoubtedly an attractive target. Many investors remain interested and involved in the stock for this very reason. In fact, on the 4Q call, management emphasized that M&A will continue to happen in this industry (likely with them involved) after the finalization of the AT&T and Time Warner acquisition. Personally, I believe more consolidation will happen among the large companies after the AT&T and TWX and DIS and FOX acquisition closes.That being said, I do not believe that M&A becomes a factor again for the company until the Comcast, Charter agreement not to make an acquisition without the others approval expires (May 2018). Assuming that Comcast does not successfully make a higher bid for the Fox assets currently set to be acquired by Walt Disney, I view Comcast as the most likely acquirer. However, an acquisition could not happen until the back half of 2018 or 2019. That being said other merger and acquisition scenarios include Charter, Sprint, and Dish.In an acquisition scenario, I would look to see an EV/EBITDA multiple between 8.00 - 9.00x. It is hard to find a good precedent transaction to comp a T-Mobile take out against so I prefer to think of it from more of a premium perspective knowing that John Legere and the T-Mobile team value their business highly and have very high expectations of growth. I couldn't see the team accepting anything less than a 30% premium for the business in an acquisition scenario.Source: Author ModelHere I model out an 8.25x take out multiple which implies a 32% take out value relative to today's share price. While I think that this 8.25x multiple is conservative it offers a look at a potential acquisition scenario.Source: Company Filings, Author ModelWithin the wireless space, there is no hotter topic than 5G and is one of the most important topics of conversation when looking at long term growth and cost efficiency. There are also a great number of misconceptions in the market about 5G. T-Mobile will be rolling out a version of 5G into certain markets in 2019 by leveraging the 600 megahertz spectrum; however, this will not be the full standard conforming 5G that promises the blazing fast speeds of future. They plan to roll out the nationwide network in 2020. For those wishing to read more about the 5G arms race between Verizon and T-Mobile and the misconceptions about it - check out this article from BGR.The 5G that both companies are unleashing in 2018 and 2019 involve technology and software that makes the network more efficient and faster, but will showcase only a limited difference between LTE-Advanced networks. The real 5G will require the use of both low-band and high-band spectrum (BGR). The real 5G is 100x the speed vs. 4G - but this is different from what the carriers will be offering in 2018 and 2019. That being said, the average consumer won't know or understand that so T-Mobile and Verizon will be playing a marketing game to attempt to lure new customers attracted by new speeds. This will play a big part in marketing and revenue generation through 2018 and 2019. Nonetheless, the technology will work towards a much faster and more efficient technology that will result in cost savings and potentially allow T-Mobile to raise prices moving forward.While the full scale roll out of 5G is unclear, T-Mobile has continued to state that there is not ""large step function increase in CapEx when we look out into the future"" (4Q Earnings Call). With that in mind we maintained a fairly consistent capital expenditure.Source: Author Model5G and the roll out of the needed spectrum is a technical concept and I do not claim to be an expert but I definitely recommend reading more into this as it will continue to drive the discussion around the carriers through 2020. All this being said, I would not invest in this stock because of 5G as I see this as more of a medium term holding (12 - 16 months) and think that the benefits of 5G for shareholders are further out and more difficult to model.Moving into the model, I drove the income statement off of assumptions regarding postpaid and prepaid net adds and ARPU. Regarding postpaid additions, I assume a constant ARPU in line with the company's guidance for consistent ARPU in 2018 vs. 2017 and due to limited visibility past 2018, I choose to keep this constant moving forward. The company guided for 2 - 3 million net adds in 2018 (which was originally an underwhelming number to the market) and I chose to use the upper bound of the guidance range due to the company's historic tendency to provide weaker guidance than the numbers they actually expect.Source: Author ModelLooking now at branded prepaid users, I look to see mild decay in ARPU amid competitive pressures and mild net adds as more would-be TMUS customers looks to postpaid options.Source: Company Filings, Author ModelMoving into the model, I wanted to highlight that for 2018 I attempted to keep my inputs in line with company guidance and generally towards the top end of guidance. A few key points to highlight:Source: Company Filings and Author ModelLooking at this model, you can see that I model for EPS of $2.76 in 2018 followed by 20%, and 16% growth in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The growth number for 2018 EPS is skewed by the large EPS gain that occurred in 2017 due to the benefits from tax reform.Now it is time to look at T-Mobile from a valuation perspective. For the DCF I use an 8.50% WACC which is in line with the rough estimate provided by Bloomberg and sits between the estimates used by banks that range from 6.7% - 10.0%.Source: Bloomberg Terminal (2.19.2018)Below, with the use of an 8.50% WACC and a 2.00% perpetuity growth rate, I found an intrinsic share price of ~$84.00 a share. Important to note, I maintain a high level of CapEx that might be overkill beyond 2020.Source: Author ModelValuing T-Mobile on a comps basis is difficult as they are a growth company that operates in a very mature industry. That being said the main comps are Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint. I have included an extended comps set with the big three Canadian telcos as a reference to see the tight range that normal telecom carriers trade at.Source: Bloomberg Terminal Data (2.19.2018)When valued against the peer set, T-Mobile will almost always look overvalued; however, it is more interesting to look at the historical multiple that T-Mobile trades at relative to where it is currently trading at after the recent trade down.Below is a Bloomberg chart that demonstrates the PE (white line) and the EV/EBITDA (green line) multiples that TMUS has traded at over the last 5 years. What interests me most is the EV/EBITDA multiple which, when removing anomalies, normally trades in a 7 - 10x range. The company is currently trading at the low end of that range.Source: Bloomberg Terminal (2.19.2018)That being said, I applied a 7.5x EV/EBITDA multiple (which I believe to be conservative) which yielded a price target of $71.00 a share.Source: Company Filings, Author ModelUnder the assumptions highlighted in this article, I found a valuation of $71.00 a share through the multiples method, $83.68 through the discounted cash flow model, and $81.01 through an M&A analysis. Using a weighted average of my three different price targets I find an intrinsic value of ~$77.78 approximately a 30% upside to where shares currently trade.Thank you for reading this Seeking Alpha PRO article.

4133052,95916,2017-12-20T14:28:20-05:00,"T-Mobile has placed an emphasis on various music services this year in its Tuesdays giveaway program.Music is a popular service with consumers and may be T-Mobile's next content initiative after Netflix, and before cable-TV more broadly.If T-Mobile does incorporate a music service into its consumer offering, AT&T and Verizon would have to respond. This would be another pressure on wireless margins.Most music services would not be severely impacted, but Pandora and Spotify would be more exposed. Spotify might come out worse than Pandora, however.","This week will be a somewhat sad week for many T-Mobile (TMUS) subscribers, who are about to have to go back to paying for music subscription service again after getting the last three months on the house. They can thank John Legere’s T-Mobile Tuesdays customer rewards program for that. It offered three free months of Pandora Premium, the on-demand version of the iconic streaming radio company, in mid-September. Pandora (P) has admittedly fallen on some hard times lately. Doubtless that played a role in their decision to offer three months to T-Mobile subscribers, at what I’m sure was a substantial discount. But the service and its price taste no less sweet to T-Mobile subscribers for that. T-Mobile’s acquisition of Layer3, and its consequent implications for T-Mobile’s TV ambitions, have understandably been the focus of most of the analyst commentary on the company this past week. But TV is for 2018, and we’re not even sure what exactly T-Mobile is planning, how it will be structured, or how it will be priced. Meanwhile, it seems that T-Mobile is also considering another potential content move. And this one we can actually see and evaluate.Admittedly this doesn’t merit much notice at first glance. T-Mobile runs promos every week, and after a while the free stuff they give out expires or runs its course. So a giveaway is expiring. So what?However, T-Mobile may have been doing more than just leaping at opportunity when it cut its deal with a struggling Pandora. It appears to have adopted a conscious decision to target music periodically in its Tuesday giveaways, and to do so in a rather more comprehensive manner than its occasional movie giveaways. The trend first began in March, when T-Mobile offered one free month of Slackr Radio’s ad-free option as part of T-Mobile Tuesdays. Then in June, T-Mobile offered two free months of Amazon’s (AMZN) Music Unlimited - along with a $4 movie ticket for Wonder Woman, hands down the most successful movie it has partnered with to date. And finally it offered three free months of Pandora Premium. Altogether, in mid-December with the free Pandora expiring, T-Mobile has covered six of the last nine months worth of premium music subscription costs for its customers. No word yet on what comes next, but it wouldn’t surprise me if they run another promotion soon.Assuming that T-Mobile is adopting a persistent approach to music, why would it be doing so? What is it about music that makes T-Mobile want to make sure its customers don’t go too long without it? Premium music services actually have a couple of beneficial attributes from a wireless carrier’s perspective. First, it is a downloadable content service. This has been something of a pet peeve of mine for a while, as any of my followers well know. Wireless carriers benefit immensely from the penetration of downloadable content because it reduces peak usage on their networks, which is the key driver of their capital spending needs. While not all Pandora Premium users will download, downloads are not even an option on regular, ad-supported Pandora, so anything that converts users of Pandora’s free service - still the largest digital music service in the US - into Premium users can only have a beneficial impact.That’s almost certainly just a side benefit, however, especially since T-Mobile could not be sure how many people would take advantage of Pandora’s download option, and music only accounts for about 10% of network traffic, far below video’s 60%. Probably more significant is what this means for T-Mobile’s future as a content platform, and by extension other wireless carrier’s prospects in the same vein. Less than two months removed from T-Mobile’s latest Un-Carrier move to incorporate free Netflix (NFLX) into every family wireless plan, it appears to be seriously experimenting with another complimentary content offer for subscribers.Premium music services go for around $10 per month, so they are in the same pricing neighborhood as streaming video services - Netflix charges $11, Hulu $8-$12, and Amazon $8-$11 - and would presumably require similar financial outflows to sustain over the long-term. It is unlikely T-Mobile wants another outlay that large as a recurring expense. It only charges $40 a month per line for four lines, with tax included. At the same time, subscription premium music services are growing very strongly, and customers seem to value them highly. In fact, there are currently about as many premium music subscriptions in Apple (AAPL) and Spotify (MUSIC) as there are Netflix subscriptions worldwide. So customers value this and T-Mobile could probably attract quite a few of them. If it could find a more affordable way of paying for them.T-Mobile’s Tuesdays experiments therefore seem to me to be more than just another giveaway. Rather, T-Mobile appears to be trying to coax music services into a sort of “internal market” for music services on the T-Mobile platform. T-Mobile would offer consumers a menu of several premium music services, each of which would agree to charge considerably less than its headline rate for T-Mobile customers. T-Mobile might pick a winner each month or quarter, or it might simply let each customer pick for themselves from whoever qualified to be included.There may be considerably broader scope for this with music than with video. Streaming video services are not very fungible, since each has exclusive content agreements that the others don’t have. AT&T’s (T) HBO offer, for example, has a fundamentally different value proposition to consumers than T-Mobile’s Netflix offer. One is of no help to those who want Game of Thrones, the other is no good for those who prefer to watch Orange is the New Black. But music services all make agreements with the same music rights holders, charge about the same price, and offer about the same services and features. This has allowed T-Mobile to spend the last nine months playing various services off against one another as they jockey for position in the increasingly crowded premium music space. The customers may not be 100% indifferent between them, but they are sufficiently similar that if one offers considerable cost savings over the other they are more likely to be willing to switch.Switching music services is still not hassle free, of course. It requires starting over with regard to playlists, user data, interface familiarity, etc. But as I said, for a substantial savings many customers would still be tempted. Assuming T-Mobile could produce such an “internal market,” it might be able to exert sufficient downward pressure on pricing to make the giveaway more affordable. Essentially, music services would have to “bid” for T-Mobile’s customers. Amazon already offers a 20% discount to Prime members for Amazon Music Unlimited, and then it offers a $20 discount on top of that for those who prepay for a year. It is well-suited to such a price war if it starts. Pandora, Apple and Spotify haven't yet matched those offers and, for Apple, perhaps it would have no interest in doing so since the primary purpose of Apple Music is to sell iPhones, not music subscriptions.Pandora and Spotify, however, might have a considerably harder time staying out of the fray. Especially if, like Slackr, T-Mobile also dallied with smaller operators trying to get off the ground who could use a couple million subscribers as a launchpad. It seems quite feasible that T-Mobile could get a three- or four-way price war going, and fashion for itself a new cudgel to use against AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) in the wireless wars, which I still think are only in a temporary lull, not a permanent ceasefire. And at considerably less cost than what it cost it to bring Netflix on board.Music is not going to single-handedly vault T-Mobile into the lead over Verizon and AT&T, but the popularity of such services and the fact that everyone is moving to bundle content and wireless in this way suggests it would be a potent weapon, in combination with other existing T-Mobile services. AT&T and Verizon would probably have to respond. At first, they would probably bleed some subscribers to T-Mobile. Then, they would eventually be pushed to respond, as happened with unlimited data and optimized video streaming. The end result would be a shift of some number of subscribers away from the Big Two to T-Mobile, followed by a revenue decline/cost increase of supplying free music at all three carriers.The implications for the different music services of such a price war are a little more varied. In my opinion, Spotify, not Pandora, is the big loser, despite the latter’s ongoing difficulties in the market right now. Spotify, like Pandora, is burning large amounts of cash, and unlike Pandora premium subscriptions are its main product, the product it is counting on to produce meaningful cash flow. While Pandora could continue to use its industry-leading advertising engine to supplement its income, pricing pressure on subscriptions threatens to erode Spotify’s margins far more severely, since that is where all its profits come from.T-Mobile may already be sitting on another content weapon in the wireless wars, even before it makes the jump to TV. And unlike a TV service that may or may not appeal to customers already drowning in high-priced pay-TV offers, this appears to be something that customers really want. And would therefore value more highly any wireless carrier who offered it to them. We won’t know how adding Netflix impacted T-Mobile subscriptions until next month when it reports results, and without that data its a little speculative to say how big the impact of a free music service would be. But assuming that eventually everyone moved to match it, the end result would likely be very good for consumers, but see music services and wireless providers splitting the hit to their own bottom lines as $10 a month disappeared from their combined incomes.I see the wireless sector as remaining intensely competitive, and the cease-fire of recent months as only temporary. I believe that wireless competitive pressure remains intense and that adjoining industry sectors, like TV and music, will also continue to feel downward pricing pressure.As I’ve noted before, I consider Pandora to be a buy. It has made a few missteps, but the market has punished it overly severely for them and is now valuing them at little more than the cash they carry on their balance sheet, despite continuing to grow revenues. I consider Verizon a hold, as the stronger of the Big Two, and AT&T a sell because of its outsized exposure to Pay-TV. I have also called Apple a hold, since its stock run-up has removed a large share of the discount its shares were trading at. I am long on Amazon, as I believe its future profit potential remains under-appreciated.As for T-Mobile itself, I have long been worried it lacks the spectrum position to carry the heavy network loads it invites consumers to place on it, but recent moves to make network management more flexible and continuing success in raising capacity have me reconsidering that position somewhat. For now, I remain a hold on T-Mobile, rather than a buy. But my optimism is slowly growing."
4115836,92586,2017-10-24T12:50:15-04:00,"T-Mobile continues to outperform the U.S.-based peer group on retail postpaid net adds by quite a bit.I believe T-Mobile's EPS beat was driven by the relatively strong gross margins, a rarity in the telecom space.I wonder if now may be a good time to jump in and partake in one of the few growth stories in the telecom world.","CEO John Legere and team have delivered another signature ""beat and raise"".Before the opening bell on Monday, T-Mobile US (TMUS) reported revenues of $10.0 billion that were an inch above expectations, but represented the company's slowest YOY top-line growth since 4Q15. EPS of $0.63 topped estimates by a healthy 17 cents, as margins remained resilient relative to the headwinds faced by peers lately.Credit: The VergeTop-line strength could be observed across the board, with branded postpaid revenues up YOY in the mid-single digits and the rest of the business (i.e. other services and equipment) up about +10%. As the graph below illustrates, T-Mobile continues to outperform the U.S.-based peer group on retail postpaid net adds, having raked in nearly twice as many accounts as runner-up Verizon (VZ) since the beginning of 2016 and without showing signs of giving its competitors much room to breathe. Postpaid churn ticked up sequentially to 1.23%, but fell below year-ago levels of 1.32% in what I believe to have been decent operational results. I estimate that 29 cents of T-Mobile's sizable 35-cent non-GAAP YOY improvement came from revenue growth, with the services side of the business accounting for virtually all of the upside.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsThe rest of the net earnings increase came largely on the back of improved gross margins: 58.0% vs. last year's 57.3%, aided by improved profitability metrics in equipment. Although the 69-bp YOY total company margin expansion may seem unimpressive to the more demanding investor, it cuts against the grain given sector-wide pricing pressures and increased network costs associated with the new unlimited data plans introduced by all major U.S. carriers in 2017. Case in point: Verizon's 3Q17 service margins came in -180 bps softer as compared with 3Q16, and I expect AT&T (T) to follow suit. I believe T-Mobile's EPS beat was driven precisely by these relatively strong margins, which is great news for investors who were skeptical about what increased competitive challenges could mean for the company's bottom line this year.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from T-Mobile's filingsElsewhere, opex remained under check: flat YOY despite the +8% top line increase and allowing the company to produce operating leverage. Effective tax rate moved up, but not enough to cause any meaningful impact to net income. The company also increase guidance on postpaid net adds and adjusted EBITDA for the full year, which I believe helped to send the stock up about +2% during yesterday's trading session.Earlier this year, I issued a mildly optimistic but cautious statement about TMUS as a result of ""the potential price and market share wars and the rich valuations"". About 10 months later, I notice that T-Mobile has been weathering the storm better than its key peers. While I don't expect the competitive pressures to subside, the ""Uncarrier"" has been proving that it can deal with the challenges fairly well.TMUS PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsWith the stock valued at 25.7x forward earnings that might be justified by the rich +19% expected EPS growth in the long term, I start to see the appeal of TMUS with fewer restrictions. As the stock's P/E multiple has come down about five turns from the low 30s of June, I wonder if now may be a good time to jump in and partake in one of the few growth stories in the telecom world.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow DM Martins Research.

4108421,95916,2017-09-20T17:40:39-04:00,"T-Mobile's new network prioritization threshold is a remarkable feat of engineering that should attract more customers to the company.De-prioritization is not a silver bullet and should not be confused with network quality improvements, which remain key for wireless companies.T-Mobile has also granted itself more flexibility to be less generous going forward.This will help T-Mobile prepare for future network challenges and preserve network quality.But it may also be a sign it knows such challenges are close at hand.","Lately, I have been hedging on T-Mobile (TMUS) somewhat, saying that if its network quality stayed high it was going to be an outstanding wireless carrier without ever really committing to the idea that network quality would remain high. T-Mobile has continued to defy my predictions and make outstanding network quality announcements, but I’ve never quite been able to believe they could really keep this up.It’s latest news changes my views on the network, but only partially. So I’m still hedging. But I’m starting to come around.T-Mobile continues to prove me, and a lot of others, wrong. While a lot of commentary lately has focused on the prospects for a Sprint (S) merger, T-Mobile’s more meaningful numbers continue to be the performance of its network, the only real risk factor in an otherwise sterling stock.And T-Mobile has some more news to show just how unconcerned it is about potential network pressures. Starting today, T-Mobile has raised the prioritization threshold, the trigger for throttling of data speeds on congested towers, from 32 GB to 50 GB, a mammoth increase.To really put that number in perspective, there are two things to consider. The first is a simple industry comparison. AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) both have similar prioritization thresholds at 22 GB, Sprint is barely higher at 23 GB. T-Mobile was already the market leader and had no reason to fear being outmatched, but it has gone ahead and raised the threshold anyway.The other thing that might help put the scale of this announcement in context is the history of T-Mobile’s own former levels. By FCC rule, prioritization thresholds have to be publicly disclosed to customers as part of their customer agreement. You have to really dig on T-Mobile’s website, but it's a publicly available piece of information. (You click “About”, by scrolling to the very bottom of the site, then click “Consumer Information” and then click the “Internet Services” tab that almost fades into the background at the top.)According to T-Mobile, the end of 2016 quarterly data had the 3% cutoff mark at 28 GB per month. That was up from 21 GB per month in June 2015 when the throttling policy was first implemented, and 23 GB per month in October 2015 when Binge On was announced. Those numbers, in turn, reflect increases from 17 GB at the end of 2014, indicating a steady 2 GB per quarter progression. The cap held almost steady for about six months after that.But in the third quarter of 2016 it went from 24 GB to 26 GB, and in the fourth quarter, it was up to 28 GB, signaling a renewed 2 GB/quarter growth rate. Since then, growth has held steady once more, with 30 GB being the threshold in Q1 of 2017. T-Mobile then announced that the cap rose again to 32GB last quarter.This might give you a better sense of just how remarkable T-Mobile’s latest move is. From 2 GB per quarter on what was already the most generous unlimited data network, it has hiked the threshold nine times the standard amount.I have often said I see network quality as T-Mobile’s one potential weakness, precisely because it is so generous with data. Commentators would often respond that I didn’t understand that T-Mobile would simply throttle - sorry, de-prioritize - exceptionally heavy users and therefore the network would never fail. I am perfectly aware of prioritization protocols - I've written about them before here - but I also do not see de-prioritization as some sort of silver bullet.First, customers tend to notice when their data speeds slow, and so any company promising data-heavy features like free video streaming or unlimited data needs to be good enough at network management to deliver those features without compromising network quality. When it fails, it has to slow speeds for customers, and those customers tend to leave. Whether it allows such slow speeds to happen naturally via congestion or imposes them itself via de-prioritization isn’t necessarily material. Either means slower speeds for at least some customers, who decamp to another network.So investors should not confuse widespread de-prioritization, which is a strategy for managing the failure of network quality, with true quality boosting enhancements to the network that allow it to offer better service to all customers.But secondly, T-Mobile’s thresholds also weren’t derived randomly. They weren’t even judgement calls. Rather, they were the product of a rigid formula which set prioritization at the 97th percentile of the customer base. In other words, no more than 3% of customers were ever de-prioritized. My concern always was that if 4% or more of T-Mobile’s customers started using a lot more data, it would start to affect the network.That brings me to the one asterisk to this great news for customers: the strict guarantee for the 97% has been abandoned. While T-Mobile’s prior numbers were always pegged to the third percentile of heavy users, the new number appears to be more of a judgement call. T-Mobile’s website no longer references 3% in its legal, technical jargon, and what’s more, it does not disclose exactly how the new number was arrived at. A blog entry announcement by CTO Neville Ray is much the same, saying that 50 GB is “basically” 1% of users, but giving no indication that that is the metric used to derive the number.Going forward, it appears, T-Mobile is simply going to set the threshold where it thinks is best.This is less transparent, but also more flexible. And it goes at least some way towards addressing some of my network concerns since T-Mobile now can potentially “manage” the data drains of more than 3% of the customer base if that proves necessary.As I’ve said, that isn’t a perfect solution, either, since it's likely to drive those customers away if it happens consistently. My preferred solution, and I’m sure T-Mobile’s as well, is to continue to make network management breakthroughs that keep data speeds humming for everyone.Nevertheless, the ability to manage the network more flexibly at some point if needed will help to preserve network quality for the vast majority of users, allowing T-Mobile to slow future hikes in the threshold if necessary to preserve quality for the vast majority of users.If there is one downside to this for investors, it might be simply that T-Mobile feels it needs that flexibility. While I have come around at least partially to management’s view that T-Mobile’s network is “Data Strong” and will come out the other side, management might also be starting to come around at least a little to mine and see some potential challenges ahead.But that is hypothetical on my part, as all of my network predictions have been. All we really see at the moment is that T-Mobile remains confident in its network at the moment, and feels comfortable offering customers what is hands down the biggest hike in un-throttled data speeds since the iPhone came out.I continue to believe Sprint’s hoard of spectrum is the best bet of all in wireless, although T-Mobile may be about to buy it at a discount if rumors are to be believed. But T-Mobile is certainly another strong contender for investors dollars, especially after today’s announcement, especially after the profit growth it has shown over the past six months.I am most bearish of all on AT&T, which is exposed to declines in traditional pay-TV as well as wireless margin pressures. And Verizon’s high payout ratio leaves me concerned there as well, although its best-in-class network has got to count for something.Altogether, I see Sprint as the best bet, but T-Mobile is a strong second choice and for those who don’t believe spectrum outweighs subscribers, perhaps even the first choice in wireless for investors.De-prioritization is not network management, and a company having a de-prioritization plan does not mean that their customers will not notice a decline in network quality. However, T-Mobile's changes to the current threshold and how it calculates future thresholds are both bullish for the stock in my view. While I would still be reluctant to abandon a Sprint position for a T-Mobile position, those who are long T-Mobile should definitely feel better about their investment after today's announcement."
4111956,25120,2017-10-05T14:59:46-04:00,"The rationale behind a merger of T-Mobile US and Sprint continues to make sense.While talks about a deal structure and FCC approval might be difficult, the potential rewards are certainly worthwhile.Further upside might be within reach as the pie for both companies will become much larger, as T-Mobile has time working in its favour, thanks to continued market share gains.","T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) are in merger talks, that is clear. What is not clear is if regulators are willing to approve the merger, and what the exchange ratio for the stock can be, and how the deal would be structured.It seems that T-Mobile´s investors are held back by the high valuation of Sprint in relation to its contribution, especially as it operates with so much leverage. While valuation multiples are fairly similar, it is clear that T-Mobile is more profitable (on the bottom line) than Sprint and is contributing growth. Sprint offers a great network, scale and tax assets as discussions about a deal structure will probably take time, if the FCC even approves it.Nonetheless, while talks are difficult they are worthwhile. Synergies, in terms of capital spending and costs savings, can be very substantial and enlarge the pie for both groups of equity investors in a big way.T-Mobile is a clear winner in the US mobile market. While it is still far smaller than Verizon and AT&T, it is gaining customers at a rapid pace, reinforcing its position as the third player in the market.The company has roughly 70 million customers and has been growing the customer count by +1 million for 17 quarters in a row. In the first half of the year, the company posted service revenues of $14.8 billion, for a growth of 10%. The company posted adjusted EBITDA of $5.7 billion, as margins of 38.4% are high in absolute terms, but are low versus peers. T-Mobile US operates with a $28.3 billion net debt position, for a 2.6 times leverage ratio.The 831 million shares trade at $61, which values equity a $51 billion. Including debt, T-Mobile US is valued at $79 billion, equivalent to 2.7 times annualized revenues and 6.8 times adjusted EBITDA.It is safe to say that T-Mobile is the stronger partner of the two in a potential deal. Sprint has little over 53 million customers but unlike T-Mobile. Not only is the customer base about a quarter smaller, the customer count is stable and does not show any sustained growth.Service revenues came in at $12.2 billion in the first half of this year which is rather flattish compared to last year, although ARPU (average revenues per user) surpasses that of T-Mobile. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $5.5 billion, as margins of 45% are superior compared to T-Mobile. So far the good news, as Sprint carries quite a high valuation.The company operates with 4.1 billion shares outstanding, for a +$30 billion equity valuation at $7.50 per share. While that seems reasonable, the company torches along $32.8 billion in net debt, for a 3 times leverage ratio. The overall valuation of $63 billion values the business at 2.6 times sales and 5.7 times adjusted EBITDA.It is safe to say that revenue multiples are similar between both companies. On the one hand, T-Mobile offers growth and lower depreciation charges, for better profits on the bottom line. At the same time, Sprint offers better EBITDA margins but suffers from higher D&A charges in part the result of higher depreciation charges on the leased devices.The combined business is on track to post annualized service revenues of $55 billion, so even small reductions in costs in terms of percentage of revenues has a huge impact. Sprint´s network is widely recognised as being of high quality and a merger could not just deliver cost savings but capital spending synergies as well. The quality of the network is a reason why investors have been adding a ¨premium¨ to Sprint´s shares despite sub-optimal, or lack of profits. Of course, Sprint has reported huge losses in the past which gives the combination access to large tax savings in the future, provided that the deal is structured in a right way.In a sense, Sprint is more eager to do a deal as it posts very modest earnings and is not growing that much despite some recent momentum, while T-Mobile continues to gain market share. T-Mobile, on the other side, needs larger capital spending but is growing at a relatively good clip, which gives it viability to operate as a stand-alone business going forwards. Even if growth can be continued it is a daunting task to gain the no. 2 position in the market in an organic manner.If the combined company could deliver upon 3-5% synergies in terms of service revenues, these synergies would amount to roughly $1.5-$2.5 billion a year. At the midpoint of $2 billion, and after applying a market multiple of 6-7 times EBITDA, some $12-$14 billion in value could be created. That is substantial given that the combined equity valuation of T-Mobile and Sprint today is equivalent to $80 billion.Other synergies come from capital spending. Verizon, for example, invests roughly $17 billion on both the wireless and wireline business. Most of these investments go into the wireless business which has 150 million subscribers. As the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint has 123 million subscribers, it seems safe to say that the combination should be able to live on capital spending of $13 billion a year or less. Sprint invested $4 billion last year, but that was down from $6-$7 billion in recent years as it has spare capacity on its current network.Capital spending of T-Mobile US comes in around $7-8 billion, as real synergies could be delivered upon. With combined capital spending coming in around $13-14 billion, it seems reasonable to say that $2 billion a year could be saved for quite a few years to come. That could perhaps save another $10 billion in capital spending in the coming years, favouring investors.Capital spending synergies and costs synergies might amount to $20-25 billion in terms of value, equivalent to 25-30% accretion on top of the combined equity valuation of $80 billion as of today. At the same time, improved earnings and lower capital spending automatically improve leverage ratio´s, certainly if a deal would be structured in stock only.Betting on this deal is a bet on the FCC as it seems safe to say that both firms are eager to merge their operations with each other. The upside is very compelling and while it can be argued that T-Mobile might be undervalued as it outperforms Sprint, both firms benefit from the very large synergies and excess capacity in Sprint´s network and the tax shield provided by operating losses being recorded in the past.Adding it all together, the exact composition of a $80 billion current equity valuation pie can be debated. At current levels, little over 60% is reserved for T-Mobile based on the market prices as every 1 percent change in the exchange ratio has a real impact on the deal and shareholders. A 65% exchange ratio has a $4 billion impact for both groups of shareholders, but agreements must be reached to unlock combined value accretion, pegged at $20-$25 billion in the discussion above. As a result, management of both firms should present their case and fight for it, yet agreement might matter more than price as long as it is roughly fair.Time will tell and it is hard to say how much of the merger is priced in at the moment, nor what number/valuation is attached to the merger case if it ever gets approved. The time seems ripe this time and could benefit all parties involved, but for now, it remains an uncertain waiting game for all investors."
4110765,102644,2017-09-29T16:59:00-04:00,"Contrary to consensus opinion, we believe that regulators should welcome a merger between T-Mobile US and Sprint.We identify four major structural changes in the wireless industry in recent years that have substantially increased competition in US wireless and make consumer harm unlikely.A merger has the potential to substantially benefit consumers by increasing competition in the pay television and broadband internet markets.In the spirit of John Maynard Keynes – “when the facts change, regulators should change their mind.""","In light of the recent news and speculation around renewed merger talks between T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S), we have read a lot of discussion about the regulatory risk with such a transaction. It seems that a majority of observers believe a deal will be hard to get done. At first blush, this is understandable. After all, regulators blocked the 2011 merger attempt between AT&T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and the 2014 merger attempt between T-Mobile US and Sprint, both times for the same reason. They wanted to preserve the status quo of four national competitors rather than see a decline to three national competitors.There was a time when there was a sound industrial logic behind these regulator objections. Reducing four competitors to three might have led to price increases and hurt consumers if it had happened 10 years ago. We believe, however, that the facts today no longer support these objections. Below, we will identify four structural changes in the wireless industry that have substantially increased competition in recent years. We note that a lot of these changes came into full effect after regulators rebuffed the previous merger attempt and are still ongoing today.In our view, the facts suggest that the US wireless industry would be more competitive with three national players today than it was with four national players as recently as five years ago. Moreover, as we will discuss below, it seems unlikely that consumer prices will increase as a result of this merger. So, in the spirit of John Maynard Keynes, “when the facts change, regulators should change their mind.”We go one step further, and argue that a T-Mobile US – Sprint merger has the potential to deliver significant benefits to consumers by increasing competition in several adjacent markets, specifically in the pay television and broadband internet markets. Unlike wireless services pricing, which has been in a steep and accelerating decline in the last decade, pricing for traditional television bundles has increased faster than the overall rate of CPI inflation. And, on the broadband internet side, many households in America today have only one or two options for broadband internet access. We explain why a merged T-Mobile US – Sprint would be in a superior position to disrupt these less competitive markets and, ultimately, lower prices for consumers.Thus, while we do not believe meaningful consumer negatives are likely in the wireless market, we see the potential for significant consumer benefits in the pay television and broadband internet markets. The lines between internet access services (of all kinds), telephony services, and media/content services have been blurring for some time, and there is a distinct trend towards converged offerings of all of these services. When viewed in the context of a broader market definition encompassing all these services, we believe it is difficult to escape the conclusion that a merger between T-Mobile US and Sprint will increase competition and benefit consumers.In other words, when viewed in a more appropriate, broader context, regulators might welcome a deal, rather than block it.We begin with a high level view of historical CPI inflation in the US wireless market compared to the overall CPI and the CPI for pay television and internet services. We begin the comparison in June 2007, when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the original iPhone, marking, in our view, the beginning of the modern wireless era.Source: Bureau of Labor StatisticsSeveral points stand out. First off, wireless services are the only category for which prices have actually declined in the last decade. In fact, the decline has been a rather substantial 26%. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, there has been a marked acceleration in price declines recently. The recent declines have been so rapid that the Federal Reserve called them out repeatedly as a reason for overall inflation missing their targets, for instance, in the minutes of the June FOMC meeting.We believe that this acceleration in price declines is not an accident, but rather the result of at least four powerful structural changes in the US wireless business in the last decade:The first two points are particularly powerful, but do not take it from us, take it from Craig Moffett, the star analyst and founding partner of MoffettNathanson, who explained them very clearly in a recent interview with Bloomberg.Simply put, it used to be that the different wireless providers in the US were not really perfect substitutes for one another. AT&T carried the iPhone exclusively from 2007 to 2010, and Verizon (VZ) long had the well-deserved reputation of having the best network. If you were a die-hard Apple fan, you had to be with AT&T. If you wanted the best network, you had to be with Verizon. The only reason to go with either T-Mobile or Sprint was to get a lower price. And, to get that lower price, many customers would have had to accept far inferior service, as network quality at T-Mobile or Sprint used to be far worse than Verizon or AT&T. To many of the industry’s best customers, it was an unacceptable trade-off, almost irrespective of price.As a result, AT&T and Verizon largely split the industry’s best customers between them. Even though there were technically four national wireless competitors, the effective number of competitors for the best customers was really one or two. This is why we think it is fair to characterize the US wireless market between 2007 and 2010 as an effective duopoly. Ironically, even this rather cozy duopoly structure did not result in an increase in pricing, with the wireless services CPI flat to declining.This industry structure first started to erode on February 10, 2011, when Verizon launched the iPhone. We do not think it is an accident that the first significant decline in wireless pricing (outside the financial crisis) occurred in late 2010, in preparation for the end of AT&T’s iPhone exclusivity. After all, AT&T had a tremendous incentive to lock in iPhone customers ahead of new competition from Verizon.Sprint followed suit and launched the iPhone on October 14, 2011. Stunningly, it took T-Mobile until April 12, 2013, to offer the iPhone, apparently because Apple considered T-Mobile’s network too inferior prior to the rollout of LTE, as T-Mobile US CEO John Legere explained at Deutsche Telekom’s 2015 capital markets day:This comment also highlights the stunning turnaround in T-Mobile’s network quality. Less than five years ago, Apple apparently considered it too inferior to carry the iPhone. Today, T-Mobile’s coverage is almost on par with Verizon, and T-Mobile is widely recognized as the fastest wireless network in the US. In fact, for a large fraction of the US population, T-Mobile is objectively the best network available today, and the differences between AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile are small enough that all are legitimate substitutes for one another from a network perspective.Thus, even if Sprint disappeared off the face of the earth tomorrow, the other three carriers are more effective competitors today than the four carriers were as recently as 2013 (and certainly in the duopoly days of 2010), because of effective parity in their network and phone offerings. We believe that this is a large part of the reason that price declines in US wireless accelerated in recent years.More importantly, from regulators’ perspective, if you reduced the number of competitors from four to three today, we believe the industry almost would certainly remain more competitive than it was in 2007–2012, a period where wireless pricing declined on an absolute basis, even while overall CPI was rising. So, when we hear people state that a T-Mobile – Sprint merger would lead to higher prices for consumers, we wonder how they reach that conclusion.But the pace of change in the wireless industry did not stop after 2013. We see at least two additional changes in the industry structure that further contribute to increased competitiveness.The more important one is the end of two-year contracts, which began with the launch of T-Mobile’s Uncarrier strategy on March 26, 2013. For those who followed the wireless industry back in the dark ages of 2003, you will remember that two-year contracts were then the industry’s ingenious answer to FCC-mandated number portability. Recall that prior to November 2003 you could not take your phone number with you when switching carriers, providing a huge barrier to switching. So, operators introduced two-year contracts as a new way to lock in customers and reduce churn.Predictably, the industry initially resisted the Uncarrier move, given the possible increases in churn and overall competitiveness. In fact, when regulators reportedly dissuaded T-Mobile and Sprint from merging in 2014, none of the other carriers had followed suit. But this began to change on August 13, 2015, when Verizon announced the end of two-year contracts. AT&T and Sprint finally ended contracts on January 8, 2016.It should be clear that this is a step change higher for competition in the wireless industry. Previously, when one competitor had a superior offer, many customers were unable to take advantage because they were locked into a long-term contract with an existing provider. And, as a result it should be unsurprising that the largest pricing declines on record occurred after the end of two-year contracts. More importantly, it suggests that future price increases are even less likely than based on our initial argument of phone and network parity alone.The final and most recent industry change occurred this year with the move to unlimited plans, which was again driven by T-Mobile. The reason this matters is that it makes the different carriers’ service plans even more interchangeable. While carriers previously segmented their customer bases with different rate plans, it has now become easier for consumers to make an apples-to-apples comparison between different carriers. Greater transparency in pricing should further increase competitiveness and has already allowed millions of consumers to benefit from lower pricing compared to the previous bucketed data plans. To be clear, we do not expect the huge price declines from early 2017 to repeat, but we believe unlimited plans make it even harder for wireless companies to raise prices in the future.In summary, we believe that the US wireless industry structure is the most competitive ever today. Moreover, we believe it would remain more competitive than in the 2007 – 2012 period of declining wireless prices even if the number of competitors went from four to three as a result of a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint.So, we strongly agree with the FCC’s conclusion this week that there is effective competition in the mobile wireless industry, and with FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s statement that “most reasonable people see a fiercely competitive marketplace.”The previous section discussed why we do not believe that consumers will be harmed by a merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. In this section, we will highlight why consumers could actually benefit from increased competition in adjacent markets, in particular the pay-TV and broadband internet markets.Pay-TV is a fascinating market that is undergoing a tremendous amount of change as we speak. Cord cutting, the emergence of over-the-top streaming platforms, and the sustainability of the traditional linear cable TV bundle are frequent and important topics of discussion. We believe that the root cause of this disruption lies in the inflation chart we showed earlier in this article. Pay television bundles have experienced significantly greater price inflation than other telecom and media services, making them expensive, particularly compared to many emerging alternatives.Think of the value of a Netflix (NFLX) subscription at $10/month compared to the cost of a traditional cable bundle, especially for a household that is not interested in sports programming. But in a great example of the disruption that T-Mobile has already brought to this market, T-Mobile customers now get Netflix free. Similarly, Amazon Prime customers receive free Prime video, and there is abundant free video content available on online platforms lead by YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Obviously, this price discrepancy is making the traditional cable bundle vulnerable to disruption, and the way people consume and pay for video content is changing. Most likely people will continue to consume ever-increasing amounts of video content, and we believe that they are willing to pay for things they like. But the days of paying significant amounts for content you do not watch will likely come to an end sooner rather than later. Consumers are looking for new, cheaper choices.It is difficult to impossible to predict exactly how this will play out in the coming years, but we are confident in that the critical disruptors in this ecosystem will share two characteristics – scale and the absence of a legacy business that would be wrecked by disruption. Both of these suggest strongly that a merged T-Mobile – Sprint would be an important disruptor in the pay-TV business in the future, with “Netflix on Us” representing just the tip of the iceberg.To understand why scale and the absence of a legacy business matter, consider Netflix. Netflix has changed the game in the content business by being willing to spend multiples of its media competitors’ content budget to deliver a service with scale. It is the perfect “flywheel” – more content attracts more customers, revenue from whom drives further increases in content investment. So, clearly scale matters. Buy why, you may ask, did none of the traditional media companies follow this play book? We believe the answer is simple – they make too much money from the status quo of the cable TV bundle. This is not necessarily a criticism of the media CEOs. Ask yourself this – would their shareholders tolerate foregoing profits and dividends derived from their existing businesses to pursue increased investment and a new business strategy? Disruption is far easier when you are disrupting someone else’s business than your own.These same arguments suggest that a combined T-Mobile – Sprint could be a prime disruptor on the distribution side. With no existing TV business to protect, the combined company would be in a superior position to deliver new choices to consumers, building on “Netflix on Us.” And, with the increasing scale of the combined company, they would be large enough to do transformative deals with content owners. After all, the combined company would have many more subscribers than even the largest video distributors today. While T-Mobile is likely to pursue this strategy on its own, there is no doubt that the increased scale resulting from a merger has the potential to significantly enhance the company’s position and accelerate disruption for the benefit of consumers.The broadband internet market is a longer-term, but potentially even more interesting and disruptive story. Most may not realize that T-Mobile is actually in this market already today, albeit in a tiny way. Subscribers to the company’s most expensive rate plan T-Mobile ONE Plus International, which costs an additional $25/month/line, offers unlimited 4G LTE mobile hotspot data. So, conceivably, a subscriber could “cut the cord” of traditional wired broadband today and receive all their internet service over a T-Mobile LTE hotspot for only $25/month.Of course, few people would actually want to do so currently. Wired broadband via cable or fiber is a superior service today due to its greater speed and reliability. That could change in a few years, however, when the US wireless industry converts to 5G, which by all accounts will represent a transformational change in wireless network capacity. In fact, Verizon already has made it clear that it views 5G, not fiber to the home, as the preferred last mile solution for broadband in the future. Lowell McAdam, Verizon’s CEO, discussed this earlier this month at Goldman Sachs’s Communacopia conference with analyst Brett Feldman:So, what he appears to be saying is that 5G will offer sufficient capacity to deliver broadband to customers’ homes. Rather than have expensive truck rolls to install fiber in customers’ homes one by one (the old FiOS way), he apparently intends to run fiber to the neighborhood to support a dense 5G network and mail customers a 5G router.If 5G is able to deliver on that promise, this solution could be an order of magnitude cheaper than existing cable or fiber solutions, both on a capex and on an opex basis (no more service calls and technicians running wires in customers’ homes). And, he is in a position to know more about the technology and the economics of both alternatives than almost anyone else. After all, Verizon connected fiber to millions of homes for its FiOS service, still runs the largest wireless network in the US and is probably the single largest owner of fiber backhaul systems in the world.The consequences for the incumbent broadband players could be nothing short of earth shattering. Most consumers today can only buy wireline broadband internet access from one or two companies. Suddenly, wireless companies with sufficient spectrum and a dense enough network could compete with an offering of comparable speed and reliability to wireline broadband.But spectrum and network density are obviously the crux of the issue, as they are the two biggest constraints on wireless companies’ ability to provide comparably fast, reliable service. In-home data consumption can be orders of magnitude higher than data consumption on a cell phone (think of all the devices on your home Wi-Fi network, streaming in 4K to multiple TVs, …), so it will require orders of magnitude greater network capacity and investment than today’s wireless networks. Verizon’s solution appears to be deploying the millimeter wave spectrum acquired from Straight Path, combined with an unprecedented investment in fiber, including a purchase commitment to Corning to “buy enough fiber to string to Mars.”On their own, we find it difficult to believe that either T-Mobile or Sprint would have the spectrum or the capital resources to compete in this business at scale. But combined, they would own a larger position in low and mid band spectrum than AT&T and Verizon put together. Moreover, they would have the scale and cash flows required for an investment in a densified 5G network.So, we believe that allowing a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint could create a formidable new competitor in the broadband internet market in the next decade. Suddenly broadband internet could go from having one or two competitors in a typical home to having three or four (with the addition of Verizon and a merged T-Mobile – Sprint).We conclude this section by reiterating why we see a combined T-Mobile – Sprint as the prime potential disruptor in both aforementioned markets. The combined company would be the only one in the competitive set with no incumbent TV or broadband business to protect (unlike all other cable, satellite, and telecom companies). When you have no existing cash flows to lose, it is easy to do the disruptive things that benefit customers but might otherwise wreck your existing business. This aligns T-Mobile’s interests uniquely with consumers, because delighting consumers allows them to take share from competitors, and drive pure revenue and cash flow upside.Moreover, T-Mobile already has built a significant track record of disruption with 14 Uncarrier moves and counting. And, the company has done so while delivering strong growth in revenues and cash flows, even while being the primary driver of significantly lower prices for consumers in the wireless business.Ask yourself this – which of the following seems more likely following a potential T-Mobile – Sprint merger? That John Legere would suddenly turn around, abandon the highly successful Uncarrier strategy and raise prices on consumers, or that he would use the increased scale and synergies of the combined entity to further accelerate his Uncarrier strategy, delighting customers, and thereby take additional market share from incumbents? We think the answer is obviously and emphatically the latter.Personally, even though we cannot predict exactly how all of this will unfold, we are excited to see the things that John Legere and team could deliver for both customers and shareholders armed with the increased scale resulting from a merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.Author’s Note: If you find this article helpful, and would like to receive future articles and updates, please consider clicking the “Follow” button at the top of this article.

4108269,21434,2017-09-20T12:15:31-04:00,"The merger rumor is making the usual rounds again.T-Mobile's CEO, arguably the stronger of the two, would allegedly take the new top spot.Pairing the two companies up still doesn't exactly solve Sprint's big debt problem (though it could move it).Sprint's spectrum trove is finally starting to matter, and T-Mobile is a proven subscriber growth machine.","Take the rumor with a big grain of salt, because we've heard it before and it ended up not being true. But, as of Tuesday, Sept. 19th, wireless service providers Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) are allegedly talking about a merger again. This marks the third time (at least) the idea has surfaced.Whether it ends up panning out or not, the notion of pairing a spectrum-rich but debt-laden Sprint with a well-run T-Mobile that's still a distant third to industry giants AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is a compelling idea. Finally, a true competitor that keeps Verizon and AT&T honest and fair with consumers could emerge.With that as the backdrop, what exactly might a united T-Mobile and Sprint look like? The numbers aren't tough to figure out, and the non-numerical facets aren't much tougher to piece together. Still, it's an exercise that could be time consuming to do even if it's worth doing. Consider this a gift -- a look at the combined income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements.The reports came from CNBC, which -- surprise, surprise -- only cited anonymous sources for rumors that T-Mobile and Sprint were mulling a team-up. Given the struggle each is facing due to their sheer lack of scale though, the idea has plenty of merit. But what exactly might a combined company look like though, fiscally? Pretty good, actually, with the real ""value add"" coming in a form that can't be quantified.The images below are simple enough; the most recent accounting statements that reflect the combination of each company's individual accounting statements. A big caveat must be dished out up-front though. That is, the paired companies would almost certainly cull overlapping expenses, and would further fuel sales growth together that wouldn't otherwise be achievable alone, collectively. Teaming up might also eliminate Sprint's perpetual jaw-dropping deals that garner new subscribers, but also prove to be expensive and short-lived.Whatever the case, they're a starting point for those looking to handicap what could become an all-new entity. And just so you know, last quarter was a relatively typical one for both organizations except for T-Mobile's cash balance -- it's usually around $6 billion. There are no other oddball numbers that skew what a united company would look like.Income StatementThe revenue level would likely hold steady, at least initially, as the combined companies figured out how to jointly steal business from the two powerhouses in the business. Costs of revenue and selling and administrative expenses would likely start to shrink almost immediately.Source: Thomson Reuters EikonThe number to watch here would be interest expenses. Presumably, T-Mobile's Chief John Legere would be more interested in paying down the net debt more than Sprint's Marcelo Claure has been, or been able to. Clearly that's been one of the biggest (if not the biggest) differentiators between Sprint and everyone else in the business --major interest expenses stemming from massive debt.For perspective, AT&T turned $39.8 billion worth of revenue last quarter into income of $3.9 billion. Verizon did $30.5 billion worth of business, generating a profit of $4.4 billion.Balance SheetAs was noted, up until last quarter T-Mobile was usually sitting on about $6 billion worth of cash. It's gone now. It made a big purchase in the quarter that's accounted for elsewhere on the balance -- it's not a concern. More important is the 800 pound gorilla in the room -- Sprint's $35 billion in long-term debt (counting its capitalized lease obligations), and a whopping $64.3 billion in long-term liabilities without a lot to show for it. Granted, T-Mobile's not exactly ship-shape by the same measure, but T-Mobile's is manageable. Sprint's has been unwieldy.Source: Thomson Reuters EikonThis is where the fireworks for any negotiation between the two companies are most likely to take shape. It's been suggested, though not widely, T-Mobile would issue debt to get a deal done, and at least seek to pay off some of Sprint's debt before opening this can of worms. That's the more rational assumption, in that T-Mobile is more credit-worthy than Sprint, though some have opined that Sprint's actually pushing the merger forward.On the other hand, lenders would clearly know the funding would be to acquire a shaky Sprint that's struggling to pay its own bills. Pairing the two companies up doesn't inherently mean the combined outfits will immediately -- if ever -- perform meaningfully better on their own. It's likely any needed borrowing to get the deal done would ultimately be backed by Sprint backer Masa Son or T-Mobile majority owner Deutsche Telekom AG (OTCMKTS:OTCQX:DTEGY), ultimately passing the risk off, assuming either of those entities are willing to accept it.Cash FlowFinally, cash flow. Again, operating cash flow for each name last quarter was pretty typical. T-Mobile's free cash flow was deep in the red only because of a big capital outlay. T-Mobile's free cash flow has been roughly a breakeven, on average, for the past couple of years. Sprint's has been hit and miss for the same time frame, though more often a miss than a hit.Source: Thomson Reuters EikonOf the three accounting statements, cash flow is the one changing the fastest for both, and changing particularly in favor of Sprint. This isn't a terribly worthy piece of information in terms of figuring out how and where the value of a merger would show up.Legere may be able to whittle down the companies' combined quarterly cost of revenue to something around $7.0 billion, and pare back the SG&A costs to something on the order of $4.4 billion, on average. Depreciation, a non-cash expense, isn't apt to change much. It remains to be seen how much -- if any -- quarterly interest expenses could be culled in light of the fact that debt will likely be taken on to effect a buyout of one by the other.While there's no way of saying with any certainty what sort of changes may be in store for the numbers, realistically speaking, Legere may be able to whittle down the companies' combined quarterly cost of revenue to something around $7.0 billion, and pare back the SG&A costs to something on the order of $4.4 billion, on average. Depreciation, a non-cash expense, isn't apt to change much.It remains to be seen how much -- if any -- quarterly interest expenses could be culled in light of the fact that debt will likely be taken on to effect a buyout of one by the other. At the very least T-Mobile would be able to secure better financing terms. That may be enough to pull the quarterly interest expense by $100 million or so... maybe.With that being said, it would be naive to suggest a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile is simply a matter of combining the books of both. Indeed, there's something noteworthy beyond the fiscal synergies that would certainly materialize if the two companies were working together rather than against one another.Chief among them, of course, is the treasure trove of spectrum that Sprint owns but can do very little with simply because it lacks capital, and lacks the means of securing it. Specifically, it's got 204 megahertz worth of spectrum -- more than any other U.S. carrier -- with a huge chunk of it in the 2.5 Ghz band that up until now hasn't done the company much good. The advent of 5G, however, will be able to make use of this bandwidth that up until now has essentially been useless.Source: SprintSome say -- including Sprint -- a realistic value for its spectrum is $40 billion, though it's worth nothing until it's usable. By 2020 when 5G connectivity is the new norm, it will matter.It will matter a great deal to T-Mobile, in fact, simply because it's got less spectrum than any other carrier, and needs some badly if it's going to fully monetize its 5G technology. T-Mobile recently reported it will have the nation's first narrowband Internet of Things network up and running by 2018. It will mean nothing, however, without the spectrum needed to power it.In the meantime, T-Mobile brings something to the table Sprint somehow just can't buy or build -- the ability to win and keep new subscribers. Though last quarter wasn't so hot for T-Mobile in that its market share slumped from 17.4% to 16.9%, up until then it had handily been able to steadily steal subscribers and market share from other providers... mainly Sprint, despite Sprint's never-ending giveaways and cut-throat pricing deals.Source: StatistaThere's not a lot uniqueness to this deal beyond that -- nothing their rivals can't mimic. Still, T-Mobile has the brains, and Sprint has the brawn. It may be overdoing it to call it a match made in Heaven, but if either is ever going to take a real shot at AT&T or Verizon, it's going to need the help of the other.It's been said before but it merits repeating now -- this is a merger that needs to happen, and the sooner the better. The longer AT&T and Verizon are allowed to enter new business lines and the longer Sprint is allowed to flounder, the more difficult it becomes to catch up with bigger players and fix what's broken at Sprint.It's also worth bearing in mind there are some real potential synergies that Sprint and T-Mobile could achieve together that wouldn't be achievable in any other combination. Significant revenue growth and respectable earnings growth are on the table above and beyond the simple addition of the accounting statements done above, IF the companies choose to be smart about tapping into that potential.A reason to buy S or TMUS? Sadly, not really, especially after Sprint shares jumped 7% on Tuesday and T-Mobile stock gained almost as much. The bulk of any likely upside is already priced in, largely because the notion of a merger of these two companies has never really gone away. Indeed, it's been being priced in for months now.On the other hand, there's a downside risk. Should this be just another rumor and not end up going anywhere, fatigued TMUS and S owners may finally throw in the towel, assuming it's never going to happen. A close-second risk is that even if the two outfits decide to team up, the ensuing debt somebody will be taking on makes it tough to justify paying a steep premium beyond either stock's current price.The bulk of any upside any trader could realistically hope for from this point is a semi-graceful exit out of a wobbly (at best) trade and/or the survival of a company they own stock in. Both stocks already pretty well reflect a fair value of what the combined companies will likely be capable of."
4106391,102413,2017-09-13T04:57:03-04:00,"T-Mobile announces its ""Netflix on us"" offer.Is this a positive for T-Mobile customers? For Netflix? For T-Mobile shareholders?I review our Fair Value on T-Mobile.","T-Mobile (TMUS) recently announced that it would start offering free Netflix (NFLX) plans to any subscriber with an unlimited family plan on T-Mobile with two or more lines. The news was generally perceived as a positive for all parties by the market. However is this really a good deal for T-Mobile customers and Netflix? Well, I happen to be a T-Mobile customer so lets take a look.Let me first start off by saying I am a very happy T-Mobile customer. I have tried T-Mobile, Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T) including having active subscriptions with all three at one point! I also travel a lot and the T-Mobile international data plan (The only one offering anything of the kind at the time apart from Google's Project Fi) convinced me to use them as my primary service provider and eventually I got rid of the other subscribers. So when T-Mobile announced they would include the cost of a Netflix subscription for anyone with an unlimited plan with 2+ lines, I was intrigued. Now while I am on a T-Mobile unlimited plan, I have had it for a few years and am on an older grandfathered plan that does not quality for the Netflix promotion. So T-Mobile asked me to switch to their latest T-Mobile ONE plan and I thought, why not? After all, it will save me a little over $120 per year since I already have a Netflix subscription. Well, here are the options it gave me.Source: T-MobileHuh. So I have the option of getting their unlimited plan with two lines for $100 per month or $120 per month with Netflix included. Well, the Netflix subscription only costs $10 a month! If you thought this was a good deal as a T-Mobile customer, well it most certainly is not.Ok, so it is not really such a great deal for T-Mobile customers, but what about Netflix? Well, lets consider the audience here.Is this really a target audience that is unlikely to have a Netflix subscription? Will this deal actually result in an increase in overall revenue for Netflix? I am not so sure.Netflix for its part has has been looking to start bundling its services as I believe it is hitting saturation in the US market. This deal falls in line with that. Since market participants seem to want to value Netflix purely on the basis of the size of the subscriber base, this may not be a bad strategy, at least in supporting the stock. Whether it is a long term positive for Netflix, the company, remains to be seen.The one group that I believe is getting a good deal here are T-Mobile shareholders.T-Mobile is essentially getting all the benefits of the free publicity and the general perception that it is adding value to its service while actually making a significant profit on a third party service it is bundling. What about valuation though? Over at FundamentalSpeculation, the most popular aspect of our service is our Relative Value Model that tries to determine fair value based on a cohort of companies with similar business fundamentals. Our model has fair value for T-Mobile pegged at ~$90.Source: FundamentalSpeculationIt is important to note here that the cohort of comparables is determined purely based on business fundamentals. For eg, as shown below, Sprint (S) is part of T-Mobile's cohort, not because it is another cellular service provider but because its business fundamentals are very similar to T-Mobile. This is also the reason other cellular providers such as Verizon and AT&T are not part of this cohort. Their fundamentals are just not that similar to T-Mobile even though they operate in the same industry. We believe this offers a more objective way to review what the ""Fair Value"" of a company should be.Source: FundamentalSpeculationYes, the Netflix deal is a positive. Not necessarily for Netflix itself and most certainly not for T-Mobile customers, but it is a positive for T-Mobile, the company and its shareholders. T-Mobile is driving the narrative as being the leader in offering value in cellular service and as our Relative Value Model shows, the stock still offers good value for people who believe in the company.Author's Update, September 13, 2017: A T-Mobile spokesperson reached out to me to clarify their position on the Netflix promotion, and I have included their statement below in full:"
4100665,101681,2017-08-21T11:01:42-04:00,Sprint's combination with T-Mobile will give it scale.Margins will be enhanced.Deal will create more value in the long-term.Execution risk will be lower.,"Sprint’s (NYSE:S) decision to negotiate with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is the best outcome for the shareholders of the company. I have been saying this for months that the company should focus on merging with T-Mobile, instead of exploring other combinations with cable companies. While the prospect of merging with a cable company opens a lot of doors for future growth; it also presents a number of challenges.After encouraging quarterly results, Sprint’s negotiating position has strengthened a little. The company had weakened its position by talking to the cable companies. It made Sprint look like a desperate business looking for a way out of its troubles. It is true that the company is facing a lot of challenges which can be taken care of through a merger. However, focusing on one partner from day one would have given Sprint a stronger position in negotiations.A merger in the same industry will bring a lot of benefits. It will give scale to the combined company. A larger scale will allow it to compete better with AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). AT&T and Verizon’s clout is too strong in the industry. Sprint will not be able to compete on price alone. Combining with T-Mobile will result in substantial synergies, which will allow the company to offer competitive rates and maintain a healthy margin. It will also improve the network and services. T-Mobile has progressed considerably in the last three years and the company is competing well against its two larger competitors.Combined EBITDA will be over $17 billion before we take into account the expected synergies from the deal. As synergies materialize and network expands, the combined company will be able to generate annual EBITDA in the range of $25 billion. Any deal between these two companies will most likely be an all-stock transaction. Valuing Sprint is not simple due to a large amount of debt. Near-term maturities make the process of valuation even more complex. It will not be a straightforward exercise of calculating an EV/EBITDA multiple. Sprint’s current EV/EBITDA multiple is around 6.7x, based on last year’s EBITDA figures. I am expecting this multiple to fall to around 6x if the stock price does not move higher (based on my full year 2017 EBITDA estimate of around $11 billion). T-Mobile’s multiple is close to 8x. It is slightly expensive due to the impressive performance of the stock in the last few quarters.Both managements will take into account the possible synergies, network enhancements and scale advantages, before agreeing on a deal value. It is clear that Sprint management wants to do a deal one way or the other. SoftBank’s (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) plans to buy Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) and merge it with Sprint (explained in my previous articles) is an extremely complicated deal and will not benefit the shareholders as much as a deal with T-Mobile would. Sprint’s debt is also complex as its subsidiaries have been raising debt and Sprint has provided guarantees. The image below shows the debt at the end of the last quarter.Source: 10-QMore than $39.5 billion was outstanding in long-term debt at the end of June. The current portion of its long-term debt is over $5 billion. Cash at hand is just $2.4 billion while annual operating cash flows are just over $4.1 billion. Sprint cannot meet these obligations from its operating cash flows and cash balances. Some of this debt will need to be renewed or reissued. As a result, leverage will remain high. Current leverage is over 4x. Such a bloated level of debt will be a key sticking point in valuation. The book value of debt accounts for almost 60% of the total enterprise value.If SoftBank is successful in acquiring Charter and merges it with Sprint, then Sprint’s shareholders might get a better deal in the short-term. The benefits of Charter merger will be clouded by the fact that the execution risk will be higher in combining two businesses from different industries. However, if Sprint merges with T-Mobile, then the execution risk will be lower and the integration will be easier. SoftBank will have to sacrifice control of the business, but it will get an experienced management team to work with. T-Mobile’s management have proven that they can take the business forward and compete with Verizon and AT&T. Synergies and wider network access will result in better margins and stronger fundamentals. Even if the valuation is on the lower side for Sprint shareholders, I believe this deal will be a better option in the long-term. Whatever the result, Sprint ownership has shown that they want to do a deal to consolidate the business. It is a time to hold this stock as any sort of a deal will unlock value and push the stock price higher."
4104286,95916,2017-09-05T17:34:44-04:00,"T-Mobile has more than doubled earnings growth year-over-year despite slowing subscriber growth.Its postpaid phone performance is key, and it remains the market leader.The network continues to defy my expectations of an unlimited-driven crash, but it remains the biggest risk factor in T-Mobile.Assuming no deluge of bandwidth hogs, T-Mobile should be able to maintain strong network, and therefore financial, performance.","With the news that T-Mobile (TMUS) is preparing a new Un-Carrier initiative to be unveiled on Wednesday, the spotlight shifts back to the insurgent CEO John Legere that initiated the wireless wars four years ago after Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T) both posted better than expected quarterly earnings last month. I won’t speculate about what the new initiative might encompass - you can read some of the speculation here if you’re curious what others are guessing. But one thing investors will be needing Wednesday is context in which to judge whatever they hear.I will review the performance of T-Mobile over the past few months as well as updating my thesis on the company.Four years of delivering lower prices and a competitive network have done wonders for a company once dismissed as an also-ran doomed to be merged into AT&T. T-Mobile now has the most “diehard” customers who love its combination of low prices, tax-inclusive pricing, and data-first network, and would never leave. The other three networks are loved more conditionally by their customers, contingent on things like network quality. That's more of a problem for SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY) owned Sprint (S) than it is for the Big Two, who after all do pretty well on network quality. However, it is best news of all for T-Mobile, which has managed to make itself the brand in wireless. It enjoys an almost Amazon-like reputation for treating its customers well, engendering trust that will allow them to continue to experiment with new approaches to network management, customer relations, etc.All is not completely rosy. The last few quarterly earnings reports have thrown up what might be considered a few caution flags. T-Mobile reported ARPU flat compared to year-ago levels, and management re-iterated its expectation that ARPU will remain flat over the coming quarters, with some variation corresponding to normal promotional spikes and ebbs. All of T-Mobile’s growth is thus coming from subscriber additions - it cannot seem to extract any additional revenue per user, as I noted earlier this year seemed to be likely to be the case.Meanwhile, that subscriber growth itself is not quite as strong as it once was, although it remains industry leading, at least by some metrics. In Q1 of 2017, T-Mobile subscriber growth slowed by over 1 million compared to previous levels, cutting it almost in half. Of 1.08 million fewer adds, they were split almost evenly between wholesale, which swung just over 530,000, and branded, which swung just under 550,000. Of the branded loss, most of it was concentrated in the prepaid segment, where T-Mobile is de-emphasizing its Magenta brand prepaid services and AT&T’s competitive challenge is intensifying. However, T-Mobile remained strong in the most important category. Branded postpaid fell less than 15% despite an onslaught of competitive pressure from Verizon and AT&T. Since these customers are the most high-quality credit and revenue, these are the additions that matter most.That isn’t a normative statement on my part. It is confirmed by T-Mobile’s own financials. I noted at the end of 2016 that T-Mobile financials had been remarkably steady and even predictable since the Un-Carrier revolution launched in 2013. Each year, it added somewhere between 8.2 and 8.3 million subscribers to its rolls, and each subscriber it added generated roughly $60 in additional net income, or $15 per quarter.That pattern held true for a while longer after I made note of it. In the last two quarters, however, T-Mobile has powered ahead with substantially stronger net income growth despite slowing subscriber additions. It increased net income in the most recent two quarters by $219 million and a staggering $356 million, respectively. From adding roughly $500 million in net income each year over the last four years, it has now added $575 million in net income in six months, with fewer subscriber additions.Though I sound like a broken record, I cannot help but reiterate once again my one big risk factor for T-Mobile - network congestion. I have said enough about that for a lifetime at this point, so I will not recap from scratch. You can read my previous takes on network capacity here and here. In a nutshell, I have never been convinced that T-Mobile can prevent a flood of ultra-high consumption cord-cutters imposing real strain on its networks, potentially causing serious damage to its service metrics and performance.But I have been saying that for almost two years, and T-Mobile continues to make me look foolish. In my last few articles I have therefore taken to asking a slightly different question: assuming T-Mobile can continue to keep a flood of cord-cutting data hogs from ruining its network for everyone, what does the rest of the network quality picture look like? In other words, if demand continues to grow normally rather than spiking, can T-Mobile increase the supply of bandwidth on its market fast enough to keep users happy?The answer to that is probably yes. T-Mobile came away as the biggest winner of the most recent FCC spectrum auction, acquiring over 30 MHz of nationwide spectrum at a bargain basement $8 billion price. While the auction did deplete T-Mobile’s cash reserves - they fell from $5.5 billion at the end of 2016 to less than $200 million last quarter - spectrum is vital to network quality, and T-Mobile more than quadrupled their holdings of low-band spectrum at a substantial discount to prevailing market spectrum rates.T-Mobile also will be the first to tap into new LTE-U services, the so-called unlicensed spectrum. Actually that is a bit of a misnomer: the spectrum is licensed, just not to one particular company. Rather it is allocated to WiFi services as a whole. What T-Mobile will have is the right to use the spectrum for additional capacity when there is spare capacity behind regular WiFi. WiFi, however, will remain first in line, so when there is congestion it is T-Mobile which must make way. In a rather rich irony, T-Mobile will be “throttled” when too many users are on the bandwidth, just as it throttles high-consumption customers.The rather slow rollout of LTE-U might be taken by some as a warning flag. T-Mobile so far only seems to have the capability in six smaller metro areas, despite promising a spring rollout. However, I'm not overly concerned here. LTE-U is new technology. Testing it slowly and in smaller areas is not only responsible tech development, it is responsible brand protection in case initial results don’t measure up. But T-Mobile should have no problem bringing the technology to market in due course since it retains most of the LTE architecture that has already become a mature technology.My concerns about network management always were, and remain, on the demand side. If a bunch of customers suddenly come onto the network angling to use 200-300 GB per month of data, or even just 100 GB, it is highly unlikely even T-Mobile could cope with such a sudden deluge. However, assuming they continue to prevent that from happening, I believe their efforts to expand bandwidth supply are more than adequate to meet reasonable mobile internet growth projections and keep their network performing at or near best-in-class levels.Slowing subscriber growth also does not concern me, as T-Mobile’s core postpaid phone platform continues to grow solidly. Analysts have long said that is where the key profit engine resides, and T-Mobile’s recent financials amply confirm that. Profit growth remains strong and even continues to accelerate. It seems somewhat redundant to make a formal recommendation when T-Mobile is less than 48hours away from launching a major new program that will probably require just revisiting the thesis all over again. I believe that pricing pressures within the wireless industry are likely to remain intense, and this makes any stock in the sector somewhat risky owing to margin pressures. But T-Mobile is continuing to grow profits despite the pressure. I consider T-Mobile to be a better bet than AT&T or Verizon at this point, though perhaps still not as good a bet as Sprint, owing to that company’s continued spectrum upside despite unmet expectations of a merger deal. Overall, T-Mobile is a good buy candidate for those who are comfortable with T-Mobile’s network strategy. Since I still can’t claim to fully understand how T-Mobile is doing what it is doing with regard to network performance, despite full unlimited video, I cannot claim to fall into that group. I am not buying or shorting T-Mobile at these levels. But I must admit my own warnings about network quality look increasingly out of step with the reality of the company’s performance. For those willing to put their trust in Legere and Co’s hog-avoiding tricks, T-Mobile may represent a good buy prospect.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4088574,103104,2017-07-18T22:20:52-04:00,T-Mobile has entered a prolonged period of overvaluation.Modeling T-Mobile shows an overvaluation of between 30% and 50%.T-Mobile gains are inconsistent with the industry.,"By Eric MasonOver the last five years, T-Mobile US, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TMUS) share price has grown by 366%, the fastest growing stock price of any of the five largest firms, ranked by subscribers. T-Mobile grew 273.17 times faster than AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and 2.73 times faster than Sprint Corporation (NYSE: S). The two remaining companies in the top five, Verizon Communication Inc. (NYSE: VZ) and United States Cellular Corporation (NYSE: USM), saw their share value decline in the previous five years.The question becomes, is T-Mobile’s rigorous growth real or just the product of a bubble?By examining multiple models, an investor can gain a unique perspective on the state of T-Mobile’s dramatic growth. The regressive models being used are based on three approaches: multivariate regression, pairs trading and auto-regression. All these models use daily historic data.The first is a multivariate regression using Verizon, AT&T, United States Cellular Corporation and Sprint share prices as the independent variables. This model yields a statistically significant result with a Significance F value of effectively 0, meaning the model has a virtually 0% likelihood of just being the product of chance, which means the stock prices from the aforementioned firms can accurately express the implicit value of T-Mobile’s stock, instead of just being the result of randomness. The model processes 6,290 data points into 1,258 observations, over the course of five years. Though it must be disclosed the United States Cellular Corporation’s variable was not statistically significant, but did not offer a dramatic increase in accuracy when the model was run without them.The above model demonstrates an overvaluation of 31.4%. This is far beyond even a liberal margin of error. More importantly, it shows a prolonged period of overvaluation. As the graph also expresses, the overvaluation has peaked in absolute value, but is still around an all-time high in terms of margin between observed and modeled.The assumptions in this model break down into the belief that the five largest cellular service providers experience the same market forces, and how their share value responds to these change is directly correlated to T-Mobile’s share value. This is important for helping an investor understand where T-Mobile is priced relative to the industry data. This series is based on historic data.The second model is based on pairs trading, which is an econometric approach to calculate the value of a stock based on another stock within the same industry, by regressing the two stocks. Furthermore, by generating a pairs trading model, an investor can gain considerable insight into the mechanisms and behavior of a stock. Pairs trading should be used in the short term to take advantage a stock’s misvaluation, though when viewed in a time series it helps determine whether or not an asset is in a prolonged period of overvaluation. Pairs trading modeling will write a usable manual on how actionable the conclusion of the modeling exercises is. As the second model, featured above, shows, a pairs trading model done individually with each stock used in the first model presents a consensus that T-Mobile is overvalued. Each line in the above graph shows a different valuation technique using a different stock in the first approach. The models' range in mean overvaluation is between 34.3% and 50.0%. They all are above their respective margins of error.This computation offers a dissection of the first model. While all the independent variables are the same, the use of them differs. This helps to unblur the previous model and allows an investor to see if there is just one independent variable throwing off the first model. This investigation yields that there is no individual data series from the first model that is dramatically affecting the result, and misrepresenting T-Mobile as overvalued. In fact, even United States Cellular Corporation, which was not statistically significant in the first model, is statistically significant in this approach.This result builds consensus across each agent in the market to establish, in a second silo, that T-Mobile is in a bubble. So, while T-Mobile has seen extensive growth in the last few quarters, this data suggest that it is from a bubble and not real growth.The final approach firmly establishes that T-Mobile’s growth is a bubble, based solely on its own valuation. The previous two analyses could be challenged by optimistic investors that T-Mobile is just experiencing dramatic firm specific growth and the other companies in the market cannot mimic; this is why the last model is an autoregressive model. Autoregressive modeling is exceptional at internalizing data, while it is relatively weak in expressing the market price of a stock; it is strong in detecting if a stock is fundamentally misvalued. The model is created by comparing the previous day’s adjusted close price with the current day’s closing share value, and this comparison is done through a linear regression. This allows an investor to estimate tomorrow's price at closing using the closing price today. When the projected share value begins to fall below the actual share value, this tells an investor that the stock is overvalued. This analysis also informs an investor if T-Mobile is in a bubble, by showing when the actual share price is above the modeled share price. In that circumstance, a bubble is likely. T-Mobile is currently displaying this symptom. This shows an investor that T-Mobile is susceptible to a sudden negative price correction.As the graph above shows, the data from T-Mobile itself indicates a misvaluation. While the overvaluation is only -6.8%, this approach has a much smaller margin of error. In fact, the plus or minus two standard deviations range from the mean of the coefficient for the independent variable is -9.65% to -3.89%. This renders the margin of error at around 3% in this model.To better frame this, the average daily variation over the last five years is .53% or less than a twelfth of the current misvaluation.By combining this model with the other two models the conclusion is clear, T-Mobile is overvalued and this assessment is supported by multiple econometric approaches which use over 7,500 observations, in just a five-year time frame. When all results are considered, it is clear that investors should stay clear of T-Mobile or take short positions against it."
4101446,45851,2017-08-23T16:39:16-04:00,"T-Mobile recently introduced Baby Boomer-friendly wireless plans in a bid to extend its run of strong subscriber growth.In addition, T-Mobile’s aggressive move in the 600MHz space should enable it to further pursue market share at the expense of its rivals.We show why these factors will contribute to further upside for T-Mobile shares, while showing Dividend Investors how they can use Preferred Shares to generate passive income while they wait.","We believe that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) could see earnings of as much as $3.50 per share by 2018 and, at the current forward multiple of 26x for its sector, we could see a medium-term target price of $91 per share for the stock. Additionally, we believe dividend investors can use the mandatory convertible preferred shares to generate passive income while waiting for shares to appreciate. T-Mobile recently picked up heavy business media chatter for introducing plans specifically targeted at Baby Boomers – or those aged 55 and above. This is a not insignificant segment: People in this age group account for 28% of the population in the United States while the median income for adults aged 55-74 age group is about 18% higher than the national median of $55,755. That being said, the average income for those 75 years or older drops significantly to less that $43,000 per annum, which is 23% less than the national median.In that sense, T-Mobile is probably targeting the older members of the Baby Boomer generation, allowing them to be added for their families existing plans for as little as $20 or for new connects at $60 for a pair of unlimited data plans. In contrast, T-Mobile's standard plan gives each member of a family of four a line starting at $160.Among the ""Big Four"" wireless telco giants in the United States, T-Mobile alone has seen its shares pick up value in 2017, rising by 9.4% even as Sprint (S), AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) shares have lost an average of 8.8%. Indeed, the benchmark Dow Jones Telecom ETF itself has lost over 10% in the year-to-date.The impetus behind this rise isn’t difficult to discern: Although T-Mobiles subscriber growth has tapered, it is picking up Wireless share at the expense of Verizon and has managed to surpass earnings estimates in each of its last four quarters. T-Mobile has shown itself to be the most nimble of the Big Four operators. Apart from introducing its Baby Boomer plans recently, it has an aggressive roll-out plan for its newly-awarded 600 MHz band that should enable it to provide 600MHz band coverage for 1 million square miles of the continental United Sates by the end of this year.At the same time, T-Mobile could benefit from Apple’s (AAPL) plans to introduce LTE-enabled Apple Watches, which would require separate wireless service – thus allowing it to generate additional revenue from existing customers or providing another vector by which it can lure other networks’ subscribers away.Interestingly enough, T-Mobile’s common shares are trading nearly 7% below its 2017 closing high of $68.32 that it registered in early June. To be sure, T-Mobile’s shares have rallied smartly since hitting a recent closing nadir of $59.45.The rationale behind T-Mobile’s pursuit of Baby Boomers is simple: Subscriber growth is slowing and T-Mobile needs to target more specific market segments to sustain it. T-Mobile added just 2.5 million new post-paid subscribers in the first half of 2017 – or 1.8 million less than the 4.3 million it added in the first half of 2016.The Baby Boomer segment is around 90.5 million strong, but only around three-fourths of those who are aged 50-64 own smartphones (which would take advantage of T-Mobiles unlimited data) while less than half (42%) of those aged 65 and over own one. In that sense, T-Mobile probably sees an opportunity to add at least a few million subscribers to its roll paying just 25% less than its regular subscribers.While this might not sound particularly enticing, it should be noted that just adding just 500,000 baby boomer subscribers would give T-Mobile an additional $180 million in revenue – for additional earnings of $0.018 per share, all other things being equal. Assuming T-Mobile picks up 4 million new subscribers in the next 3 years this way, it could be looking at $0.15 in additional earnings per share each year. This alone could add $3.60 to the current market price.The Preferred WayFor dividend investors interested in T-Mobile, the way to bet on T-Mobile while still generating passive income is through its mandatory convertible preferred shares (TMUSPRA), which are currently paying an effective dividend yield of 2.62%. These preferred shares will convert into a set number of common shares on conversion date so their price tracks that of the underlying security – thus, a rise in the price of T-Mobile common shares will result in a rise in the price of T-Mobile preferred shares.It is extremely important for investors to bear in mind that T-Mobile’s mandatory convertible preferred shares will convert into common shares by mid-December (i.e. exactly December 15th) into 1.6119 common shares of T-Mobile for every mandatory convertible preferred shares – unless T-Mobile’s shares fall below $31.02 per share, which is highly unlikely, so investors who buy the preferred shares now can pick up a yield of 90 basis points and the opportunity to acquire T-Mobile shares at $65.05 per share (i.e. based on the current preferred share market price of $104.85 divided by 1.6119).So far, T-Mobile has elected to pay preferred dividends in cash, but there is the possibility that T-Mobile will elect to pay in shares, in which case, T-Mobile can pay a make-whole dividend as stipulated in its convertible preferred share prospectus.While this doesn’t seem like a particularly good deal since their effective break-even conversion price is currently above T-Mobile’s common share price, investors should bear in mind that after subtracting the value of the preferred dividend, their effective ""cost"" of acquiring T-Mobile shares after paying for its mandatory convertible preferred shares would be $64.09 per share – so depending on where T-Mobile’s shares settle on the conversion date, they could be looking at an immediate upside of 9% (for example, if T-Mobile’s common shares are at $70 by then).Moreover, investors can elect to sell their shares if the underlying common shares appreciate to the extent that their capital gains on their preferred share holdings exceed the capital gains they could realize by converting to common shares on December 15th. Even so, at our current target price of $91 per share for the common stock, dividend investors who buy T-Mobile’s preferred shares would be best served by allowing their shares to convert rather than selling prior to the conversion.We haven’t covered T-Mobile in recent years because of its lack of common share dividends, but the imminent conversion of T-Mobile’s mandatory convertible preferred shares is a welcome opportunity for dividend focused investors to take a position on the stock.On top of earning nearly 1% in passive income over the short term (i.e. the next 4 months), dividend investors can look forward to converting into a stock that we believe has upside of 42% over the medium-term (i.e. 18 to 24 months), especially if T-Mobile management’s initiatives bear fruit and its aggressive accretion of market share continues."
4073169,97946,2017-05-15T05:47:05-04:00,"Both T-Mobile and Sprint officials confirm the companies are looking to merge.Strategically, T-Mobile holds all the power in the relationship.T-Mobile can drag things out as long as desired.Sprint longs and shorts can both profit from selling volatility.Annualized gains of > 80% are possible.","Perhaps, the worst-kept secret in mergers and acquisitions today is the budding love affair between Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Despite calling off the possible joining of the companies last year due to regulatory constraints, interest seems to be building on both sides, with management confirming this desire; conventional wisdom is that the Trumpian White House will encourage the regulatory regime to be more accommodating to corporate activity.Commentators and analysts are starting to pick up on the power dynamic between the two companies. As Bloomberg's Lachapelle astutely details, T-Mobile has been wildly successful over the past few years, while Sprint continues to lose subscribers and revenue. Look below: T-Mobile has rocketed its revenue from 2013, while Sprint has steadily declined.This, along with the prodigious cash burn of Sprint, shows the obvious: T-Mobile holds all the cards here. With this in mind, we can make a couple of predictions:As an investor, how does one profit from this?Well, one can certainly make a directional bet here, either long or short; plenty of cogent arguments have been made on both sides. However, I want to highlight here the potential to profit from selling volatility, whether you're long or short. As noted above, it seems quite likely that nothing will crystallize around the merger (in either a positive or negative fashion) any time soon. Thus, if you already have a direction in mind, this presents a great opportunity to generate some returns while you wait for a resolution.For example: take a look at the May 26th weekly 8.0 puts. As of Friday, these were trading for right around $0.30. With a share price of $8, that ends up being a 3.1% yield if shares of Sprint stay at or above $8 in just two weeks. That's a phenomenal yield for such a short period of time. If you continued to roll this trade forward every two weeks for a year, you would make 82%!Of course, for a little more safety, one could push those puts out a few months, to August. Here's how that math works out:So, with a little more safety (a cushion of a 10% move in either direction in a few months), one has the possibility of a 37.5% annualized gain. That's not too bad. One can play with the strike price and option expiration that's attractive for their individual needs, but the volatility in Sprint is so high that selling either a covered call (for longs) or a covered put (for shorts) will allow for hefty returns over the next few months when I expect little directional movement in the share price of Sprint. Personally, I prefer keeping the expiration short, as you capture greater premiums and are able to keep rolling the options forward closer to the money.(As a brief parenthetical, this strategy could also work with shares of T-Mobile as well. I prefer shares of Sprint, as they're more volatile (and thus will allow for larger premiums to be collected), but one can make the same directional bet + short volatility with T-Mobile to suit their needs.)Are there risks with this strategy? Certainly. The greatest risk is that resolution of the merger outcome could come sooner than expected. With negotiations yet to even begin and the journey through the regulatory hurdles unclear, I find that risk to be quite manageable. However, it's definitely possible that the deal dissolves or is consummated quicker than is currently expected; if the options you sell are closer to the money, this would kill any directional bet that you've established. However, for an annualized gain of 80%, that's a risk I'm willing to take."
4088632,67775,2017-07-19T07:57:18-04:00,"Shares of T-Mobile have lost more than 10% of their value since their June high as merger talks with Sprint have slowed.While the market speculates over a potential merger, investors may be missing the obvious opportunity: T-Mobile..This is a high growth company that appears undervalued on a relative and future cash flow basis.","It has been widely reported that T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) had been in merger talks with Sprint Corporation (S), a competitor that is majority owned by SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY). However, these talks are now on hold as Sprint is negotiating potential deals with two of the largest cable companies in the United States, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR). These cable companies are under pressure having lost subscribers due to services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which recently blew away its second quarter growth estimates.Investors long shares of T-Mobile have been rewarded as the stock is up over 35% within the last year. But shares have lost more than 10% of their value since their June high as merger talks with Sprint have slowed.While the market speculates over a potential merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, or a tie up between Sprint and both Charter and Comcast, investors may be missing the obvious opportunity. T-Mobile is a great asset that generates strong cash flows. Regardless of what happens with Sprint, there is value in owning TMUS shares on a standalone basis.Finbox.io's intrinsic value estimate of $73.01 implies that the stock is nearly 20% undervalued. The estimate is calculated by applying Wall Street projections to seven separate valuation analyses.Notice how the four discounted cash flow models project significant upside while those based on comparable companies' multiples show downside. However, this may be misleading given that T-Mobile's growth profile is not highly comparable with other traditional mobile service providers.T-Mobile is a significant player in the US mobile telecommunications space. It is the third largest by subscribers, with 72 million customers as of early 2017. When analysts compare T-Mobile, they often compare them to the likes of Sprint, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T). This makes sense considering they offer very similar services but what is not similar is their underlying growth profiles as illustrated below.T-Mobile's sales growth has outperformed and is expected to continue outperforming its peer group. The company's 5yr revenue CAGR of 12.6% is above Sprint (-0.2%), Verizon (2.6%) and AT&T (5.3%). And when comparing Wall Street's consensus forecast for each company, T-Mobile's projected 5yr revenue CAGR of 6.1% is also above Sprint (1.1%), Verizon (0.7%) and AT&T (1.5%).T-Mobile has grown its top line by more than 2.0x its closest peer and is expected to grow by more than 4.0x its closest peer going forward. One could argue that T-Mobile's growth profile is much more similar to high flying Netflix whose revenue growth has outperformed T-Mobile's by only 2.0x to 3.0x.Furthermore, the company's EBITDA growth has outperformed all peers (including Netflix) over the last 3 years.The superior performance helps explain why T-Mobile's forward EBITDA multiples trade at a 1.0x premium to its traditional peer group: Sprint, Verizon and AT&T. However, it does not explain why the EBITDA multiple of Netflix trades at a 10.0x premium to T-Mobile.The company's profits are actually expected to grow at a faster pace than the stock market's darling: Netflix. As a result, one could argue that T-Mobile's multiples should be trading closer to that of Netflix. Given the company's high growth profile, TMUS shares appear significantly undervalued on a relative basis as well as a future cash flow basis.T-Mobile is an undervalued asset that value investors may want to take a closer look at before the mobile services provider reports earnings on Wednesday after the market closes. Whether or not a deal progresses with Sprint, the company looks extremely attractive on a future cash flow as well as on a relative basis."

Such is the situation, I believe, with telecom companies in the United States. Listening to the quarterly conference calls of the telecom giants in the U.S., it is becoming harder and harder to deny that this is an industry in flux.It is true that the lines between entertainment and communication are blurring, but it's more than just that. All content is moving to the mobile internet, and telecommunications carriers are ultimately going to be responsible for facilitating the spectrum and infrastructure to transmit all that.Because the internet was built for unlimited access to data, it will be difficult for both carriers and content providers to put a unit price on data or content like they have with cable TV or traditional telecommunication. If there is a limit to how much data consumers want, we have not hit it yet. Data traffic continues to grow across the country as more and more consumers switch to 4G and 5G devices. The need for data infrastructure should rise subsequently.If the telecom industry were still a ""slap-happy oligopoly,"" to borrow a phrase from Jim Cramer, then maybe the telecom carriers could go on business as usual. However, T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS), a spinoff formerly Deutsche Telekom's US cellular division, has proven to be quite the disruptor. In the first quarter of this year T-Mobile has effectively forced both AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to capitulate and offer unlimited data plans, something both said they wouldn't do, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. T-Mobile is taking share from the carriers and then some.Transforming the industryIn a nutshell, T-Mobile is transforming this industry by forcing the other carriers to offer unlimited access to mobile data, and at a flat monthly rate with adequate bandwidth to meet an ever-growing demand. Until 2021, mobile data traffic is expected to grow by 35% compounded annually.Unlike most other competitors, T-Mobile's network was built for unlimited use at a good speed, and their low simple rates are attracting an unprecedented number of customers who are frustrated with the other carriers.The results come thought pretty clearly. Last quarter T-Mobile added 1.1 million post-paid smartphones, marking four consecutive years of over 1 million net adds each quarter. The other big carriers would kill to have that type of growth. Service revenue also increased another 11%, as did overall revenue.T-Mobile has built up its network to the point where it is comparable in speed and reliability to even Verizon. I believe that, once most users switch to unlimited, T-Mobile's network might even be better than Verizon's over time, because T-Mobile's network was specifically built for unlimited use customer plans. Just this quarter T-Mobile won about 45% of all new spectrum auctioned off by the government, a move which bodes very well for T-Mobile's network in the years ahead.Financially nimbleDespite being a smaller company with fewer financial resources at its disposal than its competitors, T-Mobile is able to rapidly build out its network like it has because it does not pay out a dividend, which makes the company much more financially nimble.For example, over the last twelve months Verizon generated $22 billion in operating cash flow, $17.5 billion had to go to capital expenditure, leaving only $5.1 billion in free cash flow, but the company's $9.2 billion dividend obligation means that Verizon has to take out debt and lean on its balance sheet to fulfill its capex obligations.T-Mobile, on the other hand, generated $6.1 billion in operating cash flow, and capital expenditure was $8.67 billion, leaving the company a ""funding gap"" of $2.5 billion, even though last quarter T-Mobile did generate some free cash flow. The point is, the huge dividend commitments on both Verizon and AT&T are serious handicaps in a time where a lot of capital investment is going to be needed to meet ever-growing data needs. T-Mobile's relative financial flexibility is part of the reason why T-Mobile has been able to disrupt the US telecom industry like it has over the last few years.Buy the disruptorTelecom in the U.S. is changing rapidly, but I believe this change is a lot more simple then what some are making it out to be. Cable and wireless are converging onto the mobile internet. Ultimately that means telecoms will soon be providers of unlimited internet access at a flat monthly rate. Other telecoms still don't have the desire to be that, but in the words of CEO John Legere, ""they're going to have to swallow it.""Simple as that may be, it is in that radical simplicity that T-Mobile is able become increasingly efficient as a company, particularly at the installation and customer service level. By 2019 T-Mobile hopes to cut call center calls in half, and set up service in half the time per customer.Courtesy of Google Finance.There's no doubt at all that shares of T-Mobile are pretty expensive, and it's been going higher over the last twelve months especially. However, of all the major telecoms in the U.S., T-Mobile is the one that ""gets it,"" and is the best suited for the future. And that future actually looks pretty good because the demand for mobile data only continues to grow.For its part, T-Mobile is profitable and plans to become more and more so. Net income grew 46% year-on-year in the last quarter, and T-Mobile posted free cash flow (that is, operating cash flow minus capital expenditure) of $185 million. Management expects 45% compound annual growth in free cash flow up until 2019, with 15%-18% compound annual growth in operating cash flow until the same time. Increased cash flow could result in buybacks or possibly deleveraging.I would not expect a dividend anytime soon, but there seems to be a lot of growth ahead. People are going to increasingly turn to T-Mobile, and as need for mobile data increases the company's revenue is only going to grow. T-Mobile is the disruptive business in an industry which has a big secular tailwind behind it. For this reason, I consider T-Mobile a buy despite the runup in share price and lack of a dividend.ConclusionT-Mobile is forcing the U.S. telecom industry to turn a new leaf. For some this change will be painful, but investing in T-Mobile is a good way to embrace that change. If you're interested in T-Mobile US, feel free to follow me here on Seeking Alpha. I intend to follow this company more closely in the future, and I will write update articles when doing so is both material and relevant."

        Better net adds, better ARPU, better churn.
        Is TMUS a no-brainer? Not so fast.","In the early hours of February 14th, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) delivered yet another of its trademark strong quarters. Total revenues of $10.2 billion beat consensus $9.8 billion, pointing to an 10.5% YOY improvement in service revenues. EPS of $0.45 beat expectations for the fifth consecutive quarter.Credit: htcsource.comGrowth investors will likely appreciate the company's 933,000 branded postpaid net additions in the quarter, which is even higher than 4Q15's 917,000. On the postpaid front, therefore, T-Mobile seems to be not only gobbling market share away from its larger competitors, but it is doing so at a slightly accelerating pace.The graph below shows the cumulative branded postpaid net add evolution in 2016 for T-Mobile, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). Despite a much smaller user base, the incumbent continues to add more customers to its network than anyone else in the U.S. -- about as much last year as both Verizon and AT&T combined.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsThere are two other key performance metrics that improved this quarter and caught my attention. First, branded postpaid churn of 1.28% was the lowest that it has been since at least 4Q15. This number still compares unfavorably to Verizon's 1.1% and AT&T's 1.16% last quarter, but the gap is much narrower now. And second, branded postpaid ARPU, the highest it has been in 2016, increased in the comparison to 4Q15: $48.37 vs. $48.05, suggesting not only user base growth but pricing resilience.Source: T-Mobile's factbookOn the financial statements side, cost of services as a percentage of service revenues dropped to 19.9% vs. 21.1% in 4Q15, contributing to the earnings beat. Opex also came down relative to sales, both on the SG&A and on the D&A ends. As the graphs below indicate, FCF (free cash flow) in 4Q16 was the best in the year, even if trailing 4Q15 levels, and net debt-to-EBITDA continues to come down.Source: T-Mobile's factbookSo is TMUS a no-brainer?With basically nothing but good news to share from T-Mobile's 4Q16 earnings release, one might be tempted to assume that buying the stock today is a no-brainer. But let's take a step back.Yesterday's annoucement that Verizon will once again offer unlimited data plans indicate that the U.S. telecom leader is not willing to just watch T-Mobile continue to gain market significance without doing anything about it. All major U.S. carriers now offer unlimited data plans, each with its own flavor and price.Source: CNBCTo become more competitive, I would not be surprised to see AT&T drop its price or eliminate the DirecTV bundling requirement on its unlimited data plan next. And at $80/month, Verizon customers might start thinking twice before switching to T-Mobile, as Big Red still seems to be perceived by many as a superior mobile service provider.And lastly, TMUS continues to be very aggressively priced compared to its peers. Sure, a 2017 forward P/E of 33.3x might be justifiable to some investors, considering how T-Mobile seems to be so much better positioned for growth than its competitors. But even adjusting for short-term EPS growth expectations, as provided by Nasdaq, TMUS still looks richly valued. On a 2019 basis, TMUS trades today at 16.6x forward earnings. By comparison, VZ trades at 11.4x and T at 12.5x.Due to increasing competitive pressures, the potential price and market share wars, and the rich valuations, I tip my hat to T-Mobile for delivering a solid quarter, but stay away from the stock for now.Note from the author: follow me as I build a risk-diversified portfolio designed and back-tested to generate market-like returns with lower risk.

4059829,95916,2017-04-03T12:35:14-04:00,"T-Mobile is a remarkably steady growth company. Each year it adds 8.2-8.3 million subscribers at $60 per year in profit per subscriber.It has achieved this in part through a series of price hikes over the last two years. Prices have increased while services have been cut, despite the company's consumer-friendly reputation.The recent outbreak of unlimited data plan competition, initiated by Verizon, has forced T-Mobile prices back below original 2013 levels, while all cut services have been restored and even enhanced.T-Mobile's P/E remains near 40, and the stock may become increasingly risky.It's unlikely to be left unaffected as it was in prior years since this time it is not the one initiating and controlling the changes.","I have written a couple of articles about the damage the new wireless price wars could do to Ma Bell. My conclusions were not generally accepted, to say the least, and I don't want to opine further on AT&T (NYSE:T) until we get some more clarity. The upcoming earnings report should tell us something.I did, however, want to examine another company which may be in for a rather rude awakening. Many have portrayed recent events as vindicating the policies of T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and its Un-Carrier strategy. Those policies were vindicated years ago, as far as I'm concerned. But T-Mobile may have been let off too easy by those who see the latest events as a sign it is winning the war. The truly alarming thing about the wireless market is not what Verizon (NYSE:VZ) did, but the response of the original instigator of the wireless price wars.T-Mobile's Steady Hand May Be ShakingGenerally, people tend to think of T-Mobile as being somewhat insulated from the effects of the price wars. And this is not entirely incorrect. As I have noted, T-Mobile has shown a remarkably consistent profit trajectory over the last three years, adding 8.2-8.3 million subscribers each year and each subscriber adding $60 per year to net income. It's been incredibly steady. And the ebbs and flows of wireless competition don't really seem to affect it.But there is one important caveat here. T-Mobile is usually the one instigating the ebbs and flows, which allows it to set the tone according to its own cash flow growth. Now, Verizon is the one kicking off the contest, and T-Mobile has been forced into a series of responses it probably wasn't planning on. I believe T-Mobile may have taken a stronger hit from this latest bout than previous ones, and that with its P/E still well above industry norms (38 compared to 15.5 for Verizon) and competition accelerating, T-Mobile stock remains a risky investment.To understand why this is, I must first review T-Mobile's history a little to give some context to these observations.History Of The Un-Carrier RevolutionWhen T-Mobile first began its Un-Carrier revolution, almost four years ago to the day today, it only charged $50 for the fist line, $30 for the second, and $10 for all additional lines. Since it charged an extra $20 per line for unlimited, this meant it was $70 for a full unlimited data plan on the first line. The second was $50 and three and up were $30 apiece.This pricing structure stayed intact for over two years as T-Mobile slowly clawed its way back to relevance in the wireless industry. But Legere and Co. always said that they weren't sure unlimited data was sustainable in the long term. When they announced their Un-Contract initiative, guaranteeing that prices for service would never go up as long as a subscriber stayed with the company, unlimited data plans were specifically excluded. And as T-Mobile started to grow faster and faster, the company began to wonder if it still needed network-straining unlimited any longer.In March 2015, after two years, T-Mobile hiked the price of the unlimited plan $10, to $80/$60/$40 a month. When subscriber growth continued unabated, the company decided it was safe to really start to push customers away from those plans. A second, $15 hike came just eight months later, hidden in the fine print of the Un-Carrier 10 Binge On program. And then the third hike was Un-Carrier 12, the T-Mobile ONE program ten months after that.ONE Clever Way To Hike PricesThat's right, the initial T-Mobile ONE from T-Mobile, which was billed as a huge price cut, was actually a straight up price hike, and the biggest one by far. This is because there was no combination of prices and services under the original ONE plan which did not yield a higher price level for equivalent services. Although T-Mobile claimed at the time it had cut the price of ""Unlimited"" plans, this was little more than a labeling gimmick. What it called Unlimited after UC 12 was cheaper than what it called Unlimited before, but that is only because it had changed the definition of what ""Unlimited"" means.Before Un-carrier 12, Unlimited consisted of an HD video streaming experience and 14 GB of high-speed tethering data, along with all the other data services available on the Internet. For this T-Mobile charged $95 for an individual or $140 for two lines, with $40 per additional line, after the first two price hikes. With ONE, the equivalent prices for identical services were $110 for an individual or $200 for two lines plus $60 per additional line. In other words, a $20-$30 price hike, as big as the two previous hikes combined. And even then, the tethering component only includes 5GB, not 14GB.T-Mobile's ""cheaper"" came from allowing customers to avoid some of these price hikes by dropping one of the services that were before included in the price. Customers were told they could save $25 per line by surrendering HD video and accepted downgraded 480p streams. They also could save $15 a line by surrendering the high-speed data allotment. They could save $40 by surrendering both, hence the advertised $70 price for one line, $120 for two, and $20 for each succeeding line.Pressure Forces Restored ServicesCustomer response has been a series of protests and jeers, and T-Mobile had already been forced into a partial retreat before the latest outbreak of price hostilities. The ultra-slow 2G speeds on hotspot data had been raised to a more manageable, even passable, 3G.But those were just tweaks. The basic thrust of ONE, higher prices or lower data speeds compared to before, remained. No longer. It took T-Mobile less than a day to announce that it was matching the terms of Verizon's wireless offer, incorporating 10GB of high-speed hotspot data into their own T-Mobile ONE plan and also HD streaming. T-Mobile initially said HD would have to be enabled every 30 days. But customer outcry prompted yet another reversal only 24 hours later. Now, it is truly one free upgrade and you're done, for as long as you stay on your plan.The net result is that T-Mobile has been forced to reverse almost every major price increase or service cut it had gradually put in place over the last two years. Unlimited is truly unlimited again: full HD streaming and double-digit capacity for high-speed hotspot data for anyone who wants it at no extra charge.Pricing Masks Full Extent Of Revenue PressureEven worse for T-Mobile, though, is the price impact. When it first cut headline prices it assumed it would get away with offering lower services. As it turns out, services are restored, but the price cuts enacted with ONE are here to stay. T-Mobile is back to $70 for one line and $50 for the second, and now additional lines only go for $20 instead of $30. So at an average of three lines, same as AT&T and Verizon, T-Mobile is now making $140 where four years ago it would have gotten $150.What's more, those prices don't go as far as they used to. The headline prices actually mask the full extent of the decline here. Inflation aside, T-Mobile's Un-Carrier 13 saw T-Mobile fold all the taxes and fees into the headline price, with no corresponding adjustment. With taxes and fees making up upwards of 15% a total bill, the revenue T-Mobile actually gets to keep is more like $120, a full 20% cut from 2013.Some might argue that T-Mobile is actually better off than it looks because under the old Simple Choice plans customers got their choice of data buckets. They didn't have to buy Unlimited, now they do. So before revenue for three lines could have been as low as $90, now it's guaranteed $120.This is wrong, too, though, unfortunately. Yes, Unlimited is now required, and before Un-Carrier 13 that was probably helping hold revenue up. But now T-Mobile's ""KickBack"" promotion offers $10 rebates to everyone who keeps their data consumption under 2 GB - the exact same amount as the old base plan. Subtracting $30 from the $120 leaves….$90. The exact same they were getting before.Altogether, T-Mobile has, far from raising unlimited prices, actually cut them 20% since 2013. Despite offering far higher speeds and more features like tethering, it has cut prices. And it has done this under competitive pressure, not of its own volition. Base plan prices haven't gone down but after adjusting for KickBack and taxes included haven't gone up, either.T-Mobile Caught In Its Own TrapThis does not mean T-Mobile is doomed to sink back into the red. Wireless service is a very high fixed-cost business, and it still has 30 million more subscribers than it did before, so its not back at square one financially even with the hit it took. But the implications of this full-on retreat are still substantial. Unlike Verizon, a high-cost provider responding to new competition, T-Mobile is the competition. It offers best-in-class customer service, highest customer satisfaction, and best-in-class wireless features, including unlimited data and complementary tethering at no extra charge.And yet apparently, none of this is enough to get T-Mobile out of the pricing basement. It can only stay relevant and growing by cutting prices an additional 20% from where they already were when it was just an upstart wanna-be carrier four years.Financial EstimatesIt is admittedly a little difficult to put a precise number on the damage. Since we have never seen T-Mobile in this position before since it started the price war four years ago, we don't have a lot of history to go on where Verizon is the price leader and T-Mobile is the follower. Three years ago T-Mobile reported a $247 million gain, last year with another 16.5 million subscribers on the rolls it reported a $1.4 billion net income. That was slightly inflated by an abnormally large spectrum gain, but on the other hand per-customer profit levels would probably have kept increasing absent the new competitive pressures.Assume that the spectrum and per-customer delta cancel each other out. If its profit per customer from 2014, before the price hikes, was transposed to 2016 it would yield a total of just $323 million. But that is most definitely too conservative. As I said, wireless always becomes far more profitable when there are more customers to spread the high fixed costs over.Averaging the per-customer profits of the two periods yields a projected net income of $876 million. But that is at current subscriber levels, and the whole point of this price cutting is to keep growing. Taking subscriber levels up to 80 million at the same profit level puts the net income at $980 million. Without more hard data and history, that is my best guess right now, but I'd be the first to admit its a rough estimate.But the thrust of the recent changes is clear regardless. T-Mobile's behavior confirms not just that the wireless sector is in a pricing war, which we already knew. It confirms that T-Mobile's own strategy to start low on the pricing pole and then work its way up as it became more competitive also is a victim of the war the company created. After four years and two years of attempted price hikes T-Mobile is back where it started and then some. With unlimited data likely to drive increased capital expenditures, the inability of even the top performing company in the wireless sector to enact any meaningful price hike portends great days for consumers, but not such good ones for shareholders.ConclusionRecent events have not been just a case of Verizon responding while T-Mobile carries on as it always has. T-Mobile took a heavy blow in the latest round of price wars as well. While I do not believe the carrier is in any danger of falling back into the red, recent events only raise the risk of T-Mobile stock, with its high P/E ratio, in an industry where earnings and profits are getting harder and harder to hold on to."
4053529,24992,2017-03-08T23:07:19-05:00,"Shares are trading at a 42% premium to the overall market.Since 2012, long-term debt has grown at the same rate (CAGR 13%) as company's revenue!Debt obligations due over the next three years should give investors a reason to worry.ChartMasterPro downward target price of $56.00.","Shares of T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) are up about 58% over the past twelve months and this presents a dilemma to current and would-be shareholders. Are these gains set to last? Sadly, the answer is NO in my view. I'll go through my reasoning by highlighting the large debt load, the low margin, and most importantly, the excessive price that people are now paying for this business.Much might be made of the fact that revenue at T-Mobile has grown at a CAGR of ~13% since 2012. That is an admittedly impressive feat, but there are two things to keep in mind. First, investors aren't compensated by revenue; they are compensated by net income. This is the source of book value, or, for common shareholders of T-Mobile, some hopeful future date when they'll be paid a dividend. In my view, shareholders will be waiting a long time, as the margins generated on that revenue are so thin (just shy of 4% in 2016). Second, long-term debt has grown at about the same rate over the same period, and debt and other obligations are really troublesome here.A comparison between the totality of obligations that this company faces, from long-term debt to interest on long-term debt, to capital and operating leases etc. on the one hand, and current operating income on the other, should give an investor pause. Specifically, the company generated approximately $3.8 billion in operating income in 2016, and they have $6.8 billion in various obligations over the next year alone. The amount of obligations continues to rise over the 1-3 year period ($13.2 billion) and the 4-5 year period ($15 billion). In addition, the fact that the weighted average interest rate on the debt is 6.4% is a sign that the credit markets seem to agree that things are a bit stretched.There can be only two sources for these shortfalls: more debt or more dilution. It's possible that the company will stick to type and take on more debt. ""Kicking the can down the road"" in this way only compounds the problem and will make it worse in future. If the company takes advantage of the current share price and does a share offering, current shareholders will obviously be diluted. In short, neither debt nor dilution is good for common shareholders, but these two paths seem the only way out.The StockAs I've said repeatedly, unfortunately, we can't access the cash flows of businesses directly. We need to buy the surrogates (stocks) that supposedly reflect the health of the underlying business. In the short term, stock price movements obviously vary dramatically from one period to the next (is T-Mobile really 58% more valuable today than it was twelve months ago), and those movements are usually more dramatic than anything that's happening in most companies. What is particularly strange when looking at the stock in my view is the fact that the market is paying a hefty premium (of 42%) over the overall market for a company that generates low single-digit margins. When you consider that with an earnings yield of ~5.5% (because of the EV/EBIT of 18), the premium price becomes even stranger in my view.Technical SnapshotAs per our ChartMasterPro Daily Price model, the trend for TMUS turned bearish on March 7 when the shares broke below a bearish wedge pattern that had formed on the daily charts. From here, we see the shares falling to the $56.00 level over the next three months.Today, we purchased the TMUS 19MAY17 60 Put Options which will provide us with approximately 8x leverage on our Long trade. Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close above $64.00.For investors in the shares we recommend that you Sell in order to avoid any further drop in the share price.CMPro PortfolioAs of today, the directional allocation of our trading portfolio stands as follows: Long 9%, Short 18%, Cash 73%.ConclusionThe herd has certainly embraced shares of T-Mobile over the past year, but as the price of the shares rise, so too does the risk that these price increases cannot continue. Additionally, operational risks associated with the many burdens this company is facing compound the risk to shareholders at this point, as both solutions to these obligations are bad. In my view, it makes the most sense to avoid T-Mobile until the shares come back down to Earth, as they inevitably will in my view."

        T-Mobile has been stealing customers from Verizon.
        Verizon has lost it's competitive service edge against T-mobile.","Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) used to be known for it's fast speeds, impressive coverage, and good customer deals. Now, VZ has lost it's competitive edge, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has caught up to VZ in terms of speed and coverage. As a result, TMUS has been poaching VZ and other carrier's customers. TMUS offers a much more promising future than VZ.VZ reported first quarter earnings on Thursday missing analyst expectations. They reported an EPS of $0.95 versus analyst expectations of $0.96, They also reported a revenue miss of $29.814 billion dollars versus an analyst expectation of $30.487 billion dollars. VZ had a net loss of 307,000 retail postpaid subscribers Analysts were expecting that there would be a net gain of over 220,000 postpaid subscribers. VZ has been feeling the heat lately as TMUS and other carriers are starting to gain ground on them, the competitive advantage VZ once had is virtually gone. People are beginning to realize that not only does VZ not have a significant carrier speed and coverage advantage, but they also do not have the best value deals.TMUS was the first to introduce a new unlimited data plan last Autumn and it has changed the carrier industry for the better. Slowly one by one, all of the other carriers followed and also introduced their own unlimited data plans. VZ was the last to introduce their unlimited plan. When VZ finally did bring back their unlimited plan, TMUS was prepared. TMUS quickly fired back and updated their own unlimited plan. This is the final result.Diagram SourceTMUS clearly offers the better deal for customers, the diagram above does not even mention how TMUS only throttles data after 30GB, Sprint (NYSE:S) throttles after 23GB and AT&T (NYSE:T) and VZ both throttle after 20GB. The customer is not stupid, they will know a better deal when they see one, the first quarter net decline in subscribers from VZ is a clear sign of this. Last quarter, TMUS added 2.1 million customers in Q4 and around 993 million postpaid subscribers. It marked the 15th straight quarter of adding over a million in customers. TMUS was also the only carrier which is actually adding net prepaid and postpaid subscribers in 2016, they accounted for around 103 percent of the industry growth for 2016. All of the other carriers had a net loss. They have actually have been the industry leader in postpaid net gains for the past 3 years. The unlimited plan is working to capture more customers, the past year is evident of that. VZ has been unable to provide a better incentive for people to switch over to them, TMUS still has the best valued unlimited plan and I do not expect the stubborn management at VZ to react before it is too late. After all, VZ was the last to bring back unlimited data and only caved in because the number of customers lost was too much to be ignored.Some people will argue that VZ provides much better coverage and faster speeds. That is simply not true, it was true in the past but not anymore. The difference is now barely noticeable.Chart(s) Source3G speeds for TMUS beats VZ 3G speeds while VZ narrowly edges out a lead in 4G speed. TMUS has a 4G speed of 16.65 Mbps while VZ has a speed of 16.89 Mbps, this is a very small difference. Overall coverage for VZ also narrowly beats TMUS clocking in at 88.17 percent, TMUS has a overall coverage of 88.60. These numbers are all from OpenSignal and it's independent testing. It should be noted that these numbers do not take into account the latest expansion in spectrum by TMUS.Diagram SourceRecently on April 17th, TMUS announced a huge expansion in low band spectrum. TMUS is doing this to reach more rural customers and to also help their building penetration in urban areas. This is an aggressive move by TMUS and will put immense pressure onto other carriers to also expand their LTE networks. As the LTE network for TMUS continues to expand and get faster, it will continue to steal customers away from VZ and other carriers.VZ has had a fall from grace, they are no longer the titan and leader of the carrier industry. Their customer base, along with many other carriers, are slowly being gobbled up by TMUS. The recent quarter numbers from VZ show this. I expect that TMUS will beat earnings expectations again this Monday."

The company reports earnings this week.","Will the AT&T-Time Warner Deal Go Through?Obviously, Monday's blockbuster announcement comes from AT&T (NYSE:T) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), after the former announced it will buy the latter for $85.4 billion.The deal is for a $107.50 per share of Time Warner, half in cash, half in stock. ""The deal is expected to be accretive in year one to T's adjusted EPS and free cash flow, and improve the dividend coverage. The company sees $1B in annual run rate cost synergies within three years of closing.""For the dividend's part, the company raised its payout by 2.1%, and this came along with the announcement that AT&T reported in-line EPS results and missed on revenues.Whew, that's a lot of info to digest.On Friday, we wrote about the potential for this deal and raised two points: one being whether regulators would approve the deal, and the other asking how the heck AT&T would pay for this.Well, we got our answer on both points. By going half-cash, half-stock, the company is looking to reduce its total bill. At least, in pure dollar form. What other choice did it have, though? There's no way it could take $200 billion in debt without suffering some kind of repercussion for it - although $170 billion still raises some flags.Of course, both political parties have chimed in on the matter, but it remains to be seen if anything will be done about it.So What Does That Leave Us With?On the plus side, AT&T is a magnificently great company. It has content, distribution, cell service, you name it. That's the good part. The bad part, of course, is the debt. Moody's has already put the company on review, and there's reason to be concerned.And what about the stock? It's not surprising to see shares sink by another 1.7% on Monday. Shares are now down more than 6% over the past three days and more than 10% over the past month.While that may not seem like much, it certainly is for a stock that's not known for volatility. It's now down about 16% from its 52-week highs and yields 5.2%.My thoughts are that when a rate increase from the Federal Reserve appears more and more likely, yield-centric stocks like AT&T will come under pressure. So if the rate hike talk suggests a December rate hike, I would expect AT&T to move lower into that announcement and possibly bottom within a few days.If it doesn't move lower into the event, I expect it to move lower following the announcement. Between higher interest rates and concerns about the debt, shares could be further pressured.That's not to say in a few years investors will be disappointed for having bought today. A yield near 5.5-5.6%, though, has typically represented a good buying opportunity. Hopefully, this time is similar.While One Titan Struggles, a Smaller Player Gains GroundBeing somewhat overlooked today are AT&T's earnings. Not much of a surprise, given the company's some $85 billion deal. However, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) also reported earnings.The company beat on EPS expectations and missed on revenue expectations, although sales did grow more than 17% YoY. T-Mobile added 851,000 net postpaid and 684,000 prepaid subscribers, leading the Big Four this quarter.It now sports a $38 billion market cap, and the stock is at new 52-week highs. Still, some people have big visions for the company, and perhaps no one has higher expectations than CEO John Legere.Check out the video above, but here's a notable line: ""They're going to be very distracted [AT&T]... Within 5 years [T-Mobile] will be a bigger wireless company than they are.""Can T-Mobile really take over AT&T? Man, it seems sort of far fetched, considering that earlier this summer, T-Mobile's 63.3 million total subs lagged both AT&T's 128.6 million and Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) 140.1 million subs.So in five years, essentially T-Mobile would need to double its subscriber base, while AT&T generates stagnant growth. That's putting it simply, because both can grow and T-Mobile can still overtake AT&T, but the point is the same: it's got a long way to go.I don't have anything against T-Mobile or Legere. In fact, I've been considering switching to its service. Its growth is great, but I'm not sure the company can overthrow AT&T in the next five years.While We're Talkin' 'Bout MergersWe still haven't heard much in the way of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). On Friday, NXP and Qualcomm reportedly agreed on a deal at $110 per share.Given that news, it's surprising it's not included in this mega-merger Monday. However, the ~$40 billion deal is disappointing to a number of shareholders.Admittedly, I am not an NXP shareholder, but even I was a little surprised at such a ""low deal,"" if we want to call it that. Just last year, the stock was over that figure, topping out around $115, and it still has a lot of catalysts.Again, this is all based on the reported figure of $110. Obviously, investors are still hesitant, with the stock about 10% below that level. But still, I personally feel that NXPI would have gotten to $110 on its own within 12-18 months, barring a marketwide pullback.So I'm curious to see whether management accepted an offer for that figure (although the $110 figure would be about a 30% premium to the ~$85 stock price NXP was hovering around before Qualcomm's interest was announced).Maybe some are pleased with the deal, but I think NXP should be worth more or would have gotten there on its own.Amazon, Amazon, Amazon (x1,000)It once seemed that the $1,000 price target was a sort of ""kiss of death"" analyst move. With Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) primed to reported earnings later this week - sorry, I couldn't help the pun! - perhaps it is rather ominous. But at least these analysts are in good company.Goldman Sachs is the latest to slap a four-digit price target on the e-commerce juggernaut, with its new $1,050 target, up from $920. It joins Credit Suisse, Cantor Fitzgerald, JPMorgan, RBC and Evercore ISI.So a half-dozen analysts think Amazon is headed north of $1,000, presumably in the next 12 months. Do you?Man, it would be a hell of a rally. The stock would need to tack on another 20% in order to get the stock price to the mark. But with the way things are going right now, it's hard to image Amazon not getting there.This week's earnings will likely be the make or break catalyst for its run, at least over the next few months. It's hard to buy a stock pressing its 52-week highs, with a big valuation and a $400 billion market cap. But a pullback will eventually happen. Considering that the stock was below $500 in February - up a massive 72% since then! - investors can surely find a better buying opportunity, no matter how much we love Amazon."

The old ""ceiling"" of 20k is now the new floor. What was once resistance is now support.Where the market goes from here depends upon earnings. S&P 500 earnings have been growing ever since 2009 and the market has been hitting new all-time highs all along the way.I covered my earnings projections for this year and next year, and my current target price for the S&P 500 in my feature article two weeks ago. I will update my numbers as usual in this week's newsletter.I have been saying for many weeks now that the market would eventually break out of the five week consolidation that it went into after the initial Trump victory rally. Boy, did it break out this past week! I will be covering this past week extensively a bit later in this week's newsletter.But, first I want to cover one of my favorites stocks at the current time. It is a fairly new buy in my Premier Growth Portfolio. In last week's feature article I featured Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), it had a pretty good week this past week.Here was the favorite comment from that article after it was published on Seeking Alpha:Let's see, no earnings currently, just projected, rsi is over 69, the market is at a relative high, the stock is roughly at an all time high, they are in Singapore, and we may be seeing a trade war. What could go wrong?Hey, I guess this guy does not agree with me! That's okay though, that is what makes a market. For every buyer there has to be a seller.We will see how many darts are thrown at me this week when I publish my latest article. Some people are just permanent dart-throwers though. They never have any ideas of their own, but they love to shoot down everyone else's ideas.Get your darts ready, here comes another one of my favorite stocks at the current time.I have chosen to write about T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), the un-carrier, this week. There are an awful lot of criteria that have to be meet before I purchase a stock. TMUS currently meets all of them.I am now entering my third decade as a professional money manager, and I have to admit that I have gotten pickier and pickier over the years. There is obviously still no guarantee that a stock purchase will work out, however.Data from BestStocksNowApp.comT-Mobile is a $52.2 billion dollar market cap company that is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington where my national radio show is heard daily on 1300 KKOL AM at 7am. The company provides unlimited digital wireless broadband voice and data services to subscribers in U.S. markets.Now, let's get back to the criteria that have to line up for me before I purchase a stock.First, I have to bullish on the stock market. I put out a buy signal in the market back in late march of 2009, and I have kept that buy signal in place ever since. My biggest reason for keeping that buy signal in place has been the growth in S&P 500 earning since that time. Here is what that growth in earnings chart currently looks like.As you can see from the chart above, just as earnings led the market lower back in 2008-2009, earnings have led the market higher since they bottomed in 2009. Furthermore, after a leveling off in earnings over the last two years, analysts are looking for a BREAKOUT in earnings this year and next year.In addition to this, if President Trump's pro-growth measures are put into place, there is upside to those current earnings expectations. Here come the dart throwers. I can hear your footsteps. That's okay, go ahead, I can take it.GDP for the most recent quarter came in at a paltry 1.9%, while economic growth is grinding to a halt after monetary policy alone got us an average of about 2%-2.5% over the last several years.While the economy has been growing at a sub-par rate, entitlements, on the other hand have been growing by a much higher rate of about 9%. Something has to give soon or we will go down the road that Greece went down. I don't think that our retirees and pensioners want that to happen.The current bottom line on the market is this: earnings growth and future expectations can continue to drive this market higher. The market is not cheap, but it also is not over-priced. The current forward PE of the S&P 500 is currently 17.2X. This is one-half the PE ratio of the irrational exuberance days in the late nineties. Here come more darts toward me, I can hear them now.I have had my share of darts and insults flung at me ever since I put out my BUY SIGNAL on the market back in March of 2009. The dart-throwers have been wrong. The dollar has not collapsed yet, and gold has not hit $5,000 per ounce yet. Instead the dollar is stronger than it has been in many years, and the Dow is at 20,000. I was right, and the bears were wrong. I don't say this in a braggadocios kind of way, but it is a fact.What about now, however? Can the bull make it to its eight anniversary this March and continue on it merry way?That was the subject of my December 29 th article. I have been right so far in 2017 also. This was my favorite comment from that bullish article:camanoComments (79) |+ Follow |Send MessageLOL After deregulation of financial institutions, etc, by Trump and his irrational behavior as a President, it is about time for another financial crisis and scandals. (we have them every 10 years)In about 10 to 16 month, after initial irrational Trumpsters euphoria, watch for significant market decline.Don't think you will be happy with new POTUS in a year or twoI don't think that this guy has much faith in Trump. He is as typical dart thrower. They love to use the expression ""LOL."" This seems to be one of the favorite expressions of nay-sayers these days.So suffice it to say that I still like the U.S. stock market. I prefer the stock market right now over any other asset class out there. I will explain why in this week's newsletter. I have stated many times that I would avoid bonds like the plague. We are now in a rising interest rate environment. That is not good for the bond market, or the traditional asset allocation model...I also prefer to invest in stocks in leading sectors of the market. The Telecom sector has been one of the leading sectors in the market so far in 2017. T-Mobile is obviously a member of the Telecom Sector.Next, I like stocks that make sense from a valuation proposition:Data from BestStocksNowApp.comT-Mobile may seem expensive with a forward PE ratio of 34.6X, but you have to compare that with its expected average annual earnings growth rate of almost 28% per year. This makes for a fairly reasonable PEG ratio of 1.24.Furthermore, when I extrapolate out T-Mobile's earnings over the next five years and then apply a multiple that I think is appropriate for stock like this, I come with a five year price-target of $100 per share. The stock closed Friday at $62.42.I also believe that there is upside potential to this target price if T-Mobile and Sprint (NYSE:S) were ever allowed to combine forces. There could also be other beneficial partners for the un-carrier.In addition to valuation, I also like stocks that are performing, both on an actual and relative basis. I have seen too many value traps over the years. What is wrong with combining value with performance?Let's take a look at the performance of the shares.Data from BestStocksNowApp.comOver the last five years the stock has almost tripled the performance of the S&P 500. Ditto for the last three years. Over the last twelve months the stock has once again, almost triple the performance of the S&P 500. Sounds like the un-carrier has delivered a lot of alpha to it investors over the years.My proprietary ranking system combines value and performance along with relative safety and the technical pattern. I don't like value by itself, nor do I like momentum by itself. I also don't like using a technical pattern only. I like to combine them all. T-Mobile also has a very strong technical pattern. The stock had a massive breakout this past week.When I combine all of the above criteria, I come up with a proprietary ranking of 93 out of 4,188 stocks, mutual funds, and exchange traded funds. I also currently have a position in it, at my money management firm.Data from BestStocksNowApp.com"
4064987,103048,2017-04-25T13:15:03-04:00,"T-Mobile reported their 2nd quarter earnings on the 24th.T-Mobile reported EPS of $0.38 vs. analyst expectations of $0.35 (EPS is adjusted for pretax gains and non recurring gains).Revenue was reported to be $9.6 billion, falling slightly below analyst expectations of $9.62 billion.Total net customer additions remained strong at 1.1 million in the first quarter, the highest growth in the industry.T-Mobile raised full-year guidance for postpaid net additions from the 2.4-3.4 million range to the 2.8-3.5 million range.","T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported mixed first quarter earnings on the 24th with a beat in EPS and a slight miss on revenue. TMUS reported an EPS of $0.38 (adj) beating analyst expectations of $0.35. Revenue was reported to be $9.6 billion, falling slightly short of analyst expectations of $9.62 billion. TMUS also reported total net customer additions of 1.1 million customers versus analyst expectations of 1.2 million customers for this quarter. In my opinion, this quarter was still extremely strong even if revenue did fall below analyst expectations.Verizon (NYSE:VZ) shareholders wish they had the same earnings which TMUS reported. In my earlier article comparing VZ and TMUS, I mentioned how TMUS was a better buy. After comparing the first-quarter earnings by both companies which were reported, my conviction remains that TMUS is simply the better company. If we look at the numbers TMUS comes out on top. TMUS is currently the industry leader in total number of customers added clocking in at 1.1 million for this quarter, The 16th consecutive quarter where they have added over a million customers. TMUS also posted that they had 798,000 postpaid net additions with themselves calculating that they captured around 250 percent of the growth for the industry. VZ did not even have postpaid customer additions, they had a net loss of over 307,000 postpaid customers. Total revenue for TMUS increased by 11 percent this quarter, while VZ reported a 5.1 percent decline in quarterly revenue in their first-quarter report. TMUS even raised yearly guidance, branded postpaid net additions increased from 2.4-3.4 million to 2.8-3.5 million for the yearly outlook of 2017. Them raising guidance is indicative that management is confident in their postpaid net additions for the year and that they will be able to continue to steal customers from VZ.TMUS data by YChartsNot only is TMUS stealing customers from VZ and other carriers, but they are retaining them as well. Churn (customer defections) was reported to be 1.18 percent vs. analyst expectations of 1.27 percent. Their loyalty program and strong deals have driven down churn very well, dropping the rate far below analyst expectations.TMUS also recently spent 8 billion in a low band spectrum auction, capturing around 45 percent of the spectrum offered. They increased their overall spectrum coverage by around 39 percent. Now TMUS has around 3x as much low band spectrum per postpaid customer as VZ. This spectrum covers every single inch of the United States, it will help them to become even more competitive against VZ and other carriers for customers. It also sets up a strong foundation for the upcoming 5G cycle upgrade which is expected.There is also speculation about potential mergers in the industry. It has been over a year since carrier companies were allowed to talk about mergers because of the spectrum auction. Carriers were banned from talking to each other about mergers during the spectrum due to regulatory laws; the merger ban will be lifted on the 27th. TMUS has said that they are open to talks about potential mergers to help accelerate growth and provide a better experience to customers. With TMUS as the industry leader in growth, I imagine that they have leverage in any sort of merger deal if it happens.I think that it is wise to load up on TMUS on any potential dips from the first-quarter earnings which was due to the slight revenue miss. If you dig deeper beyond the revenue miss, you will see that TMUS probably has the best potential for growth in the industry. With their stock trading near all-time highs, I expect some sort of pullback within the coming days. However, my long-term view on TMUS remains unchanged, I think that they have an amazing potential for growth and first-quarter results reflect this potential."
4000387,26891,2016-08-17T18:18:01-04:00,"Cisco beat on earnings per share and revenue expectations, while also announcing a layoff of 5,500 employees.Netflix and Enseo expand their partnership, bringing Netflix to more hotels around the world.Sprint and T-Mobile merger interests briefly rekindle. Where there's smoke, there's fire?Pinterest gets into video advertising.","Cisco Plans to Cut Jobs, but Less Than Previously ExpectedIt was earlier reported that Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) may plan to lay off roughly 20% of its workforce, or approximately 14,000 employees, as it looks to slash its costs by 15%. According to the company, though, it will slash ""just"" 5,500 jobs, as it looks to shift away from hardware and put more of an emphasis on software. Competitive pressure is likely helping with the decision too, as Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) continues to build momentum.Cisco's move isn't unfamiliar in the old-line tech world. In fact, others like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have made similar maneuvers. Moving resources away from their bread-and-butter businesses, the two tech companies have found a groove in higher margin businesses that have helped pushed the stock prices higher over the past few years.Will it be the same for Cisco? Only time will tell. But given that the tech world is/has been gearing up for continued strength in connectivity, Internet of Things and improved connections, one would think Cisco will play some sort of role in the revolution.In either regard - whether Cisco partakes in the changes or not - one can only assume that it will not happen quickly. These types of situations tend to take time and unfortunately, they're not uncommon in the sector. That's somewhat surprising, given that companies like Cisco usually have plenty of cash and little reason to not be on the forefront of new technologies.In any regard, while the stock is down on the news, it did just hit a new 52-week high earlier this week. A move to higher margin products shouldn't be too frowned upon either.Investors should get more insight given that the company reported earnings on Wednesday after the close. For what it's worth, Cisco topped earnings per share and revenue expectations.Netflix to Be More Widely Available in HotelsNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) already had a deal in place in Enseo to incorporate the video-streaming service in a number of different hotels. On Wednesday, Netflix and Enseo, ""an in-room entertainment systems integrator"" that provides an entertainment platform for hotel chains, announced they are expanding that relationship.How's it work? So Enseo is used by hotels to provide better entertainment options to its guests, rather than just a few dozen TV channels. Enseo's platform includes programs like Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and more. When a guest stays in the room, they simply log in with their Netflix credentials and are automatically logged out upon checkout.Why use Netflix on the hotel TV, rather than an iPad or laptop? For hotels that don't provide complimentary Wi-Fi, the on-TV format would be nice to have - especially given that hotel's don't charge to use it. Instead, the hotel benefits because now its guests aren't bogging down the Wi-Fi by streaming. Some would call it a win-win.Netflix and Enseo began working together in 2014, but with the latest deal, the latter can now ""offer Netflix to any hotel under a contract in any country worldwide where Netflix is available,"" according to TechCrunch. At current count, Netflix is available in only a few hundred hotels in the U.S., but that's expected to grow (both domestically and abroad) now that Enseo can expand beyond pre-approved hotel brands.It's hard to think this would be a negative catalyst for Netflix, seeing as though it's just one more way for the service to be front and center with its customers. In fact, according to Enseo, Netflix is the top-used service on its platform, so clearly the demand is there.From the surface, this seems like the rare win-win-win-win scenario. The customer, hotel, Enseo and Netflix come away with a W.Sprint and T-Mobile Merger?Shares of the telecom companies moved higher, albeit very briefly, on renewed interests in a possible merger between Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS).According to reports, SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY), a majority owner in Sprint, is ""holding out hope"" that the two companies will be able to pull it off. However, concerns linger about the current administration allowing such a deal to pass, given that it has prevented several notable M&A deals, (such as Allergan (NYSE:AGN)/Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL)/Baker Hughes (BHI)).Would T-Mobile even want to take on Sprint? If it did, would it pass the government's approval?Those are some of the questions. Reportedly, SoftBank may consider making another merger run with T-Mobile if they believe the ""new head of the FCC is amendable.""As for T-Mobile, there are questions as to whether it will want to get into bed with Sprint, which has experienced some balance sheet woes in the not-too-distant past. However, Sprint did show a healthy rebound in subs last quarter, which even outpaced some of its larger peers. Teaming up together, assuming the financials made sense, could create a big enough contender to go toe-to-toe with juggernauts like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ).Where there's smoke, there's fire?Welcome to the Big Leagues, Pinterest!That's sort of a teaser on its IPO potential which could come later this year or in 2017, but Pinterest (PINIT) is joining in on a different league: video.The company will start selling video advertising in an attempt to catch up to companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which have enjoyed the benefits of video for a while now.Pinterest's head of sales, Jon Kaplan, who was hired from Google, admitted that the company has ""under-invested"" in it so far. But there will be time to turn things around, especially given that Facebook expects video to be such an enormous market over the next five years.It also bodes well for Pinterest that the company is still private, giving it more flexibility and less scrutiny, as Wall Street doesn't hawk and critique its every move.Instead, the company has been working on things like search and creating forms of e-commerce, allowing users to buy right from its platform. Video ""pins"" are growing quickly on Pinterest and soon the company hopes it will allow users to upload their own.I always thought Pinterest had one of the best potentials. Not to say more so than Facebook per se (based on pure user size), but it has such easy advertising potential.For instance, when you go on the app it's loaded with nicely decorated rooms, unique furniture or crafts, and perfect food dishes. These could easily be ads from companies like Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), Restoration Hardware (NYSE:RH) and even Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). I would imagine engagement would be relatively high as well.Whether the ads command the pricing power that will impress investors is unclear, but the potential is there. With the addition of video growth and video advertising, investors may gobble up a Pinterest IPO if the price is right.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Twitter's shares stumble following a downgrade.","T-Mobile Announces New Plan, Sprint Snags SpotlightDespite the rumor mill continuing to churn, it may be a bit premature to call for a merger between Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). And there's a number of reasons why it would never materialize, although that didn't stop the stocks from momentarily spiking on Wednesday as a result.But on Thursday, the spotlight remained fixated on the carriers, but for a different reason than M&A.T-Mobile hosted a surprise conference call today, unveiling its ""Un-carrier 12"" plan, featuring a $70 unlimited data plan for customers' first line. A second line can be added for $50 and additional lines can be added for $20 each. However, the company's move with tablets is what could really get users excited: an unlimited plan for just $20 per month per tablet.Talk about a deal. Unlimited data on your tablet for just $20! I may even indulge in that. However, Sprint isn't letting T-Mobile have the spotlight all to itself. Instead, Sprint announced its own ""Unlimited Freedom"" plan on the same day, which includes unlimited talk, text and data for $60 per month. The price for two lines is $100 - both cheaper than T-Mobile.So not only is the company trying to share (steal?) the spotlight, it's also undercutting T-Mobile. From Jason Aycock's news update:I'm sure the move really makes T-Mobile CEO John Legere want to merge, huh?Don't Forget About Uber in the Self-Driving Car WarThe self-driving car discussion comes in waves; sometimes it's talked about every day, at others times just throughout the week or month. But the water never recedes. Self-driving cars, at least from a discussion standpoint, aren't going anywhere.This week in particular has been a week of high tide, with Ford (NYSE:F) upping its investment in Silicon Valley and even teaming up with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) on a tidy $150 million joint investment, and after Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMPY) hinted that it could up its collaborate with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on its self-driving initiatives.Uber (NYSE:UBER) is in on the movement too, as we've already known. However, we're finally getting an update on its moves now. First Uber is acquiring Otto, a company that makes its own lidar sensors and is working on self-driving modifications aimed at the trucking market. From Otto:However, Uber isn't just buying Otto. The company is also teaming up with Volvo (OTCPK:VOLVY) to bring self-driving cars to Pittsburgh - as soon as this month! The company will apparently deploy about 100 vehicles, each with an engineer (to drive in case something goes wrong) and another passenger who will be there for observations. Riders who draw the autonomous ride will ride fare-free as well.Rather than developing its own self-driving cars, Uber will use Otto for its autonomous needs.The Pittsburgh testing is impressive, even if Uber at the moment isn't considered the leader in autonomous driving. It's meaningful too, because while some companies like Google are considered leaders in the space, they can't maneuver as quickly as companies like Uber or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). These companies have both the technology and the platform to distribute their updates. For now, Google is making progress, but doesn't have an easy way to deploy it in the real world. Will Tesla and Uber lead the self-driving car revolution?Separately, one analyst suggests Uber is only worth $28.5 billion, not $62.5 billion, which it was valued at during its last funding round.Check out:The Ride Sharing Business: Is A Bar Mitzvah Moment Approaching?Ford Accelerates Fully Autonomous Vehicle Time-Table With Its 2021 Target DateSamsung Hits New Highs on Continued Momentum1,500,000 won has acted as significant resistance to Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), at least when it comes to the stock exchanges in South Korea. However, the stock was able to burst over that level, climbing almost 5% to 1,640,000 won on Thursday.The move wasn't just a new annual high, but a new all-time as well. So what drove the gains? The company exceeded earnings expectations in late-July, as smartphone gains trended higher, something Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hasn't been about to boast about much this year.Previously, we detailed the company's new smartphone initiatives and questioned whether Samsung would be able to take significant market share from its toughest competitor and its iPhone. An excerpt from that article read:While the gains seem to be boosting the stock a little late, keep in mind shares are up more than 30% on the year now. It's been a trend higher, as investors are cheering its ability to grow smartphone sales while others struggle in the current environment. Overall, smartphone sales are expected to barely grow this year, making market sure all the more important. Of course, Samsung is able to edge Apple, volume-wise, thanks to its lower pricing points (and thus lower margins).However, its premium lineup is what investors will stay focused on, especially when Apple introduces its new phones in September. Will the Cupertino giant post a smartphone resurgence, or will consumers be underwhelmed by the new devices?Check out:Apple: Just When Things Seemed Better, They're Set To Get WorseChina's Smartphone Market: Huawei Hits Brakes, Apple Tumbles In Q2Twitter's Shares Struggle Amid DowngradeTwitter (NYSE:TWTR) had several announcements today: The company suspended 235,000 accounts for violating terrorism policies, it announced new features to control and filter notifications, and finally Evercore ISI lit the stock up with a downgrade (Or has it burned it down? Regardless…).Either investors don't care for the new features, booed the terrorist ban or let the downgrade get to them, as shares fell 6% on the day. I'm going to guess it's door number three.The analyst says he sees ""more risk than reward"" and fears competitive advertising pressure will come from Snapchat (CHAT). That's legit. It caused him to downgrade the stock to sell from hold and lower his price target.So just a simple downgrade knocked the stock down that much? It was certainly a catalyst, or so it would appear. The stock is down 10% over the past three days, but it's been on quite a tear before that. Shares are up more than 30% over the past three months and had climbed from the low $16s to more than $21 at one point this week.While the company has been busy at work adding new streaming deals and features, the most recent earnings report disappointed investors, as Twitter's management slashed revenue guidance for the next quarter and continued to see its team members depart.However, rumors at the beginning of the month that the company may be bought out ignited the stock higher. Perhaps the ""momo"" traders who were in this for a hot buck traded out over the past few days. Or are at least giving it a rest as shares have been mighty strong over the past few weeks and with the exception of its earnings dip past few months as well.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

An increasingly bullish consensus has emerged in the market, and I can no longer deny it. While I still don't quite know how they did it, CEO John Legere and his team seem to have created a truly ""data-strong"" network, capable of delivering top performance even as subscribers get to enjoy unlimited video and music streaming.What's Left To Say?I must confess to still having lingering doubts, which I've already explained at length, but I still wanted to write on T-Mobile for two reasons. First, I was wrong, and everyone who said so six months ago deserves to hear me say it. So here it is again: I was wrong.The second reason, though, is more practical. It has been a while since I wrote about T-Mobile, and while my track record doesn't really inspire confidence, I wanted to take another shot at developing a framework through which investors can judge the risks and rewards of a T-Mobile investment. The core of my bear thesis was that the network couldn't handle the strain of Binge On and unlimited video streaming. If you take that out and assume somehow it can, what is left? Are there any other significant risk factors? How high can the stock go if they keep this up?Market Leading ForceT-Mobile is due to unveil its next Un-Carrier initiative, Un-Carrier 13, tomorrow on January 5th. It may well have happened by the time you read this. The Un-Carrier remains the most disruptive force in wireless, increasingly setting the standards which other carriers must either meet or see their subscribers bolt. Some recent speed bumps have not changed this.T-Mobile's Un-Carrier 12 initiative, the T-Mobile ONE Unlimited data plan for every subscriber, has probably come under more fire than any other initiative, even the zero-metered streaming offers of Un-Carrier 6 and 10. It was the worst-received of all the Un-Carrier moves by its own customers. They had sometimes greeted previous moves with yawns, but never with screams. Top complaints included the loss of high-speed tethering data, mandatory throttling of video content with no HD option, and the $20 hike in price of the cheapest plan.Later, T-Mobile made tweaks to the offer to make it more consumer friendly, adding HD options and tethering. But as it did so new complaints arose that T-Mobile was sacrificing the simplicity of the offer as fine print, exceptions, qualifications and surcharges multiplied with each revision. In fact, T-Mobile's new plans now have even more terms and conditions than the old ones, which really lived up to their billing as Simple Choice plans.T-Mobile is doubtless hoping to get a more positive reaction out of the gate this time, but there is little evidence of any permanent damage to its consumer cred. The speed with which Legere moved to address the complaints certainly helped, as did the fact that no one else in the wireless space is really innovating like T-Mobile right now. Customers didn't like the initial offering, but after Legere upgraded the new ONE plan subscriber growth actually accelerated over the old Simple Choice plans, and more than 80% of those new customers elected ONE even though T-Mobile continued to offer Simple Choice to those who wanted it.So T-Mobile's brand strength appears intact. It continues to draw subscribers from AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in large numbers. Sprint (NYSE:S) has fared somewhat better lately, and is even starting to peel subscribers away from the Big Two themselves. But there is no indication so far that their growth is coming at the expense of T-Mobile. Instead both of them seem to be growing at the expense of AT&T and Verizon, and I would expect that to continue.The Value Of A SubscriberThis brings the question of how much those new subscribers are worth. It's important to remember the inherently leveraged nature of a wireless carrier. In 2015, T-Mobile tripled its annual net income while subscribers grew ""only"" 8.3 million, 13%, in that same year. Obviously as the base gets bigger that will tail off somewhat. But net income gains will remain far outsized proportionally to total subscribers, which are still growing in double digit percentages.One remarkable thing about T-Mobile is how steady growth has been. Its 8.3 million net subscriber additions in 2015 were exactly identical to the 8.3 million it added in 2014, and 2016 numbers should also come in somewhere around there. Net income and free cash flow growth has been similarly steady. In its most recent quarter, 3Q2016, net income came to $366 million, $228 million higher than 2015. 2015's $138 million, in turn, was $232 million higher than 3Q2014's $94 million loss.Full year numbers also show a similar picture. 2014 net income of $247 million rose to $733 million in 2015, and current net income is reported at $1.3 billion. 2015's $486 million improvement is a little smaller than the $567 million in the first nine months of this year, but two factors explain that. First, as I have noted before, T-Mobile reported a large one-off $636 million non-operating gain in 1Q2016 owing to a spectrum deal it consummated with Verizon. While some spectrum gains are normal, this one was abnormally large and somewhat skews the 2016 data.T-Mobile usually reports $100-$200 million per quarter of non-operating gains. Following its outsized gain, however, it reported a very rare non-operating loss for the next quarter. I believe this may reflect a ""claw-back"" of some gains, so averaging the two quarters puts the skew at about $250 million. That would put 2016 beneath 2015 growth. But the second factor, obviously, is that we don't have the 4Q2016 numbers yet, which will raise it back up, by about $200 million based on past quarters. That puts the underlying growth at $517 million in 2016.Altogether, T-Mobile has shown a consistent pattern of raising net income around $500 million on average in each of the last two years, with 8.3 million new customers each year. That means it is adding around $60 to annual net income per additional subscriber it adds.Earnings And Share PriceOn the downside, a lot of growth has already been priced into T-Mobile stock. Its P/E ratio currently stands at close to 37, down somewhat from earlier in the year but far above industry peers. AT&T's merger-augmented P/E is less than half that at 18. Verizon's P/E, which is far more comparable to T-Mobile since it lacks AT&T's new satellite and video production components, is an even lower 15.5. While T-Mobile's growth should continue, this number will presumably begin to level off moving forward.To project T-Mobile going forward, in the absence of network saturation we can assume continued steady state growth at this $60 per year profit per customer until it reaches AT&T/Verizon levels. If T-Mobile continues to add a little over 8 million customers per year, it would hit AT&T's current level of 133 million subscribers in early 2023, and Verizon's 143 million level in mid-2024. Where the stock is at that point depends on the subscriber count and also the P/E ratio.As you can see, the stock falls somewhere within a $94-$123 range, with the blended average summing to $108. Remember, the stock is currently trading around $59. So even accounting for some diminished P/E ratio, there could be a lot of growth left.Risk Factors Not So RiskyT-Mobile faces a number of risks, like any business, but most of the ones market analysts usually point to are, in my opinion, of little consequence. T-Mobile has only one real risk factor, as I said, network congestion. Some other commonly cited risk factors have meanwhile receded in importance.Network CoverageNetwork congestion and network coverage are often grouped together under ""network quality"" but they are different considerations. While T-Mobile's network congestion issues might be getting worse, network coverage problems are definitely getting better. Coverage is the ability to connect to the network from any geographic point, congestion affects how much data you can pull down once you are connected. Coverage is also important because it pertains to voice and text connections as well as data, meaning the ability to call for help in an emergency or make sure an important business note is received promptly.The difference in coverage quality between different carriers is rapidly diminishing. Verizon remains the leader, but the gap is narrowing rapidly. AT&T's network is now almost indistinguishable from T-Mobile's in quality. While Sprint emphasizes this more in its marketing than T-Mobile does, the convergence is at least as relevant to the latter, with its stronger brand and momentum. T-Mobile is also showing real leadership in network speeds, which routinely exceed its competitors. In fact, T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray has recently begun to dangle the prospect of 1-gigabit wireless speeds in T-Mobile's near future. While he didn't give a specific target date, he insists that T-Mobile will be the first to market with this feature.I see little danger network coverage will fail to continue to improve. T-Mobile's ownership of increasing shares of 700 MHz spectrum gives its radio towers propagation characteristics little different from those of AT&T or Verizon. T-Mobile network execution has been strong and progress should continue until the Big Three networks are virtually indistinguishable in terms of coverage.DIRECTV MergerDIRECTV Now is often considered a potential challenge to the broader wireless system since its data usage does not count against AT&T mobile data caps. That means that subscribers on other networks who choose to subscribe to it may want to leave their current carrier to take advantage of the zero-rating on AT&T's network.This is potentially a real problem for Verizon, the only carrier which does not offer some form of unlimited video streaming data. T-Mobile is unlikely to be affected much, however, as it recently announced that DIRECTV Now had joined its Binge On program, exempting it from data caps on its Simple Choice plans. And of course T-Mobile ONE subscribers have no reservations about staying with T-Mobile after subscribing to DTVNow, as they all receive unlimited data anyway.Almost no one on T-Mobile will see any degradation in their wireless experience, no matter how much data they burn on DIRECTV Now or any other video platform. So the impact of DIRECTV Now on T-Mobile is unlikely to be substantial even if uptake is high.ConclusionI am probably one of the last to have continued doubts about T-Mobile's ability to maintain network performance under this load. And my warnings about that have not been vindicated by events thus far. In the absence of such network problems, however, I do not see any other risk factors that pose a substantial risk to T-Mobile. If you believe the network can take it, you should be a buyer, even with the recent run up. But I re-iterate that I am still not totally convinced the network can take it."
4040455,89226,2017-01-29T15:57:12-05:00,"It's important to keep an eye on the debt level of T-Mobile as the company has effectively stacked its maturities over the next ten years.With $30 billion in long-term debt, this is no small burden to undertake.While the debt may seem sizeable, it's not overleveraged, especially on a relative basis.","I had a request from a commenter on a previous article to take a look at the debt of T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Keeping an eye on debt levels and the burden it represents on the company today is an absolutely critical aspect of investing that everyone needs to do. T-Mobile has been on a tear up over the last twelve months, returning 55.5% and making shareholders quite pleased. When companies do that well, usually analysts start looking to see if there's anything wrong with the company, as to determine the probability of a future uptrend. After taking a tough look at the debt, I can confidently say that there's nothing to worry about.Source: Seattle TimesThe Debt WallOne of the worst things a company can do itself is stack the maturities all in a row and not space them out over the very long term. That's essentially what T-Mobile has done, as starting in 2019, there are obligations of well over $1 billion every year through 2026. Of short-term debt, there's approximately $325 million due, while there's $30.1 billion in long-term debt (anything greater than 1 year).Source: BloombergNow, some inherent caveats to this debt wall is that there is no debt due this year and that the 2018 principal due is not material relative to cash flows. In Q3 2016, T-Mobile had $1.74 billion in OCF, which can be annualized to nearly $7 billion. Net of capex, the company is left with annualized free cash flow of close to $2.4 billion, which more than covers next year's maturity and the 2019 maturity. The debt due next year, in September, is the 5.25% $493 million senior unsecured notes, for which all of the principal is currently outstanding.What's quite interesting about this debt is the weighted average fixed coupon of 6.4%. That's high-yield, plain and simple. All of the debt is callable and for the most part, is rated BB by Standard & Poor's. That's below investment grade, just for the record. In fact, the proper term is ""non-investment grade speculative."" The outlook is stable. All of T-Mobile's debt currently trades at a premium, seen below.Source: BloombergT-Mobile also has a sizeable cash position, which is going to aid its credit multiples on a net debt basis. As of Q3 2016, the company has $5.4 billion in cash, although that is down from Q4 2015 when it had $7.5 billion.Are Peers In The Same Boat?Naturally, we'll look to AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to see how leveraged T-Mobile actually is. Before we look at the multiples, it's worth noting that AT&T and Verizon both have substantially higher debt levels than T-Mobile, as they should considering the sizes of these companies are both materially larger. In the short term, AT&T had $9.8 billion due in debt, with $113 billion due over the long term. Verizon has $2.6 billion in debt due in the short term, with $105 billion due over the long term.Source: Derived From BloombergFirst, from a debt/equity perspective, Verizon has the worst multiple. It is a debt capital focused company and it clearly shows that the magnitude of the debt dwarfs its current equity level. Generally, a multiple sub-1.0x is quality in this category, but I wouldn't say that T-Mobile is overleveraged on this basis at 1.7x. Jumping down to debt/free cash flow, it's important to note that Verizon reported negative free cash flow for Q4 2016. While I could have taken the LTM total, which would've been highly positive, I used the most recently reported quarter's FCF annualized instead. With that being said, debt/FCF shows that T-Mobile has a substantially lower amount of FCF than AT&T in this regard.The debt/total capitalization metric next gives us a better look at these companies, for which the same conclusion is true - Verizon has the most debt relative to equity and that T-Mobile isn't overleveraged from this standpoint. Perhaps more important are the net debt/EBITDA and EBIT figures, for which I can say that on a net debt/EBIT basis, it's overleveraged. While this figure is much lower than what it has had in previous year (north of 10x), it's still too high relative to peers. On a net debt/EBITDA basis, however, it's not at all over leveraged. It's 0.11x higher than Verizon and that's nothing in the grand scheme of things.Now, one particularly interesting thing I've been looking at, albeit for companies in the energy sector, is how much interest expense is taking away from the bottom line. Interest has to be paid every quarter (unless this company were to have PIKs, but that's not the case and would be highly unusual) and shareholders are often adamant that debt be reduced in order to see higher EPS levels, and, subsequently, higher dividend payouts. Obviously, T-Mobile doesn't pay out a dividend right now, even though it has the free cash flow to sustain a modest quarterly payout.ConclusionT-Mobile will report quarterly earnings on February 22. At that point, we'll receive updated information on cash flows and likely and updated outlook on debt paydown and/or future debt raises. For now, I don't see any reason to fear this company's debt toll, as while it creates a burden on its bottom line, the same can be said for competitors, so it's within the industry norm. Long story short, the debt doesn't pose an issue at this time."
4000806,95916,2016-08-19T04:52:10-04:00,"T-Mobile has defied my predictions for a Binge On network hangover.
        The network quality and speed is actually approaching Verizon's.
        The stock is up 20% since my sell recommendation.
        Its P/E remains elevated, even before excluding one-off earnings.
        I am not yet ready to abandon my thesis of network load and congestion.","IntroductionToday was a big day in wireless, as two major wireless provider CEOs literally opened a Twitter war over whose new unlimited data plan was better, presumably with the next price war not far behind. I intend to do a little more analysis before commenting on the effects of these plans on the companies. My primary focus will probably be Sprint (NYSE:S) but since T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) will undoubtedly be part of the discussion, I thought I should first update my analysis of the Un-Carrier's stock. You see, I have some egg on my face, and I wouldn't want readers to think I was trying to hide it.Recapping My CoverageAfter a prolonged period of bullishness on T-Mobile, I became a bear on November 10th, 2015, the day they announced Un-carrier X, Binge On. Although the move was widely hailed as another breakthrough by the Un-Carrier, I saw it as the beginning of a period of intense strain on the data network. I recommended selling T-Mobile shares, which had gained 115% since their IPO three years earlier, and re-investing in Sprint, which was severely undervalued.T-Mobile was trading at $38 at the time, where it had been for a few months. And for another few months it stayed in that narrow band, neither rising nor falling very far. I maintained my sell recommendation, even after T-Mobile hailed the success of Binge On in an article claiming network strain had actually gone down since the new zero-rating. As I explained at the time, a period of early success was to be expected regardless, since the downgrading of streaming video applied to existing data traffic as well as the new data traffic the program would produce. I saw the addition of YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to the program as a real test, since the benefits to the network of downgrading would be less and the utilization of YouTube had historically been higher than premium video services.But in the last ten weeks, the stock has been on a steady upward march, advancing more than 20% to almost $47 a share. T-Mobile is still seeing no network effects, with network quality that is coming closer and closer to matching Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) gold standard. Today, T-Mobile announced Un-Carrier 12. Beginning September 6th, the new T-Mobile One plan will offer unlimited, unthrottled 4G LTE data to every subscriber, with pricing beginning at $70, $25 cheaper than its current individual unlimited plan. Prices will drop from there, with the second line at $50 and subsequent lines at only $20 a month, for unlimited data with no throttling.So, is the network beyond any question now? Was I wrong about T-Mobile? Or was I just early?My Defense, Such As It IsTo simply clarify, I stated at the time that it would be difficult to time the exact moment network strain would really start to breakout, since zero-rating takes time to fully show up in consumer behavior. When T-Mobile launched Music Freedom in June 2014, it spent the next two years continually revising up how much music per subscriber was being consumed. As more subscribers learned about the feature, more people started taking advantage of it more frequently. I fully expected Binge On to take a similar course.And I also noted at the time that it was much to risky to short T-Mobile stock, which might (or might not) go up before it went down. So no one should have lost their shirt with an uncovered short because of my recommendation. I would also like to add that if you had to pick one, I was not wrong to say that Sprint was a better bet than T-Mobile. Sprint is up almost 90% since March, T-Mobile is up 20%.All that said, lets get the crow-eating out of the way.Without Further AdoYes, I fully expected that T-Mobile would be showing at least some signs of network strain by now, especially considering that they finally added YouTube to the service, the most popular mobile video service. Clearly, they are not. Anyone who followed my sell recommendation has missed out on a 20% gain over the past five months, a nice rate of return. Though again, if they put the resulting proceeds where I said, they did even better with the money.I give full credit to CTO Neville Ray and CEO John Legere for their extraordinary work. Clearly, they have added substantial data capacity on a limited capital budget, to a company that was little more than an auction item three years ago. Subscriber count is up more than 20 million since that time, network quality has improved, and even better is the cache of the brand. Once dismissed as an also-ran, T-Mobile now truly is the ""Un-Carrier,"" setting the standard in wireless which its competitors are then expected by consumers to meet. It is an immense achievement.Double Or Nothing?Although the primary thrust of my argument was technological, not financial, I also included in my last article an analysis of T-Mobile's financials. At the time, I noted that with a P/E ratio 3x AT&T's (NYSE:T) and 4x Verizon's, T-Mobile was already priced ""almost to perfection,"" or so I thought. Since then, its profits have gone up considerably. But even so, after this latest run up in the stock, the P/E ratio still stands at an imposing 35. And that's not all.Not all of that earnings growth that pulled the ratio down is pure cash flow. In 1Q2016, T-Mobile reported a one-time $636 million profit from a ""spectrum gain,"" owing to its latest round of spectrum deals with various parties. That gain is a one-time boost to the bottom line, not a steady stream of operating profit. Strip out the spectrum gain, and the P/E ratio is currently sitting at 56, up since my last report.I also still cannot quite bring myself to believe that network stress delayed is network stress denied. If Binge On is succeeding as well as it seems to be, that means that T-Mobile is probably attracting more video heavy subscribers in its last few quarters of amazing growth. While my predictions have not been vindicated yet, and that certainly casts some doubt on them, I just do not see how this video-heavy data approach can go on indefinitely, especially with all the growth in presumably video-heavy subscribers the stock seems to be pricing in. There simply must be an upper limit to this. And hitting it could substantially damage the consumer cred Legere has so painstakingly built.ConclusionT-Mobile has unquestionably shamed the naysayers, including me, with its blazing growth and powerful network. The performance of the network and the stock has been far in excess of anything I could have anticipated. But the high P/E ratio, and some lingering doubts about Binge On, still lead me to believe investors should tread lightly around the stock. Sprint remains the better bet."
4014406,22148,2016-10-24T20:53:33-04:00,"T-Mobile again leads the industry in subscriber growth.The company beat Q3 EPS forecasts, but the net income levels are meager in comparison to those of the wireless industry giants.The valuation remains stretched as investors are sucked into the momentum trade and not the reality of the results.","T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) again led the wireless industry with the crucial postpaid phone additions during Q3. The company again showed some catch on the bottom line to go along with the customer growth.The stock is up over 8% to new highs as the market welcomes the quarterly numbers. The question, of course, is whether anybody should chase the rally above $50 or even hold the stock up here.The big catch with the customer adds and service revenue growth is that the bottom line remains rather meager. When excluding one-time spectrum gains, T-Mobile only generated net income of $244. The number was only slightly up sequentially from the $225 million earned in Q2.The concern is that the third-largest wireless carrier is only earning around $250 million in profit per quarter. Industry giants like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) earn billions per quarter. These wireless giants could easily push T-Mobile back toward breakeven by cutting prices.The good news is that AT&T and Verizon are distracted with large content deals. CEO John Legere made the following statement to Bloomberg regarding the AT&T deal to purchase Time Warner (NYSE:TWX):The question is whether one wants to pay over $40 billion for T-Mobile on the theory that the competition will stay distracted. At some point, the strong competitors will look at this chart and figure out a plan to cut off the company's growth.Source: T-Mobile Q316 FactbookThe key investor takeaway is that the stock trades at 50x EPS estimates for the year. T-Mobile remains a difficult investment as investors chase the momentum in the stock as wireless gains on the lack of action by the giants in the sector.Until T-Mobile figures out how to gain customers from AT&T and Verizon in a more profitable manner, the investment risk remains high and dependent on the lack of a pricing war that is likely inevitable if T-Mobile continues gaining momentum."
3993090,83156,2016-07-29T04:07:01-04:00,"T-Mobile had an excellent quarter.
        Company continued to steal customers for rivals.
        Margins have room to expand.","Shares of T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) are trading at 52-week highs after the company reported a strong Q2 that sent the stock up 1.5%. Revenue increased 12.5% year-over-year, beating estimates by $170 million, and EPS came in at $0.25 (beating estimates by $0.05). Churn fell to a record low of 1.27%, and once again T-Mobile outpaced its competitors in subscriber growth. The company added 1.9 million net customers in the second quarter: 890,000 were branded postpaid subscribers, and 646,000 of these were the more lucrative branded postpaid phone subscribers. It marked the 10 th consecutive quarter of TMUS leading the industry in branded postpaid net adds, and management upgraded its subs guidance for the year. The company now expects branded postpaid net adds of 3.4-3.8 million, compared to the previous forecast of 3.2-3.6 million. We explore some of the reasons why TMUS has been able to generate stronger subscriber growth than its peers, and why we are optimistic that the firm can expand margins going forward.We think the weak US economy has been a driving force behind TMUS's ability to outpace rivals. High unemployment (after factoring in the near 30-year low labor force participation rate) and stagnating incomes have made customers more sensitive to price, and TMUS discounted plans more attractive relative to those of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). This has allowed TMUS to steal customers from competitors. 42% of T-Mobile's net phone adds in the first quarter came from competitors, compared to just 10% for AT&T and 14% for Verizon. Labor force participation is lowest among millennials, a demographic that uses smartphones more than any other. The majority of the job gains in recent quarters have gone to older workers, and younger demographics are leaving the workforce. Many of the individuals in these age brackets have poor job prospects and massive student loan obligations, and we expect that price will continue to be the deciding competitive factor going forward.Through customer growth, T-Mobile has expanded margins. Q2 adjusted EBITDA grew 36% year-over-year. Operating income, however, is the more important metric because it takes into account depreciation, which represents the cost of growing the network. TMUS has spent heavily to improve its network in recent quarters, and D&A as a percentage of revenues increased from 13% in Q215 to 17% in the latest quarter. Operating income did not grow as fast as EBITDA as a result, however the company still showed meaningful improvement thanks to positive operating leverage: adjusted operating margin increased from 7% last year to 8.3% in the latest quarter. As long as TMUS can continue to grow subscribers the company should be able to expand margins. Telecoms is a capital-intensive industry, so the firms with the strongest advantages are those that can spread their fixed costs across large revenue bases. T-Mobile lacks the scale of Verizon and AT&T, and this is the primary reason for the divergence in profit margins between the carriers (Figure 1).Figure 1: 5-Year Median Operating MarginsSource: MorningstarThere is room for margin upside if the company can continue to add subscribers, which would translate into higher service revenues and greater fixed cost leverage.Conclusion:T-Mobile continued to take share against rivals and had an excellent quarter overall. We think the factors that are allowing TMUS to do so, namely a weak US economy and low labor force participation, will persist, and that TMUS will continue to show strong subscriber growth in the next few quarters. This should allow T-Mobile to expand margins, especially if D&A and advertising costs moderate."
3992465,22148,2016-07-28T01:37:04-04:00,T-Mobile again reported sector-leading subscriber metrics during Q2.The wireless company saw no benefit to the bottom line from growing subscribers over the last year.The stock valuation is very strained based on the inability to grow income.,"T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) continues to report record headline numbers, but not so great bottom line numbers. The domestic wireless company has become a marketing machine, but the costs to gain customers and grow revenues doesn't exactly reward shareholders.The company again led the industry in post-paid phone additions that helped grow service revenues. At 12.1% service revenue growth, T-Mobile is actually outshining the sector by a mile where the other players are seeing losses.Source: T-Mobile Q216 investor factbookThe problem, though, is that an investment is only valuable if the growth in revenues exceeds the costs to add those additional revenue. While T-Mobile is making progress on some of the cost fronts such as cost of services and selling, general and administrative, the more hidden other costs like depreciation and interest expense are cutting into all of the potential profit gains.Similar to the rest of the industry, T-Mobile likes to point investors to the EBITDA metric, but this metric excludes these crucial parts of the investment theme. Depreciation is a massively important metric for wireless companies because that is where the cost of building the network hits the income statement. In addition, interest expenses are another place where the debt taken on to build the network and buy spectrum impacts the financials.In fact, the wireless company specifically blames interest expense for the flat to down Q2 net income. Not only did interest expense grow by $111 million over last Q2, but also the interest income decreased by $46 million. The net effect was a $157 million reduction to income.For this reason combined with soaring depreciation costs, the net income has made no improvement in the last year. Even the Q1 numbers had the benefit of a one-time gain that once excluded nearly wipes out all of the reported income for that quarter.Source: T-Mobile Q216 investor factbookThe key investor takeaway is that with the stock trading above $45 and earning only $0.25 in the last quarter, T-Mobile is an expensive stock. The market likes to focus on EBITDA numbers, but that is a dangerous way to invest in the wireless space where depreciation and interest expenses are huge keys to financial health.The recommendation is to continue admiring the marketing machine of the new CEO, but not so much the valuation of the stock."

A small minority of net neutrality proponents are consistently applying their own wrong-headed rule, but the majority have either misplaced their outrage or have conveniently retreated now that they see that a consistent application of the net neutrality rule would mean no free data offers.The grumblers are back at itIn an effort to piggyback on the immense popularity of Pokémon Go, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has decided to offer one year's worth of free cellular data just for the game. Now only constrained by their cellphone's battery life, Pokémon trainers would be able to walk all around their cities catching and hatching the creatures and putting them to the test in the Pokémon gyms to their heart's content.While most applauded T-Mobile for keeping up with the times and for the generous offer (even if it is a marketing scheme and not a pure gift), some weren't so appreciative. The grumblers say that T-Mobile's free data for Pokémon Go violates a net neutrality rule - that all data on the internet must be treated equally.The year-old net neutrality debateThe debate last year centered around scenarios like Internet service providers (ISPs) allegedly throttling some data because it was too demanding for their infrastructure. The question arose whether some internet giants like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) should be able to pay an extra fee to ISPs to stop throttling or even give their data a boost. The net neutrality proponents argued that ISPs should not throttle or charge different prices for different data.Mises.org writers were unfortunately in the minority by saying such a rule diminishes consumers' sovereignty in the market for data and data delivery to their devices. If consumers are willing to pay for high definition movies with little to no buffering time, and if such service requires strenuous use of the ISPs' infrastructure, then different prices emerge to help firms allocate resources to uses that best satisfy consumers' wishes.Why we can't have nice thingsNow, T-Mobile is offering the opposite. Instead of charging extra for something that is technologically demanding on their end, they are charging less for something that might get them more customers. And despite some complaints regarding data usage, the Pokémon Go app is average relative to other apps' data intensity. Some over-eager players may be running up a large bill just because they are playing it so much and not using Wi-Fi when possible.T-Mobile's prerogative to charge more for data is the same prerogative they have to charge less for data. At least some of the grumblers are consistent in the application of their net neutrality rule, even if their rule ultimately serves against their own interests.But the fact that there is not nearly as much outrage over T-Mobile's free data offer as there was last year when this debate was in full swing shows that public opinion on government policy is subject to severe cognitive biases.New government rules are applauded and then ignored, criticized and then demanded, and all by the same individuals who base their reactions on visceral and emotional impulses rather than logical and clear-headed consideration."
3990583,25562,2016-07-22T08:08:32-04:00,The telecom sector is deeply overbought here.A large portion of the appeal of the industry is the high dividend paid out by AT&T and Verizon.The article below will discuss my sell thesis on T-Mobile.,"The telecom sector continues to outperform the overall market as investors embrace what can be termed as risk off assets. The two largest entities in the space Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are highly prized for their above-average dividend, especially in today's yield starved marketplace. I have decided to sell my stake in T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) as will be outlined below.Fierce RallyThe market continues its strong run after the initial shock of Brexit. The fierce rally has pushed the SPY past prior resistance to a new all-time high. Barring a sudden sell-off, the index should mark a new all-time weekly high extinguishing a significant portion of the bears' thesis.The bears are not vanquished; they remain firmly in hibernation waiting for their chance to take the market down. With earnings season upon us, I suspect they will be given the opportunity to wreak havoc on individual names. Notice the RSI shown above; the index is closing in on the 70 number indicating the market is overbought here. It is often wise to avoid purchasing equities when the market is overbought; typically, a better opportunity will reveal itself.TelecomThe telecom sector remains a defensive industry with muted growth prospects. The largest players in the industry, T and VZ, return a significant portion of their free cash flow to investors via a quarterly dividend. The industry requires a consistent outlay of Capex to upgrade and maintain their networks often requiring copious amounts of debt. Take a look at the weekly chart below of the Vanguard Telecom Services ETF (NYSEARCA:VOX). The chart turned parabolic on the 14th of July, as the ETF is deeply overbought here. A flash alert was sent out to members of the Undervalued Gems Investment Service to take profits in TMUS. A brief review of the investment case for TMUS can be seen below.EBITDA GrowthTMUS remains a growth play in the telecom space as they continue to build out their network and gain share. The best metric to value TMUS is EBITDA growth, the table below courtesy of Finbox.io illustrates my fair value on TMUS. To see the full calculations used, click the hyperlink above. TMUS is assigned a WACC of 8.5% with an EBITDA exit value of 6.5 in line with historical values.EBITDA growth continues at a brisk pace, I have factored in flat margins through 2020, as interest rates will inevitably rise negatively impacting TMUS's ability to grow margins. Keep in mind, the telecom space requires continues Capex spend with frequent debt underwriting. For example, the ongoing spectrum auction will require a significant outlay of funds not to mention the eventual buildout of a 5G network.As shown above, my fair value target for TMUS is $46.80, not far off from its current trading price. In my view, the risk-reward set-up here is less than favorable, hence my decision to exit TMUS at $42.55 per share for a 17% gain in a less than six-month holding period. The funds are held in reserve awaiting the next opportunity.TMUS continues to perform superbly as it remains locked in a power struggle to gain share from the most entrenched players such as T and VZ. TMUS's consistent need to fund further Capex will likely preclude them from paying out a dividend at this time, further diminishing the investment appeal here. I might have been more inclined to hold the shares if a dividend was given to compensate for the time value of money. I do view TMUS as best in class under the colorful leadership of John Legere.Follow up on VOXPost my sell call on the industry, the VOX has sold off sharply in spite of a brisk rally in the major indexes. It seems some of the froth has come out of the industry here as money rotates out to chase other opportunities. As of the time of writing, T is slated to open up down roughly 1% post their in-line quarter. T's investment appeal remains its above average dividend, yet for dividend growth investors more appealing choices are available outside the telecom space. The primary challenge for T is to grow meaningfully their dividend, a feat that will remain increasingly difficult as the years progress. The move to purchase DirecTV will bolster cash flow in the short term; yet as additional customers flee the service, growth will dissipate.I prefer my dividend growth companies to operate in stable industries with a clear path to revenue and earnings growth. The ability to grow earnings will allow for significant hikes in the dividend on an ongoing basis. As detailed in my report, ""My top pick for 2017"" available to subscribers of the Undervalued Gems Investment Service, a golden opportunity is before us once again in an industry that's difficult to disrupt. The August issue will also detail a high yield play in the healthcare industry.

3970567,22148,2016-05-03T10:01:01-04:00,T-Mobile continues to lead the domestic wireless industry in net subscriber adds and service revenue growth.The company also leads the sector in operating expense growth.The stock isn't appealing at $40 with minimal ability to generate profits in the highly competitive wireless industry.,"As a brand and marketing machine, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has done a tremendous job of turning the business around. For shareholders, the question remains whether the wireless company can make the next step towards profitable growth.The stock traded up to the mid-$30s in early 2014 to only end up trading around $40 a couple of years later. One fundamental flaw continues to hold the stock back from seeing stock gains in correlation to subscriber additions.Focused On Subscriber GrowthThe marketing machine continues to attract new customers, but one has to wonder if the additions are due to cheap rates. For the quarter, T-Mobile added 877,000 branded postpaid phone net adds along with 2.2 million total net adds. The numbers are impressive considering AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) are both struggling to even add postpaid phone customers at this point in the cycle.The numbers clearly don't lie that T-Mobile is generating the highest revenue growth in the wireless sector. As the service revenue adds up from adding over 2 million net adds over most of the recent quarters, the other wireless carriers are struggling to even generate any growth.Source: T-Mobile Q1'16 Investor FactbookNo Focus On EarningsThe problem though is that the company isn't making a lot of progress on the bottom line. Excluding an after-tax gain of $0.46, T-Mobile only generated a Q1 EPS of $0.10. The number was down substantially from the $0.34 earned in the prior quarter.The CEO made the following statement in the earnings release that hints at the issue for the stock:The whole discussion was on the top line growth, but an income statement is made up of equally important expenses that off set revenues. All of the key expense items saw sizable growth during Q1, but the biggest problem is the SG&A line and the D&A line.Source: T-Mobile Q1'16 earnings releaseThe wireless industry likes to focus on EBITDA numbers, but a company doesn't generate value by not covering the cost of the network and leased equipment. In this case, depreciation costs were up $470 million YoY, but these numbers are true costs. The Q1 EBITDA number showed solid growth, but all of the growth is coming from a shift in how phone sales are accounted due to the lease program.The end result is that the EPS numbers for 2016 and 2017 continue to crash as expenses accelerate with the higher revenues. Roughly 90 days ago, analysts expected T-Mobile to earn $2.54 next year. The estimate has collapsed to $1.96 now with one analyst even forecasting a low of only $0.68.TakeawayThe key investor takeaway is that T-Mobile would be a must own stock if the investment equation was based solely on customer additions. Unfortunately though, the stock is stuck in the current range as the wireless company is only able to acquire customers at what appears breakeven levels."

The two companies, in a relatively hilarious Twitter exchange, announced competing unlimited data plans that are significantly lower priced than their current $95 per month charge.David Tovar, vice president of corporate communications for Sprint stated in a press release, ""We are always watching the competition to try and take something that appears popular and make it even better. That's what we have done here by offering a really compelling offer.""There are a variety of factors in each plan that you could use to argue over which plan is a better value, but the bottom line is that a family of four will pay $40 per line no matter the carrier. These options are extremely appealing to the telecommunication consumer who doesn't have any preferences regarding video-streaming quality.There are substantial differences in the two suppliers network coverage, with T-Mobile taking the upper hand in less-densely populated areas and suburbs. However, Sprint can be afforded for the average urban worker at a lower price. It will be very interesting to see how this competition shakes out when both data plans drop.Both Sprint and T-Mobile are in large strides to grab some of the market cap from Verizon and AT&T in the telecommunications industry. This latest effort by the two companies, which have been rumored to be in the works of a merger, shows how the smaller cap companies can compete within the industry. Hopefully, this will spur some price changes in how the major carriers continue their business.In Sprint's quarterly results, they claimed to have added 1730,000 contracts while T-Mobile added 890,000. Yet, Sprint appears to be more favorable to investors than T-Mobile. Both have very different metrics, most noted by the difference in P/E ratio.Source: Seeking AlphaSource: Seeking AlphaWhile both companies saw price drops, for the time being, it is almost certain to say that demand will shift in their favor if the larger carriers do not initiate any response.A large shift in price is expected when the bell rings Monday morning. Both companies have not ruled out a merger. As both companies are owned by larger brands, Sprint by SoftBank and T-Mobile by Deutsche Telekom, any profitable sale is always possible.TMUS has seen blazing growth. The stock is up 11.15% over the past 3 months and their unlimited data plan hopes to carry that momentum. Over that same period, however, Sprint is up 65.04% causing many to believe that Sprint has the upper hand. For me, it is too soon to tell.Stay tuned for a telecommunication market shift stemming from these two initiatives."

        Long-term bullish options positioning shows that institutional buyers think the stock is going higher.
        If you believe that subscriber growth will continue at its rapid pace, then this stock is one to buy on pullbacks from overbought levels based on long-term positioning.","T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) may be the most disruptive telecom provider in the industry based on its numerous prepaid offerings, free data/minutes plans, and BingeOn streaming packages which don't affect data for certain offerings. All this focus on what customers value has driven significant subscriber growth in recent years. This disruptive growth has benefited shareholders as the stock has maintained a long-term uptrend and has continued to make new highs. I believe the charts on all-time frames combined with the recent major long-term bullish options positioning makes this a stock to buy on all pullbacks.Daily TimeframeOn the daily chart, it is evident that the stock recently traded at all-time highs and has pulled back with recent market weakness. The RSI remains in a bullish zone above 50 after having pulled back from overbought levels. The stock is above its rising 50 and 200 day simple moving averages and is above a major support level of ~$40.2. In addition, the stock's long-term uptrend line continues to hold as the stock reaches new highs and it appears to have emerged from a 1 year trading range.Weekly TimeframeOn a weekly timeframe, the long-term uptrend line is much clearer and has only been touched 7 times since 2012. Again, the company is above its 50 and 200 weekly simple moving averages. The RSI remains in a bullish zone and has never reached oversold levels since 2011. In addition, the consolidation that the stock is emerging from is clear after having traded between $33.5 and $40.2 for the past year. The recent pullback while shallow is significant as the long-term uptrend line is intersecting with the horizontal support line and should provide additional support for the stock at the $40.2 level.Monthly TimeframeOn the monthly timeframe, the long-term chart is clearly bullish. The RSI has not reached oversold once and shows that buyers clearly have significant demand for the stock above the $33.5 level since breaking that on 4/15.Large Options PositioningOptions positioning in TMUS has been long-term bullish with many sizeable investments made. As retail investors, we must always be aware that we cannot see the other side of the options trade. There is always the risk that a large options position could be a hedge against a long or short position or simply that the trader is trying to make a delta-neutral bet on volatility rising in the options. That being said, repeat bullish positioning along with technicals can be a strong indicator. Furthermore, there has been numerous rumors of acquisition interest in TMUS from Sprint (NYSE:S) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) which could come to fruition as the company's subscriber base continues its rapid growth. The below are examples of notable trades in the options market regarding TMUS:On 5/20, 4,000 Aug 43 calls were bought for $1.93 = $772,000 of premium boughtOn 5/10 and 5/11 combined, 65,000 Jan 50-55 call spreads were bought for $0.62 - $0.67 = ~$4,200,000 of premium boughtOn 5/10, 1,000 Nov 46 calls were bought for $1.39 = $139,000 of premium boughtThe major premium (~$5 million in total premium outlayed) bought in TMUS over the long-term combined with the strong technical charts over all timeframes points to higher prices in the future. I believe this is a stock to watch for pullbacks within the long-term uptrend to initiate or add to bullish positions."

3962968,95916,2016-04-04T12:44:38-04:00,"Recent reports notwithstanding, the jury is still out on whether Binge On will help or hurt T-Mobile in the long run.Early apparent success is not surprising, since T-Mobile derived an extremely large one-off benefit up front while the costs will take time to appear.YouTube's recent addition to Binge On, while a necessary step, will place especially high degrees of strain on the network, since YouTube is a lower-resolution service.","IntroductionAfter being a T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) bull for three years, I became a bear in a single day on November 10th, 2015, the day of Un-Carrier X. Binge On, as it is also called, offers T-Mobile subscribers who buy any expanded data package un-metered video streaming from all participating content providers, in exchange for accepting a lower bit-rate, 480p resolution stream instead of the higher 1080p. Since that time, I have written a number of articles explaining my thesis that T-Mobile's network cannot handle the data demands that will be placed upon it by this new non-metered video service.However, Binge On has received almost universally positive reviews so far from both technical and financial analysts, who anticipate a new source of subscriber additions at little extra cost to the network. And the early results of Binge On have largely borne out their views. The purpose of this article is to explain why appearances, in this case, are deceiving. I reiterate once again my bearish view on T-Mobile and Binge On.Image Source: T-MobileEarly ResultsThere has been a lot of push back against my position, from some very smart people. In addition to the usual arguments that T-Mobile knows its own network better than I do, which is certainly true, one additional point that has been made to me numerous times is that my thesis may already be out of date. Numerous reports have claimed that Binge On has already proven to be a smashing success, including T-Mobile itself going so far as to claim that Binge On has actually reduced strain on the network. That's par for the course for T-Mobile, which has been eager to rebut any claims that Binge On is too much for them. Their biggest rebuttal probably came just a few weeks after announcing it, when T-Mobile gave all existing subscribers three free months of unlimited data as a Christmas present, as long as they kept Binge On switched on.So, if the network can take the strain of giving unlimited to everyone, it must be in great shape, no?No. There are three reasons to think that there are a few chapters left to this story.Head StartFirst, T-Mobile's positive reports about the early impact of Binge On on their network need to be read in light of the fact that the structure of Binge On almost guarantees that it will appear to succeed for the first few months. To understand why, remember how the program actually works. T-Mobile installs hardware/software that detects a video stream passing over their data network and automatically downgrades the bit rate to that sufficient for a 480p stream. It then removes the bandwidth used during the stream from the count of monthly data used.Various estimates exist for how much throughput this saves. T-Mobile itself initially claimed that 1080p required 2.2X more data than 480p, but a short while later it contradicted itself when it said that Binge On would allow people to consume ""triple"" the video. 3X corresponded to my own estimates, but some have claimed the real number is actually 4X.The impact of this on the network obviously depends on how much extra video streaming people do because of Binge On, and how much of that usage occurs during peak hours. But, in the race between T-Mobile and video streamers, T-Mobile has a huge head start. Before a single person increases their video streaming because of Binge On, all the existing video streams that were going through their network on November 10th instantly become only 1/3-1/4 the size they were before on November 9th.With video constituting around 60% of mobile traffic, one would expect this to produce a measurable improvement in network capacity, at least at first. The problem with this is that it's strictly a one-time benefit. Meanwhile, the extra video traffic Binge On produces from newly liberated customers increases gradually over time, as more people take advantage of it more often and as T-Mobile's mix of subscribers shifts. After Binge On was announced it became far more likely that any heavy video consumers on competing wireless carriers would choose T-Mobile as their new provider over competitors like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), who still cap video streaming at levels hard-core streamers find far too low.Self-Interested CharitySecondly, it should not be assumed that confidence motivated T-Mobile's offer. It's just as plausible to think fear, or at least trepidation, motivated it. When T-Mobile launched Binge On, it included 24 streaming services, including such mainstays as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Hulu. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Video was added a little while later. But one big name was missing: Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube. T-Mobile's explanation was that YouTube did not quite meet their technical specifications, since Binge On needs a 100% accurate method of determining if a stream is video in order to function. They promised that they were working on it and hoped to have YouTube on the program soon.That wasn't good enough for Alphabet, who objected that Binge On violated net neutrality because it moved all video streaming into the 480p standard, even that from non-participating providers such as YouTube. T-Mobile's reply, that subscribers had the option to disable the feature, didn't satisfy them. They also pointed out that Binge On degraded all video traffic on all data plans, even those on the basic T-Mobile plan who hadn't purchased extra data and therefore were not receiving the benefit of their video usage being un-metered. Alphabet argued the program should be opt-in, not opt-out, insisting net neutrality rules prohibited T-Mobile from reducing anyone's bit rate without their explicit consent. They threatened to file with the FCC.Permit me to posit a scenario, one which seems to me no less plausible than a multi-billion dollar company handing out spontaneous Christmas gifts. So, T-Mobile was being threatened with litigation. Then it remembered it had a lot of surplus in the network at the moment. And its brilliant ""Christmas present"" was born. The unlimited data offer essentially punted any potential litigation or FCC hearings for three months. Since keeping Binge On was the only requirement, every video service was essentially un-metered for three months, even YouTube and other non-participants. The only subscribers who didn't get the benefit were those who disabled Binge On, and they obviously couldn't complain the program was hurting them. No harm meant no foul, meant, T-Mobile hoped, no hearings.Without being a fly on the wall in the room when Legere approved the unlimited data, of course, I cannot prove that this was what he was thinking when it happened. But it makes sense, and even if it wasn't his sole motivation, I would guess that he was at the very least aware that this would be an important side benefit.Meanwhile, negotiations were underway. When Alphabet made it clear that it wanted changes before it would drop its objections, and its threats, T-Mobile started making concessions. Just a few weeks after the unlimited data special ran out, T-Mobile announced that it had reached agreement with Alphabet on all outstanding issues, bringing YouTube into Binge On and alleviating Alphabet's concerns about net neutrality. Legere had agreed to almost all Alphabet's conditions, including giving video providers themselves access to Binge On's protocols so they could optimize their video streams directly, rather than through T-Mobile, as well as making it easier for subscribers to enable and disable Binge On completely. In addition, video providers themselves will now also be able to disable Binge On if they choose not to participate in the program and return to full streams. Previously, all video streams were downgraded automatically regardless of whether or not the provider was a participant.Nothing For SomethingWith YouTube being far and away the most popular video service on mobile devices - data caps have pushed subscribers towards short-form content instead of full movies and TV episodes from Netflix and others - T-Mobile probably felt that they needed to get YouTube on board. But while that was probably true, it is also the third reason that Binge On's ultimate impact on T-Mobile is yet to be determined.YouTube may be harder than the other services for T-Mobile's network to absorb, for two reasons. The first is simply, as I said, that it's bigger. But the other reason is that, when it comes to Binge On, YouTube gets but it doesn't really give. Netflix, Hulu, HBO and the other providers on Binge On are mostly providers of professional content. Content by paid thespians, directors, and camera operators which is usually available in 1080p, and was being streamed in 1080p before Binge On debuted. YouTube, on the other hand, is the ultimate amateur video platform. And while some of its content is professional and could be viewed in 1080p, a lot of YouTube's video was uploaded in 480p to begin with, and 480p is the default setting for most YouTube videos.What's more, YouTube itself was already practicing data management, unlike some of the other providers. Stream a video on the YouTube iPhone app and hit settings, and resolution gives you four options: 144p, 240p, 360p, and 480p. In other words, the highest resolution available is the Binge On resolution anyway. The iPad app is capable of higher resolutions, and there may be a way to hack higher bit rates on the iPhone or Android as well, but the vast majority of YouTube content is probably going to keep coming in exactly the way it was before. That means that the benefit to T-Mobile's network of adding YouTube to Binge On will be minimal. On a lot of videos, there is no downgrading to be done.ConclusionThe end of the YouTube-Binge On saga was probably inevitable, given that neither the most popular mobile video service nor the only real un-metered mobile video offering could really afford to ignore the other. But it is still significant that for T-Mobile, at least, most all of the good news from Binge On for its network is already in, while most of the bad news is still gathering on the horizon.While I am fully cognizant of being part of a dwindling minority, I remain deeply skeptical of T-Mobile's ability to maintain network performance and price competitiveness under the strain of Binge On. I do not believe its stock is a buy under these circumstances. But without knowing exactly when the network pressure will reach a breaking point, shorting it would also be dangerous. For now, I recommend just avoiding the stock altogether."

The Stock Up program seeks to give each T-Mobile account holder a free share of T-Mobile stock. While this may seem gimmicky to SA readers, it provides investment savvy T-Mobile users with an opportunity to cash in on a share of the stock and also an opportunity for all investors to give the stock consideration. T-Mobile investors should be aware of the unique risks facing the telecom sector and how these risks may negatively affect T-Mobile or play to its advantage as the ""Un-Carrier."" What holders of this share do with it after they redeem it is up to them; however, I believe that it may be a good hold.How to Redeem Your Free T-Mobile Share(s):T-Mobile is offering a single share of TMUS stock to every T-Mobile primary account holder. No matter how many lines are attached to the account (ex: a 4 line family plan), the primary account holder still only gets a single share. This being said, the primary account holder can earn another share (up to 100 per year) for referrals. Fair warning: redeeming the share is a somewhat tedious process.First, the T-Mobile customer must download the ""T-Mobile Tuesdays"" app from the Apple app store or Google play store. Next, the customer will need to sign in using the primary account holder's number. Then, the stock offer will be in the ""my stuff"" folder within the app. Claimants will then need to create a new brokerage account on the free trading platform Loyal3. Be aware that, while this process was not as laborious as creating an account with the normal brokerage, it requires much of the same information. Also note that the TMUS stock must be claimed by June 21st. Supposedly, this share will be deposited into the Loyal3 account within two weeks after the claim is completed. Even if a T-Mobile user chooses not to redeem their TMUS share, the T-mobile Tuesdays app sounds like it will be a rewarding download and excellent customer appreciation tool: ""The Un-carrier will unveil a surprise 'thank you' for customers with a new partner each week. Gifts like free movie tickets, free gift cards, free subscriptions, free ride-sharing and more."" - T-Mobile U.S.T-Mobile is not creating new stock for this campaign but rather purchasing existing shares for claimants.Risks Facing the Telecom Sector:Once an investor has their free TMUS share, the investor should be aware of the many unique risks now facing the telecom sector. Brad Sorenson of Charles Schwab places an underperform rating on the telecom sector as a whole because of three key risks: rising expenses, heavy debt loads, and falling profits. Sorenson believes that the sector's wireless growth is both its biggest strength and weakness.Sorenson notes that wireless growth has increased expenses for providers due to a need to upgrade equipment and pay for the related labor to do so. AT&T's recent tests of 5G towers should serve as a reminder that this technology will eventually be rolled out. According to CNET, standards for the technology will be established by 2020; however, wireless companies are and will be spending significant money on 5G developments. Compounding this issue is Garner's forecast which predicts that ""connected devices"" across the world will increase from 6.4 billion devices in 2016 to 20.8 billion devices in 2020. It must be noted that this figure includes the ""Internet of Things"" (including connected light bulbs) which utilize WIFI connections.Sorenson also highlights that the telecom sector has taken on tremendous amounts of debt to finance infrastructure improvements. As a result, the telecom sector now has the highest debt / equity ratio of any non financial sector. Sorenson notes that this could be problematic for the sector when interest rates go up.Finally, Sorenson notes that while there has been a tremendous increase in wireless demand, there has been a significant decrease in pricing power and profits for wireless carriers over the past few years. This is due to increasing pricing competition between wireless carriers and budget conscious consumers who are beginning to favor less expensive and contract free wireless plans. Clearly, an investor seeking exposure to telecoms must acknowledge the significant risks that the sector faces.Investors May Want to Hold their T-Mobile Shares:Despite the risks outlined for the telecom sector as a whole including rising expenses, heavy debt loads, and falling profits, T-Mobile investors may want to hold their shares rather than immediately liquidate them. I believe that T-Mobile is in a unique position to profit from the risks facing the telecom industry; however, with the price of the stock being somewhat high in comparison to its competition, it may not necessarily be a stock that everyone should buy.As Sorenson notes, wireless customers are becoming increasingly budget conscious and are beginning to favor less expensive and contract free plans. T-Mobile's current business model is based on capturing these budget conscious customers who will see that AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) plans are more expensive across the board. T-Mobile also no longer offers contract / subsidized wireless plans. Rather, customers pay a certain rate per month and have the option to bring their own phone to the plan, purchase a phone, or finance a phone through T-Mobile. Plans start at $50 per month per line with additional add-ons for more 4g data. Metro PCS undercuts T-Mobile with a contract free, $30 per month per line plan; however, Metro does not offer Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) popular iPhone through their stores or website, whereas T-Mobile does offer the iPhone.Standard and Poor's currently has a ""Buy"" rating on AT&T with a $42 12 month price target and a ""Hold"" rating on Verizon with a $51 12 month price target. Angelo Zino of S&P highlights that wireless growth for both companies will be constrained because of consumer sentiment shift towards value service providers; however, both will continue to have profitable wireline businesses. T-Mobile does not have a wireline business to fall back on; however, Consumer Reports notes that, among the ""big 4"" wireless providers, T-Mobile receives the highest customer satisfaction scores. Excellent service, combined with low prices, could mean that T-Mobile is in a unique position to capture and profit from a larger portion of the 14.4 billion devices that will be connected between now and 2020 and beyond than the other big 4 wireless carriers. Zino seconds this opinion and believes that T-Mobile's contract free and no subsidy model will allow it to see wireless share gains. S&P currently has a ""Hold"" rating on T-Mobile with a $45 price 12 month price target.Furthermore, T-Mobile has a similar debt equity ratio to AT&T and a much lower debt equity ratio compared to Verizon. The following chart shows T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon's total debt to equity ratio from 2011 to 2015.Graphically, the same chart is displayed below:As is shown, in 2015, AT&T had the lowest debt equity ratio of the group of 1.03; however, T-Mobile's was not much higher at 1.59. It should be noted that T-Mobile's ratio has been relatively steady over the past few years, whereas AT&T's has been steadily climbing. In sharp contrast, Verizon's debt equity ratio has swollen over the past few years to 6.71 in 2015. Sorenson is correct in pointing out that swelling debt among telecom companies is a problem going forward; however, T-Mobile appears to be keeping their borrowing under control.With all of these points considered, I believe that T-Mobile may be an excellent hold; however, it may not represent the best value purchase due to its stock price being much higher than its competition. Verizon has the lowest PE ratio of 11.68 and a forward PE of 13.10. AT&T has a higher PE ratio of 17.03 but a forward PE of 13.91. In comparison T-Mobile has a high PE of 29.87 with an even higher forward PE of 34.17.For easy reference, below is a chart showing a 1 year comparison of stock prices for T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon:- Google FinanceBelow is a 5 year comparison:- Google FinanceInvestor Takeaway:Despite the risks outlined for the telecom sector as a whole including rising expenses, heavy debt loads, and falling profits, T-Mobile investors may want to hold their shares whether acquired traditionally or through the ""stock up"" program. I believe that T-Mobile is in a unique position to profit from the risks facing the telecom industry because of its positioning as the ""un-carrier,"" high customer satisfaction, and low debt / equity ratio. However, with the price of the stock being somewhat high in comparison to its competition, it may be a better hold and is not necessarily a stock that everyone should buy.Finally, just an interesting thought. T-Mobile may be a fun short-term play for the next few weeks if T-Mobile is currently purchasing shares for its ""stock up"" claimants. Buried deep in the ""stock up"" prospectus is the following info: ""Open Market. Share purchases in the open market for the Initial Offer will generally occur on a daily basis on the first regular trading day following approval of the account by LOYAL3 (or on the next trading day if the market is not open), which normally takes four or more business days after your order is entered, but may be longer. You will receive an electronic redemption confirmation upon deposit of the Share into your LOYAL3 account."" This appears to say that the stock was not purchased before the ""stock up"" promotion was announced and will be effectuated as claims come in. With over 11 million eligible accounts for the ""stock up"" program, this could increase trade volume over the next few weeks and prop up the stock if it dips. On the other hand it may not have much of an effect on stock price, considering that many may choose not to participate in the program or may immediately liquidate their share."
3989006,79555,2016-07-18T03:58:57-04:00,"T-Mobile markets itself as an against-the-grain ""Un-carrier"".It has consistently built value for its customers and attracted them over the past few years.The company is poised to continue its growth and build value for itself as a business and for its customers.","OverviewT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is the fastest growing carrier and wireless company in the US, based on customer growth in 2015. The company provides wireless communications services, including voice, messaging and data, to over 63 million customers in the postpaid, prepaid, and wholesale markets.The company prides itself on being the ""Un-carrier"", meaning unlike other carriers, it has a fully customer-oriented approach based on fulfilling customer needs and making their industry a better, more advanced place. The company does this by focusing on improving and expanding its 4G LTE coverage, offering devices that mold to customer needs, and providing plans that are simple and affordable without cumbersome restrictions.In 2013, T-Mobile merged with MetroPCS.StrategyAs mentioned above, the company aspires to be the ""Un-carrier"", which is essentially a strategy of attracting customers by providing the maximum amount of value.As a result of this approach, the company aims to provide customers with affordable rate plans while eliminating annual service contracts, making it easier for customers to upgrade their devices, reimbursing customers' transfer fees when they switch over from other carriers, letting customers stream music for free, giving customers the ability to roll-over up to 20 gigabytes of data, providing messaging and data roaming while traveling abroad for free, and expanding coverage.As a result of the company's efforts, its branded postpaid phone churn improved to 1.39% in 2015, compared to 1.58% in 2014 and 1.69% in 2013.The company also wants to focus on cutting business costs and increasing savings, which can then be invested back into the business.In 2015, the company got 66% of its revenue from branded postpaid customers, 30% from branded prepaid customers, and 4% from wholesale customers. The company had 4.5 million post-paid customer in 2015, compared to 4.9 million in 2014 and 2.0 million in 2013.EarningsThe company's revenues have consistently increased over the past few years. Total revenues from services increased from $22.4 billion to $24.8 billion, an 11% increase, and total revenues increased from $29.6 billion to $32 billion, an increase of 8%. The company's operating income increased 46%, from $1.4 billion to $2 billion. Net income increased from $247 million to $733 million.TMUS Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsThe company's decreased operating income in 2012 and 2011 is a result of huge impairment charges and had nothing to do with the performance of the business. The company says it ""recognizes impairment charges, rather than bad debt expense, to reduce the receivables to fair value for estimated losses.""Cash FlowThe company's cash flows, which are often a better barometer of the company's health, also appear to be healthy and on the rise. Net cash from operations increased from $3.5 billion in 2013 to $4.1 billion in 2014, and then to $5.4 billion in 2015. The increase in 2015 was in spite of a $2 billion increase in inventory. The company's cash flows seem on the rise and healthy.TMUS Cash from Operations (Annual) data by YChartsCash flow from operations has increased since 2013, but the distinctive shape of the chart above should raise some eyebrows. The reason for the u-shape is discussed above. As a result of the dramatic impairment charges, the income figures cash flows are drawn from were also impacted. Overall, in this newer business phase, the company's cash flows seem to be stable and on the rise.Book ValueBook value has also increased. The company's total assets increased from $56.7 billion to $62.4 billion. And total shareholder's equity increased from $15.7 billion to $16.6 billion.TMUS Book Value (Annual) data by YChartsWhat's worrying though, is the company's indebtedness. The value of its total long-term debt increased from $16.2 billion in 2014 to $20.5 billion in 2015. In addition, $600 billion of the company's debt is up for restructuring this year, with the aim of changing interest rates to adjust for inflation.Debt is never a good thing and this should worry investors, but it's important to keep in mind that the company has strong cash flows and earnings, and has managed to do very well over the past few years. But, hopefully, it will now work towards reducing its debt levels now that is has more cash.Comparison to CompetitionAs strange as it might sound, the carrier industry is very similar to the airline industry. The barrier to enter is very, very high since it takes enormous amounts of cash and expertise to set-up a nationwide phone service. Also, because customers don't really have any brand loyalty to any one carrier, competition is vicious.The best way to succeed is to offer the greatest value to your customers. And the carrier that works hardest to create value for its customers is T-Mobile, and effects are apparent. T-Mobile has the greatest social media buzz on the web, and it obviously has an effective marketing strategy since more and more people are signing up for its services as a result of its cost-cutting, value-adding business plan.In my opinion, this is the company's strongest aspect. All carriers attempt to give you options to buy good phones, and then give you wireless services. The product is essentially the same. What customers care about is the value and ease of access they get. And this is what T-Mobile is great at and continues to do.PriceTMUS data by YChartsThe company's stock has been relatively stable this year, although it has risen rapidly in years prior.VerdictI think T-Mobile is a very solid, growing business. I has a clear objective advantage over its significantly larger customers and it continues to attract customers by genuinely building the best possible product for them. In my opinion, this is a winning formula.I personally don't think an investor should or can expect astounding returns from the stock, like they would a bargain value stock, but because the company has lots of room to grow, so will the stock."
3970202,64693,2016-05-02T11:24:10-04:00,"The pullback in T-Mobile shares following 1Q16 results on April 26 (-4.5% vs. +0.2% S&P 500) creates an attractive opportunity to buy the stock.Following a +6.3% run-up in share prices in the last month, a correction was expected. But with the solid results T-Mobile reported, it only makes sense to go long.The company upgraded its guidance for 2016, which re-enforces T-Mobile’s operational and earnings momentum over its telecom competitors.","It really doesn't get better than this. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) 1Q16 results were good…again. For an industry that is competitive and mature, the company has done an incredible job of continuously adding subscribers and taking market share from industry leaders AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and overtook its nearest competitor Sprint (NYE:SS) last year.1Q16 results saw the company add its 12th straight quarter of subscriber additions of over 1 million. Revenue rose 11% to $8.6 billion, driven by a 13% increase in service revenue to $6.6 billion. PAT came in at $479 million (EPS $0.56), compared with a loss of $63 million in 1Q15 (EPS: -$0.09). While results were clearly better than consensus estimates, the increase in guidance is what increases the confidence to buy the company's stock. T-Mobile increased its postpaid net-add FY16 guidance range to 3.2-3.6 million (from 2.4-3.4 million) and EBITDA target to $9.7-10.2 billion from $9.1-9.7 billion.Source: Company Reports (1Q2016InvestorFactbook)Differentiated marketing and innovation have driven T-Mobile's SuccessFocus on customer needs and creative packages have driven T-Mobile's long-term outperformance over its competitors (and in this quarter). In the postpaid segment, T-Mobile has gained strong subscriber addition momentum by offering simplified pricing plans, unbundling of handset versus wireless plan cost, and differentiated marketing campaigns aimed at addressing customer pain points.In the pre-paid segment, T-Mobile's merger with MetroPCS has provided additional scope for growth. A combination of T-Mobile's nationwide network, adequate spectrum availability and MetroPCS' low-cost dealer network provide good growth potential to the subscriber base.The above strategy of differentiated marketing began in 2013 when the company introduced a series of innovative twists to its service plan and pricing systems. This has allowed T-Mobile to revive its brand and reverse its once-negative subscriber growth trajectory. Below are the most notable of T-Mobile's Un-carrier moves:• Handset installment plans in 2013: T-Mobile was the first to offer equipment installment plans in March 2013. The company offered both a subsidy model and an installment model and ultimately standardized on the installment model.• Free international roaming: In July 2015, T-Mobile introduced Mobile without Borders by extending coverage and calling across the U.S., Mexico and Canada for all Simple Choice customers at no extra charge. This was the first plan that covered the North America continent.• JUMP! early upgrade option: For a monthly fee, JUMP! Customers are able to upgrade their phones up to three times per year. Thus far, this appears to be primarily a marketing win as the financial impact has been modest.• Data Stash or data rollover: T-Mobile introduced Data Stash in December 2014, giving customers the ability to roll their unused data each month into a personal Data Stash so they can use it when they need it for up to a year. This was an industry leading move, and AT&T quickly followed suit at the beginning of 2015. T-Mobile further upgraded the program by providing a one-time 10GB free data to selected postpaid and prepaid customers.• Mobile without Borders: T-Mobile offers calling to Mexico and Canada without an incremental fee. The company began this program this past July. It allows T-Mobile to at least counter AT&T's recent push into Mexico.To be honest, T-Mobile also has benefited from a lack of versatility displayed by AT&T and Verizon to gain subscriber base and a failure of Sprint's attempts to decelerate its market share losses. I expect that mature, incumbent players, AT&T and Verizon, are unlikely to make the price changes necessary to really stop T-Mobile's momentum and instead are likely to focus on maintaining cash flow. With Sprint now focused on cost cutting and maintaining liquidity, it is also no longer a real threat to T-Mobile's operational and earnings momentum. The only real challenge that T-Mobile will face is to prove to customers that even though its network may not be as big as AT&T's or Verizon's, it is just as good. While quality seems better so far, the verdict is not yet in, and T-Mobile needs to augment coverage in some areas to catch up.In early February 2016, T-Mobile added to its 700MHz portfolio by acquiring spectrum covering 48mn POPs at a cost of a $1.20/MHz-POP. This brings its reach to ~260mn POPs, of which it covers 190mn. While T-Mobile already had adequate MHz per subscriber, its additional spectrum purchase should ensure that the company provides robust network quality.So what does all this momentum in subscriber addition lead to? It leads to higher revenue and for a capex intensive industry, operating leverage benefits. T-Mobile has seen its EBITDA margin expand from 25% in FY14 to 30% in 2015 and 32% in 1Q16. More importantly, the company also is reporting strong improvement in FCF. The company reported FCF of $1.0 billion in FY15 vs. a negative FCF of $90 million in FY14. Factset consensus expects the company to report FCF of $2.0 billion in FY16, implying FCF growth of almost 100% over FY15.T-Mobile's FCF is likely to increase in the coming years primarily because of 1) a growing subscriber base that drives operating leverage and 2) working capital requirement easing with moderation in account receivables relating to the equipment instalment plan (EIP). This is because T-Mobile has already fully penetrated its subscriber base with devices on financing plans, so the shift from equipment installment plans to device leasing plans should not materially alter the net cash flow impacts. Indeed, T-Mobile's equipment sales and leasing business will consume materially less cash in 2016 compared to 2015.M&A angleDeutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGF) controls T-Mobile USA (66.75% equity stake). Given the strong performance and lack of synergies for DTE to continue holding a stake in T-Mobile, there is a strong likelihood that T-Mobile will eventually be bought out by a bigger player.In July 2014, French telecom operator Iliad (OTCPK:ILIAY) offered $33/share in cash to acquire 56.6% of T-Mobile US. The offer was expanded a few weeks later to include 67% of the company (at the same price per share), but ultimately withdrawn in October 2014 when the bid failed to win acceptance with the boards of Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile US. T-Mobile's EBITDA 2016 forecast of $9.9 billion is almost twice its 2014 EBITDA of $5.6 billion. This implies that T-Mobile's upside could be significantly higher from current levels and a more attractive M&A target commanding upwards of twice the price it did before.ValuationT-Mobile is currently trading at FY16/17E P/E of 33.1x/21.3x, attractive in the context of expected YoY EPS growth of 45% and 55% in FY16E and FY17E, respectively. In FY15, the company had reported EPS growth of 173%. Its competitor AT&T is trading at FY16E P/E of 13.4x with expected EPS growth of 5.0% and Verizon at 12.7x FY16E P/E with 3.4% EPS growth. Sprint is making huge losses (FY15 loss of $ 3.3 billion) and is not expected to break-even by FY17E.ConclusionIt is worth highlighting that despite the price correction on the result day, T-Mobile has outperformed all its peers in the last year. T-Mobile shares are up 14.6% in the last year, AT&T up 12.0%, Verizon up 0.8%, and Sprint down 30.2%. Given T-Mobile's 1Q16 results, I would not be surprised to see another year of outperformance by the company. It is on the forefront of driving change in the telecom industry and still an attractive acquisition candidate. T-Mobile seems to be firing on all cylinders and now is a better time than ever to go long the stock with both operational catalysts and financial catalysts driving the stock price up.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3901196,37141,2016-02-17T03:25:10-05:00,,"By Eirik NordgaardT-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) is set to report its fourth quarter financial results before the bell on Wednesday (2/17). In January the company provided a preliminary view on subscriber addition for Q4 as well as for the full-year of 2015. The report revealed that T-Mobile's aggressive promotional activities and Un-carrier initiatives helped register record subscriber growth in 2015. Another key metric investors will be looking at is how many postpaid wireless customers the company gained in the latest quarter. Investors and analysts will also be paying close attention to the companies margins for the quarter as lucrative promotion schemes such as free music and video streaming could have caused margins to shrink. Wall Street is anticipating T-Mobile to announce earnings of 15 cents per share and revenue of $ 8.2 billion for the quarter.We populated the SprinkleBit analyzer with T-Mobile's main competitors in the wireless telecom industry to project how its financial fundamentals compare to its peers. Let's take a look at how T-Mobile compares against AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Sprint (NYSE:S), and SK Telecom (NYSE:SKM). For this analysis we chose to emphasize on EBITDA in order to evaluate performance. Wireless companies often experience large capital expenses related to network expansions, so EBITDA helps us determine whether the core operating business, without the effects of capital expenditure and interest payments, is making money. It gives investors a convenient metric for comparing the profitability of companies that have different capital investment patterns. By running the fundamental measures in comparison to the companies mentioned, we received an implied share price of $ 36.31. With the current trading price of $ 35.83 (2/16 @ 10.30am) T-Mobile is undervalued with 1.33%.We also analyzed the technicals on the daily chart in order to see where the stock price could potentially move to on the release of earnings. With an entry price of $35.83 and a reported loss on earnings, the stock has the potential to fall to $ 33, for a 7.9% loss. With an entry price of $35.83 and a reported beat on earnings, the stock has the potential to rise to $38.50 for a 7.45% gain. The risk/reward ratio for this trade is 0.94."
3956669,95916,2016-03-08T13:04:06-05:00,"T-Mobile's outstanding run over the last few years may now be coming to a close as Binge On puts new pressure on the capacity of the network.Most expectations of future growth are already baked into the stock price, making it unattractive from a risk/reward perspective even if it does hold on.T-Mobile's asset holdings, including spectrum, also are fully valued or even overvalued.","IntroductionThree years ago, I was transformed from a T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) bear into a bull in a single day with CEO John Legere's launch of Un-Carrier 1.0. You remember, the one way back when he abolished all contracts and termination fees and separated the purchase of the phone and the purchase of cell service into two separate transactions, with the option of a zero-interest loan on the phones for well-qualified customers. Three years later, what I just described is the default for all carriers, as first Verizon (NYSE:VZ), then AT&T (NYSE:T) and finally Sprint (NYSE:S) followed suit in abolishing the two-year contracts that had been the mainstay of the American wireless network for decades. That says a lot about how successful Legere and T-Mobile have been.Then, three months ago, I was transformed back into a bear, again in a single afternoon. This time, it was the Un-Carrier X launch, when Legere announced that henceforth all video streaming would be throttled down to 480p and zero-rated for qualifying customers, which was pretty much anyone that bought more than the lowest-priced data plan. I said then that the plan would not work without a time-shifting network element, which T-Mobile has never deployed. That is still my opinion, and I now recommend selling your T-Mobile holdings.Bingeing Into A HangoverMy reaction to Un-Carrier X was not typical of the tech world, which has generally been cautiously optimistic, or the financial analysts, who have been far less cautious. It does seem, however, to have reflected the sentiment of the investors themselves. Despite posting another rock solid quarter of earnings, T-Mobile stock has been anchored around $38 for months. It spent a few weeks higher, then the next few weeks lower, but it always returns to the anchor price. It is currently at $38.76, more than 10% off its peak, which it hasn't seen in months.In part, this is simply a reaction to the fact that the stock is already priced almost to perfection, with future growth projections already baked into the price and the P/E ratio over 45. But it is also a reflection of the pause Binge On, as Un-Carrier X is known, has brought to many who were previously very optimistic about Legere and Co.I have already explained in my last T-Mobile article why Binge On is ultimately not a sustainable offer and is likely in the long run to do more harm than good to the T-Mobile network. I will not repeat the whole article, but just to summarize what I said there: Any wireless provider is only as good as the network it provides. Network quality, in turn, is judged by customers on two attributes - reliability and capacity. These considerations, combined with the price charged, determine whether or not a wireless company attracts and retains enough subscribers to stay in business. Binge On poses a very real threat to the capacity of T-Mobile's network. This is because video is the largest component of data traffic, overwhelmingly so at 61% of total traffic. Music, by contrast, is less than 10%. Zero-rating video, therefore, does far more to burden the network than zero-rating music does. As these burdens grow, the network's capacity will diminish for all customers, and subscriber growth will tail off.Stock Primed For A CorrectionT-Mobile is not going to come to a screeching halt tomorrow, of course. As I've said before, zero-rating takes time for its effects to be fully felt. But trying to time exactly when T-Mobile's network will hit the wall would be a very dangerous gamble. That kind of gamble would only be justified by the prospect of a substantial reward for those who took the risk, which T-Mobile does not offer.T-Mobile's stock already has a lot of future growth priced into it. With a P/E of 47 as of this writing, T-Mobile is almost three times AT&T's 16 P/E and almost four times Verizon's 12 P/E. Although 2015 saw T-Mobile add close to 10 million subscribers for the second straight year and triple its net fourth quarter earnings, they would have to triple again just to get the P/E down to AT&T's level. That is assuming that the stock stops here and goes no higher, which of course would make the risk of holding it pointless. And what's more, AT&T's P/E has been somewhat artificially inflated by the DirecTV acquisition and the hopes investors have pinned on it. Without a satellite broadcaster of its own, a better comp for T-Mobile might be Verizon. Even after tripling earnings again next year, its stock would still have to fall almost 25% to match Verizon's P/E.And even assuming T-Mobile can keep the gravy train going another 12 months with minimal network disruption, its costs to do so would still be exorbitant. T-Mobile just announced today that it will sell another $2 billion in bonds to augment the $7.6 billion of cash it already has as it is preparing to spend $10 billion on the upcoming FCC 600 MHz auction. That is more than twice its annual capex spending on its network, a substantial sum. But it still may not be enough. As the number of new bidders preparing to enter the spectrum market continues to increase, it's becoming increasingly likely that $10 billion won't even buy it as much spectrum as it thought. And with the video streaming that is eating this spectrum up being free, it may be hard to monetize this new 11-figure asset. Free unlimited video streaming is thus likely to damage earnings and stock valuation, even if somehow it doesn't damage the network.Spectrum ValuationOrdinarily when a wireless stock seems overvalued, its last refuge is the spectrum itself. Sprint is worth $16 just for its spectrum assets alone, even if its entire business collapsed tomorrow. But T-Mobile cannot find the same comfort in its own holdings. Because spectrum licenses are split by geography as well as frequency, they can actually be somewhat hard to count. Operators tend to report whatever metrics make their spectrum look best. MHz-POP (population-weighted), MHz-100 (top 100 markets), MHz-30 (top 30 markets), etc. T-Mobile is no different, reporting that it has ""82 MHz in the top 25 metro markets."" Some other sources have put it lower. Sprint, for example, counted only 50 MHz for T-Mobile prior to its 700 MHz deal with Verizon, not that Sprint is an unbiased observer either. The 700 MHz deal was nowhere close to 30MHz.I couldn't find anyone saying T-Mobile had more than 80 MHz in the top 30 markets (top 25 is a metric no one else even uses - I'm guessing T-Mobile uses it because the last five don't look so impressive.) Others have them at 60-65 MHz, but I will assume 80 MHz for now. Of that 80 MHz, approximately 10 MHz is low-band 700 MHz spectrum, the rest is PCS and AWS, mid-band spectrum. Mid-band spectrum sold for around $2.50 MHz-POP in the last spectrum auction, which multiplied by the 320 million U.S. population would yield a value of $56 billion. Low-band spectrum is harder to value. When T-Mobile bought it, it cost them $1.85 per MHz-POP. As I explained when valuing Sprint's spectrum, low-band spectrum's value has a lower ceiling than mid-band spectrum, owing to its lower capacity. I will ballpark it around $2.20 per MHz-POP, still a nice 9% return on asset for T-Mobile since they bought it two years ago. That puts the low-band worth another $7.06 billion.The problem is this is all based on America's full population. No one builds spectrum to cover every last person in the country. In areas that are too remote with too few people for the carrier to recoup their investment, the spectrum simply sits idle. That means the proper multiple for the spectrum is not America's full 320 million POPs, but some fraction of them.When I was valuing Sprint's high-band spectrum, I applied a 25% discount. T-Mobile's hoard is lower-frequency, which means it goes farther and covers more people without having to build another tower. I will apply a very optimistic 10% discount to the mid-band and a totally-nonsensical 1% discount to the low-band. That leaves the low-band at $7 billion and the mid-band at $50.4 billion. Netting out T-Mobile's net $21.5 billion of debt leaves the equity at $35 billion. T-Mobile's current market cap is $32 billion. And these were very optimistic estimates. The discounts are probably higher, and some of the mid-band is PCS rather than AWS, which might be worth another markdown. Altogether, I would call T-Mobile either fairly valued or overvalued on a spectrum basis.ConclusionBecause Binge On closely resembles T-Mobile's similar zero-rating offer for music, Music Freedom, the assumption by some was that the risk to T-Mobile's network was minimal. Music Freedom has raised the subscriber count without damaging the network at all. But in fact, Binge On is a completely different animal and the risks it poses to T-Mobile are much greater. With most of the good news already incorporated into the stock price, T-Mobile no longer justifies running these sorts of risks. Four months after Binge On launched, and with more than one expert ready to pronounce it a success, I remain cautious on both Binge On and T-Mobile and re-iterate my bearish thesis.If you bought T-Mobile stock the day it went public on May 1st, 2013, you have reaped a 115% profit in less than three years. But today, Verizon is a better value play and Sprint offers a much bigger growth upside, both with far less risk. It's time to take your profits and leave the table."
3799076,22148,2016-01-08T12:52:33-05:00,T-Mobile reported strong customer additions for Q4.The company continues adding customers without generating much in the way of profits.The stock remains a momentum play.,"Over the last couple of years, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has become a marketing machine behind CEO John Legere. The guy is everywhere on social media hocking the un-carrier concept and slamming the other domestic wireless providers.The magenta-colored, wireless provider again reported exceptional user growth in Q4. At $40, the stock has fought the recent market sell off and is poised to ride momentum higher. Only one hiccup can disrupt the trend and that is the lack of consistent earnings.Solid Customer GrowthCustomer growth is the lifeline of most businesses and that is obviously the case in the domestic wireless market. T-Mobile has led the sector with growth in the last couple of years. Despite a mature market where the vast majority of people have wireless service, the company continues growing the customer base by roughly 2 million users per quarter.The latest quarter included the addition of 1.3 million branded postpaid customers and follows similar numbers in prior periods. Combined with wholesale and prepaid additions, T-Mobile hit the 2 million customer additions again. The total net additions were slightly below prior year periods ever so slightly.The company likes to throw out this chart showing how it leads the industry in service revenue growth.Source: T-Mobile Q315 factbookFrom the industry stand point, T-Mobile has the revenue and customer addition part of the financial equation covered.Other Part Of The EquationThe only problem with the equation is that customer additions don't address the value obtained for each one. With the aggressive marketing push, adding customers isn't always a good thing if the company had to cut rates.In the case of T-Mobile, the CFO suggested at the Citi Media Conference that the company would hit the high end of EBITDA estimates while spending less on the capital expense side. While another good sign, the trend for the earnings estimates continues in a flat to down pattern.TMUS EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsIn Q3, T-Mobile missed EPS estimates by a wide margin and caused the market to lower expectations going forward. Unfortunately, the company has a recent history of focusing on customer growth and not profits. At some point, the wireless provider will run out of customers to add without generating any profits from the ones added over the years.TakeawayThe key takeaway is that investors should stick with the momentum in the stock for now. The market likes customer growth and the potential bump from being a merger target. At the end of the day though, T-Mobile could leave shareholders with limited ability to grow customers and limited amounts falling to the bottom line that will someday come home to roost."
3679356,78265,2015-11-12T10:38:37-05:00,"We believe investors are rewarding T-Mobile for strong revenue growth. We'd remind them that it's operating profits and not revenue that is the source of long run shareholder returns.The level of operating profit here is only ~2.3% greater than the risk free rate, which we consider inadequate for the risks present.Additionally, the shares are priced very optimistically. We suggest that investors take profits at these elevated levels.","Shares of wireless company T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) are up about 32% over the past year. This performance caught our attention and we thought we'd look in on the name to determine whether the premium share price performance is deserved and what likely faces T-Mobile investors from here. We've checked out the level of operating profits and compared those to the expectations embedded in the current valuation. The picture isn't pretty. We suggest that investors avoid the name. We briefly outline our reasoning below.The basis for all shareholder wealth is operating profits. That's what gives rise (hopefully, eventually in this case) to dividends. Additionally, operating profits drive share price performance over the long term. That's what this entire exercise is about. With that in mind, we want to look at the level of operating profits T-Mobile generates relative to the capital entrusted to management by owners and, increasingly, creditors. It turns out that over the past four quarters, the level of profit to capital is only a few percentage points greater than the risk free rate, or about 4.3%.Source: Company filingsNow this is obviously a backward looking analysis. The point isn't to look backward. The point is to compare where the company is now, versus where the company ""needs"" to be for us to consider it to be investment worthy. For instance, we would normally want operating profits to yield about 7%. In other words, in order for this company to be put on our watchlist, the level of operating profits relative to capital employed would need to jump by about 60% to $1,990. These analyses allow us to apply some sort of discipline to our investment process. Until the level of operating profit jumps, we can safely avoid the name.But Wait There's More … Very Expensive SharesUnfortunately, the art of investing involves more than finding a profitable company (hopefully a much more profitable company than T-Mobile) and buying in. Investors access the long run cash flows of public companies by purchasing shares in the public market. Oftentimes, the short term price movements of those shares reflect more about the mood of the market than they do about the fortunes of the underlying business.When the market's mood about a given name is particularly buoyant/manic, investors face the greatest level of risk because the payoff is skewed against them. In particular, if management achieves the great expectations imposed on them by a hopeful market, the shares may not do much as good news is already priced in the shares. If, as is more typical, the plans laid out by management don't work out perfectly (or quickly enough), the shares may move from being priced excessively optimistically to unduly pessimistically (or at least less optimistically). Thus, investors who buy optimistically priced issues suffer a situation where they enjoy little upside and a great deal of downside. In our own research, we've found this situation borne out often enough.One of the ways we use to judge the level of optimism involves comparing the current and the forward PE multiples. If the forward PE is too low relative to the current, that's a sign that the market may be too optimistic. At the moment, the PE for T-Mobile is 61.3 and the forward multiple is about 15.5. Holding all else constant, that means the market is forecasting an earnings growth rate here of ~296%. We consider this to be optimistic in light of the mediocre level of profits generated on capital and the company's history of earnings.Source: GurufocusConclusionWe believe shares of represent a bad combination of low operating profits and great expectations on the part of investors. We believe that this situation often ends badly for them and so we recommend avoiding the shares at these levels."
3630996,54942,2015-11-03T07:30:00-05:00,Shares of T-Mobile fell following their third-quarter earnings release as bad debt trended higher and ARPU was lower. We think these are overblown issues.The guidance provided is extremely conservative and sets them up for a series of beats and raises over the next several quarters.Valuation is dirt cheap when you compare the growth to that of their primary competition. Comps are tight despite T-Mobile growing at a much faster rate.,"T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) continues to see significant momentum in their business strategy with their price leadership intact and improving plan offerings. The mobile phone service market continues to be split between the high-end leaders, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), and the value players, T-Mobile and Sprint (NYSE:S). Within the value segment, T-Mobile is eating Sprint's lunch and continues to add subs at a strong rate at Sprint's expense.The shares have not moved (-4%) since our last write up in mid-July but we believe the underlying momentum of the business remains and that a new leg higher in the shares is pending. We expect more spectrum deals to drive call and data quality while bad debt expense is likely to stabilize over the next two quarters.Guidance Sets Them Up For A Strong BeatThe thesis from our original Top Idea from earlier this year remains as the company continues to gobble up share from Sprint. With each new UnCarrier initiative while improving their coverage, they continue to not only gain new subs from Sprint along with the other carriers, but reduce churn by giving existing customers compelling reasons to remain with them. The company has just 14% of the postpaid sub market, thus they have significant expansion opportunities.Management again raised guidance for subs while maintaining their EBITDA guidance which indicates to us that the latter will be easily beaten. They raised postpaid net addition expectations for the fiscal year to 3.8-4.2 million. However, the company has already added 3.2 million this year through the first nine months. Having added over 1 million new subs in each of the first three quarters, we think the high-end of the guidance range even looks a bit conservative.This is especially the case as the new iPhone 6s hit the stores in the last few weeks, driving new customers and increasing subs. We think the fourth quarter could be a significant upside surprise as they add well over 1 million new subs driven by the new iPhone and Galaxy smartphone releases, giving existing Sprint, AT&T, and Verizon customers an opportunity to switch carriers.The guidance for EBITDA and capex is also going to be an easy beat with management keeping their original EBITDA estimates of $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion unchanged. With year-to-date EBITDA at $5.1 billion and third-quarter EBITDA generation of $1.9 billion, up 42% yoy, the company looks like it will eclipse the high end of the range.Negative Factors Weigh On The Current Share PriceOne of the few disappointments in the quarter was the sequential decline in ARPU along with a yoy decline acceleration. We think stabilization will occur and that we may even see a return to some modest growth, in comparison to the other national players who continue to see sharper declines. T-Mobile is fully penetrated on the base on EIP (equipment installment plan) and they are seeing a strong rate of data attached.The company continues to focus on nabbing the highest value postpaid phone customers which are family plans. In the third quarter, with their four for $120 plan offering, the 10 gigabytes for all, and other promotional deals attracting additional families from AT&T and Verizon, ARPU fell. But we think focusing on the metric is shortsighted as these plans tend to have better retention and lower sack costs so the NPV of these family accounts are significantly positive and accretive.Bad debt expense inched higher in the third quarter to $198 million, up from $156 million in the second quarter. This was a big red flag for investors. We think the increase was due to a higher mix of lower credit quality customers added in the first quarter of the year, some of whom are going delinquent on their bills. Additionally, there are some seasonal factors correlated to new phone launches and some first quarter seasonal tax issues. We believe bad debt expense will stabilize and return to the long-term average in 2016, alleviating investor concern.New Spectrum Purchases Building CoverageQuality continues to be one of the largest drivers of why customers churn to new carriers. The company made additional 700 MHz A-block spectrum buys which are expected to be completed in the next few weeks. The deployment of the new extended range LTE is ahead of schedule. The company now has 204 markets live, covering 175 million people. Management still expects to end this year with more than 350 markets.The company reached additional agreements for four more licenses adding another 20 million POPs of 700 MHz spectrum to their portfolio. This would bring the total to 210 million and covering additional cities in the South and West. As the broadcast incentive auction approaches (taking place in first quarter next year) we think they will have another transaction that greatly augments their spectrum assets. Management noted that they plan, ""to participate vigorously in the incentive auction to fill out and bolster [our] nationwide low band spectrum.""Some concern has swirled by investors that the company was likely to issue new equity in order to fund additional spectrum acquisitions. But on the most recent call, management squashed that idea stating:ValuationWe think the recent drop in the share price from the low-$40s to the current $37-$38 provides a solid value opportunity. The EV/EBITDA multiple saw a drop from the 6.5x to the 5.8x area. At these levels, the shares trade in line with comps despite being a mobile pure-play with much faster growth. We noted in our prior write-up that the shares were re-rated higher but are now noting that the shares have given up all of those gains.(Source: Factset)Adjusted EBITDA (ex-leasing) expectations for next year are up over $150 million since our last look on better subs and profitability. However, that was offset by higher net debt as the company issued new $1 billion term loans. Additionally, share count rose 6 million due to their stock compensation plan.EBITDA is growing at 30+% with strong visibility for future growth and yet the shares trade at just 5.7x. Given the still strong buyout potential (although a deal with Dish seems to be dead) and the growth of subs driving profitability, we think the shares are still cheap and will start seeing some traction over the next two quarters. The carriers tend to trade in line with each other but T-Mobile is growing at a much faster rate. Meanwhile, debt and other variables are fairly equivalent. So just on a relative trade basis, T-Mobile is the standout.ConclusionWe think the sell-off following their third-quarter earnings is a solid buying opportunity amid some transitory factors hitting the shares from $42 to $38. Those issues include higher bad debt expense and lower ARPU. But as we noted above, we think bad debt expense should subside and ARPU is being driven by sticky family plans with higher long-term profitability as churn declines. The company is fast-becoming the value carrier compared to Verizon and AT&T while Sprint largely flounders. With the acquisition talks with Dish Network likely dead for now, we still think another suitor may be coming along shortly. We would urge investors to consider the shares at these levels as we think they are worth around $47."
3671786,95916,2015-11-10T12:05:09-05:00,Others and I still believe that unmetered video streaming is the most likely candidate for unveiling.This is both feasible and potentially very significant.But even I believe that some of the speculative hype is in danger of crossing from implausible to absurd.Investors have an opportunity to make gains by ignoring it and focusing on the underlying technology foundation of the new service.,"The Show StartsWe are only hours away from knowing what Un-Carrier 10 really is. At 11 A.M. Pacific time Tuesday, November 10, John Legere will take the stage. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) still hasn't quite obtained Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)-level cult followings for its events, but the success of the ""Un-carrier"" in shaking up the wireless industry means that Tuesday's event will be well worth investors taking the time to watch.I was one of the first (but not the first) to suspect that the teaser Legere offered about ""coming soon to a theatre near you"" was a reference to a full-blown unmetered video streaming feature for T-Mobile subscribers. I explained in the above-linked article why I thought such a service had great potential, and also why it was technologically feasible, despite the skepticism of some. But since Legere hasn't said anything more about what Un-Carrier 10 actually is, I also suggested that to guard against a letdown, and the accompanying loss, investors should consider buying stock in T-Mobile's probable content partners rather than T-Mobile itself.That was a few days ago. With the event approaching, I must admit to being surprised at where T-Mobile found itself at the closing bell Monday. Down almost 12% from its peak in September, and roughly 7% below where it stood before its earnings report at the end of October. With the lack of any real upward movement in the stock the last two weeks since Legere's teaser, the risk of a letdown if Un-Carrier 10 proves to be something less momentous may not be as high as I thought.Legere himself is to blame. That teaser came from the same interview where he said that he had matched last quarter's subscriber add before the new iPhone even came out. That in turn led analysts to hike their forecasts for the quarterly numbers way up. When they came in barely above 2Q, T-Mobile stock fell precipitously. The range-bound trading the last few days can fairly be ascribed, I think, to Legere inflating expectations to an unreasonably high level.Left unsaid in the prevailing gloom was the fact that 2Q and 3Q alike were both very strong quarters. 3Q just wasn't quite as strong as some had expected. That was really no reason to suddenly run out and dump the stock. But now that they have, and with it having sat range-bound ever since, there does not appear to be much excitement to let down.For the record, I stand by my original recommendation, but for those who are going to try to play the stock directly either ahead of or following the announcement, there is one thing you must understand: The key is not what T-Mobile offers Tuesday, the key is how they plan to offer it.All Speculation In ModerationThis does not seem to be understood by many following the company, whose reaction to the persistent rumors of unmetered video have generally fallen into one of two camps: Either it's a crazy idea that's not happening at all, or it's coming in full blazing glory. The latter group seems to seriously think the video offering will look just like the unmetered music offering: stream what you want, when you want, as much as you want from all or most of the leading streaming services. Just like Music Freedom offers unlimited access to 33 of the top music services in the world, including Pandora (NYSE:P), Spotify, Apple Music, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play Music, and 29 others, so Video Freedom will offer Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), HBO, and maybe more. Anytime, anywhere, as much as subscribers want, free.To my mind, this is extremely unlikely, bordering almost on the absurd. I still think Video Freedom is happening. But unlike Music Freedom, a true unlimited offering, Video Freedom or whatever T-Mobile ends up calling it will almost certainly have some sizable strings attached.Careful With That NetworkAs I've already explained in my last article, what makes a service like Video Freedom feasible is just how much off-peak capacity is available on most cellular networks, how low flash storage costs have fallen, and the reasonably high degree of accuracy with which video watching patterns can be inferred and predicted ahead of time. The combination of predictability and cheap storage means that large amounts of video data consumption can be time-shifted to off-peak periods and the resulting data files stored with minimal inconvenience or cost for later viewing. That time-shifting is the crucial piece of the underlying network architecture that makes a service like Video Freedom even remotely possible.Consider the numbers for just a moment. When Music Freedom was announced in June 2014, T-Mobile reported that its customers - and remember it has almost 10 million more of them now than it did then crowding onto the network - had downloaded 7,000 terabytes (TB) worth of songs in the first two months following the announcement. That corresponds to roughly 3.5 million gigabytes of music data consumption (1 TB= 1024 GB divided by 2) per month. Now consider that the average cellular audio stream from Pandora takes 64 kbps (they cut it in half from the standard Wi-Fi rate to respect data caps) while the average Netflix HD stream, even to a mobile device with a relatively small 4-inch screen, takes approximately 5 Mbps, or 80 times that amount. That means duplicating the Music Freedom initiative, assuming identical amount and distribution of media consumed per subscriber, would require over 300 million GB per month, or almost 6GB per subscriber. To give a frame of reference, on a normal T-Mobile Simple Choice plan data upgrades come in 2GB increments at $10 each, or $5 per GB. That means T-Mobile would be giving up approximately $30 on each of its millions of subscribers PER MONTH.Of course, some of that $5 per GB is profit that T-Mobile could forego in exchange for whatever profit is already baked into the baseline price. Fair enough. Perhaps that comparison is too harsh. T-Mobile also offers an unlimited data plan upgrade for $30 over the baseline price. That plan is throttled after 23GB of data usage, while the baseline plan is throttled after 1GB. A 22GB upgrade for $30 corresponds to a price of just $1.25 or so a GB. And T-Mobile just recently started offering, only for family plans with at least 4 lines, a $10 upgrade from 10GB per person to 20GB. So clearly, T-Mobile is confident in its reputation as the data strong network. At that last rate, it is only foregoing $6 a month with Video Freedom.At 61 million subscribers even that ""pittance"" comes to over $4 billion a year. But remember, all this is assuming that the usage of Video Freedom corresponds to the usage of Music Freedom. I don't believe it would. In my opinion, usage of a whatever-whenever service, not only in terms of bytes per minute but also in terms of total minutes, would be much, much higher.Cord-Cutters' Dream Would Be T-Mobile's NightmareThat 3.5 million GB figure from T-Mobile last year comes out to about 1.8 billion songs streamed (3.5 million GB divided by 64 kbps times 8 bits per byte assuming an average of 4 minutes per song) per month. Over 60 million subscribers that comes out to about one song a day. I do not know what the average number of songs listened to per day is for Americans today, but I will hazard a guess it is higher than one. Of course, some people still use the radio, instead of streaming, but another reason the number is not higher is because that is only songs streamed over T-Mobile's network. Say, in the car, or during an exercise run. Music streamed at home or even the office is usually streamed over the Wi-Fi connection. And houses have Wi-Fi connections because they have wireline data providers. Even subscribers who know that they could stream endless music at home without a wireline connection still have one, because they couldn't do all the other things on the Internet - social media, web browsing, and most importantly video streaming - without it.Now, assume T-Mobile announces full Video Freedom the way some are saying that they would. Whenever, wherever, however much you want. No pre-downloading required.For the 10-million-plus broadband-only households in the U.S. - the ones we usually call ""cord-cutters,"" many of whom are actually ""cord-nevers"" - an offer like that poses an interesting question: ""Do I still need a wireline internet connection?"" In my opinion, a lot of them probably wouldn't. While Millennials use the internet for many things, video streaming and gaming are really the only reasons they need a landline connection. Everything else - web browsing, social media posts, iMessage chatting or Kik or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger or whatever they use - really doesn't take that much data. It would probably be possible to fit it all under T-Mobile's data caps. If anyone is willing to move their video consumption from their 47-inch screen to their 4.7-inch screen, Video Freedom means they can suddenly have as much video streaming, as they want without paying for a home data plan. That is a savings of anywhere from $70-$100 a month.Not everyone would be willing to cut their screen 90%, even for that savings. But it wouldn't take many to overload the network and ruin the T-Mobile experience for everyone. The average cord-cutter consumes 212 GB a month on the home internet. At that rate if even 1% of T-Mobile's subscribers shift their cord-cutting habit to the cellular network monthly data consumption will run in excess of 100,000 TB per month, almost thirty times the free data consumption of Music Freedom. There is simply no way the T-Mobile network can handle that. And that's assuming only 1% of subscribers. There are millions of cord-cutters in the US who would probably be tempted to join the T-Mobile network to take advantage. Bump the utilization rate up to just 3-5% and the numbers become truly astronomical. Then there's the other 95% or so, millions of other T-Mobile subscribers who aren't cord-cutters but would still drastically increase their video consumption following such an announcement.Obviously, once Video Freedom is announced, and I still think it will be, T-Mobile can't stop video lovers from coming to take advantage of it. And why would they? Attracting video-loving subscribers is sort of the point. The argument here, as I explained the other day, is simply that the time-shifting component is crucial. If Video Freedom happens at all, I strongly believe only video services with a download for later viewing option will be allowed to participate, to ensure that video data consumption occurs at off-peak times. Currently, Netflix, the leading streaming video service, does not have such an option. And in fact, they've dismissed the idea before. That could have been just playing it coy, but it's also possible that Netflix will be missing from the list of included services for Video Freedom, at least at first.ConclusionTo summarize, Video Freedom is probably coming, and if it is, it is almost certainly coming with strings. Those strings are essential to make it feasible. Yet like with the quarterly numbers, the strings may disappoint some investors. Any exclusion of Netflix from the initial launch, if it happens, is likely to be judged particularly harshly.I recommend ignoring such jeers and heckles. If Video Freedom is real, and designed in a sustainable way, T-Mobile will have been first to market with a very appealing feature. Netflix declining to participate will damage people's perception of Netflix's value far more than it damages their perception of T-Mobile. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime already offers downloads and HBO and Showtime are probably not far behind. T-Mobile will attract enough content partners to make its video offering very attractive regardless of Netflix, and its customers will value the offer even with strings attached. Go long T-Mobile, especially if its dips following the announcement.On the other hand, if there really are no strings attached to downloads, sell T-Mobile, especially if it bounces. Whatever capacity T-Mobile will have budgeted for video consumption in that scenario will never be enough. And the resulting network quality damage will harm the brand for years. The old saying is to buy the rumor and sell the news. This time, investors should wait to read the fine print of the news before they make up their mind."
3903846,22148,2016-02-17T16:22:26-05:00,"T-Mobile reported a big Q4 earnings beat.The stock saw limited traction due to the valuation and questions regarding valuation.My recommendation remains neutral on the stock, with the only reason to own it for a short-term momentum play.","T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) quarterly results again provided some industry leading numbers around user and service revenue growth. The aggressive domestic mobile provider even smashed earnings estimates, though the stock got limited traction.At $37, T-Mobile has traded flat for going on a year now despite the strong numbers. The ironic part is that the better results are occurring while AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) break to multi-year highs. Over the last six months, the wireless giants have produced the bigger returns.For a company to smash earnings and not rally more than the market, the sign is that the stock is likely priced for perfection. For the quarter, T-Mobile beat EPS estimates by $0.19 with a reported $0.34.The key, though, is that the market already expected the company to produce a Q1 EPS of $0.40 and full year at $1.75. The question is really how the Q4 numbers impact these estimates and the indications are mixed. Without an increase in 2016 expectations, the stock already trades at a P/E multiple in excess of 20x.The following slide highlights the historical lumpy earnings and how this beat doesn't likely change the expectations going forward.Source: T-Mobile Q4'15 factbookIn addition, the wild shifts in equipment revenues makes the story difficult to follow. The wireless provider has industry leading service revenue growth, but the equipment revenues collapsed due to a consumer shift towards the leased phone program. The end result is that total revenues were relatively flat over last year as the equipment revenues from revenues are extended out over the length of the lease contract.A big part of the earnings improvement was a reduction in the reported losses from equipment sales. In Q4, T-Mobile lost $417 million on equipment sales versus $632 million in the prior-year period. Likely disappointing to the market was the suggestion on the earnings call that the company is shifting back towards more equipment sales in the first half via the EIP plan that saw a big decline in Q4.The key takeaway is that the Q4 numbers don't really alter my previous research that the company is adding customers without big financial benefits to the bottom line. Or at the very least, not enough to justify the surging stock price from the prior years.T-Mobile reported a strong quarter, but the market already priced the stock for even better results in 2016 that the guidance doesn't provide much upside. My view remains neutral on the stock due to valuation and the inability to push service growth to the bottom line."

The first matures 9/1/18 with a 4.174% yield to maturity. The cusip is 87264aab1 and has a yield to call of 1.87%. The second matures 4/28/19 and yields 5.418%. The cusip is 87264aac9 and has a yield to call of 1.701%. Both are rated BB by S&P and Ba3 by Moody's.According to the quarterly report, the company has $2.642 billion in cash, $1.827 billion in accounts receivable and $3.503 billion in phones that customers are yet to pay for. The liability side shows $6.645 billion in accounts payable, $386 million in loans, $16.386 billion in long-term debt, $5.6 billion in loans to affiliates, and $2.526 billion in long-term financial obligations. First half sales have increased to $15.957 billion from $14.060 billion same time last year.According to Moody's, T-Mobile added 8.3 million net customers in 2014 and 4 million of that was post paid. The churn rate for post paid was only 1.58% which is pretty good. T-Mobile won a $1.8 billion spectrum auction that adds 97 million more people. Just watch their commercials - they'd be glad to let you know. Moody's expects $4.6 billion in capex in 2016 and $700 million in free cash flow for 2015.In a presentation to Deutsche Bank, T-Mobile's average bill per customer was $61.80 a month in Q4 2014, up from $57.28 Q3 2013. A slide showing the increased areas of coverage in the US is quite impressive. I've been a customer for probably 11 years. There's an old saying that an employer pays an employee just enough so that they won't quit their job. My saying is that a phone company's price and service has to be just good enough so that you won't switch carriers. That has been my experience with T-Mobile.Though the company has a lot of debt, it beats the other telecoms that I've written on. CenturyLink (CTL) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are drowning in debt.I won't invest in these bonds as I eschew telecom and technology. Telecom is technology. It comes and goes. When will there be 5G? What if someone invents a satellite phone? Most tech companies do not last more than a few decades. The ones that do hang on do so only because they carry no debt. Having said that, if you like T-Mobile, these bonds would be a good way to go."
3651276,95916,2015-11-05T12:53:00-05:00,"T-Mobile has announced that a new initiative, Un-carrier 10, is slated to be announced in the near future.This could potentially be its most revolutionary move yet, even bigger than eliminating ETFs and contracts.Video streaming data caps are one of the last major customer pain points in the industry.Addressing them could provide a major competitive advantage, at least until the other carriers duplicate the offering.","Although T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) third-quarter earnings report was not quite what most analysts expected, the continued strong subscriber numbers show that the ""Un-carrier"" that has disrupted the U.S. wireless market over the last two-and-a-half years is still a potent consumer brand. In the same interview that maverick CEO John Legere stoked expectations for the third-quarter earnings by revealing that T-Mobile had already passed last quarter's 2.1 million net subscriber adds before the new iPhone even came out. He also hinted that the next phase of the company's Un-carrier revolution, Un-carrier 10, is drawing closer. He gave a few details, as has become the expected custom in the tech sector. Being mysterious is now the accepted way of spurring media speculation and attention. But he did say just enough to get people interested: ""Un-carrier 10 is coming soon to a theatre near you.""Obviously, it's vague enough that it could mean almost anything connected to movies and still be considered truthful advertising. Perhaps T-Mobile is poised to offer 20% discounts on movie tickets to subscribers. But most tend to doubt it. Since Legere took over, T-Mobile has generally shunned the creation of bundle products with non-tech sector operators in favor of making pro-consumer changes in its area of core competency - wireless services. Rumors soon began to buzz that Un-carrier 10 was not really about theatres at all, but rather about video streaming to mobile devices. That makes much more sense since T-Mobile already has a very similar un-metered service for music streaming. But the implications of this go far beyond just being yet another pro consumer move by T-Mobile. If TMUS really is poised to take the plunge on un-metered video streaming, it can only be because it has decided to do something rather momentous: integrate video streaming with a mobile network at the structural and foundational level.Not All Traffic Is Created EqualVideo streaming is in many ways what sets wireline networks and wireless networks apart. In wireline broadband networks, video streaming has quickly become the killer app of the ecosystem. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) alone accounts for over a third of peak broadband traffic, with YouTube, Hulu, Amazon Prime and HBO Go/Now also seeing rapid increases in their own share. But video streaming also is among the most bandwidth-intensive of apps. Wireless networks, with their low and expensive data caps, are too capacity constrained to really deliver that kind of service. Almost any advice column on staying under a data cap starts with: ""hold off on the video."" Social networking apps like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram are the leading data hogs in wireless, with music streaming services like Pandora (NYSE:P) and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new Apple Music also taking a large share. The only video streaming service with a major penetration so far is YouTube, whose clips are far better suited to the mobile world: they can be loaded with far less waiting time since they are shorter and not always in high definition, and also clips have somewhat higher social value. If they are meeting their friends anywhere without a Wi-Fi connection, YouTube users want to share the clip with them before they part. Waiting for a better viewing experience at home is not an option - the way it is with a Netflix series they'd be willing to watch on their own and chat about later.The key word in that paragraph, however, is ""peak"" traffic. Why does Sandvine (OTCPK:SNVNF) measure peak downloads instead of non-peak downloads? Simple: because the non-peak downloads don't really matter.Wireless and wireline networks are both very high-fixed, low-variable cost businesses. Once you have laid the cable in the ground, built the cellular tower, opened the storefronts, sold or leased the consumer equipment devices, and installed everything in the home, the actual cost of running a few electrons worth of data through the pipes is almost infinitesimally small. According to economic theory, then, in a free market, data actually ought to be very cheap since in a properly competitive market, prices equal marginal cost, not total cost.The DuopolyThere are two reasons why wireless data in the real world is absurdly expensive instead of absurdly cheap. The first is the duopoly, which is far from a competitive market. Indeed, a gigabyte (GB) of data at AT&T (NYSE:T) or Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is anywhere from two to ten times as expensive as it is at the upstart T-Mobile or the desperately cornered Sprint (NYSE:S).But the other, more sensible reason is that even though carriers don't have to worry about marginal cost when it comes to data, they do have to worry about customer experience. Many wireless experts have written about this at length, but since it's maybe a little too much length, I'll just summarize the key takeaway: When customers access data networks, they don't want to wait absurdly long times for data to buffer and process. When that happens, they tend to go to another carrier. While marginal cost of actually providing data is small, the cost in lost customers from slow data is high. Hence the emphasis placed on peak traffic. Whatever the demand for data is at the busiest time of day, carriers have to build enough capacity so service at that time remains quick and dependable. So growing data consumption actually is very expensive for carriers. Assuming that a proportionate share of that growth occurs at peak times, carriers have to pay further large fixed costs to expand capacity to match it. The end result is data pricing that actually does come close to matching the total cost of data, rather than the marginal cost. As the most bandwidth-intensive apps in mobile today, video streaming services, and to a lesser extent, gaming services, bear the brunt of the carriers' data traffic control efforts (i.e. caps.).Of course, this comes at a cost in customer satisfaction as customers realize that the Netflix and Hulu fees they pay every month are actually not worth much in the mobile sphere, with little bandwidth to access them. That diminishes the value of both Netflix and its cellular service. But presumably the carriers know, or think they know, that the resulting churn is less than it would be if the caps were not there.But that is only peak traffic. Video streaming at non-peak times does almost nothing to increase carrier costs. So what carriers need is a way to have their cake and eat it too: to give customers a way to stream video to their heart's content at non-peak times when cheap capacity is plentiful, but throttle it back when space on the wireless towers is at a premium.This isn't a new insight. It was four or five years ago, when the first 4G smartphones were released, that experts started talking about better managing unused capacity and reducing overloaded peak times. Later in 2013, when the first LTE iPhone came out and everyone knew data usage was about to explode, they were still talking about it. Because there was so little competitive pressure on the duopoly, consumers had little leverage to force the Big Two to adopt network policies better suited to their needs. Instead, they were stuck with overly restrictive data caps, which most experts find to be exceptionally crude ways of managing traffic (they apply equally to on- and off-peak usage) but which the Big Two found to be excellent ways of boosting revenue, thanks to the accompanying overage fees.A Revolution?Lately, of course, the duopoly has begun to break. T-Mobile has had ten straight quarters of 1 million-plus subscriber growth, has overtaken Sprint for the No. 3 spot in the wireless subscriber race, and is generally forcing all its competitors to match its pro-consumer initiatives. Every carrier in the wireless space, to avoid losing more subscribers to TMUS, must now ask itself how it can make consumers better offers, but in a way that is sustainable and won't break their network, especially when it comes to data caps, which are one of the top consumer complaints. And especially when it comes to video, which is the most frequent violator of breaching data caps.There has already been some movement. Carriers have announced that they will now be throttling their uncapped data users (those on unlimited data plans) only when the tower is congested. When it clears unlimited data customers go back to full speed. So unlimited data consumers are already being offered a deal that better reflects the underlying cost dynamics of the wireless providers: you can use as much data as you want provided you don't make us build new infrastructure to accommodate it.But even that has only limited upside for carriers and their customers. After all, the whole reason the tower is congested is because those are the times when people are actually using their smartphones. Telling someone they can stream video to their heart's content in the middle of the workday does them little good if their employers have anything to say about it. Imagine a cable system that only worked well when there was nothing on, and shorted out every Sunday during NFL games.Enter - perhaps, if the rumors are true - Un-carrier 10. Suppose that instead of letting space go to waste during the day and then rationing everyone at peak times, some users who want to stream video on the way to and from work (a full movie or TV episode, not just a thirty-second YouTube clip) pre-buffered their videos. By downloading what they wanted to watch later in the day ahead of time, they could essentially time-shift large amounts of data consumption from peak times to non-peak times. That would improve their experience and the experience of other customers, who would have less competition for peak capacity. It would also reduce T-Mobile's network costs substantially. To induce such behavior, TMUS could offer to exclude videos downloaded at non-peak times for later viewing from its data caps, much as it already does with most streaming music services.The way it would work would be something like this: a wireless customer gets to work at 9 a.m., say, and knows he has an hour-plus train ride home. Before starting work, he picks the video he wants to watch that evening and tells his smartphone to initiate a ""for-later"" download. The phone and network software, knowing that this video is not being watched at that moment, download it whenever there is a little extra room on the cell towers over the course of the day. Other users have priority, so live web streaming and surfing is unhindered. He puts the phone away and doesn't think about it again until he's on the way out the door.Of course, that would require customers to know what they want to watch ahead of time, and limit them to whatever they downloaded during the day rather than having access to a streaming service's whole catalog. But that is somewhat less of a limitation than some might think. The rise of video streaming providers has led to a concomitant shift in viewing habits from movies to TV series, with the latter now comprising, according to some estimates, as much as 70% of total Netflix viewing. It would be somewhat haphazard for a customer to download a whole movie they've never seen before, with no idea if they will like it or not. But if they are already 30 episodes into a 45 episode TV series, they can safely download episodes 31 and 32 for the trip home with little danger that they will wish they'd downloaded something else. And since the top 5% of users use over half the network resources, it would only take shifting a few bandwidth hogs out of the peak to make a real difference to the quality of service for the rest of their subscribers.Such a solution would not be completely cost free. Video streaming providers themselves would probably expect to be compensated for proving the service and saving carriers so much money, and their content providers would probably expect compensation in turn. T-Mobile could attempt to launch its own streaming service, but I suspect that would prove far from ideal: content rights today are as expensive in the streaming sphere as they are anywhere else, and T-Mobile's customer discounts, network upgrades and spectrum purchases already cost the still-smaller carrier a pretty penny. Far better would be an alliance with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), whose Prime Instant Video already offers downloads as part of its service and would only require a straightforward software update to integrate it with T-Mobile's network. Something that would tell the Prime Video app when to download and when not to. And although Apple and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) do not currently offer subscription services, T-Mobile also could agree that individual pay-per-view (PPV) downloads on iTunes and the Google Play Store were also exempt, provided they occurred at off-peak times. Amazon's own PPV store would of course get similar treatment. Finally, Netflix, Hulu, HBO and others that do not currently offer downloads could probably quickly fashion such an option in their own offerings if they knew they had a willing carrier partner.ConclusionThere is no official confirmation from T-Mobile about what it is planning, but in my opinion, this simply makes too much sense not be in the pipeline. Indeed, many wireless technology experts have been calling for it for years. But without official confirmation some restraint is in order. T-Mobile's own stock is not the ideal trade for this, because if Un-carrier 10 turns out to be something else, the resulting disappointment may push you into a loss.Instead, I recommend initiating long positions with the content providers and streaming services whose cooperation would be essential to carry it out. Their stock would get a similar boost to T-Mobile's from any announcement, but are less likely to drop if it doesn't happen. Focus on strong industry performers who are both creators of top content and have an in-house streaming service. Those are the ones that will benefit regardless of how compensation between the creators and distributors shakes out. CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), home of HBO, are good bets. Also consider a long position in Amazon whose streaming service is currently the only one with a ready-made download option already available. If TMUS is about to unveil un-metered downloads, Amazon's similar customer-first philosophy and its ready download option would make it a natural partner."
3620086,22148,2015-10-29T12:48:06-04:00,"T-Mobile continues growing the customer base but confused the market with volatile EPS numbers.The entertaining CEO needs to explain bottom line growth potential better.The stock is too expensive, especially with analysts cutting back 2016 EPS estimates.","The latest quarterly report from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) continues a trend of solid customer additions and mixed financials. The third or fourth largest domestic wireless provider depending on the source is killing the competition when it comes to attracting new subscribers.The stock surged this year based on improved financials and subscriber additions, but some big concerns linger regarding valuation after this quarterly report. The wireless provider is clearly leading the industry in new customers, but investors have to wonder if the stock peaked at over $40 when the company only earned a meager $0.15 for Q3. The stock has seen massive gains in 2015 despite revenue growth only hitting 7%.The headline numbers are impressive with 2.3 million net adds for the quarter and 1.1 million branded postpaid net adds. The ability to continue drawing in the largest amount of postpaid customers is impressive, but at the same time both industry leaders in AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are seeing record low levels of churn.The churn numbers suggest the addition of new wireless customers with a limited addition of customers stolen from the leading providers. In essence, the heavy users and spenders aren't switching away from the likes of Verizon.The reason these details matter are the questionable bottom line numbers from T-Mobile. Over the previous four quarters, the wireless provider had very volatile earnings numbers. The company has flipped from solid profits to quarterly losses. For Q3 alone, T-Mobile missed Q3 estimates by a wide $0.15.The problem with the company is that it doesn't provide adjusted EPS figures. The whole earnings call is mostly void of discussion on the EPS number or even expenses in general. Ceo John Legere has done an incredible job focusing the market's attention squarely on customer growth. It takes an analyst digging into the numbers to realize that the big miss was primarily due to the MetroPCS network decommissioning charges of $193 million and higher taxes.Looking at the EBITDA adjusted numbers T-Mobile continues producing solid growth on this basis.Source: T-Mobile Q315 FactbookOver the last 12 months, T-Mobile has produced $6.8 billion of adjusted EBITDA. The company has an enterprise value of $51 billion based on $19 billion of net debt listed by the company at the end of Q3. Using the EBITDA figure, T-Mobile trades at roughly 7.5x trailing EBTIDA.The major problem with EBITDA in the telecom sector is that the large interest expenses and depreciation charges can't simply be ignored. Depreciation and interest charges eat up over $1.4 billion of the EBITDA number leaving limited income for an enterprise value totaling over $50 billion.The volatile numbers really bring into question the estimate for T-Mobile earning $1.90 next year. The number was already slashed from 2.10 only seven days ago. If one was comfortable with the company earning close to $2 next year, the stock is interesting below $40. If not, it gets very difficult to justify the price outside of a merger from the likes of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (CMCSK) or DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) that are both mildly interested in being serious wireless providers.The key takeaway is that the CEO is entertaining to watch and he has done a great job of positioning T-Mobile into the spotlight, but it doesn't mean that the stock is attractive at prices around $38. The wireless provider is still struggling to prove that it can generate consistent free cash flows or large levels of income. The ability to attract industry leading customer additions isn't the same as attracting highly profitable customers."
3508446,24663,2015-09-14T10:32:00-04:00,"Sprint and T-Mobile investors are excited about the prospects that both carriers will see a boost in new subscribers during Apple's iPhone refresh.The reason is because of how aggressive both carriers have been with their leasing program.However, leasing brings about some serious questions regarding longevity and costs for both carriers.In fact, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus launch will likely unveil those problems to investors quickly, thereby putting pressure on both stocks.","Over this last weekend, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) begun pre-orders for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, and almost certainly, the numbers will be huge. However, in the midst of Apple selling millions of new iPhones, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) look to lure more AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) iPhone customers by offering some of the most enticing deals in the history of U.S. telecommunications services. While I and most analysts believe that both T-Mobile and Sprint will be successful in attracting new iPhone users, it also is very likely that investors will get to see first hand the big long-term problem that T-Mobile and Sprint are sure to encounter thanks to such aggressive promotions. In other words, Sprint and T-Mobile may add new customers, but it will be at a huge long-term cost.What are these aggressive promotions? First off, it starts with leasing. T-Mobile and Sprint have essentially moved away from the two-year upgrade cycle where customers pay $200 to $400 upfront for the device and are locked into a two-year contract. Nowadays, Sprint and T-Mobile have leasing plans that allow customers to upgrade their phones at least once a year. Those customers then pay a monthly lease payment and return their phone at the end of the lease in exchange for a new device. For customers who are leaving AT&T or Verizon, both Sprint and T-Mobile will pay your penalty fees to switch.Here is an article that details leasing and its growing popularity in the U.S.With the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, T-Mobile has unveiled a plan to pay up to $650 of a competing carrier's fees for customers to switch. It also announced a lifetime coverage satisfaction guarantee where it will refund iPhone 6s, 6s Plus customers their fees plus unlock the phone so it can be used at a competing carrier if dissatisfied with their T-Mobile services. Notably, Sprint offers a similar service. As for actual lease prices, Sprint customers who switch and trade-in their existing phone will pay just $15 per month for an iPhone 6s. With no trade-in, Sprint charges $22 and $26 for iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, respectively. T-Mobile charges its customers $20 a month for the 6s model.Nonetheless, all these things sound great, but at the core, the underlying issue is that these prices don't pay for the device, and Apple is not offering Sprint or T-Mobile a discount. In my opinion, Sprint appears to be the most aggressive with its pricing, and like T-Mobile, offers upgrade options where customers can get a new iPhone every year. However, both Sprint and T-Mobile's leasing programs are structured on an 18-month term, although both carriers allow upgrades sooner via recent promotions. So, in looking at T-Mobile's plan, customers pay $20 a the base model of Apple's iPhone 6s. Over 18 months that's only $360 of the unit's $649 price tag.Further, once that 18-month term is complete, T-Mobile offers customers a buyout price of $164. That equals $524, still $125 off the list price of that iPhone. With that said, there are countless variations of pricing, terms, iPhone models, etc. involved with these plans offered by T-Mobile and Sprint, but you get the picture. The point is that each plan offered leaves T-Mobile and Sprint responsible for some of the iPhone's cost, and quite a bit at that. When you consider the millions of customers that both T-Mobile and Sprint have that are iPhone users, that $125 to $290 cost that the carrier gets stuck with adds up fast.Now, had Sprint or T-Mobile left its data rate charges and plan pricing alone over the last year, and were only affected by hardware related costs following the lease term, then it would not be that big of a problem. However, thanks to previous promotions related to service plans and data packages, T-Mobile's trailing 12-month operating margin has fallen more than 75% to just 3.8% over the last five years. And Sprint is nowhere near profitable, having a free cash flow loss of well over $5 billion during the last year. T-Mobile's free cash flow is negative $2.9 billion over the same span.S Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsAlbeit, T-Mobile and Sprint may add new customers during this iPhone refresh, but they are not profitable customers. Over the last few quarters we have seen both Sprint and T-Mobile blame hardware costs (smartphones) for rising expenses as both companies must now purchase the phones and do not receive as much income upfront when sold. Unfortunately, this will be an ongoing trend as leasing phones will require T-Mobile and Sprint to make such purchases on an annual basis when Apple refreshes the iPhone. Sprint and T-Mobile will then be left to answer the billion-dollar question of what to do with all that excessive inventory at every iPhone refresh.This is a question that no Sprint or T-Mobile investors has seemingly asked in recent months, and a question that no executive has answered either. Investors seem so excited by subscriber growth that they have failed to determine whether T-Mobile and Sprint are acquiring subs at a gain or loss. Moreover, investors aren't considering the common sense of supply and demand. Specifically, what becomes of all those iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models once millions of customers upgrade to the 6s and 6s Plus? There is going to be so much supply of these models and neither carrier has unveiled where the demand exists.Sure, T-Mobile and Sprint may try to sell those iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models at an unlocked, used discount, but with subscribers able to lease the newest phones for just $20 per month, why pay nearly $300 so T-Mobile or Sprint can break even on the price of that older device? Another possibility is that Sprint or T-Mobile will try and sell the components of traded in, or used hardware. However, as seen with the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, the components see major upgrades on an annual basis, and those chips found in the 6 and 6 Plus are now outdated and inferior products, even for high-end popular Android devices.Nonetheless, Sprint and T-Mobile are likely to take a huge loss on incoming iPhone 6 and 6 Plus used inventory, and then next year when the iPhone 7 models are unveiled, the carriers will take a big hit on the 6s and 6s Plus. This is an enormous problem with leasing that I don't think investors have considered but will be unveiled in the coming months as expenses remain high thanks to the iPhone refresh.Ideally, Sprint and T-Mobile will be able to divest older iPhones once customers upgrade to the newest models, thereby creating additional revenue and softening the blow that comes with having to pay upfront expenses on all those iPhone 6s and 6s Plus units. However, I don't think the demand will be present. I expect for Sprint and T-Mobile to be stuck with an obscene inventory of older iPhones as upgrades begin. If so, T-Mobile and Sprint will be forced to lower the wholesale, unlocked price of used iPhones until supply and demand meet in the middle. The end result could very well be buying an iPhone 5, 6 and or 6 Plus for the price of a GoPhone six months from now, and both Sprint and T-Mobile investors realizing that today's very aggressive promotions and current leasing prices in general do not support a sustainable business model. The end result is lower stock prices, if in fact demand for those older phones is not established."
3440376,69965,2015-08-14T10:31:54-04:00,"T-Mobile's service revenue growth tells a story, are investors listening?T-Mobile's ""un-carrier"" revolution is a real threat to all 3 of its peers.The good news for T-Mobile is the company can still grow earnings significantly by improving this one metric.","Just a few years ago, the wireless industry was a choice between a contract with a large mobile carrier, or prepaid service with no contract. In the last few years, major carriers from AT&T (NYSE:T) to T-Mobile U.S. (NASDAQ:TMUS) have moved away from contracts, and toward no subsidy handsets. If investors want to buy the current leader in postpaid customers, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is the clear choice with over 100 million postpaid connections. However, there is an argument to be made that T-Mobile could be the real winner in this new paradigm.A more than serviceable numberThe movement away from contract plans has two clear consequences. First, customers have shown that they will only accept no-subsidy phones if they are given a discounted rate plan. Service providers are willing to take a hit in service plan pricing in order to entice customers to go without a subsidy. Second, since carriers are selling or leasing the equipment, this shift is creating growth in equipment revenue.Looking at the four major carriers, the difference in service revenue growth is startling. Sprint (NYSE:S) is cutting prices to try and lure customers from its rivals, and it shows in the company's service revenue. On a year-over-year basis, Sprint's service revenue declined by more than 8%. Verizon and AT&T, witnessed declines as well, with annual service revenue down 2.2% and 0.2% respectively.T-Mobile on the other hand, not only reported positive service revenue growth, but an increase of 12% year-over-year. Of the four major carriers, only T-Mobile was able to strike the right balance of customer growth, combined with increasingly competitive plan pricing.On the equipment side of things, the split between the large carriers is just as pronounced. Verizon's sheer size, drove the company's huge equipment revenue growth of more than 60% annually. At the extreme other end of the spectrum, Sprint's customer losses hurt equipment revenue, showing a decline of 10% versus last year.In the middle of the pack, AT&T and T-Mobile both witnessed decent equipment annual revenue growth of 15% and 20% respectively. T-Mobile's outperformance in service revenue, combined with strong equipment revenue growth, shows the company understands how to win in this new wireless world.A very real threat to the bigger carriersIt's one thing for Sprint to ask customers to switch so they can cut their bills in half. It sounds great for Verizon to trumpet its superior network. AT&T's recent acquisition of DirecTV is prompting some very aggressive offers, of $300 for switching, and up to $200 for each trade-in. Even as impressive as these options are, customers are moving to T-Mobile from these carriers, and the company has the data to prove it.T-Mobile's porting figures, give teeth to the idea of the ""un-carrier"" revolution. John Legere, T-Mobile's CEO said, ""in six quarters…the porting has been positive against every single carrier."" More specifically, he said T-Mobile's porting numbers were, ""1.5 to Verizon, 1.9 with AT&T, and 2.45 with Sprint.""T-Mobile and Sprint each have around 30 million postpaid customers. The fact that T-Mobile gets more than 2 customers for every one going to Sprint, suggests T-Mobile's push to solidify its third place position is very likely.In addition, AT&T should be very worried if these porting numbers continue. AT&T has more than twice the postpaid customers relative to T-Mobile. However, with T-Mobile gaining customers at nearly twice the rate, a push toward the number two spot could come more quickly than some might think.A long runway for growthAs we've seen, T-Mobile is growing service and equipment revenue, and is taking customers from its competition at an impressive ratio. While these positive factors might be enough to make T-Mobile a buy, there is a risk/reward when it comes to the company's operating margin.If there was ever an industry where size matters, it's the wireless business. It's hard to paint a clearer picture of the cause and effect, of size versus operating margin, across the wireless industry. Verizon is the clear leader in postpaid wireless subscribers, and its operating margin proves this at 34%. AT&T comes in second place, and its operating margin of 26% is impressive as well.At a different tier in the wireless game, are T-Mobile and Sprint. Both companies have around 30 million postpaid subscribers, yet T-Mobile's operating margin of 7.3% is slightly higher than Sprint's margin of 6.2%. There are two pieces to this puzzle.First, both T-Mobile and Sprint have a significant number of prepaid subscribers. These prepaid customers generally are lower margin accounts than postpaid. Second, prepaid customers have a higher churn rate.The good news for T-Mobile is, if its postpaid customer additions continue, its operating margin should, in theory, move higher. Postpaid customers tend to be higher margin accounts than prepaid. The challenge, of course, will be to keep the prepaid customer base happy, even while focusing more on growing postpaid connections.In the end, T-Mobile seems to have the keys to the new wireless world. The company is growing service revenue, equipment revenue, and porting customers at a positive ratio to each of its peers. If T-Mobile continues on this path, the ""un-carrier,"" could be the only carrier investors should pay attention to."
3339575,24491,2015-07-20T14:45:15-04:00,"T-Mobile's first-quarter results were stellar. The firm posted its 8th consecutive quarter of more than 1 million customer additions and showed industry-leading growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA.The firm faces intense competition. Its innovative Un-carrier plan has revealed great momentum since its inception, but it has yet to be proven in an economic downturn.T-Mobile continued its record-low churn rate of 1.3%, according to preliminary second-quarter results.Let's take a look at the firm's investment prospects and determine a fair value estimate.","By Brandon UtesT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) had a remarkable year in 2014. In the year, the budding telecom company became America's fastest growing wireless company and America's fastest nationwide 4G LTE network. The firm's innovative Un-carrier plan set the table for growth when it was released in 2013. During 2014, T-Mobile delivered its best customer growth in its history. The firm added over 8.3 million customers, had three of four quarters with over two million net adds, and grew its US postpaid phone growth by nearly 100% during the year. Customer growth generated strong financials for the year. Total revenue advanced 13.1%, service revenue increased 9%, and adjusted EBITDA grew 6% in 2014.Despite its historic year, T-Mobile still faces intense competition in the industry and has yet to test its newfound success in an economic downturn. The firm had not done as well as it could before the release of its Un-carrier plan, and such a plan has yet to see weaker times. Its bigger competitors' networks are still considerably larger than its own. Furthermore, margins are worth paying close attention to: T-Mobile's adjusted EBITDA margin has decreased to 25% in 2014 from 28% in 2012 as it continues to expand its core business and network.Even though intense competition lingers, T-Mobile continued its success through the first fiscal quarter of 2015 and into its 2015 preliminary fiscal second quarter. Customers continue to flock to T-Mobile to enjoy the freedom the company provides. The firm's second-quarter preliminary results reported the addition of 2.1 million customers, marking the 9th consecutive quarter with over 1 million customer additions. The firm also posted a record-low post-paid phone churn rate of 1.3% during the period. T-Mobile also introduced an industry-changing dynamic in the quarter with its ""Mobile without Borders"". Its upgrade makes Simple Choice the first and only wireless plan to span an entire continent as it extends coverage and calling across US, Canada, and Mexico at no extra charge.Competitors have taken notice of T-Mobile's success, and talks of an acquisition have been prevalent in the past. Raising its subscriber outlook while delivering strong growth in adjusted EBITDA will continue to be the main goal for T-Mobile. Let's take a look at the company's investment considerations beyond its most recent developments and derive a fair value estimate.T-Mobile's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• T-Mobile is a participant in the US wireless industry and lists Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) as its parent. The firm's spectrum resources are expected to enable at least 20+20 MHz LTE in approximately 90% of top 25 metro areas by 2014+. T-Mobile competes heavily with AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and Sprint (NYSE:S).• Consolidation in the US wireless space has heated up. According to reports, Sprint had been considering a deal to acquire T-Mobile for $40 per share in cash and stock. America Movil (NYSE:AMX) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (CMCSK) have been rumored to be interested in T-Mobile, and France's Iliad (OTCPK:ILIAF) made a bid.• In 2014, Sprint reportedly had lined up eight banks to finance the speculated deal with T-Mobile. The financing package had reportedly been $40+ billion and included a bridge loan of ~$20 billion from Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBY) to Sprint. Talks have since ceased but they may re-emerge at a later date, however.• T-Mobile is the fastest-growing wireless company in America. The company consistently adds over a million net adds each quarter, and more recently it has been achieving record-low churn rates. This may be more of a function of the strong economy, however, and such strength may wane during weak times.• T-Mobile's stock price doesn't quite reflect a take-out premium, perhaps indicating increased skepticism about a potential merger. We're monitoring developments closely and have recently removed an embedded takeout premium in our valuation.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. T-Mobile's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 3.1%, which is below the estimate of its cost of capital of 8.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of POOR.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. We don't assign the firm an attractive Economic Castle rating, but we're expecting improvement.Cash Flow AnalysisFree cash flow has been abysmal but improving in recent years at T-Mobile. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. T-Mobile's free cash flow margin has averaged about -11.2% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively WEAK.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At T-Mobile, cash flow from operations moved into positive territory from levels two years ago, as capital expenditures expanded about 414% during this time period.In the first quarter of 2015, T-Mobile reported cash from operations of $489 million and capital expenditures of $982 million, resulting in negative free cash flow of $493 million.Valuation AnalysisThis is the most important aspect of our analysis. Below, we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate for shares.Our discounted cash flow model indicates that T-Mobile's shares are worth between $30-$46 each. Shares are currently trading at ~$39, just above our fair value estimate. This indicates that we feel there is nearly the same amount of downside risk as upside potential associated with shares at this time.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $38 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 155 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 7.3% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3- year historical compound annual growth rate of 14.5%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 10.7%, which is above T-Mobile's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 4.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For T-Mobile, we use an 8.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisEach fair value estimate we provide comes with a fair value range, within which we feel the company is fairly valued. Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $38 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for T-Mobile. We think the firm is attractive below $30 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $46 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate TMUS's fair value at this point in time to be about $38 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of T-Mobile's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $52 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $38 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpWe think T-Mobile has its fair share of investment merits, and it is the fastest growing wireless company in America amid significant industry reconsolidation. Competitors have taken notice of the firm's rapidly-growing network, and as recently as 2014, serious talks were taking place. However, the firm's shares no longer reflect a takeout premium, in our view, indicating the resilience of the firm's share price on a standalone basis.Despite outstanding top-line and customer growth numbers, we do not see T-Mobile as a solid investment idea at this time. We need to see shares trading at a significant discount to our fair value estimate, as well as drastic improvement in its relative valuation before considering a position. T-Mobile currently registers a 6 on the Valuentum Buying Index."
3319265,22148,2015-07-13T19:48:01-04:00,T-Mobile announced the addition of 2.1 million customers during Q215.The company continues to lead domestic wireless providers in both service revenue growth and stock gains.T-Mobile remains expensive considering the general inability to turn customer additions into consistent profits.,"In the domestic wireless pricing war, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) remains the big winner. The stock has seen significant gains in the last couple of years while the other domestic providers struggled to reward shareholders. Both AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) saw small capital losses that were offset by solid dividends while Sprint (NYSE:S) collapsed.TMUS data by YChartsThe latest news that T-Mobile added 2.1 million customers during Q2 suggests the above trend might continue. After all, the wireless provider has parlayed market leading customer additions to profit expectations and hence the stock gains. The interesting note though is that the company hasn't exactly generated those actual profits despite better customer additions and a few profitable quarters here and there.As the below chart on service revenue growth that's loosely related to customer additions in the important postpaid category shows, the stock gains somewhat mirror the revenue growth in this category. T-Mobile has led the way with growth while Sprint is lagging the group with substantial losses.Source: T-Mobile Q115 earnings presentationDespite the general correlation between the stock price and the service revenue growth, T-Mobile is still struggling to reach consistent profitability. The wireless provider has turned in losses in two of the last three quarters after a blowout profit last Q2.Source: Yahoo FinanceUltimately, the stock is gaining partially due to high expectations for 2016 earnings. Analysts expect T-Mobile to earn $1.89 per share for the year, up from $1.75 roughly 90 days ago. For 2015, analyst estimates are declining as higher customer additions are leading to more costs. The estimate is now for T-Mobile earning $0.74 this year, up from only $0.30 in 2014.Part of the theory for large earnings in the future is that promotions to add these new customers this year will have far less impact on results in 2016. The last three quarters suggest that is a misnomer considering the theory in 2014 was similar.The key takeaway is that T-Mobile continues to promise that a customer added today will lead to profits tomorrow. The wireless provider has far exceeded any expectations, but it needs to start producing actual profits to justify a price approaching $40."
3268795,24663,2015-06-18T16:58:04-04:00,"TMUS CEO John Legere tweeted a chart of just how wide the disconnect is for spectrum among U.S. wireless companies.DISH is reportedly nearing an acquisition of TMUS, but other companies also are rumored to be interested.TMUS needs DISH, and vise versa, but it is going to be hard for DISH to pull it off.","DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) is reportedly trying to get the cash together to purchase T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). However, after years of using debt to fund prior investments, it is going to be hard for DISH Network to absorb a company of similar valuation. While analysts have noted on several occasions the synergies and benefit of a T-Mobile tieup, a recent chart by John Legere perfectly illustrates why it is so important.Anyone who has followed T-Mobile CEO John Legere on Twitter knows that he's working overtime to end the ""duopoly"" and the FCC's willingness to allow an unfair advantage for Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). Legere claims that much of the AT&T and Verizon duopoly is possible because of A) their ability to outbid all other carriers on spectrum and B) the head start that both companies were given when the FCC gave the carriers large chunks of spectrum several years back. Regardless if you agree or disagree with Legere's request for a level playing field with spectrum, the following chart can not be denied.Source: John Legere TwitterAs seen above, T-Mobile desperately needs spectrum. DISH Network has that spectrum and desperately needs to deploy it. As a result, DISH Network and T-Mobile need each other badly, and need to act fast.The reason that DISH Network needs to act fast is very simple: DISH Network has a deadline in place where 40% of its AWS-4 spectrum must be connected to mobile devices by 2017. While that seems far out, two years is not that long when the FCC and other local regulatory agencies are involved. Not to mention, if DISH were to acquire T-Mobile, it would have to deploy that spectrum and make the networks compatible.Fact of the matter is that DISH Network has an asset that I value at $25 billion plus, the majority of DISH's valuation, that could theoretically be deemed worthless if it's not connected to mobile devices. T-Mobile's need for a DISH tieup is evident in Legere's chart: With mobile data consumption expected to grow at a compound annualized rate of 57% from 2014 till 2019, T-Mobile's network is going to get congested due to limited spectrum. That's unless it can suddenly afford to match AT&T and Verizon penny for penny in future spectrum auctions.As a result, there's added incentive for both T-Mobile and DISH Network to get a deal done as soon as possible. I said several months ago that I expect a deal sooner rather than later, and with Verizon and AT&T's network getting an upgrade from recent spectrum wins in Auction 97, and rumors circulating that cable companies could be interested in T-Mobile, I expect a deal to be announced very soon. If so, investors should be very excited about the prospects that a combined company could create in both the TV and wireless space."
3317735,80285,2015-07-10T19:25:28-04:00,"T-Mobile's subscriber base has been growing at an astonishing rate.Churn has been dropping steadily, indicating greater customer retention.Lack of profitability and high expenses are not major concerns.","On Thursday, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported that it added a massive 2.1 million subscribers in the latest quarter, with branded postpaid churn reaching a record-low 1.3%. Its continued onslaught in the wireless market began two years ago, when the company unveiled its revolutionary ""Un-carrier"" programme to challenge the traditional contract-based model in the telecom industry. Since then, T-Mobile has become the maverick among the Big Four carriers, with the subscriber base growing at a phenomenal pace, on track to overtake Sprint (NYSE:S) as the third largest US carrier.Despite the issues with profitability due to stagnant earnings and free cash flow growth, these issues are not a major concern, as TMUS continues to acquire loyal customers on a net cash positive basis.T-Mobile's Un-carrier ModelBack in March 2013, T-Mobile first unveiled Un-carrier 1.0: it would completely do away with contracts and establish a phone-leasing model instead. It was marketed to consumers as a way to get out of restrictive, costly 2-year plans, giving them more freedom and choice. This would set the path for T-Mobile's strategy, challenging Sprint, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) for market share. Seven iterations later, T-Mobile has made significant gains under the leadership of its aggressive CEO John Legere.Despite being the smallest carrier out of the Big Four, T-Mobile's postpaid handset additions have been growing the fastest on both an absolute and percentage basis. This attests to the effectiveness of its ""no-contract"" strategy.Including other devices such as tablet additions, T-Mobile is still punching above its weight, as growth is on a steady upward trajectory.Postpaid churn has also declined steadily since Q1 2013, indicating that TMUS has been retaining customers much more effectively compared to its closest peer, Sprint, which still holds the unenviable position of having the highest churn in the industry.What has driven T-Mobile's overall success? We know clearly it is not due to price, because Sprint offers much cheaper prices, yet it continues to have a significant number of defectors every quarter. I believe the key to its growth has been a great marketing campaign and the ability to craft an attractive value proposition while making moderate improvements to its network quality. This combination has propelled the company forward and will continue to boost customer growth.Moreover, T-Mobile has been extremely savvy about the way its value proposition is framed. For instance, the company promises that rates on existing plans will never go up, whereas Unlimited Data Plans have a guaranteed rate for at least two years. However, TMUS knows that this will not decrease future profitability. This is because the average costs to provide data for each individual subscriber decreases as the subscriber base expands, due to greater economies of scale. Also, as technology enables more efficient cell towers and telecom operations, costs are likely to be driven down. This is evident from the decreasing price of data plans over time, compared to when it first emerged as a new technology.The true driver of profitability for handset data providers like T-Mobile will be the upward trend in average data usage, which means subscribers are more likely to migrate to plans with a higher data threshold over time, thus leading to high fees and profits for T-Mobile. This is also why TMUS did not guarantee the same rate forever for its Unlimited Data Plan. Thus, by advertising that promise to subscribers, it gained a positive and consumer-centric image at almost no additional cost.Furthermore, T-Mobile frames its value proposition in abstract terms such as giving consumers ""freedom"" from stifling plans, telling them they don't have to ""settle"" for high-priced plans. This has created a strong appeal, particularly for customers who have been disenchanted with their traditional wireless plans.While T-Mobile has a superior value proposition, it struggles with the bottom line.Lack Of Profitability Despite Subscriber GrowthThis point is essentially the bear case against T-Mobile - that customer growth means nothing if it does not lift profits.Free cash flow has fallen off a cliff due to the high CAPEX spending on network upgrading and purchasing wireless licenses. However, even when we exclude the cost of purchasing spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, free cash flow is still slightly in the red.Moreover, given that T-Mobile is in the process of building out its network to utilize the 700-MHZ spectrum acquired from Verizon, CAPEX is expected to increase.Another point to consider would be the early termination fees that TMUS is offering to pay for all new customers who switch to their network. For FY2014, this figure was $58M, which is nearly half of its net profit for the entire year.To understand why these problems are not a concern, we have to decipher T-Mobile's strategy further. The early termination fees raises its customer acquisition cost, but only up to the point where TMUS is still acquiring subscribers on a net positive basis, assuming subscribers stay with it for a certain period of time.Paying to gain customers is fine as long as these new customers stay loyal. The trend of lower churn rates shows that T-Mobile has indeed become more successful in retaining subscribers, and hence is able to monetize its wider user base over a longer period of time. Given that churn is steadily dropping, the data confirms that T-Mobile's strategy is paying off.ConclusionAs long as the company continues on its current path, offering an attractive value proposition and gaining loyal customers by the masses, it will continue making gains on competitors, most notably Sprint, which continue to lose subscribers every quarter. Whilst achieving greater profitability may take a longer time, the astounding pace of T-Mobile's growth should provide a significant boost to the share price, which has already been climbing."
3324565,25265,2015-07-15T11:59:39-04:00,T-Mobile is experiencing rapid growth because it chooses to sell at a lower price point.That lower price point means the company has yet to generate positive free cash flow on an annual basis.T-Mobile's valuation is stretched and priced for perfection; investors should avoid at these levels.,"With the M&A rumor mill swirling around T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), the stock has been on a tear this year, climbing 45% year-to-date. Most of the speculation centers on DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) merging with T-Mobile. DISH has spectrum that T-Mobile needs. DISH wants to diversify into wireless. All that makes sense. What doesn't make sense is the current market capitalization of T-Mobile. I believe the stock is significantly overvalued and do not believe an acquirer would pay much more than the current price for the company. Here is why:Some investors seem to confuse revenue growth with profit growth. If a company can grow revenues into perpetuity but fails to ever make a financial profit (I define that as positive free cash flow), its equity should be worth very little in my opinion. If I, as an owner of that company, have no ability to ever take profits out of the business, why should it be worth anything? Currently, T-Mobile reinvests all the cash it generates from operations back into its network, leaving nothing for shareholders.Now I certainly believe that T-Mobile deserves credit for thinking outside the box in wireless. It has disrupted the status quo of the traditional two-year contract business model with strict data limits, which has been great for consumers. The company has also made strides in improving its network, and consumers are responding favorably. T-Mobile is growing faster than all its rivals (on a percentage basis). But T-Mobile is only experiencing growth for one reason: it offers acceptable service at a lower price point than its rivals. Remarkably, Sprint (NYSE:S) scores higher than T-Mobile on network quality tests yet continues to shed customers to its smaller rival. T-Mobile has chosen to forego acceptable profit margins for the sake of revenue and subscriber growth. It even offers to buy new subscribers out of their contract (up to $650) to switch. That is very generous. Would Verizon (NYSE:VZ) or AT&T (NYSE:T) do such a thing? Not a chance; they are not that desperate for subscriber growth.Consensus estimates are for positive free cash flow the remainder of this year at T-Mobile on the back of some operating leverage and final synergies from the Metro PCS deal coming through. But the company has grown at a decent clip for some time now and has yet to post positive free cash flow. Why would investors put so much faith in future projections when the merged company has no history of positive FCF? Would it not be wiser to take a wait-and-see approach instead of bidding the stock up to a valuation well beyond that of its profitable rivals?Let's strip T-Mobile's operations down to cash, so everyone can see that it spends more than it takes in.Here are the last four quarters' operating results along with the next four projected results.Source: Company filingsOver the last 12 months, T-Mobile has printed impressive revenue growth but unimpressive -$476M free cash flow. Note that free cash flow is before spectrum purchases, which total $4.6B over the last 12 months. With no positive FCF, T-Mobile must borrow or draw down its cash balance to fund spectrum purchases. If this continues to be the case, what will be left for shareholders?Mountain of DebtThere is nearly $25B in debt sitting ahead of the $31B in T-Mobile shareholder equity on the balance sheet. Projections point to a rosier future; however, I see no reason to believe cash flow will improve to a level that will justify the current valuation anytime soon. The capex needs are constant. The company will need to purchase more costly spectrum every couple of years. Until the company significantly increases pricing or dramatically slows its customer acquisition costs, I believe it is appropriate to take a cautious view of free cash flow going forward.Let's contrast T-Mobile's financials that to the giants of the industry: Verizon and AT&T. These two rivals actually care about making a decent return on investment.Source: Company filingsThere is very weak history of FCF generation at T-Mobile. In its pre-Metro PCS days, the company did have a few years of positive FCF. From 2010 to 2012, it generated $680M of total FCF (not including spectrum buys). But that was back when this was a $5B enterprise, not a $53B enterprise. If this company is going to self-fund all of its capital needs, reduce leverage, and have some cash left over for shareholders, it really needs to consistently generate $2B+ in annual free cash flow. Unfortunately, this company has no history of doing that. So again, why give the company the benefit of the doubt that it can when the valuation is already stretched?To be fair, it should be noted that both Verizon and AT&T have other businesses besides wireless. Their legacy landline businesses carry higher margins, however, that is part of what makes both of these companies more attractive investments. They both generate ample free cash flow; T-Mobile generates none. Now let's look at valuations because this is where the T-Mobile bull thesis really starts to fall apart.Source: Company filingsFrom a valuation perspective, T-Mobile is already the most expensive (8.44x EV/EBITDA) of the three carriers; it is also the most levered (3.92x debt/EBITDA). I do not understand how this can be the case when its margins, customer size, and spectrum positioning are far inferior to its competition. Again, just because T-Mobile has solid revenue and subscriber growth that does not mean it will turn that into profits and ultimately healthy, consistent free cash flow. The stock is already significantly overvalued compared to its peers. As such, I find it difficult to believe an acquirer would pay much if any premium to the current price.So what is a fair value for T-Mobile? Absent a takeout by someone willing to pay a premium just to get into the wireless carrier business, I think the stock should trade at an EV/EBITDA multiple below that of both Verizon and AT&T. Both of these companies actually generate sizable free cash flow and T-Mobile does not. A generous multiple would be 6.5x, giving the company some credit for its topline and subscriber growth but maintaining health skepticism about the company's ability to generate positive FCF. A 6.5x multiple would put the equity fair value in the mid-$20/share range or approximately 38 percent lower than the current price. That is basically where the stock traded six months ago.In conclusion, I would caution longs that think a deal can get done at a significant premium to today's price. I do not understand why this company trades at a premium EV/EBITDA multiple to the two wireless leaders, Verizon and AT&T. It generates no free cash flow, meaning that after investing in the business to maintain adequate operations, there are no profits left for shareholders. So why own the stock of a company that generates no excess profits? I do not buy the argument that the company will soon turn the corner and start generating healthy free cash flow. Again, T-Mobile is not anywhere near the scale it needs to do that. If no deal happens and I'm right about continued weak cash flows, the stock will drift significantly lower. If you have ridden the stock up this far, I say congrats and maybe you should seriously consider lightening up on your position. There is no guarantee that an acquirer and T-Mobile will agree on a price. I suspect T-Mobile would still want a 10-15 percent premium above the current price. If talk of a deal fizzles, the stock can absolutely drift a lot lower because I think a lot of people are in the stock hoping that a deal takes place.While it is certainly possible that a deal gets done north of $40/share, I do not believe that alone would justify owning the stock at these levels. The risk versus reward is skewed to the downside for the simple fact that the company does not generate enough cash to self-fund its operations, let alone have any cash left to reduce debt or to return to shareholders. Its valuation is stretched well beyond that what it should be absent takeover rumors. Unless and until this company proves it can generate consistent free cash flow like its larger brethren, I would avoid it. It was okay to take a chance on the stock when it was in the $20s, but at the current price the stock is priced for perfection. I would not take that chance. Tread carefully. Good luck."
3528996,22148,2015-09-23T12:32:07-04:00,A suggested REIT for the network assets of Sprint and T-Mobile is highly unlikely.Recent examples of REIT spin offs aren't working well for shareholders.The higher network lease costs would not help Sprint solve current financial headaches despite the intended benefits of a better network.,"In theory, a combination of Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) makes all the sense in the world. The secondary domestic wireless providers would have the assets to compete more effectively with market leaders in AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ).The Department of Justice doesn't appear to agree with a reduction of the domestic providers to three so the point appears mute. Not to mention, the constant harassing of Sprint by the T-Mobile CEO probably makes a deal very unlikely.Regardless, a slew of analysts from Evercore ISI recommend that a combination that spins the network assets into a REIT makes perfect sense. This despite the recent telcom example in Windstream (WIN) and the prior move by Sears Holdings (SHLD) as prime examples of how the REIT spin off doesn't work in reality.The Evercore analysts are creative in suggesting that the wireless providers in effect stay independent with only the network assets combined to avoid regulatory scrutiny. The deal would allow Sprint and T-Mobile to have access to a combined spectrum of 255 MHz that greatly surpasses the 147 MHz of AT&T and the 116 MHz of Verizon.In theory, the deal would add value to Sprint and T-Mobile shareholders by creating a better network for both operators and improving the efficiency of one good network versus two sub-optimal networks.While the setup sounds interesting, the reality is that the public markets don't reward complex deals similar to this proposed one. The biggest issue faced by Sears and Windstream was the additional rent costs from the assets spun off. Suddenly, the non-REIT stocks faced the higher costs of renting space. Also, the REIT is completely reliant on a struggling company now paying substantial rent payments that contributes to increasing losses.If anybody questions the impact, a couple of pictures should alleviate the doubts. In the first example, Sears Holdings rebounded following the proposed spin off of real estate assets into a REIT. The stock quickly plummeted following the transfer of the assets in early June and it hasn't rebounded.In the next example, Windstream split out the network assets into a REIT back in April. Again, the stock absolutely collapsed following the deal as the extra rent payments pushed Windstream into a large loss.In the proposed scenario, Sprint would be the most impacted. The wireless provider continues producing quarterly losses and any additional expenses for network access from the REIT would only push the losses further into the red. In addition, T-Mobile is doing so well it isn't even clear the company would still want a deal.The key takeaway is that good intentions just don't work out when transferring assets into a REIT. Typically the situation only occurs for under performing stocks such as Sprint and the ending result is a struggling entity that now has to pay substantial rent payments. The REIT isn't any better off by a total reliance on a customer that isn't financially secure."
3318885,54942,2015-07-13T16:00:00-04:00,Rumors of a buyout of the firm continue to swirl as Dish and Comcast are likely vying for the firm- possibly creating a bidding war situation.The company continues to see strong momentum as acceptance of its industry-disruption strategies through the uncarrier program is taking share away from the other three.Valuation continues to improve as the prepaid program sees strong growth but is largely ignored by the market.,"Our T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) top idea from mid-April has covered a significant amount of ground towards our target price of $44 in just the last 2.5 months. We thought the shares were worth approximately one-third more than they were valued at the time and have since rallied by over 22%. The underlying performance of the carrier is attracting the attention of the larger two who are attempting to corner the market in low-band spectrum. T-Mobile continues to fight back with FCC actions but we see this as a long-term fight with many initial losses.Meanwhile, the valuation of the business continues to improve as the firm is seeing increased momentum in subs along with lower churn rates. This will have to be taken into consideration when an offer comes to the table given the long timetable of a suitable offer. Thus, we think the buyout offer in our prior write-up is too low and has to come in higher.Acquisition Talks Have Boosted Shares But Could Be DistractingOne of our summary bullet points in our prior write-up was the notion that there was a strong likelihood that the company would be acquired. As we suggested, the company was the only pure-play large-scale wireless company left and the fact that it has been experiencing strong growth only increases the target on their back.Not long after our analysis was published, news articles appeared detailing the interest by Dish Network in the company. Dish was one of the firms we speculated could be a bidder given their natural synergies and complements. Rumors of the possibility of a merger have been around for awhile but in mid-June, it was disclosed that Dish had been working with banks for the financing of a deal, including securing $10 to $15 billion for a larger cash portion of its bid.Given that they are actively working to secure financing, the merger talks with Deutsche Telekom AG, which owns 66% of the company, must be proceeding and they may be in later rounds of negotiations. The combined entity would command nearly $45 billion of revenue and $1.5 billion of profits. One of the thesis between a merger was the spectrum assets that Dish held, which are mostly un-utilized. The problem with a combined Dish and T-Mobile is that the spectrum Dish would add is similar to the type T-Mobile already owns. Dish doesn't own any low-band spectrum, which is what T-Mobile really needs in order to grow the company. Thus, we think the spectrum ""benefit"" from such a merger is overstated.Another rumor that circulated after the Dish merger bid was a potential acquisition by Comcast. A report circulated that they were in talks to potentially acquire the company in mid-June. Comcast likely wants to join AT&T and Verizon as cable operators with strong wireless assets. In addition, the DT CEO is rumored to want T-Mobile to be bought by Comcast. The CEO is concerned that a deal with Dish would end up making any later deal with Comcast constrained by the FCC and DOJ as we think the regulatory hurdles between a large satellite (one of only two) and the largest cable operator would easily get blocked.Fundamental Momentum Continues To AccelerateT-Mobile CEO Legere continues to disrupt the industry through his un-carrier program. We do not believe that the market is currently valuing the continued momentum acceleration that they experienced in the first quarter and appear to be showing again in the second. One of the things that appears to have gone unnoticed- as investors focus on buyout rumors and like political scandals, once those types of rumors are out, no one talks about anything else- is the dichotomy between T-Mobile and the three other major carriers in margins. Margins at T-Mobile continue to expand while Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T are seeing flat or declining margins.The sub gains that they are able to achieve continue to be impressive with 26.4% of gross adds in first quarter, up 120 bps from the fourth quarter. We see growth as being fueled by their un-carrier moves and their now strong data 4G network which is substantially better than just two years. They ended the first quarter with 275 million POPs of 4G LTE with the expectation to expand to 300 million by the end of this year.The change in the perception of mobile phone firms can take years, but we think they are making significant progress. Churn fell another 43 bps as the network upgrades are satisfying new users. One of the most staggering statistics we found was that the company's overall porting ratios (sub adds minus losses) have been positive every month against every carrier for the last five quarters.Low-Band's Importance Going ForwardWe see the next leg up coming from their roll-out of the low-band 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum which is now active in 55 markets. This is where the next big fight between T-Mobile and the big two (Verizon and AT&T) is setting up. Low-band is key for several reasons as the signals can penetrate structures like buildings, especially cement or concrete ones, more effectively when compared to the mid-band spectrum. It also has a longer range which means fewer cell towers and less capex. The capital efficiency is important as one macro of low-band is equivalent to three mid-band sites.In a filing with the FCC, T-Mobile is arguing that AT&T is promoting anti-competitive actions through the purchase of more low-band spectrum. The bank of low-band spectrum that AT&T and Verizon have are starting to block out the other players from gaining adequate low-band assets. The company is pushing the FCC to increase the amount of spectrum T-Mobile and smaller carriers can bid on in each market from a maximum of 30 MHz to at least 40 MHz. AT&T and Verizon, which has been excluded in many parts of the country because they have in excess of 45 MHz of low-band, have been fighting such a move.While we think T-Mobile will ultimately lose this fight, they may be setting themselves up for winning the war. A decision by the FCC is expected in the next few weeks. But even though we think the company will lose this ruling the continued raising of awareness over the issue of spectrum oligopoly is likely to eventually move the FCC to their side. Any eventual push by the regulatory body to restrict future spectrum sales to the big two is a large victory for T-Mobile.MetroPCS Prepaid Business Another Unsung AssetThe company's two-year anniversary of MetroPCS was last May and since then they've grown the prepaid business by a factor of three and are now the nation's largest prepaid carrier. Meanwhile, the MetroPCS integration has made significant progress with over 92% of the customer base already on the T-Mobile network and 80% of the spectrum reaffirmed for use on the T-Mobile infrastructure.The synergies from the deal are still being generated with the company now expecting $1.5 billion in annual run-rate operating expense savings by next year. Meanwhile, their prepaid business increased 41% in 2014 or $2 billion in revenue over 2013 driven by growth of the customer base from the expansion of the brand as they leverage the new parent company's resources. The success continues as consumers who use limited amount of mobile services want a lower-cost solution.ValuationGiven the move in the share price over the last few months, the shares have been distinctly re-rated. But we think this is buyout rumor premium being built into the shares. Our contention is that the likelihood of an increasing premium over time will drive up the price as the underlying fundamental momentum continues to gain steam.Since the start of the year, the EV/EBITDA ratio has jumped from 7.0x to over 8.9x. At ~$39 per share, we believe the shares are trading at a current buyout premium. But given the length of time a deal emerging from Comcast or Dish Network is likely to take, we think the price will have to come up.(Source: Bloomberg)Our outlook on the non-buyout value of the business has improved since April as our intrinsic value calculation for year-end moved higher to nearly $47. This is up from our $44 assessment as the underlying business continues to gain momentum- better than we expected and well ahead of the Street- but the market continues to focus on the merger. As we noted, the buyout premium is the buyout premium and that is what the shares will be worth if an offer is accepted by shareholders. But the longer it takes a true offer to materialize, the larger the premium Deutsche Telekom (as majority owner) will likely require as the business turnaround becomes more successful each quarter.ConclusionOur thesis on T-Mobile came to quick fruition but we think there is still significant meat on the bone as a possible bidding war could erupt between Comcast and Dish Network in the coming months. But in some respect, the whole buyout-merger rumor is a distraction to the market which is partially missing the accelerating momentum in the underlying business. Given the better sub figures and lower churn, we think a bidder will have to come with a strong price- much higher than the current trading price, especially since an offer is likely several quarters away at this point."
3239536,70965,2015-06-05T14:59:47-04:00,T-Mobile and Dish are both trying to challenge the behemoths of their respective industries and broaden the scope of their businesses.A merger would give T-Mobile access to Dish's spectrum and content and would help Dish build out wireless and broadband in a shifting cable environment.We think the merger will happen - it makes too much sense for it not to and it's one of the only mergers in the space that makes regulatory sense.,"By Scott TzuNumerous outlets have been reporting that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) are in talks to merge, a deal that we think makes too much obvious sense for it not to happen. Dish's portfolio of spectrum makes it a great target for TMUS. DISH could take advantage of the wireless infrastructure and licenses that it has to hopefully ""strike while the iron is hot"" and adjust their business model going forward. They currently don't have the same broadband capabilities that cable companies like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (CMCSK) are falling back as on more customers switch from cable to streaming. This would allow DISH entry into this niche right as its on an upswing in popular adoption.T-Mobile is a mobile carrier that's trying to pull itself out of the doldrums to compete with big names like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Dish is a company trying to take on the behemoths of not only the major cable provides like Comcast and Time Warner (TWC), but also direct satellite competitors DirecTV (NYSE:DTV). Both companies are underdogs, of sorts, in their respective sectors. And both companies have been linked to one another; with a partnership deal between the two being, to us, a pretty obvious move.Unlike when companies like AT&T tried to make a buyout move for T-Mobile, we feel this combination could work based on both companies being small enough to not show up on regulator's radar.The stock of T-Mobile has had its bumps in the road over the last few years. It's now trading near $40 on speculation that a deal is going to get done. By the time the company was well adjusted to being public, around 2008, the business had already begun to shift course as carriers like Verizon and AT&T took the lead. Dish, on the other hand, has been providing its investors with nearly 300% returns in the short span of just five years. Both companies are on the hunt for aggressive ways to grow, get bigger, and compete with the bigger names in their sectors.The discussion over the two companies banding together has been ongoing for almost a year now.T-Mobile is a growing name in mobile that's trying to push up against companies like Verizon and AT&T. And it looks like they're doing a decent job of it. TMUS's CEO insisted on the company's last conference call that they're actually the third largest carrier in the U.S. when you don't count ""dead"" accounts which companies like Sprint continue counting for 6 months. T-Mobile also just inked a partnership with BlackBerry (BBRY), another page out of the ""pairing with other underdogs"" playbook.Continued speculation of the two companies merging has been an ongoing talking point this year, with other ""clues"" being dropped including hints from TMUS' CFO, who spoke kindly of Dish's CEO, Charlie Ergen earlier this year.As T-Mobile continues its full scale attack of the big names (have you seen the commercials?), DISH has also been getting it right recently. The company's SlingTV service (a streaming live TV service) drew 100,000 subscribers in its first month of operation. Sling offers networks like IFC, AMC, ESPN, TBS, CNN, Disney, and others. If the service can continue to grow at this rate, it's soon going to be talked about seriously when compared to other streaming video services. If you're browsing the web and are searching for anything having to do with streaming video, you're going to run into a Sling TV ad.Re/Code recentlpublished a new article pointing out that Sling had surpassed 250,000 subscribers and that it continues to grow aggressively. This equates to about $5 million/month in sales, the article points out. The traction is important, it shows DISH is getting in on the paradigm shift in the industry. T-Mobile would love to combined forces and both companies should be eager to get the best of one another.As DISH keeps doing the right things, T-Mobile needs the spectrum that DISH is capable of providing, as this arstechnica article points out,Eventually, we could see Sling moving in the same direction as other streamers and producing their own content. In the future, this could potentially be accessible to T-Mobile as well. In addition, Sling International gives Dish access to international sporting events like cricket and soccer, which could be a selling point for mobile customers that are on a budget, which fits TMUS' customer profile. Of course, mobile licensing is a different animal than television, and Dish and T-Mobile would have to work through the necessary steps to push this content down to mobile in the case of a merger.DISH network would also just love to have access to T-Mobile's customer base. As the company gets hungrier for growth, not just for SlingTV, one thing it needs is a concentrated set of similar customers that are in the same, money saving mindset and demographic. This taps directly into the ""un-carrier"" T-Mobile's ""alternative"" customer base that choose not to go with one of the big name providers. T-Mobile's customer profile seems to be, by their advertising and position in the market, in line with Dish's.All of these merger rumors were born from T-Mobiles outspoken CEO John Legere making commentary saying that the merger would ""make some sense."" That has helped keep the discussion alive and wheels turning on Wall Street since early in 2015.While there have also been rumors of companies like Comcast taking a look at T-Mobile as some of the bigger names look to expand their outreach to customers into mobile, we still think the Dish/T-Mobile deal has too many synergies not to happen and judging by what we've heard from both companies, it could be on its way. From a regulatory standpoint, it seems the most likely.As it's been with many rumors we've followed about acquisition; if it makes an awful lot of sense, it's generally going to go the pragmatic way. We saw this with Office Depot and Staples just months ago when it looked like a deal wasn't going to happen. Sometimes, it just makes too much sense for it not to happen. This is the case we think we're seeing with Dish and T-Mobile. For us, it's not a question of ""if"", it's a question of ""when""."
3238756,24276,2015-06-05T09:36:12-04:00,DISH Network won the latest spectrum auction with a financial maneuver that may be overturned.DISH is not now a mobile operator. T-Mobile would make it one.DISH may be talking up the combination so it can sell most of it to public investors.,"While most analysts are salivating over the possibility of DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) merging with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), looking at the competitive value of the combination, or about how to arbitrage the ongoing talks, this could also be moving fast because it has to, owing to a scandal over the recent FCC spectrum auction.There is no doubt that the spectrum bought by DISH is the prize here. It was the second-largest buyer after AT&T (NYSE:T). It is not currently a wireless phone company, but buying T-Mobile, which is hungry for spectrum, would make it one. DISH CEO Charles Ergen is a motivated buyer.But the DISH use of a small business shell, called a ""designated entity,"" allowed it to buy this spectrum with a 25% discount, worth $3.3 billion, is leading to protests across the political spectrum. Capital Alpha Partners advised DISH in April that it shouldn't challenge an FCC decision against the discount in court.The question then becomes, where does DISH get $13.3 billion? Its balance sheet, showing $14.4 billion in debt covering $22.9 billion in assets, would already be stretched with another $10 billion - there is only $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments on the books - but $13.3 billion?On the other hand, T-Mobile has $56.6 billion in assets, with long-term debt of $18.7 billion. The combined company would be able to handle the expense.Both players need to swallow the new DISH spectrum with minimum fuss and leverage in order to prepare for yet another auction, currently scheduled for next year, covering low-frequency spectrum that would let the winner easily cover geographic weaknesses in their current network, since lower-frequency waves travel further. Dish, Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile are already cooperating in an effort called Save Wireless Choice that wants 40 MHz of the new spectrum ""reserved"" - kept away from Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T - which together control most of the market.The next problem is that Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY), which owns 66% of T-Mobile US, has long been interested in reducing its stake in the company, not increasing it. It tried to get out last year by selling to Sprint but that was thwarted and would doubtless have to take more stock in a DISH deal.This is where Ergen has to become the world's greatest salesman. He'll have to convince the Germans that he should get a controlling interest in the final deal - DISH has a market cap of $32.8 billion against $31.9 billion for TMUS - or that he can lay off a big piece of the deal, and the Deutsche Telekom exposure, either through private equity or another stock offering.That's possible in today's overheated market, but that may also be why this deal has become public knowledge well before it closed. Ergen needs to whet the public investor appetite not just for this deal, but for the huge offering of securities to come, aimed at giving him control of the final entity and its huge spectrum haul.Ergen's next fast one, in other words, may have already begun to play out, and it is aimed at you."
3235726,88266,2015-06-04T09:01:54-04:00,"Wall Street Journal reported what many have been expecting, a T-Mobile - Dish merger is in the works.Still many barriers to any merger becoming a reality.A T-Mobile - Dish combination would be very powerful.","The Wall Street Journal has reported what many have speculated for months, that a T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) - Dish (NASDAQ:DISH) merger is finally in the works. The Wall Street journal reports that while exact pricing has not been worked out current T-Mobile CEO John Legre would become the CEO of the combined company while Dish CEO Charlie Ergen would become the chairman.MergerT-Mobile is the 4th largest network in the USA, serving 56.8 million customers and known for its un-carrier movement which drops contracts, subsidized phones, data overage fees and early termination fees. It is 66% owned by Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) who has been looking to offload T-Mobile for some time now. Dish is a provider of satellite TV, satellite phone and internet television services in the United States. A merger would create a $60+ billion company similar to what AT&T (NYSE:T) accomplished with its purchase of DirecTV (NYSE:DTV).There are many things to take in with this merger rumor. Neither company is stranger to mergers, with Dish trying to buy out Sprint (NYSE:S) previously and T-Mobile previously planning to merge with Sprint and before that be bought out by AT&T. Both deals got rejected by regulators. So the question is will this one be any different? It is likely that regulators would in fact approve this deal since it leaves the wireless market intact with 4 players, while strengthening one of the weaker ones, T-Mobile. Despite this the deal will likely face an extensive regulatory review that could potentially bring up many other hurdles along the way.How to profit from the merger?Typically in a merger like this the safest company to buy would be T-Mobile because it will likely receive a breakup fee if the deal does not go through. T-Mobile has been a fast growing player in the US wireless industry and added 4 million users in 2014, accounting for 100% of the industries post-paid additions in 2014. Dish on the other hand has been steadily losing users as more and more customers ditch satellite TV for streaming services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Hulu. T-Mobile stock also has favorable EPS growth in the coming years. Due to this I believe T-Mobile has better fundamentals long term, so if something were to happen to the deal I would not mind being stuck with T-Mobile stock but would not want to be holding Dish.Should you buy?The answer to this depends on your timeline. Many reports suggest the price Dish will pay for T-Mobile will be $40, or in the low $40s which the stock is approaching as of writing this article in pre market trading. Dish CEO Charlie Ergen is known as being a tough negotiator and difficult to work with so T-Mobile shareholders should not expect Dish to pay anything just to buy T-Mobile. Dish has bought up a lot of mobile spectrum and is required to begin using it within the next year or so, but other options exist and Dish could consider a partnership with Sprint if the price is not right with T-Mobile. If you are in it for the long run I think T-Mobile is a great buy and I think a combined company plus all the synergies that would come with it would be a very powerful force, especially with John Legre at the helm as he has proven to be an aggressive winner with T-Mobile.Potential RisksThere are still a few risks to any potential merger. Regulators could crush the deal potentially, however this is less likely than it was in past deals involving T-Mobile. Minority shareholders may not be happy with a price that Dish proposes considering T-Mobile has done well on its own, and it may derail T-Mobile's momentum in the near term. Sprint could make an aggressive offer to Dish to entice them into working with them instead or the deal may simply fall apart before any more information becomes public."
3178716,78265,2015-05-14T10:12:09-04:00,"We believe T-Mobile investors are too optimistic about its future. This optimism is expressed in a price that's unsustainable in our view.In particular, the difference between forward PE guesstimates and the trailing twelve month PE multiple suggests the market is exceedingly optimistic. Such optimism rarely works out well for small investors.Additionally, the company has a (slightly) negative relationship between revenue and net income and a very risky capital structure. Shares may rise further on the wings of optimism, but avoid for now.","To paraphrase one of the greatest movies of all time, ""the first rule of investing is: you do not lose money. The second rule of investing is: you-do-not-lose-money."" It's with that in mind that we want to talk about T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). We want to remind investors that the more they pay for anything, the lower subsequent returns are going to be.T-Mobile has been growing its subscriber base aggressively for years, employing a ""grow market share by offering the least expensive solution around"" strategy and so far it has had the desired effect: the subscriber base has grown dramatically, but profitability remains thin in our view. In this article we're going to talk about the fact that having more unprofitable clients is actually not a positive for shareholders. In fact, if each client is actually costing you X amount of money per year, adding more of them is worse, not better. In this article, we'll focus less on the tumultuous relationship between T-Mobile and BlackBerry (BBRY) (as that's been well covered elsewhere) and instead we'll look at the relationship between current PE and forward PE, the relationship between revenue and net income at the firm and will conclude by looking briefly at the company's capital structure.Forward and Current PEWe like to unbundle the assumptions embedded in price to work out whether the market is being too optimistic or too pessimistic about a given company. One of the ways we do this is by comparing trailing twelve month (TTM) price earnings to projected forward price earnings and ask ourselves: ""what has to happen to earnings to line up the TTM PE and forward PE?"" We perform this exercise to work out how optimistic the market is toward a given name. We can then examine whether what the market is assuming will happen makes any sense or not. In terms of T-Mobile, the company has a TTM PE multiple of 88.5 and a forward PE projection of 16.7.In order to make the calculation straightforward, we need to hold ""P"" in the PE multiple constant. Doing that, we can ask ourselves: at what rate do earnings have to grow in order for this to be a 16.7 multiple stock in one year? Currently diluted earnings per share are $.39. They would need to be ($34.56/16.7= $2.07 eps). Moving from $.39 to $2.07 represents a CAGR in earnings of 430.6%. This certainly isn't the worst growth stock we've seen, but even the most ardent bull might call this a bit optimistic, given this company's operational history.Disconnect Between Revenue and Net IncomeWe looked at the last 25 quarters of revenue and net income and performed the task we do on every company: we calculated the correlation between revenue and net income. Over the past 8 1/4 years, it turns out that there's a (slight) negative relationship between revenue and net income (-.102). This means that added revenue has cost the company a (relatively small amount) of net income. Earnings haven't kept pace with revenue growth (understandable, given the discount service on offer by T-Mobile). The problem is that net income is the source of all shareholder wealth. It's the source of dividends, the source of increased book value via retained earnings, and it's what makes a company more valuable. Without retained earnings, you've got an economic sinkhole that can only last so long. When we see situations like this, we're forced to ask ""if increased sales won't improve net income, what will?""Source: GurufocusRisk Embedded in the Capital StructureThe company's debt load has obviously ballooned over the past few years. As of the most recent quarter, long-term debt stood at $16.26 billion and total long-term liabilities (including long term debt) stood at $32.259 billion. That's quite a pile of debt for a company that earned $1.46 billion in operating income and $245 million in comprehensive income (including a loss on an available for sale security) in 2014. It should be noted that the company spent $1.351 billion on interest in 2014. If the weighted average cost of debt for the firm rises by 1%, income would be swamped. Given current interest rates at the moment, it's not farfetched to imagine the cost of debt increasing in future, with obvious consequences to earnings. This is a risk that must be borne in mind by any potential investor.Source: GurufocusConclusionWe believe when the history of this market cycle is written, it will be exemplified by companies like T-Mobile: rewarded for growing sales in the hope that something or other will happen to make profits grow at the same rate as revenue in the future. We should know from even a cursory reading of market history that such optimism, rewarding growth for its own sake, is rarely rewarded. We believe that at some point such a strategy becomes punishing. This punishment is in direct proportion to the ""expensiveness"" of the company you buy. At the moment, T-Mobile is very expensive.T-Mobile compares itself to competitors like Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T) and Sprint (NYSE:S) and against those competitors, it looks quite good. The retail investor, though, is in the fortunate position to be able to compare this potential investment against the myriad other potential investments out there. It is possible to find companies that make decent returns on invested capital and that are not expensively priced. It is possible to find sustainable dividend yields, and therefore, to anchor on this company is overly myopic in our view. Saying to yourself ""well, they're the best in this industry"" is too short sighted in our view. There are many (much better) choices out there, even in this generally overpriced market."
3203976,78125,2015-05-21T16:34:43-04:00,"T-Mobile continues its dominance in adding customers in a tradeoff with ARPU.The plucky cellular company has its eyes set on AT&T and Verizon consumer bases, which will increasingly require diversification of services offered to consumers.Expect for parent Deutsche Telekom to continue to be receptive to acquisition offers, which may start rolling in if the AT&T-DirectTV merger is allowed.","T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) CEO John Legere is the wildcat among the cellular elite. He's known for his brash tweets and aggressive stance as it comes to growing market share in the fiercely competitive cellular market. And while the T-Mobile template to stealing customers away from AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has recently been challenged through aggressive moves by Sprint (NYSE:S), T-Mobile continues to dominate additions of highly valued post-paid customers.And while Legere has made no bones in expressing his desire to continue catching up to industry leaders AT&T and Verizon, it is difficult to believe that T-Mobile's brash attack on post-paid additions can continue indefinitely. Sprint is beginning to put up a fight for value-oriented customers, and AT&T is pressing forward with plans in Mexico as well as a mega-merger with DirecTV (NYSE:DTV). In the midst of this, DISH (NASDAQ:DISH) has aggressively pursued both wireless spectrum and wireless networks.The next fundamental shift to telecomWith the continuing explosion of online entertainment in the form of Hulu, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), iTunes and YouTube, traditional cable and satellite providers have had to contend with an increasingly competitive market share as consumers gradually eschew their tethered and homebound television services in favor of solutions that support mobile transportability. Cable and satellite providers have countered with varying degrees of mobile capability, but the final step is for cellular and entertainment providers to get lock in step in filling this consumer need.In other words, cable and satellite providers specialize in negotiating programming deals with cable and network stations and then bundling those channels into offerings for consumers. Cellular network providers specialize in building out and improving nationwide cellular networks which allow voice and data connectivity from coast to coast. And as the advent of LTE service speeds has clearly provided a pathway to satisfactory online HD video viewing, the time is ripe for satellite/cable and cellular service providers to merge. The continuing move by AT&T and DirecTV is a preliminary indication of this.Yet while T-Mobile Parent Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) has expressed occasional degrees of exasperation with the cash burn that has been required to carry T-Mobile to this point, they have yet to obtain a sales deal that would be acceptable to all parties. Most recently were attempts by Sprint (S) and Iliad (OTCPK:ILIAY) to purchase T-Mobile for $40 and $33 a share, respectively. And while it appears that the Sprint deal had legs, it ultimately died a regulatory death. Although a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint still remains a good match, it seems unlikely that it will occur under the current political administration.So as far as it comes to an M&A in the cellular landscape, the most likely scenarios involve either T-Mobile or Sprint, and an entertainment provider. Given recent history (and the fact that DISH is about to be quite alone in the satellite-only market) the most likely near-term candidate for such a union would be DISH.The PlayersGiven AT&T's increasingly likely merger to DirecTV, Verizon may seem a likely candidate to step up efforts to join in with a cable and network provider. Yet there are some obstacles. Although Verizon has expressed varying degrees of interest in acquiring DISH's wireless spectrum, less than a year ago Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam was quite unambiguous regarding his thoughts on a merger with the satellite provider:And beyond this (and perhaps behind the blanket dismissal by McAdam), DISH CEO Charlie Ergen is known for being an uncompromising negotiator:The vast amount of wireless spectrum that DISH has compiled indicates a clear direction for the satellite provider: wireless service. DISH already offers an online programming standalone in the form of Sling TV. The ability to use this service to lure cellular customers (and to introduce them to DISH's other products) should be appealing and productive.And, of course, DISH needs to keep up with direct rival DirecTV. Added to this is a sense of urgency as FCC rules will require DISH to begin putting their spectrum assets to use within the next dozen or so months. DISH has responded by seeking a chief marketing officer in order to promote wireless service. Still, running out a nationwide network on their own is clearly not feasible. It is difficult to see how DISH's plans can work without consolidation with one of the national cellular network providers.The problemsDISH has been the subject of multiple M&A stories over the years. The latest rumor revolves around T-Mobile, as the willingness of parent Deutsche Telekom to deal its US asset has been made clear in previous year negotiations with both Sprint and French based Iliad. DISH (for their part) has been linked to deals with DirecTV, Verizon, Sprint and Clearwire.And while the satellite provider has been unable to expand its reach into the cellular market via a merger deal, the situation may be changing. DISH is under pressure by use it or lose it rules applied to its vast spectrum asset. AT&T and Verizon do not seem to have a pressing need for the spectrum, and frankly neither do T-Mobile or Sprint. It is difficult to imagine DISH attempting to build out its own nationwide cellular network to swamp an already crowded cellular market.Reports seem to indicate that DISH CEO Ergen's aggressive negotiating tactics have cost the satellite provider opportunities in the past, but now that DISH is up against the wall some of that aggression may be tenderized. And then there is this:DISH and T-MobileRecent conference calls by both DISH and T-Mobile CEO's have been rosy with regard to one another:From T-Mobile CEO Legere on the fourth quarter conference call:In contrast, T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom seems to be approaching DISH CEO Ergen's aggressive negotiating style with positioning on their part:The specter of M&A remains distinct between T-Mobile and DISH, but there are obviously a number of events that could derail the plan including Ergen's aggressive negotiating tactics torpedoing it, a regulatory kink in the AT&T/DirecTV deal, or a countermove by Sprint parent SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY) (likely on Sprint's behalf).T-Mobile and the FundamentalsOn the year T-Mobile has traded up and down. September through November market an overall decline in the cellular equities market as Sprint ramped up competition with margin squeezing promotions. Through this, T-Mobile has rebounded due to their ability to weather the storm and continue to add post-paid customers. The stock is recently through its 52-week high (low and high of $24.26 and $36.81).And while P/E measurements can be sometimes misleading, the trailing twelve months produce an eye popping 89 P/E, with the forward a much more reasonable 19.4. For a company with a strong track record of growth, this is a reasonable forward figure. Actually it is a bargain, save for the tight margins that have developed in the industry overall and the obvious question regarding how long this growth rate can reasonably continue.Profit margin is tight but positive, and one would expect that the hyper-competitive nature of the current cellular landscape will eventually ease allowing for ARPU and profit margins to gradually return to more sustainable levels. That said T-Mobile is nonetheless still trading with a premium. As direct competitor Sprint continues making ground on network improvements, T-Mobile will most likely need to look for new opportunities if they want to find fertile grounds for further growth. The degree to which the current premium on T-Mobile's price is justified will rely on their ability to enhance offerings to consumers and to entice current consumers with additional services.ConclusionT-Mobile is likely in the best position of the remaining national network providers to close a deal with an interested party such as DISH. If the synergies of these types of vertical mergers are indeed positive (as it seems they should be) expect for the AT&T/DirecTV deal to signal the beginning of an overall rebalance in the broad communications business. Investors should watch for moves between DISH and T-Mobile and begin thinking about buying a position if things heat up. Given T-Mobile's relatively better position, T-Mobile is a safer shelter than DISH to wait the news out (while DISH will likely produce better returns once a clear direction is given with regard to their spectrum assets).﻿﻿"
3116976,32711,2015-04-29T13:47:56-04:00,"Over the last few years, T-Mobile US has been shaking up the market with its low-cost approach.This has led to huge subscriber growth, at the expense of the bottom line.With earnings expected to stabilize throughout this fiscal year, the success of T-Mobile's strategy may cause significant changes in the US wireless telecom landscape.","Winds of change are blowing through the US wireless telecom market, led by T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS). Over the last few years, the company has challenged the established way of doing things by offering aggressive promotions and low-cost plans, which has paid off hugely in terms of subscriber growth. In all likelihood, T-Mobile is now the country's third largest carrier. Its latest report showed yet another huge jump in postpaid subscribers, and although the company turned a loss, the bottom line is expected to stabilize this fiscal year.Shaking things upIn a sense, one could see T-Mobile's way of doing things as the application of the European telecom model to the US market, as the company is after all owned by the German Deutsche Telekom. Generally, plans are considerably cheaper in Europe, and many of the extra fees Americans pay are absent in European postpaid plans. The introduction of this 'un-carrier' approach has shaken up an industry that was formerly dominated by the duopoly of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T).In terms of subscriber growth, this has paid off enormously. It has moreover sent a clear signal to consumers, as well as the powers that be, that there is an alternative to the established way of doing things, which has generally put corporate profits ahead of the customer. This has come at a steep price, though, as aggressive promotions and price cuts mean that T-Mobile US has habitually posted a loss over the last few years.By the numbersAlthough revenue and subscriber growth came in ahead of expectations, T-Mobile's quarterly loss was slightly higher than analysts had anticipated. Revenue ticked up 13% to $7.8 billion, handily beating the $7.7 billion mark. For the period, the company turned a loss of $0.09 per share, which was a penny more than analysts were modeling, but considerably better than the $0.19 per share loss the company reported in the same period a year ago.As usual, the star of the show was subscriber growth. For the period, T-Mobile US added some 1.1 million postpaid subscribers, while Verizon and AT&T both saw their subscription rates fall, indicating that consumers are crossing over to T-Mobile's cheaper plans. At the same time, the company raised its full year growth forecast from 2.2-3.2 million to 3-3.5 million. T-Mobile is also doing a better job of retaining these customers, with churn at an all-time low of 1.3%.Aside from pricing, two things should continue to fuel subscriber growth going forward. First of all, the rollout of the 4G LTE network, the fastest in the US, is quickly catching up to the competition. This is significant, as data is quickly becoming the backbone of mobile telecommunications. Secondly, the company is now targeting business customers with its 'Business Un-leashed' launch, which provides the same benefits under its 'un-carrier' model. Although it is as of yet unclear how many businesses will switch over to T-Mobile, it is again a clear challenge to Verizon and AT&T.Adding subscribers is all well and good, but with a very choppy earnings history over the last few years, the question legitimately remains at which point the company will be able to convert this into sustained earnings growth. This may be quite soon, actually.If the company manages to hit analyst EPS targets for 2015, earnings will more than double from fiscal 2014 to $0.81, with free cash flow expected to materialize by the end of the year. Should the low-cost approach start to actually pay off in terms of bottom line growth, we may be seeing a major shift in the US telecom market over the next few years, with T-Mobile emerging as the victor.ConclusionOver the last few years, T-Mobile has been disrupting the US telecom market with a low-cost strategy dubbed the 'un-carrier' approach. This aggressive pricing model, as well as continued investments in its infrastructure, have eaten into the bottom line. For its Q1 report, it posted another loss. However, as the company continues to draw customers from other providers and grow revenue at a rapid pace, the bottom line is expected to stabilize this year, which would validate the company's strategy and in all likelihood cause a major shift in the American wireless telecom market."
3003476,68025,2015-03-17T09:17:55-04:00,"Investing in T-Mobile’s Series A preferred stock presents an interesting event-driven trading opportunity.
        T-Mobile is subject to significant speculation regarding a merger with Dish Network.
        A merger would provide numerous synergies and significantly improve T-Mobile’s competitive positioning in the wireless industry.
        T-Mobile’s common stock is fairly valued today, so speculating on an uncertain merger does not provide an attractive risk-reward opportunity.
        T-Mobile’s Series A preferred stock provides similar upside returns to the common stock with less downside providing a better risk-reward opportunity.","Company HistoryMost people are familiar with T-Mobile US, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TMUS) corporate history, but as a simple refresher, TMUS has been the focus of consolidation in the U.S. wireless industry for several years now, but has been left at the altar several times. T-Mobile was a controlled subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom until 2013 when it went public through a reverse merger with MetroPCS. Deutsche Telekom remains a 66% shareholder today, but has been looking for a way to exit its investment in TMUS since at least 2011. Deutsche Telecom originally attempted to sell T-Mobile to AT&T (NYSE:T) in 2011 for $39 billion, however, the Department of Justice blocked the transaction on antitrust grounds. Additionally, for the majority of 2014, TMUS was the subject of takeover speculation with Sprint (NYSE:S) rumored to be an acquirer for $40 per share and Iliad of France for $34 per share. The Sprint transaction fell apart in late summer when the companies came to the conclusion that the merger would not receive antitrust approval and the Iliad transaction was rejected as being insufficient.Current Competitive LandscapeThe current U.S. wireless landscape is very competitive and is composed of two very large companies, AT&T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). AT&T and Verizon are the large dominant players with significant market share, large nationwide networks, strong balance sheets and significant spectrum assets. Sprint and T-Mobile are smaller players that have various competitive disadvantages compared to T and VZ. T-Mobile has less spectrum and is capital constrained in its network development. Sprint has a stronger portfolio of spectrum than TMUS, but its network has been a trouble spot for several years due to its transition from legacy networks. Sprint received a capital infusion from Softbank of Japan in 2013, so it has a strong parent, but remains capital constrained compared to T and VZ. TMUS is aggressively pursuing market share with its ""Un-carrier"" strategy. During 2014, TMUS added ~4 million branded post-paid customers, which they estimate to be 100% of the post-paid additions in the industry for the year. T-Mobile has been aggressively pricing its plans and does not require customer contracts, which has been an attractive model to gain customers, but has led to Average Revenue per User declines. Sprint is beginning to improve its network and is now offering similarly priced plans and both AT&T and Verizon are beginning to add contract-free plans. This dynamic could lead to increased price pressure in the industry and therefore declining returns on capital for all of the industry participants, which would be compounded for Sprint and T-Mobile since they need to invest in their network and/or spectrum also.In addition to the main four industry participants, Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH), the satellite TV provider, owns a significant amount of wireless spectrum. Dish has been acquiring wireless spectrum through company acquisitions and most recently through the AWS3 auction where it spent $13.3 billion for 702 licenses and 25 Mhz of spectrum. In order to gain FCC approval to use the spectrum for wireless, Dish agreed to provide network coverage for 40% of its service area by 2017 and 70% by 2021. Charles Ergen, Dish's CEO, stated on their most recent conference call that the as soon as the auction closes they will begin having conversations with industry participants to determine how they use their spectrum with the options including acquiring an operator, leasing their spectrum to the operators or selling the spectrum. A fourth option would be to build a network, but given the capital requirements and the competitive nature of the industry with four major operators, that option is unlikely. Additionally, for historical context, Dish attempted to acquire Sprint in 2013, but lost the auction to Softbank.Potential T-Mobile - Dish MergerA simple internet search will provide numerous news articles from the last few months regarding a potential T-Mobile - Dish merger. A combination between the two companies would immediately improve T-Mobile's spectrum capacity and provide Dish with a wireless network and installed base of subscribers. Additionally, the combined company would likely have a much stronger balance sheet than T-Mobile on a standalone basis and would be able to use the legacy Dish TV cash flows to fund wireless growth and other initiatives. Management of both companies have been saying nice things about the other recently, which confirms the strategic merits of a combination. Finally, Dish's CEO recently retired, so a combination that brought on John Legere to run the combined company could be very exciting. However, since T-Mobile has been left at the altar twice and Dish has several options besides a merger with TMUS, investing in T-Mobile's common stock on merger speculation would only make sense if an investment in T-Mobile makes sense on fundamental grounds.T-Mobile is expected to continue taking market share in the next few years and growing sales and EBITDA, but its equity is likely fairly valued today. Over the next few years, there is likely upside in the stock, but I do not think there is significant upside above market returns without a Dish merger. Although I do not see much downside risk to T-Mobile's shares in the near-term, if the market gets more competitive or if T-Mobile does not add subscribers as fast as expected, there could be downside in the stock. I believe that the risk-reward dynamic is fairly balanced in the near-term in the absence of a transaction.T-Mobile Series A Preferred StockT-Mobile issued $870 million of 5.5% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (TMUS-PA) in December 2015. They issued the preferred stock to finance the acquisition of spectrum in the recent AWS3 auction. The preferred stock converts to common stock on December 15, 2017 at a ratio of 1.9342 (if TMUS is below $25.85) to 1.6119 (if TMUS is greater than $31.02). It has a liquidation preference of $50.00 per share and pays a dividend of 5.5% paid quarterly (although the dividend is priced into the preferred at the current TMUS stock price). The current trading price is ~$59.00, which implies a dividend yield of 4.7%. The interesting dynamics of the preferred equity, is that it provides the investor with the same upside economics as the common stock, but offers downside protection if the stock declines from current trading levels due to a conversion ratio that increases at lower prices. Based on this improved risk-return profile, I believe that the Series A preferred stock is a great way to invest / speculate on a potential merger with Dish. As stated above, a merger would be highly synergistic and well received by investors. If a deal is announced in the near-term, I believe that a reasonable merger price would be in the $36 - $38 range, with potential to achieve the rumored $40 price in the Sprint deal. Also, I believe that if a deal is announced, the stock of both T-Mobile and Dish could trade above the merger price after the announcement and the combined company would have significant upside after a merger is consummated.Additionally, in the event of a merger with cash consideration that represents more than 10% of the total transaction consideration (a ""Fundamental Change""), the conversion ratio would be increased based on a schedule in the prospectus if the transaction is completed by December 15, 2016 and the preferred holder would be entitled to a make-whole on the future forgone dividends. The increased ratio improves returns through 2016 and provides a small ""premium"" to the merger price. For example, the exchange ratio before December 2016 provides 1.6589 shares if TMUS is $31.02 compared to 1.6119 without the Fundamental Change. The ""premium"" to the conversion ratio declines as the merger price increases, but at $40 the ratio would be 1.6127 compared to 1.6119 without a Fundamental Change.IRRs for TMUS stock at different potential future share prices and the preferred stock through December 15, 2017 are presented in the graph below. The IRR for the preferred is calculated assuming that a $0.69 dividend is paid quarterly and that the preferred is converted to TMUS shares in December 2017 at the applicable conversion ratio. The common IRR assumes no dividends and a future share price between $25 - $50. The Fundamental Change scenario, assumes the make-whole is paid in December 2016 and the improved conversion ratio. As shown in the graph, the preferred stock has downside protection compared to the common stock and similar upside. However, since the preferred is a mandatory convert, it is still possible to lose money if TMUS drops significantly, but the loss will be less than the common stock. For the preferred, the IRR at $50 per share is ~16% (total return of ~49%), which is roughly equivalent to the common stock. If TMUS declines to $25 (decline of ~22%), the preferred IRR is approximately -2% with a total return of -6%, which is significantly less than the 22% decline in the common stock.ConclusionA T-Mobile - Dish merger is the subject to significant speculation in the media and makes strategic sense. Given the competitive dynamics, the risk-reward dynamic of investing in T-Mobile common equity are not compelling on a stand-alone basis. However, the T-Mobile preferred stock provides a similar upside return if the stock appreciates or if a merger occurs (or both) while limiting downside risk, thus improving the risk-reward dynamic for an attractive event-driven investment."
3053816,85326,2015-04-06T18:30:05-04:00,T-Mobile's innovative Un-Carrier Initiative will help the company gain more market share from Verizon and AT&T.TMUS's future spectrum prospects are strong going forward.Mobile Virtual Network Operators helps TMUS to maximize ROI and increase the number of subscribers.,"By Tomonori Deguchi and Alanna HardingT-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) strong Q4'14 earnings results boost our confidence on TMUS's potential growth in the long term, as the company was the only major U.S. wireless carrier with expanding sequential adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4'14. Considering its innovative service plan, additional spectrum potential, and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), we believe TMUS has more than 15% upside potential.Un-Carrier InitiativeTMUS is truly the innovator in the wireless telecom service market. Since March 2013, the company has found success by becoming extremely customer-focused, offering services to attract Millennials, who, on average, use more data and services. The company's historical Un-Carrier initiatives include Simple Choice (March 2013), JUMP! (July 2013), Get out of Jail Free (January 2014), etc., which all have contributed to TMUS gaining market share significantly. Recently, the company led the movement to eliminate contracts, realizing that young people did not necessarily want to be locked in. TMUS announced changes in Un-Carrier in phases. Data Stash was Un-Carrier Initiative 8.0, for reference. This move was in response to the fact that traditional telecom companies have you buy data, scare you into buying potentially more than you need in order to avoid overages, and then take the data that you didn't use away at the end of the month. The company actively attempts to find what are considered unjust practices of the telecom industry. We believe that future Un-Carrier initiatives will continue to innovate and attract new customers, which is received well by the market. The Data Stash announcement resulted in a 5.89% trade up over a 7-day period. Further innovation will yield greater market share, higher ARPU, and improved stock performance.TMUS is the fastest-growing wireless carrier in the United States, due to the success of the Un-Carrier initiative. During the recent earnings call, senior management has stated that they have found that their customers do not come to TMUS purely for cost-savings - rather, they come to TMUS to receive the premium services and features that it offers. The company continues to win the business of customers as it continually innovates in the market. Even when some of the company's initiatives are adopted by other carriers, TMUS continues to stay ahead of the industry through continual innovation.SpectrumCurrently, TMUS has a mixed spectrum portfolio. The company has the largest mid-band spectrum portfolio in the industry; however, it has a shortage of low-band spectrum, which is considered to the most valuable in the industry. Going forward, TMUS has a variety of ways in which it could increase and strengthen its portfolio.Traditional Auction PurchasesCurrently, the company has $6 billion of cash on the balance sheet that can be used to purchase spectrum in the primary market in the FCC's upcoming 2016 Broadcaster's Incentive Auction. However, the company has other options to improve its spectrum position.Acquisition and Partnership OpportunitiesSome of this potential centers around another acquisition, and partnership opportunities for the company.2 years ago, Sprint (NYSE:S) announced its intention to acquire TMUS, and TMUS traded up 30%. However, SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBF) and S abandoned plans to acquire the company from Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) when it recently regulatory resistance from the FCC. Upon the abandonment of this attempt, TMUS traded down. When the SFTBF acquisition attempt fell through during August 2014 due to headwinds from the FCC, SFTBF owner Masayoshi Son claimed he would make a revised offer for TMUS if the regulatory environment subsided in the future.Additionally, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Cablevision (NYSE:CVC), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and other tech companies and base-band providers are trying to enter the market with the potential of creating more competition. If that happens, the FCC will be more open to the acquisition, because its original reason to disapprove this acquisition was a competition-based concern. In fact, the chairman of FCC, Tom Wheeler, said ""four national wireless providers are good for American consumers,"" and with potential new entrants, the FCC will be more willing to accept an S/TMUS Acquisition. This move would create a strong spectrum portfolio, as S has attractive spectrums covering broad areas.Dish NetworkDISH (NASDAQ:DISH) has a large amount of low-band, high-quality spectrum, and the FCC requires DISH to start using its spectrum within the designated build out frame. Currently, the majority of the company's spectrum is not in use. DISH has been looking for different ways to utilize its valuable spectrum. We believe that the company's options for its spectrum are either sell the spectrum to VZ (which said in February that it is not interested in making any spectrum purchases for a while) or to T (which is currently tied up in a series of large capital outlays to recent spectrum purchases and company acquisitions), lease the spectrum (to VZ and T, but unlikely to the same reason listed above), partner with TMUS or S (S is not as likely, due to the fact that it has a large war chest of spectrum), acquire TMUS, or build out its own network (not likely, due to huge capex investment in an already intensely competitive market). A partnership or acquisition scenario between TMUS and DISH would create a strong spectrum portfolio that could help TMUS become an even stronger competitor in the market.During TMUS's Q4'14 earnings call, this possibility of a spectrum-based partnership was addressed by the CEO and the CTO. The CEO stated that ""we'd be interested in each aspect of it including some sort of a sharing (program with DISH), but obviously if there is a sharing somebody has to create it to be able to be shared, which also is opportunity for us""; additionally, the CTO commented about DISH's spectrum build-out requirements and the fact that TMUS network framework is well suited to integrating such spectrum. Also, during Iliad's TMUS acquisition attempt, DISH expressed interest in partnering/merging/or acquiring TMUS, in an effort to encourage Deutsche Telekom not to take up Iliad's offer. Such an arrangement would greatly improve TMUS's spectrum network, and would allow the company to compete on a more equal playing field with VZ and T. An acquisition attempt by DISH would likely not face regulatory opposition, as it does not currently operate in the same market, and therefore, there would still be at least 4 players in the market. Due to the lack of regulatory headwinds and potential synergies, we feel that there is high chance that Dish acquires TMUS.MVNOIt has been discussed that small carriers aggressively cut prices of service plans, while sacrificing their profit margin. However, our third driver - the growth potential from MVNO revenues - will improve the company's profit margin going forward, as through MVNO deals with Google, Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), and Univision, the company will be able to gain greater returns on assets that it already possesses.Of the three aforementioned MVNO deals, Univision is the only MVNO that has already launched. The Univision MVNO launched in May 2014, and while neither Univision nor TMUS have announced specific customer numbers, in Q3'14, TMUS announced 333 K net customer additions, versus 235 K net additions in Q2'14, leading us to believe that the large difference was driven by the launch of the Univision MVNO. The company services several smaller MVNOs as well.ValuationThe closest competitor is S - and we really cannot compare TMUS with VZ and T, due to totally different business models, strategy, and financial stability. P/E ratio is not a good measure due to these reasons, and also, S has negative P/E ratio - which is highly influenced by companies' capital structures and capital expenditures. Thus, we use the EV/Sales multiple and DCF analysis to value the company. For the EV/Sales multiple, we take the average of T, VZ, and S, which produced 2.3x, or a price target of $48.58. For DCF, we projected free cash flow of next 10 years and used its WACC as a discount rate and 2.5% for the terminal value growth rate, which produced a price target of $31.80. Putting 50% weight on each of valuations, we reached the 12-month price target of $40.19."

        Monster reported a disappointing quarter while Qorvo hit a trifecta during theirs.","Back in December 2014 I decided that I wanted a portfolio strictly for high flying high growth stocks and added Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) as the first stock in the portfolio. Since that time the portfolio has grown as high as 26 positions and is up 5.71% for 2015 compared to the 2.77% gain in the S&P 500. The intention of this portfolio is to be liquid, or for short-term investments.Almost on a weekly basis I've been making moves in this portfolio, either by adding a stock or removing. After breaking out my screens into the different sectors I adjust my search criteria within each sector. First and foremost I look for companies which are midcaps or larger (over $2 billion), have been profitable over the past year, and depending on the sector usually double digit earnings growth rates for the short- and near-term earnings expectations (except for utility stocks). This past week I bought T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). I'd like to give a quick synopsis of it right now and provide an update for the entire portfolio.T-MobileThe stock appears to be fairly on next year's earnings estimates and on earnings growth potential, and has great near- and long-term earnings growth expectations. The company doesn't pay a dividend and the financial efficiency ratios are quite small. The reason I got in the stock was because I felt that with the price wars taking place in the mobile market right now that this might be the company to survive of the ""smaller"" players. The company also recently inked a deal with BlackBerry (BBRY) and will begin selling their phones again shortly and should bode well for both companies.Now it's time for an update on the entire portfolio.Now for some updates on some of the other stocks in the portfolio. Qorvo announced earnings during the week and shot up close to 12% in the pre-market the following day. The company reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings of $1.11 versus estimates of $0.87 on revenue of $634.9 million versus estimates of $623.4 million. The company also guided for higher fiscal first quarter earnings and revenue than analysts were anticipating. The jump in share price was justified thanks to the trifecta.Monster on the other hand didn't have a good day Friday after reporting earnings Thursday afternoon which disappointed investors. The company reported first quarter earnings of $0.62 per share versus an estimated $0.68 on revenue of $626.79 million versus $601.2 million. The stock was punished by 10% on the news.These are definitely high flying stocks with the exception of Dominion , Mark West Energy, American Tower , and Enbridge Energy Partners . All these puppies are definitely geared for growth in my opinion. So far this portfolio is beating the overall market but the key is to keep tabs on all your stocks regularly as well.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

3065186,54942,2015-04-14T05:00:00-04:00,"T-Mobile is one of the few growth stories remaining in the telecom sector as the management team continues to reinvigorate the brand.The Un-carrier program was well-timed with a nearing completion of the company's network upgrades and geographic expansion of its coverage map.A buyout of the company is highly likely, as it is now the only remaining pure-play wireless company of any scale. There have been many rumors about potential suitors.","T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is one of the four largest U.S. wireless providers which together own 80% of the total wireless market. TMUS used to be the smallest of the four, just behind Sprint (NYSE:S) with 15% market share. We think the company is experiencing a paradigm shift within its growth and financial performance that will be bullish on the share price from these levels. We still believe the market is giving T-Mobile its full due, as years of poor performance (and potential turnarounds) have receded. This time does, in fact, feel different under the new leadership of John Legere, who has revitalized the brand and is attempting to disrupt the industry.T-Mobile Reverse Merger Creates A New Company FocusThe company is majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGF), and used to be a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporate parent. This led to mismanagement and distracted strategic focus, leaving the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to the other large U.S. wireless players. But in late 2012, it was announced that the company would merge with MetroPCS in a complex deal involving a reverse merger structure.After it was approved by both boards of directors, the deal, which was structured as a recapitalization of MetroPCS and is technically the surviving company, took on the T-Mobile name. The deal will still have a large shareholder in Deutsche Telekom, but will free up the subsidiary from wholly owned to an independent framework, allowing it to become independently-run. Outspoken CEO John Legere was installed with other new managers to take up the lead of reforming the organization.The new management team quickly tackled the areas of weakness for the firm that had led to it losing significant market share to the competition. Those items included the lack of LTE build-out compared to the peer group, lack of iPhone device availability, improving its coverage map, and simplifying its pricing strategy.The results of such a transformation have been nothing short of amazing. In 2011 and 2012, the company typically saw postpaid churn above 2.4%, high capex spend, and negative yoy EBITDA growth. Meanwhile, as you may expect, it was losing subscribers to the tune of 2-plus million per year.Since the company was rejuvenated with new management who reinvigorated the brand, the results have been starkly different. In 2013, the first year of the strategic shift, subscribers rose by just over 2 million subs, churn dropped to 1.69%, and capex dropped to just $1.1 billion. By 2014, subscriber growth jumped by 4.9 million, churn continued to fall to 1.5%, and EBITDA started growing again. In the meantime, the company surpassed Sprint - when you include MetroPCS and Boost subs - as the number three wireless brand in terms of customer base. By the end of 2014, TMUS had 55 million customers, up from just 33 million in 2012.What's Next For The Brand?The economics of the industry mean that there are large benefits of scale to the wireless business. Spectrum, once obtained, is the only capacity-stricken resource that the companies face. Otherwise, it becomes basic build-out and maintenance of their networks, coupled with the ARPU they can generate on their pricing and plan strategies. Like cable operators or auto manufacturers, the business is based on large, up-front fixed costs that require heavy capital investments. Operating leverage can then be applied to the structure to reap significant profit.Once you finish the build-out of the network, the game is to attract new subs via pricing and marketing. The larger the sub base, the better the margins - simple as that. For example, Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireless business has EBITDA margins that are around 40%. Sprint and T-Mobile, at the start of 2013, were significantly behind in their LTE build-out, which cost them a significant amount of subs to AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon. However, T-Mobile's changes have moved it into the same realm - in terms of technology - as the larger two, with the company now focusing heavily on gaining subs.Meanwhile, Sprint, by way of mismanagement and poor service quality, continues to lose share as the company plays catch-up in building LTE service. As it had financial difficulties for a number of years following the recession, it could not raise the adequate capital in order to finance the LTE network upgrades needed. This put the company behind the technology curve, and given the low switching costs inherent within the business, it lost millions of subscribers. T-Mobile is becoming one of the net beneficiaries of Sprint's pain.Promotional ImpactThe launch of the ""Un-carrier program."" which eliminated the rigid rules, layers of bureaucracy, and long, undecipherable contracts, has been a strategic boon for the company in terms of adding new subscribers. While it has depressed EBITDA margins by 400 bps from 2012 to 2014, it has significantly increased the subscriber base. As we noted above, the game is operating leverage and gaining subscribers to spread the revenue across the large fixed-asset base. This was a natural extension after the completion of their network upgrades - attracting disenfranchised subscribers who disliked the customer service and contracts of AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon.We think the new T-Mobile will have significant leverage opportunities going forward. The company can continue to attract new subs through the reasonably priced phone plans, without locking them into rigid contracts. Consumers have responded extremely positively to the program. Once they ""try"" the network without commitment and experience the company's customer service, they then can feel much better about locking into a longer-term contract.(Source: Company Website)(Source: Company Website)The company's promotional spending on these Un-carrier marketing programs has been high, but they have worked, growing subscribers significantly. TMUS has recently launched new iterations of the Un-carrier program (dubbed 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0). These are new growth initiatives meant to continue to attract subs from the other three market share players.The 5.0 program is the company's test driver program, allowing potential new subs a seven-day test of the service with an iPhone 5s at no cost whatsoever. 6.0 is the launch of a free music service with Simple Choice customers able to now stream all the music that want from the most popular streaming music services without it using any of their data bank. 7.0 is the enabling of Wi-Fi calling, allowing customers to call and text over any Wi-Fi connection. And lastly, 8.0 is the company's Data Stash program, allowing customers to roll their unused data forward to the next month.We believe one of the overhangs that has held back the stock is the market's belief that the company cannot afford to carry on all the termination fees and other Un-carrier program pieces. However, we would counter that with the fact that T-Mobile has been strongly growing its average billing per user (ABPU) over the last two years, which has helped offset those expenses. And we think that the company will see less in the way of termination and other expenses regarding these programs as it winds some of them down - which management hinted may start occurring. Monthly ABPU hit $61.80 in the fourth quarter of 2014, the highest amount in company history - up from $57.28 in Q1 2013.Ramp-Up In 2015 Performance Coming From Subscriber GrowthT-Mobile will likely continue to revolutionize the wireless industry by launching new Un-carrier program iterations, in order to grow post-paid gross subs. We believe the company will continue to add new subscribers between 3 and 4 million in 2015 and 2016. We think this will enable it to substantially ramp up its free cash flow generation and EBITDA as the company leverages its operating base of fixed assets.Looking at industry market research by JD Power on network quality, T-Mobile remains in third place, where it has been for a few years now. Last year, the company had eclipsed AT&T for second place in a few geographic areas, namely the Northeast and the West. However, in a report release in early March 2015, T-Mobile had once again ceded those regions back to AT&T. The company likely had been making headway in those regions, as it had invested in a massive network expansion. But, T-Mobile adding million of new subscribers since then has likely reduced the network quality, and means that it is showing some signs of saturation in areas.Starting this year, the company will attempt to mitigate this by rolling out its newly acquired 700 mhz spectrum (Band-12) deployment for the first time. Management noted that they hope to have this spectrum fully deployed by the end of this year. The band allows signals from cell towers to travel much further, pushing out their coverage maps to cover more people from the same amount of cell towers, while adding capacity. The presentation slide below was pulled from a presentation for a recent Deutsche Telekom Investor Day in Germany.(Source: Deutsche Telekom Investor Presentation)T-Mobile purchased the bulk of the spectrum licenses from Verizon Wireless last year for $2.4 billion. Since then, it has added to its 700 mhz spectrum holdings through a variety of smaller purchases with other companies. The company now covers 60% of the U.S. population and more than 70% of T-Mobile's existing customer base with 700 mhz. As the map above shows, the population covered will increase by approximately 35 million, and coverage will increased by approximately 1 million square miles.(Source: Spectrum Gateway)PC Magazine noted recently that users would see a marked improvement in service quality and data speeds. However, only a few phones have the band enabled within it, and the iPhone is not one of them - although there are rumors that the next iPhone model will include new modems that allow Band-12 service. T-Mobile is aiming to cover 300 million Americans with LTE service by the end of this year, which is what AT&T and Verizon both claim to serve, and have service speeds that rival the larger two players.The new spectrum and subsequent coverage growth will allow T-Mobile to address a portion of the population that it was previously not able to serve. Thus, the company can increase penetration in these areas from a zero starting point and boost incremental EBITDA generation accordingly. Additionally, the better network quality should decrease churn rates, further boosting net subscriber growth. Given Sprint's problems, we think the company will continue to take share away from it, as well as disenchanted AT&T and Verizon customers, continuing to boost sub growth. 2015 is likely to be a pivotal year as it completes their near-term network upgrades, completing the LTE coverage map - which will, by year-end, look very similar to Verizon's or AT&T's. At that point, we think the company will be able to ratchet up its subscriber capacity in the Northeast and perform better on speed and network quality tests.EBITDA and FCF Spike Coming?We believe all of the above is converging to continue to boost subscribers, which will soon boost EBITDA and free cash flow. EBITDA generation typically lags the growth in gross subs, as upfront promotional programs take time to wind through the new subscriber and work through the income statement. But given the subscriber growth last year, with most coming in the highly competitive second half, we think those new subs will start contributing to EBITDA in the second and third quarters of 2015.EBITDA should grow significantly this year to in excess of $7.2 billion from $5.3 billion last year. EBITDA had been stuck around mid-$5 billion for two years as the company invested heavily in its promotional activities and network build-out. The last time T-Mobile saw a strong ramp-up was back in 2012-2013, when the new management team came in and completely restructured its operations. Each time this has occurred, the stock price has responded positively.(Source: Bloomberg)We think another ramp-up in EBITDA is set to start this year and continue for at least two years, possibly longer. Estimates for this year continue to increase on the back of the strong subscriber numbers it continues to put up. We believe the incremental subscriber growth, along with some higher pricing overall on its more recent promotional deals, could allow the company to surprise to the upside. While the market has anticipated this EBITDA ramp-up, we don't think it expects a continued growth trajectory beyond the next two years. Our thesis on that is predicated on a superior customer service profile, while differentiation between LTE service levels declines. Essentially, the business is becoming commoditized, with the true differentiator being customer service and pricing.(Source: Statista.com)The Street is hanging near the mid-point of the company's guidance, with consensus right around $7 billion (company estimates were between $6.8 and $7.2B). However, we believe that the risk is that they exceed the range to the upside, given the strong customer account growth and higher pricing. The latter dynamic is being driven both by the company moving its pricing closer to its main competition, while converting Metro customers (more below).We also think the Street is underestimating the longevity of the potential growth. Both JPMorgan and Credit Suisse see a strong ramp-up to approximately $7, billion but then significantly curtail the growth rate for 2016 and even further for 2017. Given the lower sub churn and underlying momentum to the business due to the attraction of the company's Un-carrier program, we believe the growth (while not as large as 2015) will have staying power, growing EBITDA by double digits through 2018.The next piece that we think is being ignored is the integration of the MetroPCS business, which is well ahead of schedule. The company recently increased the expected synergies from $6-7 billion on an NPV basis, to $9-10 billion. Starting in mid-2013, the company began shifting MetroPCS customers over to T-Mobile's network. By the fourth quarter of 2014, the company had moved 87% of the former MetroPCS customer base. Meanwhile, it has now re-farmed 73% of the MetroPCS spectrum over to T-Mobile.Management also hinted that they expect to hit a synergy run rate of at least $1.5 billion one year earlier, in 2016, versus the original 2017 plan. Another significant factor for EBITDA growth is the much decreased one-time costs for the MetroPCS conversion and integration. These extraordinary costs are now expected to be lower by $750 million to $1.05 billion - a massive sum. We believe some of these savings will be reallocated to additional spectrum purchases in 2015.Lastly, the company has significant NOLs that are likely to shield the firm from a large portion of cash tax expenses through 2017 and likely into 2018.All of the above should combine to generate the first positive free cash flow generation in the company's history this year. We think by the end of 2017, free cash flow should ramp up, running one to two years behind EBITDA, as capex should decline materially as a percentage of revenues, and in absolute terms be flat to slightly down over the next two years. Free cash flow in 2013 was a negative $950 million, but we expect the company to generate free cash flow of $770 million this year and over $2 billion in 2016. An astonishing turnaround in a few short years.T-Mobile Set To Be Acquired?Given the turnaround, the company is likely to be a target for a strategic acquisition, as its assets are highly coveted. While we think Deutsche Telekom will only accept a moderately expensive offer, we think the company will sell to the right bidder who sees strong synergies and cross-selling opportunities. The Sprint and T-Mobile merger talks last year clearly did not pass FCC muster after Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBY) took a stake in the former company.There are many other ""rumors"" flying around about potential suitors. One of the more prominent is Dish Networks (NASDAQ:DISH) buying the company up and adding wireless to a stagnant satellite business. The optionality within such a purchase would snag the spectrum that Dish has leased to Verizon back to its own ownership for T-Mobile's own usage, which would be a boon for T-Mobile, while hurting one of its larger rivals. Dish has a large amount of spectrum assets that it has accumulated over the years. While the company has leased out some of them, a large bank remain dormant and un-utilized.Additionally, Sprint may not 100% be out of the running, even if the U.S. elects another Democratic president in 2016 and a new FCC chairman is put in place. But the question would be if Softbank, whom Sprint merged with in 2013, would still want to pursue the acquisition.Other cable operators could be acquirers of T-Mobile, in order to add synergy and bundle options to customers. We believe Liberty could be a potential buyer as it seeks to further grow its American asset base. A European cable operator could be another possible acquirer in an attempt at American expansion, with Telecom Italia (TI) rumored to be interested.T-Mobile is now a key strategic asset in play, with a growing asset base, key spectrum assets, and a large customer foundation that could be exploited for potential synergy and cross-selling opportunity. We place a high probability on the chances that the company is acquired.There are only minor detriments and impediments towards a potential buyout, including the high debt levels, carrier integration, and synergies from its customer basis. This is why we think the buyer will not be a wireless company, but an adjacent operator who can leverage the company's customer service and accounts management services. An adjacent operator would also likely skip potential FTC regulatory issues, as the wireless carrier space has consolidated significantly in the last decade.ValuationT-Mobile, we feel, trades at an extremely cheap value for the high likelihood that it gets taken out for a nice premium. On a TTM EV/EBITDA basis, the shares trade for just 8.7x and 6.2 NTM EV/EBITDA, given the ramp-up. This is a substantial discount to its peer group median average of 8.4x NTM, especially given the progress we believe the company has made in upgrading the quality of its network and growing both subscribers and EBITDA.This compares favorably to AT&T and Verizon, which trade at 5.9x and 6.8x NTM EV/EBITDA, respectively, but have little sub growth and are saddled with a legacy wireline business, dragging down their results. As a multiple of revenue, the company is trading at 1.4x NTM EV/Rev, compared to 2.3x for both its larger competitors. If we assume that the company, through its continued turnaround and subscriber growth, can achieve a valuation closer to 2.0x, still a discount to VZ/AT&T, the price would be nearly 45% higher. Meanwhile, its competitors would still have the wirelines, which should reduce their valuations.Our price target under a no-buyout scenario is a 6.7x multiple on $8.4 billion EBITDA for fiscal 2016, with a net debt balance of $20.7 billion, which forecasts another $1 billion of spectrum asset acquisitions for 2015. We think the levered free cash flow yield will eclipse 8.1%. At 6.7x, the target price under this valuation methodology would be $44 for the current year-end and nearly $52 for year-end 2016, for upside potential of 33% and 57%, respectively.As we noted above, the Street sees the current ramp as a one-year phenomenon, which is where we would disagree. The current market price is implying a large ramp-up in EBITDA for 2015, with that growth rate falling to mid-single digits for 2016 and low-to-mid single digits for 2017. We think the EBITDA could continue to grow at low-double digits through 2017 due to the factors above, implying a much higher valuation.(Source: Author's Calculation)Given the growth we expect in free cash flow over the next two years, the company is likely to see a strong upside in the shares. The stock is currently trading at less than 10x our 2017 free cash flow per share figure on a taxable basis. This compares to the 17.1x for Verizon and 14.7x for AT&T. One can apply any movement in that multiple that one likes - 12.5x implies a 25% move in the shares - and see the potential in the convergence trade.Lastly, our DCF model also shows a valuation in the low $40s, using fairly consistent growth assumptions expected this year over the next four. The model has an assumed tax rate of 31% going forward, but as we noted above, the company is unlikely to pay much in the way of taxes until at least 2017 and likely later.(Source: Author's Calculation)We do think there is a very strong chance of a buyout occurring within the next two years. The probability of such an occurrence could be as high as fifty-fifty this year alone. We noted above who the potential suitors could be, but whomever it is, we think it will be someone with significant synergy opportunities allowing it to benefit from the combination of the firms. This will allow it to pay up for the company, as the spectrum assets and subscriber base provides strong opportunities for a complementary organization (like Dish Network). We have seen research that notes the spectrum assets, based off of recent auction prices, are worth as much as $35 per share alone.We believe that the buyout potential provides a solid floor in the shares, as any strong dip in the price is likely to lead to an offer from a suitor. Dish Networks is notoriously cheap, and is unlikely to pay a large premium. However, if the shares fall from the current $32-33 area into the mid-to-high $20s, we think Dish could offer between $34 and $38 and would likely be able to secure a deal. Overall, we think there is a strong asymmetric return potential at play here.CatalystsThe catalysts for this year include:ConclusionT-Mobile appears poised to complete its turnaround in fiscal 2015 through the continued upgrade of the company's network reaching the same population as AT&T and Verizon. It has very quietly turned into a wireless powerhouse that is threatening the two entrenched players by gobbling up the much-weaker Sprint subs and offering a completely different business model - one that customers have responded to very favorably. We think there is a still a bit of a performance overhang of their network from three-plus years ago, when the company had one of the weakest build-outs of LTE. However, that has rapidly changed, and the company is quickly approaching par with AT&T in performance speeds, which should help draw more customers. Additionally, the latest Un-carrier promotions, including the test drive offer, are likely to bring additional attention to the company's offering. We think the shares are asymmetrically priced for a strong upside move with a near-term time horizon."
3000176,25218,2015-03-13T14:35:21-04:00,"T-Mobile common stock does not pay a dividend. However, the preferred stock issued at the end of 2014 is currently yielding 4.65%.The preferred stock is highly correlated to the common stock, and further upside will also drive further upside in the value of the preferred.Based on its recent performance, and the potential for a rate hike induced correction, hedging a long position in T-Mobile is worth considering.","In this article, I will be examining a potential long-term trade for investors who are bullish on T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), are looking for income, and want a downside hedge. For investors who are bullish on the wireless industry and looking for income, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are the go-to choices because T-Mobile and Sprint (NYSE:S) do not pay a dividend. However, I was looking at recent issues of income securities on Quantum Online and noticed that T-Mobile had issued 5.50% mandatory convertible preferred stock in November 2014. The date of mandatory conversion is December 15th, 2017, therefore the preferred issue still has just over two and half years remaining before it must be converted to T-Mobile common stock. The preferred stock is attractive because at current levels the dividend yield is 4.65%, which is slightly higher than the 4.63% yield that Verizon has, and is modestly lower than the 5.74% yield that AT&T has.Preferred Stock Conversion DetailsEstimated Preferred Stock ValueTo estimate the fair value for shares of the preferred stock, I constructed the following chart with data that incorporates the conversion rate at various prices and includes the remaining eleven dividend payments. As you can see in the chart, when the price of TMUS common stock [Horizontal Axis] increases above $31, the value of the preferred increases as well, because TMUS common stock is above the upper conversion condition, which is at $31.02. Based on the current price of TMUS common stock, and the remaining preferred dividends, my chart shows that the current fair value estimate of the preferred stock is $59.30/share. The current price of the preferred stock at the time of writing this was $59.18/share, which is slightly below my estimated value.Question: With the preferred stock being close to being fairly valued, one might ask why invest if the preferred is so close to fairly valued?Answer: As the chart below shows, T-Mobile common stock [Blue Line] is highly correlated to the preferred stock [Candles], and thus if T-Mobile common stock continues to increase, the preferred will also increase in value. Since the preferred was issued in late 2014, T-Mobile common stock has increased significantly and thus the preferred has increased significantly in value as well. Therefore, investors who are bullish on T-Mobile can still participate to the upside, and receive a 4.65% dividend.Long-term trade OverviewThe long-term trade would have two parts, a long position in the preferred stock, combined with a January 2017 $30 put on the common stock of T-Mobile to hedge potential downside risk. I constructed two tables below, one showing the combination of preferred stock and a put option trade, and the other showing the common stock and a put option trade.Preferred and Put OptionThe following table shows a hypothetical example of an investor who would purchase 100 shares of preferred stock at $59.18/share, and purchase one $30 January 2017 put option at a cost of $435. I detailed two scenarios below, the first is if TMUS common stock reaches the current price consensus estimate of $36/share, and the other is if the stock falls to $28/share. To estimate how much the put option would be worth at expiration, I used my ThinkorSwim platforms theoretical option value tool to estimate that if the price fell to $28, the put option would be worth $199 at option expiration. The option would be worth more than $199 if the T-Mobile shares fell below the $30 strike price prior to the options expiration. If the price rises to $36, the option would be worth $0 at expiration. The estimated returns for if the common stock price rises would be 3.24% and -6.26% if the price falls.Common and Put OptionThe following table shows a hypothetical example of an investor who would purchase the same dollar amount of common stock as the example above purchased in preferred stock. That equates to 184.30 shares of TMUS common stock at a price of $32.11/share and purchase one $30 January 2017 put option at a cost of $435.When comparing the estimated returns of the preferred and the common under these scenarios, you can see that if you own the preferred and a hedge the difference is only 1.20% [4.44% common -3.24% Preferred=1.20%]. However, in exchange for a slight difference in the upside, the downside risk protection provided by owning the preferred and a put option is significant. Under my scenario, if shares of TMUS were to fall I estimated the return of the preferred trade to return -6.26% and the common trade to return -15.64%, which is a difference of 9.37%. Therefore, based on my estimations, an investor would give up 1.20% of upside in exchange for 9.37% of downside protection.Closing ThoughtsInvestors who are bullish on T-Mobile can participate to the upside with the added kicker of having a stable dividend that currently is yielding 4.65%, and a downside hedge to protect the position if T-Mobile shares fall. T-Mobile has had a great run so far this year, and with the potential of a Federal Reserve rate hike within the next year, there is the possibility that shares of T-Mobile could fall. For those reasons, I believe one option investors looking at T-Mobile should consider is a long position in the preferred stock, and long-term puts to hedge downside risk.Disclaimer: See here."
2943136,22148,2015-02-25T04:30:06-05:00,T-Mobile smashed analyst estimates for Q414.The ability to constrain costs while growing revenue led to higher margins.The wild quarterly swings and questioned ability to hit profit targets make the stock difficult to own at the current lofty P/E multiples.,"After a strong beat on Q414 results, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) had a very muted response. The stock only gained 2.74% on the day and ended up far below the $33.22 high for the day. The muted stock gain seems strange if T-Mobile had truly turned the corner on profits.The large beat is surprising considering the promotional activities in the domestic wireless space. Also, it continues a trend for rather large EPS swings at a business largely reliant on recurring revenue and fixed costs. Has the wireless provider actually turned the corner on profits or is something else going on that causes the company to miss one quarter and beat the next?Improving CostsOddly, T-Mobile spent the majority of the Q4 press release discussing the improving customer additions and revenue growth. While that is no doubt important for any company, the real reason T-Mobile beat analyst estimates was the substantial reduction in costs. The news section of Seeking Alpha covered the customer addition numbers and other meaningful topline related numbers here, but a lot of the discussions failed to address that the $280 million revenue beat wasn't enough alone to smash EPS estimates by $0.07. After all, the biggest concern with all of the domestic wireless providers are the margins from competitive pricing.The adjusted EBITDA margin jumped to 30% due to a major drop in the cost of services to only 23.6%, compared to 26.2% last quarter. T-Mobile suggested that the sequential decrease was due to a reduction in regulatory surcharges and lower backhaul costs with key vendors. Note that the company reduced expenses by $100M while revenue grew. In addition, the SG&A expenses were held in check allowing for the percentage of costs to service revenues to decline sequentially roughly 50 basis points to 39.7%.If one reads through the earnings call, the costs held in check aren't discussed either. Sure, some talk was about MetroPCS synergies kicking in quicker than expected, but nothing about the sustainability of the margins achieved during Q4. The only real guidance regarding costs were additional costs of up to $150 million during Q1 for the Data Stash promotion.Wide Earnings SwingsT-Mobile remains the most bizarre and unpredictable stock in the wireless sector. Despite a heavy dose of recurring revenue and mostly fixed costs, T-Mobile manages the wildest quarterly EPS swings in the business. According to the data below, the company consistently swings back and forth from quarterly profits to losses.Source: Yahoo! Finance analyst estimatesA prime example of how a business typically works is Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) where the quarterly EPS numbers don't fluctuate. The domestic wireless leader saw Q4 earnings dip due to margin pressures, but the other quarters were consistent.Source: Yahoo! Finance analyst estimatesAnalysts have now cut earnings to sequentially decrease to $0.03 due to the company itself guiding to a weak Q1. Analysts haven't adjusted 2015 estimates at $0.82 due to front end costs for customer growth.TakeawayThe Q4 numbers for T-Mobile were impressive in the face of a competitive domestic wireless market. The most concerning part is that T-Mobile had a history in 2014 of wildly exceeding estimates one quarter to only wildly miss them the next quarter. This unpredictability and the guidance for a weak Q1 makes it difficult to step into the stock now. The lack of discussion and assurance that the constrained Q4 costs were repeatable is another concern with Q1 estimates already headed in the wrong direction.Without more details, it doesn't add up that T-Mobile becomes wildly profitable in the face of a wireless pricing war. Also, it doesn't add up why investors would pay 38x current year earnings estimates for a stock with so many questions. The recent rally in T-Mobile should be sold with the trade up to $33 likely the peak in the stock."
2840276,43941,2015-01-22T08:58:59-05:00,TMUS reported strong postpaid net ads in fourth quarter.GOOG decides to enter into MVNO arrangement with TMUS and S.MVNO arrangement will help TMUS increase its future revenues.,"In my last article on T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), I mentioned that TMUS would report solid postpaid net additions in future. I pointed out that the iPhone 6, launch of new handsets, attractive 4G LTE speeds and promotional pricing would be responsible for the solid postpaid momentum in the fourth quarter. The company recently reported the preliminary numbers for the fourth quarter, and added around 1.3 million net postpaid subscribers; out of which, 1 million were phone net additions, which is an encouraging sign, as phone net adds also have voice revenues.There has been encouraging news for the company, as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has now decided to directly sell mobile phone plans to its customers. Obviously, GOOG cannot build its own network in this short period of time, so it has decided to enter into a MVNO arrangement with TMUS and Sprint (NYSE:S). In a MVNO arrangement, the company does not need to own a wireless network, and instead buys bulk access to network services from wireless carriers and then operates the network itself.This news might not help the company add more postpaid customers in the future, but it will help the company drive higher revenues by giving GOOG access to its network. TMUS has 1.5x-to-1.6x of spectrum per subscriber, whereas its competitors Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) have the same number in a range of 1x or less. So this means the company has the capacity to sell some of its network services and maintain its robust network. Furthermore, this could provide the company with much needed funds to participate in future spectrum auctions and expand its 4G LTE framework. Lastly, it will increase competition in the market, and GOOG will set its own packages and prices, which is not welcome news for giants like VZ and T."
2923026,73315,2015-02-17T12:59:09-05:00,"Revenues should continue to see a boom YOY, with EPS hopefully finding their way from the negative realms.Stocks are somewhat unsteady, though have clear potential to rise upwards.If report confirms expectations, TMUS may slowly be making a move for the bigger markets.","T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) does not have the pull in the US telecommunications market to determine the industry on its own. For now, that privilege belongs to giants such as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). But while T-Mobile is a small player in comparison to these giants, TMUS' upcoming pre-market earnings report (coming Thursday of this week) continues be a sign that the smaller company may soon make a play to seize a larger portion of the market.By the numbersAs alluded to above, TMUS is a big fish as long as investors look at the company in relation to other smaller telecom companies. But the boom experienced by the company over the last year may require analysts to change the way the company is viewed. With the company exploding during the course of this past fiscal year, the massive increase in net incomes could signal the true entrance of T-Mobile into the larger market as a viable alternative to AT&T and Verizon.If revenue expectations are met, TMUS already stands to boom 15% year over year, rising to $79.1 million from $68.3 million. Though the fiscal year stands to be a boom of large proportions over last year, it should be remembered that the company has largely beaten expectations for the last several quarters, encouraging similar positive feelings about the future as it looks ahead.Before potential investors get too excited, keep things in perspective; AT&T posts revenues in the billions, with Verizon in a similar position. I am not suggesting TMUS can suddenly viably compete with the major power players in the market. Rather, I am suggesting that T-Mobile's boom of income continues to signal the hopeful attempts of a new major player on the market.EPS are expected to see an increase from last quarter, rising from negative levels to a hopeful $.10 per share. Taken on the whole for the fiscal year, earnings will see a slight increase YOY, though this is largely thanks for the bumper second quarter enjoyed in FY 2014.It is entirely possible that TMUS stock will flirt with new highs, though on the back of a slight miss last quarter, this prediction could be heralded as premature. Then again, though the stock did plummet to just under $25 a share a month ago, it has continued to improve and, adding in a historic trend, should see a bump after the posting of FY results.One word of caution, the stock itself is nearing a deleteriously high RSI in the region of 70. Though this may not be significant in the long run, potential investors should keep an eye for the stock to become overweight in the near future.The Bottom LineT-Mobile does and will not have the heft and weight of far larger telecommunications competitors, but there is undeniable growth in the company that is yet to be tapped by leadership. Though stocks are more or less recovering in the wake of the minor earnings slip of Q3, it may be a good time to invest in the company before the company reports before the open of the market Thursday."
2941616,32711,2015-02-23T15:12:41-05:00,"The US wireless telecom industry has been locked in a price war for the last few years.As the instigator, T-Mobile US has managed to significantly increase its market share.Although some worried about the company's ability to monetize on this growth, Q4 earnings showed the company is making strides towards sustainable profit growth.","The US wireless telecom market is a tough one to operate in. With four large carriers each battling it out in terms of service, pricing and marketing, gaining significant market share is a difficult undertaking. After a somewhat uninspiring run of quarterly reports, T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) pricing strategy seems to be paying off, as the company showed solid growth which beat on both the top and bottom line. How did T-Mobile manage to pinch market share from its major competitors?Pricing warSince 2013, the major US carriers have been locked in a protracted price war largely initiated by T-Mobile US. The Deutsche-Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY)-owned wireless carrier started making waves after dubbing itself a ""non-carrier"" and doing away with things such as annual contract fees, subsidized phones, overage charges and early contract termination fees. Many industry watchers initially scoffed at the idea, saying this strategy would gobble up the company's margins.The other major carriers, AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Sprint (NYSE:S) were forced to react with price cuts of their own. According to industry experts, Sprint has been the hardest hit as it is still hemorrhaging customers despite price cuts. Earlier this month, industry heavyweight Verizon announced cuts on many of its More Everything shared plans, suggesting that it is less concerned with higher-end competition and more willing to take on Sprint and T-Mobile on their own turf. All in all, T-Mobile seems to be benefiting most from the price war so far.The spoilsBasically, the company's Q4 and full year figures were a very pleasant surprise to analysts and investors alike. EPS of $0.12 reversed last year's $0.03 loss and blew away the $0.05 analyst consensus. Adjusted EBITDA soared a whopping 41.3% to $1.8 billion on a 19.4% increase in revenue.Clearly, the company's focus on growing its customer base is paying off, especially in terms of mobile phone users. For the period, TM added a net 1.04 million in customers, compared to Verizon's gain of 600,000 and AT&T's loss of around 100,000. Overall, the company gained some 2.1 million customers to put the total at just over 55 million, while Sprint has just under 56 million. It's likely that T-Mobile will close the gap fairly soon.In terms of outlook, things also look fairly rosy, although the projections came in slightly below the analyst consensus. T-Mobile expects to gain between 2.2 million and 3.2 million in postpaid subscribers, down from 4.9 million this year. CFO Braxton Carter was quick to point out however that this guidance was conservative, and that expectations were high going into 2015. For the full year, the company expects to make between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion, with a $7 billion midpoint just shy of the $7.2 billion mark.Although the company is doing a fantastic job of growing its customer base, especially compared to the duopoly of AT&T and Verizon, it still has some work to do in terms of increasing profitability. Yet, the Q4 and full year figures were extremely encouraging, and it looks like the company is capable of resolutely executing its current growth strategies.The bottom lineIn the price war currently being waged by the four major US carriers, T-Mobile US seems to be emerging as the victor. The company's focus on undercutting the competition by doing away with things such as contract fees and cancellation charges has increased its customer base significantly, and the Q4 report has shown that this is, perhaps most importantly, translating into bottom line growth. Although customer growth is expected to slow down over 2015, the company is guiding towards significantly higher adjusted EBITDA for the year."
2993506,24663,2015-03-12T18:17:40-04:00,"ALU's partnership with TMUS will give the latter a better and more reliable network.ALU is a pioneer at utilizing WiFi plus 4G, a move that TMUS will use to its advantage.The outcome is that TMUS can improve its network without sacrificing the many billions it would cost to close the gap with spectrum and network investments.","T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) may be the ""uncarrier,"" and CEO John Legere may be the most outspoken executive in the wireless space, but one thing that Legere can't claim is that the uncarrier is up to par in data performance with its competitors. According to RootMetrics' most recent analysis, T-Mobile's network speed and reliability and its data performance significantly lags that of leaders Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). Thankfully, for T-Mobile investors who expect another banner year, Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) is helping it close the gap.T-Mobile just doesn't have the resources of its larger competitors. There's nothing wrong with that statement - it's just that it is smaller and can't drop $10-20 billion at the drop of a hat to improve its network. The company has to be more calculated in how it improves its network. That said, T-Mobile still has a ways to go.While the gap in each of the three categories is large and would undoubtedly cost many billions of dollars to close, Alcatel-Lucent's technology will help. T-Mobile has partnered with Alcatel-Lucent to deploy Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) in the 5 GHz spectrum. These airwaves are shared with WiFi, meaning that Alcatel-Lucent's small cells will help T-Mobile make WiFi and 4G work together more closely.As explained in a recent article, Alcatel-Lucent is being recognized as a pioneer in combining WiFi and 4G as one network, with a slew of technologies aimed at certain services like voice-over-LTE. Apparently, another one of those technologies is to blur the lines of where WiFi ends and 4G begins. For carriers like T-Mobile, who have spotty 4G coverage and limited resources, this technology is a big deal.Once fully implemented and that 5 GHz spectrum is put to work, WiFi will have far superior range for devices, while both upstream and downstream speeds will significantly increase. It'll also play an important role in dense networks with high traffic, those that often run slow due to the limited spectrum that's available. In those dense areas, WiFi will take some of the strain off 4G, thereby allowing it to work better and faster; this should improve T-Mobile's network scores.All things considered, T-Mobile has completely changed its image, and has industry-low prices and best-in-class service plans. The only problem is its network lags the two dominant U.S. wireless service providers. While T-Mobile's initiative with Alcatel-Lucent won't completely close this gap, it will help, and will give John Legere yet one more thing to sell consumers. In retrospect, lower strain on its network and more strain on free WiFi might even allow T-Mobile to cut plan prices further, implying this deal with Alcatel-Lucent could be very lucrative in the long term."
2763545,73765,2014-12-18T15:44:28-05:00,"T-Mobile looks to boost ARPU with Data Stash's minimum 3GB+ requirement and looks to upsell entry level users higher to attain the value features.With only a 1GB threshold tablet plan minimum, Data Stash can complement tablet promotions to drive 2015 tablet net additions.With the new crop of new prime customers switching to T-Mobile for value, Data Stash is another value feature that can be used for subscriber retention.","What is it?T-Mobile's (NYSE: TMUS) Un-carrier 8.0 Data Stash announcement is essentially the concept of data rollover. Unused data is rolled into the following month but after a year some of the unused data expires annually. To kick off this move beginning on January 1, 2015, the company is providing a starter 10GB of data for subscribers of plans with greater than 3GB or mobile broadband plans/tablets of 1 GB or greater.The notion is not new as it is structurally the same approach as Cingular Wireless'/AT&T's (NYSE:T) Rollover minutes introduced circa 2002. Closely-held regional carrier C Spire reworked the rollover concept with data and launched at the end of November. The motivation was a means of differentiation and value against the national carriers.AnalysisPros:Points of concern:Competitive Impact:"
2730795,43941,2014-12-04T10:50:59-05:00,"Company has done well in competitive environment and has managed to build solid subscriber momentum in the third quarter.Growth expected to continue in future due its competitive pricing and industry-best 4G LTE speeds.ARPU to be pressurized in the future due to aggressive pricing, which limits management’s ability to expand margins.","I continue to remain bullish on T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) due to its solid subscriber growth and the continuous improvement in its network experience. I expect the company to continue delivering solid postpaid net additions in the fourth quarter, and TMUS will eventually beat its own guidance for postpaid net ads. ARPU has stabilized in the last quarter, but I expect it to remain pressurized due to the promotional pricing necessary to survive in the competitive environment. TMUS trades at premium valuations, which justifies its solid growth, but it is slightly overvalued.Better Postpaid Mix The company reported postpaid net adds of 1.4 million in the third quarter. The number is the second largest postpaid net additions among the top four wireless carriers, but I believe TMUS has the best postpaid mix as it recorded the highest postpaid phone net additions of 1.2 million in the third quarter. Its peers AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are the top two largest wireless carriers in the country. Both these incumbents have reported more tablets than phone postpaid net additions, as shown in the table below. The phone net additions are more valuable for companies because tablets do not have voice revenues. So the large postpaid phone net addition has helped the company stabilize its average revenue per unit in 3Q'14.Strong Net Postpaid Ads to Continue in Fourth Quarter Due to the strong performance in the third quarter, the company has raised its guidance for net postpaid ads to be 4.3-4.7 million for the current year. In the first nine months, TMUS added around 3.6 million net additions, which implies the company is expecting net ads to be 0.7-1.1 million in the fourth quarter. I believe the company has been modest in terms of its expectations and its actual net additions will beat management's expectations. The iPhone 6 was the biggest launch the company had, especially after TMUS became the first partner to launch VoLTE and WiFi calling. But the iPhone was available for a few days in the third quarter, which means the company's postpaid numbers will benefit in the fourth quarter as well. Management also pointed out in the earnings call that there are eight new handsets coming in the fourth quarter. Lastly, the company's attractive pricing and superior network quality continues to remain the major attraction for subscribers.Promotional Pricing to take toll on ARPU in FutureManagement expects ARPU to slightly decline in the last quarter due to promotional pricing and regulatory surcharges. However, it believes the trend will reverse in 2015 and sequential improvement will be seen. I believe the company's ARPU will continue to be pressurized due to its aggressive promotional pricing, which is important for the company to survive in the competitive environment. The competitive pressure will further intensify as Sprint (NYSE:S) has already reduced its prices and is working to improve its network experience by leveraging its 2.5GHz spectrum. The porting ratio against S has worsened in October and reached 2.5-to-1 instead of 3.5-to-1 and 3.6-to-1 in 2Q and 3Q, respectively.Network ExperienceThe company already has expanded its 4G LTE service to 250 million PoPs and reached its annual target in the third quarter. So TMUS will now expect to cover 260 million PoPs by the end of this year and 300 million PoPs by the end of next year. In addition to this, the company is also strengthening its 4G LTE network. First, TMUS is rolling out 10x10MHz and 15x15MHz in the top markets of the country. Secondly, the company is integrating low bandwidth A block 700MHz spectrum to its 4G LTE spectrum. Low bandwidth spectrum is superior because it covers large distances and has a high ability to penetrate walls and buildings. It also will help reduce congestion in top markets.The company has been successfully able to leverage its strong spectrum position to give subscribers superior network ability. The figure below highlights average 4G LTE speeds in the third quarter, in which TMUS has a clear advantage. The company's spectrum holdinsg per subscriber is 1.5x to 1.6x, which is significantly better than its peers VZ and T, with 1x or less. This means the company has the potential to increase its subscriber base and still managed to maintain a robust network and deliver solid speeds. The company has submitted an application to participate in the AWS-3 Spectrum auction and is set to participate in the Broadcast auction, which will help further strengthen its network capabilities.Source: Company's Fact BookValuationTo calculate the price target, I have used two methods. In the first case I have used the multiple of EV to EBITDA ratio to calculate the enterprise value and then adjust the value with the total debt and number of shares. In the second method, I have used the discounted free cash flow to determine the target price. My price target is the average of the two methods and it comes out to be $28.63. Currently, the company is trading at $29.24, which shows that the stock is slightly overvalued.Discounted Free Cash flow Analysis I have discounted the free cash flow using the WACC of 6.5%. The terminal growth rate to calculate the terminal value is 1%. Furthermore, the figures for total debt and number for shares outstanding have been taken from Yahoo Finance.Total Value to firm = $293+$721+$1,535+$2,329+$42,765=$47,643 millionTotal Debt= $25,560 millionTotal Value to firm - Total Debt = Total Equity value$47,643 - $25,560= $22,083 millionShare Outstanding = 804.2 millionTarget Price = Total Equity Value/Share Outstanding$27.46 = $22,083/804.2Enterprise to EBITDA MultipleThe company's EV to EBITDA ratio is at 8.83x, which is significantly higher than the average of its peer companies, as shown in the table below. I have used an EV/EBITDA multiple of 8x and EBITDA estimate of $6.2 billion for 2015 to calculate the price target for the company. I believe the ratio of 8.1x is justified given the solid subscriber growth and the network improvement experienced in the recent past by the company. The firm's value comes out to be $48.60 billion and the equity value comes out to be $24.04 billion after adjusting for total debt of $25.56 billion. Divided by the number of outstanding shares at the end of the third quarter, the price target is $29.80 per share.Source: Yahoo FinanceFinal WordsThe company has done well in the competitive environment and has managed to build solid subscriber momentum in the third quarter. The growth is expected to continue in the future as well due to its competitive pricing and the industry-best 4G LTE speeds. TMUS is able to expand its 4G LTE service to 250 million PoPs in just 1.5 years and management is expecting to take it to 300 million PoPS by the end of next year. However, I expect ARPU to be pressurized in the future due to the aggressive pricing."
2816095,80285,2015-01-13T05:53:36-05:00,TMUS shares have rallied strongly since hitting lows in December.Fundamental weaknesses in its balance sheet and financials are overlooked.Flaws of TMUS's aggressive strategy and 'Uncarrier' model are not given enough attention.Expectation of increased profitability due to glut of new subscribers is exaggerated.,"Last week, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) released its 2014 Q3 Pro Forma Combined Results, causing shares to immediately jump and sustain a rise through the week. There is strong basis to reject this rally as a short-term move as the company has fundamental weaknesses that are overlooked in the midst of hype and new subscriber numbers.A quick examination of TMUS's balance sheet and financials reveal a less-than-flattering image. With a debt of 25.56B that exceeds its current market cap of 23B, the excel sheet I've compiled below shows the total annual interest liability due to its debt.(Source: TMUS Annual Report 2013)The long-term debt creates considerable drag on its returns, and it is inconceivable that TMUS would be able to pay dividends of any sort in the foreseeable future. Moreover, compared to its bigger peers AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), TMUS has a significantly lower interest coverage ratio at 4.53, compared to Verizon's 7.37 and AT&T's 7.48. Comparatively, TMUS is struggling to make its interest payments.Also, another glaring issue in the way TMUS operates is the significant stock dilution that shareholders have endured, and can continue to expect. In Nov 2013 TMUS announced a stock offering of 66.15million shares and 6.6million extra shares for underwriters. At the time, total shares outstanding were 728.7M, and subsequently rose to 801.88M by December 2013, representing a dilution (loss in value/share) of 10.04%. Comparatively, before Verizon's buyout of Verizon Wireless, its shares outstanding remained practically the same for the past decade. Similarly, AT&T's shares outstanding have fallen slightly in the past decade, generating more returns for shareholders.In addition, in Dec 2014, there was a public offering of 17,391,305 convertible preferred stock at 5.50%, sold at $50/share. Underwriters were given the option to purchase 2,608,695 additional convertible preferred stock. The annual payments on these shares that TMUS would have to meet come up to $47.83 million. For a company that reported a loss in the $97.89 million in the last quarter, this presents an additional drag on its cash flows. Furthermore, these convertible shares auto-convert to common shares on Dec 15, 2017, at a rate between 1.6119 to 1.9342 shares per convertible share. This would of course mean more dilution. This established pattern of share dilution does not bode well for shareholders.Granted, TMUS needs to raise capital to bid for the FCC's latest spectrum auction and to upgrade its network (which incidentally is the main reason consumers switch to other providers), consider that both Verizon and AT&T are able to bid aggressively for spectrum without incurring significant additional debt or diluting shareholder's equity. Compared to its two bigger peers, TMUS offers less value for its shareholders due to its need to raise capital by consistently diluting shares.Moving on to the reason for the TMUS rally, it recently reported growth in new subscriber numbers which seem encouraging, but are not meaningful enough to justify the rally. Firstly, although TMUS has managed to gain a glut of new subscribers, its 'no-contract' model means that TMUS's ability to retain consumer dollars during an economic downturn is greatly diminished. When incomes fall, subscribers would simply opt for less expensive data plans, reducing overall revenue. Furthermore, TMUS's aggressive pricing strategy is unsustainable in the long-term. Currently, though they are winning record numbers of subscribers, their profit margin from the latest 12-months is a paltry 0.45%. The prevailing assumption is that new subscribers will lead to increased profitability. This is likely false. In order to turn a meaningful profit, TMUS would need to raise prices sometime in the future to increase its profit margins to sustainable levels, potentially losing subscribers that were originally attracted by its low prices.It is also worth considering that TMUS ranks significantly below AT&T and Verizon in terms of overall performance of wireless networks, and ranks dead last in terms of consumer experience, lagging some distance behind Sprint and miles behind the big two. It is also the least reliable network among its peers.(Source: Rootmetrics)(Source: Rootmetrics)EDIT: Readers have raised concerns that the data presented here, taken from the 1h2014 Rootscore reports, is 'outdated'. While there have been several results on Metro areas from the 2h2014 Rootscore reports, it would be inaccurate and misleading to utilize them at this point in time. Simply, TMUS had previously performed well in Metro areas, but very poorly outside them. As such, there was a huge disparity in terms of their network coverage in Metro areas compared to the results at the State and National level. As of the edit, no statistics on the State level have been published by Rootmetrics. Hence, the incomplete data set for 2h2014 would not allow for meaningful analysis.Considering its financial troubles and non-existent profits, it's hard to see how TMUS could increase capital expenditures to drastically increase its network coverage and performance to compete with Verizon and AT&T. More stock offerings, perhaps?For now, optimism about TMUS is gaining due to new subscriber numbers, but the company has numerous fundamental weaknesses that do not justify the optimism reflected in its stock price. Investors need to beware of these adverse long-term factors and assumptions. Caveat Emptor.A more detailed article on TMUS, VZ and T will be uploaded at a later time."

2807305,22148,2015-01-09T14:24:13-05:00,T-Mobile released solid Q4 customer additions.The stock remains a Sell.The data released by T-Mobile doesn't change the ongoing investment thesis that the stock must be avoided until aggressive pricing stops hitting earnings.,"T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) ended the year with solid subscriber additions in Q4, but the key unknown is how much the aggressive pricing to add customers will impact the bottom line. Combined with a strong market, investors have pushed the stock up around 7.5% in the two trading days following the release of the subscriber gains. The stock is currently trading around $29 mid-day and approaching the levels prior to the end of the bidding by Iliad (OTC:ILIAF) and the start of aggressive pricing by Sprint (NYSE:S).For Q4, T-Mobile impressively added 2.1 million net customer additions. More importantly, the company added 1.3 million branded postpaid customer additions, of which 1.0 million were phone customers. The total customer additions for 2014 were 8.3 million and 4.9 million postpaid net customers additions. T-Mobile now has 55.0 million total customers and 27.1 million branded postpaid customers. Growth in both categories was around 20% for the year. Most of the quarterly numbers were higher than last Q4, but generally saw a decline from the prior quarter. In fact, total customer net additions were lower than both Q1 and Q3 this year. T-Mobile continues to suggest that it is taking share from the other national carriers.While the subscriber growth is noteworthy, T-Mobile doesn't provide the all crucial margins. The ongoing investment thesis last highlighted in the article ""T-Mobile: Best Quarter Ever Except The Bottom Line"" is the unfortunate theme to follow. AT&T (NYSE:T) is increasingly matching the promotional efforts of T-Mobile with the recent decision to start allowing some customers to roll over unused data. The end result is a continuation of the domestic pricing war to the bottom. Until T-Mobile can add customers without aggressive pricing, the stock should be avoided."
2630025,22148,2014-11-04T06:02:03-05:00,"T-Mobile continues making impressive progress in growing the customer base.The lack of focus on the bottom line is a red flag to investors.As long as the 2015 EPS trend is down, investors must avoid the stock.","The Q3'14 for T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) was one of the biggest ever in several categories for customers additions, but the mobile carrier noticeably didn't spend a lot of time discussing the bottom line. In fact, the three page press release that discussed the results didn't even mention the bottom line.For a company with a $24 billion market cap and an enterprise value over $40 billion, one has to question the investment thesis that doesn't optimize the bottom line. No doubt, T-Mobile is making great progress in adding postpaid customers. Previous articles on T-Mobile have warned about the focus on customer additions and not profits, especially in a situation where the wireless provider remains a distant thought to the dominant carriers.The Good - Customer AdditionsThe first line of the earnings release says it all regarding customer additions: best quarter ever of branded postpaid net adds - 1.4 million. In general, all of the customer numbers are impressive, especially considering where T-Mobile was at this point about a year ago. Net branded postpaid phone additions were an impressive 1.2 million and broadband net additions were 200,000. The numbers added to the impressive additions of the last year.Source: T-Mobile Q314 FactbookT-Mobile saw solid additions in Wholesale and prepaid customers leading to a total 2.3 million net adds for the quarter. This number wasn't the highest this year with Q1 numbers slightly higher due to the Wholesale and prepaid side, but it continues a strong trend for T-Mobile.Source: T-Mobile Q3'14 FactbookThis string of quarterly customer additions is helping T-Mobile lead the industry in service revenue growth. In the latest quarter, growth accelerated to over 10% and far exceeds the industry. Both AT&T (NYSE:T) and Sprint (NYSE:S) are trending negative and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is the only other domestic wireless carrier still producing YoY service revenue growth. The trend though could turn ugly for the group with the pricing pressure implemented by Sprint towards the end of Q3 and into Q4.The Bad - Bottom LineT-Mobile spent limited time discussing the bottom line and that's a huge red flag. For Q3'14, the wireless provider generated a loss of $0.12, compared to estimates for a $0.02 profit. Adjusted EBITDA declined to $1.35 billion, down 7.2% sequentially from and impressive $1.45 billion in Q2. The number was virtually flat with last year.The reason for the disappointing numbers were the sharp rise in operating expenses both over the previous quarter and last year. While revenue rose roughly $670 million YoY, operating expenses surged around $900 million. While possibly not the end of the world if it helps add customers to make the wireless provider relevant, but it doesn't do a lot to dent the financial dominance by AT&T and Verizon.The loss if anything just weakens T-Mobile more. Neither of those strong providers are seeing a great impact to EPS estimates like the numbers below for T-Mobile.TMUS EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YChartsAccording to the above chart (ignore the two inaccurate spikes), the T-Mobile EPS trend for 2015 has declined substantially in the last six months. While AT&T has seen a decline, the percentage change is substantially less at around 6% of the original estimate than the big decline for T-Mobile.TakeawayBased on the above numbers, T-Mobile appears the worse off from the ongoing wireless wars. The stock isn't investable with the earnings numbers in continual collapse mode. It just doesn't matter how many customers they add, if a year out the impact hits the bottom line that greatly. Until T-Mobile figures out how to take market share profitably, it isn't going to reward shareholders. Sure adding customers makes the company more relevant, but the stock isn't going to benefit. Investors should cash in on the recent rally."
2634355,39231,2014-11-04T04:28:28-05:00,Healthy growth in postpaid subscriber base due to luring subscribers with attractive pricing offers and Un-carrier strategies.Company has favorable growth prospects lined up to grow subscriber base and fuel top-line numbers.TMUS all geared up to expand margins and add towards growth of bottom-line numbers.,"I reiterate my bullish stance on T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS); the company's financial results for 3Q14 remain healthy, driven by its ongoing efforts to compete effectively in the highly competitive North American Telecom sector. As TMUS has been successful in attracting customers towards its Simple Choice Plan and Un-Carrier strategies, its postpaid subscriber additions have been outpacing peers at a decent rate. Furthermore, the company is successfully translating the subscriber momentum into revenue growth. Also, it has been successful in moderating the ARPU losses. Moreover, as LTE networks build out and MetroPcs integration plans remain on track, TMUS is highly likely to report a further improvement in its top-line and bottom-line results in the future.Subscriber Momentum Remains StrongAlthough the competitive environment in the U.S. Telecom Industry is getting intense, TMUS' attractive pricing offers under its Simple Choice Plan and ongoing up-gradation of Un-carrier strategies have been doing well to grow its subscriber base and service revenues. During 3Q14, the company increased data allowances on its Simple Choice plan by giving its customers the flexibility to enjoy unlimited data with its 4 for $100 offer (unlimited data for four lines at $100/month). It is due to such offers on its Simple Choice Plan that by the end of 3Q14, 84% of TMUS' customers have shifted to the plan. Moreover, the company is hopeful to report an almost 90% customer shift to this line-usage plan in the next quarter.Moreover, on the Un-carrier side, the recently launched Un-carrier-6 Wi-Fi unleashed strategy was one of the key drivers of TMUS' healthy postpaid subscriber base during 3Q14. Also, with this strategy, the company became the first U.S. carrier to offer Wi-Fi calling across all its new smartphones. Besides, the recently launched iPhone 6, which supports TMUS's VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling feature, was another plus for the growth of its subscriber base. Although the company reported only 1-full month of iPhone 6 sales, the results are coming very strong with TMUS taking in almost 2.5 million customers of Sprint (NYSE:S). TMUS ended 3Q14 with an addition of 1.4 million postpaid subscribers, growing the company's branded postpaid subscriber base by 20.9% year-over-year, well ahead of its peers. The following chart shows that TMUS' postpaid subscriber base growth (in %), has outpaced AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ).Source: Companies' Quarterly Earnings DataI believe the company's subscriber momentum will remain healthy in the future due to the attractive Simple Choice Plan offers. Also, TMUS' commitment towards the up-gradation of Un-carrier strategies will keep its subscriber base healthy. The TMUS CFO's comments in the recent quarter earnings conference call highlights that another Un-carrier strategy will soon be introduced. John Legere said:Moreover, the company's confidence in the growth of its subscriber base has enhanced; TMUS recently uplifted its outlook on full year 2014 postpaid additions from the previous estimate of 3-3.5 million to 4.3-4.7 million.Subscriber Momentum Translated To Revenue GainsTMUS has been successful in using its healthy subscriber base growth to grow its top-line numbers. For the recently ended 3Q14, due to healthy postpaid subscriber gains, the company's total revenue grew 10% year-over-year, and the service revenue growth was 10.6% year-over-year during the quarter. As far as TMUS' ARPU growth is concerned, pricing offers have been a burden on the company's ARPU. However, the company is making efforts through a better service network to strengthen its ARPU numbers; TMUS reported ARPU of $49.84 for 3Q14, down only by 6.6% as compared to a 9.6% ARPU decline year-over-year in 2Q14. TMUS expects the ARPU to improve more in 4Q14; the company is expecting the sequential 4Q14 ARPU decline to be around 2.5%. Moreover, the company has highlighted about taking disciplined pricing measures in coming quarters, which will help in growing the company's ARPU and will also add to top-line numbers. The following table shows the growth trends of TMUS' Service Revenue and ARPU.Source: Company's Quarterly Earnings DataHealthy Margins GrowthAs far as the company's margins are concerned, its healthy top-line has been supporting its EBITDA margin growth. Moreover, the EIP plan penetration being in its last stages, is also offering healthy margin growth opportunities.Moreover, the company is aggressively expanding and undertaking MetroPCS network integration, to accelerate the transfer of MetroPCS customers to its network. As the MetroPCS integration is expected to be complete soon, the company's prepaid business will add towards the growth of its top-line numbers. Also, the expected synergies from the network integration will grow the company's EBITDA margin. The following chart shows the gradual growth in the MetroPCS customer base that is shifting to TMUS' network.Source: Company's Quarterly Earnings PresentationMoreover, the company's 4G-LTE network build out remains ahead of its plan. The network is able to cover around 250 million POPs. As the company remains committed to expanding its LTE network by actively deploying its 700MHZ spectrum, TMUS' enhanced LTE network will reach 300 million POPs by the end of 2015. I believe this rapidly growing LTE network of the company will portend well for expanding its market share and strengthen its subscriber base, which will grow its revenues and will also improve its margins. The following chart shows TMUS' LTE network coverage plan.Source: Company's Quarterly Earnings PresentationConclusionThe healthy growth in the company's postpaid subscriber base is due to its ability to attract subscribers with attractive pricing offers and Un-carrier strategies. Also, it has favorable growth prospects lined up to grow its subscriber base and fuel its top-line numbers in the quarters ahead. Moreover, the company is all geared up to expand its margins, which will add towards the growth of its bottom-line numbers. Due to the aforementioned factors, I am bullish on TMUS."
2604865,80135,2014-10-29T11:45:54-04:00,"T-Mobile added 2.3 million postpaid customers surpassing AT&T’s and Verizon’s net additions for the third quarter. Revenue was almost in-line but the company missed EPS estimate, thanks to the aggressive pricing strategy.I maintain the $39 price target amid continuing subscriber momentum.The previous piece clearly mentioned that T-Mobile will continue to add subscribers amid un-carrier incentives. However, any strategy to improve ARPU can hurt subscriber growth during the next year.","Momentum is, once again, with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). The company added 1.4 million branded postpaid customers in the third quarter of 2014, more than doubling the net postpaid additions in the same quarter last year. Total net customer additions came around 2.3 million leaving the industry giants behind. AT&T (NYSE:T) added 2 million while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) added 1.54 million customers in the same quarter. T-Mobile closed the quarter with around 52.9 million customers, of which 10 million were added in the last six quarters. Consequently, the services revenue, $5.7 billion, was up 10.6% on a year over year basis. The company posted total revenue of $7.35 billion, almost in line with analysts' consensus of $7.42 billion. In contrast, the EPS was negative while the Wall Street was expecting an EPS of around $0.02. The loss was around $0.12 as compared to $0.05 year-over-year. The company's projections are rather rosy as it is guiding for 4.3 million-4.7 million net additions as compared to the previous guidance of 3 million-3.5 million. The company is also reiterating its profit view for the full year of 2014.Aggressive marketing and discounted rates are resonating with the subscribers as T-Mobile continues to add more of them. Revenue growth was supported by rapid growth of the subscriber base. Simple Choice plans and the un-carrier theme is luring subscribers to opt for T-Mobile's services. The iPhone 6 was also one of the reasons behind this impressive subscriber momentum. T-Mobile claims that the iPhone 6 was its biggest launch ever. However, at the same time, aggressive pricing is weighing on earnings as it can be seen in deepening losses. Integration costs of MetroPCS also contributed to the earnings decline as T-Mobile shut down incompatible MetroPCS networks in Boston and Las Vegas.Penetration of simple choice plan is around 84%, up from 80% sequentially and 61% on a year-over year basis. Simple choice penetration will be in the range of 85%-90% by the end of 2014. This discounting strategy is affecting the postpaid ARPU that is down to $49.84, a decline of 5.3% on a year-over-year basis. However, the company is planning to improve data monetization by charging higher data rates from next year. T-Mobile is aggressively rolling out LTE. The company's LTE network now covers around 250 million people and it is targeting to cover 300 million people by the year-end 2015. T-Mobile claims that it is the fastest LTE network with average download speeds 12% faster than Verizon and 31% faster than AT&T. Regardless of this claim, indoor reception remains a problem. T-Mobile only has 9 MHz, out of its 83 MHz spectrum, in the 700MHz band meaning that 45% of the U.S. population and 30% of the company's existing customer base can experience indoor LTE reception difficulties.2015 will be a challenging year for T-Mobile, thanks to the low-band spectrum deficiency and FCC's decision to postpone low-band auction to 2016. T-Mobile must continue its aggressive pricing strategy if it wants to retain its subscriber momentum. If the company tries to improve its ARPU in 2015, expect alleviated churn rate during the year. Subscriber momentum continues to impress and I maintain the previous price target of $39. However, if the company stalls on subscriber growth or one of the two giant carriers cut on T-Mobile's pricing across all services that would be investors' cue to close their position in T-Mobile.For a detailed analysis, see ""T-Mobile: Organic Growth, Acquisitive Potential Justifies A 25% Upside"""
2598325,73315,2014-10-26T16:37:02-04:00,"T-Mobile is still small compared to competitors T and VZ.Financials are booming for the smaller telecommunications company relative to giants.Though seeing volatility today, low stock price may indicate a good time to get involved in the company.","T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) does not have the pull in the US telecommunications market to determine the industry on its own. For now, that privilege belongs to giants such as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). But while T-Mobile is a small player in comparison to these giants, TMUS' upcoming earnings reports could be a sign that the smaller company may soon make a play to seize a larger portion of the market.By the numbersAs alluded to above, TMUS is a big fish as long as investors look at the company in relation to other smaller telecom companies. But the boom experienced by the company over the last year may require analysts to change the way the company is viewed. If expectations can be trusted, the company will be reporting net income increases of 2543.8%. With the company exploding from last year quarter's income of $16 mn to a (relatively) whopping $75 mn, the massive increase in net incomes could signal the true entrance of T-Mobile into the larger market as a viable alternative to AT&T and Verizon.Before potential investors get too excited, keep things in perspective; AT&T posts revenues in the billions, with Verizon in a similar position. I am not suggesting TMUS can suddenly viably compete with the major power players in the market. Rather, I am suggesting that T-Mobile's boom of income could signal the early stages of a new major player on the market. This, of course, requires the consistent increase of earnings and company vision.EPS are expected to see a similar increase, rising from $.05 to $.34 a share annually. Taking both of these basic financial metrics into account paints T-Mobile as an industry leader, ahead of both S&P 500 averages and competitors (when considering percentage growth of finances).However, T-Mobile's stock gives less confidence to potential investors than what would be preferable. Though the beginning of the year saw the stock shoot up to almost $34 (and then flirt with $35 a share since then), the company's stock has underperformed, which would hardly justifying investment into a company whose ticker should be booming.The Bottom LineT-Mobile does and will not have the heft and weight of far larger telecommunications competitors, but there is undeniable growth in the company that is yet to be tapped by leadership. Though stocks are underperforming at present, the perfect time to invest in the company may be now before the company reports at the close of market Monday."
2559095,22148,2014-10-14T03:08:48-04:00,Iliad ends pursuit of acquiring a large position in T-Mobile.Investors should dump the stock.The original article anticipated that a positive outcome wasn't likely for a T-Mobile sell as time passed due to the ongoing price wars in the domestic wireless market.,"In a not very surprising move, Iliad (OTC: OTC:OTCPK:ILIAF) is dropping the intent to acquire a large portion of T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Though it was well established that the French telecom provider was interested in paying a higher price, than the current stock price of T-Mobile at around $27, the company hasn't been able or willing to buy the whole company that is majority owned by Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY).According to a press release by Iliad, the company was willing to up the bid to $36 (cash + share of value creation) from a previous offer in July of reportedly $33. The new offer increased the share to be acquired to 67% of T-Mobile likely leaving Deutsche Telekom stuck with a larger portion of T-Mobile than desired. Also, it isn't clear what portion of 'share of value creation' fit into the $36 offer or how it even works. Iliad suggests the deal would save the domestic wireless provider up to $2 billion annually, but it isn't straight forward how that benefits a shareholder accepting the offer price.The investment thesis from the original article ""Deutsche Telekom Wants Out Of T-Mobile And Now"" recommended that investors sell the stock unless an offer was quickly accepted after that publishing date at the end of August. The only positive outcome for investors stuck in the wireless provider facing a major pricing war in the domestic market was a buyout. With the pricing wars intensifying, investors should not expect an increased offer or a white knight to appear. The best scenario for any outsider is to wait for the dust to settle before picking up assets on the cheap. With earnings estimates declining for 2015, the stock still sells at an incredibly expensive 30x analyst estimates. Investors should avoid the stock.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
2512035,39231,2014-09-22T09:56:43-04:00,Company doing well by expanding postpaid subscriber base through ongoing strategic initiatives.Stays well on track to improving postpaid subscriber growth and competitive position in industry.Company likely to benefit from attractive pricing for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.,"I reiterate my bullish stance on T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). The increasing popularity of TMUS' Family plan offerings, un-carrier strategies and its attractive equipment installment plans are the key drivers behind the company's healthy subscriber base growth. Moreover, the growth in subscriber base is supporting its top-line growth. Also, the healthy top-line growth, and solid subscriber base, along with its cost reduction efforts are helping the company improve its EBITDA margin despite the intense competitive industry environment. I believe the company's equipment installment plan will continue to fuel its subscriber growth, which will portend well for TMUS' industry position; however, competitive pricing might keep its ARPU under pressure in the near term.Subscriber Growth Story in Continuation…In the highly competitive U.S. telecom market, the shift from device subsidy plans to no-contract plan offers has intensified competition in the industry. TMUS has been capitalizing on the change with its attractive offerings under the EIP (Equipment Installment Plan). TMUS' equipment installment plan, JUMP, has been attracting more subscribers and improving its subscriber base. Moreover, the company's continuously upgrading un-carrier strategies are also driving larger customer traffic towards it.So far, its recently announced un-carrier 5 and un-carrier 6 (free music streaming) have been successful. Also, the success of its equipment installment plan and un-carrier strategies have helped strengthen the company's postpaid subscriber base, as it reported 579,000 postpaid net additions in 2Q14. The company stays on track to achieve its postpaid subscriber addition guidance of 3-3.5 million for 2014. The company recently disclosed that it enjoyed record subscriber additions in August, last month. The company added 760,000 subscribers, including 552,000 postpaid subscribers and 208,000 prepaid subscribers.Also, the company's ongoing efforts to fuel subscriber base are portending well for top-line growth. For 2Q14, the company's service revenue growth outpaced its peers, as shown in the chart below.Source: Companies' Quarterly Earnings ReportIn efforts to further strengthen its subscriber base, the company has recently announced the un-carrier 7 strategy. Its un-carrier 7.0 ""Wi-Fi Un-leashed'' strategy allows its simple choice customer to use Wi-Fi calling and texting on all new smartphones sold by the company. The Wi-Fi services will be available through TMUS' personal CellSpot at no extra charges. Moreover, the strategy also allows a one-time open enrollment period to all JUMP customers. They can upgrade their device ahead of the expiration period.I believe this is a very intelligent initiative, which will enable TMUS to earn customer loyalty and improve churn in the coming quarters. Also, as the company will continue to roll out its un-carrier strategy, it will portend well for its subscriber base growth. The company's president and CEO, John Legere, said at the Goldman Sachs conference:Furthermore, the new un-carrier strategy announcement was well timed, as it came immediately after the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, with 4.7 and 5.5-inch retina displays, are designed to offer better display qualities. Customers with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus on TMUS' network will enjoy Wi-Fi calling experience on a better display. Moreover, as all carriers are aggressively trying to get a larger portion of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus subscriber base, the company's competitive pricing plans for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users are all ready to get a major chunk of iPhone subscribers. The following table shows the company's iPhone pricing plans.Source: Company's news roomMoreover, the company is actively deploying its 700MHZ spectrum to expand its network coverage and deliver a better network experience. To strengthen its spectrum holding and improve its network, TMUS is set to actively bid in the upcoming AWS3 spectrum auction that will be selling 1695-1715MHZ spectrum for low-uplink operations. Moreover, the company is entering into partnerships with several parties to boost the speed of its 700MHZ spectrum. I believe TMUS' efforts to improve and enhance its spectrum holding will help it attain its target of reaching 8.7 million POPs.Margins ExpansionThe company's efficient strategic initiatives have been on track for EBITDA margin expansion. Due to the company's strategic initiatives, its EBITDA margin for 2Q14 was 26%, as compared to 20% in 1Q14. As the company's subscriber base continues to grow, it will positively affect its top-line numbers and margins. Also, as the integration of MetroPCS is almost complete, the company will benefit from synergies; TMUS has anticipated cash synergies of 1.5 billion/year.ConclusionTMUS is doing well by expanding its postpaid subscriber base through ongoing strategic initiatives. The company, with its attractive un-carrier strategies, stays well on track to further uplift its postpaid subscriber growth and improve its competitive position in the industry. Also, the company is likely to benefit from its attractive pricing for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The company's strategic growth and cost reduction initiatives remain important growth drivers for its top-line and EBITDA margin growths. Due to the aforementioned factors, I am bullish on TMUS."
2493715,22148,2014-09-14T17:19:40-04:00,"T-Mobile announced record branded customer additions.Stock remains a short-term buy based on subscriber momentum.Subscriber additions were anticipated to help T-Mobile bounce back, but long-term issues loom with plunging earnings estimates.","At the Communacopia Conference, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) CEO John Legere announced that the company set a new record with 760,000 branded net customers for August. More importantly, the company had the biggest net postpaid add month in the history of the company at 552,000. The news continues the momentum of the aggressive marketing programs helping T-Mobile lead the domestic wireless industry with net subscriber additions.The net adds come at a price though. T-Mobile is on pace to exceed the 672,000 branded net adds in Q3 last year and roughly 1 million during the prior quarter. These net adds though are coming due to aggressive pricing including the program that charges only $100 for four lines of high-speed data. The price for these net adds due to price cuts are analysts slashing earnings estimates at a rapid rate. The numbers for 2015 are currently down to $0.80 from $1.12 at the start of August.TMUS EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YChartsThe momentum in T-Mobile subscriber additions offset by the impact to earnings continues the investment thesis in the article ""Deutsche Telekom Wants Out Of T-Mobile And Now"" that the stock is a short-term buy. If a deal doesn't take place soon, the wireless provider will face an aggressive Sprint (NYSE:S) combined with eventual efforts by the largest two wireless providers to squelch the uprising of T-Mobile. These price wars initiated by T-Mobile brought the company back to life, but it could be the undoing over the long-run. The positive scenario only works if T-Mobile attracts an acquirer with deep pockets, otherwise it ends up in a long-term race to the bottom that nobody in the domestic wireless sector will win long-term."
2527945,43941,2014-09-29T10:18:52-04:00,"Company posted record number of gross ads in August.
        Postpaid ARPU and churn rate don’t paint encouraging outlook for company.
        The company announced its new initiative with free WiFi calling and text messages.
        TMUS retains attractiveness for M&A activity.","The fourth largest telecommunication company in the U.S., T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) provides prepaid and postpaid wireless, voice and data services. The company reported a record number of gross ads in the month of August and is on its way to posting strong subscriber growth in the third quarter as well. However, I remain neutral on the company because of the falling ARPU and the elevated churn rate. Furthermore, Sprint (NYSE:S) has entered into the price war with attractive packages and also keen on improving its network experience. So, I believe it will impact TMUS' subscriber growth in the future. Although merger talks with S have ended, other companies have shown their interest in the matter and I expect the M&A activity will speed up in the last quarter of the year.Subscriber GrowthThe company continued its strong subscriber momentum in the current quarter as well. In the Goldman Sachs annual conference, the management highlighted that August was the best month in terms of subscriber additions in TMUS' history. The company has added 2.75 million gross ads in the last month. It includes 552K and 208K postpaid and prepaid subscribers, respectively. The postpaid porting ratio also paints an encouraging outlook for the company. CEO John Legere told analysts at the conference on September 12 that quarter-to-date, the porting ratio for the complete industry was greater than 2:1 in favor of TMUS. He specifically mentioned the quarter-to-date, the porting ratio from Sprint is 4:1 in favor of the company. He also pointed out that in no week of the current year has the porting ratio been in favor of any other carrier.This means the company is well on its way to reporting solid net additions in the third quarter. However, I believe there are some worrying signs for investors. First of all, branded postpaid phone churn and ARPU are worse than its peers, as shown in the figure below. In the table below, I have used data for the second quarter, which is the latest data available on these companies. Also, I do not expect any material improvement in TMUS' churn rate and ARPU in the current quarter.Secondly, S is a late entrant in the price war. Its low-priced attractive packages will gradually start to attract subscribers from other networks and I believe meaningful change is expected to be seen by the end of the current year. Furthermore, S continues to improve its network experience by building a robust 4G LTE framework. TMUS' $100 per month package for 4 lines has been very popular among subscribers, and while S offers the same 4 line package for $160, it also offers a data bucket of 20GB, which is twice what is being offered by TMUS.Source: Company's earnings presentationUn-Carrier 7.0 Earlier this month, the company announced its new initiative, Un-Carrier 7.0. The highlight of this new initiative is free WiFi calling and text messages. Every new smartphone sold from the TMUS platform will be enabled for free calls and text messages. Moreover, the company is also facilitating current subscribers to upgrade to WiFi calling and texting-enabled smartphones through its JUMP plan. With iOS8, iPhone users can now also enjoy this service. I believe it's a good approach, as it will divert data traffic to WiFi, which will reduce congestion on the network. It could also work well in those areas where the carrier has reception issue.To complement the WiFi service, TMUS is also offering Personal Cellspot to improve coverage within homes. It is free for customers who have WiFi call and text-enabled smartphones with a $25 deposit. Otherwise it will cost $99. Lastly, the company has announced a partnership with GoGo, which allows TMUS subscribers to free texts during flights.4G LTE FrameworkThe company has expanded its 4G LTE framework to 274 million POPs in the U.S. and the company continues to have the fastest 4G LTE services in the country. It also continues to deploy 700MHz low bandwidth spectrum to improve its coverage. TMUS has raised $3 billion in debt to participate in the FCC AWS-3 spectrum auction in 2014. Also, it has the capacity to raise another $5 billion for spectrum auctions next year, while keeping leverage to 4.0x.Consolidation S failed to successfully present its case to regulatory bodies on its merger with TMUS. So, S took a step back and ended its effort for the potential merger. However, TMUS continues to remain attractive for other companies. The CEO of the company said in the conference; ""We are a company that has a viable standalone path but a brand and capability that people are interested in.""In August, 2014, French telecom startup lliad offered $15 billion ($33 per share) for a 56.6% share in TMUS. The management rejected the deal as it was insufficient. Lliad continues to remain interested in TMUS and might raise its bid for the stakes in the company. Lliad, alongside its current lender, is meeting with several investors in the U.S. to finance the increased in bid. The French carrier is expected to partner with private equity fund KKR to raise $5-6 billion. However, lliad is expected to make the final bid by the middle of next month, which might be in a range of$35-$40 for a 60%-90% share in the company.On the other hand,Bloomberg reported that DISH Networks (NASDAQ:DISH) is also interested in acquiring TMUS after it is done with the FCC Spectrum auction in November. The second half of the year will be exciting, as two companies are expected to bid for stakes in TMUS. I believe that DISH has the better chance to succeed, as TMUS' management highlighted some criteria's for M&A in a dinner with the research house, Jefferies. The company should offer favorable financial terms and have a spectrum and subscriber base in the U.S. So these constraints tilt the balance in favor of DISH. However, nothing can be certain until and unless both companies quote their bidding prices.Final WordsThe company continued its solid subscriber growth in the third quarter as well with a record number of gross ads in the month of August. However, I remain cautious because postpaid ARPU and churn rate don't paint an encouraging outlook for the company. TMUS has also launched free calls and texts through WiFi, which will help increase its coverage and reduce its data traffic. Furthermore, the network continues to remain robust with the fastest 4G speeds in the U.S. The company also retains its attractiveness for potential M&A."

And as we noted just last month,Although the Sprint buyout (of T-Mobile) is off the table, Iliad (OTC:ILIAF) still wants a shot. The France-based telecom is trying to raise capital to increase its bid, where its $33 per share bid for 56.6% of T-Mobile was rejected by Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) last month. Deutsche could be open to taking $35 a share for T-Mobile - after trading close to $35 earlier this year, shares of T-Mobile are back down near $29 a share.T-Mobile is sure to get an additional boost from the iPhone 6 upgrade, which comes just as the company launched its Uncarrier 7.0 plan earlier this month. All this follows the best month ever for T-Mobile in terms of postpaid subscriber additions. Its uncarrier focus has been a success by all measures, with customers choosing to adopt T-Mobile's no contract services over the competition. The big news for Uncarrier 7.0 is that it allows mobile users to use Wi-Fi to make calls and send texts - which will be available for all its new smartphones, including the iPhone 6.T-Mobile could pass Sprint as early as the end of the year for the number three spot in the U.S. wireless telecom space. And in terms of porting (which is the ratio of customers switching to T-Mobile-to-those leaving T-Mobile for another carrier), T-Mobile's ratio versus Sprint is 4-to-1.Uncarrier 7.0 takes some risk off the tableIt's not without risks that T-Mobile is trying to build itself into a major telecom player. It has some $22 billion plus in debt (versus $3 billion cash). Granted it has been using that debt to grow its spectrum portfolio, while also taking on debt to buy up MetroPCS in 2013. In the grand scheme, its debt is only about half its market cap - which is in-line with AT&T's debt levels and below Verizon, which has as much debt as its market cap. Granted, these two leading players don't need to build up spectrum as robustly and quickly as T-Mobile.Nonetheless, with those debt levels, it might be tough for T-Mobile to acquire spectrum as aggressively as it would like. But with Uncarrier 7.0, it might not have to. The move to allow Wi-Fi calls and texts will help reduce the strain on T-Mobile's network, allowing it to leverage the growing number of Wi-Fi hotspots.Bottom lineWithout a dividend yield, T-Mobile won't be attracting income investors - AT&T and Verizon offer a 5.2% and 4.2% yield, respectively - but it's the growth potential that should be attracting investors to T-Mobile. Its cash flow and margins are running negative, but it's not all bad. The telecom's use of no-contracts and phone installment payment plans is sacrificing margins in the interim to build market share for the long-term. A risky strategy but one that we think will pay off for T-Mobile and its shareholders.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

I believe the move lower is mostly attributable to worries over the macroeconomic environment and thus has presented investors an opportunity to buy TMUS at an attractive price.TMUS data by YChartsSelling T-Mobile On Macroeconomic Fears Is A MistakeGlobal equity markets have moved lower as investors have started to fear a weakening global economy. Generally, the selling appears to be rooted in large part on a weakening economic outlook in the EU and China. Equity markets are also beginning to price in the possibility of slower growth in the U.S. economy. While these fears may or may not be valid, TMUS should not be sold based on macroeconomic fears. Firstly, the wireless telephone business is relatively recession resistant. Telecom stocks are often the strongest performing stocks during periods of economic weakness because their business is relatively recession resistant. Secondly, in addition to being in a recession resistant business TMUS is the ""cheap"" service provider. Due to its aggressive pricing, TMUS has been luring away a significant number of customers from AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and Sprint (NYSE:S). If the economy weakens, I would expect TMUS to gain even more customers as consumers look to save money by switching. For this reason, I believe selling TMUS based on macroeconomic fears is a mistake.Takeover TargetTMUS is a well known takeover target. Sprint had launched a bid to acquire TMUS for $40 but was forced to drop its bid in the face of regulatory pressure. France's Iliad previously offered $15 billion in cash at a price of $33 per share for a 56.6% stake in TMUS. Deutsche Telecom, the company that owns a controlling interest in TMUS, rejected the bid because it was too low. Iliad has considered raising its bid but on Monday walked away from the deal. In addition to Iliad, another potential buyer of TMUS is Dish (NASDAQ:DISH). Dish has already expressed interest in the past and has been said to be considering a bid for TMUS. At this point, with Iliad walking away and Sprint unable to complete a deal because of regulatory issues, Dish seems like the most likely bidder.ConclusionAt under $27, where TMUS is trading as of this writing, I believe shares offer a very attractive risk reward for investors. Any bid from Dish or other interested party is likely to result in a price between $33-$37, which represents a significant premium over TMUS's current share price. Even if a bid does not materialize over the short term, which has become increasingly likely now that Iliad has walked away, TMUS is poised to move higher even if the economy slows due to its positioning as the low-cost service provider."
2501835,80135,2014-09-17T11:53:28-04:00,"T-Mobile continues to add subscribers due to aggressive pricing plans like Simple Choice.There is evidence of network quality improvement, and the company is further investing in airwaves.Going forward, T-Mobile is planning to maintain subscriber momentum through differentiated offerings that will result in stable ARPU.Price target is upgraded to $39 amid organic growth prospects and acquisitive potential of T-Mobile.","The U.S. telecom industry is in a price-war mode right now. After the drop scene of T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS)/Sprint (NYSE:S) merger, price aggression became more intense as both the underdogs are fighting for subscriber gains. The industry is set to feel margin pressure going forward. Anyhow, T-Mobile is turning out to be the primary beneficiary of price aggressive environment as it is adding subscribers at an impressive rate. Recent developments indicate that coverage and quality of T-Mobile's service is improving. It is offering several unique services to improve user experience. Moreover, the company is in a unique position to make good for investors under current circumstances (details later). Because of all these factors, a relatively higher price target is justified for T-Mobile. The rest of this report is dedicated to explore recent developments related to T-Mobile. A revised price target is also derived at the end.Subscriber growthT-Mobile has been consistently adding subscribers for quite some time now. In the month of August, the company added a record breaking 552,000 postpaid subscribers. It also added 208,000 prepaid subscribers in the same month. Although adoption of simple choice plan was the primary reason behind subscriber growth, I believe that improvement in network quality also helped the cause. Simple choice plan allows subscribers to add four lines with unlimited call, text and 10GB data for $100 per month. Simple choice plan penetration currently stands at around 80%, and it is expected to increase to 85%-90% by the end of the year. Note that this will result in reduced average revenue per user for the year-ended 2014 as compared to previous years. However, T-Mobile's CEO John Legere believes that ARPU will increase due to higher data rates next year. ""We are going to expand data monetization,"" he said.Overall, consistent subscriber growth is a positive sign for T-Mobile. Subscriber momentum will continue to drive valuation of T-Mobile. Decline in ARPU will not affect stock price as information related to ARPU pressure is being disseminated to investors for quite some time now, which is effectively transferred into stock price. Besides, ARPU is going to stabilize during next year. All in all, subscriber growth bodes well for T-Mobile and its investors.Coverage and qualityT-Mobile is beefing up its network. Signs are quite positive on this front. The company has acquired 700 MHz block-A spectrum covering 9 million POPs, according to the CTO of the company. T-Mobile is also raising debt to purchase additional AWS spectrum that will result in higher data speeds and more capacity in densely populated areas. Moreover, FCC's rules for spectrum auction next year are favorable for T-Mobile and Sprint as part of airwaves are reserved for underserved players in the low-frequency space. The point is that these waves are a key to good quality network. T-Mobile's network improved over the past year, thanks to block A 700 MHz waves purchased from Verizon (NYSE:VZ). More airwaves will further improve capacity and quality of its network. Recent competitive positioning of the company follows:According to rootmetrics 1H 2014 report, T-Mobile secured third place in overall performance as compared to fourth place in 2H 2013 indicating performance improvement.Source: rootmetrics 1H2014Rootmetrics also released midyear airport review measuring how carrier networks perform in airports. According to this report, T-Mobile was ahead in 20 airports as compared to only 9 airports last year. Overall, T-Mobile secured second place behind Verizon in the midyear airport review.Data extracted from rootmetrics airport reviewOpenSignal, a crowd sourced network analysis company, ranks T-Mobile in 3rd spot. According to their data, T-Mobile offers the fastest average download speed as compared to its counterparts.Source: OpenSignalOokla also shows higher average download speed for T-Mobile as compared to AT&T (NYSE:T). Its statistics reveal average download of 11.68 MB/s for T-Mobile as compared to 11.18 MB/s for AT&T.Source: OoklaThe metrics presented above indicate that network quality and coverage of T-Mobile is improving. Being in front of Sprint is also beneficial for the company in this price aggressive environment.Differentiated offeringsIn its latest un-carrier move, T-Mobile introduced several differentiated services including WiFi calling, in-plane texting and personal cell spot.In WiFi enabled calling, the phone will automatically switch between networks without dropping the call. T-Mobile is deploying enhanced single radio voice call continuity, or eSRVCC, so that calls don't drop when the user moves into areas without LTE coverage. The company's CTO writes in a blog post thatMoreover, no extra app is required for WiFi calling resulting in improved user experience. No other carrier offers this service, according to a T-Mobile executive.T-Mobile partnered with GoGo to deliver in-flight texting and voice mail. This service will be available in more than 2000 commercial aircrafts. The company is also offering personal cell spot to eliminate call drops in enclosed areas like basements. Cell spot can work as a router or it can work parallel to an existing router.Seamless WiFi connectivity gives T-Mobile a competitive edge while personal cell spot is an impressive way to address the limitations of having inadequate low-band spectrum. The recent un-carrier move indicates that T-Mobile is not just slashing prices; it is also delivering value in the form of innovative solutions. I think these services powered by T-Mobile's intelligent marketing will resonate with the customers, and subscriber momentum is expected to continue in quarters to come.Acquisitive potentialSubscriber momentum, improvement in coverage and quality of network and currently unveiled un-carrier offers add to the acquisitive potential of T-Mobile. Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) is in a much better position to negotiate a deal now. Iliad (OTCPK:ILIAY) is already seeking partners to sweeten the deal. On top of that, Dish network (NASDAQ:DISH) is also interested in T-Mobile. Bloomberg reports that Dish's Charlie Ergen recently approached Deutsche Telekom to say that he is interested in the acquisition of T-Mobile. Dish may be interested in buying T-Mobile after November's airwaves auction.The point is that T-Mobile is attracting acquisition related interest. This merger related speculation can result in appreciation of stock price. And a potential merger deal can range from $35-$39 per share translating into valuation gains for T-Mobile investors. Even if acquisition play doesn't pan out, T-Mobile is looking good organically as evident from the details explored above.Investment value and final thoughtsStock valuation of the company is expected to trend higher amid subscriber momentum. Although, subscriber growth was initiated by aggressive price strategy in the past few quarters, going forward, the company will sustain subscriber growth amid improved coverage, network quality and differentiated offerings. WiFi calling, in-flight texting and personal cell spot will resonate with potential subscribers. All in all, there is no sign of a slowdown in subscriber growth. Hence, the stock will most probably head higher.Moreover, T-Mobile is uniquely positioned to reward investors. Verizon and AT&T have relatively high ARPU, which is factored into their stock prices. Reduction in ARPU from both these players will result in their respective valuation decline. On the other hand, T-Mobile and Sprint are already pricing aggressively, which is reflected in their stocks. So, ARPU related valuation decline is not expected in these stocks. Further, T-Mobile's network is better than Sprint's to begin with. Therefore, T-Mobile has more potential to attract subscribers.Investors of Verizon and AT&T are at risk from price cuts, but T-Mobile's ARPU reduction is already factored in its valuation. T-Mobile has no plan to offer more deep discounts as the CEO points out that ARPU will stabilize next year amid higher data rates. In a nutshell, T-Mobile's stock is already affected by price cuts; no more price cuts are expected. Hence, downside risk is very low. However, upside potential is healthy amid subscriber growth and stabilizing ARPU going forward. Cash flow based valuation follows:Assumptions FocusEquity estimatesPrice target reveals a potential upside of around 25%. Investors should note that a position in T-Mobile should be closed once the company stalls on subscriber growth.In my view, T-Mobile will continue to add subscribers in quarters to come as its pricing plans, un-carrier offerings and marketing strategy is resonating with consumers. The company will gain subscribers at the expense of Sprint because of its better call and data services. T-Mobile remains a buy on its organic growth and acquisitive potential."
2461825,22148,2014-08-31T05:23:09-04:00,"Deutsche Telekom lowered the hurdle for buying T-Mobile.The potential acquirers face debt concerns, especially if Deutsche Telekom still wants mostly cash.Domestic wireless war is likely pressuring Deutsche Telekom to exit via a lower offer.","Apparently the $33 offer for T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) from Iliad (OTC:ILIAF) that was brushed off as ""inadequate"" is suddenly close to good enough. According to Bloomberg, Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) has let it be known that an offer of $35 a share or more (why would anybody offer more?) is enough to snatch away the fourth largest wireless provider in the U.S. market.The news smacks of desperation from the 67% owner of T-Mobile after Sprint (NYSE:S) pulled out from a proposal that was rumored near $40. With Sprint withdrawing after facing regulatory issues, Deutsche Telekom is left watching the value of the assets erode with Sprint embarking on a pricing war. The Bloomberg article though failed to discuss whether Deutsche Telekom is still focused on a deal for mostly cash so that it can exit the position. The cash requirement is a big issue for a potential suitor like Dish Networks (NASDAQ:DISH) that is already loaded with debt.Not Paid To WaitAn investment in T-Mobile has quickly become a gamble. The company does have appealing assets, but the suddenly competitive domestic wireless market could erode away some of the value. Not to mention, any lack of financing to bid competitively in the upcoming spectrum auctions will seriously hamper future growth.Partly due to the wireless pricing war, analysts are quickly ratcheting down the earnings estimates for next year. Only 30 days ago, T-Mobile was forecast to earn $1.11 in 2015. The number is now down to $0.96 and will probably take further hits.With the stock trading around $30, one can easily see where the stock is attractive to buy for a quick gain if an offer for $35 or more reaches the desk of Deutsche Telekom. What happens if nobody shows up with an offer of that much?Dicey DebtHonestly, Dish Networks makes the most sense of the remaining options. The satellite provider could team up its pay-TV network with the wireless network of T-Mobile to offer a bundle that Sprint and Verizon won't have an offering to compete. Of course, AT&T (NYSE:T) is in the process of closing on a deal for DirecTV (NYSE:DTV) questioning whether a combination of this nature could compete against the leaders in both categories.For Dish Networks to consummate a deal for T-Mobile that would cost over $25 billion, some level of stock is probably a requirement. Dish already has $4.5 billion in net debt and would have to assume nearly $20 billion of debt from T-Mobile. How much more debt could Dish Networks add to complete the deal is a big question and a deterrent for a bid.According to Moody's a few weeks back, the firm suggested several scenarios where Dish Networks would push the debt envelope on a deal for T-Mobile at $37. Now that we know that price would work, the big question is whether Deutsche Telekom would accept a deal with a significant amount of cash involved. Even with a deal of 50% stock and 50% cash, Moody's estimates leverage of the new company would equal 5.7x EBITDA. The other scenarios offered by Moody's involve buying only portions of the company including just the Deutsche Telekom stake for 70% cash. Moody's estimates the need to spend roughly $6 billion on the spectrum auction.ConclusionThe fact that Deutsche Telekom made it known that an inadequate offer only a few weeks back is now close to acceptable smells of desperation. The pricing wars in the domestic wireless market can't be encouraging and a deal for T-Mobile at 35x 2015 earnings is probably more than adequate contrary to original proclamations. The recommendation is that risk averse investors hold onto T-Mobile for a quick offer that nets them $35, but the longer this lingers without news, the quicker the sell button should be hit.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

2493395,67313,2014-09-14T09:28:25-04:00,"TMUS added 760k branded subs in August with 552k being postpaid.Higher subs were driven by attractive data plans.Free WiFi calling reduces churn, while Apple iPhone 6 makes it competitive against rivals.","At the Goldman Conference last week, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) CEO John Legere said that TMUS added 552k postpaid customers in August, which is the most postpaid add that the company saw in its history. In addition, the company also added 208k pre-paid customers. The main driver behind the strong postpaid add is the introduction of $100/month data plan that allows up to 10GB of LTE data shared between four lines. This indicates that TMUS' strategy of offering low price data packages under its shared plan is winning the endorsement from the price conscious consumers. The recently announced free WiFi calling could be another hook to maintain the momentum to subs growth. I remain positive on TMUS post Legere's speech.Best month in historyTMUS added 760k branded adds in August alone in what is considered the best operating month in the company's history. Of the branded adds, 552k were postpaid and 208k were prepaid. To fully understand the significance of the number, TMUS added 672k branded net adds in the entire 3Q13. Even for 2Q14, TMUS added 1.01m branded subs. The August add figure suggests that TMUS could surpass 1.5m branded adds in the upcoming 3Q.The main reason behind the surge in subs is the $100/month plan that allows four devices to share 10GB of LTE data. However, this offer only lasts until January 2, 2016 after which the data quota decreases to 4GB of LTE data. While this may indicate that subs could churn off the network once the data quota decreases, I expect TMUS to introduce a comparable plan (potentially lower priced plan) to keep the customers on its network and avoid churn.After all, the company has over a year to figure out a clever way to prevent high churn, and the recent introduction of the free WiFi calling is a nice service to have and will significantly enhance customer experience in the suburban or the rural areas where coverage is limited. The obvious implication is that churn can be maintained, but I think the long-term implication is that TMUS could significantly lower its capex by using WiFi for data offloading and that could alleviate potential spectrum congestion.iPhone 6 evens up the playing fieldTMUS said that 80% of its customers are on the no-contract Simple Choice plan and expects that number to reach 85-90% by the end of the year. While the plan currently results in lower ARPU, Legere expects ARPU to elevate starting next year, as price war subdues and TMUS introduces higher priced data plans.The iPhone 6 could spur one of the biggest upgrade cycles in the history of smartphone and TMUS having the iPhone 6 places it on the equal playing field as rival AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). In addition, carriers require iPhone 6 users to sign up for higher data packages, which effectively raised the overall ARPU. With bundling unlimited WiFi calling, iPhone 6, and affordable shared data plans, TMUS is well positioned to compete against the larger players and maintain the current momentum of subs growth."
2452755,41741,2014-08-26T17:46:08-04:00,"Although a Sprint deal is off the table, there's still other suitors.There's a motivated seller in T-Mobile's parent company.And there's plenty of value in T-Mobile's business model given its industry-changing initiatives.","Sprint (NYSE:S) is done with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), but the stock has held up fairly well. Sprint is down over 30% since the announcement that it was passing on T-Mobile. However, shares of T-Mobile are only down some 12% over the last month.Even after the deal fell apart, T-Mobile CEO John J. Legere took to Twitter to revive the competition between the two companies. But it looks like Legere might be cocky for a reason. With its 2013 acquisition of MetroPCS, T-Mobile has turned itself into a viable number 4 player in the U.S. wireless industry. With the strength the company is seeing, could it in fact do without merging?It appears that Sprint needed to merge more than T-Mobile. Sprint continues to lose customers, despite its efforts to boost its network by forking out billions in network upgrades.Government regulators have made it clear that they would oppose any combination of any two of the four biggest wireless carriers, with the FCC chairman noting that four national wireless service providers benefit American consumers. That doesn't mean T-Mobile won't be sold to someone else.Deutsche Telekom, which owns two-thirds of T-Mobile, would like to exit the US market and the Sprint transaction would have provided a speedy one. T-Mobile has attracted takeover interest because it has managed to grow its customer base nicely with aggressive marketing. Already, French mobile operator Iliad has offered $15 billion for 56.6% of the company and satellite TV operator DISH Network has hinted that it also may be interested.Any hope left?A number of telecom giants have expressed interest in the takeover in the past to no avail, including AT&T (NYSE:T) in 2011 and now Softbank and Sprint. Iliad has said its recent bit is a substantial premium over the price before market rumors took effect. Estimates had placed the Sprint at $40 per share.AT&T had to pay breakup fees totaling an estimated $4 billion, with Sprint's breakup fee expected to be between $1 billion and $2 billion. We look for T-Mobile to put that money to work, further growing its market share, much like it was able to do with the $4 billion from AT&T.Deutsche Telekom does not favor the Iliad bid because the lack of presence in the United States would add no value to T-Mobile. However, Iliad does have an advantage - the fact that it has no U.S. operations means the bid would not be blocked on antitrust grounds. DISH Network has an even bigger advantage because it is a domestic U.S. company with no overlapping interests in telecommunications.In terms of numbers of subscribers, the company now ranks first in the country in terms of prepaid wireless plans and fourth in terms of postpaid plans. The company has been able to use its relatively small size to catalyze growth over the last few quarters. The beauty of T-Mobile is that its no-contract model is gaining traction. This has helped put the industry in upheaval. 2Q saw double-digit profit growth.Bottom lineShares trade at 7.6x EV/EBITDA, above the other major wireless telecoms. But T-Mobile remains in play. Its parent company Deutsche Telekom has a lock up period through November 2015 in that it can't sell its shares. But it appears it has a long-term strategy of exiting the U.S. market. That means M&A traction is the likely outlet. Its parent company, Deutsche Telekom, did reject the Iliad offer, but DISH could still be a suitor. DISH got left out when AT&T decided to pursue DirecTV (NYSE:DTV).Look for T-Mobile to be a buyout candidate in the next few months, but if not, it's still positioned to continue eating Sprint's lunch, possibly getting to the point that it's a major competitor to Verizon and AT&T."
2402505,69965,2014-08-08T13:49:42-04:00,Postpaid customers are leaving.Prepaid customers are leaving.Debt is rising even without the rumored T-Mobile buyout.,"Sprint (NYSE:S) investors might be interested in whether the company will buy T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). However, this company has serious problems, and even buying T-Mobile might not be enough to save the stock. The company's new ""Framily"" plans seem to offer a good value to customers, but customers are still leaving and Sprint's balance sheet is getting worse.As the Framily ChurnsWhether Sprint wants to promote its Framily plans with a hamster in a ball or the goth ""Gor-don"" doesn't seem to matter. Though its commercials are memorable, customers are still leaving. Looking at Sprint's postpaid customer churn rate compared to AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), there is clearly a problem.Source: SEC filings.With Sprint going head to head with its larger competitors every day for postpaid business, having a churn rate that is nearly double its peers is very troubling. If investors think that T-Mobile is going to save Sprint in this area, consider that in the last three months T-Mobile's postpaid churn was 1.5%. The first reason it doesn't matter if Sprint buys T-Mobile is that even the combined company would be losing postpaid customers at a faster rate than either AT&T or Verizon.Customers Are Walking Away Here TooThe second reason it may not matter if Sprint buys T-Mobile is that the combined prepaid business looks weaker by the quarter. The simple truth of prepaid wireless is that customers walk away from prepaid plans easier than postpaid plans. The reason is that with no contract, if something changes there is nothing to tie the customer to Sprint or T-Mobile.On the flip side, while AT&T and Verizon both offer prepaid plans, the vast majority of their wireless subscribers are on postpaid plans. We already know that these two huge companies have postpaid churn of nearly 1%; do Sprint investors think the company's prepaid churn of 4.3% in the current quarter is a good comparison?The scary part is that Sprint's prepaid churn rate is rising. Last quarter the company reported prepaid churn of 3.22%. Again, if investors are hoping T-Mobile will make things better, its prepaid churn rate last quarter was 4.3%. With both companies showing a greater than 4% prepaid churn, competing against the more postpaid focused AT&T and Verizon is a questionable proposition at best.Debt, Debt, and More DebtDebt has been a huge challenge for Sprint for years and a big part of why Softbank's investment was such an important event for the company. However, Softbank may have to continue to support Sprint with more cash based on the rumored T-Mobile merger.The third reason it may not matter if Sprint buys T-Mobile is that the company's long-term debt is growing even without T-Mobile. In fact, over the last year, Sprint's net long-term debt has expanded by more than 8%. This wouldn't be a huge deal, except Sprint reported core free cash flow (net income + depreciation - capex) of negative $340 million.Considering that AT&T generated over $2.6 billion in core free cash flow, and Verizon produced over $6 billion, Sprint is already playing at a huge disadvantage. If T-Mobile is going to solve this problem, investors need to think again.While the company does generate positive free cash flow, T-Mobile carries net long-term debt of $14 billion, and expects to spend at least $4 billion on capital expenditures in the next year. Given that Sprint would have to acquire T-Mobile and its debt, the company's debt balance is sure to balloon if this deal goes through.Final ThoughtsThe truth is, Sprint's customers are leaving in droves in both the postpaid and prepaid spaces. In an industry with AT&T and Verizon both concentrating on postpaid customers, and posting churn rates that are much lower, Sprint is already fighting an uphill battle.If Sprint buys T-Mobile, not only will the company's balance sheet likely get worse, but the company's churn won't improve enough to compete with its larger peers. Investors may be excited about the combined company, but the facts say that there are several reasons it may not matter if Sprint buys T-Mobile.Disclosure: The author is long VZ.

2395235,43941,2014-08-07T11:45:40-04:00,Company posted strong postpaid and prepaid net additions in second quarter.Continues to invest heavily in network and expand 4G LTE framework.TMUS suffers from declining ARPU and high churn rate.,"T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) is the fourth largest telecom company in the U.S. It provides prepaid and postpaid wireless, voice and data services. The company has posted strong second quarter results and has continued its solid subscriber momentum, but I remain neutral on the company. The strong subscriber momentum was offset by a decline of 8.7% in average revenue per unit (ARPU). Furthermore, Sprint Corporation (NYSE:S) has called off the merger plans with TMUS, which I believe is a loss for the company. Also I continue to prefer Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T, Inc (NYSE:T) in the telecom space.Subscriber MomentumThe company reported postpaid net ads of 908K. The solid subscriber momentum was driven by solid phone only net ads of 579K, the highest in the industry. Of these 579K phone net ads, only 85K subscribers migrated from the company's prepaid segment. The remaining 494k subscribers were added organically. The company recently announced that it now has 15.64 million wireless prepaid customers and has become the largest player in the prepaid market place. In the second quarter of the year, TMUS added 102K prepaid net ads, which highlights the significant improvement from a loss of 87K in the second quarter of the last year.I am expecting the subscriber momentum to continue in the second half of the year as well due to strong smartphone sales expected with the launch of the iPhone 6 later in the year. Furthermore, the company has reduced prices for families, which will attract subscriber growth in the future. TMUS itself has raised its postpaid net ads guidance for 2014 to 3.0-3.5 million from 2.8-3.3 million.However, the declining ARPU is a worrying sign for investors. It declined by 8.7% YOY in the second quarter and reached $49.32. So, the strong subscriber momentum was somewhat offset by the declining ARPU. Although TMUS managed to stabilize its postpaid churn to 1.5% in the competitive environment, it is still way higher than the 0.94% and 0.86% churns of its peers, VZ and T, respectively.Other Important IndicatorsThe company's 4G LTE framework has expanded to 325 metro areas and is available to almost 233 million people. Wide-band LTE has been launched in 17 markets and it is expected to reach 26 markets by the end of the year. It also started to deploy 700 MHz A-band spectrum, which will increase its coverage and hence reduce roaming expenses. But still the company's 4G LTE outreach is less than VZ and T.TMUS also reported that it had the fastest 4G LTE download speeds of 19.3 Mbps, followed by VZ, T and S. Furthermore, it is also ranked the highest in wireless customer care by J. D. Power.MetroPCS' integration is also going faster than expected. Nearly 66% of MetroPCS' customer base has been captured by TMUS and almost 60% of the spectrum is integrated to the GSM network. It has helped the company expand its prepaid customer base to 15.64 million, the largest in the U.S.Merger Talks Break DownIn my previous article, I discussed that the joint bid for the spectrum auction was just an attempt to build a case for a merger between TMUS and S. Both these companies were trying to show regulators that by bidding together, they could compete more aggressively with larger telecom giants. It was difficult to convince the FCC because TMUS was already competing well with its highest subscriber growth in the first quarter of the year. On the other hand, S failed to attract investors even though it holds the largest spectrum, which is key to improving network quality.Recently, S decided to back down from its plan to acquire TMUS because it failed to win approval from regulatory authorities. Tom Wheeler, the Chairman of the FCC said last Wednesday; ""Four national wireless providers is good for American consumers."" It came as no surprise when the FCC, like it has in the past, rejected the deal between T and TMUS. Furthermore, this statement has made it crystal clear that there is no future consolidation expected among the top four.However, I believe the competitive pressure will further build up in the telecommunication space. S has announced to appoint a new Chief Executive, Marcelo Claure. His focus will be to complete its network transformation and leverage its large spectrum holdings to provide a superior network experience to its subscribers. Furthermore, I also believe that soon S will also start to aggressively compete with lower pricing to attract new subscribers. TMUS and T are already successfully implementing this strategy. Mark Stodden, an analyst at Moody's Investor, is reported to have said, ""Without the ability to compete on scale they are going to have to compete on price, so the two smaller competitors may become increasingly desperate to maintain market share and could become irrational in pricing, which could cause disruptions in pricing in the industry.""Overall, I believe this is a loss for TMUS' shareholders, as the company was trading at the highest Enterprise to EBITDA multiple of 7.93x, among its peer companies. Also, it was expected that S would pay some price in the range of a high $30 to low $40 per share for TMUS' shares. At that time, the price of the share was around $32, which meant significant benefit was in store for TMUS' shareholders in a merger scenario. Furthermore, as mentioned above, competitive pressure will increase from S, as it will also start to push its services at lower rates.Final WordsThe company posted strong postpaid and prepaid net additions in the second quarter. It also continues to invest heavily in its network and expand its 4G LTE framework. However, the declining ARPU and high churn rate, relative to its peers, makes my stance neutral on the company. Furthermore, S and TMUS failed to win over a perceived approval from the FCC for a possible merger, which does not bode well for TMUS.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Also, competition in the industry has significantly increased in the recent past, and companies are enhancing and expanding their network coverage to compete more efficiently. As the industry environment remains competitive, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is looking to enhance its low band spectrum footprint.According to recent news, TMUS and Sprint (NYSE:S) are planning to jointly bid to acquire low band spectrum in the upcoming spectrum auction. The low band spectrum, with its high penetration, wide area coverage and fast speeds will strengthen the network coverage of carriers in the U.S. The FCC has partially restricted the participation of AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in the upcoming auction, owing to the fact that they already have access to a large chunk of low band spectrum. The joint spectrum bid by TMUS and S is also believed to strengthen a possible merger case between the two companies.Given that mobile data usage increased immensely in the recent past, the demand of low band spectrum, which has high area coverage and deep penetration, is on the rise. As for now, the two North American telecom sector giants, T and VZ, own a large percentage of the available low band spectrums, as shown in the table below.Source: BloombergAs the 600MHZ low band spectrum auction is set to be held in mid-2015, all four big players are interested in acquiring spectrum. Owing to their current small spectrum holdings, S and TMUS are planning for a joint venture agreement to raise $10 billion for the upcoming auction. If S and TMUS enter the auction individually, the two wouldn't be able to buy significant spectrum with their relatively weaker pool of resources, as compared to T and VZ. As TMUS and S have less low band spectrum holdings, the joint bid will help the companies acquire more spectrum, which will not only improve their network coverage, but will also help them compete effectively.As far as TMUS is concerned, the joint bid with S is very important for the company in terms of enhancing its low band spectrum footprint. In the recent past, TMUS has been criticized for lagging behind its peers in terms of network quality and coverage. TMUS recently made a $2.4 billion cash payment to acquire VZ's A-Block spectrum.On the other hand, S, which currently tops all other carriers in terms of its spectrum holdings, has a different motive to support the joint venture. In fact, S wants to strengthen its case before the FCC for a merger with TMUS and wants the FCC to realize that the merger with TMUS could benefit customers through a wider area coverage and service enhancement.While these two small players are teaming up for the spectrum auction, the big industry players, namely VZ and T, are not sitting idle. Although VZ has already rolled out its XLTE or AWSF network to 350 markets, to reinforce its network advantage, the company has shown a keen interest in buying a major chunk of low band spectrum in the upcoming auction.On the other hand, T has the highest holdings of low band spectrum, and it still intends to bid in the upcoming auction; it has set aside $9 billion for the auction. As the company is actively rolling out its LTE footprint, it expects the auction to carve its path for the 2x10MHZ spectrum.Conclusion  In efforts to keep the industry more competitive, the FCC has partially restricted the bidding power of VZ and T in the upcoming auction with its new regulations for the spectrum auction. The joint bid by TMUS and S will help the companies acquire meaningful spectrum holding, which otherwise would not have been possible due to their scarce resources. Also, TMUS and S will be able to enhance and expand their network coverage with the acquisition of low band spectrum. Moreover, the joint bid might also strengthen the TMUS and S merger case.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2321595,68505,2014-07-17T19:04:29-04:00,,"[Originally published 6/20/2014]You may recall a few months back I ripped into Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) for their role in the net neutrality debacle.And more recently, I let Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have it, upset about its bullying business tactics, eroding customer service and corporate censorship.It's not that I like to beat up on abusive companies.Well, ok, I do enjoy that a little. Nothing gets the juices flowing better than a frustrating conversation with robotic telephone trees and outsourced email exchanges.No - the main reason I talk about companies behaving badly is that it's a significant leading indicator of trouble.There are plenty of technical indicators I pay attention to, and plenty of financial signposts I heed. But nothing is quite as visceral - or as immediate - as on-the-ground experience, good and bad.It always takes several quarters for bad behavior to start showing up on spreadsheets. But - absent a change of course - you know it's coming, especially when you aren't talking about singular anecdotes, but widespread consumer discontent.That's why I love to expose corporate malpractice. Some analysts think that such things don't matter much, as long as the money keeps flowing. They're wrong. Customer experience is one of the better indicators of future growth.Still, as much as I enjoy nailing bad actors, I'd hate to get a reputation. So today, I'm going to do the opposite - let's talk about a company that's doing everything right. And it's one that will reap the benefits soon enough.In fact, it's already started.The UncarrierI'm talking today about T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). While most talking heads think of the fourth-largest mobile carrier as an also-ran, they're missing the boat.In fact, being in fourth place is part of why T-Mobile is changing the game. They've been losing the carrier wars for awhile now. So they looked for the biggest weakness to exploit.And they found it pretty easily. Just like cable customers, mobile users had a single, large complaint: customer service.So what does T-Mobile do? It strikes at the belly of the beast. It has gone so far as to call itself the ""uncarrier"" - since mobile carriers have such a toxic reputation.But it's not just talk. First, T-Mobile eliminated the two-year contract. Then it detached phones from service - you could buy a phone outright, get it at a contract rate and pay it off over time, or bring a phone over and use it at a discounted rate.Or just pay that discounted rate once you'd paid off your phone. Or get a new phone every month - whatever you wanted.Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T) quickly answered with similar services, but with more gimmick and less substance.And they still didn't match T-Mobile's offers. For instance, T-Mobile will pay any early termination fee for new sign-ups who want out of a lousy contract.Instead of charging insanely expensive penalties for data overages, T-Mobile just slows the Internet down if you've used up all your data. The list goes on.And on Wednesday, another offering was added. Now, on T-Mobile most streaming music services are free.That's not to say it will buy you a Spotify subscription. But any music service you use won't count against your data cap - and will remain high-speed, no matter how much data you've used.To some, that sounds like a fancy way of installing a biased internet. But CEO John Legere says T-Mobile isn't charging a dime to any of the streaming services, and the company will be quick to add any new music services that may pop up.That's some powerful stuff. T-Mobile is now, hands-down, the most customer-friendly carrier out there.And it's working. The past year, T-Mobile has added a minimum million net subscribers each quarter, with the first three months of this year seeing a record 2.4 million new customers.Now, there is a cost. These friendly services do cost money and eat into margins. But when you're fourth, you need to worry about getting those customers in the first place. And T-Mobile is doing a brilliant job.Still, the future is a little cloudy. The big dogs may decide to offer similar plans, in order to stay competitive. And T-Mobile's rumored $32 billion merger with Sprint (NYSE:S) means everything might change again in the near-future.But Legere swears these programs will continue through any merger. And if we see this sort of customer-centric service from a new behemoth - Sprint and T-Mobile combined would be about as big as the other huge carriers - then look out world.I love beating up on companies that abuse their customers - knowing that the day of reckoning will come.But I also love giving love to companies that treat customers right.Those companies get a day of reckoning too. Only that day winds up with a lot of very happy, wealthy investors.Just ask the top company in virtually all customer surveys - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Will T-Mobile have a similar turnaround? Time will tell. But right now, it is making all the right steps. There are worse places to park your money.Disclosure: None"
2389985,39231,2014-08-06T15:21:46-04:00,"Company has been growing its postpaid subscriber base with strategic initiatives that are fueling top-line growth.
        Subscriber base growth seems strong with company’s commitment to introducing innovative un-carrier strategies and family plan offerings.
        TMUS’ strong EBITDA margin growth trend likely to continue.","I reiterate my bullish stance on T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). The company recently reported strong 2Q14 results, primarily driven by excellent postpaid subscriber additions, well ahead of analyst expectations. The growing penetration of TMUS' Simple Choice Plan and consistent up gradation of un-carrier strategies are growing its postpaid subscriber base and benefiting top-line growth. Moreover, the company's healthy revenue growth coupled with efficient cost management initiatives are positively benefiting its EBITDA. On the other hand, the company's equipment installment program has strengthened its subscriber base, but has pressurized its ARPU, which I believe will continue in the near term due to competitive initiatives undertaken by TMUS to address competition.The Growing Subscribers BaseIn the recent past, in efforts to grow its subscriber base and address the intense competition in the industry, dominant North American wireless carriers like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have undertaken competitive pricing and introduced equipment installment programs. TMUS, with its Simple Choice Plan and ETF (early termination fee) plan, is not only surviving the competitive industry but is also doing well to grow its service revenue. Moreover, by continuously updating its un-carrier strategies, the company is consistently growing its subscriber base.As for now, the company's un-carrier 5 strategy (7 day test drive of the iPhone 5s) and the un-carrier 6 strategy (free music streaming) have been strengthening its subscriber base; TMUS enjoyed 908,000 net postpaid additions in 2Q14. Moreover, the company remains committed to soon introducing its un-carrier 7 strategy, which I believe will further strengthen its subscriber base in the long run. The company also reported 329,000 mobile broadband additions, mostly tablets, as customers were attracted towards the company's tablet freedom strategy, which offers up to 1GB of free data every month. Owing to the success of the tablet freedom strategy, TMUS expects to strengthen its share in the Wireless Industry by growing its tablet momentum in the near future.Furthermore, the company has been moderating its churn over the past few quarters, with its improved customer care services and competitive strategies. Besides, the company's wireless customer care services were ranked first amongst its peers in a customer care services study by J.D power. The following graph shows TMUS' postpaid churn in recent quarters.Source: Company's Quarterly Earnings ReportAlthough the company's postpaid subscriber base growth has been fairly strong in 2Q14, net postpaid subscriber additions of 1.4 million by VZ and 1 million by T outpaced TMUS' net postpaid additions of 908,000. I believe the company's postpaid net additions are still strong given its relative size as compared to T and VZ.TMUS has mapped out its plan to stay competitive in the long run with its competitive strategies like equipment installment plan and family plan. As per the new family plan, the company will be offering a four-line family plan with 10GB of data for $100, which is lower than T's plans and those of other major U.S. carriers. I believe this plan will attract a large number of subscribers towards TMUS.Based on the potential of the newly introduced family plan offerings and innovative customer friendly un-carrier strategies, I believe the company will continue to witness a gain in its subscriber base. Also the company is highly likely to achieve its target of branded postpaid net additions of 3 million-to-3.5 million by the end of 2014.Subscribers Growth Translated to Revenue GainSince the company's branded postpaid subscriber base has gained momentum, TMUS has been efficiently translating its subscriber base gain into revenue growth. In 2Q14, the company's total revenue growth was 8% year-on-year, outpacing T and VZ, who reported total revenue growths of only 1.6% and 5.7% year-over-year, respectively.As the company has been undertaking competitive strategies to address competition and grow its subscriber base, its ARPU has been decreasing. In 2Q14, TMUS' postpaid ARPU dropped by 8% to $49.32. I believe that as long as the company is able grow its top-line numbers and subscriber base, a drop in ARPU is not a significant concern for the company. Also, I believe ARPU will improve in the near future, as the company plans to increase its data package prices and eliminate discounts from new customers. TMUS CFO and Executive Vice President J. Braxton Carter said in the 2Q14 earnings conference call:""We believe that recent pricing actions, like the requalification requirements retain corporate discounts, the elimination of corporate discounts from new customers and the increase in the price for 4G unlimited from $70 to $80, will help us achieve our ARPU goal.""The following table shows the year-over-year growth rates of TMUS' branded postpaid service revenue and ARPU.Source: Company's Quarterly Earnings ReportImproving Margin  TMUS' healthy top-line results for 2Q14 and strategic initiatives grew its EBITDA margin by 26%, as compared to 2Q13. The expansion of the EIP program, which offers better margins, was the key driver behind strong EBITDA margin growth. In addition, the company's efficient cost management initiatives also added towards expanding EBITDA margin. Furthermore, the company's MetroPCS integration plan stays on track; up till now, 2/3rd of MetroPCS' customer base has been brought to the TMUS network. Also, the company expects to realize cash synergies of 1.5 billion/year by fully integrating MetroPCS.In addition, the company is aggressively rolling out its LTE network, with improved network breadth and quality. TMUS' 10x10 4G-LTE network, offering high download speeds, is now available in 43 out of the top 50 metro areas. Moreover, in 2Q14, the company started deploying the 700MHZ A-Block spectrum on its network, which will expand its coverage footprint. TMUS is also partnering with multiple parties to speed up its 700MHZ spectrum expansion to approximately 8.7 million POPs.ConclusionTMUS has been growing its postpaid subscriber base with strategic initiatives, which are fueling its top-line growth. Moreover, the company's subscriber base growth seems strong with its commitment to introducing innovative un-carrier strategies and family plan offerings. In addition, the company has been experiencing strong EBITDA margin growth, and the trend is likely to continue, which will portend well for the bottom-line growth. Due to the aforementioned factors, I am bullish on the stock.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

First, Rupert Murdoch withdraws $80 billion bid for Time Warner Cable, and then Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBF) drops its bid to acquire T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS). So, dynamics of the industry are not going to change after all. Sprint (NYSE: S) and T-Mobile will remain distant third and fourth players behind the two giants of the telecom industry. Sprint is abandoning its bid to acquire T-Mobile, and the announcement is expected on Wednesday. Strong regulatory resistance is cited as a reason to abandon the bid. Mr. Son, Softbank's founder, came to a decision over past few weeks that the bid was too risky, according to some sources. The deal had to clear not only antitrust review by the department of justice, but also a public interest vetting by the Federal Communications Commission. Moreover, FCC's intention to block combined spectrum bid was Softbank's cue to back out. So, Softbank did. T-Mobile and Sprint have not ruled out consolidation in future but the deal is not likely to be approved at this time, according to Reuters.This development paves the way for French Iliad to acquire T-Mobile; the original bid was deemed low and rejected by T-Mobile officials. Now as Softbank is out of the scenario, bargaining power is tipped towards Iliad, and Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGF) may not be able to get the price it wants. Iliad is already negotiating with potential partners to sweeten the original $15 billion, or $33/share, deal for 56.6% stake in T-Mobile.From an investment perspective, T-Mobile is still a buy due to its acquisitive potential and subscriber momentum. Softbank news obviously limits the upside that was expected due to the merger or the breakup fee. A revised bid from Iliad may be in the range of $34-$39. Other bidders can also emerge. Moreover, subscriber momentum is going to drive the stock in upward direction. So, the bottom line is that Softbank's decision to abandon the bid limits potential upside in T-Mobile's valuation but the stock is still a buy amid acquisitive potential and subscriber momentum.""Update: T-Mobile Earnings And Acquisition"" anticipated Softbank's decision to back out.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2310085,39231,2014-07-11T03:58:24-04:00,TMUS’ growing subscriber base and increasing smartphone penetration adding to top-line growth.Company is nicely placed amongst its peers through its effective Uncarrier strategies.Increasing smartphone penetration and expected synergies from MetroPCS will positively affect company’s long-term performance.,"I reiterate my bullish thesis on T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). The company has been modestly growing its subscriber matrices given its competitive pricing plans, ETF (early termination fee) and Simple Choice plan. Moreover, the company's top-line and bottom-line results benefited in 1Q14 with its industry leading year-over-year smartphone subscriber growth and synergies attained from the MetroPCS integration. Also, I believe the company's ARPU and EBITDA will benefit from the ongoing growth investments in coming quarters. Furthermore, the Sprint (NYSE:S) and TMUS merger is expected to turn a new corner in the competition in the North American Telecom Sector.Top-Line Success StoryThe North American Wireless Industry is dominated by four major carriers, AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), S and TMUS. On the basis of wireless subscriptions, T-Mobile has been constantly increasing its share of subscription in recent quarters, as shown by the chart below.Source: Statista.comIn this highly saturated Telecom Industry, all carriers have been actively taking pricing initiatives to grow their wireless subscriber base. TMUS' Un-carrier 4.0 ""ETF"" have brought favorable results for the company; TMUS added 1.3 million branded postpaid subscribers in 1Q14. Also in 1Q14, TMUS experienced postpaid additions of 600,000 with its new pricing initiatives, introduced under the More Value Share Plan. On the other hand, VZ extended the reduced monthly pricing for customers enrolled under its EDGE program, but the company only added 539,000 postpaid connections in 1Q14. I believe the acceleration in TMUS subscriber base is due to the strong ETF plan. Moreover, the strong uptake of the ETF plan also enabled the company to outpace its peers with a well-built smartphone subscriber growth in 1Q14, as shown in the chart below.Source: Companies Quarterly Earnings ReportTMUS' Uncarrier strategies have remained key drivers of the company's subscriber growth. The company has recently introduced its Uncarrier 5.0 strategy, which allows customers to take the iPhone5s on a 7-day free trial. I believe with this initiative, TMUS will let customers judge the competitive edge of the company's services over its peers. Also, the strategy will drive more customers towards T-Mobile stores, increasing the company's subscriber base.In addition, to serve the increasing demand of music streaming by mobile users, the company has announced the ""Music Freedom"" program to provide customers with high-speed music streaming with no extra charges. I believe with the recent increase in the number of people who stream music on their phones, TMUS' Music Freedom program will portend well for its subscriber base growth and will allow the company to improve its churn. Although TMUS has been consistently improving its churn; in 1Q14, TMUS' churn rate was 1.5% as compared to 3.3% in the same quarter the previous year. Going forward, as the company remains focused on improving its subscriber base by introducing its Uncarrier strategies, the company's churn will keep on improving.Furthermore, the industry leading subscriber growth of TMUS did well to grow its top line and moderate its ARPU decline. The company ended 1Q14 with a revenue growth of 47% year-over-year, mainly due to the inclusion of MetroPCS' results. The integration of MetroPCS expanded TMUS' presence to 30 new markets. Moreover, the integration of MetroPCS' business will drive the company's top-line growth in coming quarters. On the other hand, the continuous adoption of ETF and the Simple Choice plan, to address competition, will keep ARPU pressurized in the near term. But I believe that as soon as the company completes the migration of customers to the Simple Choice plan, the declining ARPU will start to stabilize. Going forward, the company plans on bringing price changes by increasing the price of its unlimited 4G offers, and the cutting down of unlimited discounts to affinity customers will portend well for ARPU in the future.The LTE Spectrum Race, winners and losersLTE network coverage is a major growth driver for telecom companies. By using the combination of 5MHZ of its 700MHZ spectrum and 20MHZ of its AWS spectrum for LTE, TMUS now covers 230 million POPs. The company faces tough competition from VZ, which now covers 306 million POPs by using 10MHZ of its 700MHZ and 20MHZ of its AWS spectrum for LTE. Moreover, T is also adding to the competition, as it now covers 290 million POPs by using 10MHZ of its 700MHZ and AWS spectrum for LTE. TMUS has sensed the competition heat and is adding density to its spectrum by acquiring new low-band spectrum from small companies to increase its market presence in metropolitan areas.Going forward, by utilizing these newly-acquired spectrums and integrating MetroPCS spectrums, TMUS will witness an increase in terms of POPs covered by its LTE network. Also, TMUS still tops its competitors by delivering the highest 4G-LTE speed, as shown in the chart below.Source: Company's Quarterly Earnings reportT-Mobile and S MergerThere is a lot of speculation in the U.S. Telecom Sector about the TMUS and S merger. I believe there's a lot of upside potential if the merger takes place. If it succeeds, the combined new company will reduce the number of major carriers from four to three, which will boost competition, thereby increasing price wars and shifting the focus of carriers on quality of services. In addition, the combined company will observe an increase in LTE network coverage, as a result of spectrums combination. I believe if this merger takes place, TMUS and S will be in a better position to address the intense competition.ConclusionTMUS is decently moving ahead in the sector. The company's growing subscriber base and increasing smartphone penetration is adding to its top-line growth. I believe the company is nicely placed amongst its peers through its effective Uncarrier strategies. Moreover, increasing smartphone penetration and expected synergies from MetroPCS will positively affect the company's performance in the long term.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2375135,80135,2014-08-03T09:10:46-04:00,"T-Mobile had yet another growth quarter, and the acquisition front is heating up with Iliad's $15 billion bid for 56.6% stake of T-Mobile.I revise my previous opinion regarding the chances of Sprint/T-Mobile merger as new events reveal that the probability of such a merger is remote.Accordingly, the price target is revised to reflect newly anticipated scenarios. The deal block by the FCC can drive T-Mobile in upward direction amid potential breakup fee.","T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS), the fourth largest wireless carrier in the U.S, is in a spectacular turn-around mode, thanks to the price reduction and un-carrier initiatives of the company. The break up fee and the airwaves obtained from AT&T (NYSE: T), back in 2011, enabled this price reduction/un-carrier strategy. The company also posted decent results in second-quarter 2014. Therefore, T-Mobile is an attractive acquisition target. Softbank is planning for Sprint (NYSE: S)/T-Mo merger, while French Iliad has also submitted an offer for T-Mobile. I was quite optimistic about Sprint/T-Mo merger before. However, as the events unfold, it seems that this will be a hard-sell after all. Consequently, in my view, the scenario has changed; either Softbank will pursue the merger and ending up paying a break-up fee, or it will back out to avoid the fee. Earnings highlights along with scenario analysis and its implications follow below.Earning highlightsT-Mobile posted decent results in second-quarter 2014. Revenue grew by 8% Y/Y on a pro forma combined basis. Services revenue grew by 7.1% in the same period. Revenue growth was supported by increase in services revenue due to the growth of the company's subscriber base. Higher equipment sales (think iPhone) also drove the revenue in an upward direction. However, adoption of simple choice plan and some non-recurring charges capped revenue growth to some extent.On EBITDA front, the company posted growth of 14.7% on a year-over-year basis. EBITDA margin improved from 20% to 26% sequentially. Subscriber growth along with lower equipment losses explain the growth of EBITDA.Overall, the un-carrier strategy of the company is consistently paying off by adding to the top line growth.As long as revenue growth through subscriber addition offsets the declining average revenue per user, there should be no red flags for the top line growth of the company. Speaking of which, ARPU of the company is following a downward trend. ARPU fell from $54.04 to $49.32 in a matter of one year. However, excluding the non-recurring factors, branded postpaid phone ARPU would have been $49.93, resulting in a sequential decline of 1% or $0.55. So, un-carrier comes at a cost. The adoption of simple choice plan is affecting the revenue per user of the company.Penetration of simple choice plan that stands at 80% (expected to increase to 85%-90% by year-end) as compared to 75% at the end of first-quarter resulted in lower average revenue per user. However, simple choice plan and other un-carrier initiatives drove subscriber growth at the first place. Subscriber addition is very important, because subscriber gains now will result in higher data revenues later as LTE and VoLTE market matures.As far as subscriber additions are concerned, the company added 1.5 million net subscribers, reflecting successful price reduction strategy of T-Mobile. Breakup of net-adds is as follows:Net additions of T-Mobile are quite impressive as Verizon (NYSE: VZ) added 304,000 net postpaid phone subscribers and Sprint lost 181,000. So, the declining ARPU is not a worrisome factor for T-Mobile as long as it is finding momentum in net additions. Moreover, the churn rate is flat at 1.5%, pointing out that subscribers are satisfied.All in all, this quarter's performance was impressive. Furthermore, the company has upgraded its net addition guidance. For the full year, T-Mobile now expects to add 3.1 million to 3.5 million subscribers as compared to 2.8 million to 3.3 million originally expected. So, T-Mobile is a buy amid subscriber momentum irrespective of any acquisitive development. How much is the appropriate upside though? Different acquisition scenarios should be taken in to account to answer this question.Recent acquisitive developmentsSprint's parent is weighing options to buy T-Mobile for quite some time now. The merger will give Deutsche Telekom a long-awaited exit from the U.S. telecom industry. I was quite optimistic that the deal will go through, but some recent developments point to the contrary.Despite the fact that the above-presented argument can very much be used against any of the two larger players (VZ and T), this should be Softbank's cue to back out if it wants to avoid breakup fee.Recent developments strongly suggest that the chances of Sprint/T-Mo merger are remote and the only question that remains is whether T-Mobile gets the breakup fee or not. Softbank can either back out before an official agreement or it has to pay a breakup fee. Softbank will probably back out, as it can use the financing lined up for a merger, or the potential breakup fee in improving and expanding Sprint's infrastructure. It can also use the funds to buy additional spectrum next year. Anyhow, this boils down to two scenarios. Either Softbank will back out or the FCC will turn down the merger. The only difference will be the breakup fee. The latter is favorable for T-Mobile. Valuation relating to both scenarios follow:ValuationBase assumptionsCase 1: FCC blocks the mergerCash flows are adjusted to reflect the effect of breakup fee, in case the merger is blocked by FCC.The price target is favorable in this scenario, as it reveals a 30% upside in T-Mobile's valuation.Case 2: SoftBank backs outNo breakup fee will be scored by T-Mobile in this scenario. The valuation is adjusted to reflect the absence of breakup fee.Price target reveals that the stock is correctly valued and there is little or no upside going forward.Bottom lineT-Mobile is consistently adding subscribers due to its un-carrier strategy. Subscriber momentum makes T-Mobile a buy, but caution should be exercised, as the cash flow-based price target reveals that the stock is priced correctly. The plan of action for TMUS investors should be to buy and hold until T-Mobile stalls on subscriber growth. Moreover, the investor should closely follow any merger-related news to weigh the options. Why? Because, for instance, the Sprint/T-Mo merger could be beneficial for the investor due to synergy benefits, however, mergers like Iliad will only add to the costs and entail minimum synergies. Moreover, bid price is also a factor why investors should watch out for merger-related news.Here is a link to the previous article ""Merger Or No Merger, T-Mobile Is Poised To Win"".Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

He prolifically tweets disparaging comments about his rivals, and he has no qualms with crashing their events.His throw caution to the wind antics could be seen as unbefitting of a leader of a multibillion dollar company. However, it can't be ignored that he has done a bang up job of attracting new subscribers and giving his chief competitors, especially Verizon (NYSE: VZ), AT&T (NYSE: T) and Sprint (NYE: SS), a run for their money.Being acquired?It's been widely reported that Sprint is in the final stretch of negotiating terms to buy T-Mobile. They are the number three and number four players in the wireless space behind number one Verizon and number two AT&T. They could be more formidable players to compete against the big two if they merge.There is the question of whether or not federal regulators will allow the acquisition to go through. Officials from the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission have made it clear in the past that they want four wireless carriers to rule the space, not three.Is Legere CEO style the new normal?Sprint and T-Mobile are still moving forward, reportedly; even determining that Legere should run the new entity. It seems that his antics are acceptable and may very well be the new norm. Examples of his borderline childish behavior include crashing AT&T's developer party, getting kicked out of it, and then tweeting about it. He is indeed a prolific tweeter, taking to the social media site very often to bash his rivals. Take this Legere tweet, for example, which references when the air conditioning system at the San Antonio's AT&T Center broke during the NBA Finals a few weeks back.Proven resultsWhile Legere's behavior may run afoul of that of a typical CEO, the market hasn't shunned the company's stock. Since Legere began leading the company in 2012, the stock has been steadily climbing. It's gone from trading around $12 a share in July 2102, before Legere came on board, to its current price of about $33 a share.That increase of roughly 187% can't be trumped by the top three carriers. AT&T's stock performance has been the worst. It's down 1.7% since July 2012. Verizon's stock is up just 12.3% during this period. Only Sprint comes close, with an increase of 136% in its stock price.Then there is T-Mobile's subscriber growth. It now has 45 million, which has quickly approached Sprint, which has 54 million subscribers. Still, T-Mobile lags behind leaders Verizon and AT&T by about 50 million subscribers.Bold moves disrupting the spaceThe increase in subscriber growth can be attributed to Legere completely going against the grain when it comes to the wireless carrier space. Termed the ""uncarrier"" approach, T-Mobile's strategy includes everything from getting rid of the lucrative customer contract that used to be the backbone of the industry to paying the termination fees of its rivals' customers to switch to T-Mobile. Also, customers can upgrade their phones within a year of purchasing them instead of having to wait two years or more to do so. This had long stuck in the craw of consumers who are anxious to buy new phones every year. T-Mobile also offers an unlimited data for life for tablets. This flies in the face of other carriers that offer data plans that many consumers deem too expensive.What's next?Even if regulators don't approve the acquisition, Legere's business savvy has still set the company up to come out okay. He was reportedly able to negotiate a $2 billion breakup fee if the deal is not approved or falls through. Sprint, majority-owned by SoftBank, is reportedly ready to fork over $32 billion for the company.Also, Legere is making offers to buy low-band spectrum from smaller rival, according to the New York Post. The newspaper notes that the spectrum, which T-Mobile lacks, is the key to capitalizing in urban markets like New York City because it penetrates buildings better than the high-band variety.While I want to see him dial back the antics a bit, his style may very well be the new norm.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2299745,80135,2014-07-04T09:23:05-04:00,"There is a strong possibility that the FCC will allow the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint corporation.The new-entity that will be formed, as a result, will be able to compete on equal-footing with Verizon and AT&T.T-Mobile and its investors, irrelevant of the outcome of the merger-deal, are in a win/win position.","T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS), a telecom service provider, has been showing an impressive subscriber-growth for several quarters now. This all started when the Federal communications commission turned down AT&T's (NYSE: T) bid to acquire T-Mobile several years ago. The break-up fees and the spectrum acquired from this development helped T-Mobile in improving its network. The fees also helped the company in its ""un-carrier"" price-reduction strategy, responsible for the recent growth of T-mobile's subscriber-base. Recently Softbank, the parent of Sprint corporation (NYSE: S), agreed to acquire T-Mobile for a sum of $32 billion, and hence the future prospects of T-Mobile are starting to look a lot better. The company will benefit from this development whether the deal goes through or not. However, chances of the deal going through are not as slim as perceived by the market.The dealPicture credit: cnet.com and besttechie.comFCC and the department of justice expressed a desire to have at least four network operators. There are already four players in the market, and a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint will reduce this number to three odd players. FCC is skeptical about reducing the number of players and believes that it will lead to unfavorable pricing for the consumer. This weakens the chances of approval for the deal. Despite all the negativity surrounding the deal, Softbank's case seems to be a strong one. Softbank is pitching that three strong operators are a better proposition for the consumer. As Verizon and AT&T are quite ahead, T-Mobile or Sprint alone can't create meaningful competition and the result, effectively, is a two-player industry. Softbank is convinced that a duopoly is not healthy for the market. It resulted in higher prices in the U.S. market. In Japan, the subscriber market-share is distributed more evenly. DoCoMo, Softbank, and KDDI hold around 40%, 30% and 28% of the market share. In contrast, the major portion of the total subscriber-base is held by Verizon and AT&T in the U.S. Furthermore, the larger players are in a position to charge higher rates because capital-constrained smaller players like T-mobile can't compete with them on coverage.Source: Softbank's presentationThe average speeds in the U.S. are also lower due to the lack of motivation to compete. The average download speed of Softbank is around 21.3Mbps, compared to the U.S. average of 6.5Mbps. Hence, Softbank's case is not that weak, and there is a possibility that the FCC will consider the merger-option.Case 1- Deal approvedThe new-entity, T-Mobile and Sprint combined, will emerge as the third largest telecom service provider with almost 100 million subscribers. T-Mobile and Sprint, combined, have the low-band and the high-band spectrum. The low-band spectrum will be useful in stretching the coverage into rural and suburban areas. The high-end spectrum band will be useful to address the capacity issues in the densely populated urban areas. A study from Huawei concludes that the capacity is easier to find in the higher frequency bands, and hence it is suitable for dense areas. The low-band spectrum provides better coverage, and it is suitable for low-cost, wider-coverage implementation. The new-entity will end up with more options in the spectrum-band department, helping it to compete on equal footing with Verizon (NYSE: VZ) and AT&T.Cost benefits will also arise because of the elimination of the duplicate functions. The synergy benefits of this deal can exceed $20 billion, noted Hannes Wittig, an analyst at JP Morgan. The management of Softbank believes that increased access to the airways, better bidding prospects for spectrum, and the improved infrastructure will result from this merger.T-Mobile's investors will receive $40 for each share held, which is a premium to the current stock price. All in all, the approval of the deal will be a win-win for both T-Mobile's investors and the new-entity.Case 2- Deal blockedIf the deal gets blocked; T-Mobile will, nevertheless, end up in the money. T-Mobile will receive a breakup fee of $2 billion. The company can use it to continue its ""un-carrier"" aggressive price-reduction strategy that helped the company steal subscribers from the competition. The funds can also be used to finance the purchase of low-band spectrum in 2015. The acquisition of the low-band spectrum will result in more reliable and wide coverage for T-Mobile, thanks to the superior propagation qualities of the low-band spectrum.T-Mobile is already hedging against any unfavorable outcome of the deal. It is planning to acquire low-band spectrum from several small players. Verizon is the No.1 network of the U.S. because of its low-band spectrum. T-Mobile will improve its network coverage and reliability by acquiring the low-band spectrum. Hence, T-Mobile is not on the losing-side even if the deal is blocked by FCC.T-Mobile Valuation- Case 2 T-Mobile will receive a breakup fee of around $2 billion in case the merger gets blocked. The company can use this instant cash to improve its network and continue its aggressive price-reduction strategy. Anyhow, incorporating the breakup fee into the cash-flow based valuation model drives a price target of $46.90 for TMUS.Source: Focus Equity estimatesI believe that this price target is in line with the growth prospects of T-Mobile, and the stock has the ability to post gains of around 35%-40%. Follow this link to see the detailed valuation along with the assumptions made to drive the price target.Bottom lineThe telecom industry is undergoing a round of consolidation. The merger will increase the competition, resulting in price wars. T-Mobile will benefit regardless of the outcome of the merger. In the case of the approval of the merger, the new-entity will emerge as a strong competitor to Verizon and AT&T. Cost savings and synergy benefits will add to the bottom line of the new entity. However, if FCC blocks the deal, T-Mobile will take the breakup fee to strengthen its spectrum-position. It will also continue to support its ""un-carrier"" strategy. From an investment perspective, T-Mobile is a good investment option because it is positioned in a unique way in this merger scenario.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2265253,52612,2014-06-12T05:26:00-04:00,Combining Sprint and T-Mobile only makes the merged entity a more able competitor and poses no antitrust concerns.Both AT&T and Verizon have merged their way to becoming leaders in the wireless industry.Consolidations between smaller and bigger companies are how the wireless industry works.,"The merger arbitrage spread on T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) shares has surprisingly widened as of late, with the stock price moving away from the said deal price of about $40 a share, indicating market concern that the proposed purchase of T-Mobile by Sprint (NYSE:S) may face serious antitrust challenges by regulators. However, if the deal does clear of government scrutiny and win their approval, which is argued as such here, at recent prices of below $34, arbitrage traders who have bought the shares could make a fat profit, a potentially near 20 percent return till a supposed deal announcement in a few months. While seeking a larger spread may sound prudent, worries over a potential deal collapse by some traders may prove to be unnecessary.Unlike the earlier failed attempt to acquire T-Mobile by AT&T (NYSE:T), which would have created a mega-cap telecommunication giant, possibly even surpassing Verizon in market capitalization, a successful sale of T-Mobile to Sprint will form a combined entity likely just a third the size of AT&T and in an even smaller proportion to Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Thus, it's difficult to argue that combining Sprint and T-Mobile will trigger some genuine monopoly concerns and warrant an antitrust investigation, given the much larger market presence of AT&T and Verizon. To the contrary, even with the addition of T-Mobile, will Sprint finally become an able competitor to the two industry leaders?For years, Sprint has been a distant third to AT&T and Verizon. Exiting the local landline telephone business probably didn't help Sprint when it came to leveraging economy of scale, considering that the better-performing AT&T and Verizon have found their way of managing both the wireless and landline business. Sprint traces its origins to a Kansas telephone company founded in 1899, but after spinning off its landline assets in 2006, Sprint became better known as a wireless player, forfeiting new landline opportunities in wired Internet. Even after the major addition of Nextel's wireless business, the Sprint name has gone only so far. The change of a large portion of the company's ownership to Softbank hasn't fundamentally altered Sprint's relatively weak position in the U.S. wireless market.The cash infusion from issuing new shares to Softbank, part of the ownership-change arrangement, probably is what can really help Sprint in catching up to its stronger competitors. Without available investment capital, it'd be very challenging for Sprint to acquire other wireless assets and expand its operating capacity. Deals such as the company's cash purchase of its not-yet-owned shares of Clearwire, a growing wireless broadband operator, are something that will drive up Sprint's competitive capability. But AT&T and Verizon have been far more aggressive when it comes to consolidating their market positions, as both companies have scooped up numerous smaller wireless players along the way.AT&T's wireless operation today is far from that under the old AT&T Wireless, which has seen its initial merger with Cingular Wireless, later acquisitions of Cellular One, Centennial, NextWave, the Altel brand and the latest $1.2 billion purchase of Leap Wireless. In a way, that's partly how large wireless carriers can grow their business more effectively, and it hasn't been much different in how Verizon Wireless has come to its current, dominant existence.It's well known that Verizon Wireless started as a joint venture between Bell Atlantic, the predecessor of Verizon Communications, and the UK-based Vodafone, with the two companies contributing their respective U.S. wireless assets: Bell Atlantic Mobile and AirTouch Paging. But the initial venture has gone on with a lot more undertaking to buy other regional wireless players en route to becoming the largest wireless operator in the U.S. today. First, the venture added GTE Wireless soon after its initial operation when Bell Atlantic and GTE merged to become Verizon Communications. Then, over the years Verizon Wireless acquired West Virginia Wireless, Rural Cellular, Ramcell in Oregon and SureWest's wireless operation, among others, all smaller players and divested wireless assets by competitors in some pockets of the wireless market.Consolidation has seemingly become a business pattern in the success of AT&T and Verizon, and will be followed as an industry-wide model by other companies like Sprint. It's fair to say that in wireless communications, companies both build and buy their way to becoming more competitive in the field. As market leaders, AT&T and Verizon can offer customers more comprehensive services, but small companies may pick up certain segments of the market left underserved. For example, MetroPCS for years had simpler calling plans better suited for starting cell-phone users. When T-Mobile had the resources to further build its wireless capacity, the easy way to do was to buy up MetroPCS, whose smaller size was a right complement for T-Mobile, and the consolidation also benefited MetroPCS. As much as small wireless companies can fill some market voids, they generally have limited growth prospects because of lacking sufficient capital for continued infrastructure investments.Smaller wireless carriers come and go as a result of both their ability to meet certain unmet consumer demands early on and their becoming targets later in continued market consolidations. At their respective level of market capitalization, neither Sprint nor T-Mobile alone can take on AT&T and Verizon on all fronts. It's only logical that by consolidating their market holdings, Sprint and T-Mobile can move up the industry ladder and make the entire wireless business more competitive. The continual emerging of small, local wireless carriers and ongoing market consolidations by bigger companies are what actually is at work in the wireless communications market. Combining Sprint and T-Mobile is just another attempt in wireless consolidations.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2264733,23479,2014-06-11T20:58:09-04:00,"Sprint, T-Mobile have reached tentative acquisition deal, according to reports.Under preliminary terms of the reported deal, Sprint is likely to pay around $40 per share for T-Mobile, valuing the company’s equity at close to $32 billion.Sprint would also assume T-Mobile’s net debt of about $9 billion, adding to its ever-burgeoning debt load, which at the end of Q1 2014 was $26.6 billion.","Following intense speculation surrounding the potential of Sprint (NYSE:S) acquiring rival T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) for the last six months, the two companies appear to have reached a tentative deal, according to media reports. (Sprint, T-Mobile Said Near Price, Termination Fee Accord, Bloomberg, June 6, 2014) Under preliminary terms of the reported deal, Sprint is likely to pay around $40 per share for T-Mobile, valuing the company’s equity at close to $32 billion. Sprint would also assume T-Mobile’s net debt of about $9 billion, adding to its ever-burgeoning debt load, which at the end of Q1 2014 was $26.6 billion.Both companies were wary of the FCC blocking the merger earlier, considering the potential anti-competitive nature of the deal. However, recent revisions in spectrum auction rules and debates over net neutrality at the FCC seem to have found favor with both companies, which is likely to have encouraged them to go ahead with the merger. The industry’s shift towards consolidation, witnessed recently with Time Warner merging with Comcast and AT&T‘s (NYSE:T) plans to acquire DirecTV (NYSE:DTV), is also likely to have given confidence to Sprint and its Tokyo-based majority owner SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY) to pursue the deal.If the deal goes through and is approved by regulators, the Sprint-T-Mobile entity would have a share of about 30% of the U.S. wireless market. This would enable it to better compete with market leaders Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T, although consumers would then have one less service provider to choose from. However, if the deal falls through for any reason, Sprint could end up paying over $1 billion in cash as break-up fee to its smaller rival.Our price estimate for Sprint is about $8.50, which is slightly below the current market price.Regulatory ConcernsSprint’s efforts at a deal could face tough opposition from antitrust regulators, who might fret over having one less national carrier and therefore less competition in the industry. Two years ago, a similar bid for T-Mobile by AT&T was abandoned due to anti-competitive concerns from the FCC as well as the Justice Department. However, a merger of the third and fourth largest wireless carriers may not evoke regulatory skepticism of a similar kind.T-Mobile has recently shown signs of turning the corner, with back-to-back quarters of subscriber gains after nearly four years of sustained losses. In the last quarter, the carrier added 2.4 million subscribers, twice as many as the other major carriers combined (though that was driven by a subscriber loss at Sprint). This can attributed to the company’s aggressive ""Uncarrier"" campaign and its deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to carry the iPhone last year. T-Mobile has also raced ahead of Sprint in LTE coverage despite beginning its network deployment much later, which has accelerated Sprint’s postpaid losses in recent quarters. With T-Mobile regaining its footing, antitrust authorities may see the deal as Sprint’s attempt to take out a competitor that is starting to be disruptive to its plans.Complexity In Network IntegrationAlthough the deal appears to be a simple joining of forces between the third and fourth largest wireless operators in the country, the technological differences between their networks could make the integration a complex task to conquer. This is likely to be made all the more complicated by the fact that Sprint is currently undertaking an expensive network modernization drive of its own that includes the integration of Clearwire’s (CLWR) spectrum.Sprint currently provides CDMA/FDD-LTE services on 800 MHz and 1900 MHz spectrum, and is building out a faster TD-LTE network using Clearwire’s 2.5 GHz spectrum. Meanwhile, T-Mobile is using the 1700 MHz AWS band for LTE and 1900 MHz for GSM/HSPA+ services. It is also migrating MetroPCS subscribers from CDMA to its HSPA+ and FDD-LTE networks. The only frequency band that the two carriers have in common is 1900MHz, on which one is running CDMA/FDD-LTE and the other a GSM/HSPA+ network. Acquiring T-Mobile will require Sprint to perform the complicated task of shutting down one of these networks while transitioning subscribers to the other. For the combined LTE network, Sprint will have a tough time deciding what to do with T-Mobile’s AWS band given that it is already investing a lot of resources into building out its 800MHz/1900MHz/2.5GHz LTE network. Carrier aggregation may be the answer, but securing handsets that can access all the different bands could be a tough task.Disclosure: No positions."

Rumors indicate that T-Mobile will be acquired for $32 billion, and it will be announced sometime in July. Following the announcement of the acquisition, an uphill battle of winning support from regulators will continue.Sprint will have to present various economic models, forecasts, data usage trends, etc., to convince regulators. Furthermore, a larger PR campaign will most likely take place in an attempt to win the U.S. public's best interest.The competitive landscape may become more balanced in the United States if T-Mobile and Sprint merge. While regulators like the idea of four telecoms, it's more likely that a trio of telecom companies will allow for reasonable network scale and pricing. However, AT&T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will not want this merger to go through as it will put Sprint in a more flexible position to compete.The regulatory environment has eased on bigger acquisitionsDirecTV could be acquired by AT&T (NYSE:T) for an acquisition value of approximately $48.5 billion, pending regulatory approval. Furthermore, the Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (CMCSK) acquisition of Time Warner Cable (TWC) valued at $45.2 billion paired with some divestitures in overlapping markets may give regulators a valid enough reason to green light the buyout. The overall trajectory in the United States telecom space is further consolidation. Furthermore, many in the media agree that both the Time Warner Cable and DirecTV deals will go through the FCC and DOJ without much hassle.I think that if these two mergers can go through, Sprint may stand a reasonable chance at acquiring T-Mobile. There's plenty of evidence indicating that both Sprint and T-Mobile are outclassed.Source: Washington Post, via Moffett NathansonIf T-Mobile and Sprint were combined, the wireless market share would total 30%. This level of market share would allow T-Mobile and Sprint to operate a network that can support an even bigger 4G LTE rollout. Average 4G network speeds in the United States lag when compared to other emerging and developed markets, which indicates that the United States infrastructure spend is more about profit maximization rather than about operating the market at equilibrium, or at a point of reasonable economic profit. A better capitalized competitor may allow for the market to price itself closer to the equilibrium point.Source: Economics OnlineUsing a standard economic model for an Oligopoly, it's likely that Verizon and AT&T operate their services at P and Q, rather than P1 and Q1. In this specific case, price is greater than marginal cost, indicating that both AT&T and Verizon are earning profit even on the lowest-priced mobile plans and packages. I can confirm this is the case because both AT&T and Verizon have significantly higher average revenue per user figures when compared to average cost per user figures.However, in some cases, firms operate at the intersection of ATC (average total cost) and AR (average revenue i.e., demand curve). This is the breakeven point, which is where Sprint and T-Mobile are at.Source: YchartsSprint and T-Mobile can't invest much into capital expenditure because the amount of revenue conversion to profit is rather abysmal. Both T-Mobile and Sprint have negative free cash flow, which indicates the two mobile companies are operating either at economic breakeven, or loss.Source: YChartsThe combined CAPEX spending of T-Mobile and Sprint would total $7.295 billion. This is less than half the CAPEX spending of Verizon or AT&T.Furthermore, AT&T and Verizon have sustained this differential in Capex spending for the past five years. Sprint and T-Mobile operate vastly inferior 4G LTE networks, and it's likely that unless something changes soon, the mobile telecom space will eventually turn into a two-legged horse race.Source: YChartsTo stay relevant, T-Mobile did offer lower pricing on mobile plans, but the subscriber additions have been very minimal, and the impact on sales for both Verizon and AT&T isn't likely to be sustained. This is because consumers haven't really demonstrated any sustained interest in staying on T-Mobile's network due to quality issues. Also, the loss of mobile subscribers for both AT&T and Verizon barely results in a blip on trailing twelve month sales.Verizon and AT&T also operate a fiber to the premises network, meaning Capex spend is mixed between broadband and mobile networks. This doesn't necessarily ease the competitive pressures facing Sprint and T-Mobile. Mobile product bundling with broadband may allow AT&T and Verizon to exhibit greater economies of scale and further flexibility to price their services at a lower level, and retain similar levels of profitability in certain wireless markets throughout the United States.So what does Masayoshi Son plan to do?SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY) can divest some of its financial interest in Alibaba (ABABA) and invest more of that into the United States telecom market. As you have seen in previous charts, both T-Mobile and Sprint operate at negative free cash flow, which means CAPEX spend is being funded through debt, retained cash or through some other means.Source: SoftBankFurthermore, the United States has some of the highest ARPU figures in the world, indicating that the wireless market can be disrupted with lower levels of pricing. However, to be fair, the United States has a geographic area significantly larger than many of the European and Asian developed markets. This indicates that the differential in revenue per user is contingent on the cost structure of a specific market.Source: SoftBankAs you can tell, the amount of mobile deployment in the United States is lower when compared to other emerging markets that have a similar geographic area. Furthermore, China Mobile has a lower ARPU figure when compared to Verizon. This reiterates the truth about the United States telecom market being priced at the point at which price elasticity can be maximized, rather than at a point where the greatest number of U.S. citizens can own a smartphone.This gives Masayoshi Son enough flexibility to build out a competitive network and lower pricing on mobile plans at the same exact time. With an equal number of mobile subscribers, T-Mobile and Sprint may be able to catch up, assuming SoftBank frees up cash flow from its Japanese operation, and invests that into United States network build out.Source: SoftBankBetween Japanese mobile communications and Sprint, SoftBank invests $11.15 billion into capital expenditures (using current exchange rates). The combined entity (including T-Mobile) will invest $15 billion-plus into mobile network capital expenditures.Softbank has a lot of financial flexibility because it can allocate some of the Capex spending from its Japanese network into the Sprint Spark network. Furthermore, the company can use cash from Japanese operating activities to pay down debt, while continuing the network build out of its vastly inferior U.S. telecom network. SoftBank's Japanese mobile business is extremely healthy (high mobile subscriber additions), along with having high data speeds.When combining the Capex of SoftBank, T-Mobile and Sprint, the spending is only comparable to Verizon's Capex. This is because Verizon and AT&T have higher ARPUs and tend to increase pricing over time, whereas SoftBank has decreased its pricing on plans in Japan. However, SoftBank is loaded with financial assets, like Yahoo Japan and Alibaba. SoftBank has ample liquid assets to cover any short-term deficiency in solvency and flexibility when it comes to capital allocation. Furthermore, upon the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint, cost efficiencies can be used to improve profitability, which leaves a higher amount of income for capital intensive network build out.ConclusionSoftBank may have a solid case for the FCC and DOJ. Without added scale, there's just not enough net income for the needed CAPEX to make for a competitive alternative network. Furthermore, SoftBank has demonstrated that having three competitors in a market place can lead to lower pricing.Assuming Sprint's capital expenditure spending can reach $10-15 billion annually, Sprint's 4G LTE network may reach similar data speeds to Verizon and AT&T. However, a T-Mobile acquisition is more like playing catch-up. AT&T and Verizon will have the upper hand (they're pretty much done with network build out).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Sprint and T-Mobile argue that the US wireless market is a near-duopoly dominated by AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) with a combined market share of approximately 61%. Sprint and T-Mobile have approximately 18% and 12% market share, respectively, and the remaining 9% of the market is split between approximately 100 smaller carriers. The argument is that by combining, Sprint/T-Mobile would have economies of scale needed to more effectively compete with AT&T and Verizon. They argue the significant synergies ($1.5 to $2.0 billion annually) would allow them to offer higher speed data and other advanced services and/or reduce prices in ways they otherwise could not afford.Many market legal observers are understandably skeptical the FCC will accept this argument (Note: communications industry mergers require both DoJ and FCC approval, but FCC approval is generally considered harder. This because the FCC has a more nuanced ""public interest"" standard for approving a merger). In particular, a merger that involved a reduction from four major participants to three is often hard for regulators to accept. This is particularly under Democratic administrations and for mergers involving consumer services.DISH to the Rescue?DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) may offer the solution assuming the FCC would like to see more competition to AT&T and Verizon, but is concerned about a reduction to three major competitors in the wireless industry. DISH, or someone working with them, is probably the only viable new entrant in the mature US wireless industry. DISH has 14 million existing customers they are billing. They already have relationships with critical retail distribution channels and hardware manufacturers. And DISH has approximately 55 MHz of spectrum nationally. Moreover, the DBS industry is seeing its subscriber base shrink because it lacks a broadband option that a wireless service might offer.It's also clear the FCC would like to see DISH as a new entrant to the wireless industry. The FCC has bent over backwards to give DISH terrestrial use of the AWS-4 spectrum at no additional cost, and then an option to convert all of it to downlink if they bid for the H-Block spectrum (an auction that more resembles a negotiated bid than an actual auction).Despite these advantages, DISH appears hesitant to enter the highly competitive wireless market. But what if Sprint/T-Mobile threw DISH a lifeline to enter the market in order to get approval for their own merger? Sprint/T-Mobile could offer DISH preferred roaming rates on their networks until DISH completed its network rollout, sharing of other facilities for a similar period, ensure that phones built for Sprint/T-Mobile also worked on DISH's frequencies and a host of other benefits to facilitate DISH as a rapid new entrant. The prospect of DISH as a strong rapid new entrant to maintain four major players just might be enough to convince the FCC to allow the Sprint/T-Mobile merger.The obvious question is whether supporting a new entrant is too much for Sprint/T-Mobile to offer to get a merger approved? With synergies of roughly $1.5 to $2.0 billion annually, they would be motivated to make some significant concessions. Also, if DISH decides to enter later without these advantages, perhaps motivated by a desire to offer broadband to stem subscriber losses, they may need to enter aggressively with very low prices. Thus, from a Sprint/T-Mobile perspective, it might be better to support DISH's entry in an orderly fashion sooner, rather than risking a highly aggressive ""scorch the earth"" entry a year or two later.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company has been working aggressively to counter tough competition within the industry and strengthen its performance. The company recently reported mixed results for 1Q2014. TMUS's increasing smartphone penetration and synergies from MetroPCS remain among the important earnings growth drivers. Also, growth initiatives like ETF and no contract plan have been helping the company strengthen its subscriber base; TMUS experienced postpaid phone net additions of 1.265 million in 1Q2014. However, the company's margins and ARPU were negatively affected, as the company continues to offer competitive rates (adoption of value/simple choice plans) to counter competition and strengthen subscriber base.Moving AheadThe U.S. Telecom Industry has been facing intense competition and has a highly saturated wireless markets, which limits the growth potential. The telecom market, mainly postpaid market, is dominated by Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) , which limits TMUS's growth potential. However, the company does have the potential to expand and strengthen its prepaid business, and seems to be on track to benefit from the growth potential.With the MetroPCS acquisition, TMUS has strengthened its position in the U.S. industry. It will help the company increase its revenues and also benefit from expected future synergies. TMUS expects to realize total synergies of $6-$7 billion from the acquisition of MetroPCS, which would be derived through the integration of the MetroPCS network. The company was able to report a total revenue increase of 47% year-on-year in 1Q2014, mainly due to the inclusion of full quarter results of MetroPCS. In the last quarter, 53% of MetroPCS customer base migrated to TMUS compatible handsets. I believe TMUS's top line numbers for 2014 will stay strong since it has a lot to offer through the expansion of its consumer choice plans via strong MetroPCS integration ties.The MetroPCS deal was not the only revenue growth driver for the company in the last quarter; higher smartphone sales also contributed towards the growth, as the adjusted revenue grew by 15% year-on-year in the quarter. The company has been on track with its increasing smartphone penetration, which will expand its subscriber base and strengthen its position in the industry. The company has successfully increased its smartphone penetration to approximately 80% in 1Q2014, up from 65% in 1Q2013. The following chart shows the increasing smartphone penetration trend for the company in recent quarters.Source: Company's Quarterly Earnings DataMargin Contraction and Growing Subscriber BaseThe company has been taking measures to cater to the intense price war in the telecom sector. TMUS, with its value/simple choice plan, is offering more services with no extra charges. Also, the company's simple starter plan has started giving a tough time to T's entry-level plan by offering more data than T's 300MB, with no more extra charges. The initiatives taken by the company to address the price seem to benefiting the company's customer base; however, this will put pressure on margins, cash flows and ARPU. In 1Q2014, branded postpaid ARPU dropped by 7.5% year-on-year to $50.01 and EBITDA margin contracted by approximately 200bps.The company drove its postpaid subscriber base better than the entire U.S wireless carrier in 1Q14 with ""un-carrier 4.0"" ETF reimbursement offer for switchers and no-contract plans. I believe in the ETF plan's strength of growing TMUS's subscriber base, yielding a long term stabilized earning base, thereby moderating/supporting margins. Also, I believe the tablet strategies of market leaders like T and VZ, for postpaid customer additions, are highly challenged by TMUS's ETF plan. The following chart shows the postpaid phone additions in 1Q2014 for TMUS, T, VZ and Sprint (NYSE:S).Source: Company's Quarterly Earnings DataOther than postpaid phone net additions, the company has been doing well to expand its branded postpaid net additions and improving the branded postpaid churn rate.Source: Company's Quarterly Earnings Report ConclusionThe company is among the leading telecom companies in the industry. TMUS has substantial prepaid operations, further strengthened by the recent acquisition of MetroPCS. TMUS has been opting for aggressive strategies to counter competition. Healthy subscriber additions and improving churn rate are likely to continue in the near future, as a result of TMUS's unlimited data plan, cheaper value plans, the ETF reimbursement deal, the JUMP early-upgrade plan and free global roaming. These initiatives might put pressures on the company's margins and ARPU, but remain growth drivers for the future. Also, expected synergies from the MetroPCS acquisition and increasing smartphone penetration will benefit the company's future performance.

2124943,23393,2014-04-03T15:26:22-04:00,"TMUS's efforts to win subscribers have worsened margin contraction.Questions about stickiness of new subscribers, given importance of network quality.Combination of S and TMUS makes sense, but regulatory hurdles.Telecom industry rewards those who spend on building out their networks.","Un-carrier? Try unsustainable and unprofitable.The massive loss T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported this week hasn't slowed the hyperactive tweeting of its CEO John Legere. Nor, apparently, has the news scared off his groupies on Wall Street, though that may have more to do with continuing takeover speculation.The numbers reported, however, clearly call into question the sustainability of the company's aggressive marketing strategy. Spin the results any way you want - and several Wall Street supporters are certainly taking their liberties. But it's hard for any objective observer to be sanguine.True, T-Mobile US grew its customer base by an outwardly impressive 1.645 million users in the last three months of 2013. And unlike in previous quarters, most weren't low-margin prepaid customers. It's also unclear, however, just what sort of users these new additions will be, as the company has done away with contracts.Will these ""branded postpaid net additions"" prove as sticky as contract customers historically have been? Or will the company start to see its customer loss or churn rate accelerate from the current 1.7 percent annualized rate, which is still 70 basis points above churn rates for AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ).The answer likely boils down to network reliability and quality. But without the cushion of contracts, there's not a lot to stop T-Mobile US users from moving on if they're dissatisfied.Customer additions also came at a very high cost. Total revenue in fourth quarter 2013 was robust, rising 10.2 percent after taking into account the acquisition of MetroPCS. Smartphone sales hit a record 6.2 million units, or 91 percent of total phones sold. That suggests rising use of high-speed data, which is the key to improved margins.T-Mobile US, however, experienced the polar opposite in its fourth quarter. Mainly, the combined services revenue of the company and MetroPCS was actually 1.1 percent lower than in the year-ago quarter.The combined company's branded postpaid average revenue per user fell by 2.9 percent, the consequence of offering so many discount plans for service. Cost per new customer rose by $10 during the quarter to $317.As a result, T-Mobile US's fourth-quarter cash flow - again after leaving out non-recurring items - dropped 7.8 percent from the third quarter.In contrast to its sector rivals, the company did not include financial statements with its earnings release. The Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, however, has plenty more disturbing news.Front and center is a collapse in operating margins. Excluding $8.134 billion in impairment charges in 2012, the company had $17.832 billion in total operating expenses that year. This figure was $23.424 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.In 2012, T-Mobile US posted operating margins of 9.6 percent; this figure shrank to 4.1 percent in 2013.Moving further down the income statement, combining interest expense to affiliates -- Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) -- and interest, presumably paid to outside investors, yields a total of $1.223 billion, nearly twice the prior year's $661 billion.That figure is certain to rise further in 2014. Management has announced capital spending plans of $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion in cash, versus projections of cash flow before cash interest and taxes of $5.7 billion to $6 billion. Even leaving out taxes, cash interest alone will consume the difference.That, in turn, means more debt. In 2013, for example, T-Mobile US issued $2.494 billion in bonds, versus a total of $324 million in repayments. That was despite a $1.787-billion stock offering.Of course, even elevated capital spending won't come anywhere close to keeping up with AT&T and Verizon Communications. Both have announced capital spending plans in the neighborhood of the numbers they ran up last year, which I show in the table, ""Spend to Dominate."" That's better than a 4-to-1 spending advantage for Verizon Communications and a nearly 5-to-1 margin for AT&T.As for the bottom line, net income dropped by nearly 90 percent in 2013 (leaving aside the one-time impairment charge). That's a shortfall for which the bulls have already forgiven the company. But it's red ink that's likely to keep spilling in 2014, given that the fourth quarter was the third consecutive reporting period in which T-Mobile US has suffered a loss.Exit StrategyPerhaps the company will find a way to restore margins while competing on price with industry leaders. Its leading shareholder, however, hardly seems convinced.Two years ago, Deutsche Telekom was thwarted in its attempt to sell T-Mobile US to AT&T for US$39 billion. After a 55 percent-plus gain in the stock over the past 12 months, T-Mobile US's market capitalization is back to $24.5 billion, which puts the market value of Deutsche Telekom's 66.71 percent equity interest at $16.34 billion.The German giant unloaded 535,000-plus shares on Dec. 31, 2013. In fact, insider sales have been fast and furious over the past 12 months, starting from a share price in the low $20s.Deutsche Telekom's apparent quest for a sale is almost certainly the biggest reason so many on Wall Street are still sticking around: 15 analysts rate the stock a buy, versus 11 holds and one sell. And a much-rumored bid from No. 3 US wireless company, Sprint Corp. (NYSE:S) would make a lot of sense.The combination of these two companies would face some challenges, particularly when it comes to integrating networks and brands. But even assuming some attrition, the combined subscriber base of nearly 100 million would be comparable to AT&T and Verizon.The company would also have more than 50 million postpaid subscribers, much closer to Verizon Communications' 95 million and AT&T's 70 million-plus -- though T-Mobile US's tearing up of contracts adds uncertainty to its numbers.More important, the two companies' combined capital spending in 2013 was $10.858 billion. Pooling efforts would no doubt create considerable synergies, quite possibly closing the spending gap even more with the industry's big dogs.Deutsche Telekom would demand an all-cash exit. But at a much more solid No. 3 in a growing market, Sprint/T-Mobile would quite possibly enjoy far more favorable access to the capital markets. And SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY), which owns 80 percent of Sprint, has reportedly lined up banks to finance a deal. That's a pretty good indication the parties are ready and willing to make a move.But would regulators sign off on the merger? Predictably, the US Dept of Justice and Federal Communications Commission have emerged as major hurdles to doing any deal.Both agencies have frequently decried the increasing concentration of wireless industry power and profit under AT&T and Verizon Communications. But like their counterparts in Europe, they've bought into conventional wisdom that it must preserve four national competitors as some kind of magic number. And T-Mobile USA's fourth-quarter customer growth has only dug them in further.Both AT&T and Verizon Communications picked up customers in the fourth quarter. And they did it while cutting debt, boosting profit margins and reducing their defection rates.Learn more about my favorite telecom names in Top Essential-Services Stocks for 2014.Disclosure: I am long VZ, T.

2240733,24849,2014-05-28T06:43:20-04:00,"Sprint needs to get a T-Mobile deal done.In Q1, Sprint lost subs and ARPU declined.""Framily"" plan for 4 people doesn't seem competitive.The company is still losing money, and debt remains high.","We've heard a lot of talk recently about Sprint (NYSE:S) making a move for T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). The #3 and #4 US wireless carriers need to band together, as some speculate that one will disappear if they try to battle on their own. As a bitter price war continues, these two names cannot compete with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) on their own. For those that don't believe a deal is coming soon, Sprint may provide a potential short opportunity. Today, I'll detail why.""Framily"" plan - not competitive for 4 people:Even if you only watch a small amount of television, you've probably seen a ton of commercials for these four wireless carriers. Sprint keeps pushing its ""Framily"" plan, commercials highlighted by a family led by a hamster. Some of Sprint's commercials also feature NBA superstar Kevin Durant and NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon. You've probably seen AT&T's commercials with salesperson Lily, and perhaps former NBA player Grant Hill. Some of these commercials were funny or cute the first couple of times, but when you see them dozens of times a week, they get rather annoying.Anyway, Sprint's Framily plan offers a low monthly rate if you can get a large group of people together. The plan offers unlimited talk and text, plus a GB of data per line, and the price drops as you get more people, as you can see in the graphic below.(Source: Sprint website)For a family of four, Sprint's plan is not competitive. The same $160 Sprint plan costs just $100 with T-Mobile. Additionally, for the same four phones, Verizon and AT&T offer more data than Sprint does. You can see a number of comparisons from Consumer Reports in this article. For example, AT&T offers a $160 plan for four that offers 10GB of data between the four phones. Sprint needs to be more competitive here, and that means driving down prices further.Losing subscribers and ARPU:If you look at the opening of Sprint's Q1 earnings press release, you don't see any information about subscriber growth or revenues per user. Sprint reported a loss of 383 thousand subs on the Sprint platform, and a total loss of 467 thousand wireless subs. Churn rates were also higher than the Q4 2013 and Q1 2013 levels. Perhaps just as negative was the report on average revenues per user. The chart below, taken from the above press release, worries me a bit.Note ""a"" - ""We (Sprint) acquired approximately 352,000 postpaid subscribers and 59,000 prepaid subscribers through the acquisition of assets from U.S. Cellular when the transaction closed on May 17, 2013. We acquired approximately 788,000 postpaid subscribers, 721,000 prepaid subscribers, 93,000 wholesale subscribers and transferred 29,000 Sprint wholesale subscribers that were originally recognized through our Clearwire MVNO arrangement to Transactions postpaid subscribers as a result of the Clearwire acquisition when the transaction closed on July 9, 2013.""Note ""b"" - ""ARPU is calculated by dividing service revenue by the sum of the average number of subscribers in the applicable service category. Changes in average monthly service revenue reflect subscribers for either the postpaid or prepaid service category who change rate plans, the level of voice and data usage, the amount of service credits which are offered to subscribers, plus the net effect of average monthly revenue generated by new subscribers and deactivating subscribers.""Not only did Sprint lose subscribers in Q1, but the average revenue per subscriber dipped a bit as well. With these ""Framily"" and other plans that go as low as $25, the average is likely to head lower. Don't forget, if Sprint loses a $75-a-month sub, the company needs to add three $25-a-month subs just to make up the revenue shortfall. If current Sprint customers trade down to cheaper plans, these numbers will continue to decline. With a price war continuing, I don't see how Sprint's ARPU numbers will rise anytime soon. Unless Sprint starts to generate meaningful subscriber growth, revenues will be stagnant for quite some time.Declining revenues, more losses, high debt:During Q1, Sprint reported revenues of $8.875 billion. That was down about $267 million sequentially from Q4 2013, and current estimates show more sequential declines coming. If the company's plans are not competitive, subscriber losses will continue. If you combine declining subscribers and declining average revenues per subscriber, the total revenues will not head in the right direction. Additionally, Reuters recently reported that T-Mobile had passed Sprint as the #3 smartphone buyer in the US during Q1. Reuters states that T-Mobile's aggressive pricing is working, while a market researcher stated that ""Sprint doesn't have that much demand to sell into"". Neil Shah, an analyst at Counterpoint Technology Market Research, believes that Sprint will have to up its strategy.On the flip side, Sprint's losses have come down, but the company is still losing money. Estimates don't call for the company to be profitable this year or next, and if Sprint needs to be more aggressive with discounting, losses could accelerate. This isn't a short-term issue for Sprint, as losses have been in the billions for a number of years.At the same time, the balance sheet continues to get weaker, and the company has to spend mightily to upgrade its network that is behind industry peers. Sprint had negative free cash flow of more than $1 billion in Q1, and about $4 billion in the past six months. Net debt rose by more than $1 billion in Q1, and now stands at more than $26.5 billion. With the company targeting capital expenditures of roughly $8 billion in 2014, negative free cash flow will continue for the indefinite future. In the next couple of years, billions in debt start to come due.What's the trade here?Sprint is a risky investment in the sense that you are betting solely on a share price rise. The company does not have a dividend, so investors get no income or level of safety. Verizon offers an annual dividend yield near 4.3%, with AT&T above 5.2%. Those names are also not as volatile as Sprint, so you won't see shares drop 30% in a short period of time.Sprint could be in trouble if it remains solo, as T-Mobile continues to grab subscribers in a big way. However, every time these rumors pop up about Sprint buying T-Mobile, Sprint shares rise. Sprint is at the higher end of its yearly range, as you can see in the chart below.(Source: Yahoo Finance)In late April, Sprint shares dropped to a low of $7.38, a large fall from the $11.47 high reached in late December 2013. If T-Mobile continues to steal subs, Sprint results might come in poor over the next quarter or two. An interesting trade currently might be to short the stock and sell out-of-the-money puts (maybe $9 strike for November 2014). In this trade, you make money to a point as Sprint shares go down, but you also hedge yourself a bit should shares rise in price. Right now, you could sell the November $9s for $1.10 each.Now, there was some interesting options activity recently that leads some to believe Sprint shares will spike. A large number of June $11 calls were bought last week, prompting some to believe Sprint shares are about to spike. For this reason, I do believe it might be wise to see if Sprint rises to the $10 to $11 range over the next few weeks, then execute a short sale and an associated options trade. Perhaps if we get another T-Mobile rumor spike, that will be your chance to execute this trade.Final thoughts:Sprint may need T-Mobile now more than ever. T-Mobile seems to be stealing market share with its aggressive pricing, while Sprint lost subscribers in Q1 this year. Sprint's Framily plan for four people doesn't stack up, and lower revenue subs could take away from total revenues. The company continues to lose money and burn through cash. With shares over $9, a short opportunity does exist, but I'd prefer investors wait for a little more pop before shorting. I also think selling puts may be a good idea. If Sprint cannot get a T-Mobile deal done rather soon, investors will focus again on Sprint's results, which lately have not been great.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2086873,56922,2014-03-13T13:11:48-04:00,TMUS experienced subscriber growth in the recent past thanks to its “un-carrier” strategy.TMUS has posted revenue growth of around 24% this quarter.The foray into LTE can be a game changer for the company.,"T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is a U.S. wireless communication company. We started our coverage on the company in November, 2013. To review, the company is a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX: OTCQX:DTEGY) which holds a 67% interest. TMUS experienced subscriber growth in the recent past thanks to its ""un-carrier"" strategy. The company offered ""no contract"" plans, frequent device upgrade plans and unlimited data for tablet subscribers which resulted in subscriber growth. The company merged with MetroPCS and also raised financing to expand its spectrum. TMUS has also adopted a zero dividend policy. Essentially, it is trying to increase its subscriber base via aggressive cost reduction strategies fueled by the income saved through cutting dividends. This report is an update on the company's full year financial performance for the year ended 2013 and also features business updates and catalysts that can potentially affect the future prospects of the company.Business Highlights 2013Performance MetricsRevenue and EPSTMUS posted revenues of $24.42 billion as compared to $19.72 billion the previous year. This translates to a growth rate of around 24% which is very healthy. The increase in the revenues of the company was mainly attributable to additional revenues from MetroPCS and the sale of devices, such as the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy S4. Despite an increase in the subscriber base, the revenues from branded postpaid declined. This was most likely caused by the price reduction strategy of the company in the year 2013. The average revenue per user (ARPU) declined and, as a result, the revenues from postpaid customers also declined. Prepaid sales increased because of an increase in the ARPU from prepaid customers. Overall, the strategy to compete on a cost basis was precisely reflected in the company's revenues. The graph below summarizes the revenue position of the company.*Source: SEC filingsThe graph shows that postpaid revenues are declining but equipment sales and branded prepaid grew substantially in 2013, resulting in an overall growth in revenues.ARPUAnalyzing the ARPU trend will give us some perspective on the overall revenue trend of the company. Postpaid ARPU declined by 7% in the year ended 2013 while prepaid ARPU increased by an impressive 28%. This explains the decline in postpaid revenue in the current year.*Source: SEC filingsThe postpaid ARPU is expected to fall in the coming year as well. This is because the current penetration of Simple Choice Plans in the postpaid base is 69% and the company expects it to reach around 90% in 2014. Simple Choice, as we know, is competing on a low cost basis. However, the postpaid revenue (in absolute terms) is expected to increase in the future because of an expected 2.5 million net postpaid customer additions in 2014.TMUS managed to post a positive EPS in the current year. It reported a net income of $35 million as compared to a net loss of $7.4 billion in the previous year. The return to positive income was because of positive movements in revenues and operating costs. Cost of operations declined by 10% despite the revenue increases. There were significant impairment charges in the year 2012 and 2011 but no impairment was recorded in 2013 and hence, overall costs were reduced. If one does not consider these non-recurring expenses, the operating costs were in line with the revenue growth. The graph below summarizes the anticipated EPS position of the company in the coming years.*Source: SEC filings and yahoo financeThe forward P/E 2015 is around 27 whereas the industry average is around 14 indicating that the stock of TMUS is overpriced even if it posts an EPS of 1.08. We will use a cash flow based calculation in the valuation segment because we believe cash flows truly reflect the prospects of the company.Cash and Balance Sheet PositionTMUS has a cash balance of $5.89 billion in the most recent quarter. The current ratio stands at 2.11, indicating that the company faces no short term liquidity problems. Moreover, it generated around $3.54 billion in OCFs in the trailing twelve months. This is quite a substantial amount of operating cash and it seems that the company is undervalued, given that it sustains this level of business and cash flows. However, the capital expenditures of the company are expected to be around $4 billion in the coming year. This affects the cash flows as well as the valuation of the company.Subscriber GrowthTMUS added 4.377 million subscribers in the year 2013 as compared to the 0.203 million added in the 2012 and a total subscriber loss of 0.549 million in 2011. Total branded customer additions were 2.344 million as compared to 1.067 million branded customers lost during the year ended 2012. The price reduction strategy seems to be working for the company and it expects to add another 2.5 million net postpaid customers in the year 2014. The graph below summarizes the subscriber trend of the company.*Source: SEC filingsCustomer retention also improved in 2013. The churn rate was 1.7%, down from 2.4% in the year 2012. We believe that an improved retention rate points to improving network quality.Overall, it seems that the revenue of the company will increase but there will be a tradeoff between ARPU and revenue growth. EPS will not substantially increase given that the company is planning on significant capital expenditures in the near future but this could be seen as an investment because subscribers added due to a price reduction strategy and retained later because of network improvements through additional CAPEX can result in future EPS and, in turn, valuation gains. However, we do not foresee these gains in the coming two years at least.CatalystsTMUS and LTET-Mobile is aggressively rolling out LTE. The service is now available to 203 million people in 95/100 metro areas in the U.S. in just less than a year after its rollout. The company also doubled its theoretical speeds in 40 of the top 50 metro markets. This development puts its system at par with Verizon and Sprint in these areas. The company recently claimed in a press release that its 4G network is the fastest in the U.S. and this claim is supported by mobile data speed tests utilizing the popular Ookla Speedtest app, involving more than 1 million consumers. According to the tests, the LTE network delivers a 17.8 Mbps network speed and is also more consistent. This development enhances the standing of the company in the highly competitive U.S. telecom market. Customers were paying premium charges to Verizon and Sprint because of their superior quality but if T-Mobile attains an equal footing in terms of quality, only the network coverage hurdle will remain between TMUS and the giants. Coverage is not a problem for metro area users and hence, metro users are expected to shift to TMUS because of low costs and no contract clauses.TMUS and ETFsT-Mobile is offering to pay off the early termination fees of potential customers. According to a press release:""With an eligible phone trade-in, the total value of the offer to switch to T-Mobile could be as high as $650 per line.""Note that AT&T recently offered to give a $450 credit to consumers that wanted to shift to AT&T from T-Mobile. T-Mobile's offer is most likely a response and with $650 per line it looks like the hurdle to shift from a network due to ETFs is removed. However, one important point to note here is that these developments initiated price wars which will eventually result in low margins and reduced EPS.T-Mobile's enhanced network and price strategy is expected to attract more subscribers for the company. It looks set to reach its 2.5 million postpaid customer target. However, the price war will result in pressured earnings for the next year or two. TMUS will also witness growth in equipment sales in the year 2014 amid the new Samsung S5 and iPhone6 expected in the fall.Valuations and Final ThoughtsAssumptionsThe price target reveals that the shares are almost accurately valued by the market forces. A mere 6% increase is expected in the coming year or two and the PT is justified amid the increased CAPEX, earning pressure due to price wars and a highly competitive and mature industry with little future growth. TMUS will certainly gain market share and subscribers but a high CAPEX along with a price reduction strategy will post a barrier to valuation growth in the coming few years. The company does not offer any dividends and no capital gains to write home about. Therefore, we recommend investors interested for short term gains to avoid TMUS until it starts a dividend program. For investors looking to build a portfolio with a long term focus, TMUS's subscriber growth and revenue growth make it a value investment with solid long-term potential.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

A merger with MetroPCS provides the company with potential to realize synergies, which will help improve its margins and fuel its earnings. Also, in the recent past, the company has successfully managed to strengthen its subscriber base with aggressive advertisement spending, improved data plans and strategic acquisitions. The company is also likely to benefit from spectrum acquisition from Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Moreover, based on my price target, the stock offers a potential price appreciation of­­­ approximately 13%.Moving in Right DirectionIn a highly saturated U.S telecom industry, with two dominant national players, VZ and AT&T (NYSE:T), TMUS has in the past taken initiatives to gain subscribers and market share through ""price war"" strategies. Some of the competitive strategies undertaken by the company include paying early termination fees and simple pricing plans. The competitive strategies used by the company in recent quarters have been productive, as the company experienced a notable increase in subscriber base and revenue increases. The following chart shows the competitive strategies initiated by the company since March 2013 to address the intense competition in the industry. Source: Investors PresentationThe success of the above-mentioned strategies is evident from the fact that the company experienced net subscriber additions of 4.4 million in 2013. Also, the company experienced notable increases in total revenues in recent quarters. Furthermore, the company also managed to improve its churn rate. TMUS has gained healthy momentum in increasing its subscriber base, which, I believe, is likely to continue in the future. The following chart shows the net additions to postpaid subscribers in the four quarters of 2013.Source: Company's Quarterly ReportsThe following table shows the churn rate of postpaid subscribers for the four quarters of 2013.Source: Investors PresentationThe following table shows the increase in total revenue experienced by the company in the last three quarters of 2013.Source: From 10-K and Company's Annual ReportsAs the company mainly used competitive pricing to address intense competition and strengthen its performance, its average revenue per user (ARPU) was adversely affected. As the company has been successful in strengthening its subscriber base, I believe TMUS will now focus less on price wars and more on better services, which will portend well for its ARPU. The following table shows quarterly ARPU for TMUS postpaid subscribers.Source: Company's Annual ReportsExpected Synergies and 4G LTE ExpansionIn an effort to strengthen its market share and improve future performance, the company acquired MetroPCS in 2013, which, I believe, was a correct initiative taken by TMUS. The company is likely to benefit from total cost synergies of $6-$7 billion (NPV). The company has already been making progress in realizing the synergies, as 2013's synergies came out to be better than expected. In 2013, the company realized actual CAPEX synergies of $675 million against expectations $70 to $135 million, and realized OPEX synergies of $105 million against expectations of $(30) to $30 million.The early initiatives taken by the company to move MetroPCS customers away from the CDMA network to TMUS's GSM and LTE network have been successful. The company has brought 40%, or 3.5 million MetroPCS users to its own network and has successfully deployed 25% of MetroPCS acquired spectrum for its 4G LTE network. The switching of MetroPCS customers to TMUS's network has been faster than expected, and the company expects to shut down MetroPCS services in Las Vegas, Boston and Philadelphia by the end of 2014, which is likely to accelerate the cost synergies and portend well for the company's margins.Also, the company is making healthy progress in 4G LTE deployment. TMUS has successfully installed LTE in 10MHz x 10MHz channels in 86% of its 50 top markets. Also, the company plans 4G LTE coverage expansion to more than 250 million people by the end of 2014, up from 209 million in 2013. The 4G LTE expansion is likely to benefit the company's operational performance, subscriber base and area penetration in the coming quarters. The following graph shows 4G LTE expansion for TMUS. Source: Investors PresentationSpectrum is the major resource that all companies in the telecom sector have been looking to acquire to improve their operations and coverage. Recently, to build upon its spectrum base, the company acquired 700-megahertz A-block spectrum from VZ for $2.4 billion in cash. The acquisition is expected to close by mid-2014.There has been constant speculation about Sprint (NYSE:S) trying to buy TMUS. If the acquisition succeeds, with the FCC's approval, I believe there will be a further price war in the telecom sector. SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBF) President Masayoshi Son said that if regulators allow S to integrate with TMUS, he will start an aggressive price war to expand his market share. ""I want to be number one. So if we are number three, and if we have enough chance, I want to be number one. So I would go to price competition, very aggressively,"" said Son.However, I foresee a very low probability of a merger between S and TMUS, as the deal is likely to face severe scrutiny from antitrust regulators, the Department of Justice and the FCC.Cash Flows and Price Target In the past, the company has mainly focused on competitive pricing to gain market share and strengthen subscriber base. However, recently, TMUS announced a $10 increase on its unlimited data plans, intended to support its cash flows. I believe the recent $10 increase is justified and consistent with TMUS's high-quality internet services. The company's CFO said the raise was needed to monetize data traffic and get back a return on improving network.Price TargetI have calculated a price target of ­­$35, using free cash discounting. For my price target calculation, I used free cash flow estimates till 2019, cost of equity of 9%, after-tax cost of debt of 4% and a terminal-year growth rate of 1.5%. Based on the price target, the stock offers a potential price appreciation of about 13%.Source: Equity Watch Estimates and CalculationsTotal Value to Firm = $516 + $979 + $1,523 + $1,865 + $2,153 + $43,711 = $50,747 million Total Debt = $22,680 million Total Equity Value = Total Value to Firm - Total Equity Value  $28,067 = $50,747 - $22,680 Share Outstanding = 802.54 million  Price Target = Total Equity Value/Share Outstanding  $35 = $28,067/802.54ConclusionThe company is likely to benefit from expected synergies from the acquisition of MetroPCS, which will also improve the company's margins. Also, the company has done well in strengthening its postpaid subscriber base and churn rate. Moreover, the company is making healthy progress in the deployment of the 4G LTE network, which will portend well for its operations and future performance. Furthermore, based upon my price target of $35/share, the stock offers a potential price appreciation of approximately 13%. Due to the above-mentioned factors, I am bullish on the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1946031,53752,2014-01-15T05:15:54-05:00,,"T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is the fourth largest player in the U.S. telecommunication industry, with 45 million total subscribers. I remain neutral on the company because I believe it cannot keep up its subscriber additions and sustain the prevalent price war for a longer period of time. I think Verizon Communication (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T, Inc. (NYSE:T) are more suitable choices for investment in the telecommunication sector with high quality networks and hefty free cash flows. Furthermore, they also offer attractive dividend yields.In the last year, the company's stock price was up by 70% as it managed to add 4.4 million subscribers in 2013. However throughout the year it failed to meet earnings expectations and delivered a negative earnings surprise as shown in the table below.Source: Yahoo FinanceThe company is also highly leveraged, which is another reason why I do not believe that TMUS is a good investment opportunity; the high leverage is shown in the table below. Among its peer companies, VZ has the highest debt-to-equity ratio because it recently acquired a 45% share of VZ Wireless for $130 billion. Also, TMUS does not offer any yield, which gives its peers an edge in attracting income-seekers.Source: Reuters.comSubscriber Growth In the past year, the company managed to turn around its subscriber trend by adding 4.4 million new customers, but I believe it would be difficult to repeat the same growth in postpaid subscriber base, as other carriers have now started to respond to TMUS' strategies. Recently, T offered to give $450 worth of credit to TMUS customers for switching to T. Sprint (NYSE:S) offers some great family packages along with exciting unlimited data plans. In reply to T's offer, TMUS offered $650 worth of credit to any customers switching from any other incumbents.However, it is important to understand that these price wars could result in lower margins and declining revenues for the industry. VZ and T are the telecommunication giants that enjoy superior quality and an extended 4G-LTE framework. Also, both have deep pockets with ample free cash flows, which means they can sustain these price wars for a longer period of time. Also, these brands enjoy more customer loyalty due to their improved network quality. So, I believe Sprint will suffer more in terms of customer loss but on the other hand T's and VZ's churn rates will remain stable and there will be no big surprises for investors in 2014.Low Bandwidth SpectrumThe company raised $4 billion last year in November to buy a low band spectrum, which will not only help improve its services in urban markets but expand its coverage in rural markets along with lower roaming costs. Finally, TMUS has made the deal with Verizon Communications to purchase low-band spectrum for $3.3 billion. I believe this is an important step for the company as the low band spectrum is valuable because of its scarcity, as 75% of these are controlled by the two telecommunication giants, VZ and T. Due to its better traveling ability, customers will enjoy an improved network experience and it comes at a time when TMUS is adding large postpaid subscribers. Furthermore, the company has said that it will continue to look for future opportunities to expand its lower spectrum position in the market.However, there are some impediments to the deal. Firstly, the company will need to spend a significant amount of money to deploy the spectrum. A senior analyst at Wells Fargo estimated that the cost would be around $1 billion. So the total estimated cost will reach beyond $4 billion, the amount initially raised for the transaction. Secondly, channel 51 uses the same airwaves in certain markets, which I believe will remain a concern.Possible acquisition of TMUS by Sprint Although the acquisition of TMUS by S will help the combined company to increase its scale and customer base, which will help it leverage its large spectrum position and further enhance the current price competition. But I believe the acquisition of TMUS is not a great idea because it is expensive, based on the multiples of EV/EBITDA, and most importantly it is on the rise. It is currently trading at the multiple of 8.2x, which is on the higher side among its peers and it is expected to push up further given the high capital expenditures it incurs in a bid to remain competitive and aggressive against its peers. So such values are not justified in a competitive and capital intensive industry. Another important concern for the investor is the expensive funds S has to raise to acquire TMUS. Both of the incumbents also operate on different technologies so it would be more costly to combine.Source: EstimatesGiven the slow growth in the wireless sector, it is obvious that companies are looking to consolidate to drive growth and increase their subscriber base, but nothing has changed since the FCC rejected the acquisition of TMUS by T. Both S and TMUS are primarily responsible for the price wars within the industry that will be discussed later in the article; a potential merger could remove the low-price incumbents from the industry. Finally, the merger could result in the concentrated spectrum holdings, which could change the dynamics of the industry in the long-run with the increasing demand of data. The table below shows the spectrum position in the top 50 markets.Source: Company DataConclusion I do not believe that TMUS can emerge as a winner out of the current price wars, as it does not enjoy superior network quality. It also has limited outreach of 4G-LTE technology as compared to its competitors. TMUS is trading at the top end of its 52-week range and I believe the company is overvalued as indicated by the higher expected 2014 EV/EBITDA ratio. Moreover, the company does not offer dividends whereas its peers have long and increasing dividend histories.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2075683,23479,2014-03-07T17:30:51-05:00,,"The Sprint (NYSE:S)/T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) merger saga continues to see interesting twists, with intense speculation holding sway over market sentiment for both stocks. In the latest development, Deutsche Telekom CEO Timotheus Hoettges is rumored to have told directors on Wednesday that the sale of their 67% stake in T-Mobile is unlikely in the near term. This came only a day after reports that Softbank’s (OTCPK:SFTBF) CEO Masayoshi Son is planning to launch a PR campaign to convince U.S. regulators about the long-term benefits of having a stronger third competitor in the wireless market. Having invested a substantial amount in Sprint, Son is looking to consolidate the U.S. market by buying out T-Mobile, which should give it enough scale and resources to compete more effectively with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). Deutsche Telekom, for its part, is looking to exit the U.S. market but is wary of regulatory roadblocks, which stopped a previous takeover attempt of T-Mobile by AT&T in 2011.Merger Of Disparate NetworksWhile regulatory issues seem to have hogged the limelight with investors responding positively to any rumor that increased the likelihood of a merger, it seems that many of the risks associated with a potential merger are being discounted. Depending on the stake that Sprint wants to acquire in T-Mobile, the deal could cost more than $20 billion and add to Sprint’s ever-burgeoning debt load. It would also require a complicated merger of different network bands and technologies, made all the more risky by the fact that Sprint is currently undertaking an expensive network modernization drive of its own that includes the integration of Clearwire’s (CLWR) spectrum.Sprint currently provides CDMA/FDD-LTE services on 800 MHz and 1900 MHz spectrum, and is building out a faster TD-LTE network using the recently acquired 2.5 GHz spectrum from Clearwire. Meanwhile, T-Mobile is using the 1700 MHz AWS band for LTE and 1900 MHz for GSM/HSPA+ services. It is also migrating MetroPCS subscribers from CDMA to its HSPA+ and FDD-LTE networks. The only frequency band that the two carriers have in common is 1900MHz, on which one is running CDMA/FDD-LTE and the other a GSM/HSPA+ network. Acquiring T-Mobile will require Sprint to perform the complicated task of shutting down one of these networks while transitioning subscribers to the other. For the combined LTE network, Sprint will have a tough time deciding what to do with T-Mobile’s AWS band given that it is already investing a lot of resources into building out its 800MHz/1900MHz/2.5GHz LTE network. Carrier aggregation could be the answer, but securing handsets that can access all the different bands could be a tough task.Sprint Preparing For Potential Dish EntryThe deal makes sense when taking a long-term view of the wireless industry as carriers increasingly move to an all-LTE data network. But the path is fraught with operating risks and complications related to merging disparate networks, which could create a near-term opening for Verizon and AT&T to gain market share at the combined entity’s expense. Given that T-Mobile has been successful in shaking up the wireless industry in recent quarters with its aggressive ""Uncarrier"" initiatives, such as no-contract postpaid plans and quicker phone upgrades, regulators will be wary of such a possibility. In the last three quarters, T-Mobile has managed to add about 2.2 million postpaid subscribers, a sharp reversal from the postpaid loss of about 1.6 million subscribers incurred in the prior-year period.Despite all the regulatory and operational risks associated with the deal, a possible motivation for Sprint to go ahead with a T-Mobile merger could be the emergence of Dish (NASDAQ:DISH) as a potential long-term competitor at the national level. Dish has been aggressively posturing itself as a potential wireless industry entrant, recently winning the bidding for 10 MHz of H-block spectrum for $1.56 billion. This adds to the 40MHz S-band wireless spectrum that Dish acquired from TerreStar Networks and DBSD North America last year. With Dish’s spectrum assets growing, Sprint may be looking to thwart any attempt by Dish to acquire T-Mobile down the road and become a stronger fourth rival.Disclosure: No positions."
1954531,59011,2014-01-20T02:42:39-05:00,,"Sprint and T-Mobile: Schrödinger's Merger, Part 1 examined the regulatory issues regarding market share and concentration and the doctrines of unilateral and coordinated effects. The article concluded that for Sprint (NYSE:S) to successfully merge with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) it would need to demonstrate that an increased market concentration will not lead to excessive market power and that the regulators would need to conclude that the mobile wireless industry is not vulnerable to coordinated conduct pre or post-merger. The next two areas which the regulators will scrutinize are 1) The Disruptive Role of a Merging, and 2) Party and The Entry of New Participants.The merging of a disruptive, maverick firm in the market will be thoroughly reviewed by the regulators. T-Mobile, the self-proclaimed ""UnCarrier"" , is the disruptive force in the U.S. telecoms market. The regulators will need to be convinced that Sprint will continue the market disruptions and maverick ambitions post-merger. I do not believe a Sprint/T-Mobile merger will reverse the maverick effect, but it will be a serious concern for the regulators simply because Sprint has not previously shown a natural tendency toward maverick behavior. The regulators will want to understand the relationship of the maverick firm's effectiveness to constrain coordinating pricing and how its competitors might be more likely to engage in coordinated pricing closer to monopolistic levels post-merger. Furthermore, the regulators will have to understand the role of the maverick firm pre-merger and review the effects of incentives on pricing and data plans in the industry post-merger. The chart below shows the current offerings for each of the four main mobile wireless operators in the U.S.Source: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint websitesAT&T and Verizon's tiered data plans clearly show an inclination towards coordinating pricing, the maverick firm T-Mobile offers the lowest prices to consumers and Sprint's offer is only beneficial if the consumer uses more than 4GB and is not in a T-Mobile coverage area. However, the graph does not tell us the full story because we are not able to measure the ""value"" or the total consumer utility. In order to do this, we would have to understand the network performance of each operator.The graph below compares the average downlink data speeds of the major operators from the consumer's point-of-view (rather than from network KPIs). The reports for Chicago and San Francisco are from October 2013 and the report for New York and the Tri-State Area is from November 2013.Source: ROOTMetrics®These three markets are used as a comparison due to the fact that each operator has officially ""launched"" their respective LTE networks in these areas. This data gives us a starting point (not taking into account coverage maps or other network KPIs) to measure the ""value"" that each consumer might expect when choosing a data plan. The point here is not that Sprint has the worst data speeds or that T-Mobile is arguably the best ""value"" option, rather Sprint might be able to argue the ""efficiencies"" card and that a combined Sprint/T-Mobile company will generate efficiencies that will enhance the firm's ability to compete, lower prices in the market place and improve the quality of the services and ""value"" options to consumers. Sprint will argue that a combined company will be better able to compete against AT&T and Verizon and to possibly force both companies to abolish their tiered plans in favor of unlimited data plans.Sprint needs to argue that both Sprint and T-Mobile as separate companies will not be able to compete with AT&T and Verizon in the medium and long run, but as a combined company it will be able to change the current industry behavior and become a stronger disruptive force. I find the recent announcement that T-Mobile will purchase $3.3 billion worth of A Block spectrum (700 MHz) from Verizon is very interesting as it could be seen as a precursor to a merger with Sprint on the grounds that with this new spectrum Sprint would be more willing to give up an increased amount of its higher frequency spectrum as a bargaining chip to gain regulatory approval. This still might not be enough to please the regulators because there is still another player in the background actively acquiring spectrum and looking to enter the industry.The entry of new participants is the one which I believe Sprint will face a significant challenge to its merger plans. The DOJ's guidelines treat firms which have previously committed to entering the industry as market participants therefore the regulators will review the criteria associated with market share and concentration. However, an entry that would take place more slowly due to the adverse competitive effects of a merger or in which a firm will incur considerable exogenous sunk costs, not recoverable outside of the market, will be considered a new entrant for which different rules apply.The DOJ will examine the enhancement of market power by analyzing the ease of entry into the market based on the following criteria 1) Likelihood (profitability), 2) Timeliness (rapid effect on prices), and 3) Sufficiency (competitive effectiveness). I will explore these three conditions in relation to the industry and the ease of entry and will introduce the concept of endogenous sunk costs to further analyze the criteria of ease of entry and its relation to oligopolistic market structures.The regulators will examine if a new firm will be able to likely make a profit, will be able to enter the market in a timely manner to have an impact on prices and that its entry will be able to sufficiently counteract any effects of competitive concerns. If entry is considered to be easy, e.g. meets all three criteria, then the proposed merger is unlikely to enhance market power, i.e. competition is not reduced and prices could not be raised to increase profit. In the paragraphs below, I will analyze the entry of a new participant into the industry and use DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) in my example with the assumption that the DOJ treats Dish as a non-market participant. The purpose of this example is not to offer an opinion regarding the potential ruling, rather it is to analyze some of the basic entry requirements to the industry which the DOJ will most likely take into consideration.Dish holds spectrum allowed for use in the mobile wireless industry and has plans to acquire more spectrum, but holding spectrum and actually building a high quality network capable of transmitting this spectrum is a massive venture into a vertical outside of its core business. My estimation is that it will take Dish between 3 to 5 years and at least $45 to $50 billion in CAPEX and OPEX (network design, radio base station construction, optimization, IP transmission, core network, network operations, etc.) to build out and operate a network with equal coverage in POPs to effectively compete with its new rivals. It is important to remember that Dish does not have its own fiber network and will have to build an IP backhaul infrastructure which is a key component to all wireless networks.This is where AT&T, Verizon and Sprint have a competitive advantage over new entrants because these three operators have their own nationwide fiber networks. Dish will either have to acquire a firm or lease the fiber lines, which decreases its competitiveness. Dish will most likely have higher customer acquisition costs than its rivals as it attempts to churn customers to its network and will not have the buying power of its rivals in terms of negotiating volume discounts from network equipment vendors or device manufacturers. Each of these unique challenges to enter the industry begins to shape a better understanding of how a new entrant will be able to fulfill the criteria of likelihood, timeliness and sufficiency.We can explore some of the proposals in which Dish might be able to enter the industry to fulfill the three criteria. It is possible that Dish may be able to strike a discounted MVNO agreement with the current market participants while it builds out its own network allowing it to ease into the industry. Dish could then potentially bundle its current services with mobile wireless broadband services and it may be able to have a competitive effect on prices in a reasonable amount of time. Essentially, Dish would enter the industry as wireless broadband provider rather than a traditional wireless operator as the focus would be on LTE and LTE-Advanced. In this scenario, Dish could fulfill the requirements of likelihood and timeliness, but let's review the third criteria of sufficiency.If we look at the third criteria that a new entrant is sufficiently able to enter the market in terms of being able to have an effect on competition and to replicate the scale or strength of a current competitor in the industry, this is where it becomes problematic. Dish has a little over 14 million customers, but its customers already have a mobile wireless plan with one of the current industry participants. Although Dish may be able to ""lease"" a network, it will still have the challenge and expense to build its own network and will need to have a significant value proposition to churn customers towards its ""bundled"" services without having the scale or strength of a current market participant. I believe this is where the regulators will raise red flags because without having the scale or strength of a current market player it will not be easy for Dish to successfully compete or have a pro-consumer impact in the industry.The mobile wireless industry is a de facto oligopoly where the exogenous fixed costs (the initial investment needed to enter the market) are high and where the necessary investments in endogenous sunk costs (network quality improvements, advertising campaigns, etc.) will continue to move the industry towards the lower bound of market concentration. The mobile wireless market is an industry that is characterized by endogenous sunk costs because as the market expands, the firms increase outlays on endogenous sunk costs, and as these costs increase, the industry becomes more concentrated and entry becomes narrowly bounded. It is interesting to note that if every operator were to equally invest in endogenous sunk costs, the investments would not lead to long run profits in the industry.Mobile wireless operators continuously need to invest in these costs in order to improve the quality of their networks, enhance their service offerings and to induce its customers to pay more for the increases in quality. However, if a firm does not decide to invest or invest equally compared to other firms in the industry, then during market expansion the below average quality will only entice consumers to purchase their goods at a discounted price or switch to the better ""value"" options. A Sprint/T-Mobile merger funded by the deep pockets SoftBank will provide the merged company with enough capital to increase its investment in endogenous sunk costs whereby pushing the industry to the lower bound limits of concentration and potentially crowd out a new market participant e.g. Dish.In conclusion, the Sprint/T-Mobile merger faces significant hurdles in terms of the disruptive role of a merging party and the entry of new participants. First, Sprint will have to argue that an elimination of the maverick firm will not lead to the elimination of the current incentives created in a pre-merger marketplace, rather that a merger will lead to efficiencies between the two firms which will improve market competition and value for consumers. Second, the regulators will have to effectively conclude that the ease of entry in a post-merger industry will fulfill the criteria of likelihood, timeliness and sufficiency.In addition to these two factors, we also have to consider market share and concentration and unilateral and coordinated effects as discussed in Part 1. The next several months will be interesting to see if and how much Sprint will offer for T-Mobile, how Dish will respond, and more importantly, how the regulators will rule.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1941271,59011,2014-01-13T07:14:01-05:00,,"The purpose of this article is to highlight the complex and intertwined regulatory issues which are presumed to be the main areas of contention for a successful merger between Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and to provide an analysis so that investors are able to make a better informed decision regarding these two stocks. In my first article, Sprint and T-Mobile US - A Winning Proposition, I proposed a four prong strategy that would allow Sprint to acquire T-Mobile which would assuage the fears of the regulatory agencies and win public support; however, I did not specifically address the regulatory issues believed to be the most critical. In Part 1 I will layout two of the four critical issues that Sprint will have to overcome in order to obtain regulatory approval for the merger which are as follows: 1) Market Share & Concentration, and 2) The Doctrines of Unilateral & Coordinated Effects. I will continue the analysis in Part 2 by reviewing The Disruptive Role of a Merging Party and The Entry of New Participants.The first issue, market share and concentration, is important when it comes to how the regulatory agencies will initially view the potential dissension of the merger. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is the empirical measurement for which the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission use to measure market concentration in a particular industry, with a scale of 0 (perfect competition) to 10,000 (monopolistic). The agency's guidelines for horizontal mergers in highly concentrated markets (HHI > 2,500) and where the proposed merger increases the HHI over 100 points the merger will raise the red flags of antitrust. Moreover, a merger that increases HHI over 200 points presumes to the agencies that competition is at risk due to an enhancement of market power. The HHI for the mobile wireless industry is individually calculated in each of the 172 Economic Areas (EAs) by using the number of mobile wireless connections held by facilities-based mobile wireless operators; the agency then derives the operator's percentage share of connections from the number of these respective connections. The chart below shows the maximum HHI measurement, the minimum HHI measurement and the average measurement which is calculated by the weighted average of all HHIs (weighted by EA) from 2009 to 2011 with an estimate I calculated for 2012 only using the total number of connections for each of the four major operators (I did not use the weighted averages per EA).Data Source: FCC's Mobile Wireless Competition Report (16th Annual)The chart below shows my calculation versus the traditional calculation for the years 2009 through 2011 with the same estimate for 2012 as shown above.The purpose of exercise above is to understand the hypothetical increase of the HHI with a combined Sprint/T-Mobile merger. Assuming that the market share for each operator in 2013 is comparable to 2012, then the average HHI in the mobile wireless industry in a post-merger Sprint/T-Mobile world would increase to 3,349 which is nearly a 450 point increase over the estimate for 2012 or a 486 point increase over the average HHI scores between 2009 and 2011. This increase will almost certainly legitimize the regulatory concerns of increase market power in the industry. However, if Sprint decides to keep the networks separate it might be possible to argue that since approximately 99% of the connections will be on separate networks (due to the separate network technologies) and that only 1% of the connections will be on some type of shared LTE network, then the HHI measurement would barely change and antitrust concerns would be a moot argument based purely on the HHI measurement (currently LTE connections only make up roughly 1% of all connections). I am not completely convinced that the market concentration issue will carry the same weight and scrutiny as it did during the attempted acquisition of T-Mobile by AT&T mainly because I believe there are two other important aspects to this argument which Sprint is in a better position to defensively argue its point where AT&T failed.The two other important points that are necessary to introduce in order to more thoroughly analyze this issue are 1) market concentration is higher with lower density EAs (rural areas) while lower market concentrations are correlated to higher density EAs (urban and dense-urban areas), and 2) highly concentrated markets do not necessarily lead to market power or that firms will engage in anticompetitive pricing models over the long run. The first point is important because some might believe that the FCC will require Sprint to give up spectrum in some EAs as a precursor for the deal to be approved. Since the vast majority of the spectrum controlled by Sprint is in the higher range of the ultra-high frequency (UHF) bands (2.5/2.6 GHz) which will be deployed in the higher density urban areas the concession of this spectrum does not promote the desired changes to reduce market concentration nor will it allow a possible new entrant to build an efficient network outside of these metropolitan areas. A new entrant would have to enter into a roaming and/or a MVNO agreement with AT&T and/or Verizon, the largest holders of spectrum in the lower end of UHF (below 1,000 MHz) which have better propagation properties and are more efficient (larger coverage footprint) for use in rural areas and have better in-building coverage. The fact is that all spectrum is not created equal and for a more competitive market place all operators need to have an equal mix of spectrum, which is not the case at the moment. A scenario that would require Sprint to concede spectrum belies logic because it will not necessarily decrease market concentration in the short or medium terms and it would not change the industry fundamentals where the two industry leaders control the prime, lower frequency spectrum. Regarding the highly concentrated markets, there is a rather lengthy economic argument that we can use to prove that highly concentrated markets do not necessarily lead to market power or that firms will engage in anticompetitive behavior. This can be proved by using elasticity of demand functions to understand a firm's incentive to exercise market power, in particular how a firm takes advantage of market power in relation to increases in prices to consumers. It should be clear that any incentive to increase market power will also be tightly tied to the doctrine of unilateral and coordinated effects and will be highly scrutinized in terms of the effects of the merger on prices and competition in the market.The doctrine of unilateral effects focuses on four areas, but only two of these areas are pertinent to our topic 1) Capacity and Output of Homogeneous Products, and 2) Innovation and Product Variety. The first part of this principle deals with a unilateral output strategy where the suppression of output leads to a rise in profit. One of the criteria for an effective unilateral output strategy is low elasticity of demand and the elasticity of demand for mobile wireless broadband is relatively low because there are no close substitutes, it is a broadly defined good and a higher necessity good. I do not believe a merged Sprint/T-Mobile will be able to benefit from an output suppression strategy, in fact, this argument is relatively dubious because Sprint is not the market leader, T-Mobile is not necessarily offering a homogeneous product at higher operating cost and both companies are already offering unlimited data plans (supply is perfectly elastic). The second area of potential regulatory review will focus on the question of whether or not the merger will diminish competition innovation for new and original product and service offerings. This is the more serious of the two issues and is tangential to the maverick issue which will be discussed in Part 2. T-Mobile is introducing innovative wireless services which are taking market share from Sprint so the regulators will most certainly want to understand how this merger will effect innovation and product offerings post-merger. If the post-merger firm were to eliminate these offerings then the question would be how much harm would come to consumers. If Sprint were to eliminate the innovative services and plans currently offered by T-Mobile where consumers prefer the T-Mobile offerings causing harm to the consumers the DOJ would examine the incentives towards anticompetitive behavior ascribable to the merger.The regulators will review how the merger will affect the coordinated interaction in terms of the incentives to reduce competition through the enhancement of market power and to the extent and probability of coordinated conduct in the industry. The regulators will challenge the merger when there is a strong belief that it may lead to coordinated conduct and if all three of the following conditions are met: 1) there is an increase in market concentration, 2) the market shows signs of vulnerability to coordinated conduct, and 3) there is credible evidence that a merger will enhance this vulnerability.We have already discussed the market concentration issue and now we will examine the four characteristics of an industry that is vulnerable to coordinated conduct, 1) Transparency, 2) Diminished response to churn, 3) Price/value reciprocity, and 4) Low elasticity of demand. The mobile wireless industry shows some vulnerability to coordinated conduct in the areas of transparency where pricing is transparent for homogeneous products and in regards to a low elasticity of demand as discussed above. The industry does not necessarily show vulnerabilities to coordinated conduct in the other two areas because the limited amount of firms in the industry do not show apathy towards churn and fight to reclaim lost customers. The firms that offer the best ""value"" for their services are able to retain customers up until a better ""value"" offer is introduced into the market. Whether or not the industry is vulnerable to collusion and coordinate conduct is nebulous, but I would argue that this is not an industry that is vulnerable to coordinated effects. The next criteria is a bit more complex because the proposed merger involves a maverick firm. I will save the maverick firm analysis for Part 2, but to finish the analysis regarding coordinated conduct I am not convinced that a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile will enhance the vulnerability of coordinated conduct because the merger does not change the paradigm in regards to the response to churn and the price/value reciprocity.In conclusion, a possible Sprint/T-Mobile merger faces resistance to approval as analyzed in the two main areas presented 1) Market Share & Concentration and, 2) The Doctrines of Unilateral & Coordinated Effects. First, Sprint will need to argue that an increase in market concentration is not a deal breaker in terms that it will create excessive market power in the industry. Second, the regulators will have to conclude that the industry is not vulnerable to coordinated conduct and that a merger will not enhance coordinate conduct in the industry. Even if Sprint successfully convinces the regulators that increased market share will not create excessive market power and that the regulators conclude the industry is not vulnerable to coordinated conduct there are still two remaining areas of regulatory inquisition, The Disruptive Role of a Merging Party and The Entry of New Participants, both of which will be examined in Part 2.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1912041,59011,2013-12-23T03:15:44-05:00,,"There has been quite a lot of chatter these past few days regarding the potential merger between the new Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS). The vast majority of the articles I have read argue the deal will have significant difficulties to pass the regulatory requirements of the FCC, will decrease competition and will ultimately fail on its promises to consumers. The issues with having only three major operators instead of four and with having a combined company controlling over two-thirds of the prepaid market are not palatable to many bureaucrats, politicians or consumer advocacy groups. I have also read articles arguing the reasons T-Mobile is not a good fit for Sprint largely due to the incompatibility of the network technologies. On the surface the two networks seem inherently disparate (see the chart below) with a mélange of different frequency bands and technologies. Ordinarily, I would concur with the majority opinion that a merger between these two companies would stymie the competitive fires that drive innovative services and disruptive pricing plans. Moreover, I would tend to agree that even the mere thought of a consolidation of these two networks bears a striking affinity to the Sprint/Nextel network consolidation ""difficulties"".SprintT-Mobile USAOver the next several paragraphs, I will create a scenario for an acquisition of T-Mobile by SoftBank/Sprint that will be both positive for consumers and palatable for the regulators alike. The four part strategy: 1) Management transition and transformation of network operations; 2) Radio network share; 3) Mobile broadband consolidation; and 4) Full network ecosystem consolidation. However, and before I layout my strategy, I propose that the acquisition of T-Mobile by SoftBank/Sprint should not follow the traditional M&A model. My proposal is that after purchasing the controlling interest of T-Mobile US from Deutsche Telecom, the newly acquired asset will remain as an independent and separate company from Sprint. Since Sprint and T-Mobile will be independent entities, SoftBank will need to be resourceful to create synergies between the two companies especially in regards to network management and operations, which leads us into the first part of the strategy.The first part of the strategy, the management transition and transformation of network operations phase, will require SoftBank to create a new company that will be tasked with network management and operations for both the Sprint and T-Mobile networks. The concept would be to create a company similar to Mobile Broadband Network Limited (MBNL) in the United Kingdom. If you are not familiar with the company, MBNL is the management company that currently manages the operations for the shared network of Three UK and Everything Everywhere which was formerly owned by T-Mobile UK. The new company will be independent from Sprint and T-Mobile and will effectively consolidate the network operation activities of both operators with the prime goals of driving down OPEX and bringing operational efficiency to both networks and to execute the network consolidation strategy.The second part of the strategy, the radio network share phase, will be to roll out a shared FDD-LTE radio network by implementing a software feature called Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN) - not to be confused with a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) strategy. Since Sprint and T-Mobile will remain separate entities each operator will keep their own Evolved Packet Cores separate and will implement the MOCN feature in their respective networks which allows a LTE capable device from a Sprint customer to set up a terminating packet call on a T-Mobile radio base station and vice versa. The end user will know exactly which network he or she is connected to because the device will display the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) of the particular operator. The feature allows the consumer to keep their current subscriptions while having access to a far better mobile broadband experience as they will enjoy improved coverage and capacity.The third part of the strategy, the mobile broadband consolidation phase, will mark the start of the network ecosystem and vendor consolidation phase. This phase will create value for the consumers by offering faster network speeds and the operators will be able to offer alternative value-added services to their customers. Mobile broadband networks are capital intensive and take a considerable amount of time to build out. Although Sprint has more spectrum than AT&T and Verizon combined, it suffers because it does not have enough cell sites to truly compete with the big two and the same can be said of T-Mobile. It is a painfully long process in the United States to build out new Greenfield and/or Brownfield sites so by acquiring physical site locations, in this case from another operator, saves both time and precious capital. The shared FDD-LTE network will not only add new physical site locations (improved coverage for both operators) but will also allow for even faster data speeds. Carrier Aggregation is one of the main features of LTE-Advanced which essentially combines the bandwidth of multiple frequencies (up to 5 different frequencies) for a theoretical maximum of 100 MHz of spectrum (the current LTE technology only allows up to 20 MHz of one frequency to be transmitted). One main focus point in order to implement carrier aggregation in the consolidated FDD-LTE network will be to quickly decide on a network vendor strategy early in the process. Sprint contracts to Ericsson, Samsung and ALU while T-Mobile contracts to Ericsson and Nokia (Sprint also has chosen Nokia for its TDD-LTE Spark network). One issue (besides having to redesign and construct the sites, e.g. new antennas) is that carrier aggregation not only requires both the collocation of frequency bands but it also requires that the baseband unit must be from the same vendor i.e. a Sprint cell site with Ericsson hardware must be collocated on a T-Mobile cell site with the same Ericsson hardware. It will become vitally important for SoftBank to take quick action regarding its network equipment vendor strategy in each of its regional markets because at the moment there is not much overlap between the current network equipment vendors in each of the two separate operators' networks.The fourth and last part of the strategy, the network ecosystem consolidation phase, will phase out the 2G and 3G networks which will free up even more valuable spectrum for its LTE-Advanced and future 5G networks. Sprint's 200 MHz of spectrum combined with T-Mobile's 76 MHz of spectrum will give the combined network a total of 276 MHz of spectrum which is 34% more spectrum than both AT&T and Verizon combined. SoftBank through its innovation center in Silicon Valley along with chip makers, device manufacturers and the network equipment vendors will work to build a viable ecosystem of integrated devices that will create a world class end-user experience in an attempt to lure even more customers away from its rivals. Also, as HetNets begins to be rolled out nationwide with the integration of macro, pico and femtocells connecting everything in our daily lives, this new form of network will improve coverage, capacity, speed and value which will be the defining factors for customers in determining their network provider.In conclusion, an acquisition of T-Mobile by SoftBank/Sprint using the proposal presented above will ultimately create a new paradigm in the US mobile telecoms market, assuage the apprehension of both regulators and consumers and improve the overall end-user experience for the approximately 100 million customers and future customers alike. The execution of the strategy will be crucial to the overall success and the players involved will always need to put the demands of their customers first and foremost. Mr. Son knows very well that by increasing his total subscriber base, spectrum holdings and the number of base stations, he will be able to improve his bargaining power over device manufacturers and equipment vendors which is both good for him and his customers. He also knows that by acquiring more spectrum he can build better and faster networks which means a better and less costly experience for his customers. He also knows that by increasing the amount of cell sites, his network will persuade even more potential customers to join his mobile broadband empire.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1923411,24233,2013-12-31T15:15:01-05:00,,"T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) broke from the herd this past year making a strategic decision to stray from the traditional phone subsidy and contact pricing models common in the industry. This change has the potential to be very disruptive. While consumers benefit from cheaper, more flexible pricing models, major carriers such as AT&T (NYSE:T), Sprint (NYSE:S) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) may experience a period of increased competition, lower margins and a loss in market share. For investors, this may -present a near term short opportunity. However, if this disruption is short lived and pricing plans stabilize, the major carriers could rebound rapidly.Investors who are looking to build a position in Verizon or AT&T may want to take a pause and let these events unfold. Currently, both Verizon and AT&T are in the Elevated Risk State according to the SmartStops risk signals indicating higher than normal risk. Price pressure may follow giving investors a better entry opportunity before the competitive landscape settles back down and risk returns to normal.For many years, the US mobile carriers have moved lock in step with respect to customer contract structure and pricing. Traditionally the carriers subsidize the cost of the phone and lock users into two-year contracts. T-Mobile is bucking this trend and has introduced a new sales model, disrupting the standard industry practices. While T-Mobile remains the number four carrier in the US, with its new pricing model, it has recently gained significant market share in terms of users from the other major players including AT&T, Verizon and Sprint. The disruption T-Mobile is causing to the other mobile carriers standard pricing and contract models has the potential to drive margins down at all of them by creating a more competitive environment.T-Mobile First to Separate Phone and ServiceT-Mobile was the first of the major carriers to offer a plan that separated out the phone subsidy from the service portion of the contract in 2013. T-Mobile's contract structure allowed consumers to bring their own phones onto its network, pay off their phone separately from the service contract which gives them the option to upgrade their phone at any time and lower the cost of mobile service. The T-Mobile model is in stark contrast to Verizon's and AT&T's where phones are included as part of the service contract with upgrades offered on the carrier's terms and requiring an extension to the contract. Historically, this led to a sticky customer base with consumers rarely opting to change carriers.As a result of T-Mobile's offering, initially Verizon and AT&T made some tweaks to their service plans, but did not take the threat seriously. However over the next few quarters in 2013, T-Mobile started to grow faster than the other carriers and take away customers, from AT&T in particular. AT&T was first to change its plans to compete with T-Mobile and offer lower monthly service fees for customers using their own devices and allow users to break their phone purchase into installment payments separate from the phone service.For 2014, it is heavily rumored that T-Mobile will adopt even more aggressive tactics to lure customers from the Verizon, Sprint and AT&T. Reports indicate T-Mobile may pay termination fees for customers that are part of most contracts and particularly target users that are part of family plans. Management will release the new plan at CES in January. This would further increase competition and lead to greater customer mobility that would not bode well for the entrenched leaders AT&T and Verizon as well as Sprint.T-Mobile USA and Sprint Merger Could Bailout Shareholders of VZ and TSprint is at a crossroads and could join T-Mobile in pioneering new pricing and contract structures or acquire T-Mobile. The latter would cause the industry to return to is oligopolistic structure and decrease competition.Sprint was recently acquired by SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBF), controlled by billionaire Masayoshi Son. Industry analysts such as Kevin Smithen at Macquarie expected a cash infusion from SoftBank into Sprint to fund an aggressive strategy similar to T-Mobile's (read more). This would further force the hands of Verizon and AT&T to undertake actions to stop share losses, benefit consumers but not the shareholders of the two industry leaders.This view changed, when Sprint announced its intention to make a bid for T-Mobile this past month. The acquisition of T-Mobile, could preserve margins and cause a return to the prior status quo for Sprint and the other carriers. The merger of Sprint and T-Mobile USA would create a carrier similar in size to Verizon and larger than AT&T. It is important to remember the Department of Justice and FCC blocked a proposed merger between AT&T and T-Mobile a few years ago. Sprint is smaller in size and as a result has a better chance of overcoming challenges from regulators, however substantial roadblocks remain.A deal would need to overcome concerns that it is bad for consumers. The benefits to the consumer from T-Mobile's strategy discussed earlier magnify this case. Son has challenged regulators before in Japan and it was reported the SoftBank CEO is already assembling a lobbying team in Washington. A deal is possible and would result in three large, but evenly sized carriers, and none with a market share over 40%, historically a threshold for the DOJ.In addition to challenges from the DOJ, the merger will face FCC challenges. There are wireless spectrum auctions planned for 2014 and 2015. Four versus three major bidders could decrease the total revenue received by the FCC. The auction proceeds are intended to pay for a national wireless emergency network and also contribute to deficit reduction. Approval may take into 2015, after the auctions, but this does create an additional challenger and roadblock.SmartStops indicates Verizon & AT&T are in Periods of Elevated RiskSmartStops indicated both stocks are in periods of elevated risk due to the threat from T-Mobile and uncertainty if a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile is possible and will change the landscape.Verizon Entered an Elevated Risk State on December 5, 2013 according to the SmartStops Aggressive Risk Signals.View full Risk State Analysis For VerizonSmartStops shows AT&T has been in this period of elevated risk longer than Verizon. In the article Reuters article noted above, the 3Q13 industry data showed that AT&T actually had a decline in its user base. The data was published in early November, coinciding with the increased risk level to shareholders. Verizon fared better in the data but rumors of T-Mobile's new strategy in early December contributed to elevated risk in the stock.View full risk state analysis for AT&TIn the preceding chart, AT&T shares entered an elevated risk state that SmartStops signaled. A re-entry point of $36 is recommended. Talks moving forward on a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, could act as the catalyst that return the shares of AT&T to that level.ConclusionFor both Verizon and AT&T, uncertainty around T-Mobile's marketing and customer acquisition strategy for 2014 have put pressure on their shares and increase levels of risk as indicated by the SmartStops risk signals. If T-Mobile takes a less aggressive approach to customer acquisition in 2014 or if T-Mobile is acquired, the risk levels of Verizon and AT&T could return to normal. This event may prove to be a good entry point for investors that believe Verizon and AT&T will resume their upward march.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1898831,20991,2013-12-15T03:45:52-05:00,,"It's a standard part of flying, these days: the minute you touch down, you pull out your phone and get back up to speed with the world - especially if you've been on a long flight without wifi. And then there's the standard exception: when you're flying internationally, you don't. Not unless you're very rich, or very reckless, or someone else is paying your phone bill.Which is what made my arrival in Auckland this morning so special: I touched down after a long flight, pulled out my phone, cycled through Twitter and email and Foursquare, and didn't stress at all about being charged $20.48 per megabyte (or whatever) in a world where I have no idea how many megabytes are involved in any of those activities.But I just switched to T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), which has free international data. I've been using it for about 12 hours now, in Auckland and Wellington, and it's been fantastic. I'd heard complaints about how slow it was, and I haven't been trying to stream video, or anything like that, but basic things like maps and Google searches work fine.I was already a fan of T-Mobile in any case: its LTE network is blazingly fast, its pricing is astonishingly simple and transparent, I've had very few dropped calls, and, the one time I did have a serious issue which required non-trivial customer service, their T-Force social customer support team came through with flying colors. It's a big company, and there are still rough patches. But the ""uncarrier"" campaign is more than just a slogan, and makes it much easier to give T-Mobile the benefit of the doubt when things go wrong.All of which explains why I got a horrible sinking feeling in my stomach when I saw the news that Sprint is working on a bid for T-Mobile. The first thing I thought of, when I saw the headline, was the documentary ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"", about the General Motors (NYSE:GM) EV1 of the mid-1990s. Electric cars could have had their start back then; instead, we had to wait almost 20 years. When you're developing a new product which is a serious threat to the biggest players in the market, it makes sense for those players to shut you down.The resurgence of T-Mobile was in no sense a predictable thing. Suffering from neglect and underinvestment, it agreed to be bought by AT&T (NYSE:T) in March 2011 for $39 billion. But when that deal got scuppered by the Justice Department, T-Mobile took its $4 billion break-up fee and started shaking up the industry in a very welcome and unexpected manner.If Sprint (NYSE:S) does buy T-Mobile, it certainly won't be because the two companies are any kind of natural fit. As Sascha Segan explains, there are a lot of reasons not to do this deal, including the fact that the combination of the two is a ""technological nightmare"":That said, it's easy to see why Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBF), Sprint's new owner, would want to buy and neutralize T-Mobile. Softbank does have deep pockets. What it doesn't have is any desire to get involved in the telecommunications equivalent of a land war in Asia, attacking two huge entrenched incumbents while needing to expend extra energy fighting off a nimble smaller competitor at the same time.In other words, this bid, if it ever materializes, is an anti-trust no-brainer - and the T-Mobile board could be forgiven for regretting that they ever hired John Legere in the first place. Ironically, a weak and feeble T-Mobile might actually be worth substantially more than a seriously competitive T-Mobile, since the latter will have a much harder time passing anti-trust scrutiny.Still, the die has been cast, at this point, and T-Mobile is on a roll. There's something very refreshing about actually paying full price for the phone you use, either up front or on an installment plan, instead of signing up for an overpriced two-year contract and kidding yourself that you're getting the phone for ""free"" or cheap. Segan calls T-Mobile's Equipment Installment Plan its ""one true innovation"", because it manages to ""bridge the perception gap between the subsidized world and the no-contract world"" - if you're on the plan, you still end up paying less per month than you would on Verizon (NYSE:VZ) or AT&T, even with the extra cost of (say) an iPhone 5s added on a separate line item.True innovations are rare in industry, and the US consumer has undoubtedly benefited from this one. It's just a little bit depressing that T-Mobile might have ended up being worth more if it had simply withered slowly away instead.Disclosure: none."
1861091,56922,2013-11-25T10:14:26-05:00,,"T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) has shown a solid financial performance and substantial subscriber growth over the last few years. It is instigating an intense price war in the telecom industry by launching a number of products targeting value consumers. However, this is not the full story and we believe this intense price competition is due to other ulterior motives. There is also speculation that T-Mobile is purchasing spectrum from Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which will further strengthen its network offerings. An unnamed source told Reuters that T-Mobile has set aside $3 billion to buy unused spectrum from Verizon. Verizon is also interested in selling off some parts of 700 MHz band spectrum. This deal, if goes through, will be beneficial for TMUS in enhancing the reach and power of its network.Financial PerformanceRevenueT-Mobile posted revenues of $6.7 billion in the quarter ended September 2013. $5.1 billion was generated from services and $1.5 billion from equipment. The revenue recorded an increase of 36% compared to the corresponding quarter of 2012. The increase was 8% when compared to the previous adjacent quarter, i.e. June 2013.The total revenue was $5.1 billion for the year ended 2012 whereas the company posted revenues of around $14 billion in the three quarters of 2013, with the results of one quarter still pending.EarningsEBITDA: T-Mobile posted an EBITDA of $1.3 billion in the recent quarter as compared to $1.2 billion in the quarter ended September 2012. This is a growth factor of approximately 8%. However, with revenues increasing by 36%; the earnings did not increase in line, indicating high operating costs for the current quarter.EPS: T-Mobile posted a loss of $0.049 per share as compared to a substantial loss of $14.4 per share posted in the same quarter last year.In Annual terms, earning and net income is improving year on year and the company managed to achieve a net income CAGR of 27% (2008-2012). The trend is expected to continue in the future.Cash flow situationThe cash and cash equivalents balance of the company stands at $2365 million as compared to $394 million in December 2012. This clearly indicates that the cash situation has been improving since December 2012. The current ratio is 1.45 compared to an industry average of 1.12, indicating that there are no liquidity problems. The company's cash flow statement indicates a $3 million increase in the net cash position at the end of the current quarter. This is also because T-Mobile does not have any dividends obligations on common stock. Industry average yield stands at 1.06%. The company is not paying dividend while most of its competitors in the telecom wireless communications industry pay substantial dividends.Business performanceSubscriber growthT-Mobile recorded a subscriber growth of 2.3%, ending the quarter with 45 million customers. This allowed the company to beat expected phone customer acquisition for the previous two years. It added more than 1 million net customers, including 648,000 branded postpaid net customer additions. While its biggest rival, Verizon Wireless reported a bigger overall subscriber growth number of 927,000, T-Mobile blew past the No. 2 U.S. mobile provider AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), which added 363,000 subscribers, and Sprint Corp. (NYSE:S), which lost 360,000. Smartphone sales increased by 1% during the most recent quarter, taking the T-Mobile's U.S. smartphone sales share to 13.2%. T-Mobile is closing in on Sprint Corp., which holds 14.6% share of the U.S. smartphone sales. Note that Sprint now has the financial backing of Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBF) group and the airwaves from Clearwire (CLWR).Drivers of the performanceT-Mobile merged with MetroPCS in mid 2013. Since then, the company has seen an improvement in its performance; both in terms of financials and in terms of customer acquisition.The company has been aggressively marketing its services by offering new and innovate packages on a low cost basis. The following are some unique offers launched by the company in the recent past.Un-carrier incentives T-Mobile offered Simple choice, JUMP®, unlimited data and revolutionized tablet plan in this incentive.Simple choice offers no annual contract and device financing with EIP (equipment installment plan).JUMP® offers frequent device upgrades and attractive rates.Tablet plan T-Mobile offered tablets with life time data plan with 200MB free data every month.MetroPCS On July 25, 2013, T-Mobile announced the strategic expansion of the MetroPCS brand with the planned launch of 15 new geographic markets. It has already launched more than 1,300 distribution points in these new markets at the end of the third quarter 2013. The planned expansion will increase the geographical presence to a total of 30 markets by the end of November. The company began selling T-Mobile compatible devices to MetroPCS customers in the second quarter through branded distribution points and has already transitioned more than 1.5 million new and existing MetroPCS customers to the T-Mobile network. This development helped T-Mobile to increase revenues.Smartphones The launch of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone S and iPhone C and Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) Galaxy S4 was also a feature of the smart phone industry this year. Combined with T-Mobile's un-carrier incentives, these smart phones assisted T-Mobile to increase its subscriber base and revenues.Secondary OfferingAccording to Reuters, T-Mobile is offering 66.15 million common shares. It will use the proceeds to secure spectrum, i.e. airwaves, to bolster its wireless capacity. Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY), which owns 74% of T-Mobile, announced on Twitter that its stake would be cut to 67%. The share price is anticipated to decline after this development because of investor concerns over dilution. The offering will not send any bad signals to the market regarding the worth of the shares, but it is expected that T-Mobile will use the proceeds to expand its spectrum. Therefore, this activity of raising finance will not have a substantial effect on the current share price.Acquisition prospectsBack in 2011, AT&T tried to acquire T-Mobile but the deal failed because the Department of Justice deemed that it will affect the competitiveness of the industry by positioning AT&T as a dominant player. Furthermore, T-Mobile has signed a merger deal with MetroPCS. However, since than the dynamics of the industry have changed and any such deal would be examined in an entirely new light. With the waning margins and increasing foreign investment (Softbank and Sprint) the prospects of a T-Mobile sale are much brighter. Even if AT&T doesn't get consent from the authorities, foreign companies have also shown interest in taking this deal.Valuation:Price earnings ratio of the company is 47.20x which is very high when compared to industry average of around 19x. PEG ratio of the company stands at 38 indicating price paid by investors is disproportionate to the growth estimates. The P/E in this case is irrelevant for valuation purposes because the investor is not valuing the earnings actually but the future growth in subscriber base and network quality. P/S ratio, on the other hand is more relevant in the case of TMUS and we will use P/S ratio for the valuation purposes.This price target indicates that the share price have little growth prospect for now.ConclusionT-Mobile has been showing better results in the last two quarters and is now in a better position to compete with the big players of the market. The revenues of the company have been increasing in the recent past, primarily due to the merger with MetroPCS; with the un-carrier incentives also playing a vital part in the increasing revenues and subscriber base. Earnings did not increase in line with revenue because of high operating costs in the most recent quarter but at an annual run-rate, T-Mobile's earnings are growing.Since the merger, T-Mobile is not paying dividends and it seems to have no intention of doing so in the near future. It is offering shares to raise finance which will help in the management of subscriber growth via an expanded spectrum. So, with satisfactory financial and business performance and future plans to expand its spectrum, T-Mobile is in a position to compete with Verizon and AT&T. Low cost strategy, i.e. cheaper call rates and service charges provides a competitive advantage for the company.While the price competition has the obvious intention of increasing subscribers and driving revenue growth, the company might have an ulterior motive for this strategy. Price based competition positively impacts the top line but ultimately weakness the bottom-line and is bad for the entire industry. This price based competition will likely increase the pace of consolidation in the U.S. telecom industry and force players like AT&T, Verizon etc. to buy off small industry players. This strategy of only focusing on revenue and subscriber growth will allow T-Mobile to garner a higher price in such a scenario because ultimately existing subscribers are the most attractive part of any telecom acquisition deal. Therefore, we believe this subscriber growth has made T-Mobile a hot acquisition target for major telecom players. If we look at P/S for an indicator of acquisitive value, TMUS is trading at much lower P/S as compared to competitors. The company is effectively using cash meant for dividends to grow subscribers.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1920211,39301,2013-12-30T02:35:08-05:00,,"I'm going to dedicate this article to answering 6 key questions a fellow contributor of Seeking Alpha had asked me. Hopefully by answering these questions you will be able to come away with a fuller understanding of Sprint's (NYSE:S) take-over of T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS).What if Softbank/Sprint buys out only DT's stake at whatever valuation and leaves the float trading as a stub? In the absence of a tender, why should the publicly trading stub appreciate?I don't think it's very likely that SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY) will buyout Deutsche Telekom's stake without giving a tender offer to T-Mobile's remaining shareholders. While Deutsche Telekom has a 72% stake in the stock, SoftBank would most likely buy in equal proportion of shares from both a public and private float.In the absence of a tender offer, for the public float, it's likely that T-Mobile stock will continue to appreciate. T-Mobile and Sprint when combined could generate significant cost efficiencies by closing overlapping operations that are no longer necessary (call centers, retail locations, and administrative tasks). Also, because T-Mobile, Sprint, and SoftBank are joined together, the combined entity may have enough mobile subscribers to negotiate lower prices on mobile handset devices. Leveraging economies of scale should be sufficient enough of a growth catalyst to move the value of T-Mobile stock higher.Considering the larger carriers all own more spectrum than they actually use and seem to be ""spectrum squatting"" (i.e. buying up all the spectrum so small competitors can't compete), is the additional spectrum beyond the bundle already owned by S/CLWR really going to add value?It's hard to say that the additional spectrum won't add value, but it's hard to say that it will. Data consumption is expected to explode, and the number of mobile devices per user is expected to increase significantly.Source: StatistaThe added spectrum could come in handy as the amount of data consumption per device is expected to grow from 600MB per month to 2.2GB per month. This is a 25% compound annual growth rate over the next six years. Having 228 MHZ of spectrum (Clearwire, Sprint, and T-Mobile) should give Sprint a distinct advantage against AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in the future.Considering both S and TMUS have historically struggled to hang on to postpaid subs, and Sprint continues to lose postpaid subs, why would this marriage of two losers produce a winner?Well it's likely that over the short-term subscriber figures could drop even further. However, as cost efficiencies and further investment into network technologies continue a higher percentage of revenue can be converted into profit. Currently Sprint's operating margin is 1.23%, and T-Mobile's is 5.18%. Currently, Verizon's operating margin is 14%. So you 'd have to think that by Sprint and T-Mobile being combined they can drive operating margins that are closer to Verizon's, and in turn grow profit exponentially in a very short period of time. By having positive cash flow, Sprint and T-Mobile can invest more aggressively into network infrastructure to keep pace with Verizon and AT&T.So it all comes back to ensuring that T-Mobile and Sprint are able to drive better margins, which would in turn lead to better capital expenditure spending. A better network will retain customers, and the slightly lower prices offered by T-Mobile and Sprint for post-paid plans will result in market share losses for AT&T and Verizon eventually.With interest rates rising (10 year treasury > 3%, maybe even 3.5%) any financing for this deal will require junk levels of interest payments. Why would that not add a huge headwind?Well it depends on how the deal is financed. This is where currency arbitrage and leveraging lower interest rates from different markets comes into play. Currently the Japanese 10-Year treasuries are less than 1%. Implying that the amount of interest that SoftBank would have to pay despite being junk levels bonds would not reach the level of interest that would have to be paid for a U.S. issuance of debt. In an environment where interest rates are artificially depressed like Japan the spread between higher and lower risk debt is narrow enough so that the cost of interest is also lower even on the riskier end of the spectrum. This is why SoftBank is pursuing a capital raise with Japanese banks, however there are also rumors that SoftBank is also in discussions with Goldman Sachs, and other U.S. based investment banks as well.In the end, SoftBank will borrow cash at the lowest interest possible. I estimate that SoftBank will pay no more than 8% on a ten-year note. The cost of interest can be fully covered with the net income that SoftBank currently earns from its operations. So I don't think it's a very significant head-wind. Perhaps when the note reaches maturity, SoftBank would have to reduce CAPEX spending, but that's so far in the future I really wouldn't worry about it.Postpaid cellphone plans are already very expensive. At what point does the law of supply and demand constrain future price hikes? All these articles on telecoms talk as though demand is inelastic. Already for a family of 4, a family plan with limited data runs $250-$300 after taxes. I don't think there is room for a whole lot of growth there.Growth will probably have to come from new household formations or even further consolidation of the overall communication industry. If there's no further consolidation by mobile telecoms buying more traditional communications companies like Century Link (CTL) and DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) then revenue growth would have to depend heavily on price increases with marginal growth in aggregate population to drive sales.Source: International Telecommunication UnionCurrently the income elasticity of demand is 0.34 for phones. This low level of elasticity implies that pricing can increase without having too significantly of a negative impact on demand going forward. However, the increase in pricing would have to be gradual as the price of mobile plans in the United States is already the highest in the world at $80 per month per user.Given saturation of the US market, any gain by S/TMUS must come from T or VZ. Why would anyone switch to S/TMUS unless for lower prices or features like ""unlimited data"" which invite adverse selection? How will that increase revenues or decrease costs?As I have mentioned earlier both T-Mobile and Sprint already operate at lower operating margins than AT&T and Verizon. However, the added spectrum allocated to Sprint and T-Mobile will allow the duo to continue to offer unlimited data despite high rates of data consumption growth. Cash from SoftBank will have to be directly invested into Sprint's and T-Mobile's CAPEX in order to keep the defect rate lower. However, with lower pricing, and better service features, Sprint and T-Mobile should be able to increase revenues with user growth.Because network technologies are a fixed expense, offering unlimited data shouldn't have too negative of an impact to expenses, assuming the cost of network build out isn't proportional on a percentile basis to data usage. In fact, I'm sure that as economies scale, margins will improve despite rising data usage.ConclusionI hope by answering these specific questions I have been able to address any concerns I have not been able to with previous articles I have written on the topic. Granted the merger is not set in stone yet, but with investment banks lining up to offer financing to SoftBank/Sprint, I'm thinking the cat is pretty much out of the bag.Additional details will be released when SoftBank and Sprint propose a tender offer to T-Mobile shareholders.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1908561,39301,2013-12-19T16:33:29-05:00,,"There are rumors floating around that Sprint (NYSE:S) may in fact buy out T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS). There are very strong arguments that favor a T-Mobile deal, but there are a ton of arguments that support the conclusion that T-Mobile would not be a very good buyout candidate for Sprint. The arguments that go against the deal are numerous, but I'm going to try and highlight a couple of them in order to specify whatever it is that is going on.Setting the stageUsually I like to identify key trends in an industry and give a basic overview of a whole sector space in order for you all to grasp the context of whatever it is I am saying. This is important because I often make really strong claims, but to make these claims means that I have to substantiate whatever it is I am saying from a rigorous foundation of knowledge. So hopefully I can get you all on board with my thought process.Softbank, one of Japan's largest telecoms bought out Sprint. The buyout was considered to be the largest foreign acquisition of a U.S. company in history. Sprint stock was tanking and what saved the downward spiral was a buyout valued at $21.6 billion. The buyout was smaller than what was offered by DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) at the time, but promised to return shareholders substantially more value. In fact, following the buyout of Sprint by Softbank, Sprint is still publicly traded on the New York Stock exchange as there's still a bit of a float because the terms of the buyout still necessitated the need for a secondary market for Sprint shares.Shortly following that event, Sprint eventually bought out Clearwire at a $14 billion valuation, granted Sprint already owned 50% of Clearwire at the time, so the actual cash spent to buyout the remaining half was closer to $7 billion.Currently, I'm borrowing data from a DISH Network acquisition presentation. The fact is, DISH Network never got to acquire Sprint and Clearwire. But if we combine the spectrum of Sprint and Clearwire the wireless spectrum dedicated to the Sprint network is approximately 185 Mhz, which is almost twice that of both AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ).Source: DISH NetworkSo if the capital expenditure on the part of Sprint can scale further, at least in theory, Sprint would have the best wireless network in the United States.T-Mobile and Sprint can be a happy marriageCurrently T-Mobile has 50 MHz of wireless spectrum. T-Mobile has the lowest amount of spectrum among all the major telecoms in the United States. Plus, it also has the worst network according to consumer surveys, which doesn't help T-Mobile whatsoever.Source: PiperJaffrayCurrently T-Mobile may have no other practical exit strategy than to be bought out. Approximately 55% of T-Mobile customers want to switch networks, which is bad. T-Mobile is known to have awesome pre-paid packages, so if you want to save money, go with T-Mobile. However, T-Mobile isn't the only low cost carrier. Sprint operates the Virgin Network, which offers price competitive pre-paid plans as well.So in a sense a vast majority of the product niches in the space have been saturated. While some have argued that T-Mobile offers compelling international coverage, it doesn't change the fact that T-Mobile will never catch up to the Sprint, Verizon and AT&T.According to Dylan Tweney from Venture Beat:However, that may true with regards to GSMA and CDMA technologies when it comes to 2G and 3G frequency bands. The same exact case doesn't exactly play out when dealing with the 4G LTE standard, which standardizes the frequency bands just enough so that various OEMs like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can fit all the necessary frequency bands within a single device to account for network compatibility.So the argument that Sprint and T-Mobile can't pool together network resources simply isn't true. Sprint and T-Mobile can have interoperable compatibility with their 4G LTE networks helping to push greater economies of scale between the two cellular telecoms assuming a merger were to take place. So even if T-Mobile and Sprint are technically building out 4G LTE networks with varying frequency bands, technology is making up for that. To be more specific, within the Apple iPad air is the Qualcomm MDM 9615M 4G LTE Modem, which will eventually be integrated into other SOCs (system on a chip) for other device manufacturers assuming a two year rolling refresh cycle. For those unfamiliar to mobile semiconductors, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has a monopoly on modem technologies in the mobile space, so it's highly probable that any handset shipped in the next couple years will come with this new modem technology. There will no longer be any need for differing modems inside of mobile devices in the United States. This neutralizes the argument that T-Mobile and Sprint will not be able to integrate 4G network technologies together.According to Dylan Tweney from Venture Beat:This argument also falls flat on its face, because regulators probably wouldn't mind having a 3rd well capitalized competitor with comparable subscribers and network resources competing with AT&T and Verizon. Some will mention the Sherman Act (1890) to base their claims of anti-trust scrutiny, but that legislation is very limited in scope when compared to the acts that follow, which include the Clayton Act (1914), Robinson-Patman Act (1936), and Celler-Kefauver Act (1950).According to Foundations of Microeconomics, the acts prohibit the following practices only if they substantially lessen competition or create monopoly:So because AT&T was attempting to create a monopoly through its acquisition of T-Mobile, it wasn't allowed to acquire competitor's shares or assets. But in the case of Sprint and T-Mobile being merged it would not substantially lessen competition nor would it create a monopoly, which negates the penalties that are imposed on companies that are either engaged in a monopoly or attempting to create one.According to Dylan Tweney from Venture Beat:This argument also falls short of logic. Sure, T-Mobile and Sprint combined wouldn't amount to much. But when you combine the scale of resources between Softbank, T-Mobile, Sprint and Clearwire the picture starts to change quickly based on the graphic below.Source: SoftbankNow, currently Sprint/Softbank's capital expenditure is $11.9 billion. However, when you combine the capital expenditure of $3.7 billion from T-Mobile into this equation, the consolidated capital expenditure would climb to $15.6 billion on an annual basis.Softbank's 4G network build out in Japan will slow as the net geographic area in Japan is pretty limited. Softbank's network build out in Japan is nearing completion allowing for CAPEX to be redirected to its Sprint subsidiary.Source: SoftbankTherefore the combined capital expenditure of $15.6 billion (T-Mobile included) would primarily go toward building out a more competent 4G LTE network in the United States. This means that a Sprint and T-Mobile merger may at least result in a coverage map that gets closer to AT&T's and Verizon's.Currently 44% of consumers believe that 4G is important when considering their next phone purchase. This implies that whoever has the fastest 4G LTE network build out will at least win the hearts of consumers, and right now Verizon is winning by a significant landslide.Source: VerizonCurrently Verizon is rolling out its 4G LTE network fast so that it can also use Voice over LTE technologies. The Voice over LTE technologies avoids the frequency bands of older network technologies from the CDMA and GSM days. When considering voice over technologies can also run through LTE, it's imperative for T-Mobile and Sprint to merge sooner rather than later. This is so they can leverage voice over technologies on LTE frequency bands rather than balance costs of cell towers on older CDMA and GSM technologies.Reasonable buyout valueWhen considering Clearwire was bought out at a $14 billion valuation just for owning spectrum without having a single wireless customer, it's improbable that a T-Mobile buyout will only be worth $20 billion.Source: CNN MoneyThe premium paid for a stock is closer to 25% in the case of M&A. T-Mobile's share price prior to rumors of a buyout was around $25.44 per share. That gave the stock a market capitalization of around $20.39 billion prior to rumors of a buyout. If we assume that a buyout were to materialize, assuming a 25% M&A premium it would take Softbank/Sprint $25.5 billion to take T-Mobile private.However, if we look at history, it took Softbank a 52% buyout premium to buy out Sprint. This involved a bit of a tug of war that was unprecedented in American telecoms. That being the case, if in the event Verizon or AT&T attempt to thwart a buyout of T-Mobile by getting into another bidding conflict, we could easily see the buyout premium expand significantly. The question is whether the other major phone carriers will even bother to put in a bid when anti-trust regulation would work heavily against them, and heavily favor a T-Mobile and Sprint merger.So in the best case scenario, T-Mobile may end up trading at a frothier value of $30.6 billion. Now, I know the question you're thinking. Can Softbank/Sprint even afford a $30 billion merger? The answer is a resounding yes.Source: SoftbankAfter converting the total equity figure into dollars, Softbank when including Sprint has $24.512 billion in shareholder equity. So it can technically borrow cash against the value of its assets and reach a tender offer that can at least reach $30 billion. Also remember that Japanese interest rates remain miserably low (2.87% for generic 10-year Japanese treasury), so a corporate issuance of bonds along with other sources of credit can be used without diminishing the financial stability of Softbank too severely. T-Mobile has shareholder equity of $3.35 billion, which would add equity (in the event of a merger) to Softbank's balance sheet. In other words, T-Mobile's and Softbank's assets and liabilities would be consolidated in order to borrow cash. This would add enough collateral to bridge any funding gaps needed for a leveraged buyout.I also want to mention that there are plenty of investment banks willing to lend cash to telecoms as cash flows are fairly predictable. The cost efficiencies by combining Sprint and T-Mobile will help to pay down the debt and interest sooner. So from a financial standpoint it's definitely workable.ConclusionMuch of the speculation with regards to the buyout has been misguided. Of course the financial impact would be huge as it would take significant leverage on Softbank/Sprint's balance sheet to be pulled off.An acquisition of T-Mobile would be accretive to Sprint shareholders while an upside catalyst for T-Mobile investors. I will write a more in-depth discussion of financial impact, gains in market share and potential earnings that may be realized by long-term equity holders of Sprint once a deal has been formally announced.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1732232,41381,2013-10-07T11:36:05-04:00,,"On Friday, October 4, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) announced its plans to hold an ""Uncarrier 3.0"" event in NYC. T-Mobile will use the NYC event (featuring Shakira) to unveil the third part of its self-proclaimed strategy to upend the U.S. mobile industry.Previously, the first part of T-Mobile's strategy involved rolling out contract-free service plans that eschewed traditional phone subsidies in favor of monthly installments and the second part involved the launch of the carrier's Jump smartphone early upgrade plan. In the wake of Friday's announcement, I wanted to highlight a number of reasons behind my decision to remain bullish on shares of T-Mobile.No. 1 - Recent Performance and Trend StatusOn Friday shares of TMUS, which currently possess a market cap of $8.77 billion, a beta of 0.85, and a P/E ratio of 27.77 settled at a price of $26.38/share. Based on their closing price of $26.38/share, shares of TMUS are trading 3.58% above their 20-day simple moving average, 7.05% above their 50-day simple moving average, and 20.18% above their 200-day simple moving average. These numbers indicate a short-term, mid-term and a sustainable long-term uptrend for the stock, which generally translates into a moderate buying mode for most traders.No. 2 - An Interesting Share of the Smartphone MarketOn Monday September 30, Kantar Worldpanel announced its estimates for U.S. carrier smartphone sales for the months of June through August 2013. Among the U.S. carriers featured, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) led the pack as its sales accounted for 37.1% of all U.S.-based smartphone sales in the above mentioned timeframe. During that period its market share grew 520 bps on a year-over-year basis.Although Verizon's sales accounted for 37.1% of all U.S.-based sales, it was T-Mobile's sales that actually caught my eye. Coming in at a market share of just 13.2% (up 110 bps), T-Mobile could surpass those in the ""Other"" category (13.4%, up 500 bps) if in fact the company's ""Uncarrier 3.0"" event results in a clear increase of users through the end of the fourth quarter.A Few Risks to ConsiderAccording to Equity Watch, there are a number of risks associated with a long-term position in T-Mobile. For example, it was noted that ""With Verizon Communications gaining full control of its wireless segment and the massive investment of SoftBank in Sprint Corporation (NYSE:S), the industry is now very competitive. Carriers are competing aggressively for market share, which means that there will be significant price pressure in the future. Moreover, the acquisition of Leap Wireless (NYSE:LEAP) by AT&T (NYSE:T) could also intensify competition, as LEAP operates in those regions where TMUS has a strong presence. With the increasing demand of high bandwidth, TMUS might face spectrum constraints in the future, and it will be dependent on spectrum auctions and M&As.""Although Equity Watch touches on the competitiveness of the industry and how various M&A activity that could hinder T-Mobile's U.S.-based growth, we must note that any downtrend in market share could negatively affect shares. Until more proven data is delivered, I wouldn't put all my eggs in one basket when it comes the company's ""Uncarrier 3.0"" campaign even though it has shown some promise (by contributing nicely to the company's 668,000 increase in postpaid net adds during Q2).ConclusionFor those of you who may be considering a position in T-Mobile, I'd keep a watchful eye on a number of catalysts over the next 12-24 months as each could play a role in the company's long-term growth. For example, near-term investors should focus on the company's recent efforts behind its ""Uncarrier 3.0"" platform, while long-term investors should pay close attention to any changes in the company's market share behavior as well as any developments that may enhance the company's growth, such the potential for any merger-based activity.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in TMUS over the next 72 hours.

1600492,47731,2013-08-02T16:48:44-04:00,,"In a previous article I discussed the possibility of cell phone carriers no longer paying subsidies for new phones. The carriers took the first step towards this possibility a few months ago when they started offering no contract smartphone plans. Under these plans customers would pay full price for a new phone but would not be locked into a 2-year contract. They would also have lower monthly paymentsNow it appears the carriers have realized that consumers' main motivation for ditching contracts is the ability to upgrade their phone at any time. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are now offering an alternative for those who cannot stomach spending $600 up front for a phone but want to upgrade more often than every two years. T-Mobile was the first to offer one of these accelerated upgrade plans. AT&T and Verizon quickly announced competing plans within a week of T-Mobile's announcement. Sprint (NYSE:S) does not currently have a competing plan.In my previous article I concluded that T-Mobile gave customers the best value with its no-contract plan and should therefore see an increase in customers as a result. Let's do a similar analysis of the new upgrade plans to see which carrier will do best in the world of frequent upgrades.For this comparison I chose plans from each carrier that are as similar as possible. T-Mobile and Verizon have unlimited calling and texting with 2GB of data; the AT&T plan has 3GB of data (there is no 2GB option).So here is a breakdown of the new plans:Although Verizon and AT&T do not charge an extra fee to participate in the upgrade plan, their service plans are so much more expensive that the customer still ends up paying substantially more every month.T-Mobile's plan also includes insurance that covers accidental damage, loss or theft of your phone. Equivalent insurance costs $10/month from AT&T and $8/month from Verizon. This makes the price gap between the plans even greater.T-Mobile's plan also offers the most flexible upgrade schedule. After your first six months on the plan you can get your first upgrade, after that you can upgrade twice per year, not necessarily waiting six months between each upgrade. For example you could upgrade once after three months, then after nine months.Verizon makes customers wait six months after each upgrade before they can upgrade again. However, they also have to have paid off half the value of the phone, something that would take 12 months making normal payments.Finally AT&T will only allow customers to upgrade every 12 months.In conclusion T-Mobile has clearly won this round of the carrier wars. The competing plans from AT&T and Verizon are both significantly more expensive and less flexible.I would expect T-Mobile to gain some market share because of this plan. This should translate into long-term earnings growth and an increase in the share price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in TMUS over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

I'm bullish on the company because it is well positioned to take shares from other U.S. carriers. Also, the aggressive marketing, improved network experience and a full range of smartphones paint an encouraging outlook for the company. It also offers a significant potential for price appreciation of 8.9%.Financial Performance of 2Q'13 The company has managed to deliver a strong performance in the second quarter, with an increase of 11.5% QoQ in total revenues. After several quarters, TMUS has managed to add 688,000 postpaid subscribers because of cheap valuation plans and unlimited data services. The prepaid net additions have declined by 87,000 mainly because prepaid subscribers have switched to postpaid packages given the simpler plan choice. The company has experienced an all-time low churn rate of 1.58% with a decline of 16.8% QoQ. ARPU has experienced a decline of 0.9%, but I believe the second half of the year will experience the reverse in ARPU trends, as postpaid base subscribers migrate to voice plans. Also, the early upgrade plan will boost ARPU revenues, as 700,000 subscribers upgraded in the first month.TMUS has managed to sell 4.3 million smartphones, up by 95% QoQ. Higher smartphone penetration, including the iPhone, will help increase the subscriber base and ARPU. The 4G LTE network has been expanded to 157 POPs, and the company is expected to complete its launch to 200 POPs by the end of this year. Furthermore, TMUS is gearing up to pose a serious threat to other telecommunication giants, as shown by the porting ratios, which managed to improve against all carriers.Source: Company DataMargin ExpansionAs shown in the figure below, the company's margins are at a discount among its peer companies. With the acquisition of MetroPCS, there are several opportunities to unlock potential synergies by reducing the roaming and backhaul costs. These cost savings are estimated to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. Furthermore, the company has taken several other initiatives, such as enhancing communication lines with a higher capacity to enable the transfer of high data volumes with lower costs. Also, the company has managed to reduce employee-related costs by effectively managing call centers.

TMUS' share price has been up by 29.18% YTD, but I believe it still has the potential to grow because the company has successfully initiated its key strategies, such as integrating MetroPCS, the expansion of its LTE network and building a competitive product line-up.Risks With Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) gaining full control of its wireless segment and the massive investment of SoftBank in Sprint Corporation (NYSE:S), the industry is now very competitive.

1851931,55482,2013-11-20T10:36:42-05:00,,"The wireless consolidation is still not over. Among the latest acquisitions is Verizon's agreement to buyout longtime partner Vodafone's 45% share in Verizon Wireless. Just before this, we saw both Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) complete major consolidations with other telecom operators.While Sprint joined forces with Japanese wireless operator Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBY) and acquired Clearwire, T-Mobile closed its agreement with pay-as-you-go carrier MetroPCS. The third- and fourth-largest national carriers of the U.S. are trying to contest the two largest mobile operators, Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T). But this is not all.T-Mobile's CFO Braxton Carter says that he sees more wireless consolidations in the future. In fact, he went on to say that a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint is quite ""logical"" as it would strengthen competition in the U.S. wireless industry. However, when asked if the two national operators were in consolidation talks, the fourth-largest carrier declined to comment, which led to speculation regarding the possible merger. Sprint officials also kept quiet on this matter.Carter told Reuters that he sees this as the most ""logical ultimate consolidation."" This would be in the interest of the industry to shake the virtual duopoly of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and the AT&T by introducing a stronger third carrier. The question that arises is, will the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice allow such a merger deal to happen?Is the ""logical ultimate consolidation"" a tough proposal?It's now been approximately two years that the FCC and the DOJ blocked the $39 billion T-Mobile acquisition proposal made by the second-largest U.S. carrier, AT&T. The idea was to prevent any possibility of a monopoly and promote competition. In fact, the Kansas-based carrier was on the opposing side. Sprint's Chief Executive Dan Hesse expressed his concern that if AT&T acquired T-Mobile, it would further increase the Dallas-based carrier's market share and kill wireless competition.Although T-Mobile and Sprint have recently merged with other wireless entities, the big two are still way ahead. Carter agrees that further consolidation, particularly among national carriers, would be ""tough"" as the FCC isn't fond of big mergers; quite evident from the fate of the AT&T-T-Mobile deal.Also, the T-Mobile and Sprint merger could prove to be a risky step for both companies. Both have different networks and making the two networks compatible with one another is an expensive task. Sprint runs on CDMA while T-Mobile runs on GSM. Years back Sprint made a similar move when it acquired Nextel.However, Carter believes that consolidation between the smaller national carriers would make a bigger No. 3 carrier that will be able to effectively compete with the wireless biggies. Together, Verizon and AT&T enjoy over twice the subscriber strength of Sprint and T-Mobile. AT&T had 107 million subscribers, Verizon had 100 million, Sprint reported 53 million, while T-Mobile posted a subscriber base of 44 million earlier this year. So, if Sprint and T-Mobile combine, the consolidated entity would be able to contest the bigger rivals more aggressively.Both Sprint and T-Mobile are already posing challenges to their bigger rivals.Greater competitionAfter its merger with MetroPCS, T-Mobile has been fiercely competing with AT&T by introducing more attractive plans. In fact AT&T's Chief Executive Stephenson admits that the carrier is experiencing competition from T-Mobile's offering in the price sensitive markets.Both Sprint and T-Mobile were suffering from market share loss to the big two until they combined forces with other wireless operators. Now things have started turning in favor of the smaller players. T-Mobile's early smartphone upgrade program, Jump, particularly designed for the iPhone, is doing extremely well. Simultaneously, Sprint is also focusing on aggressive pricing strategy which will be driven by its 4G LTE rollout.The No. 3 and No. 4 carriers are offering really good deals for iPhone users as both are really keen on catching up with AT&T and Verizon. The upgrade program typically allows smartphone users to purchase the device and pay in monthly installments. The user can then upgrade the handset once in a year, (or six months as in case of T-Mobile) by exchanging the existing handset for the new one. Although the bigger carriers are also providing upgrade programs, they are not as attractive as Sprint's or T-Mobile's.T-Mobile's Jump plan costs $10 a month and applies to all its plans ranging from $50 to $70 a month. On the other hand, Sprint's One Up upgrade program comes for free. But there is a condition that the subscribers should be signed to its unlimited plan or the All-in plan. The carrier has given a $15 discount on the unlimited plan which brings down the monthly cost to a competitive $65.So we see that a number of steps are being taken by both T-Mobile and Sprint to regain market share and challenge AT&T and Verizon. So how attractive are these stocks?Are Sprint and T-Mobile worth considering?As far as Sprint is concerned, I would suggest only long term investors to take a look at it. Softbank's Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said that it would take about two years to turnaround Sprint's fortunes. The carrier's price-to-sales ratio is 0.85 compared to T-Mobile's 0.84, AT&T's 1.46 and Verizon's 1.22. This would be an attractive proposition for patient investors to consider the growth stock that suffered a setback post the Nextel acquisition.T-Mobile also looks like an interesting stock which could brighten investors' portfolio. The company is well positioned to attract customers from rival players and increase its subscriber base. After several quarters of lackluster growth, the carrier added 688,000 postpaid subscribers in the second quarter of 2013, thanks to its attractive low priced plans and unlimited data usage service. T-Mobile's revenue also increased 33.16% in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter.However, average revenue per user, or ARPU, fell 0.9%, but the second half of the year should give better results to the carrier as its early upgrade program is expected to boost the metric. The fourth-largest carrier is aggressively marketing, building its network and offering wide ranges of smartphones to cater to the subscriber needs and threaten larger players.ConclusionIndividually contesting the two majors would be a tough game. So the question of consolidation arises to create a more viable contender for these telecom giants. Carter is very optimistic about the potential of this merger and feels the FCC and other regulatory bodies won't block the deal, if and when it happens.However, such a step should be taken considering its pros and cons. I am sure Sprint would not like history to repeat itself with the network compatibility issue. It would be interesting to see how things proceed for Carter's ""logical combination"" proposal. Will it mature or disappear into thin air once again remains to be seen.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1340941,40141,2013-05-01T05:10:00-04:00,Rangeley Capital actively pushed for a better deal for PCS shareholders from DT.Here are the improved terms from DT and why we think that they are worth supporting.The new deal is worth over ten percent above PCS' standalone value.,"This is the follow up to T-Mobile's Bad Side: Too Much Debt and Too Little Equity for PCS. The improved deal for MetroPCS (PCS) from Deutsche Telekom AG (OTCQX:DTEGY) was welcome news for all PCS shareholders. The initial deal with DT was rebuffed by a significant number of shareholders. DT listened to the feedback from several investors that its offer was inadequate. After polling shareholders on what an acceptable deal would be, DT responded with an improved offer that should be acceptable to the majority of the shareholders. The new offer is very simple. It reduced the size of the debt funding from DT to the new company by $3.8 billion and reduced the interest rate to 6.5%. While this is not a sweetheart financing deal for the new company, it is in the competitive range in both size and interest rate relative to the other industry competitors. This eliminates one of the biggest deficiencies with their first offer. The original financing offer would have left the new company at an enduring disadvantage to its competitors in the market.The feedback from the shareholders to the original offer was that an acceptable offer needed to be at a significant premium to the stand-alone value. The original offer did not meet this test. PCS was not in trouble and they did not need to sell. The initial offer was asking the shareholders to move control of their company from a successful management team to a new company without gaining any benefit from the cost synergies that were discussed as a primary benefit of the deal. Our analysis valued a stand-alone PCS at about $12 per share. The original offer from DT was worth less. Using the same model, the new financing arrangement yields a value of $13.36 per share. This represents a premium to the standalone value of 11%. While this new offer is not rich, it should clearly be acceptable to the majority of the stockholders.Chart #1 shows the derivation of the 2012 pro forma results for the new company based on both companies' reported actual financial results for the 2012 reported period. The share value is based on a perpetual growth model using the net after tax profit, 3% growth rate, and no synergies. The result is an estimated share value of $13.36 per share.This improved offer for PCS creates more economic value for both sets of shareholders and results in a combined company that is significantly more competitive in the marketplace. It was the willingness of shareholders to speak out and the management's to listen that drove this result.What's next? Earlier this month, we discussed the possibility of DISH launching a competing bid for PCS (How Charlie Ergen Can Shake Up The World Of M&A In 2013). With the revised deal for PCS, it is now more likely that DISH will simply wait for the T-Mobile/PCS deal to close and then launch a bid for the new company. More news to come and still a few more dollars to make.Disclosure: The author is long TMUS. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

1547302,22445,2013-07-13T08:33:26-04:00,,"T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is rolling out a new program on July 14 that will take the carrier industry by storm. The company with its Jump! program will permit T-Mobile customers to upgrade to new devices twice a year rather than once every two years. For $10 a month, customers who enroll in the program have the option to upgrade their phone device twice a year, beginning six months after they enroll.T-Mobile put an end to carrier subsidies with their ""uncarrier"" approach to cellular service plans earlier this year. Many other carriers have had to respond with big discounts and special plans in order to catch up and compete. Just several days ago, Sprint cut its prices on unlimited plans and pressure has been building on other carriers to follow.T-Mobile's approach seems to be working and consumers have responded positively. According to Bloomberg, after three years of losing customers, T-Mobile finally gained subscribers in the latest quarter. In addition to Jump!, T-Mobile announced that its 4G LTE network now reaches 157 million people and is live in 116 metropolitan areas. The company debuted 4G LTE less than four months ago, and remains on target to deliver nationwide 4G LTE network coverage by the end of the year, reaching 200 million people in more than 200 metropolitan areas.What this means for carriersIn essence, T-Mobile just declared a price war on the three other major carriers, Sprint (NYSE:S), AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). The implications of T-Mobile's plan to gain customers will have significant implications to carriers who have not yet adapted to this new trend, or will not adapt to it fast enough. The new trend being that more and more people are responding positively to a no frills plan, with no long-term contract and a lower monthly bill, providing they pay for their device.More or less this is nothing different than what is going on in the rest of the world. More and more people around the world are buying their devices for cash and use the cheapest carrier service possible. The U.S. is going in the same direction and eventually more and more consumers will have carrier service with no contract at all.On Friday all major carriers trended lower, with Sprint in a free-fall, closing down by more than 7.5%. I think that eventually all major carriers will be impacted negatively by T-Mobile's new competitive approach. Both margins and revenue will be impacted and all major carriers will feel the pinch. As such, I either recommend selling all the major carriers, or selling them short if you get confirmation of technical weakness.On the other hand, T-Mobile might benefit because it has already been coping with lower margins and has bleeding customers for several years now. So they have adapted to the new model and will probably be the main beneficiaries.Will device makers be affected?As for device makers, the current trend is that consumers are buying lower priced devices. This is one of the reasons why Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is having such a hard time. If subsidies -- as a result of this price war that T-Mobile started -- will be reduced or gone away with, the device makers that have most to lose will be the high-end device makers. I think the bells are tolling mostly for Apple and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF).In fact for Apple even more so, because to date Apple still has not rolled out a lower priced device to compete for those consumers that either can't afford a high-end smartphone (like the Apple iPhone 5 or the Samsung Galaxy S4) or don't want to spend all that money on a smartphone device anyway.On the bright side, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and BlackBerry (BBRY) have many lower priced devices and already sell and compete in many countries around the world where consumers pay for their devices in cash. So as far as the rest of the world, Nokia and BlackBerry will not be affected.In developed markets, however (such as the U.S.), Nokia and BlackBerry will be also be impacted. According to the NPD Group, in the first quarter of 2013, y-o-y total smartphone sales increased 42 percent, with one-third (36 percent) of the actual unit volume increase represented by prepaid smartphone sales. Prepaid means without a contract, or the business model that T-Mobile is pursuing.But I think Nokia will be impacted more than BlackBerry. BlackBerry is also an enterprise device that Nokia is not. So while individuals might not buy a Lumia 920 because of the cost, corporations are not as price sensitive.There is a bright side for device makers however. Because consumers will have the option to upgrade devices every six months (and I am sure almost all of them will exercise this option), it means more sales for all device makers. Yes margins will fall, but device makers will probably make up for lost profits from increased device sales. In other words, there will be more smartphone churning.And because of this high churning, it will also be interesting to see how consumers respond to device trends. For example, let's say you buy a Nokia Lumia 920 but don't like it all that much. After six months you can upgrade to a BlackBerry Z10 to try it out. So I also think it will be an opportunity for BlackBerry, that has the lowest penetration today, to prove itself, since more and more people in the future will have a chance to try out BlackBerry devices, whereas today most would not even contemplate of buying one.Bottom lineT-Mobile's aggressive stance in the space will lower margins and EPS for all major carriers. As such and as a precaution, I advise selling all three major carriers, Sprint, AT&T and Verizon. I think once the market models in the repercussions of T-Mobile's aggressive strategy, we will see downgrades in the sector across the board. On the other hand, I think T-Mobile will benefit.As for device makers, I think they will also be affected, with Apple and Samsung more than Nokia and BlackBerry. As for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), for the time being they are too small of a device maker to make a difference. However, I think they have the chance to adapt better than most, so I think they might actually benefit as a result also.But in order for us to be able to get a handle on the repercussions of T-Mobile's strategy, several months have to go by. In the mean time, it will be interesting to see how the major mobile carriers adapt to this new wave of competitive pressure from T-Mobile and what counter-measure they will take.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1305781,40141,2013-03-30T19:48:31-04:00,The terms of DT's original deal with PCS were not worthy of PCS shareholder support.Rangeley Capital opposed the original deal and actively expressed our view to DT management.Here is why the deal is worse than no deal but could be improved so that it is worth supporting.,"T-Mobile has shown its bad side with its efforts to acquire MetroPCS (PCS), underpaying for the PCS spectrum while leaving the remaining company undercapitalized, all to the benefit of Deutsche Telekom (OTCPK:DTEGF).T-Mobile is offering PCS shareholders cash from PCS' own balance sheet and a 26% equity stake of the new debt-laden company led by a management team that has not been able to break their own free fall. What is the Board of PCS thinking, and what should shareholders do?Since the announcement of the deal, the market is up over 7% while PCS is down over 10%, and PCS' EV/LTM EBITDA multiples are now beneath industry peers. It's clear that the market does not think this is a value creating transaction for PCS, and we agree.EV/ LTM EBITDAToo Much Debt at Too High a CostThe new company will be hobbled with 3.6x pro forma EBITDA leverage, which will make it uncompetitive compared to the less levered Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Sprint (NYSE:S), and AT&T (NYSE:T).Net Debt/2013e EBITDANot only is PCS forced to take on a too much unnecessary debt, but Deutsche Telekom is a loan shark, charging them 7% on $15 billion of intercompany debt, far above what similarly rated companies have to pay. In comparison, this is a third more than Sprint pays on their debt. This 2.8% difference in interest rates would be a durable competitive disadvantage for the combined company after this deal.Yield to Maturity on Corporate DebtNot Enough EquityPCS is growing EBITDA at around 14% while T-Mobile is shrinking EBITDA at about 8%.PCS shareholders are being asked to contribute over 40% of the pro forma company's value in return for about a quarter of the pro forma company's equity.Preceding charts from Paulson & Co. Inc.When Wall Street wants to get a deal done, they ignore actual historic performance and move into the make-believe realm of forecasts and projections as though they have actually happened. We believe the best reflection of the potential of a company and its management team is what they have done, not necessarily speculating on what they will do. One can gain much more reliable insight into the strength of a company by looking at the actual financial performance for the last several years.To bring some sanity back to this proposed deal, we find a pro forma of the deal based on 2012 actual financial performance to be instructive. The following chart illustrates the actual reported results for the two companies for 2011 and 2012 followed by a pro forma column that models the proposed deal using the 2012 actual results instead of the net present value of financial projections. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.Actual Reported Financial Performance chart from Rangeley CapitalThe first observation is that these are two companies are going in very different directions. PCS is growing revenue while T-Mobile is decreasing revenue at an increasing rate. PCS has a return on net assets that is roughly double their cost of borrowing. It is a business that yields a substantial ROE when leveraged. T-Mobile has a return on net assets below the 7% borrowing rate offered in the deal for the combined company. Based on the latest actual performance, PCS will be a net value add to the business while T-Mobile will be a net value destroyer. Still, the deal calls for PCS shareholders to cede control and only get 26% of the equity in the new company despite the proven value that they are bringing to the table.The second observation is that PCS shows improving margins from 2011 to 2012 for both operating income as well as return on net assets. T-Mobile, on the other hand, has lower margins on an accelerating reduction in revenue. This yields a reduction of operating margin of 1.5 pts to 10.7%, which is two-thirds of the PCS operating margin. T-Mobile's return on net assets would have dropped to 4.8% had they not cleverly written off $8.1 billion dollars of goodwill in 2012. This write-off represents overpaying for assets in the past by over twice the entire current market value of PCS. This is on top of a write-off of $6.4 billion in 2011. If history is our guide, any goodwill associated with PCS will be written off within a few years.What is a fair deal based on actual performance?The pro forma for 2012 reflecting the current proposal yields a net after tax income for the combined businesses of $967M without giving effect of any synergies. PCS is the source of $394M or 41% of this value. Doing the same exercise using 2011 actual results indicates that last year a fair deal would have been a 26% ownership share for PCS, unfortunately for T-Mobile, the PCS management team has blown by them while they were deciding what to write off next.The only conclusion that can be reached from the actual performance of these two companies is that for a deal to be fair to the current PCS shareholders, they need to get in excess of 40% of the economic value of the combined company and the PCS management team needs to run the show. The letter the Board wrote to shareholders on March 25, 2013 did little to help shed light or justify their reasoning to go through with a deal that so clearly undervalues the business. How the PCS board can support the current deal remains a mystery to us.Where do we stand today?The deal secured Department of Justice (DoJ) approval on March 5, 2013 after a review that lasted over one hundred days. It is not subject to European Union (EU) review. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the deal on March 12, 2013. CFIUS approval was secured on March 21, 2013. So, the process of closing a deal could be quick and easy… as soon as there is a deal worth closing. The remaining decision sits with PCS shareholders, and so far, over 12% of shareholders have declared their opposition to the deal, and there are almost certainly at least another 3% that are opposed for a total count of about 15%. Within what I would consider a standard process, 15% is a very high percentage of shareholders to be against a deal going into a proxy vote.On Friday, April 12, 2013, we'll find out what shareholders decide and if Deutsche Telekom comes back with a better offer. We estimate that there is a 20% chance of the deal getting approval in its current form, which is worth around $9.60 per share. This is the worst case outcome for shareholders. We assign about a 5% chance that the deal is turned down and T-Mobile walks away. On a standalone basis, we value PCS at $12.10 per share, a substantial premium to the current deal price. We believe the most likely outcome, roughly a 75% chance, is that the deal is revised upward to a reasonable premium over the standalone value of PCS, which we put at $13-14 per share. So the expected value of PCS equity is about $13, a 20% premium to the cost of its shares today.What could T-Mobile do to get this deal done?They could bump the deal price by reducing intercompany debt and lowering the interest rate so that the pro forma leverage would be comparable in size and expense to their competitors. Alternatively, they could simply offer more cash or stock. Either way, PCS shareholders own a valuable business that deserves more than they are being offered.Good T-Mobile -- Getting themselves out of trouble by buying PCSBad T-Mobile -- Low price for PCS and high debt burdenDisclosure: The author is long TMUS.

969161,29461,2012-11-01T13:57:01-04:00,,"The largest pay as you go telecom carrier in the United States, MetroPCS (PCS) Communications Inc., recently reported its third quarter results. Results were impressive as the company more than doubled its bottom line from the same quarter last year. The company posted earnings per share of $0.52 on revenues of $1.26 billion. Both revenues and earnings grew, by 5% and 177%, respectively. The company ended the quarter beating estimates for both revenues and earnings. Third quarter revenues of $1.26 billion beat revenue estimates of $1.25, whereas, PCS beat earnings estimate by a comfortable margin of $0.26. Despite the fact that earnings were helped by a $53 million gain on sale of certain securities, the company would have still beaten the EPS estimates by a margin of $0.19 per share after excluding the effects of the said sale of securities.MetroPCS, which provides flat rate services to its customers and does not require contracts, has shown an impressive growth in revenues in recent quarters. Launching a 4G network with wider coverage and offering a wider range of smartphones has helped attract new customers for the company. Moreover, despite its business model being based on the less predictable prepaid segment of the market, it has done well to report a lower churn in recent quarters, which is showing a downward trend. Churn, the percentage of subscribers leaving the network, was reported to be 3.7%. Even though this is much higher than what other telecom carriers in the region have reported because of the reasons mentioned above, it is a substantial decrease from the third quarter churn of 4.5%. With price wars among wireless players becoming fiercer, PCS has done exceptionally well with its service plans, and that has helped it report a lower churn. The company's recently announced 4G data plan has done particularly well and is currently the only plan on offer that provides unlimited data, along with features such as no annual contract required.The company's faster 4G service is gaining traction among customers, and it currently has more than a million subscribers using its LTE services. A total of 700,000 customers were using the company's LTE services in the second quarter. Currently, a total of 12% of its total customers are using its 4G services, up from 8% by the end of the second quarter.Other key features of the company's quarterly results are as follows:The company has recently announced that it will merge its operations with T-Mobile. In our previous report, we mentioned the various operational and financial benefits for the company in the post merger scenario. We believe that in addition to a significant expansion in its customer base, the company will achieve operational scale, wider coverage and wider range of handsets, which will eventually help it bring back customer growth.PCS is trading at 7 times its earnings, at a discount to the industry multiple of 16x. On a forward P/E basis, PCS is trading at 14 times its earnings while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is trading at 15.7x. Valuations for PCS suggest that the stock is currently undervalued.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Telecom Analyst.

1347741,24389,2013-04-17T10:51:46-04:00,,"MetroPCS (PCS) received an enhanced offer in the proposed merger with T-mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG (OTCQX:DTEGY). The main highlight of the amended proposal is the interest rate reduction on the new firm's debt to Deutsche Telecom. Debt of the combined company will be reduced by $3 billion. The lock up period for DTEGY-owned stock will also be extended.If approved, MetroPCS shareholders will receive $4.06 per share, plus 26 percent of the new company. The previous proposal was met with strong opposition from major stockholders due to unfavorable terms. Deutsche Telecom put some spices on its proposal to make it look good, and the new one seems better. On April 15, the board of PCS unanimously approved the amended terms.The proposed merger of PCS with T-mobile is definitely not a result of weakening financials. It is, in fact, a strategic move to strengthen the position of both companies in the relatively competitive wireless market.PCS and T-mobile Merger Creates a Stronger CompanyThe merger of PCS and T-mobile will create a company that is much stronger and tougher for competitors to beat. Their combined strength will make the new company a leading value carrier in the wireless market of the U.S. In its presentation to the investors, PCS expected a 7% to 10% growth in EBITDA CAGR. It further projected that the cost synergies from enhanced scale and scope will be around $6 billion to $7 billion.With regards to market share, the new company will obviously have an improved rank. In Q2 of 2012, PCS was ranked No. 3 in the branded no-contract subscribers market where Tracfone dominates. Tracfone has about 21.3 million subscribers. In the second spot was Sprint Nextel Corporation (NYSE:S) with approximately 15.4 million subscribers.PCS was third with 9.3 million subscribers. Behind PCS were AT&T (NYSE:T), Leap Wireless International (NYSE:LEAP), and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). T-mobile ranked number 7 with about 5.3 million subscribers. With the merger, the new company will still be ranked the same with PCS at the 3rd spot. However, it will move closer to Sprint in the second spot with 14.6 million combined numbers of subscribers.But in terms of total revenues, the new company will have a commanding lead in the branded no-contract market. In the second quarter of 2012, MetroPCS and Sprint are tied at the No. 1 spot. Both companies have revenue amounting to $1.2 billion. Tracfone was only second with $1 billion in revenue, while LEAP and T-mobile have $0.8 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively.Based on the 2nd-quarter performance, the new company will dominate with combined revenue amounting to $1.6 billion. While the present scenario is different, the situation will be somewhat the same with respect to revenue and subscriber ranking. Therefore, the merger proves to be for the advantage of both companies.PCS Financials and Subscriber PerformancePCS has a pretty impressive income statement and balance sheets, but its cash flow is disappointing. Total revenue in the past two years has  increased from $4.847 billion in 2011 to $5.101 billion in 2012.Consequently, net income also improved. 2011 performance showed earnings at $301.31 million, up by a staggering 55.78% from $193.41 million in 2010. The fiscal year 2012 also saw an increase in net income at $394.17 million but with a modest growth of 30.81%. The company recorded the highest adjusted EBITDA of all time at $1.5 billion with 14% growth versus the prior year. Consequently, the diluted earnings per share also increased from $0.82 to $1.07 in 2011 and 2012, respectively.While PCS earnings performances were good, it has failed to achieve an impressive performance in debt management. Total liabilities were slightly up from $6.555 billion in 2011 to $6.830 billion in 2012; an increase by 4.19%. The company ended the year 2012 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.368 billion. However, under the recently amended agreement, the combined company will have a lowered debt exposure. Debt will be reduced by $3.8 billion, thereby giving the combined company better financial flexibility.In terms of subscriber reach in the 4G LTE market, 2012 was a turning point for PCS. The number of 4G LTE subscribers dramatically jumped from only 310,000 in 2011 to 2.2 million. This is a whopping 609% increase.Other significant highlights in 2012 include the launch of commercially available Voice Over LTE service, which was the first worldwide. PCS also launched other 4G LTE smartphones like Samsung Galaxy SIII, ZTE Avid, LG Motion, Huawei Activa and more.PCS today has a market capitalization of $4.07 billion. This is way below the market capitalization of industry giants. AT&T has a market cap of $208.35 billion; Verizon comes next with $144.23 billion, followed by Vodafone with $143.85 billion. DETGY, on the other hand, has a market capitalization of $49.93 billion.PCS currently supports a P/E ratio of 10.33, slightly lower than the industry P/E ratio of 14.27 and well below the S&P 500 P/E ratio of 17.7. The majority of the analyst firms assessed PCS as hold, while a few voted for buy.Stock PerformanceFor the fiscal year 2013, PCS has an upbeat performance. The share prices have gained 20.6% in the past three months and 13.2% year to date. The closing price on April 16, was $11.05 per share. This slightly exceeds the median target price of $11, according Yahoo Finance. However, the high target set at $18 seems possible, considering that this level was attained two years ago.Final NotesBack in 2011, AT&T attempted to acquire T-Mobile for a deal worth $39 billion. While, the deal was not completed, it gives us an estimate of T-Mobile's current valuation. Assuming that T-Mobile is still worth what AT&T has offered for it, the deal looks like a very sweet one for PCS shareholders.With the PCS approval on the proposed merger, I expect the prices to keep rising in the future. The strengthened financial position of the combined company can lead PCS shareholders to higher happiness levels. Company performance is also strong in earnings and revenue growth. Consequently, the recent recommendations are shifting from hold to buy. Hudson Square recently upgraded PCS to buy with a target of $14. Based on a modest 10% growth, my FED+ valuation also suggests a minimum target of $13. Thus, the stock has at least 20% upside potential even if the merger does not get approved.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in PCS over the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Efsinvestment is a team of analysts.

The wireless broadband mobile communication provider in a range of US metropolitan areas, is now openly ""in play"". In Tuesday the company reached an agreement with T-Mobile USA, but later in the week reports surfaced that competitor Sprint Nextel (NYSE:S) might make an offer for MetroPCS as well.Shares of MetroPCS traded between $11-$14 per share during last week as a range of rumors hit the market about possible deals.The RumorsOn Tuesday reports hit the market that Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) was in talks with MetroPCS Communications. Speculation about a possible tie-up already hit the market after T-Mobile USA sold 7,200 towers to Crown Castle International for $2.4 billion last week. The deal with Crown Castle gave T-Mobile USA more financial resources to make a possible deal.Under a proposed agreement, Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile USA unit would merge with MetroPCS in a deal giving the Germans a 74% stake in the new company. MetroPCS's shareholders would receive the remainder 26% of the shares and $1.5 billion in cash.Last year the $39 billion deal to sell T-Mobile USA to AT&T was dropped on anti-trust concerns. From that point in time, Deutsche Telekom has been anxiously exploring options for its troubled US unit.A merger of T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS would still lag behind Verizon Wireless (VZ), AT&T (T) and Sprint Nextel (S). Combined, the combination would be the fourth largest US carrier with annual sales of $24.8 billion and 42.5 million subscribers.No Transformational Deal - Industry Landscape will not changeA possible deal between the two companies would not be a transformational deal. T-Mobile's 33.2 million subscribers and the 9.3 million subscriber base from MetroPCS would result in a new carrier with 42.5 million subscribers. Despite the deal, the combination would still rank number four, behind Sprint Nextel which has 56 million subscribers. AT&T and Verizon Wireless are still leading the market, with subscriber bases around the 100 million mark.While a deal would not change the competitive landscape, it would provide significant synergies. Deutsche Telekom estimates that annual costs synergies could range from $1.2-$1.5 billion. The carrier would get access to more popular handsets and have network costs benefits. T-Mobile is the only large US carrier still excluded from Apple's (AAPL) iPhone. The lack of iPhone offerings, has resulted in a roughly 10% decline in the customer base over the past two years. Contrary to common post-paid contracts, MetroPCS offers no-contract, pay-as-you-go phones.The details of a possible deal indicate that T-Mobile USA is serious about a possible deal. The deal values T-Mobile USA at $26 billion according to some analysts, down a third from the deal value of $39 billion offered by AT&T. In recent quarters, the company has already taken billion dollar write-downs on its US assets.The company's have agreed on break-up fees in their negotiations. If T-Mobile breaks up the talks it will pay $250 million to MetroPCS, while the latter will pay $150 million to T-Mobile in case it breaks up the talks. Deutsche Telekom already received a massive $3 billion break-up payment when the deal with AT&T collapsed.Sprint As A Possible Third Party?CEO Dan Hesse of Sprint, the third largest US carrier, said the board of Sprint is meeting for the second time this year to evaluate a possible acquisition of MetroPCS. A possible deal between T-Mobile and MetroPCS would threaten its position as the third largest carrier.In February of this year, Sprint Nextel's board rejected a possible deal with MetroPCS as the deal was too costly. Sprint, which is saddled with a net debt position of roughly $15 billion, most likely had to use its own stock to make a deal with MetroPCS Communication. Back in February, shares of Sprint Nextel were valued at just $2.30 per share, or $7 billion.Shares more than doubled from that point in time to $5.20 per share at the moment, valuing the equity at almost $16 billion. A possible deal with MetroPCS would be much less dilutive to Sprint Nextel shareholders at today's prices.Despite a recovery in Sprint's share price, T-Mobile USA, backed by its parent company in Germany has superior financial ammunition.ConclusionMetroPCS is once again the target of consolidation activity in the US wireless mobile landscape. This time it is almost certain that some form of consolidation will take place, but the exact outcome is still unknown. The fact that T-Mobile USA remains committed to do a deal, has the most financial resources, and has initiated the consolidation talks, gives the company some key advantages over Sprint Nextel. If a deal between T-Mobile and MetroPCS will not take place, T-Mobile stands to receive a break-up fee for the second time.While it is unclear which carrier get's away with MetroPCS's operations, it is clear that investors in MetroPCS are the clear winner. At a closing price of $12.65, shares are up 45% for the year. Shares more than doubled from their lows in June of this year. Long term investors probably disagree as shares are still trading 50% below levels in 2007. A substantial premium in a deal would ease some of the pain.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

902791,29461,2012-10-03T13:57:48-04:00,,"The shares of MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) jumped almost 18% on the news of a possible merger with Deutsche Telekom's (OTCQX:DTEGY) T-Mobile yesterday, and it has recently been confirmed that the respective boards of both companies have approved the merger. Today, the stock fell by 9%. Under the terms of the deal, PCS will make 1 for 2 reverse stock split, and make a payment of $1.5 billion in cash to its shareholders. According to Reuters both DTEG and PCS want to list the combined entity on the stock exchange post-merger, giving DTEG a 74% stake in the combined entity, with the remaining stake belonging to PCS. Moreover, the German company has also agreed to provide the merged company with a $500 million credit facility. The transaction, which is expected to be concluded in the first half of next year, is subject to regulatory approval; however, it is unlikely that it will face too much resistance considering the deal wouldn't lead to excessive concentration of power, as the combined entity will still not have a market share greater than Sprint (NYSE:S), the third largest U.S. telecom operator.Operational BenefitsThis deal can be looked at positively in a number of ways. T-Mobile is the fourth-largest telecom carrier operating in the U.S. in terms of number of subscribers, and as at the end of second quarter, 2012, it had a total of 33.2 million subscribers, out of which 21.3 million were postpaid subscribers. PCS, which only caters to the prepaid segment of the market, ended the second quarter with 9.29 million customers. With both companies combining, the merged enterprise will definitely become a stronger competitor to other operators, while still lagging behind them in terms of subscriber numbers.The combined company will also gain more airwaves and a wider LTE network to provide more coverage and high speed to its customers. Even though PCS has lost customers to bigger rivals Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) due to their greater market coverage and customer demand for high speed 4G services, PCS customer cancellations are on the decline, and more and more customers are switching to its 4G services. Moreover, competition among telecom carriers in terms of various plans and services on offer has become fierce over time, and both T-mobile and PCS have done well to compete with their bigger rivals. In fact, both PCS and T-Mobile are currently offering the cheapest 4G data plans, which include services like no contract requirement, unlimited data, text and voice, which can bring customer growth going forward.Financial BenefitsApart from operational benefits, both companies are expecting significant financial benefits as well. According to the press release, the company is expecting to generate a 5-year revenue CAGR of somewhere between 3%-to-5% as well as free cash flow growth of 15%-to-20%. Cost synergies of $6 billion-to-$7 billion are also expected from the deal, on top of the synergies expected from revenue growth. Moreover, the combined company will also have direct access to the debt and equity markets in the U.S., giving it further financial flexibility.Overall, we believe the merger between T-Mobile and PCS will bring substantial synergies as the network capital expenditures requirements might be reduced. Moreover, the combined company will gain operational scale in terms of wider network coverage, wider range of handsets, as well as new territories to offer its cheaper unlimited plans. And as far as the telecom industry consolidation is concerned, this will certainly help increase the combined market share of the two companies, enabling them to become stronger rivals to larger companies like Sprint and Verizon.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Telecom Analyst.

886911,29461,2012-09-25T07:39:04-04:00,,"Shares of 'pay as you go' telecom carrier, MetroPCS Communications (PCS), have had a dream run since our last report on the company, and have gained over 80%. Despite the stock trading close to its 52-week high of $12.5, we reiterate our previous stance on the stock. We are bullish on the company based on its consistent revenue growth, which has reflected positively in its earnings growth, a consistent increase in ARPU, as well as improving churn, despite the absence of contract requirements.As mentioned previously, the company has been posting good financials, despite losing customers along the way largely due to its weaker presence in the next generation network buildout. It has lost customers to carriers like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) due to the customer expectations for high speed 4G services, and the much higher market coverage (almost 400 markets for Verizon) is hurting the 'pay as you go' carrier. However, the recent statement given by the company's chief executive, Roger Linquist, at an investor conference, was taken on rather positively by the market. He had mentioned that customer cancellations were on the decline in the third quarter, and more and more customers were using the company's services for their data needs. A similar sort of announcement was made when the company announced its second quarter results, claiming that subscribers are ""flocking"" to its faster 4G services. The company also said that almost 8% of its subscribers were on 4G LTE services by the end of the second quarter. Interesting to see will be how far up that number has gone now that we approach the end of the third quarter. The price wars among telecom carriers have become fierce, and MetroPCS has done well to keep up in terms of its various service plans. Recently, it announced its $55 unlimited 4G plan, which is by far the cheapest among other carriers, and it comes with other facilities like no contracts required and no activation fees. And of course, PCS and Sprint (NYSE:S) share the crown for offering unlimited data to their customers. The plan, even though promotional and available for a limited time only, will definitely help boost its customer numbers, as well as customer retention.www.metropcs.comThe reason cited for the 186,000 customer losses was that the company had focused more on generating EBITDA, as opposed to customer growth, which is exactly what happened, with the company generating an EBITDA growth of almost 35% in the quarter recently ended. However, in the third quarter, we expect the customer numbers to improve as well, with its cheaper plans and 4G rollout nearing completion. Average revenues per user have been consistently rising, with the company reporting a quarter ARPU of $40.62, versus 2Q2011's ARPU of $40.4. Even though the company has a higher churn than other telecom carriers due to the absence of long term contract requirements, it posted a healthy 50 basis point drop in churn in the second quarter.Roger Linquist's comments on declining customer cancellations may be well founded, and we will soon know for sure when the company announces its quarterly results in the coming days. We believe the company's unlimited data offerings at cheaper rates will benefit PCS going forward, considering that other carriers are phasing out such offers. The stock is trading at cheap valuations as reflected in its low P/E multiple of 13x, as compared to its five-year median forward P/E of 15x. The stock is also undervalued based on its P/S multiple of 0.85x as compared to the industry's 1.3x and Verizon's 1.15x.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Telecom Analyst.

854231,29461,2012-09-07T17:25:09-04:00,,"MetroPCS Communications, Inc., (PCS), a pay as you go telecom operator, had an impressive second quarter despite posting a net subscriber loss. The company posted earnings that grew by over 75% in the quarter. Reported EPS was 41 cents, while analysts were expecting EPS of 21 cents. There was a healthy improvement of 6% in revenues as well, with improvements seen in average revenues per user and churn rate. Perhaps these strong results have reflected in its stock price, which has shown an upward trend since the announcement of its second quarter results. Since our last report on PCS, the stock is up 55%. We previously recommended a long position on the stock, and we reiterate our previous stance.The company recently launched its latest unlimited LTE data plan, which is going to cost customers $55 per month. This move has come after other telecom operators like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) announced their service plans in attempts to lure bandwidth-hungry smartphone users. However, PCS has taken its promotional efforts one step further. Even though Verizon is offering unlimited plans at a lesser price than PCS, these unlimited plans are being offered on basic mobile devices and not on smartphones. Verizon is currently charging $30 per month for 2GB data and $80 for 10GB. On the other hand, PCS's cheapest unlimited talk, text and data plan is only $40 per month. PCS has offered another deal to families, which have to pay only $50 more per month if they get the second, third and fourth lines under its unlimited LTE plan. Moreover, the family plan will also carry unlimited talk, text and data features, which is a huge advantage not only for customers, but also for the company, as it will likely help the company recover from its subscriber losses in the quarter recently ended. PCS has also thrown in an LTE Android smartphone, the LG motion 4G, for $149 as part of its promotion strategy.The company has recently launched the Coolpad Quattro 4G, which is going for $149 at its stores. It is the company's cheapest 4G LTE smartphone, which can be used with its various service plans, with all the taxes and fees included and of course, with no annual contract. The company had announced previously that it will launch more smartphones in the second half of the year. It has done exactly that with the launch of its coolpad Quattro, as well as the LG motion. Previously, the company had tremendous success with its $25 unlimited voice and texting plan, which was also the lowest price point at which the company had offered services to its customers.PCS has become the first U.S. telecom operator to launch a voice-over LTE device. In a recent press release, the company announced that its LG connect smartphone will be on VoLTE support. However, the newly-launched service will only work on new LG handsets, and the company has also said that it plans to introduce more voice-over LTE phones in the second half of the year. The rollout of the VoLTE will allow the company to transfer voice traffic to its near-completed LTE network. The advantage of this new technology for consumers will be clearer calls as well as shorter connection periods. PCS has taken the lead once again, as Verizon and AT&T will not be deploying the technology until 2013.In terms of financials, PCS is a growth story, as its revenues have grown at a CAGR of over 20% since the financial year ended 2007. Gross margins have remained around 40% despite the slow pace of the economy, which is an indication of its operational strength. Moreover, the company's gross margins have remained stable in times when other operators like AT&T and Verizon were experiencing a contraction in their margins. It has also been able to grow its earnings by over 30% over the last four years. The second quarter ended with improvements in almost all key business metrics, including average revenue per user, which jumped to $40.6 from $40.4 in 2Q2012, as well as churn, which decreased from 3.9% to 3.4%.The stock is trading at 11 times its earnings, at a discount to the industry multiple of 16x, as well its five-year median forward P/E of 14.5x. On a forward P/E basis, PCS is trading at 13 times its earnings, while Verizon and AT&T are trading at 15.6x and 14.5x respectively. Valuations for PCS suggest the stock is currently undervalued.

902501,22110,2012-10-03T12:24:21-04:00,,"Since having its $39b sale of T-Mobile USA to AT&T (NYSE:T) nixed on antitrust grounds, Deutsche Telekom AG (DTGEY.PK) has been trying to figure out another way to exit the U.S. market.Today DT announced that its U.S. subsidiary (No. 4 with 33.2 million subs) will be merged with the No. 5 US carrier, MetroPCS (PCS) (with 9.3 million subs). The press release is here and the story is covered by Fierce Wireless (among many others).It's being called a ""merger"" but it's clearly an acquisition (structured as a recapitalization), since T-Mobile USA will retain its name, technology, HQ and CEO - while MetroPCS will lose all four. It will retain its NYSE stock listing but presumably not its PCS ticker.Although the cash payout is only $1.5b - funded by a $2.4b sale/leaseback of T-Mobile USA towers - MetroPCS shareholders will own 26% share of the new company. I haven't seen any estimate of the value of the acquisition. The market suggests that the cash only accounts for one third of the value: today MetroPCS has a market cap (on inter-day trading) of about $4.5b, vs. $4.2b yesterday and $3.5b a month ago.So instead of being paid $39b to exit, DT is paying $1.5b cash to build up a more stable company. I would presume that DT hopes that it will be able to gradually unload its 74% holding in the combined company through open market sales.The two companies will be run as separate operations until T-Mobile can get all MetroPCS customers to phase out their CDMA handsets in favor of GSM ones. At today's press conference, T-Mobile said it hopes to pull the plug on the MetroPCS network by the end of 2015. In the meantime, T-Mobile gets cheap LTE spectrum that both types of customers can share as the CDMA voice footprint goes down and the GSM voice footprint goes up. Or perhaps both end up on VoIP, i.e. VoLTE, which MetroPCS announced it plans to introduce in 14 US markets by early next year.The acquisition puts pressure on No. 3 Sprint (NYSE:S) (56.4 million subs), which was a more obvious buyer for MetroPCS (which would have avoided the disastrous technology incompatibilities of its Nextel purchase). But so far, Sprint shareholders seem not to have reacted (either way) to the news.One thing I haven't seen mentioned: This is the merger of the iPhone outsiders: the #1, #2 and #3 carriers have the iPhone but #4 and #5 do not. Perhaps this will make Sprint want to buy the #6 carrier (which does have the iPhone): San Diego's Leap Wireless (NYSE:LEAP) which has 5.9m subscribers on its Cricket network.However, the two hitches are technology and pride. Sprint is migrating its 4G strategy from WiMax to LTE, while Cricket uses TD-LTE, the Chinese variant not used by the top 5 carriers. (However, Cricket only offers LTE service in Tuscon right now, so perhaps it could drop the incompatible LTE if its acquired soon).The other problem is that Leap turned down acquisition efforts by MetroPCS since 2007. Perhaps it's due to bad blood between the companies that wouldn't apply to Sprint, or perhaps Leap will realize that it lacks scale to operate its own network indefinitely in an ever-commoditized market."
757161,29461,2012-07-27T14:00:37-04:00,,"MetroPCS Communications (PCS), a wireless telecom company, announced its quarterly results on July 26. Since the announcement, the stock has appreciated almost 37%, closing at $8.59 on Thursday. PCS posted EPS of 41 cents, beating consensus estimates of $0.21 by a comfortable margin. Total revenues showed an improvement of 6% compared to the second quarter of the prior year, also beating consensus estimates of $1.26 billion, albeit by a small margin.The second quarter ended with a very healthy earnings surprise of 95%. Net income for the company rose almost 77% compared to the same quarter of the previous year. The latest quarterly results were largely helped by service revenues, which grew by 4% from Q2 2012. Below is an overview of the key metrics for the company's business, which showed an overall improvement from the previous year's quarter.The company has been increasing its revenues over the last few years. The same can be said about its bottom line, which has increased by over 30% since FY 2009. The company's popular ""wireless for all"" service continues to be the growth driver and is largely responsible for the recent rise in its average revenues per user. The recent launch of its talk and text plan is going strong and, according to the company, it has done well in the recent quarter. The company concentrated more on marketing its service plans in the second quarter, which have historically yielded higher margins. PCS announced that it is set to finish its 4G LTE rollout in the third quarter. PCS had almost 8% of its total customers on 4G services by Q2 2012, which is likely to go even higher as cheaper handsets are made available in the current quarter.In a previous article on PCS, we discussed the company's business model and the key growth drivers. Despite the significant deterioration in the company's first-quarter results, we suggested a bright outlook for the company. A consistent rise in revenues, net income, average revenue per user, and a declining churn indicate that the company has strength in its operations. The stock is trading at 10 times its earnings, at a discount to both its industry and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) (at 16 times) and AT&T (NYSE:T) (at 14 times). Other multiples, like P/S (0.62 times) and P/B (1 times), are also at a discount to the company's  peers. We believe there is a contradiction between the company's poor stock performance and its fundamentals, and suggest that the stock has reasonable price appreciation potential. The most recent upgrade has come from Deutsche Bank, going from ""hold"" to ""buy.""Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
715061,29461,2012-07-11T13:20:13-04:00,,"Despite deteriorating fundamentals, which the market has already priced in, we believe the stock has upside potential because of the following reasons:MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (PCS)MetroPCS Communications, Inc. is a wireless telecom company that is offering wireless broadband, internet and voice services to its customers in the United States. It has approximately 9.5 million customers and is headquartered in Texas. PCS is well known for its ""no annual contract"" cell plan, which offers unlimited talk and text services, which are taxes and fees inclusive. Moreover, it offers various products like cell phones and smartphones, along with value plans through its various retail outlets. Its worth is $2.30 billion and has an average volume of $6.5 million.The company derives a majority of its revenues from its Service Division, while the rest comes from its sale of handsets and smartphones. In the quarter ended 2012, the company increased its service revenues by 10% from the same quarter of the previous year. A higher average revenue per user continues to be the company's key growth driver, and is largely responsible for the boost in service revenues. The chart indicates that the company's average revenue per user improved sequentially, as well as from the same quarter of the previous year. Quarterly growth of 14 cents in 1Q2012 was led by the demand for the company's ""Wireless for All"" services. The above mentioned service was launched in 2010 and has become quite popular among consumers ever since, with its focus on predictability, flexibility and affordability. It offers various inexpensive cell and smartphones, along with different cell phone plans and other features. 4G LTE smartphones continue to be the growth driver for the company and have driven the company's ARPUs. The company, through its partnership with Huawei, recently added the Huawei Activa™ 4G handset to its line of smartphones, which is being offered on a discounted price. We expect strong sales for this product going forward, as it has received some positive reviews so far.Quarterly Results:Overall, quarterly results were disappointing compared to the prior year's quarter. Despite revenues increasing by 7%, income from operations and net income dropped by 32% and 63% respectively. This is a significant decline considering the first quarter is usually the most profitable for the company. The company saw less traffic in its outlets for its products, which was one of the major reasons for the decline in its profits for the quarter. It was able to add only 131,654 customers, compared to 1Q2011's 725,945, which is a slowdown of almost 80. Increased infrastructure costs and handset upgrade expenses also had a negative impact on the company's earnings, which showed a deterioration of almost 60% in the quarter. EPS dropped to $0.06 from the previous $0.15, with the company not able to beat the consensus sell side estimates of $0.13.The chart given above gives the historical breakup of net customer additions for the company, clearly showing the slowdown in summer months in terms of additions, as well as the strength of the first quarter. PCS's deteriorating fundamentals suggest that the company may face losses going forward, however we also believe that much of this deterioration has already been priced in.However, the company's yearly results tell a different story, or shall we say a turnaround story. Its revenues have grown by a 2-year CAGR of almost 20%, with gross margins of 40%, which have remained at these levels over the last few years. Operating income has also been on an upward trend and has shown a compounded growth of almost 20% as well, over a period of two years. The same can be said about the company's bottom line, which grew by over 50% in FY2011. On the face of it, big telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon seem to be doing well, both in their wireline and wireless segments, but even Verizon has seen its profits fall in recent years with its bottom line deteriorating by almost 6% in the last fiscal year. PCS's bottom line not only improved in the year ended 2011, it has also been on a consistent upward trend, as opposed to Verizon's declining trend. Moreover, its operating cash flows have shown reasonable improvement over the years, growing at a compounded rate of almost 10% over the last two years. The company has trailing operating cash flows of over $1 billion, and a cash balance of approximately $2 billion, which indicates that it has the ability to generate cash flows year over year.Potential Takeover TargetRecently, there have been talks on the possible takeover of PCS and LEAP by telecom giants like AT&T and Verizon. This is seen as an attempt by bandwidth-hungry companies to gain more waves and expand their spectrum. Since smaller companies like PCS and LEAP concentrate on the prepaid market, it makes them ideal candidates for a takeover by companies like AT&T and Verizon. In such a scenario, PCS and LEAP are likely to see their currently depressed valuations rise. The stock's performance has been dismal in the recent past, clearly indicated by the graph below, losing almost 25% of its value since the start of the year.Possible TurnaroundValuationIt is clear from the table above that the company's multiples are trading at a significant discount to the company's peers, and this discount is also visible relative to the industry multiples. However, its earnings growth expectations are higher than telecom giants. We believe that at such cheap valuations, the stock could be an attractive option with a strong possibility of a turnaround expected from its low cost prepaid services.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
578411,24714,2012-05-10T13:33:06-04:00,,"On May 9th, 2012, it was leaked that Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) is in talks for merging MetroPCS (PCS) with T-Mobile, causing MetroPCS shares to spike over 14 percent in midday trading. The merge between the fourth largest U.S. wireless carrier and the seventh largest would still not surpass Sprint (NYSE:S) in terms of subscribers, but it would allow for T-Mobile to improve its footprint on the market. In this article, I analyze this potential merger and provide some insight about how to invest.The big opportunity that I see with this merger is that MetroPCS has an LTE network and T-Mobile will not have an LTE network until 2013. Acquiring MetroPCS and closing the deal quickly could allow T-Mobile to potentially go live with their LTE technology early and it would strengthen MetroPCS's existing network, which has mediocre reviews.The big risk that I see with T-Mobile and MetroPCS merging is that they use different technology. T-Mobile uses GSM technology, like AT&T Mobility (NYSE:T) while MetroPCS uses CDMA technology, like Verizon Wireless (NYSE:VZ) and Sprint. The changeover may turn away MetroPCS subscribers and the effects would be felt immediately as MetroPCS subscribers do not have contracts.What these talks tell me is that Deutsche Telekom is looking for an acquisition to boost its T-Mobile USA pay-as-you-go business. Leap Wireless (NYSE:LEAP) shares also took double digit gains after the news was reported as investors believe they will benefit from MetroPCS being bought or that LEAP is also a potential target. Leap Wireless, owner of the Cricket network, has similar wireless technology to Verizon, MetroPCS, and Sprint.In the end, these talks are just a seemingly desperate attempt for T-Mobile USA to add more subscribers and utilize economies of scale. There are now 9 mobile networks in the United States with more than 5 million subscribers and number 10 has fewer than 1 million subscribers. Clearwire's majority ownership by Sprint takes them out of the pictures, so that just leaves TracFone, MetroPCS, Cricket, and U.S. Cellular for T-Mobile to potentially acquire. None of these potential acquisitions should spark anti-trust concerns.I believe that MetroPCS and Leap Wireless each have about a 50 percent chance of being acquired or merging in the next 18 months. If they do get bought out, expect a nice premium and returns of over 30 percent for investors. I would suggest going long on both MetroPCS and Leap Wireless right now. As for T-Mobile, I believe they will continue to struggle and investors should stay away. Their owner, Deutsche Telekom, has other businesses affected by other market events, so I wouldn't recommend shorting the stock either. Mobile networks have huge fixed costs and adding subscribers has incredibly positive effects on these companies' earnings. Expect them to do everything they can legally do to team up.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
505681,24802,2012-04-18T03:33:14-04:00,,"Our investment philosophy for the most part is based on investing in companies that leverage clear, secular trends that have little correlation to business cycles. These include growth in smartphones and tablets, cloud computing, and biotechnology. Our preference for leading companies in these growth industries means that we usually have little exposure to what may be considered a classic ""value stock,"" meaning one with a low P/E ratio and a solid dividend yield.That is not to say that we do not see the merits of ""value"" investing. Like any strategy, it has its own set of benefits and detriments, and for us, it is simply not the strategy that we choose to follow. However, there are times when we come across a stock whose value is simply too compelling, and too deep to ignore. And we believe that we have found such a stock in MetroPCS (PCS).MetroPCS is the nation's 5th largest wireless carrier, and currently serves 9.3 million subscribers. Over the past year, the stock has fallen sharply, losing nearly half its value, placing its performance in line with fellow regional cellular company Leap Wireless (LEAP).Competition in the wireless sector is fierce, and has taken its toll on all companies in the sector, including AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ), and Sprint (S). Some companies are simply not able to generate profits at the present, such as Leap and Sprint (although Sprint's situation is much more complex). Yet, MetroPCS is still profitable, and the fall it has experienced over the past year has caused the stock to arrive at valuations we think are too compelling to ignore. We profile MetroPCS's valuations below, as well as those of its peers in the wireless industry.Valuation: Cheap by Almost Any MeasureMetroPCS trades at a price/cash flow ratio of 3.57 (according to Schwab figures), earning it the distinction of being the 11th cheapest company in the S&P 500 (SPY) on that basis (different financial websites arrive at different price/cash flow figures; our own calculations yield a price/cash flow ratio of 2.84). MetroPCS reported operating cash flows of $1.061808 billion in 2011, a 6.77% increase from its 2010 oenerating cash flows of $994.5 million. Looking at MetroPCS's stock price would lead one to assume that it is suffering financially, yet its actual results disprove that notion.MetroPCS also trades at a discount to the rest of the wireless sector on a price/book basis. Based on the company's fourth quarter and full year 2011 results, the company has a book value of $8.05 per share, giving it a price/book ratio of 1.03 as of this writing. For comparison, AT&T has a book value per share of $17.85, giving it a price/book ratio of 1.73. Verizon has a book value of $30.26, giving it a price/book ratio of 1.24. MetroPCS trades at a P/E ratio of 10.1, and a forward P/E of just 9.4.While this is a very low level for a company projected to grow earnings, we do not think that this metric should be used to evaluate MetroPCS' superiority as an investment over AT&T and Verizon, for their earnings were depressed in 2011 due to a variety of one-time charges and expenses (and Leap and Sprint do not have P/E ratios as they are unprofitable).Value or Value Trap?Critics may argue that MetroPCS is not a value stock, but a value trap, for it cannot compete effectively in the wireless industry. And there have been times when that may have been the case. In August, shares fell 37% as the company missed analyst expectations for the quarter. MetroPCS reported earnings of 23 cents per share, below the consensus estimate of 29 cents, and announced 200,000 subscriber additions, below the consensus estimates of 240,000.The miss was further exacerbated by the company offering only a ""soft economy"" as reasons for the slow subscriber growth. Still, a 37% drop was too much in our opinion. MetroPCS, despite operating in a fiercely competitive environment, posted improved results in 2011 over 2012 across almost all operating and financial metrics.MetroPCS Financial & Operational Results, 2010-2011MetroPCS may have added less users in 2011 than in 2010, but its subscribers generated more revenue as they signed up for higher priced plans. Churn rose by 5.5%, but the prepaid business is inherently more volatile than the postpaid business. Leap Wireless, MetroPCS' most direct competitor, reported churn of 3.8% as well for 2011 (Leap Wireless, however, managed to improve this metric from 4.7% in 2010, further demonstrating the variance that can be seen in the prepaid business).MetroPCS is solidly profitable, and posted record results in both the fourth quarter (GAAP EPS of 25 cents and adjusted EBITDA of $362 million) and 2011 as a whole. 2012, based on current estimates is set to be yet another record year. Current analyst estimates, as reported by Reuters, call for a profit of 17 cents per share in the first quarter, and full year 2012 earnings of 88 cents per share. While this represents a decline in growth from 2011 levels, profits will still rise 7.32% from 2011 levels, and revenue is projected to come in at $5.3 billion for 2012, representing growth of 9.34%.Even though growth will decelerate in 2012, the company's valuation is low enough to mitigate that impact. At under 10 times 2012 earnings, MetroPCS is being valued as if it will be destroyed by AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile. We, however, do not see it that way and think that it is better to invest in the stock now before others realize this fact.Analyst OpinionsAnalysts are mixed in their opinions of MetroPCS, but overall sentiment is bullish. It is interesting to note that several analysts have seeming contradictions in the ratings and targets. Several have neutral ratings and offer very lukewarm opinions on the company, but have price targets implying substantial upside. Credit Suisse, for example, rates MetroPCS neutral, yet has a $13 price target on the stock, implying upside of 57%. We offer several analyst opinions below. For the record, the Reuters average price target on shares of MetroPCS currently stands at $12.31, implying upside of 48.67% as of this writing.Sprint: Deal or No Deal?We turn now to rumors of a takeover by Sprint. The offer was reportedly nixed at the last minute by Sprint's board. We think that this move was for the best, at least from Sprint's perspective. Sprint's stock price is too low to effectively fund a takeover without massive dilution. Furthermore, the company has far too much to deal with as it is without adding another element into the mix (however, we applaud Sprint for its solid execution on Network Vision, the iPhone launch, and the general turnaround that the company has seen).The termination of the deal with Sprint calls to question whether or not another suitor for MetroPCS will emerge. Verizon, as the other national CDMA carrier, seems like a logical choice, but we do not think that such a deal will pass an anti-trust review. Nor will a deal with AT&T, which would add a host of other technological issues to resolve.A merger with another, ""non-national"" carrier, namely Leap Wireless, is certainly possible, but we have not seen any solid rumors or evidence to suggest that such a deal is in the works. MetroPCS, however, has hinted that it is open to a spectrum deal with Clearwire (CLWR), a move that Leap Wireless has already made. Clearwire and Leap signed a 5-year wholesale LTE deal in March.ConclusionsWe think that there is too much value in shares of MetroPCS for investors to ignore the company. The stock has fallen sharply over the past year, even as the company reported record profits and revenues, and is forecast to do so again in 2012. We think that this contradiction between the company's performance and its stock price will eventually end. MetroPCS is trading as if the company will be driven into bankruptcy because of competition in the prepaid wireless market.But its results disprove that thesis. The company is solidly profitable, has increased ARPU, and has solid operating cash flows. In addition, MetroPCS is valued at deep discounts to both its peers and the broader market (on a price/cash flow basis, the stock is one of the cheapest in the S&P 500). While we may not gravitate towards value stocks, we believe the value in shares of MetroPCS is too compelling to ignore. And we think that investors who add to or initiate positions in MetroPCS will be rewarded for their belief in the company.Disclosure: I am long CLWR, T, VZ.Additional disclosure: We are long shares of T and VZ via the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF. In addition, we may initiate a long position in PCS in the next several days."
673821,24284,2012-06-21T04:09:38-04:00,,"Fundamentally, MetroPCS (PCS) is not the company its stock price would suggest. This may be due to a number of factors, but one of which seems to be ignorance.Markets are nearly efficient, but in some instances a brand image can overly influence investors' opinion of a stock. Because MetroPCS has been cast by many cell phone users as an inferior network, many investors automatically assume the stock itself is also of inferior quality. At this time, neither of those assumptions is correct.Several years back, MetroPCS did have a fairly low quality network with snail speed Internet. Calls would occasionally drop. Callers would frequently not hear each other properly, especially deep inside of large buildings. But even then, the network got the job done and for the correct price, all the while making the company profit. Since then, call quality on the network has risen dramatically and Internet speed is sufficient for even every day users. Dropped calls are rather rare, and voice quality on the newest 4G LTE phones is nearly indistinguishable from carriers like Verizon (VZ), AT&T (T), or Sprint (S).In the future, a network upgrade to VOLTE/VOIP will allow MetroPCS to offer even higher quality voice services to its users, possibly called HD Voice, and at the same time allow a more efficient use of network resources and spectrum.All of this excellent financial and technological management has resulted in MetroPCS sitting on nearly $2 billion in cash. Because that cash is likely invested and earning less than 1% per year, and shares are trading at a large discount, there is an argument that it could be time to finally buy back shares. Common stock has a built in cost, and in this case that cost is in the neighborhood of 6-7% per year. Meaning, the cost of equity is higher than the return on cash.With such a massive war chest and stable business, I believe MetroPCS ought to show the market which company actually can afford to buy MetroPCS out. And that company is none other than MetroPCS itself.A share buyback would put some of the cash to work and improve company valuation. Profit, equity, and liabilities per share would all rise.By offering to buy shares at $6.50 per share, using only $400 million of the nearly $2 billion in cash, MetroPCS could buy back 61 million shares, literally 17% of all shares outstanding, and still have more than enough money left to fight off the increasing competition and recent slowdown in profit.The future is bright for MetroPCS because other options for that cash exist too. A dividend, a large network expansion, or a buyout of a smaller company could all be announced. But in the end, a medium sized share buyback seems to reward investors sufficiently while continuing the company's high rate of growth.For comparative purposes, the chart below shows that Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T have roughly $6 billion, $7 billion, and $2.5 billion in cash, respectively. This means that MetroPCS has nearly as much cash as AT&T, a company which is valued 95 times higher than MetroPCS.Disclosure: I am long PCS.Additional disclosure: I have written puts on the shares."

It offers value for consumers and the ability to have a mobile phone without a contract as most competitors require. While this company does not offer the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, it does offer a variety of popular smartphones. The affordability and lack of commitment has led many consumers to switch to MetroPCS. Shares of this company have dropped along with the rest of the market and that is giving investors a better entry point.

Recently the stock has begun to rebound and there is some speculation that MetroPCS will rebound because of its unique position in the market. In this article I should how the company has a chance for success in the near future and why it is currently a good buy.As of December 2011, MetroPCS had 9.3 million subscribers, making it the 7th-largest mobile carrier in the United States. It utilizes CDMA and LTE technology (which Verizon Wireless uses) and boast a 4G network although its 4G speeds are sometimes compared with larger networks' 3G speeds. What makes MetroPCS' angle interesting is that it offers an Android phone with no contract and unlimited data in some of its plans, which puts it in a league of its own. However, there are still some drawbacks.Smart phones on the MetroPCS network do not have the same capabilities as smart phones on the larger networks, but service is a lot cheaper and with no contract. On its 4G network, the $50 per month plan only offers 1 GB of multimedia streaming while the $60 plan offers unlimited streaming. A similar plan with 2 GB of data at Verizon costs around $120 per month. The two services are definitely not the same quality, but there are a lot of more basic cell phone users who could go for those savings.The bet that MetroPCS is making is very smart considering its position. It is looking to attract less active mobile phone users, who want most of the perks of what major carriers can do, but without a contract, overage fees, or high pricing. This may not attract the entire market, but the company could definitely make a move to become the 5th-largest provider within the next two to three years.Now is a good time to buy MetroPCS shares as the stock is very undervalued. Shares have a one-year forward P/E ratio of 10.38 and a 2-year forward P/E ratio well under 9, with earnings growth expected to be 26.9 percent per year for the next five years. There are obviously a lot of scenarios that can play out during this time, but right now, it seems like a very cheap stock.There is still a lot of opportunity for investing in telecom stocks, both here and abroad. Right now, I believe that among U.S. mobile operators, MetroPCS stock has the most growth potential by far over the next two to three years. For aggressive investors, it is a definite buy. With a good business model, low valuation, and a 1-year growth target 33.3 percent higher that its closing price on March 8, MetroPCS could have giant returns.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
301881,24284,2011-10-25T10:54:38-04:00,,"Just when MetroPCS (PCS) finally had some true competition with its rates and service, the unthinkable happened.  It turned out the deal was a bait and switch.  While MetroPCS has continued to offer a true value, others have seized the opportunity to take advantage of the low end market by just telling lies to steal customers.  First it was T-Mobile pretending to offer unlimited data; now Virgin Mobile, a subsidiary of Sprint (NYSE:S), recently announced it would cap its data plan with only 2.5GB of 3G speed.  This is a decent deal still, but the dishonesty in management's marketing effort to get customers over to the company is alarming, and shows desperation.  This comes on the heels of a price increase of $10 per month on the lowest-price plan as well.  As of now, MetroPCS is selling for dirt cheap, as some investors left town briefly due to the current slowdown in subscriber growth.  This will fade as customers realize the value MetroPCS is offering compared to the so-called competition. Reviews abound, and most say that the 3G offered by Virgin Mobile is very spotty and offers inconsistent speeds -- sometimes fast, sometimes slow.  Reviews of MetroPCS 4G show much more consistent connection and speed.  Speeds are not fast for 4G, but are much faster and more stable than all 3G services offered.Eventually customers will realize that slow 4G truly is fast and stable enough, and that unlimited 4G LTE with MetroPCS for $60 per month and a $250 phone saves a fortune over an unlimited plan from a major carrier offering 4G -- even if it gave the phone away, which it usually doesn't. The only thing left is for MetroPCS to expand its 4G network slightly further out, and to release one or two more 4G phones.  Once the 4G phones are offered for sub-$175, growth is going to boom.I am one MetroPCS subscriber who almost left for Virgin Mobile and am glad I didn't.  I'll pass on 3G altogether and just get a 4G phone in the coming months as an acceptable deal emerges.  The bottom line is, why would anybody buy a 3G phone and pay $55 per month at Virgin Mobile and not even get truly unlimited data, when they could pay $60 per month at MetroPCS for truly unlimited 4G?  Sure, the phone costs $100 more at MetroPCS, but it is a substantially better phone with faster speeds.Disclosure: I am long PCS."

Investors are pleased with comforting net subscriber additions for the final quarter. Just half a year ago, shares lost 37% in one single day as the company warned for slower revenue and customer addition growth. But it was not just MetroPCS who had a good day on Thursday. On the back of the report, its competitors Sprint Nextel (NYSE:S) and Level3 (NASDAQ:LVLT) also rose, 13% and 12% respectively.Fourth quarter resultsThe wireless pre-paid telecommunication provider, which has a focus on metropolitan areas, has expanded its customer base by roughly 200k for the quarter (and 1.2 million for the year) to 9.3 million. Those customers spend roughly 2% more per month to over $40 per user. Consequently net revenues for the final quarter of 2011 rose 16% to $1.24 billion. Net income rose an astonishing 570% to $91 million or $0.25 per share, which exceeded the $0.16 expected by analysts. Profit margins exceeded analyst expectations as acquisition cost per new user came in at $166, up 3% year-on-year. Acquisition costs for the whole of 2011 come in at $173, indicating a slowdown in marketing efforts for the final quarter for 2011. Despite lower marketing efforts, the churn rate remained stable at 3.7%Uncertain competitive landscapeThe wireless domain is dominated by AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Wireless (NYSE:VZ), who have 99 and 90 million wireless customers, respectively.Over the last year there have been quite some developments in the industry. First,there is the failed attempt of AT&T to acquire T-Mobile's US division. AT&T was prepared to pay $39 billion in an attempt to increase coverage and add 34 million subscribers to its network. So far the deal has failed to get regulatory approval. Second there was the announcement of Verizon Wireless in December to buy airwaves from Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) for $3.6 billion in an attempt to increase national coverage to 80%. Both deals came under a lot of scrutiny as smaller wireless competitors and consumer watchdog agencies heavily protested against a possible duopoly of the industry. AT&T and Verizon Wireless are giants compared to MetroPCS as they have much wider coverage and each of them has a customer base roughly ten times that of MetroPCS, which covers roughly a third of the country.ValuationMetroPCS has been growing steadily during the last 5 years. Revenues in the period 2007-2011 rose 118% to $4.8 billion. Net income rose 93% to $193 million. Earnings per share rose 74% to $0.54 The company is valued at 22 times 2011 earnings despite a decent growth record and a steady market share in some highly populated areas. Shares are valued at 0.8 times revenues, which compares to a multiple of 1.0 times for Verizon Wireless and 1.4 times for AT&T.Shares seem to be fairly cheap in an industry which will see further consolidation in years to come and MetroPCS could definitely be part of that. AT&T's failed bid for T-Mobile valued the carrier at 1.9 times annual revenue or roughly $1100 per customer. Applying similar ratios to MetroPCS would indicate a takeout value of $9-$11 billion ($22-$27 per share), reason enough to pick up some shares for the long haul.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
313799,24284,2011-12-14T10:10:17-05:00,,"[Author's Note (March 2012) - Since article publication, the name of the phone has changed to the Samsung Galaxy Attain.]The Phone:Soon to be available at MetroPCS (PCS), the Samsung Conquer 4G comes with a 3.5 inch HVGA touchscreen, a 1Ghz Scorpion processor, a 3.2 megapixel camera and 1.3 megapixel web cam, and Android 2.3 Gingerbread. A picture is shown below.How it Affects the Business:Analysts are notoriously late to the party, usually because they have to cover so many companies. Analysts of late have been bearish on MetroPCS for the short term but bullish for the long term. They see the investments made into the 4G LTE network as perfect, but they recognize it is a longer term investment which doesn't help the bottom line much in the present.All that is about to change. The line has now been crossed. With the release of the Samsung Conquer, the 4G LTE phone lineup at MetroPCS offers enough quality and enough selection for a price that is low enough to pull in both the customers who were getting ready to upgrade and the customers from other carriers who are fed up with excessive rates and contracts, yet still want 4G smartphones. And of course MetroPCS is leading the country in low end value phones as well.MetroPCS now offers four 4G LTE phones. Consumers in urban areas are the most likely to adopt to the 4G phones because they already have complete 4G coverage. Suburban and rural areas don't all have 4G coverage yet, but the areas covered are growing every day, and all of the 4G phones offer WIFI capability.Under the radar, MetroPCS has reinvested 100% of its cash flows into developing a 4G network that offers superior quality for a superior price. Meanwhile, the big dogs of the industry, Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and AT&T (NYSE:T) have been wasting valuable dollars by paying out dividends. Those dividends paid could have been used to grow the business, but weren't. Additionally, Sprint (NYSE:S) has been losing money.When investors seek equity to invest in, they should be seeking companies which have high growth in profits and a low price for the assets, and preferably a low risk asset. Currently, MetroPCS is growing faster than any of the bigger companies and has a price book lower than any of them. Value investors already see this, but due to the way in which financial markets price assets these days, during rough times investors will take lower growth if they have the security of a dividend. This can be a poor way to invest for the long term because those invested dollars could have been put to better use.In other words, dividends provide a false sense of security which makes some stocks appear to be low risk when they are in fact high risk securities. Having a dividend will allow statistical measures of stock behavior to price in less risk than companies without. But in the case of MetroPCS, this is an anomaly that shouldn't exist. Meaning, MetroPCS should be priced as a lower risk asset than either AT&T or Verizon or Sprint due to the fact that the cash flows that MetroPCS earns are negatively correlated with market risk, while the cash flows of the other companies are mostly positively correlated with market risk.Sometimes the market gets it right. Look at Dollartree (NASDAQ:DLTR) for example. The stock is up tremendously because the company is growing and is negatively correlated with market risk relative to the competition.If the economy slows down, MetroPCS will continue to see its revenues grow, while the other companies will likely see profits falling. This is because for all intents and purposes, MetroPCS offers dramatically cheaper phones and service which people would be required to switch to if the economy plunged. To some extent, MetroPCS offers better downside protection against market risk than US T-bonds, although the market is currently not pricing as I suggest.Even the 4G LTE service is priced lower than any of the competition, meaning in a downturn, MetroPCS should still see better growth in its 4G phones than the competition, not just the 2G service.Conclusion:The release of the Samsung Conquer puts everything into place for MetroPCS. It has a strong lineup of products and service at both low end and high end which are all in one way or another negatively correlated with market risk relative to the competition. An economist couldn't design a lower risk, higher growth product lineup if he tried, and investors cannot find a more undervalued telecom equity in the United States. It is very possible in the next few years, after the 4G network is entirely built, that MetroPCS will announce a stock buyback or a dividend to reap the rewards of its smart strategy.Of late, the stock has been finding a base versus the market:Disclosure: I am long PCS."

284587,24463,2011-08-04T10:55:05-04:00,,"By John Critchley & Christopher YipMetroPCS (PCS) reported earnings before the market open on Tuesday this week and although posting higher earnings quarter over quarter, they missed estimates and announced a dismal outlook for the remainder of the year. Second quarter EPS came in at $0.24 missing expectations of $0.29 per share or about $17.9 million shy of estimates. PCS shares dropped as much as 35.5% after the market opened, falling from a previous close of $16.2 to $10.44 before catching ground and stabilizing. PCS is one of the more popular cellular service providers specializing in month-to-month plans with no annual contracts and no early termination fees. The downside to this convenience and freedom is the quality of service and the limited coverage area. Most existing customers complain about the difficulty in finding a signal even in densely populated areas such as New York City, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Boston. Furthering their case, customers frequently experience dropped calls and poor connections.The low priced plans are attractive to young individuals, specifically high school and college students, and recent graduates who are either cost conscience or working with tight budgets. With such a young crowd making up for more than 50% of the PCS customer base, this makes forecasts and trends very difficult to predict accurately. Which helps explain why the PCS churn rate may have missed the mark this past quarter. In the face of tougher economic conditions, young individuals using PCS may opt to skip a month or two of cellular service by temporarily suspending their line of service. And with no termination fee and only $15 to reconnect a suspended line, this option can potentially save a typical user $85 over the course of two months and makes for a very sneaky yet chic way to rack up savings. As PCS explicitly pointed out in its forward statement, economic uncertainty and poor job growth within the U.S has hindered the growth rate of customers and will ultimately affect the original FY2011 estimates.Across the lower end cellular service providers, shares of Sprint (NYSE:S) and Leap Wireless (NYSE:LEAP) both took a hammering as well. LEAP-ing off a cliff in sympathy with PCS, LEAP shares lost 19% of its market value following PCS’ earnings in early trading Tuesday. Sprint had announced earnings last week and gapped down from $5.16 to $4.23 last Thursday after revealing a loss of customers and a worse than expected EPS. But this is no indication that telecom giants, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), are out of the woods. Shares of both companies have pulled back in the past few weeks, retreating about 6%. AT&T’s next earnings release is scheduled for October 17th, with Verizon following closely behind on October 21st. Unlike little siblings PCS, LEAP, and S, big brothers AT&T and VZ both issue dividends over 5% and are often treated as safe stocks in the advent of a sour market.  Options PlaysFrom an option trading standpoint, the real question is what are the chances that the stock stays around $10? With PCS plummeting following earnings, the 30 day implied volatility of the options is near its’ 52 week highs.  The 30 day implied volatility is trading around 56.9%, significantly higher than the 52 week implied volatility low of 30.54% hit in May of this year. The argument that implied volatility is too high is not hard to make – they just released earnings, the news is out.  However, the opposite argument that implied volatility is too low or just about right is just as convincingly made – where the stock goes from here, no one knows; this just isn't a stable underlying. Quite understandable considering the massive collapse in the underlying and the uncertainty of the company going forward.  Is the business model broken and the stock has further legroom to fall? Or does the depreciation in share price make the underlying a possible takeover candidate and ripe pickings for bargain hunters?    If you believe in either scenario and are in the camp that PCS will continue to be quite volatile, the buying of options at this level is a reasonable option play to take advantage of the unclear future of PCS.Let’s take advantage of these uncertainties to initiate a brand new long implied volatility position in PCS.Trade idea -An Options Play  To find the most reasonable implied volatility option plays, let’s go out at to the Sep ’11 options, which present some interesting medium term value.   The play: a)      Buy September 10 straddle for $1.50.  Paying about 50.10% in Implied Volatility. Net debit: $1.50Breakeven point:  $8.50 or $11.50 in the next 7 weeks. Why September? Normally, one would buy the front month options if they believed that the underlying would move in the near term.  This however is not always the optimal option trade.  The implied volatility of the front month August options is significantly higher than the September options. The August 10 straddle is currently trading at $1.20 or 58.08% implied volatility. The September straddle is trading at an implied volatility that is nearly 8% cheaper then August.  Quite an attractive discount.  Let’s take advantage of this calendar differential and buy the September straddle instead of August.

296024,22561,2011-09-26T16:37:02-04:00,,"MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) is a $3.37 billion wireless telecommunications carrier which offers wireless broadband mobile services in the United States. After the last earnings release PCS fell off a cliff. You can read the conference call here.  I shorted put options with a strike price of $9 expiring in August and wrote an article about why I believed the $9 puts were over priced.  After that, PCS climbed in price to around $11.50 a share before moving back into the $9 price area of support. I reviewed the available information including the financial statements, and the status is once again ripe for me to short more puts. We can see by this chart gross revenue is on a very steady and consistent climb higher.Click to enlarge   PCS currently is faced with an upcoming internet rule scheduled to take effect November 20, 2011. The rule from the FCC is concerned with net neutrality and the ability of Internet providers to curb the use of large bandwidth hogs like movie streaming to use an ""unreasonable"" amount of capacity. PCS customers have increased the amount of Internet use from increased sales of smart phones. The rule is going to find its way into the courts about .00001 seconds after publication in the federal register. PCS can be expected to sue in court along with AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). While the rule may have an impact, I believe the relative impact for PCS will be less than others that compete in the same space.  There are statements in the conference call clearly signaling the FCC rule matters, but at the same time it is not a deal breaker:Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Roger Linquist -The attraction is from the single digit forward PE ratio of 8.75, a book value of over $7.60 per share, along with a proven, steady rising revenue stream. This is a growth stock without the growth price tag.  The highest volume, most attractive put options currently are the November $8 strike price with a bid of $0.50 each, while the stock is trading at about $9.10. Shorting put options offers me a way to gain exposure to PCS with lower risk than buying the stock outright. I believe the options are currently under priced and I intend on shorting. All else being equal, I find the openings to be the best time to short options.  I use a proprietary blend of technical analysis, financial crowd behavior and fundamentals in my short-term trades, and while not totally the same in longer swing trades to investments, the concepts used are similar. Based on my criteria, I have come to the following conclusion: This one is worth the time to investigate further for an ideal entry price to either write put options or buy the stock. Of course that in itself does not mean you should, but you may want to use this article as a starting point for your own research with your financial planner. I use Seeking Alpha, Edgar Online, Google Finance, MSN Money, cnbc.com, Zacks and Yahoo Finance for most of my data.

284184,24284,2011-08-03T12:08:39-04:00,,"Tuesday MetroPCS (PCS) dropped over 36% on the news that its earnings missed estimates by four cents. In my prior articles I have been noting that MetroPCS was starting to become overvalued with the encroaching competition starting to surround it, which has been proven to have been an accurate assessment. AT&T/T-mobile (NYSE:T) and Sprint (NYSE:S) are pressuring the high end of the low end market, while Virgin Mobile and Boostmobile are competing for the bargain shoppers. But the drop in stock price today changes everything.Macro OutlookMy prior articles show that I am increasingly bearish about the U.S. economy. I feel that a recession is likely already here. First quarter GDP was revised down to only 0.4% growth, which means Q2 has an excellent chance to be revised down to negative growth, signaling a true double dip recession. As a result of the congressional budget cuts that are undoubtedly going to roll downstream in the coming year, government job layoffs will continue, with little to no end in sight for the near future. This means people who have high discretionary incomes will increasingly become forced to buy cheaper products as they are laid off from their government jobs.Portfolio Value and CorrelationBecause MetroPCS is widely known to be the low cost leader in the telecommunications industry, a recession will not hurt MetroPCS sales very much at all. In fact, there is even the potential that Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T users may be forced to cancel their subscriptions in favor of a cheaper plan which still offers the basic necessities. The fact that the competition is encroaching MetroPCS' market only reemphasizes the fact that MetroPCS targeted the market correctly from the start, while the others missed.Because the products and revenues are fairly immune to an economic slowdown, especially relative to the competition, owning MetroPCS equity offers special value that most other stocks don't. To some extent, MetroPCS profits are negatively correlated with market risk. Meaning, as the rest of your stocks fall in value because their profits are plunging in the recession, MetroPCS profits will be very steady. This aspect of risk makes MetroPCS very, very valuable.Competitive MarketAs I have said in my recent articles, Boostmobile and Virgin Mobile in particular are now offering solid competition, but truthfully they are offering service roughly only equally as valuable as MetroPCS, with a few temporary exceptions. There is no reason for metro users to cancel their service and to run to the competition, especially when metro is getting further and further along building its 4G LTE network coverage.MetroPCS really is only one phone away from being untouchable in the lower and lower mid markets. Once MetroPCS releases a 4G LTE phone which has android and costs less than $200, or drops the price on its current two models, the competition won't be able to take the heat because they are relying on older technology. The 4G network is very cost efficient but needs a bit more time to be completed.The 3G quality that is offered by Boostmobile and Virgin mobile is not as good as MetroPCS 4G LTE coverage. The only hiccup is just waiting for MetroPCS to get more coverage area with 4G. MetroPCS has been investing and planning for the future extremely well, and will realize results of nothing but increased brand loyalty, quality of service, and continued cheap pricing. A slowdown in growth is no reason for a stock to fall 36% in one day. The telecom industry's big names can be seen in the chart below in comparison to MetroPCS over the past five days.(Click to enlarge)We can see that Sprint took a beating as well last week on news that its loss widened significantly, even as prepaid subscriptions from its Boostmobile and Virgin Mobile subsidiaries saw significant growth. The problem that Sprint has is that it has too much infrastructure built for the high end market; consequently losses have resulted. This profit emergency forced Sprint to fix its mistake by getting a solid low end market as part of its brand, which it has finally done. The problem is, Sprint still has its high end brand and its massive losses to deal with.Valuation SummaryIf you agree that the recession is picking up steam and that most consumers ought to probably be looking to spend less on their phones rather than more, and you want to own a company which has profits every quarter rather than losses due to managerial errors and backtracking, you might want to get in on probably the most unjustified selloff of the year.MetroPCS is selling for a tremendous discount, and there are numerous potential investments. One could buy the shares themselves or use options. Whatever the investor's choice, I think MetroPCS provides the missing piece to most well designed portfolios, especially if the recession accelerates. It frightens me to think that some people would prefer to buy Verizon stock or AT&T stock rather than MetroPCS, even at a massive discount and as the recession gains steam.$10.26 for a share of MetroPCS stock is a steal, and if you can get yourself some shares, I would. I feel the shares are worth $14 right now. The company can handle a recession as good as any in the United States, and because of its rollout of 4G LTE, its quality is improving as well. This is an entry point that is so good, you may not see a better one from any company in 2011. Actually, I challenge anyone to provide a common stock with as low of risk which has a better value.Something to keep in mind for those worried about fundamentals is that MetroPCS has the best 5yr expected PEG ratio in its industry. It is likely the ratio will worsen a bit as analysts will reduce expected growth based on the results reported today, but even then the ratio will still be superior to the sector's valuation by a large distance, indicating cheap pricing and excellent growth.MetroPCS also has the best current ratio in the industry, which means it is the least likely of any company to have trouble paying its liabilities over the next year.KEY POINTS:Disclosure: I am long PCS. My position was opened after the selloff."
285460,22561,2011-08-07T18:03:11-04:00,,"MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (PCS) is a $3.37 billion wireless telecommunications carrier which offers wireless broadband mobile services in the United States. Metro recently reported earnings, and the market did not take kindly to the numbers. I believe the word ""crushing"" comes to mind when I look at the chart. Interestingly, profits were good compared to the same period last year and several of the key metrics appeared better than what may be expected in this tough environment.On August 1st, Metro closed at $16.18, and by the time the market closed on August 2nd, investors found that their shares were only worth just above $10 a share at $10.19. To add insult to injury, the price was now well below the 200 day moving average, which takes it off the possible purchase list for many money managers. The following few days were not kind in the least to those who hoped for a quick bounce.Two more days of selling brought the shares to an intraday low under $9.00 a share. That's when I decided to examine the situation more closely. I read over the conference call transcript and the earnings release documents and I liked what I read. While some of the metrics had disappointed, I believed the combination of a new discount in price, along with the high premium being paid for out of the money $9.00 put options, there was opportunity. Here are the numbers I reviewed, and what brought me to the conclusion that Metro should be added to my account. I will start with the conference call:Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Roger Linquist -I have recently written about the increase in popularity of smartphones. You can read the article that includes some of the key numbers here. The ability to compete on a level playing field with the post-pay carriers undoubtedly will be important to the success of pre-pay carriers and Metro, in my opinion, is doing this well. The numbers appear to be inline with the post-pay carriers, and that is impressive considering the demographics of the customer base.I then focused my attention to the revenue growth. What I like about a company like Metro is that it receives payment upfront. While some fraud is going to happen with any company, the ability to understand the real revenue appears to be easier from an investor point of view to hedge against accounting 'adjustments'.Annually, revenue is growing at a rate of 16.92% (compared to Verizon (NYSE:VZ) at about 3%). Despite this monster growth, the forward PE ratio is less than 20 AND the company is making money. That important fact caught my attention, so I looked further.The Quick Ratio is 1.79. A number above 1 generally passes muster and we can consider the basic finances to be solid. Metro has a very reasonable price to book ratio (ttm) of 1.77. Metro also has a price to sales ratio of 1.11, which is below the average of 1.29 for the sector (higher than for the industry, but expected for the level of comparable growth).I won't say that the margins are impressive when put against the industry, but that should be expected as Metro is a price value provider.Beyond the aforementioned numbers, PCS has rising earnings year-over-year (yoy) of $193.42 for 2010 vs. $176.84 for 2009, and rising EBIT year-over-year (yoy) of $718.90 for 2010 vs. $535.29 for 2009. Rising revenue along with rising earnings is a very good sign and something we want to see with our investments. The last quarter earnings release supports my belief that the market has more than fully priced in the disappointment. I believe the downside is now far outweighed by the potential reward, and the overall market sell-off has aided to create opportunity allowing the taking of shares from investors who are now spooked to the point of willing to sell so cheaply.At 10.08 million shares traded per day (or more lately), the stock is highly liquid so it is easy to get in and out if a stop loss is triggered. The options have been somewhat liquid, but not without at least a nickel spread. I entered into PCS by shorting the August $9 put options for various accounts Thursday. PCS did trade higher Friday, so I took another look at buying the stock outright. I decided to wait until after the weekend and review the price action to see if I would like to add to the position. I like PCS at the current price, and I believe if you take a hard look, you will too.I use a proprietary blend of technical analysis, financial crowd behavior, and fundamentals in my short-term trades, and while not totally the same in longer swing trades to investments, the concepts used are similar. Based on my criteria, I have come to the following conclusion: This one is worth the time to investigate further for an ideal entry price to either write put options or buy the stock.

250198,24284,2011-02-02T06:49:17-05:00,,"The Products:If you haven't heard, MetroPCS (PCS) is going to release the Samsung Forte February 23rd for the price of $399. This seems high at first glance, but on closer inspection one finds that this is in fact the best value for any smartphone available in the US. With the introduction of a true high speed internet phone, metropcs can now be compared on a roughly apples to apples basis with the other major phone companies.Because PCS offers unlimited 4G LTE service for as little as $50 per month, subscribers save dramatic amounts of money over time compared to users of other companies. For example, if one were to pay $399 for the Forte next month, then sign a basic LTE plan for $50 per month and then keep the plan for 24 months, just as other company plans require, the total equals only $1600 for two years, or $67 per month.TMobile, a subsidiary of Deutshe Telekom AG (OTCQX:DTEGY) offers the similar Samsung Vibrant for $99. This phone is roughly the same as the Forte, but slightly more outdated. Service at Tmobile costs $99 per month. The total for two years of service comes to $2475 including the phone, or $103 per month.Similarly, Sprint (NYSE:S) offers the Samsung Epic 4G for $199 with service that costs $99 per month. The Samsung is probably slightly better than the Forte though. Total cost is $2575 or $107 per month.Verizon (NYSE:VZ) offers the Samsung Fascinate, an almost identical phone, for $199 and then unlimited service costs about $110 per month, and that doesn't even include totally, totally unlimited texting. Instead, Verizon caps it at 500 texts per month. Total cost over 24 months is $2840, or $118 per month, as long as you don't text too much.AT&T (NYSE:T) sells a slightly lower model phone than either the metropcs or the verizon called the samsung captivate for $149 and several other similar phones in the same price range. The service costs $130 per month for unlimited use, or $105 with a cap on data usage. So for just $5 more per month one can get Verizon service with unlimited data usage. Including the phone, ATT costs the most of any major service at $3270 for two years, or $136 per month.The verdict: It is best to test the coverage of any cell phone provider in your area before you buy. Clearly, if you do so, and you find no problems with MetroPCS in your area, the Forte offers the best value of any smartphone on the market. Through personal experience I have found that T-mobile and MetroPCS have nearly identical coverage, so even with spotty coverage, Metro comes out on top between Metro and Tmobile. Additionally, because the LTE network is so new, nobody is really sure yet, but coverage and talking may have been significantly improved over the new network to cover some of those spotty areas.If you have more money to spend and want to have the best possible coverage then your best buy would probably be either the Sprint or the Verizon. AT&T seems to be the most overpriced of any carrier, and it is probably due to the monopoly it had with the iphone. I wouldn't be surprised if AT&T is forced to cut its service cost soon.Of course this analysis fails to consider some of the advantages offered from family plans, but every provider offers an discount.I applaud MetroPCS in its efforts to bring more competitive prices to the mobile phone arena, and I will continue to be a customer.The Equity Performance:Below shows the two year performance of these companies. Clearly, PCS has underperformed the sector even though through the recession it specialized in lower end products. This means there are many utilized CAPM models which show PCS having alpha at this time. Now that the recession has begun to end, it has made a move into higher end products as well. images Now to compare the valuation metrics:To get a quick and dirty comparison I have formulated something called the VEG ratio in the far right column above. The VEG is essentially an average of the three valuation ratios in the table divided by the one year estimated growth rate for each company's sales.We can see that the ratio is similar to a PEG ratio except that it uses a lot more of the valuation picture to reach the result. We can also see that PCS is far and away the deepest value in the sector because it has the lowest valuation compared to its expected growth rate. Part of this is probably due to a lack of a dividend, but with the economy picking up steam wouldn't it be better to own a company which is reinvesting its retained earnings rather than buring them? As another quick comparison, if you look at Sprint, it has lost a ton of money and still is, and its growth rate is expected to be dramatically slower than that of PCS, yet Sprint stock has outperformed PCS stock.I think that based on the previous analysis it is fair to say that PCS offers a compelling value both in its product line and in its stock price. MetroPCS offers consumers the absolute cheapest choice for phones and is now starting to offer high end products which offer great value as well.Disclosure: I am long PCS."
245641,24284,2011-01-10T05:41:06-05:00,,"When one looks around at the economy, one finds a historically high level of unemployment and a myriad of other negative factors. In terms of portfolio theory, equities are generally in favor only when there is somewhat of a boom in the economy. The exceptions are the equities from companies which have low betas. Now and then, stocks with low betas don't have that beta based on any logic other than pure coincidence. Maybe a company did really well by accident while the market was down, so it could result in a low or even negative beta.That isn't the case with MetroPCS (PCS). It has a low beta, and deservingly so. When scanning the mobile phone market, one is hard pressed to find any company in the United States offering a cheaper plan than Metro. Metro charges $40 per month for unlimited talking, texting, and web browsing. So in other words, management at Metro has chosen to go after the low end market and become a low beta equity. And with the economy the way it is, who wouldn't call that a smart strategy and great management? So even stopping the analysis there, I feel it is the stongest mobile carrier equity.Furthermore, Metro hasn't just created the cheapest service and stuck users with the worst quality. In fact, Metro just released a major upgrade to its service by releasing 4G LTE technology. The speeds are set at about 3G speeds from other providers, but the system runs very efficiently how Metro has set it up, saving costs and allowing Metro to undercut the competition and continue to increase market share.Who can beat $40 per month for unlimited 3G speed and service? Nobody. Plain and simple. Metro has consistently sent a message to the market that it won't be underpriced. The only true competitor it has only has small pockets of service in the US (NYSE:LEAP). Logically, LEAP has been the only mobile operator equity that has been able to keep up with PCS (see chart). The major complaint from most potential Metro users is that metro doesn't offer any Android phones. Well, recently, metro addressed that weakness and now offers several. Even without Android though, Metro phones offer absolutely everything anybody would ever need: phone, Internet, texting, navigator, touchscreen, email, instant messenger, decent camera, mp3 player, bluetooth, and quite a bit more.But the best yet really is still to come for metro. In the coming months, it is almost a certainty that several low cost (sub $200) 4G LTE Android phones will be released. These phones will provide the best value in the entire US.Think of it from a financial advisor's standpoint. If you have a client who just lost her job, or hasn't had one in three years, yet she spends $130 per month on her iPhone, what would you suggest to her? If you are worth your fees, you'd advise her to cut her expenses. And with Metro providing absolutely everything necessary to live in today's world for only $40 per month, it is without any doubt the number one choice in the mobile phone market for a sluggish economy.Valuation of the company is decent too, but over the last two days the company has fallen approximately 10% on news that its subscriber growth was below analysts' consensus, but growth really still was excellent, so now could be a good time to add shares on the pullback. The chart below shows the Christmas shopping season and includes dividends.It is a mistake to look at a company's numbers first then its products. You need to analyze the company's products, then its numbers. Get the macro view straight, then the micro view straight, then the books, and lastly, the actual trade you want.I actually own a Metro PCS phone, and have a long position in the equity as well because I believe in the company. It makes products that people like myself actually need, want, and that are affordable. I used to use VZ until I switched over to PCS and have found the service to be essentially identical. The only downside I've seen at all is there are a few very tiny dead zones here and there, but the Metro website coverage map is very, very accurate, so it can greatly help you determine if it is worth switching over for you. Why would anybody really want to spend $100 or more per month on a phone? Even millionaires should rationally not want to waste money on useless spending. My girlfriend recently switched her service over from T-Mobile over to Metro and has been pleased. My mother is soon going to cancel her land line from Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and switch over to Metro as well.PCS has a price book of 1.88 and a price sales ratio of 1.20, which is very average for the industry, but an esimated earnings growth rate of 89% next quarter, and 215% the quarter after that, and 22% the quarter after that.  Conclusion:Valuation-wise, the stock is priced average versus the industry, yet it has a much lower beta than the industry. This will not stay the case. Companies with low risk deserve higher than average valuation.If you are tired of owning stocks from companies with poor management which have no ability to find a market, and you need a tank in your portfolio with growth potential, yet which holds its ground in a down economy, you might need PCS in your portfolio. PCS was slightly overbought before the 10% correction the last two days, but it is now well priced again.Disclosure: I am long PCS."

Some traders bought the September 10 calls for $0.20 to $0.30, ensuring them the right to buy the stock for $10 even if it surges higher before the end of the week.  The calls were then sold for $0.20 to $0.25, likely by shareholders who wanted to earn extra income from their positions in the stock. The buying and selling shows how two different kinds of investors can use options to manage portfolios: The buyers eliminate the risk of the stock running away from them, while the call sellers locked in an exit price on their shares above where they're currently trading.PCS is flat on the day at $9.86 but has rallied more than 75 percent since bottoming at $5.52 in January.

As is expected, companies like Apple Computer (NASDAQ:AAPL) that have leveraged themselves into this sector are enjoying plush valuations as a result. One of the companies that is entering this sector as a consumer value is Texas-based Metro PCS (PCS), a cell-phone service provider offering a $40 per month service plan that puts it amongst the least expensive plans in the business.

206778,20568,2010-05-25T06:52:04-04:00,,"First Quarter Flashback Leading unlimited wireless carrier MetroPCS Communications (PCS) reported first-quarter 2010 earnings per share of 6 cents matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, net income plunged 48% year-over-year to $22.7 million on account of a 30% year-over-year increase in operating expenses (attributable to high handset subsidies and costs related to the new rate plans), which offset the healthy revenue growth. Revenues soared 22% year-over-year on the back of healthy subscriber accretion and a 17.4% annualized increase in service revenue. ARPU (average revenue per user) fell year-over-year, hit by aggressive price promotions. However, churn declined significantly due to healthy customer adoption of the carrier’s new ""Wireless for All"" service plan and higher spending on handset subsidies to retain customers.  We have discussed the quarterly results at length here: MetroPCS Meets, Net SlidesAgreement of Analysts Estimates for MetroPCS have been trending upward since the first-quarter results, showing a clear directional agreement. Out of a total of 26 analysts currently covering the stock, 16 have raised their estimates for 2010 over the last 30 days (with 2 increases in the last week) while 3 analysts made negative revisions. A similar trend applies to the estimates for 2011. The upswing in estimate revisions can be attributed to the favorable trends in the US prepaid market, better-than-expected revenues, lower churn and record subscriber accretion in the first quarter boosted by the new service plan. MetroPCS revamped its prepaid wireless service plans in January 2010 to counter stiff competition in the low-cost unlimited prepaid segment. The revised service plans, which start at $40 per month, include all taxes and regulatory fees. MetroPCS is expected to benefit from customer migration from contract based plans to prepaid (driven by tariff rate reductions), representing the key impetus for upward estimate revisions. However, concerns over falling ARPU, increased competition, higher customer retention costs and margin pressure have led to few negative analyst opinions.Magnitude of Estimate Revisions A plethora of upward estimate revisions accompanied by a sheer directional agreement has led to a rise in annual forecasts for MetroPCS. Estimates for 2010 and 2011 have gone up by 6 cents and 11 cents over the past 30 days; they have increased by a cent each over the past 7 days. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2010 is 48 cents, reflecting a 10.23% year-over-year decline.Neutral on MetroPCS MetroPCS remains a leading low-cost service provider in the unlimited prepaid market. The company is increasingly focused on strengthening its position in this market by broadening its portfolio of discounted service plans. Moreover, the carrier continues to expand its footprint in the lucrative Northeastern US markets. MetroPCS is also exploring the possibility of buying its rival Leap Wireless (NYSE:LEAP). MetroPCS plans to launch its 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) service and several dual-mode smartphones across its metropolitan markets in the second-half 2010. The ultra-high bandwidth multimedia data applications supported by the 4G LTE network will boost revenue per user through increased minutes of use. However, MetroPCS is facing intense competition from Tier-1 national carriers such as AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Sprint Nextel (NYSE:S) which continue to attract customers with better product/service offerings. The carrier faces a fresh challenge from Sprint’s new “Beyond Talk” prepaid plan that starts at $25 and targets the lucrative youth segment. While expansion into Northeastern markets and network upgrade to 4G LTE may drive future growth, we feel that associated expenditures will strain the balance sheet. Although MetroPCS will benefit from the improving fundamentals of the U.S. prepaid market, higher promotional expenses for rolling out new service plans will dilute margins in the upcoming reporting periods. We currently have a Neutral recommendation on MetroPCS, which is supported by a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold)."

Ouch.Breen says he thought Metro PCS could distinguish itself in the pre-paid market with more up-to-date handsets and more prolific distribution channels. However, after a 5.8% churn rate in the quarter, 14% higher than he expected, it’s clear others are taking share from Metro, he writes.Who? Sprint’s (NYSE:S) Boost Mobile, for one, which added 993,000 subscribers in the second quarter, compared to Metro PCS’s 206,000 net additions, America Movil’s (NYSE:AMX) Tracfone unit, in conjunction with Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Leap Wireless (NYSE:LEAP).Breen’s numbers are going down for this year, to $3.44 billion in revenue, $891.8 million in adjusted Ebitda, and 32 cents per share profit. That’s compared to a prior estimate of $3.67 billin, $962 million, and $.47.

Net income tanked 48% year-over-year to $22.7 million on account of 30% year-over-year increase in operating expenses which offset the healthy revenue growth.Revenue & EBITDA Consolidated revenue soared 22% year-over-year to $970.5 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $940 million. The growth was fueled by healthy subscriber accretion and a 17.4% annualized increase in service revenue that reached $853.3 million (88% of total sales). Equipment revenue was $117.2 million, up 70.8% year-over-year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased 12.6% to $224 million.ARPU & Churn ARPU (average revenue per user) of $39.83 represents a decline from $40.40 reported in the year-ago quarter, impacted by aggressive price promotions. However, monthly average churn (a measure of customer attrition) declined to 3.7% from 5% a year ago on the back of healthy customer adoption of the new ""Wireless for All"" service plan. MetroPCS revamped its prepaid wireless service plans in January 2010 to counter stiff competition in the low-cost unlimited prepaid segment. The revised service plans, which start at $40 per month, include all taxes and regulatory fees.Subscriber Statistics Net subscriber additions were 691,602 (a quarterly record), a significant improvement from 317,255 customers added in the previous quarter, driven by the success of the ""Wireless for All"" plan. The subscriber gains also exceed the year-ago quarter net addition of 683,694 customers. Consolidated penetration of covered population in the quarter was 7.8%, compared to 7.3% a year ago. MetroPCS exited the quarter with approximately 7.3 million customers, up 21% year-over-year.Financial Condition MetroPCS exited the quarter with consolidated cash and marketable securities of approximately $1.19 billion and total debt of approximately $3.65 billion. The carrier generated positive free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditure) of approximately $85.7 million, compared to a negative free cash flow of $6 million a year-ago.Outlook MetroPCS has not released its financial guidance for 2010 given the uncertainties in the economic and competitive environment. However, the company has provided a grim margin outlook for 2010 as it expects adjusted EBITDA margin for its core markets in the mid-30% range, which underscores the impact of higher promotional expenses for rolling out its new service plans. MetroPCS remains a leading low-cost service provider in the unlimited prepaid market. The company is increasingly focused on strengthening its position in this market by broadening its portfolio of discounted service plans. Moreover, the carrier continues to expand its footprint in the lucrative Northeastern US markets. MetroPCS is also exploring the possibility of buying its rival Leap Wireless (LEAP). MetroPCS plans to launch 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) service and several dual-mode smartphones across its metropolitan markets in the second-half 2010. The ultra-high bandwidth multimedia data applications supported by the 4G LTE network will boost revenue per user through increased minutes of use. We currently have a Neutral recommendation for MetroPCS."
113029,20856,2009-01-04T05:08:58-05:00,,"Shareholders of MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (PCS) were greeted with a sharp increase in the share price in the latter half of November. The stock rallied largely as investors endorsed the company’s low cost business model.  PCS offers customers the ability to have unlimited cell phone minutes for a low price (usually $35 to $45 per month).  In addition, customers do not have to sign a long-term contract or have their credit checked.In an environment that has been difficult for consumers, this model appears to be gaining traction.  Currently the major carriers charge an average of more than $100 per month for similar unlimited calling plans.  But one big difference is the network coverage.  Sprint (NYSE:S), AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile all have networks that span the entire US (and many areas abroad).  While PCS has signed a mutual agreement with Leap Wireless International (NYSE:LEAP) to offer roaming services for each company’s customers, the coverage is still limited.PCS is working to expand that network by concentrating on large metropolitan cities where it can get the most efficient growth out of capital expenditures.  In 2008, the company was able to launch service in its first Northeast city - Philadelphia.  Management expects to roll out New York City and Boston sometime during 2009.  While the company will likely spend $700 to 900 million in capital expenditures, management expects to add 1.4 to 1.7 million new customers.  2009 should also mark a transition for the company as it begins to operate at cash-flow positive levels.Looking at the company’s balance sheet, it ended the third quarter with cash of roughly $1.02 billion.  This appears relatively healthy, but keep in mind that the company will spend the majority of this as it pursues expansion plans.  At the same time, PCS is carrying a hefty debt load of roughly $3 billion.  This financial leverage increases risk for shareholders.  If cash-flow does not come in as expected, the company could be forced to raise capital (adding to debt or diluting shareholders), or to cut back on expansion plans.  Although the balance sheet shows total shareholders equity of $2.02 billion, assets include FCC licenses which are valued at $2.4 billion.  It is difficult to determine whether these licenses would carry the same value if they were sold on the open market.Ironically, success by MetroPCS could become its greatest liability. As the business model begins to show success and gain market share, the larger wireless companies will certainly step up the competition.  Currently the higher cost national firms are able to maintain pricing power because customers are willing to pay.  But if the business begins to shift towards low priced offerings, you can expect to see Spring, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile all cut their rates.  Since a national network is superior to coverage in a certain number of cities, the big firms will still have a competitive advantage.MetroPCS is currently trading at 31 times 2008 expected earnings and more than 20 times 2009 expectations.  While bulls argue that the growth justifies the high price, I would submit that this growth is in jeopardy due not only to a difficult economy, but also due to the potential for strong competition.  So at this point, the recent run-up in price seems to give those willing to short the stock an attractive entry.  If you are currently holding the stock, I would think carefully about lightening your exposure at this point.  Despite the strong start to the market the first day of trading, risk is still significant and could negatively effect this stock.PCS Notes Disclosure: Author does not have a position in PCS."
101174,22262,2008-10-22T12:40:00-04:00,,"On October 6, MetroPCS (PCS) pre-announced strong Q3 subscriber numbers.  Here are the highlights:PositivesNegativesMy read on the positive, albeit mixed report is that my original thesis (found here) is playing out as expected, with some caveats.The company is offering a product that resonates with the current urban consumer. It is cheap, does not require a long-term commitment, does not require a credit check, and is crucial to interacting with others in a “normal” fashion.  This is most obvious in Expansion Markets, where the supermajority of growth has been achieved in the past two quarters.  I attribute this primarily to the size and under-penetration of the Expansion Markets and the aggressive marketing campaigns that are capturing the “low-hanging fruit” there.  However, Core Market growth continues to disappoint, which is a red flag, because it demonstrates the limits of PCS’s ability to penetrate a given market.  This will become an increasingly important factor if the company cannot recalibrate expenses (particularly sales & marketing) to fit with the remaining potential in mature markets.For now, the company has a large and resilient growth engine in the Expansion Markets, and a future cash machine in the Core Markets, so it is not only a safe bet with limited downside in this economic environment, but one that potentially has significant upside even in the face of an ever-declining Nasdaq.  My thesis, time horizon, and price target all remain unchanged, with a bias towards moving higher."
175077,20568,2009-11-24T11:26:52-05:00,,"We upgrade our recommendation for MetroPCS Communications (PCS) to Neutral following the company’s better-than-expected operating results in the last quarter. Reported earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate fueled by healthy revenue growth across the company’s Core and Northeast markets. MetroPCS is benefiting from its new unlimited international calling plan which is driving revenue per user.  MetroPCS remains a leading low-cost service provider in the unlimited prepaid market in the US and will continue to benefit from the ongoing wireline replacement trend. The company is increasingly focused on strengthening its position in the unlimited prepaid segment by broadening its portfolio of discounted service plans. MetroPCS has initiated several steps to counter intense competition and drive subscriber accretion. The company is rolling out new product/services, upgrading network infrastructure and entering additional markets for growth.  The company is currently enjoying meaningful traction in the Northeast region, which is evidenced by healthy subscriber growth. Gains from the Northeastern markets continue to offset declines in Core markets (including Atlanta, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Francisco). A significant part of MetroPCS’ network infrastructure deployment initiatives is centered on the lucrative Northeast region.  MetroPCS has joined the league of the top-tier US wireless carriers such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) as the company recently declared vendors for its 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless broadband service. MetroPCS has selected Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) as network infrastructure vendor and Samsung as the supplier of LTE enabled handsets.  The company plans to launch 4G LTE service and several dual-mode smartphones across its metropolitan markets in second-half 2010. The ultra high bandwidth multimedia data applications supported by the 4G LTE network will boost revenue per user through increased minutes of use.  However, despite these encouraging growth prospects, MetroPCS contends with subscriber retention problems as customer accretion continues to decelerate on a sequential basis due to intense competition in the prepaid wireless segment. The company is experiencing sustained customer attrition in its legacy Core markets.  Churn (customer switch) level remains high due to increased customer defection as the company’s larger peers in the prepaid market such as Sprint Nextel (NYSE:S) and America Movil’s (NYSE:AMX) Tracfone continue to lure subscribers with competitive service plans and better product offerings.   While expansion into the Northeastern markets is expected to drive future growth, we feel that associated capital expenditures will strain balance sheet moving forward."
62290,20856,2008-01-30T13:30:48-05:00,,"While trolling through a list of stocks that came public in 2007, I came across Metro PCS (PCS) and was impressed enough with the chart pattern to decide to dig a little deeper and see how the story has unfolded since I last analyzed the company. The stock made an impressive run immediately after pricing the IPO at $23.00. Within a few short months, the stock had hit a high above $40. Investors were excited about growth prospects as the company began to expand the number of cities it offered service in. The expectation was that the company would be able to ramp its number of subscribers quickly and consistently as each city came online effectively competing against large carriers such as Sprint (NYSE:S), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) or AT&T (NYSE:T)The business model employed by PCS is different than the typical minute based plans offered by competition. Essentially, customers at PCS pay a monthly fee for unlimited use of the phone with no regard to minutes used. The firm does employ different tiered packages but those are based on whether a user wants to be able to use the phone outside the metro area of his plan or whether the user needs additional value added services such as texting or data. Management has pointed out that they do not attempt to fill the needs of every demographic but instead to fill a niche of customers who are looking for a stable monthly expense without the hassle of monitoring minutes used. An interesting statistic is that 85% of the firms customers use their service as the primary phone line, bypassing the traditional land line model.The stock has experienced a very rough 2 quarters falling from its high in June above $40 to its current price near $16. The decline is largely due to concern over how a slowing (or possibly contracting) economy will affect the company. Since most of PCS’ customers fit into the lower end of the earnings spectrum, it is logical to assume that PCS may have a more difficult time landing new customers if employment levels decline. Management combats this assumption by stating that in depressed economic times, they expect to win market share as their plans are more affordable and offer stability compared to their competition. Also, phone service is one of the last items that a consumer would be willing to cut if budget issues become tight. This may be true, but it is difficult to see how such an environment will benefit PCS instead of just hurting it less than the larger carriers.Looking forward, management has laid out plans to add 1.25 -1.52 million net subscribers in 2008. This is an attractive growth rate but the numbers were somewhat dampened when management also stated that they believed an economic slowdown could result in 23-30% reductions in net additions during the fourth quarter of 2007. While the fourth quarter (and the first quarter as well) are strong seasonal periods for additional customers, any difficulty during these periods may continue to pressure the stock once the numbers are reported. Also it appears a bit naive to think that the economic slowdown will only impact fourth quarter numbers as the lingering effects of a housing downturn and lower credit availability should dampen consumer spending (especially on the low end of the income scale)Despite its incredible drop, the stock is now trading at nearly 30 times this year’s earnings. Coincidentally, this years consensus numbers are equivalent to the 2007 consensus numbers (the company is scheduled to report the fourth quarter on Feb 27). Multiples in this level are reserved for growth companies and while PCS has shown growth in the past, it is definitely bumping up against some challenges that could lead earnings to be flat for some time. $16.00 per share appears to be a steep price to pay at this time considering the risks and challenges present."
97786,22262,2008-09-29T09:06:25-04:00,,"The massive drop in stock prices due to concerns about the consumer spending environment and the broader economy has created some interesting long opportunities among companies that should be well-insulated from economic woes.Dallas-based MetroPCS (PCS) is one of these.  The company is a provider of unlimited wireless communications service for a flat-rate with no signed contract.  MetroPCS owns or has access to licenses covering a population of approximately 149 million people in 14 of the top 25 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, including New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Miami, Orlando, Sarasota, Tampa, Atlanta, Dallas, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. As of Q2 2008, the company had 4.6 million subscribers, up from 3.6 million in Q2 2007.1. Customer base is somewhat insulated from economyWireless communication has quickly become a basic need, right next to food, water, shelter and housing.  There are a lot of things people will give up before ditching their main connection to the rest of the world.  Importantly, on MetroPCS’s Q2 2008 earnings call, management stated that approximately 60% of subscribers do not own landlines, making it highly unlikely they will churn.Also, in tough economic times, people may choose to “trade down” from Verizon (NYSE:VZ) or AT&T (NYSE:T) to a cheaper, commitment-free MetroPCS plan.Thus, PCS’s addressable market may actually increase as the economy contracts, and, at the very least, should be secure.  Even though its customers are typically lower income with poor credit, the low price point, flexible service plan and lack of credit risk make the MetroPCS offering quite attractive.  Furthermore, the new family plan offering will diversify the customer base to “safer” demographics which should have a positive effect on customer lifetime value and churn.2. Compelling service offering in difficult times highlights attractive unit economicsMetroPCS plans run from $30-$50 per month, dramatically lower than the national carriers. It is able to do this for a few reasons:Despite the relatively low ARPU, MetroPCS’s customer economics are extremely compelling.  At its current churn levels, a typical customer is worth between $800 and $1,000 while costing approximately $135 to acquire.3. Launches of NY, Philadelphia, Las Vegas and Boston will drive growthPCS’s growth strategy is simple – buy licenses in large metropolitan markets, build network infrastructure, market the product and acquire customers cheaply.  It has successfully executed this in over a dozen markets, achieving penetration rates in excess of 12%.The company entered Las Vegas in Q108 and Philadelphia in Q208 – both significantly ahead of schedule – and plans to enter the New York and Boston markets within the next 9 months.  These new markets will almost double the potential customer base, and should provide a tremendous avenue for continued revenue growth.Moreover, as these markets mature, the strong cash flow dynamics of mature markets will begin to shine through.  Maintenance capital expenditure requirements are relatively low, and customer acquisition costs decrease with lower churn.4. ‘Houdini’ is undervaluedMetroPCS launched MetroFlash – a product that allows owners of CDMA phones (read: Verizon and Sprint (NYSE:S) customers) to have their phones reprogrammed for compatibility with the MetroPCS network.  This is based on Houdini software licensed from the founder of quasi-competitor Pocket Communications.Wall Street has ascribed no gross subscriber addition uplift to this announcement, which is a mistake.  Combined with the reasons outlined above, this product has the potential to allow PCS to substantially exceed estimates.5. Analyst estimates are conservativeAfter a slight miss on gross subscriber ads in Q2, the stock fell substantially on concerns that PCS’s customer base would be disproportionately affected by an economic slowdown.  Analyst estimates were revised downwards.  I believe this is incorrect.  In addition to the reasons listed above, the launch of new markets (Las Vegas, Los Angeles, etc.) typically coincides with high gross adds and high churn.Instead, Q2 showed low churn and lower-than-expected gross adds.  This was likely due to the Tax Relief Check hitting consumer wallets in Q1, which artificially increased Q1 performance and created difficult Q2 comps.Now, with estimates revised downwards, PCS looks poised to beat projections on both gross adds and churn.  Clearly, this will be mitigated to a certain extent by the macroeconomic challenges facing the company, but I believe this risk is already priced in.6. Downside is limited by asset valueMetroPCS holds significant PCS and AWS spectrum assets and network assets.PCS auctions over the past 10 years have yielded average prices of about $1.25 per MHz-POP for large metropolitan environments (1-2 million) and $2.75 per MHz-POP for urban environments (2+ million).  This implies a value of $2.5 billion for MetroPCS’s PCS spectrum.AWS auctions over the past 10 years have yielded average prices of about $0.33 per MHz-POP for large metropolitan environments (1-2 million) and $0.65 per MHz-POP for urban environments (2+ million).  The January 2008 AWS auction is a good benchmark.  This implies a value of about $660 million for MetroPCS’s AWS spectrum.By my calculations, MetroPCS’s spectrum assets are worth north of $3 billion (however, MetroPCS carries them at $2.4 billion on its balance sheet).  Add this to $1.1 billion in cash, $2.3 billion in network equipment and other PP&E, and $300 million in other short- and long-term assets, and MetroPCS is trading close to book value.1. iPhone could change the gameIt is hard to ignore the recent success of converged mobile devices, most prominently the iPhone.  If consumer demand shifts significantly towards these, MetroPCS will be in trouble.  The company does not offer feature-rich smart phones, and its network is not optimized for them (though its current customers have very high MOUs).2. Significant debt burdenMetroPCS is financed with $3 billion in debt, and requires a substantial amount of leverage to continue growth.  This primarily consists of $1.4 billion in 9.25% Senior Notes due in 2014, a $1.6 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility at an annual rate of 7.17% through 2011.  The interest burden from these was $109 million in the first half of 2008.With $1.1 billion in cash, liquidity is not a concern, yet access to capital could impact ability to sustain growth.  This concern will be accelerated if the company decides to purchase significant new spectrum.3. New network builds consume all free cash flowPCS is in an aggressive expansion phase. Until the major builds in New York and Boston are completed, expansion capex will consume most of the company’s free cash flow.  Additional purchases of spectrum will also consume cash.In the first six months of 2008, PCS generated $331 million of operating cash flow, and spent $389 million on PP&E.Still, maintenance capex is relatively low after the initial 18 month network build, leading to attractive long term cash flow characteristics.4. CompetitionMetroPCS competes with major national carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, and regional carriers such as Leap Wireless (Cricket) and Pocket Communications.However, MetroPCS’s service offerings are sufficiently differentiated from national carriers by price point, service offering, billing method and contractual commitment that it faces little direct competition in its low-end segment.  Regional carriers often do not attempt to compete directly due to significant first-mover advantages and far higher ROI’s in non-competitive markets.5. Core market growth may be slowingAlmost all of recent subscriber adds have come from MetroPCS’s expansion markets, suggesting that additional penetration into core markets may be limited.  Out-year estimates from the Street do not suggest significant expansion in these markets, but would still cause downside pressure on long-term projections.  However, growth in expansion markets has been ahead of expectations.  This suggests the attractiveness of the PCS offering in a difficult market, which will provide support if issues within the core markets persist.Simply put, MetroPCS is cheap.At Friday’s closing price of $13.90, the company trades at 8.6x and 6.5x consensus 2008 and 2009 EBITDA, respectively, while growing EBITDA by over 30% (if you believe Street estimates).  Leap Wireless, the best public comparable, trades at 10.4x and 8.0x, respectively, while growing EBITDA at a slightly slower pace (LEAP also has worse unit economics). Verizon and AT&T trade at an average of 5.4x and 5.0x respectively, while growing EBITDA at an average of 7.7% (and dealing with difficulties in wireline and triple-play).A conservative discounted cash flow analysis using a 15% discount rate yields values of $20.29 to $24.96, implying upside of 46% to 79.6%.Disclosure:  I am long MetroPCS."
54165,20181,2007-11-14T07:16:03-05:00,,"Discount wireless provider MetroPCS Communications Inc. reported an 82% rise in Q3 profit on a 41% increase in total revenue. Net income was $53.1 million, good for EPS of $0.15, versus net of $29.3 million (EPS of $0.08) a year ago. Total revenue was $557 million, while quarterly service revenue increased 47% to $489 million. Consensus analyst estimates were for EPS of $0.13 on total revenue of $562 million. The company projects net subscriber additions of between 1.25 million and 1.52 million in Q4; it added 114,000 net customers in the recent quarter, which is traditionally the company's weakest.

39753,20856,2007-06-29T06:56:50-04:00,,"Tired of unpleasant surprises when opening cell phone bills? Metro PCS (PCS) has the solution. The company offers only pre-paid unlimited calling and data plans so the monthly check is the same every time. PCS also benefits from the non-traditional format because all revenues are pre-paid and the company does not have to worry about allowing for bad debt or wondering if customers will pay for service they have already used.
The pre-paid service has another distinct advantage for the company because it can offer services to anyone without having to run a credit check or verify the customer's ability to maintain a contract. Bear Stearns has noted that the company's exposure to illegal immigrants is larger than most carriers because it doesn't have to do background checks on clients. This is also a factor of the company operating in markets where immigration is more prevalent.
Currently, PCS's footprint covers 7 of the top 25 US markets. Typically the company rolls out one city at a time keeping costs in check and allowing them to concentrate on bringing the new market up to speed quickly. The next few years should bring many notable cities online including NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, and Las Vegas. The rollout should allow the company to continue its trend of strong revenue growth that spans many quarters. Baird believes the company's IPO in April raised enough capital ($862.5m) to fund this growth without additional capital infusions. Thomas Weisel believes they may need to raise a bit more capital but is still bullish on the name.
At this point, the average Cost Per Gross Addition (CPGA or cost of adding a new subscriber) is lower than any competitor at roughly $100 and the operating costs per subscriber also remain below the industry norm. This allows the company to realize great profitability even though their churn rate (percentage of customers dropping their service) is significantly above the industry average. Keeping costs in line will be key as the company continues to roll out service in increasingly competitive markets.
Analysts site some concerns revolving around spectrum that the company will use in its expansion. The FCC auctioned off this spectrum but there could be some timing issues as to when PCS will be able to take advantage of this asset it purchased. New hardware will have to be installed and some current users of the spectrum will have to be removed. Any delay could be negative for the company so this will need to be monitored.
All in all, the future looks rosy for the company and with the stock only being available for the last 2-3 months, there is likely pent up demand for the company. Much of the stock was issued to private equity holders who agreed to a 180 day lockup. This may cause some overhang in supply of the stock but if the market is healthy and the company continues to execute, this will only have a muted effect on the shares. 
Disclosure: I have a long position and will likely add more in the future."
32684,20525,2007-04-18T07:35:19-04:00,,"MetroPCS (PCS) is going public this week. I like its business model focusing on 'under-served markets' in large Metro areas with an unlimited minutes package and no contractual obligations. There is bound to be a lot of growth in this niche and MetroPCS are looking well positioned. A fast look at some fundamental business metrics vs the giant Cingular/AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) compares well: (thanks to Keith McMahon for Cingular/VZW data)  Churn is a little high (and I guess expected given the no-contract model) and with user acquisition costs of $120 it's taking over a year to break even on a new customer. However, average user revenue is comparable to Cingular and Verizon and margins are healthy showing that allowing unlimited calling for your customers doesn't cost all that much. Growth is a major bright spot, and this company is only getting started! The main competitive pressure is MVNO's (Mobile Virtual Network Operators sitting on Verizon's network) moving in with similar business models but less fixed costs. But the lower bound of an MVNO's price structure is determined by the deal they can make with Verizon and this will limit how competitive they can be."

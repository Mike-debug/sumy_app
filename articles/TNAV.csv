Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are their main customers, representing 55% and 18% of total revenue in FY2019, respectively. The big question that we have to ask is - will Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) replace Telenav? In September 2019, Google and General Motors announced that they are working together to install Google’s voice assistant and apps into GM vehicles beginning in 2021. Telenav's stock promptly fell by 44.8% on that same day. Investors realize the potential impact and what this deal could mean for Telenav. Our analysis on the current state of affairs and dynamics of the infotainment industry lead us to believe that the sharp decline was unwarranted, especially seeing that the current price is 124.4% lower than its 52-week high. From our analysis, we believe that the company has more to offer and will stay relevant to continue working with their current partners. Investors with large risk appetites and long investment horizon could consider adding this stock to their portfolio.Side Note: I will follow up on the firm’s financial analysis and projections, so follow me to keep updated.First, let us tackle the issue with today’s infotainment market. The automotive industry is confronting a widening and unsustainable gap between software complexity and production capabilities. What this means is that OEMs are not able to produce software that match consumers’ demand. This resulted in security concerns as well with reports of hackers being able to access locks, brake systems, and dashboard displayers remotely via the cloud in several car models. History has shown that tech companies are way better suited to producing high quality software to serve customers’ needs best.Source: McKinseyPreviously, Google (Android Automotive) was working with Volvo (OTCPK:VOLAF) (OTCPK:VOLVY) (under Polestar 2, an EV to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)) and Audi (OTCPK:AUDVF). To be fair, both the infotainment system and cars are prototypes starting production in 2020. In the latest partnership announcement, Google and Ford both mentioned that the contract is not exclusive, meaning Ford can continue working with Telenav. But we recognize that the threat is real and potentially disruptive to the current market because of Google’s advancement and innovation capabilities. Google’s system boasts the ability to allow consumers to adjust heat and turn off seat warmers in a vehicle via Google Assistant. The platform is designed to be customizable to suit different automobile styles. Many investors believe, with some merit, that it is inevitable for Google's or some other tech giant’s infotainment system to be in every vehicle. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or some other cloud provider could swoop into the infotainment space with their software expertise and cloud solutions to dominate entire OEMs. However, as explained in a later section, we believe that this is an unlikely case.When asked if Volvo could seek other solutions for other cars while retaining Android Auto on certain cars, Patrick Brady (head of Android Auto) explains it by drawing parallel to mobile phones.He explains that OEMs generally do not want to have a bunch of different infotainment systems across different cars because of the high investment and related costs. And we agree with him, but there is more to it than just expenses.Another factor that drives (no pun intended) OEMs is their long-term vision of being valued automotive leaders. OEMs want to avoid becoming a low-margin hardware producing factory that provides no additional value to customers. The second that happens, automobile brands will no longer have the same power and influence they have today. On the extreme end, we could even see tech companies catching up to the hardware production aspect and eventually taking over today’s OEMs. We would like to believe that this is unlikely due to the sophisticated expertise required to design and build an automobile. For example, we saw Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) trying to build their own self-driving cars but failed and eventually shifted to focus on self-driving software instead. Given that OEMs are highly motivated to not become dinosaurs, a solution would be to band together. HERE is a map database owned by a consortium of OEMs including Audi, BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), and Mercedes. In fact, HERE provides the map data for Telenav’s navigation solutions. We believe that it would be in Telenav’s best interest to work with Ford and General Motors to come up with other solutions. This would resolve the widening consumer expectance-solutions gap while protecting the value of OEMs, as OEMs now have indirect control and influence over these solutions. Jeff MacDuff at Inrix, a location-based data and analytics firm, agrees that automakers won't want to give up this data.Tesla has proved that it is possible to deliver an incredible vehicle and software that meets the need of today’s consumers without working with Google or Apple. OEMs would strive to work towards replicating Tesla’s success.The other important aspect of this equation is whether Telenav can deliver to be that solution provider which fits right in the sweet spot of advancing OEMs’ software while protecting their interests. We see this through the partnership with HERE (owned by a consortium of OEMs). The core products of Telenav are on-board navigation systems built into vehicles and navigation SDKs that enable clients to add mapping and location capabilities to their own on-board automotive applications. Let us look at Telenav’s strategy for the future to determine if Telenav can provide relevant solutions.Source: Company Investor PresentationThere are 3 focus areas:1) In-Car SW/Service: The company plans to release Full IVI VIVID, an aftermarket in-vehicle infotainment. The product will integrate internet-based entertainment services, including Alexa voice assistant, and integrated vehicle functions. In a bid to launch quickly and to reach a greater number of end users, the company announced a partnership with Alpine to offer the VIVID infotainment system via an USB stick that consumers can simply plug into any compatible systems. This would allow a greater number of customers to access the VIVID system in their existing cars, whereas traditionally, customers would have to wait for the system to come with new cars.Source: Company Website2) In-Car Commerce & Communication: The company plans to increase their number of partnerships to offer more services to consumers. For example, a customer could order a cup of coffee from the nearest Starbucks right off their system. The company recently partnered with motion auto to provide insurance services. These partnerships could provide additional streams of revenue for Telenav and OEMs.Source: Company Investor Presentation3) Road Intelligence: The company provides location and driving data-based analysis and statistics to clients such as GrabTaxi (GRAB), Toyota (NYSE:TM), Mercedes and Bosch.Now, let us see how Telenav’s strategy might play out. First, we believe that the core business of Telenav will, as much as critics disagree, continue to grow with increasing adoption rates. Reason being this solution allows OEMs to produce their own navigation applications and solutions, therefore protecting their interest. From their latest quarterly report, Telenav has shown an increasing adoption rate for their solutions.Source: Company Quarterly ReportAs for the play on their infotainment system, we believe that it will work too. Now, we have to be very careful here; Telenav cannot completely disconnect with OEMs when coming out with their product as they would be categorized as a threat, similar to how Google is. We believe this possibility to be low; the company has built strong relationships with OEMs and should capitalize on their partnerships to further pursue solutions together. We predict that one of two things could happen in the future - VIVID or other solutions run in cars without drawing attention to their brand, or a consortium of OEM acquires Telenav. In either situation, Telenav stands to gain.While we believe that not all strategies might play out the way the company hopes they do, Telenav should be able to compete in the market by staying relevant. The company has long realized that it has to keep innovating and has not been afraid to do so.On 7th January 2020, Ford and Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) announced a partnership that will see Garmin cloud-based navigation technology integrated into Ford’s next gen Sync infotainment system in the Mustang Mach-E EV. Telenav’s stock price fell by 8% on that same day. Now, we believe that this represents a greater threat to Telenav than Google does. The underlying motivation for this collaboration is that Ford needed someone to provide navigation solutions which encompasses EV-specific solutions such as looking for the nearest charging point. The way we see this is that Garmin will probably only be featured on Ford’s EV vehicles. We hope to see Telenav catching up in this space but understand the potential downside involved.It would be a big bet that OEMs stick with Telenav instead of Google and that the collaboration with Garmin is only one-off. We recommend that only investors with enormous risk appetite invest in this company, otherwise investors should stay on the sidelines for now to see how this plays out. That being said, we believe that the downside might be already protected to a certain degree because of the sharp decline in September 2019; investors can place some put options to further protect their downside. I will follow up with this company to further delve into the firm’s financials and projections to determine investment entry and exit points. Follow me to receive notifications when that happens!On the flip side, we might ponder, is there really a need to build a sophisticated system in the first place? Could it be the status quo of you to connect your phone to it while providing just the essential apps and services works best for all parties? If there are multiple drivers for the same car, security might be a concern if anyone can access our messages and personal details.Co-existing might be a possibility. This might be harder to picture, but perhaps Google could integrate only some part of their ecosystem which would result in a slight improvement from today’s systems."
4308612,101801,2019-11-22T12:50:07-05:00,"Telenav has lost 50% of its valuation in a market since an unexpected announcement in early September.However, the CEO just made some significant purchases, the company has a rock-solid balance sheet and is cheap on a price to sales basis.We take a look at the investment case for this beaten-down, small-cap tech stock in the paragraphs below.","Today, we take a look at small tech stock that lost almost 50% of its value in one day in early September on an unexpected development. The CEO just made a significant purchase in the shares, and the company recently posted Q3 results. We take a look at this $5 small-cap concern in the paragraphs below.Telenav, Inc. (TNAV) is a Santa Clara, California based provider of location-based services and products for connected cars and advertising. These offerings are provided through the company's car and advertising platforms and include GPS satellite navigation, local search, automotive navigation solutions, and mobile advertising. Telenav was primarily a mobile navigation and advertising business a decade ago but now derives most of its revenue from Ford (F), as well as other automobile manufacturers and Tier 1 suppliers. Telenav was founded in 1999 and went public in 2010, raising net proceeds of $44.6 million at $8 per share. The company operates on a fiscal year (FY) ending June 30th. Its market cap is currently is approximately $260 million.GM Announcement:Telenav plunged some 45% in early September after General Motors (GM) announced that it will build Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) apps directly into its vehicles' touchscreen displays. Investors took this news as a direct threat to Telenav which offers GPS navigation, search, infotainment, and mobile advertising on its platforms.However, Google Apps will not made available in GM cars until the 2021 model year at the earliest. In addition, Telenav still has a partnership and contract with GM through the 2025 model year. Finally, GM represents just 18% of the company's overall revenues at the moment. The company came out almost immediately with an announcement that this unexpected development will not affect its profit forecasts for 2019, 2020, or 2021 as it reiterated its previous guidance.First Quarter Results:The company had a mixed first quarter report posted earlier this month (the company operates on a different fiscal year than most). The company loss per share was 13 cents, about four cents a share below the consensus. More importantly, revenue growth of nearly 40% on a year-over-year basis saw the company take in nearly $65 million in sales during the quarter. This was nearly $2 million over expectations.Source: Company PresentationThe GAAP loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $(2.1) million compared with $(6.1) million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The company ended the quarter with over $120 million in cash and marketable securities on the balance. Telenav has no debt.Insider Buying & Analyst Activity:The company's CEO purchased 150,000 shares in equal installment in three installments from November 18th through November 20th. It was the first insider activity in the stock since this individual purchase 60,000 shares (at much higher prices) in mid-August.Analysts are not as sanguine on the shares. Since the GM announcement, two analyst firms (Craig-Hallum and Northland Securities) have slapped Hold ratings on the stock, while only B. Riley FBR ($6.50 price target) has reissued a Buy rating.I still have a small speculative position in Telenav. Roughly half the company's market cap is represented by cash on the balance sheet. Taking that out, the stock seems cheap from a price to sales basis. Despite analyst pessimism, the sell-off on the GM announcement does seem overdone. Something the CEO seems to concur with given recent purchases. The stock might have also formed a bottom just under current trading levels."
4313175,105040,2019-12-18T13:38:32-05:00,"Telenav recently dropped substantially on threat of competition from Google, which recently signed a deal with GM.However, we think the reaction is overdone as there is room for both companies.Telenav also has substantial cash reserves totaling half its market cap, which it is investing into growth initiatives.The valuation isn't high, and the CEO recently bought shares.","We started getting interested in Telenav (NASDAQ:TNAV) after it recently dropped over 40% due to an announcement that Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) had signed GM (NYSE:GM) as a partner. After looking into the company more, we decided that, while the competition was a threat, Telenav's prospects are still bright and mostly unaffected by the announcement. It also helps that Telenav is cash-rich, growing fast and on the brink of profitability. Overall, at its current price, Telenav looks like it could be an interesting buy.Telenav is a leading provider of location-based products and services for connected cars, with over 16mil installed connected vehicles as of Q1 2020. It offers a suite of connected car services like infotainment, ADAS, and in-car commerce.Telenav also had an advertising business that delivered highly targeted advertising services through their network of connected cars, but they sold the Ads Business to inMarket Media, a provider of digital advertising services in exchange for a 14.5% interest in inMarket. inMarket also granted to Telenav a perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, license back to the software and other intellectual property rights being assigned to inMarket as part of the inMarket Transaction.On September 5, Telenav cratered over 40% after GM announced that it was introducing Google Automotive Solutions into its in-car infotainment system starting 2021. However, management has mentioned that they don't anticipate any near-term financial impact as a result of this announcement and continues to believe that they will ramp with the GM through 2021 and derive revenue under their GM contract through 2025.While the new competition may reduce revenues with GM after 2021, we don't think it warrants such a massive decline in market cap. Google's solution does have its problems - for example, it doesn't support certain kinds of hardware, and unlike Telenav, Google doesn't share data with its automotive partners. We believe Telenav will still get a good share of GM's business even with the extra competition.Fundamentally, Telenav is still a strong player in the fast-growing connected car market, with major automakers like Ford (NYSE:F), GM and Toyota (NYSE:TM) being clients.The company has also signed deals with companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Grab, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), proving that its connected car platform is quite valuable.Source: Q1 2020 presentationTelenav has around $122mil in net cash on its balance sheet, representing about 50% of the market cap. The company had announced a couple of investments in the last couple of quarters, and management will likely continue to look for inorganic opportunities to bolster Telenav's connected car platform in the future.Telenav hit a number of significant milestones in Q1, with the most notable being that it finally became adjusted EBITDA positive. It grew revenue by 39% and expanded gross margins by 2.4 points YOY.The strong performance this quarter was mainly attributable to the Grab deal, which helped contribute $12.5mil, and continued ramp-up of GM, allowing the company to beat estimates substantially. While management has guided for billings to show slower growth for the rest of the year as the Grab transactions fades and because of the GM strikes, there should still be continued growth for the next few years as the company continues to ramp with GM and Ford.With its strong operating leverage (even excluding the Grab transaction) and fast-growing revenues, we think profitability and cash flow should improve drastically in the quarters ahead.Another growth driver could be the growth in the number of connected cars on the marketplace, which should help increase future service revenues.Overall, the company continues to improve revenues and profitability as they invest in growth, including an investment into Moove.ai this quarter.Telenav currently trades at a $230mil market cap, but with the large cash position, EV is around $110mil. This represents around 1/3 EV/Bookings, which seems incredibly low for a growing company which has products that are proven to be valuable.We should also note that the CEO recently bought over $700k worth of shares, increasing his already large position further, showing a massive display of confidence in the company's future prospects.Source: insiderinsightsOverall, the massive drop in Telenav may be an opportunity to get a cash-rich, fast-growing company at a low valuation. The platform is quite valuable, given the deals Telenav has already signed, and it should only become more valuable as the number of connected cars increases. As the market realizes how valuable the platform is, we expect the valuation to increase over the long run."
4323326,105040,2020-02-11T22:17:59-05:00,"Telenav had a blowout earnings report that beat all of its expectations substantially.It has strong growth potential in the massive connected car market.With 50% of its market cap in cash, the valuation of its profitable core business is incredibly cheap.","It has been an absolutely fantastic earnings report for Telenav's (TNAV) investors. Management has substantially outperformed its own estimates and generated record results, sending the stock up nearly 30%.Source: Google imagesDespite this massive rise, we believe Telenav is still deeply undervalued due to its strong position in a fast-growing industry, as well as its large cash hoard. We believe there is major potential for further price appreciation.Looking at the Q2 numbers, we really aren't surprised that the stock has risen so much. Telenav beat on pretty much all metrics by an enormous margin.Revenue, for example, beat management guidance by 16%, reaching a 5-year high. Both product and service revenue performed very well this quarter, which management attributed to strength in the automotive industry. Most impressively, though, Telenav was much more profitable than even management's most optimistic expectations. In Q1, management believed that adjusted EBITDA would be ($1.5-3.5 million) in Q2, yet the company actually reported $7.8 million in adjusted EBITDA.This quarter, Telenav not only solidified its dominant position with Ford (NYSE:F), but also signed a competitive new contract with a Japanese OEM and became a key supplier for the new GM Cadillac Escalade.Not only that, but it also announced that it is signing an agreement with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and making an investment into Synq3, an in-car commerce company. We believe the fact that Telenav has been able to do all this just shows that its product is incredibly competitive and unique.The future is looking very bright as well. With a large $1 billion backlog, much of which will be recognized within the next few years, Telenav's revenues for the next few years should be quite stable and may even grow if Telenav signs new contracts.The large cash pile managed to grow this quarter. Now, Telenav has around $130 million in cash and $20 million in investments, still representing over half of its much higher $300 million market cap. This cash pile provides a large margin of safety for prospective Telenav investors.In recent years, the penetration of navigation software and services continues to increase and in-vehicle infotainment systems continue to grow more complex. Telenav is a major player in this industry and currently has the highest market share for navigation software and services in North America.With navigation systems being a primary application in connected vehicles, Telenav's navigation advantage clearly positions it to become a key player in the $500-billion connected car market in 2030.Source: investor presentationWith its over 17 million connected vehicles growing at a 59% CAGR, Telenav not only has access to substantial amounts of valuable data, but also has a nice recurring revenue source. We believe this large installed base is a key competitive advantage for Telenav and should help it to solidify its footing in this competitive industry.Source: investor presentationInternational markets, in particular, represent a major opportunity. While Telenav has a leading position in the US, it still has very little market share internationally. However, these markets represent huge opportunities - China, for example, sells twice the amount of cars than the US.Source: investor presentationAs connected cars become more of a necessity, we believe Telenav's solution will become more and more valuable for automakers. So far, only a few automakers like Ford have made Telenav a preferred supplier, but as the popularity of connected cars continues to grow, Telenav should be able to gain more clients and generate more billings.With Telenav now profitable, the undervaluation of the core business is now much more apparent. Even management has called out this in its investor presentations, showing that Telenav trades at a discount to all of its peers despite having one of the highest growth rates.Source: investor presentationEven with the recent rise in valuation, Telenav still trades at a massive discount to most peers. We believe the cash hoard is suppressing the value of the core business. If management pays out part of the cash to investors, we believe the value of the core business will become more apparent, thus improving Telenav's valuation.We believe the main risk for Telenav's business is competition. While management has done well getting contracts from both domestic and foreign automakers, there is still a risk that a company with better technology could come by and capture market share from Telenav.Overall, Telenav is still incredibly cheap even with the share price appreciation after the recent report. The core business is now still only worth around $150 million despite having a $1 billion backlog, strong growth prospects, and profitability. As the bull case continues to play out, we believe the valuation of Telenav should continue to grow."
3169116,75665,2015-05-11T12:07:59-04:00,"Initiatives to remake the company are bearing fruit with three quarters of sequential revenue growth.Adds General Motors to client list that already includes Ford ensuring over 19% share of world embedded navigation.Gartner's ""Cool Vendor Mobile Marketing for 2015"".","Telenav (NASDAQ:TNAV) is a must own stock in the Internet of Things, IoT, and an under-owned story, with a significant upside. The company is a known leader in personalized navigation and over the past two years has remade itself by embracing crowd sourced mapping to become a force in the connected car and mobile advertising. As a result of these initiatives, the company last week announced its third consecutive quarter of revenue growth with a roadmap to double revenue in 18 months. The connected car is already the largest revenue source for the company and Ford (NYSE:F) is its largest client accounting for over 50% of Q3 2015 revenue. Capitalizing on its success with Ford the company recently added General Motors (NYSE:GM) as a client and expects that GM will track Ford's adoption of Telenav navigation platform.The Company's second major corporate initiative, Thinknear, is in the rapidly growing location advertising business. Revenues for Thinknear contribute about $4M for the quarter and are up ninety percent year over year. The company's success and innovation are starting to be noticed. It was recently awarded ""Cool Vendor Mobile Marketing for 2015"" - by Gartner, and was one of four companies singled out for driving innovation in the mobile marketing space.The CompanyTelenav describes itself as the leader in personalized navigation. The Sunnyvale, CA company was founded in 2001 and its legacy business is a turn-by-turn premium mobile navigation app distributed by carrier partners including AT&T (NYSE:T), Sprint (NYSE:S), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and US Cellular (NYSE:USM). This business in the most recent quarter, Q3 2015, accounted for 21% of revenue. However, the business has been declining for several years. Two years ago the company began implementing a strategy centered on the connected car and location based mobile advertising. These two initiates now account for 79% of the $42.3M Q3 2015 revenue. Total revenue for the company was up six percent sequentially in Q3 2015 and up 23% year-over-year. Revenue from the connected car was $29M up 22% sequentially and 60% year-over-year.Company revenue in 2014 was $150.3M down from $191M in 2013 also entirely attributable to the fall in revenue from carrier partner navigation business. Last week, the company reported its third consecutive quarter revenue increase overcoming a $2.4M sequential quarterly decrease in the carrier partner business.New DirectionThe first tangible step in Telenav's implementation of the new businesses plan came with the purchase of Skobbler in January, 2014, for $24M. Skobbler, based in German was started in 2008, to work with OpenStreetMap, OSM. The acquisition of Skobbler, was important for three reasons. First the company gained key personnel and technology by formally incorporating OSM into their car and advertising offerings. Second it extended its mapping footprint globally - a key selling point to global clients like Ford who want a single global navigation solution. And third, OSM data free and quickly being recognized a superior to other sources.OpenStreetMapOpenStreetMap, OSM, was founded in 2008 by Steve Coast who now is head of OSM at Telenav. It is a Wiki much like Wikipedia and Lynx. The concept behind OpenStreetMap centers on ""common-space peer production, non-monetary peer production with discrete multi-piece data at lost cost integration."" In other words thousands of people using their own GPS devices travel the world to help map of roads and landmarks. In a 2014 conference, Steve Coast said that over 127,000 people were registered with OpenStreetMap, observing, reporting changes and uploading pictures to the site. A cycle of geodata enhancements providing a daily updated street map of the world. Steve Coast started the project with a mapping party of the Isle of Wright and still leads mapping parties for fun.The OpenStreetMap is a direct rival to proprietary mapmakers like Google Maps (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing Maps, and it offers significant advantages. OSM data/maps updates detailing route changes, bridge outages, new roads and scene pictures are uploaded and posted daily - for anyone to use. Proprietary services using paid employees may take months to update their data base. Timely updates are very important in turn-by-turn navigation where a road closure/detour is not incorporated as the best route.Telenav is not the only company using OSM data to upgrade it turn-by-turn navigation offerings daily through the cloud. Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) uses OSM for its geodata as well as many other startups specializing in off-line and on-line hiking, cycling and driving navigation.Crowdsourced OSM data is now at the center for Telenav's auto, advertising and carrier partner businesses. The company points out that dependable/accurate data is critical as cars become more autonomous and learn to sense their surroundings. Click through rates are also enhanced by accurate position data and a differentiating offering in their mobile advertising product. For many OSM data is attractive attribute is simply because not sourced from Google or Microsoft.The CarThe connected car or Internet of the Car, IoC, is bringing a multitude of features into the car dashboard. Cloud based connectivity enhances driving safety, navigation, entertainment and offers a platform for location based advertising. Telenav already participates in this market with Ford, its largest client at $29M in revenue in Q3 2015. The company receives an embedding fee for each Ford car as well as on going subscriber royalty fees. Every Ford and Lincoln car sold in the US carries Telenav navigation. Ford models in China, Europe, South America and Australia/New Zealand also offer Telenav navigation. Ford accounts for 68% of Telenav revenue today. Telenav's Q3 2015 loyalty revenue was 13% of total Ford revenue up 25% year-over-year.A few months ago Telenav announced that General Motors would follow the Ford model. General Motors had been using Microsoft's Bing Maps for turn-by-turn navigation. The GM business will begin with Telenav's phone based turn-by-turn off board navigation app, in the 2016 model year. The full embedded solution will be rolled out with the 2017 model year.Management is confident they have just started to land OEM business. Their goal is to have the largest network of connected cars in the world and going forward will leverage embedded connected car navigation with added software and services. In January the company opened an office in Japan to join offices in Europe, China and North America. Ford and GM together represent 18 percent of the global car market.Location-Based Mobile AdvertisingThe connected car and smart phones are providing advertisers with a growing opportunity to personalize ad spending. In the month of December 2014 there were 257 billion mobile ad impressions up from 240 billion in March 2014. Telenav's Thinknear solution is building on this phenomenon. In 2012 only 10% of mobile advertising used location based targeting - in 2014 this increased to 68%. Location intelligence can target customers with relevant and timely advertising and Thinknear can measure its impact on user behavior by counting click through rates, CTR, and conversion rates of individual ads. The company launched its Location Score Index in May 2014 to provide marketers with a way to measure the quality of their mobile offering. The Thinknear platform increases CTR by twenty five percent and lifts conversion rates eighty one percent.Location accuracy and precision are the key to the product. The company estimates that Food/Drink advertisers obtained a 50% increase in CTR rates followed by retail at 34%, entertainment at 11% and auto at six percent. Conversion rates with GPS advertising where more impressive with Food/Drink at 2.18, retail 2.13, entertainment 1.67 and auto 1.63 over a base of 1.00.Telenav says its just starting to build the team to evangelize the Thinknear product and the results are significant with $4M in billings in Q3 2015 - up 38% year-over-year - with increased guidance.Legacy businessPremium navigation offered under the name of mobile carriers AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and US Cellular provided a significant yet decreasing revenue stream of about $8M in Q3 2015. The carriers charge subscribers directly for service with Telenav receiving a per subscriber fee.ScoutScout is the trade name for the company's navigation app offered on the iPhone and Android platforms. Scout Plus is a premium offering for $24.99 a year or $4.99 a month. Scout navigation can be used on line or off line. The company called the product important but not a meaningful revenue source. It does provide the company with first party data collection.Scout SDKIn May 2014 Telenav launched Scout SDK a free commercial grade navigation for mobile app developers based on OpenStreetMap. It combines off line and on line navigation. Strava Corporation will be one of the first companies to use Scout Maps in the company's cycling and running maps.The StockTelenav has about 40M shares outstanding with a market cap of $350M. In 2011, at the peak of their carrier partner revenues, TNAV shares briefly traded above $20. Since then the share price has followed carrier partner revenue down and in 2014 the stock traded as low as $4.70. There are about one million shares short. Following last week's Q3 earnings report the stock spiked $.90 to $9.15. Two brokers follow the stock with one at buy and one at hold. The highest target price is $11 according to Yahoo Finance.SummaryEmbedded OEM navigation solutions with three of the top ten global automakers and a growing location based mobile advertising product leveraging free OpenStreetMap data. The new direction has been key to turning around the one time high flying company. It's now possible to see revenue growing 2x in 18 months as the GM and China OEM business grow to match the Ford business. Add on the location base mobile advertising platform growing thirty eight percent year over year and we should see revenues growing by much more an 2x in 18 months.ConclusionThe internet of things has a number of winners; cloud services, mobile devices, embedded chip, data transportation, networks builders, and content providers are all riding the wave that is IoT. Important in that mix are providers of new sources of accurate navigation and efficient marketing. Telenav provides coming solutions in both businesses with a scalable business plan. I am a buyer of TNAV up to $15 a share."

Its Q2 FY2015 loss per share of $0.08 was significantly better than consensus loss per share estimates of $0.16, while its quarterly sales of $39.78 million surpassed expectations to the tune of $2.28 million. More significantly, Telenav's Q2 FY2015 revenue grew 8% year-on-year (yoy) and 14% quarter-on-quarter (qoq), making it the first time in the trailing six quarters that it has managed to register top-line growth on both a yoy and qoq basis. This is the strongest validation of the progress that Telenav has made since it diversified its revenue base from its legacy Scout navigation business into location-based mobile advertising and personalized navigation for embedded/connected cars.In my original article, I mentioned that new contract wins will be a catalyst for the re-rating of Telenav's stock price. Telenav did not disappoint in this respect, having announced a new contract win from Ford (NYSE:F) in January 2015. In addition, it also revealed the identity of the top five global automotive OEM, which it announced in January last year that it will partner with to provide embedded and connected navigation services globally starting in fiscal 2017, to be General Motors (NYSE:GM). Another catalyst I wrote about was the increase in Telenav's client base of local and national advertisers for its mobile advertising business, and Telenav has delivered on that as well.ImpactTelenav was named as the navigation systems vendor for Ford's next generation SYNC3 infotainment system in January 2015. This further validates Telenav's strong relationship with Ford. Telenav's first automotive navigation product was introduced for Ford's 2010 model year vehicles in fiscal 2008, and its on-board GPS navigation software is currently used on 16 Ford models in North America as of the end of fiscal 2014. Notwithstanding, there still exists ample opportunities for future growth with Ford. For example, Telenav's products are launched on only two Ford models in Europe, and CFO Mike Strambi mentioned at the recent earnings call that he expects that Telenav's automotive navigation systems will 'over time and potentially later in the year to be included on a few more models.'Also, as a prelude to its global collaboration with General Motors with respect to the provision of embedded and connected navigation services in 2017, Telenav's mapping and one-box search platform will be part of the new version of General Motors' OnStar RemoteLink mobile application unveiled in January 2015. With both General Motors and Ford on board for its automotive navigation systems, Telenav is well-positioned to secure more large OEMs as clients in the near future.With respect to Telenav's mobile advertising business, it mentioned that it had expanded its client base to include a 'broader range of traditionally large advertisers including auto, entertainment, and an increased variety of retail clients.' More significantly, Telenav is building stronger and more profitable relationships with its existing mobile advertising clients. It highlighted that it has witnessed the increase in major contracts signed with dollar amounts exceeding $50,000 and also the duration of these engagements in Q2 FY2015.ActionThe investment thesis for Telenav is playing out well, as per the points I have highlighted in my original article. In Q2 FY2015, the high growth businesses of automotive and mobile advertising accounted for more than 70% of its revenue, suggesting that Telenav is on track to meet its target of these two businesses contributing close to three-quarters of revenue for full-year fiscal 2015.When I published my original article, Telenav was trading at $6.63, as of December 18, 2014. The share price of Telenav went as high as $7.29 on January 13, 2015, but closed at $6.57 as of February 2, 2015. I stand by my original target price of $10.51, derived by applying a 1-year forward EV/Revenue multiple of 1.8 times to its forecasted fiscal 2015 revenue of $160 million and adding net cash. The target price implies an upside of approximately 60%."

These high growth business are expected to account for close to three-quarters of revenue in fiscal 2015, compared with 14% in 2012. Automotive OEMs' exploration of new revenue streams from connected services, advertising and mobile commerce and the large disparity between mobile media consumption time and mobile advertising spend are key growth drivers for Telenav's automotive and mobile advertising businesses respectively. Based on the average 1-year forward EV/Revenue multiple of its location technology peers, my target price of $10.51 implies 58% upside for Telenav.Company DescriptionTelenav is one of the pioneers in personalized navigation for mobile devices; it diversified into location-based mobile advertising and personalized navigation for embedded/connected cars in the past two years, following competitive threats from smartphones and free apps to its legacy Scout navigation product. Telenav's automotive and mobile advertising businesses accounted for 61% of its fiscal 2014 (year ended June) revenue, compared with 14% in fiscal 2012.AutomotiveTelenav's automotive business offers its clients, auto manufacturers and OEMs, a complete in-built automotive navigation system comprising software and related map and navigation platform services and content within the car, with embedded modem integration available to provide connectivity for real-time data services like traffic. This is a large and growing market, with global embedded navigation shipments to grow by a CAGR of 16.7% from 19.5 million in 2012 to 67 million in 2020, based on research published by Strategy Analytics in July 2013. Both consumers and automotive OEMs are driving the demand for Telenav's navigation solutions, as the rise of smartphones have led consumers to embrace navigation as a must-have service, while OEMs see the potential of new revenue streams with respect to connected services, advertising and mobile commerce.Telenav's automotive business has grown in line with increased demand for in-built automotive navigation systems, with segmental revenue rising from $28 million in fiscal 2012 to $75 million in 2014. Telenav first entered the automotive navigation space in fiscal 2008 with Ford (NYSE:F), with its first navigation product launched in Ford's 2010 model year vehicles. Telenav's on-board GPS navigation software is currently used in Ford's vehicles (16 models in North America as of fiscal 2014) equipped with MyFord Touch and MyLincoln Touch, in-car communications and entertainment systems developed by Ford. Ford also launched such vehicle models equipped with Telenav's navigation software in South America and China in fiscal 2012 and 2013 respectively. Telenav's white label versions of its automotive navigation platform was integrated into Delphi (NYSE:DLPH) connected infotainment system, which was launched in three of General Motors' (NYSE:GM) year 2013 models for North America. In January 2014, Telenav announced that it has signed partnership with another large top five global automotive OEM to provide worldwide embedded and connected navigation services beginning with select model year 2017 vehicles. Going forward, Telenav expects to launch its navigation products in China with a major Chinese Auto OEM through Delphi in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, while Ford will also be launching vehicle models equipped with Telenav's navigation software in Europe, Australia and New Zealand in this current fiscal year.Looking ahead, Telenav is guiding for automotive revenue to expand from $75 million in fiscal 2014 to between $96 million and $102 million in 2015, representing a year-on-year growth rate of approximately 28%-36%. This forecasted growth is higher than the global embedded navigation shipments CAGR of 16.7% between 2012 and 2020, but I think that this is highly achievable, given Telenav's competitive advantages. Telenav's track record gives it an edge over competitors and new entrants; it has 15 years of connected navigation and five years of automotive navigation solutions experience. This is also reflected in the industry's recognition of Telenav's products. Telenav's Scout personal navigator for cars was named as ""Best Navigation Solution"" at Telematics Detroit 2012, while Scout for Cars was among the finalists for the 2013 Automotive News Premier Automotive Suppliers' Contribution to Excellence Award in the Information Technology category. Another factor in Telenav's factor is that its navigation solutions boast global coverage in close to 100 countries worldwide, making it a preferred choice for automotive OEMs expanding globally to take advantage of growing automotive demand in developing markets. Telenav has also set up local development and product teams in North America, Europe and China to support its customers' global ambitions.Mobile AdvertisingTelenav's mobile advertising business offers an advertising delivery platform for advertisers to target consumers through its location targeting capabilities and manage mobile location data to optimize mobile campaigns for its clients. The opportunity for Telenav's mobile advertising solutions lies in the glaring gap between the time that users spend consuming media on mobile devices and the amount of money that advertisers spend on mobile advertising. Based on research by Kleiner Perkins in May 2014, 20% of media consumption time in the U.S. was devoted to mobile in 2013, but mobile advertising only accounted for a mere 4% of total advertising spend. Kleiner Perkins estimates that this is a $30 billion opportunity in the U.S. alone, if mobile advertising spend were to catch up with its share of media consumption time. Similarly, mobile advertising revenue only represented 32% of mobile monetization in 2013, with mobile app revenue accounting for the remaining 68%. This suggests that the potential of mobile advertising has not been fully exploited and monetized.Telenav grew its mobile advertising revenue three-fold from $4 million in fiscal 2013 to $12 million in 2014. It expects its mobile advertising revenue to further increase to a range of between $19.2 million and $23.1 million, equivalent to a year-on-year growth rate of 60%-93%. Telenav is likely to meet this target, as it is well-positioned to capitalize on the key issue constraining mobile advertising growth, accurate location data. In the absence of accurate location data, advertisers are not willingly to invest in audience-based targeting type of mobile advertising campaigns. Telenav acquired ThinkNear, a hyperlocal mobile ad company targeting consumers with precise and contextual location-based ads, in October 2012, to develop its expertise in advertising targeting capabilities. Since then, ThinkNear has grown to become a leading player in location-based mobile advertising, with its client base comprising hundreds of local advertisers and more than 70 national advertisers such as Pizza Hut and Olive Garden. ThinkNear's proprietary database of more than 100 million first-party unique location profiles and Telenav's location expertise derived from over a decade of serving location based services for tens of millions of mobile users suggest that competitors have an uphill challenge to compete effectively.Valuation And Potential CatalystsTelenav is currently valued by the market at 0.86 times trailing twelve months EV/Revenue, with net cash of $131.59 million accounting for approximately half of its market capitalization.I arrive at the target price of $10.51 for Telenav, by multiplying its fiscal 2015 revenue of $160 million by the average peer group 1-year forward EV/Revenue of 1.8 times and adding net cash of $131.59 million. The peer group of companies in the business of location-related technologies include Trimble Navigation (NASDAQ:TRMB), Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN), TomTom NV (OTCPK:TMOAF), Ituran Location & Control (NASDAQ: ITRN), TeleCommunication Systems (NASDAQ:TSYS), and LoJack (NASDAQ:LOJN). The target price of $10.51 represents an upside of 58%, based on Telenav's closing price of $6.63, as of December 18, 2014.Potential catalysts for the re-rating of Telenav's valuations to be closer in line with that of peers include new contract wins with automotive OEMs and an increase in its client base of local and national advertisers for its mobile advertising business.Variant ViewTelenav's investment risks relate to its insider trades, its negative profits and high level of customer concentration.Firstly, there has been net insider selling (no insider buying) of 32,224 shares in the past 12 months. Even when Telenav's share price declined to its 52-week low of $4.70 in August this year, insiders did not buy shares.Secondly, Telenav was loss-making in fiscal 2014, and that trend should continue into 2015, as it invests for future growth. If Telenav's plans don't materialize, it could take even longer for Telenav to restore itself to profitability.Thirdly, Telenav has significant customer concentrations risk, with Ford representing approximately 46% of its revenue in fiscal 2014. Ford and other OEMs will continue to account for an increasing portion of Telenav's revenue going forward, suggesting that Telenav's fate could be linked to the health of the automotive industry and the OEMs."
1634672,24921,2013-08-14T11:40:04-04:00,,"TeleNav (NASDAQ:TNAV) 8/13/13 Close $5.67ThesisTeleNav, Inc. specializes in vehicle navigation software. It has three main end markets - auto, feature phones, and smartphones. Its feature phones end market is contracting due to the introduction of free navigation through Google Map. Consequently, the fabulous growth in auto and smartphones end markets is obfuscated by the declining feature phones market. At current valuation, we believe TeleNav offers an attractive asymmetric risk/reward profile and it is likely to return to growth within the next few quarters.Catalysts· Auto and smartphones are rapidly becoming the main drivers of TeleNav's growth - as of last reported quarter, feature phones are roughly half of TeleNav's sales. The other half is comprised of auto and smartphones. This is up from 9% of the sales only 4 years ago. Sales from auto and smartphones have been growing at close to 40% annualized rate for the past three years. At this rate, TeleNav will return to top line revenue growth within the next 4 quarters.· TeleNav is a highly attractive acquisition target to acquirers such as Facebook, Yahoo, or a fixer-upper private equity fund - TeleNav's smartphone solution is very similar to one offered by Waze, which Google spent nearly $1 billion to acquire. To put this into prospective, TeleNav's market capitalization is only $225 million. Google could have spend a quarter of the money to acquire TeleNav's smartphone navigation solution and receive the rest of TeleNav's business for free. It gets better - TeleNav has close to $4.7 on its balance sheet. From an acquirer point of view, he/she is only paying $1 for the underlying business.· Share buyback - Over 80% of its market cap is comprised of cash, TeleNav has ample capacities to accretively buy back its shares. It has done exactly this - it bought back $26 mil in FY13 and $12.5 mil in FY12. Its share buybacks signal that the management is confident that TeleNav will return to profitability in the near future and the business itself can generate enough cash to fund its transition from a feature phone focused company into an auto/smartphone focused one.Risks· Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)/Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could enter the auto end market - including TeleNav, none of the navigation software companies has unique proprietary technology that will prevent others from entering the auto market. In this type of competitive situation, the market is large enough for multiple vendors to coexist. TeleNav has the incumbent advantage of being integrated into the Ford (NYSE:F) Sync.· Customer concentration - In its most recent quarter, Ford was 40% of TeleNav's revenue. Sprint (NYSE:S) and AT&T (NYSE:T) were another 38%. Its Sprint and AT&T revenues are expected to shrink over time because they are coming from feature phones. Its Ford relationship is instrumental to its transformation. Ford has signaled its commitment to TeleNav by spending $20 mil on integration TeleNav into its Sync in-dash console technology.ValuationIf TeleNav is successful with its transition, our financial projection suggests that TeleNav can return to its $0.80/share earnings power within the next two to three years. Adding back its cash and applying a conservative multiple of 10, TeleNav's share can be worth $13. On the flipside, if TeleNav's transformation plan falls apart, it is likely to worth at least its cash value or $4.7 because it can monetize its patent portfolios and use the proceeds to pay for the wind down cost.Quantitative Stock Selection MethodologyTeleNav first came to our attention when our Graham Dodd's Net Net Plus quantitative strategy signaled the stock for inclusion. Graham Dodd's Net Net Plus strategy looks for companies that are selling at close to liquidation value. It improves upon the classic buying at close to liquidation value strategy by avoiding companies with deteriorating operating trends and tell-tale signs of being a fraud.Income Growth Advisors offers a suite of quantitative strategies that seek to provide exceptional return profiles with less than market risk. We use empirically proven systematic investment strategies that take advantage various medium/long term market inefficiencies, and combine them with a rules based risk mitigation overlay. Examples of strategies include finding temporarily ignored companies with improving fundamentals, high quality companies that are selling at discounts to their intrinsic value, and inexpensive companies that are increasingly being recognized.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The chart below shows that the company lost ~60% of its total enterprise value:Source: YchartsThat's not all. In the last annual report, the company noted that both Ford and General Motors included Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto on some of their vehicles.

The most significant liabilities are accrued expenses and deferred revenue, $135 million. Investors should not worry about the company's amount of deferred revenue.

The company does not have debt, but it reports $99.47 million in cash and investments. With these figures, the enterprise value equals $174 million. With 2.5x sales, Telenav should have revenue of approximately $69 million.In 2019, the company reported revenue of $220 million, which means that the market is expecting a sale decline of more than 68%. In our opinion, the market pushed the share price too much down.In fiscal year 2019, General Motors was not even the source of 20% of Telenav's revenue. Let's assume that the company will lose 18% of its revenue. Thus, forward revenue of $180 million is reasonable. At 2x sales, Telenav will have an enterprise value of $360 million, which makes more sense than the current valuation of $170-$180 million.Given the relationship with GM and the total amount of revenue, Telenav's enterprise value declined too much. In our view, the total valuation will most likely be close to $360 million or more. Market analysts need to review Telenav again. Currently, it appears quite undervalued.Sale of new vehicles is subject to delay due to general economic conditions. If vehicle manufacturers plan to sell fewer cars or consumer demand declines, Telenav will most likely suffer a decline in revenue. As a result, the valuation of the company may decline. Market participants need to understand this risk well."
274745,24555,2011-06-14T08:01:29-04:00,,"A recent pullback saw the shares of TeleNav (NASDAQ:TNAV) correct around 20% from the 52 week high, starting early June 2011. On closer analysis, could this recent, much needed pullback - largely engineered by overall market sentiment in the broader market/indexes - offer a good buying opportunity for such progressive, cash rich companies as TNAV?In my research, I look for stocks with a minimum market capitalization of $50m, which are trading above 60% of their 52 week low, and present a strong fundamental bias to the upside. Looking at TNAV clinically, revealed some very interesting (and compelling) metrics.Firstly, a little info about the company: Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, TeleNav, Inc. primarily offers location based services for consumers and enterprises in the U.S. and internationally, providing GPS Navigator, a voice guided, real time mobile navigation service, which delivers live traffic alerts, route planning, and updated points of interest.The company offers GPS Navigator on a white label basis, such as Sprint (NYSE:S) navigation and AT&T (NYSE:T) navigator under the TeleNav brand. The company also provides enterprise-centric solutions such as mobile resource management solutions, which helps monitor and manage mobile workforces and assets by using its location based services platform to track job status and the location of workers, field assets, equipment, etc. The company also focuses increasingly on developing location based services for mobile phones, including location based mobile advertising, commerce, and social networking, a fast growth sector, requiring carefully managed products to develop niche advantages.Focusing on fundamental metrics, what I look for as a core measure, before shortlisting any stock as potential play, is the ""Free-Cash-Flow To Enterprise Value."" In the case of TNAV, this is presently (largely due to the pullback) a significant (I am tempted to say ""phenomenal"") 30.69%.This means that the cash-flow (true profit booked into the account - see next paragraph) is over 30% of the true value of the company. This is an enterprise where around $4.42 of its $14.43 stock price is ""pure cash flow"" generation.Note, the free cash flow (FCF) metric is a more accurate measure of a companies earnings, as it reflects the true operational performance (generation of actual cash profits) of a business. This eliminates any potential misrepresented accounting, or dubious non-operational entries into the profit/loss statements.The enterprise value (EV) metric is a more accurate representation of what a company is worth. Many investors simply take the market cap as a determination of a companies value. This is flawed, as it does not account for debt and cash the company may hold. A potential buyer would only pay the true worth of a business, which is the market capitalization PLUS debt (the acquirer would have to buy the debt), MINUS cash (the acquirer, once the company is purchased, also gains the cash reserves).Hence, unlike the commonly observed P/E ratio (which is based on the very basic, and questionable market cap and earnings metrics), the FCF/EV ratio more accurately represents the amount of true earnings a company produces as a ratio (or percentage) of the true worth of the business.In the case of TNAV, the current free-cash-flow generated is $119.37m, and the enterprise-value is $388.89m. Hence the FCF/EV ratio is 0.3069 (or 30.69%).Additional positive fundamental metrics in favor of TNAV include a price-to-earnings-growth ratio of 1.34, zero debts on the balance sheet, over $210m in cash (on balance sheet), year-on-year sales growth over the last five years.

4077339,81916,2017-05-31T09:36:17-04:00,"Telenav is a supplier of navigation software to various end markets.Historically their customer base has been mobile carriers, rather than auto OEMs.Their automotive business revenues (>70% over of current revenues) is set to hockey stick higher due to their ramping relationship with GM.While their main customer Ford is still growing, GM can surpass them within 2 years simply because they're larger than Ford.We see >100% upside in TNAV in the next 18 months.","SummaryTelenav (NASDAQ:TNAV) is a supplier of navigation software, primarily to automotive OEMs. The company has undergone a multi-year transformation from being exclusively a provider of navigation software to mobile operators (essentially all Sprint (NYSE:S) and AT&T (NYSE:T)) to one that is leveraged almost entirely to supplying a growing number of automotive customers, which began with their Ford (NYSE:F) relationship initiated back in 2008. Revenues from mobile carriers remained over 90% of revenues through FY11 (June FY) until Ford first became a 10% customer for TNAV in FY12. Today, with the Ford rolled out globally, automotive represents approximately 70% of revenues (and an even larger percentage of billings, which we will discuss further below). The growth in automotive is at an inflection point primarily due to the coming ramp of business with GM that should cause revenues to more than double over the next two years, in our estimation, and drive meaningful earnings and cash flows. Based on a modest multiple of 15x FY19 (June FY) earnings plus cash, we see the stock being worth roughly double where it trades now over the next 12-24 months.Investment opportunitySimply put, TNAV is particularly attractive now because the automotive business is set to more than double over the next 2 years which is a huge growth inflection that will drive the company from loss-making (over the last few years) to profitability (or at least FCF+) soon (in FY18 based on our estimates which begins July 1, 2017)Business SegmentsWe would be remiss if we did not point that the company does report in 3 business segments, though our focus is primarily on Automotive Navigation. The segments can be seen in the model above. The automotive segment is where we see the most material ramp over the next 2 years, as can be seen in our model.Given our focus on the auto segment, we should discuss Ford initially. To start out, Ford represents at least $150M (can be seen in both annual & quarterly filings) in annual revenues for TNAV currently. Given that GM was approximately 50% larger in terms of unit shipment volume worldwide in CY16, we use that as a starting point in estimating the potential for GM relative to Ford for TNAV. Given that the solution TNAV is providing to GM is embedded (AND connected - i.e. maps updates, search, etc), we assume that GM can be ~50% larger than Ford in terms of automotive units over time (based on 2016 industry shipment volumes) and a slight (10%) ASP premium with GM vs. Ford given that it is a connected, higher value-add solution being provided.Revenue vs. BillingsOne issue that has somewhat obscured the ramp in the automotive business recently (and actually caused a decline in reported revenues, despite their automotive business actually ramping strongly) are the nuances that sometimes automotive arrangements require deferral of revenue (and costs) over an extended period of time, sometimes as long as 10 years (~3 years is more typical). This is despite TNAV getting paid by their auto OEM customers upfront and TNAV paying out their vendors (primarily map providers) as well. When the embedded solution with Ford was rolled out, there was no need to defer revenues and all revenue was recognized upfront as TNAV's solution was installed in a new vehicle as an embedded solution. But now, various arrangements (including Toyota (NYSE:TM), Ford in certain geographies, and now the embedded/connected solution being provided to GM) that exist require revenue/cost deferral due to an ongoing service commitment, i.e. the TNAV is required to allow the vehicle to connect to their data centers for updates, etc., under the auto OEMs agreement with the car buyer. Again, this does not change the timing of cash flows or the profitability of these arrangements, but it does have a significant impact on the income statement as can be seen in the growing divergence between Revenue and Billings in the model above. This divergence may improve slightly going forward.Management has communicated recently that they expect to adopt a new FASB accounting standard under GAAP that will allow them to substantially recognize all of these arrangements as revenues immediately, rather than deferring as they do now. From the Q2FY17 call:The ""aforementioned non-GAAP measures"" are billings, GM on billings, and adjusted EBITDA on billings. We assume in our model in FY18 all automotive revenue is recognized upfront as revenue and none is deferred; we still do not have clarity on this, based on our most recent conversations with the CFO, however, we still think this accurately reflects cash flows, thus we're calling it revenue/EPS in the model shown until we have guidance otherwise. Essentially, if our numbers above are not revenues/EPS, they'll simply be Billings/FCF (or, neither if we're wrong!) Latest discussion from CFO on this issue is here.Risks- The key is likely whether TNAV can actually double revenues over the next 2 years and generate commensurate cash flow. I think I've laid out their strong relationship with GM (in units of roughly 1.5x larger than Ford units) which should ramp relatively quickly at a higher ASP than Ford (I don't know how much of the connected premium will mean, so I conservatively assume a modest 10% premium, but I see no reason it couldn't actually be 2x; management can't disclose unless they wish to violate confidentiality and lose one of their two most important customers so we'll have to wait and see).- GM does not ramp as expected. While the company has been working with GM for over three years now, the initial vehicle models (some Cadillacs on half model year roll-outs, i.e. in between model year '17 and model year '18) with TNAV's embedded/connected solution are currently rolling out already per the company's Q3 call.The company also announced an extension (from 2020->2025) and expansion of their current GM deal in conjunction with their earnings release. TNAV has already gone through a soup to nuts rollout with Ford which began in earnest in 2011, so this is not new territory for them. Auto OEMs do not take multi-year planning lightly and the facts that 1) TNAV has now started rolling out (initial half-model year Cadillacs), 2) the 2020-2025 extension just announced 3) GM is committed to a higher ASP solution (embedded/connected vs. just embedded with Ford), and 4) GM unit shipments were ~50% higher worldwide than Ford's in CY16 all seem to indicate that not only is GM committed but that the GM rollout will be larger than TNAV's current rollout with Ford.- Ford agreement expires at the end of CY17. There is always the potential that Ford does not renew the arrangement. We view this as unlikely given that Ford fairly recently launched their SYNC 3 platform (in many geographies) with TNAV included over the last 12-18 months. TNAV first had their embedded navigation solution installed in Ford's SYNC 2 platform when it was rolled out beginning in model year 2012. With TNAV designed into the SYNC 3 platform, we view it as unlikely that they will lose this business until the rollout of a new platform (SYNC 4?) from Ford. Given the roughly 4-5 year cycle for SYNC platform changes Ford has demonstrated thus far (the original SYNC launched in 2007), we don't expect to see a new platform (with potentially different software providers) until the 2020-2021 timeframe. It's also worth noting that TNAV called out that TNAV embedded navigation take-rates on SYNC 3 with Ford had been materially climbing recently versus their prior versions. Hardly a sign of trouble with the Ford relationship.- Competition from Apple's CarPlay and Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android Auto. Ford has opened its SYNC 3 platform to these options, which could reduce demand for the embedded solution from TNAV. While the risk here is hard to gauge and not to be discounted, we'd note 1) that free mobile navigation solutions from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google have long been available (nearly a decade) without meaningfully impacting the take rates of embedded in-dash navigation, and 2) Auto OEMs view this as a huge upsell/competitive opportunity (i.e. why just give an easy connection to AAPL/GOOG when they can potentially upsell a sleeker, embedded in-dash recurring revenue solution of their own?).ValuationWe base our 12-24 month price target on a multiple of 15x our FY19 fully taxed EPS estimate of $0.89 plus FY19 ending net cash per share of $3.73 to arrive at a target of $17.14, representing 109% potential upside.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

A fortress like balance sheet and high EBITDA (albeit declining) limit downside risk while strong growth in new businesses and the possibility of a buyout provide significant upside potential.Company overviewTNAV provides location based services (LBS) through mobile phones, tablets, computers, cars and apps and generates revenue from wireless carriers, automobile manufacturers, app developers and advertisers. TNAV completed its IPO in May 2010.Investment thesisThe current valuation implies little value for the declining core wireless carrier subscription business and growing auto OEM, premium LBS and mobile advertising businesses as net cash (no debt) accounts for 92% of the market cap.Multiple stock repurchase programsDuring the nine months ended 3/31/13 it repurchased $24.2 million of stock at an average price of $7.32. During FY12 repurchased $12.5 million of stock at an average price of $8.44. During FY11 repurchased $12 million of stock at an average price of $10.36. Announced $10 million repurchase program in March 2013 (as of 3/31/13 no repurchases made). The net benefit is offset given that past purchases were made at much higher levels.NOL tax loss carryforwardsFederal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $3 million and $9.7 million, respectively. Federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards of $384,000 and $265,000, respectively.Success in transitioning into new businessesAuto, advertising and premium LBS revenue is growing at 100% and rose from virtually nothing three years ago to 58% in the mrq. TNAV sold its enterprise business unit to FleetCor Technologies this year for $10 million to focus on these consumer facing businesses.Source: Company presentationSource: Company presentationAuto businessTNAV partners with Ford and Delphi (for GM vehicles) to provide in-car navigation. TNAV is in 15 Ford and Lincoln models in North America (vs four a year ago), three models in General Motors and expanding into South America, China, Europe and Australia. The longer sales cycle related to auto OEMs is offset by long term supply arrangements for multiple models across multiple regions.TNAV previously expected revenue from the auto business to double y-y to over $15 million in FY13 however it achieved this goal early and now expects revenue to exceed $65 million in FY13.Global Navigation MarketSource: Company presentationMobile advertisingTNAV is a leader in the hyperlocal ad market (with acquisition of ThinkNear) with 10+ years in location services experience. TNAV offers a scalable platform that delivers better targeting with location and situational context, which can benefit from the trend towards measurable ROI based advertising.Additional competitive advantages include:Source: Company presentationSale to strategic or financial buyerThe quickest way to narrow the valuation discount is to sell to a strategic or financial buyer. The recent trend of mature tech companies spending billions of dollars on money losing startups in order to plug product gaps continues with the recent $1.1 billion acquisition of Waze by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). GOOG is not averse to spending billions on companies with no profits (bought YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006) and receives an intangible (though no less valuable) benefit of keeping Waze out of the hands of one of its largest rivals. This follows the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr by Yahoo (YHOO) in May of this year.The CEO did not rule out selling at the recent JPMorgan tech conference. He said ""that can be one option"" (meaning sell) when asked about the interest in Waze although he prefers to remain independent.Scout by TNAV (voice-guided, real time, turn by turn, GPS) is similar to Waze in popularity (#3 most popular app in iOS app store navigation category behind Waze at #2) and features. The TNAV platform is flexible (works on all major mobile phone operating systems and broad range of wireless network protocols) and scalable. TNAV also holds 11 U.S. patents and 29 foreign patents and has 115 U.S. and 67 foreign patent applications pending.TNAV expects to generate $186-188 million in revenue in FY13, non-GAAP net income of $17-18 million, adjusted EBITDA of $23-24 million yet its operating businesses are valued at $16 million (based on EV). Waze only generated ~$1 million in revenue last year (though expected to grow rapidly), no profits and sold for $1.1 billion.A strategic buyer with more financial resources could better afford the significant development costs in building an extensive location based services offering. The following are potential strategic buyers who could easily afford to pay even a 50% premium:Facebook (FB): FB is the most likely buyer given the growing importance of location based services to its core product offering and their interest in Waze.Microsoft (MSFT): MSFT similarly needs a competitive location based services offering given low Windows phone market share. Furthermore, MSFT has shown the willingness to spend significant amounts of money to develop a core product offering (XBox) despite some analyst objections.Apple (AAPL): AAPL needs to improve their location based services offering more than most of its competitors given the previous troubles as a result of switching from GOOG maps. Their numerous acquisitions within the past year show its willingness to buy vs. build.FB, AAPL or MSFT could easily spend multiples of $16 million (TNAV EV) and years of their time developing their own location base services offering internally. The low EV allows an all cash purchase and eliminates the need to issue shares or debt.Although a sale to a strategic buyer is the more likely scenario, a sale to a financial buyer is possible given the substantial cash balance (92% of market cap), no debt and high (albeit declining) EBITDA. A financial buyer could place the wireless carrier subscription business into run-off, eliminate all non-essential personnel/capex and focus solely on auto, premium LBS and mobile advertising.Similar to a strategic buyer, a financial buyer could pay in cash due to the low EV. While this would obviously lower returns (compared to financing part of purchase with debt), it would also significantly reduce risk (given the declining EBITDA) and still provide an attractive return on a risk-adjusted basis. The source of many failed buyouts can be attributed to debt - either debt of the target company and/or debt used to be financed the buyout. In this case there would be none.Why sell now?Significant insider selling over the past year reduced its stake from 51.1% in October 2012 to 37.3% as of 3/31/13 and leaves TNAV vulnerable to an activist investor/LBO/strategic acquirer. Furthermore, the top 10 institutional holders own ~16% of the stock and should be willing to discuss any opportunity to maximize shareholder value given the 36% decline YTD.RisksIncreased spending going forward. Expected increase in spending to expand into auto, premium LBS and mobile advertising businesses.Customer concentration. Sprint, AT&T and Ford account for 15%, 23% and 46% of revenue in the mrq, respectively.Decline in core wireless carrier subscription business. The decrease in wireless carrier subscription revenue is greater than the increase in auto OEM and mobile advertising revenue. Carrier revenue will decrease due to the elimination of Sprint agreement in September 2013 and lower number of paying subscribers (AT&T and T-Mobile) as more end users use free navigation services. TNAV will continue to partner with Sprint through 2015 by sharing revenue from advertising and premium upsell as well as preloading product on their devices.Competition from free/premium alternatives. Major competitors include Google, Apple, Nokia, Microsoft, TomTom, Garmin, Bosch, TeleCommunication Systems, Nav N Go, Intel (through acquisition of Telmap). Also competes against vehicle installed GPS systems.Stock near critical $5 level. Analyst coverage may decrease if price falls below $5, stock will no longer be marginable and institutional investors may be restricted from buying. However, long term investors may be able to invest at an attractive price due to forced selling if this occurs.ConclusionThe target price is based on a conservative 4x EV/EBITDA multiple (less than half peer group average multiple) given the declining core business and reduced outlook.A tight stop can be placed below the narrow trading range since the beginning of May 2013.The time frame is 12-24 months with the back end dependent on TNAV remaining independent.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2354265,52082,2014-07-29T16:14:21-04:00,"Telenav has declining profit margins and revenue in the double digits YoY.There were no insider purchases in the last six months, but there has been 250,185 in sales.Currently, Telenav has negative price momentum and has declined 17% in the last year.Telenav has little or no potential upside because their value proposition is constantly being eroded by newer technology.","Telenav (NASDAQ:TNAV) provides mobile navigation services, competing with Apple and Google Maps. Currently, they have two real end markets, which include mobile systems, and autos. Sprint, AT&T, and Ford make up approximately 78% of their total revenue as of their last quarter. Alternative solutions and competition in the mobile navigation industry will continue to grow, which spells out trouble for this unprofitable business.On the surface, it may seem as if Telenav is confident in its future because they have bought back $10m worth of shares in the last 12 months. This represents 20% of the shares outstanding; however, in six months, no insiders have purchased shares of the company and there were 21 sales, totaling 250,185 shares. Buying back shares while insiders sell off their holdings seems dubious, and exactly how management might react if they also believed their fundamental business model was flawed. This strategy basically allows insiders to transfer money from the cash on the balance sheet to their own pockets, albeit indirectly and more discretely.Valuation and GrowthAs of Telenav's last quarter, their trailing 12-month EPS was -$0.16. In addition to reporting an earnings loss, Telenav's revenue is declining. Analyst estimates for FY 2015 have Telenav's revenues declining about 6.5%. With negative levered free cash flow of around 16.76m, there is no reason to expect that the business as it currently exists has any value besides what it holds in cash and the liquidation value of its assets. Here Telenav actually shines. As of the most recent quarter, Telenav is trading at 0.96 price/book (P/B) ratio and holds approximately 73% of its stock price in cash as of the close on July 28, 2014.However, given its current trajectory, the company will continue to burn through the cash on the balance sheet in order to try and save a lost business model. Without new growth opportunities, there is no way the company can save its income statement. Telenav has very concentrated revenue streams, which means losing just one client would be detrimental to the business. It is possible for Telenav to lose its current clients in two ways: if a company decides to build out its own navigation system, as Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) did, or to a competitor with widely used software, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).The most disappointing trend in Telenav's business is the decline in its profit margins. On the most recent earnings call, Telenav's CEO stressed that they are implementing cost-cutting strategies. However, the effects of these strategies seem to have little impact on results, as can be seen in the chart below.TNAV Profit Margin (TTM data by YCharts)RisksThere are two major risks to initiating a short position on Telenav. First, if the company can get its growth back by expanding its value proposition to clients, or provide a new service/product to the marketplace Telenav may be able to turn its sinking ship around. This seems highly unlikely given their competitors are the largest and most innovative technology companies on the planet. The company also does not seem to have any major ideas in the pipeline.The second risk is that Telenav is able to strengthen its operating efficiency and deliver profit to its investors. This would mean the company would no longer need to burn through its cash and its business would have some intrinsic value. However, the market is currently rewarding growth companies, and a small but stable earnings picture will not be enough to outperform the market indices. Also, consider this note in the risk factors section taken directly from the 10-Q filing with the SEC:Even in a bullish scenario for Telenav, it is unlikely they will get both profitability and growth. It will be one or the other.ConclusionTelenav is a declining business with an obsolete product that will continue to fall until it stabilizes itself on its balance sheet or cash. If management makes clear that they are willing to spend their cash to invest in their declining business, then further downside from what the company currently holds in cash could be expected. This is currently $3.73, representing a 27.15% decline. So long as Telenav remains below its 50-day moving average it can be shorted with favorable expected risk to reward. Also, keep an eye on their earnings reports for any improvement in operating efficiency or acceleration in revenue.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in TNAV over the next 72 hours.

With the NASDAQ experiencing its largest intraday gain in over a year on Monday in response to news of the European Union's $1 trillion bailout package, increased risk appetite could bode well for this week's crop of deals. Two deals likely to generate interest among IPO investors are Express (NYSE:EXPR), the sixth largest specialty retailer in the US, and TeleNav Holdings (NASDAQ:TNAV), a leading provider of mobile navigation services. Though Express is the larger of the two companies, TeleNav has a more aggressive growth outlook and could be well-positioned to ride the wave of successful tech IPOs that took place in March.The TermsTeleNav plans to raise $84 million by offering 7 million shares at a range of $11-$13. At an IPO price of $12 per share, TeleNav will command a market capitalization of $541 million and an enterprise value of $437 million. The Sunnvale, CA-based software firm plans to list on the NASDAQ under the symbol TNAV. J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank Securities are the lead underwriters on the deal.Business OverviewFounded in 1999, TeleNav Holdings provides location based services (LBS) for mobile devices, including the carrier-branded applications offered by Sprint (NYSE:S) and AT&T (NYSE:T). Its scalable web-based platform supports more than 500 types of phones and the company has rapidly built an installed base of 14.5 million current users with 15 different carriers in 29 countries. These carriers, which bill users either on a bundled or stand-alone basis, pay TeleNav monthly fees, providing the company with recurring revenues and strong cash flows. The increase in end users has continued to drive impressive financials with a 59% year-over-year jump in revenue to $122 million for the nine months ended March 2010, which was partially offset by the decline in monthly ARPU due to more bundled (vs. stand alone) packages and fee negotiations by carriers.Going forward, TeleNav hopes to further penetrate the large and growing US mobile navigation market (estimated $2 billion by 2012) and grow its current 20-25% share, as well as make a move into the emerging mobile advertising market.CompetitionThe biggest threat to this company is competition, both from those who offer navigation services for free, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK), as well as personal navigation device providers, such as Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) and TomTom (OTCPK:TMOAF). In the past, TeleNav has relied heavily on its relationships with Sprint  (55% of sales) and AT&T  (34%), which could lose exclusivity this December and next March, respectively, making it even more difficult for the developer to navigate its tough competitive landscape. These concerns have adversely impacted the performance of TeleNav's peers, causing them to underperform the broader market over the past month; its closest comparable, TeleCommuncation Systems (TSYS), which supports Verizon's ""VZ Navigator"" application, is down over 50% year-to-date.Furthermore, TeleNav's planned foray into the fast-growing $416 million US mobile advertising market will also be squeezed by larger and more diversified companies such as Apple, which is planning to launch a new advertising network dubbed iAd later this year, and Google, which recently acquired the world's leading mobile advertising company, AdMob, for $750 million.The OutlookOverall, TeleNav is a company with a track record of growth and profitability, and its scalable, web-based platform is only used by 10% of its wireless carrier partners' combined subscriber base, giving it ample opportunity for further penetration. Additionally, these carrier relationships provide TeleNav with the ability to leverage their marketing and distribution networks at low cost. However, looming obstacles will force investors to make a halftime decision and choose between TeleNav's solid past performance and risky future prospects when the company comes to market this Thursday, May 13th."

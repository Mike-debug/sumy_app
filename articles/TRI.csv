Its share repurchasing program even more so.Have investors, and the market, properly assessed the company in light of the deal and the company's expected transformation?","Thomson Reuters (NYSE: TRI) (TSX: TRI) and Blackstone (NYSE: BX) will be finalizing their long-awaited deal, the sale of a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters's Financial & Risk Business, on October 1st. Concurrently, Thomson Reuters will be buying back $10 billion in shares, equivalent to around a third of the company's total number of shares outstanding. As the deal will significantly alter the company's financials, growth prospects, balance sheet and market cap, I thought it might be of interest to take a close look at Thomson Reuters and the Blackstone deal. In this article I'll value the company, calculate how accretive the deal was to shareholders, and discuss the planned share buyback program. I believe the company is looking slightly undervalued, mostly due to its stable revenues and overall business model.Note: All figures in USD. First, a quick summary of the Blackstone deal. Thomson Reuters will sell 55% of its Financial and Risk Business unit to Blackstone for $17 billion. The stake accounts for close to a third of the company's EBITDA. Most of the proceeds will be used to finance a share repurchasing program, for close to a third of the company's market cap / shares outstanding. Proceeds from the deal will be used as follows:(Source: Thomson Reuters 2Q2018 Investor Presentation)Read more about the deal here.Aswath Damodaran likes to begin his valuations with a story, to better ground the subsequent financial analysis. I think it is a very useful habit so I've come to do the same.Thomson Reuters's narrative is, I believe, quite straightforward. The company operates in a mature industry with few competitors. Its business model and revenue/cash-flow generation are both incredibly stable, due to its subscription-based business model and many markets of operation.(Source: Thomson Reuters 2017 Annual Report)Being the market leader in a mature industry has its downsides, however. Thomson Reuters's has had very anemic growth for the past few years, with the company focusing on margin improvements through economies of scale:(Source: Thomson Reuters Blackstone Deal Presentation)The Blackstone deal will, however, change things for the better. First, Thomson Reuters will receive $1-$3 billion for investments in their core business segments, so revenue growth will likely increase. Second, the company will likely also see quite a bit more growth in their Financial and Risk business unit. Blackstone, as one of the largest private equity investment firms in the world, has the capacity, experience and willingness to turnaround struggling companies/operations. By retaining a 45% stake in the partnership, Thomson Reuters is sure to benefit from the above. Third, Thomson Reuters will be retiring a significant portion of their shares, close to a third, so shareholders should see some accretion.To summarize, Thomson Reuters's valuation is dependent on the company's stable revenues and business model, its anemic revenue growth, and expected benefits from the Blackstone deal.With the story or narrative in place, I can calculate the company's valuation. I'll be using a DCF model, but first I'm going to state my assumptions. Figures and growth rates were almost all based on company guidance, which has generally been met, and previous performance. The only exception was EBITDA growth for the company's Financial and Risk business segment. I estimated 5% growth due to benefits from the Blackstone deal. Mid-single digit growth is about the best performance a company in a mature industry can expect.With the assumptions in place I'll forecast the company's operating results and free cash flow. I included data for 2017 and 2018 for comparison purposes and consolidated the company's portion of the Financial and Risk business segment along with the others.With the forecast in place I can calculate the company's valuation using a DCF model.The risk-free rate and equity risk premium are standard numbers and the beta used was the company's 5-year average.The terminal growth rate of 2.5%, for years after 2023, is slightly higher than the company's 2% recent average, as I assumed the Blackstone deal would also bring long-term benefits.For shares outstanding, I assumed $10 billion in share buybacks, as per company announcements, at an average price of $44.5, close to its current trading price.Thomson Reuters will also be receiving around $4-$5 billion in extra proceeds from the Blackstone deal. I've included $2.4 billion of these, corresponding to an investment fund and certain extra costs related to the transaction.Based on the above, the company's valuation is as follows:Based on the calculations above, Thomson Reuters is currently 15% undervalued. Consistent with the narrative, the company's undervaluation is mostly driven by the company's stable business model and benefits from the Blackstone deal.The first is responsible for the company's relatively low beta of 0.68 and cost of equity of 6.8%. The very low cost of equity for the company ensures its cash-flows trade at a relative premium versus the broader market, as they are much less volatile and risky. If the company's beta was closer to the market average of 1 the company would be significantly overvalued:The Blackstone deal is also driving the valuation in two key ways. First, the $2.4 billion in extra proceeds, most of which will be invested or used for acquisitions, is a massive sum of money and directly accretive to shareholders. Once you account for the share buyback program that amounts to $5 dollars per share! The company's valuation would decrease to $46 dollars per share without these proceeds, very close to its current trading price of $45.5.Second, the Blackstone deal should drive higher EBITDA growth for Thomson Reuter's Financial and Risk business unit. By my estimations, if overall EBITDA growth was closer to the company's recent average of 2% the valuation would decrease to $45 dollars per share, equal to its current trading price.Exclude the three factors above and the company would be massively overvalued, which makes sense considering its anemic EBITDA growth for the past few years.It is also a bit surprising what isn't driving the relative undervaluation. Investors might think that the massive share buyback program, $10 billion for a company with a $31 billion market cap!, would significantly increase the company's value per share, but it more or less won't. By my calculations shares outstanding will go down by around 32% but the 55% stake in Financial and Risk was responsible for around 31% of the company's EBITDA, so the asset sale and share buyback program mostly cancel each other out.Notwithstanding the above, I decided to more directly compare the company's valuation with, and without, the share buyback program. A more thorough analysis shows the program itself was slightly accretive to shareholders:As you can see, the share buyback program is driving a $2 per share increase in valuation, equivalent to 5% of the company's valuation. Not huge, and probably less important than expected, but beneficial nonetheless.I wanted to take a closer look at the benefits of the Blackstone deal. To do this, I decided to re-do the valuation, this time assuming no Blackstone deal. Most of the assumptions, see above, change in straightforward ways: no share buyback program, no $2.4 billion in extra proceeds and forecasted EBITDA growth goes down to 2%. Forecasted operational results and valuation, including a side-by-side comparison, below:Consistent with my general thesis, it seems the deal was accretive to shareholders, the company would be trading at fair value without it. As mentioned previously, the change in EBITDA/terminal growth rate and the $2.4 billion in extra proceeds from the Blackstone deal are the key drivers in the above.Thomson Reuters is slightly undervalued according to my DCF model. I believe the Blackstone deal to be accretive and broadly beneficial to shareholders, as the company will gain a massive new investment fund and slightly increase its earnings growth. Nevertheless, the undervaluation is small and very dependent on the deal and Blackstone. Growth could fail to materialize, leveraged buyouts fail all the time, or volatility/the beta could spike, as Blackstone might pursue many changes in the business unit's strategy. I'm still cautiously optimistic about the company, but time will tell if the benefits from the Blackstone deal actually materialize.Finally, I want to take a look at the company's share buyback program. Around $1 billion will be repurchased following a normal course issuer bid, basically bought back from the public at market prices. The vast majority, $9 billion, will be repurchased through a modified Dutch auction:Basically, investors place bids to sell their shares for between $47-$42 dollars. The company then selects the cheapest $9 billion in tendered shares, and buys them at the highest price in the lot. If too many shares are tendered, offers are prorated. Investopedia has a very informative example if the explanations above didn't suffice.Even if shareholders don't tender enough shares the company seems commited to reducing its share count:As I'm valuing the company above the SIB range, $51 versus $47-$42, I can't really recommend participating in the SIB. Nevertheless, I recognize that investors and readers might disagree and wish to exit their positions. For these investors, I would recommend bypassing the SIB and just directly selling their shares in the open market, due to the low potential for returns and lack of a clear winning strategy.As the company is currently trading close to the upper-end of the SIB's purchase price range, there is very little potential benefit from participating in the SIB versus simply selling your shares. At most, investors could see 1%-3% higher returns. This seems, to me, to be too little to be worthwhile for investors.Although much has been written about Dutch auctions, there are very few foolproof ways to benefit from them, and even fewer worthwhile bidding strategies. From what I remember from my undergrad in economics and game theory classes, most forms of auctions are equivalent, and designed to (in this case) minimize costs for the issuer. Auction winners are, invariably, those who underestimate the company's valuation and future prize trajectory. Considering my valuation and DCF model I believe that to be the case this time as well.Thomson Reuters's deal with Blackstone seems likely to benefit the company and drive future earnings growth and investors returns. Thomson Reuters seems undervalued, but only slightly so and benefits from the deal could fail to materialize. Investors wishing to divest from the company should probably do so through an open market sale, as there is little potential for profit in the SIB.

Source: CrunchbaseHighQ operates in the legal and regulatory sectors of the global team collaboration software market.According to a market research report by Grand View Research, the global team collaboration software market was valued at nearly $8.2 billion in 2017 and is projected to reach $16.6 billion by 2025.This represents a forecasted CAGR of 9.5% between 2018 and 2025.The main drivers for this expected growth include an increasing need for digitization and visual data sharing as well as the rising demand for communication and conferencing solutions among enterprises due to rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.The cloud-based team collaboration software segment is expected to grow the fastest during the period due to the increasing need for flexible office spaces, and the ability to reduce infrastructure costs and use a centralized management system.Major vendors that provide horizontal team collaboration software solutions include:Source: SentieoTRI didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t provide a change in financial guidance, so it is likely the deal was for a financially non-material amount.A review of the firm’s most recent financial results indicates that as of March 31, 2019, TRI had $2.2 billion in cash and equivalents and $7.5 billion in total liabilities, of which $3.2 billion was long-term debt.Free cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was a negative ($168 million).In the past 12 months, TRI’s stock price has risen 45.9% vs. the broader overall U.S. market’s rise of 4.2%, as the chart below indicates:Source: Simply Wall StreetEarnings surprises have largely been positive over the past twelve quarters, with the exception of Q1 2018, as the chart shows below:Source: Seeking AlphaTRI acquired HighQ for its legal and regulatory collaboration system that connects law firms and their corporate clients.As TRI president and CEO Jim Smith stated in the deal announcement,TRI separates its operating segments into professional categories, so the new capability will be integrated into its Legal Professionals segment.By acquiring an existing collaboration solution, TRI reduces its time-to-market and development risk.And, by owning the increasingly important communication function, the system will enable TRI to build out additional capabilities that tie into it.While the deal is a small acquisition, I like the rationale and it points to TRI management’s thinking in the longer-term transition to digital interactions for its business segments."

I got triggered for writing an article about this stock because of my previous article on RELX (NYSE:RELX). In this article, I compared RELX to different competitors in the field of business analytics and research. In this article, I noticed that Thomson Reuters was trading at a P/E ratio of 10, compared to 22.8 from RELX. Hence, this article to see if Thomson Reuters is a worthy investment.Thomson Reuters is a mass media and information analytics company. It was formed in 2008 after Thomson Corporation bought the British Reuters company. The primary focus of the company is on legal, regulatory, and tax changes. Part of TRI is Reuters News, which is the world's largest multimedia news provider. In 2018, Reuters News delivered more than 2 million news stories.2018 was an important year for TRI. In October, it sold 55% of their Financial & Risk business to private equity funds for $17 billion. The other 45% of the new company named Refinitiv remains in possession of TRI. They restructured their remaining business into new customer-focused segments and repositioned the business for growth.In 2018, the revenue increased by 4% to 5,501 million USD compared to 5,297 million USD in 2017. The company has a strategy in place to become ""the premier global provider of the most trusted, must-have decision support tools and workflow solutions to professionals in information-intensive and highly regulated businesses"". To achieve this, they are going to focus on 5 areas (source: TRI annual report 2018):In 2018, they restructured the company into five new reporting segments. With this new structure in place, they hope that they can focus more on the demands of the customers and offer higher added value in the long term. The higher revenue will be achieved by this new operating model, and the focus is on more revenue through digital channels. Currently, 75% of their revenues come from recurring sources. Recurring revenues mostly come from subscription-based models which offer a more stable source of income.Source: TRI annual report 2018The outlook till 2020 is that revenue will increase by 7-8.5% in 2019 and in 2020 by 4% yearly.Source: TRI annual report 2018TRI now focuses on 5 customer segments, Legal Professionals, Corporates, Tax Professionals, Reuters News, and Global Print.Legal ProfessionalsLegal Professionals serves law firms and governments with research and workflow products. Legal Professionals accounts for 43% of the revenues of TRI Revenues for this segment increased by 3% YoY mainly due to recurring and transaction revenues. This segment also had the adjusted EBITDA increased, but the margin decreased due to the launch of a new product, Westlaw Edge.Primary competitor for this segment is LexisNexis, which is owned by RELX and Wolters Kluwer.CorporatesCorporates segment serves corporate customers, including the seven largest accounting firms. Corporates account for 23% of the revenues for TRI In 2018, revenues for this segment increased by 4% in total. In November 2018, they also acquired Integration Point. However, this acquisition did not yet have an impact on revenue growth in 2018.The competitors for this segment are Wolters Kluwer, LexisNexis and, MetricStream.Reuters NewsReuters News is probably the most well-known segment for most people. It provides real-time, multi-media news and information services to newspapers, television and cable networks, radio stations and websites around the globe, as well as to Refinitiv. In 2018, this segment saw revenue growth of 25%. However, this is mostly attributable to sales to Refinitiv. Organic revenues declined by 3% due to lesser demand from news agencies.The competitors for this segment include the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, Getty, and Bloomberg.Tax ProfessionalsThe Tax Professionals segment serves tax, accounting and audit professionals in accounting firms. The products and services offered help customers with research, optimizing workflows, and automating tax workflows.In 2018, revenues for this segment increased by 4%, mostly driven by revenues generated from accounting firms (5%) and in the global business by 14%.This biggest competitor for this segment is CCH owned by Wolters Kluwer. Another competitor is the Sage Group (OTC:SGGEF), for which I wrote an article earlier. This can be found here.Global PrintThe last segment is Global Print. This segment provides legal and tax information primarily in print format to customers around the world.In 2018, this segment experienced a 3% revenue decline as the globally more customers move to digital formats. This decline is expected to continue in the coming years, and TRI even gave a warning in their annual report:Global Print's primary global competitors are LexisNexis and Wolters Kluwer.In 2018, TRI changed its operating divisions into 5 segments. This was done to reposition TRI for growth. The new structure moves decision making closer to the customer, and it believed that it will increase customer satisfaction.This change is also part of their long-term strategy, which, as mentioned earlier, consists of the following 5 priorities:My take from this strategy is that the focus on digital products and simplifying the business will lead to a more efficient company. However, I do believe that the organic growth in the next couple of years will be lacking as they are restructuring the company, and they still have to develop more customer-focused products.TRI dividends increased with less than 1% during the last 5 years, and the current yield is around 2.44%. Based on these metrics, it is not a company I would consider buying for its dividend performance.Source: Self-made graph based on company data.They had diluted earnings per share of 5.81 USD. With a distribution of 1.385 USD per share, this results in a payout ratio of almost 24% last year. Resulting in a P/E ratio of around 10. However, this included a $3.4 billion gain on the sale of a 55% interest in the F&R business.Source: TRI annual report 20183,946 earnings less 3,400 from the sale for the F&R business leaves 546 million USD earnings. Divided by the diluted shares, it leaves an EPS of 0.817. Calculating with this number, we get the following result: A P/E ratio of 71 and a payout ratio of almost 170%.TRI operates in highly competitive markets and may be adversely affected by the competition. I believe that the strategic changes, and new customer segments will take some time before the full benefits will be shown and that these changes will leave space for competitors to acquire some market share.Besides this risk, TRI had other risks as well. 77% of the revenues come from the United States. A sudden market downturn or in governmental policies related to tax or legal areas might significantly impact TRI.One risk that is worth highlighting is the following:This risk clearly underlines the importance that the new strategy and customers segments will need to deliver on their promises.In my opinion, it will take some time before TRI can fully reap the benefits of the strategic turnaround. With a P/E ratio of 70 and lacking dividend growth, I think there are better investments that can be made in this industry, such as RELX. I will consider another look at TRI when the strategic turn around will start showing its promised deliverables."

In Q2, the company's earnings were in-line with its expectations and there's every reason to believe that its business will be able to create additional shareholder value in the next few months, as I see several catalysts that will drive growth. While COVID-19 will continue to have a minimal negative impact on the Thomson Reuters business, the company's strong balance sheet will help it to stay afloat. Considering this, I recently decided to add Thomson Reuters shares to my portfolio and plan to hold them for a considerable time.Thomson Reuters provides business information services through its analytics and data management platforms. After its reorganization in 2018, the company now operates in five different segments: legal, corporate, tax, news, and print. Thomson Reuters' major clients from the legal, corporate, and tax segments are law firms, governmental agencies, big corporations, accounting firms, and auditors, all of which use the company's platforms to communicate with each other and better manage the inflow of information in their respective industries. In addition, its Reuters news network is one of the biggest providers of news in the world. While in recent years, Thomson Reuters stock underperformed against the S&P 500, it now trades in-line with the rest of the market and has every chance to appreciate further in the following months.Chart: BloombergIn Q2, the company's total revenues were down 1% Y/Y to $1.41 billion, in-line with the Street expectations. At the same time, the company's organic recurring revenues, which account for 81% of the overall revenues, were up 3% Y/Y. The two segments that showed growth during the period were legal and corporate, which increased their revenues by 2% Y/Y and 4% Y/Y, respectively. The company's tax segment could've also shown growth, if it were not for the decision of the US Congress to extend the deadline for the annual tax filing from March 30 to July 15. According to the company, the lost revenue will be regained in Q3 and the tax segment will once again show growth.The two biggest underperformers that dragged the overall organic revenues down were the news and print segments. The news segment organic revenues in Q2 were down 11% Y/Y due to the company's inability to host in-person events as a result of a pandemic, while the print's organic revenues declined by 17% Y/Y due to the decline of demand for print news format as a result of the digitalization. Despite such a mixed performance, Thomson Reuters was able to minimize its downside, as its operating profit was $365 million, while its non-GAAP EPS was $0.44, above the Street expectations by $0.06.Source: Thomson ReutersGoing forward, there's every reason to believe that Thomson Reuters will continue to create additional shareholder value. Over the years, the company created powerful recurring revenue streams in three of its biggest segments and now they provide a stable inflow of cash even in the current turbulent environment. In addition, Thomson Reuters has been active on an M&A scene, acquiring various assets, which it believes will help the company to drive growth. In 2019, it purchased HighQ, a legal service collaboration platform, which connects law firms and lawyers with its clients. Considering that now there's an increased demand for legal collaboration tools, Thomson Reuters stands to benefit from this purchase in the long run.In the following months, Thomson Reuters will also be able to unlock value by selling its 45% stake in Refinitiv, which is a global provider of financial market data. Recently, it was announced that in an effort to please the EU antitrust watchdog, London Stock Exchange sold its stake in Milan's Borsa Italiana stock exchange to Euronext. As the sale is completed, the London Stock Exchange will receive a 'green light' from European regulators and will be able to close the $27 billion Refinitiv deal at the beginning of next year. Thomson Reuters stands to benefit from this deal, as its 45% stake in Refinitiv is worth $12.15 billion.As for risks, I see only a couple of them. First of all, COVID-19 will continue to have a minimal negative impact on the Thomson Reuters business, as the company will have problems holding its in-person events, which in the past contributed a small portion of revenues to the news segment. In addition, investors should expect the print revenues to decline even more in the upcoming quarters, as the demand for the company's print publications will continue to decline due to the rapid digitalization of news. Other than that, I don't see any major downsides to owning Thomson Reuters.The good news is that with $1.8 billion available under the credit facility and $946 million in cash reserves, Thomson Reuters is a solid company to own. While it has $3.7 billion in long-term debt, it has no debt maturities until 2023, which leaves the company's management enough time to create value and easily service its debt at the same time. In addition, Thomson Reuters is expected to boost its liquidity position in the following months, as the firm is currently exploring options to sell half of its shares in the Thomson Reuters Building, which is located on Times Square.Source: Thomson ReutersAlso, we should not forget that Thomson Reuters overall wasn't severely impacted by the pandemic, and as a result, it has no plans to cut its dividends. And while the company expects to experience minimal growth of its business this year, its long-term perspectives, which were described in this article, convinced me to justify acquiring its stock."

Although results were slightly above analyst expectations, the company reported significant cost increases, to the tune of $250-$350 million for 2018 and 2019, related to the Blackstone deal. Analysts were blindsided by the magnitude of the costs, and the expected decrease in income and EBITDA, causing the stock to tumble ≈4%.Although Thomson Reuters remains a solid company with a relatively low-risk business model and stable dividend, revenue growth has been anemic for the last few years. With costs rising for the next few years, and no indication that revenue growth will accelerate, its obvious income growth will be, at best, anemic in the medium-term.Note: I had previously given an overview of Thomson Reuters, click here to read it.Thomson Reuters has, until earlier this year, pursued a strategy of growing its business through acquisitions and mergers. This strategy proved successful in driving down costs, due to synergies and economies of scale in corporate headquarters costs, but was ineffective in driving organic sales/revenue growth.In January the company announced Blackstone would be acquiring a portion of its business. This deal, and its repercussions, has led to a change of strategy for the company. I thought(Source: Thomson Reuters 1Q2018 Earnings Call Transcript)Blackstone announced earlier in the year that it would be acquiring a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters' Financial and Risk business segment for around $20 billion (Read more: Blackstone bets big on Wall St. information business with Thomson Reuters deal). The company expects around half of the proceeds to be used to finance share repurchases, although details will remain scarce until the transaction closes.As Financial and Risk currently accounts for slightly over half the company's revenue, completing the deal will require significant legal, regulatory and operational work. The company has made solid progress in these fronts, and expects the deal to close in the second-half of 2018:(Source: Thomson Reuters 1Q2018 Earnings Call Transcript)As with many divestitures, the company will incur certain transition and stranded costs, mostly related to corporate headquarters expenditures, such as HR strategy functions or IT. Most analysts seemed to expect somewhere between $50-$100 million per year, but the company announced $150 million in stranded costs per year, plus $200-$300 million in investments for 2018/2019 to eliminate said stranded costs, figures significantly larger than expected. Increased costs will be responsible for reducing EBITDA by around 20% for 2018 compared to 2017, a significant reduction.(Source: Thomson Reuters 1Q2018 Earnings Call Transcript)Although the deal seems to be proceeding smoothly, the unexpected cost figures caused alarm in the market and led to the small dip after earnings. Seamless transition it was not, although at least the increased costs are only expected to be an issue for two years.As mentioned previously, Thomson Reuters has had very little organic sales/revenue growth during the last few years. Most key financial metrics have remained flat throughout the years, with revenue and EBITDA having a -2% and 2% 5-year CAGR, below-average results at best. The company needed a change of strategy to return to growth, and it believes the Blackstone deal is instrumental in that strategy. To quote from the earnings call:This partnership will very likely accelerate revenue and earnings growth in the near future for two key reasons. First, as Blackstone is uniquely well-positioned in the financial markets, the company will be able to leverage its network of relationships to ensure further sales in the Financial and Risk business segment. At the same time, Thomson Reuters will be using a portion of the proceeds ($1-$3 billion) for further investments in its smaller business segments (Tax, Accounting, Law and News).Although the deal has yet to close, the company has already seen some signs of increased growth this quarter. Thomson Reuters reported revenue and EBITDA YoY growth of 3%, margins remained flat. Although growth was anemic at best, it showed a marked improvement relative to the recent past, as the company's revenue has decreased 2% YoY for the last five years while its EBITDA has grown by less than 2%.(Source: Thomson Reuters 1Q2018 Earnings Call Transcript)Growth, small as it was, was generally evenly spread across customers and business segments, although Reuters News reported -3% revenue growth. Most revenue increases came from recurring subscription agreements and, as such, the company can expect to benefit from the increased revenue in the long-term.Management attributes this increase in growth to certain technological initiatives the company has started to implement, although most of these will start in earnest once the Blackstone deal is completed. Due to this, I can say that the company's strategy to reposition itself seems to be working so far/It is, of course, too early to tell if the company's shift in strategy will succeed in increasing the company's growth to mid-single digits. However, the fact that growth has picked up already, with the bulk of the planned investments yet to come, is likely indicative of the factThomson Reuters reported a mixed first quarter for the year. The significant increase in costs was unexpected, and responsible for the stock's poor performance after results were announced. The increase in revenue was, however, a pleasant surprise and very likely indicates the company's strategy pivot will prove successful. As the increased costs are likely to be eliminated in the coming years I believe the quarter was, on net, positive news for the company."

We usually speak about media streaming or telecoms when referencing content, but today's dividend champion spotlight goes off the beaten path.Thomson Reuters Corporation (TRI) has brought information content and solutions to the professional sector for years. This new dividend champion recently sold off a major stake in its core business that has transformed the company moving forward. A wide moat company in a steady industry, Thomson Reuters is a nice cash flow generator with years of dividend growth ahead.Thomson Reuters is a mass media and information company that brings information to professional sectors. These include corporate entities, tax professionals, government, and legal professionals. The company as it's currently known was formed in 2008, and is based in Toronto, Canada.Source: Thomson ReutersDue to the recent blockbuster deal that saw Thomson Reuters sell a 55% stake in its core Financial & Risk business to Blackstone (BX), the company will be adopting a new reporting structure in January 2019. The business will now report in five segments: Corporates, Legal Professionals, Tax Professionals, Reuters News, and Global Print. The company will generate more than $5 billion in annual revenues.Source: YChartsThe massive shakeup at Thomson Reuters will alter the format of our analysis from its usual blueprint. The past financial data is not very useful in forecasting the future performance of the ""new"" Thomson Reuters, but it does help explain why the shakeup happened. Revenues had eroded over a 10-year period. The industries and markets that Thomson Reuters services are steady (government, corporations, law practices), but that limits the growth upside of the business. This deal (which will have a full breakdown below) will (hopefully) enable Thomson Reuters to generate growth from a combination of actions.So before pressing on, what are the full terms of this major deal? In its most basic form, the deal revolves around Thomson Reuters selling a 55% stake in its core Financials & Risk business segment to Blackstone. The actual end result of the transaction is that the Financials & Risk business was spun off into a new corporation called ""Refinitiv,"" its own company that will generate about $6 billion in annual revenues. Blackstone owns 55% equity in the company, and Thomson Reuters owns the other 45%.In exchange for this, Thomson Reuters received about $17 billion in gross proceeds that are being used to pay down debt, buyback a boatload of shares, and a few billion to invest into growth ventures unrelated to this deal. Additionally, Thomson Reuters will receive $325 per year over 30 years in exchange for licensing Reuters News content to Refinitiv.Source: Thomson Reuters CorporationAs we move into the operational metrics of the company, investors should note that the format of the company has changed. The operational metrics still provide insight into what the core business performs like, but a true gauge on the ""new"" Thomson Reuters will take a couple of years to flesh out. The company is targeting various synergies and restructuring to boost margins and optimize the new structure of the company.Source: YChartsWith that said, we will begin by looking at the operating margins and conversion rate of revenue to free cash flow. It's important that a company is consistently profitable within its operating environment, so we look for margins that are consistent, or expanding. We also look for companies to produce a healthy stream of free cash flow, so we target a conversion rate of $0.10 FCF for every revenue dollar.Source: YChartsWe see that operating margins have been a bit volatile due to periods of increased CAPEX. Management is working on reducing CAPEX as a percentage of revenue, which should help stabilize and expand margins in the future. Meanwhile the company is a solid cash flow engine, consistently converting 10%-12% of its revenue into FCF.The next metric we will review is the cash rate of return on invested capital (CROCI). This is a great metric because it measures how effective management is at utilizing the company's resources from a cash generation basis. It also gives insight into how strong a company's competitive ""moat"" is. A company with a strong CROCI (percentage in the low-teens) is usually well managed, profitable, and not overly capital intensive.source: YchartsThomson Reuters' CROCI has consistently underperformed our benchmark. The silver lining in this, is that the CROCI has trended higher in recent years. Investors should monitor this metric in the years to come. If the company's deal with Blackstone is adding intrinsic value to the business, this metric should continue to rise in the years ahead.The last area of review before moving on is the balance sheet. It's important for companies to avoid over-borrowing. Taking on too much debt can cause vulnerability to rising interest rates, as well as a cash flow squeeze in the event of an unexpected downturn in the business.Source: YChartsThomson Reuters is currently carrying $507.00 million in cash against $7.08 billion in total debt. The current leverage of 2.37X EBITDA is just below my usual 2.5X ""warning sign"" threshold. Prior to the deal, leverage was above this mark, so the financials of the deal have certainly improved the fiscal standing of the company.Thomson Reuters is a brand new dividend champion with 25 years of consecutive raises. The dividend is paid to shareholders every quarter, and totals an annual payout of $1.40 per share. The dividend's current yield of 2.79% is just about inline with the 2.90% that investors can find 10-year US treasuries offering. This makes Thomson Reuters a solid option for investors with a preference towards income generation.Source: YChartsThe dividend has shown very little growth over the past 10 years, with a 10-year CAGR of 3.5%. This barely edges out historical inflation rates. Worse, the dividend has grown at a five-year CAGR of just 1.5%. The dividend doesn't face a funding crisis with a cash payout ratio of just 51%. A combination of balance sheet woes, slow revenue growth, and management priorities are to blame for the dividend moving so slowly. While this year's raise was just 1.4%, it remains to be seen if the long-term approach will change following the company's restructuring. Dividend growth investors will probably want to see growth before getting too excited.The restructuring of Thomson Reuters offers an opportunity for long-term growth. One of the things that Thomson Reuters must work through is a ""push and pull"" of revenue growth based on a business model that features both growing and shrinking components.Source: Thomson Reuters CorporationThe overall business is growing organically at 2% because the growing aspects of the company such as the tax and legal businesses are being dragged down by outdated businesses such as Global Print. As the growing businesses increase revenue contribution and management moves to further augment these segments (acquisitions), the dying print businesses will matter less to the top and bottom lines.Thomson Reuters is ""leaning"" up the company by shrinking a number of expense categories such as employees, offices, and CAPEX. This will boost margins in the years ahead.Source: Thomson Reuters CorporationThe company is also evolving from a content-focused company to a software-driven company. By providing more complete solutions that include cloud services, and other fleshed out offerings, Thomson Reuters hopes to expand its reach within the market to uncover opportunities.The current business is stable with a large percentage of revenues based on recurring subscriptions. However, there is execution risk in the company's move into new technologies. By getting into software solutions, the company is opened up to increased competition where it has previously operated with limited competition to its content offerings. In addition, the company must also continue to monitor its balance sheet. Even after the Blackstone deal, the company lacks space on the balance sheet. An overly ambitious acquisition in the name of growth could cause more problems than it solves.At just under $51 per share, Thomson Reuters stock currently trades near the top of its 52-week range. Analysts currently forecast Thomson Reuters to earn $2.48 for the full fiscal year. Based on the current price of shares, this results in an earnings multiple of 20.56X. This is a modest discount of 7% to the company's 10-year median multiple of 22.03X.To get a better handle on the valuation of the stock, we will look at free cash flow yield. There are a lot of moving parts within Thomson Reuters. Because cash flow is an organic measure of the strength of a business, it makes for a great valuation tool.Source: YChartsThe current yield of 5.66% is above average for what the yield has been over the past 10 years. The current yield is well off of highs that hit 7% a couple of times over that time frame. Based on historical data, the earnings multiple and FCF yield both indicate a very modest undervaluation of the stock.However, the execution risk and cloudy growth outlook for the company warrant a sizable margin of safety. An entry point of just over 16X earnings, or $40 per share should be sufficient to deliver appropriate total returns to investors without a huge degree of risk. It may seem overly conservative, but failure to execute could result in the market punishing shares. I don't want to be on the wrong side of that.Thomson Reuters is a solid company that generates healthy cash flows from its niche offerings to professionals. The recent Blackstone deal has changed the outlook of the business looking forward. Unfortunately, it is still too early to know just how bright the future is for Thomson Reuters. Because of the uncertainty, I want a valuation that offers upside in the event that the company under-delivers on its ambitions. Otherwise, an investment turns into a gamble.Author Disclaimer: Wealth Insights is an investor and investment author.

From 2014 onwards, the company has successfully endeavored to consolidate its holdings to cut costs. Income growth is expected to be moderate, as revenues are growing slowly, but expenses have decreased as the company successfully integrates different acquisitions into their overall business.The company has three main business lines:Besides the above, the company has a few other smaller business lines, including Reuters, a news organization, and an Enterprise Technology and Operations Group, which is being expanded in Toronto. Financial and Risk generates most of the company's revenues, but these are still reasonably diversified:(Source: Thomson Reuters 2Q2017 Report)Most of the company's products operate on a subscription basis, ensuring stable revenue and cash-flow generation for the company:(Source: Thomson Reuters 2016 Annual Report)The company generates most of its revenues in the Americas, although there is some diversification:(Source: Thomson Reuters 2016 Annual Report)The company's financial performance hasn't been particularly great for the last few years, although there has been some improvement in 2017. Revenues have decreased throughout the years, with a CAGR of -2% for the last five years, excluding discontinued operations. Revenue has been decreasing as the company consolidates and sells many of its products and services, and due to the anemic performance of many legacy products and services. EBITDA, on the other hand, has had 1.8% CAGR, on the back of decreased costs, as the company consolidates its product line, departments, office, and data center locations.Performance slightly improved in 2017, with revenue increasing by 2% on a YoY basis as of 2Q2017. Most importantly, operating profit increased 38% on a YoY basis, as costs decreased quite significantly.(Source: Thomson Reuters 2Q2017 Presentation)Moving forward, the company expects low revenue growth, further cost reductions, and therefore moderate income growth. Overall revenue growth will be hampered as the company's legacy products and services continue being eliminated, while costs are expected to go down as the company continues consolidating its operations.Thomson Reuters' business models ensure stable revenue and income generation, from the company's highly diversified revenue streams and subscription based service model. As a market leader in a mature industry, focusing on cost reductions, income is expected to grow in the single-digits for the coming years, as organic revenue growth has been, and will continue to be, anemic, and the company lacks any large initiative that could grow revenue significantly.Thomson Reuters currently has a dividend yield of 3.2%, and a FCF yield of 6.5%. The company has spent around the same on share repurchases and dividends in the last five years, although the share repurchasing program has significantly sped up recently.The company has spent around the same on share repurchases and dividends in the last five years, although the share repurchasing program has significantly sped up recently.(Source: Thomson Reuters 2Q2017 Presentation)The company has had 24 consecutive years of dividend increases, with the dividend having a CAGR of 2.8% for the last ten years. With a dividend payout ratio of only 57%, and the company's high percentage of recurring revenues, the company's dividend is extremely safe, and further increases are quite certain.Moving forward, the company expects further dividend increases and share repurchases. The company has already announced a $1 billion dollar expansion to its share repurchasing program, available until mid-2018. It is unlikely that the program can continue increasing at previous year's rates, as the company was generating quite a bit of cash from selling entire business lines and products to competitors in prior years. Management has given no guidance regarding its dividend increases, but low-single digit raises are common for the company.Investors in the company can expect further, moderate, dividend increases and share repurchase programs, as the company is able to consistently generate the revenue and cash-flow necessary for these, and management policy for further increases. Having said that, the potential for significant increases in either of these is unlikely, as the company's revenue and income growth hasn't been, and is unlikely to be, strong enough.The company's trailing P/E ratio of 33.2 is quite high, although this is mainly the product of the company's aggressive share repurchase agreements, and recent cost reductions that have yet to be completely reflected in the ratio. On the other hand, the company's forward P/E of 17.1 is slightly below the 18.8 of the S&P 500, quite good for a company with such stable business model. On the other hand, income growth for the company will probably lag behind the S&P 500, due to the company's legacy products and slow revenue growth during the last few years.Thomson Reuters business model has been successful in generating consistent revenues and cash-flow, which the company has used to continuously deliver increasing dividends and financing share repurchase programs. As the company's cost cutting measures continue delivering results, expect a continuation of the share repurchase programs, and further small dividend increases. As a mature company, with low organic revenue growth, don't expect significant upside potential, as income growth is likely to be in the low-mid single digits moving forward.Due to the above, Thomson Reuters would make a solid addition to any income or dividend portfolio, as the company's business model ensures stability and growth in the company's revenue, income, dividend, and stock price."
4086442,89805,2017-07-08T14:57:36-04:00,,"Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) has raised its dividend for 24 straight years and is arguably one of the safest sources of income in the market for investors living on dividends in retirement.The company's business benefits from selling mission-critical solutions and generates significant amounts of recurring revenue (86% of sales), which results in very predictable cash flow and a high Dividend Safety Score.Thomson Reuters has also been improving its earnings profile through various transformational strategies and expects its adjusted EPS to grow at a double-digit rate this year.Let's take a closer look at this reliable dividend growth stock to see if its future remains bright and if its valuation is reasonable today.Business OverviewThomson Reuters was created when Thomson acquired Reuters (a 160-year-old global news and financial data service) for about $17 billion in early 2008.Many of the company's solutions were assembled through hundreds of acquisitions made over the years. However, the organization is now focusing on growing organically and transforming into more of an integrated enterprise.Today, Thomson Reuters is the world's leading source of news and information for professional markets, selling electronic content and services primarily on a subscription basis.Its businesses provide solutions, software, and workflow tools which integrate its core data and information.Approximately 86% of Thomson Reuters' revenue is recurring and is derived from subscription or contractual arrangements, which most customers renew annually. About 93% of its revenue is from information delivered electronically or as software and services.By geography, Thomson Reuters generated 62% of its 2016 sales from the Americas, 27% from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and 11% from Asia Pacific.The company caters to the needs of various financial and risk, legal, tax and accounting, intellectual property and science and media markets in more than 100 countries.SegmentsIn October 2016, Thomson Reuters sold its Intellectual Property & Science business in order to focus more on global trade news and regulation opportunities. The company's business is now organized in three business units:Financial & Risk (55% of 2016 revenue; 48% of operating profit): provides critical news, information and analytics, enables transactions and connects communities of trading, investment, financial and corporate professionals. It also provides regulatory and risk management solutions. The segment has witnessed higher growth from Elektron Data Platform and Risk products as desktop revenues have been declining.Legal (31% of sales; 40% of operating profit): provides critical online and print information, know-how, decision tools, software and services that support legal, investigation, business, and government professionals around the world.Tax & Accounting (14% of sales; 12% of operating profit): provides integrated tax compliance and accounting information, software and services to professionals in accounting firms, corporations, law firms and government.Business AnalysisAt a high level, one of the first things to like about Thomson Reuters' business is that professionals will always need more of the data and analysis it provides.Knowing more about mission-critical topics (e.g., geopolitical risks, transformative technology, currency movements, regulatory changes, etc.) helps people make better informed decisions, adapt to change, solve tough problems, and create more successful outcomes.Thomson Reuters helps its customers accomplish these timeless objectives with its vast array of electronic content. As long as knowledge is valued by key decision-makers, there will be a need for Thomson Reuters' intelligence, technology and human expertise.Over the course of many decades, Thomson Reuters has established a strong position of trust, and its news has a reputation for speed and integrity.Many of Thomson Reuters' customers use its solutions as a part of their workflows, which has led to strong customer retention. As a result, the company maintains #1 or #2 market share positions in most of the segments that it serves.The company's deep industry knowledge, proprietary databases, trusted reputation, and embeddedness in customers' mission-critical workflows have all contributed to the company's moat.Replicating Thomson Reuters' unique databases, enterprise solutions, tools, and platforms would be an extremely costly and time-consuming endeavor, especially when you consider that many of its solutions have been built up from hundreds of acquisitions over the years.Thomson Reuters has even stated that it probably has more company data than any other corporation in the world.Customer contracts serve as another barrier to entry, although the majority of them are up for renewal every year. Despite the relatively short contract arrangements, Thomson Reuters' existing customers would need to be willing to take a chance on a lesser-known vendor to part ways with the firm.Such a move could reasonably be deemed as ""too risky"" in many cases given the importance of customers' workflows and their decision-making processes that have grown dependent on Thomson Reuters' solutions.As a result of customers' reliance on its solutions, Thomson Reuters has generally enjoyed annual price increases in the low single-digit range, which provide a nice recurring lift to profits.The company's continuously improving breadth, content, and capabilities help justify the price hikes and further strengthen long-term customer retention rates, which have historically hovered near 90% in its Financial & Risk segment.Thanks to Thomson Reuters' recurring revenue, relatively fixed cost base, economies of scale, decent pricing power, healthy customer retention, and business diversification (no customer is greater than 2% of revenues), the company has been a consistent free cash flow generator over the years:Source: Simply Safe DividendsDespite its strengths, the company has faced headwinds resulting from its acquisition spree, which saw the firm acquire close to 300 companies from 2003 through 2013 (most notably its $17 billion merger with Reuters in April 2008).These deals brought a growing mass of unrelated businesses, and soft customer growth trends following the financial crisis caused further challenges. The Reuters acquisition in particular was challenging as it caused a number of cultural issues, disappointing product launches, high employee turnover, and organizational complexities.As a result, Thomson Reuters put together a turnaround plan in late 2013 to restore organic growth, simplify operations, capture true economies of scale, rely less on acquisitions, and improve profitability.Thomson Reuters essentially acknowledged that its acquisition strategy resulted in a complicated infrastructure, an overgrown portfolio of products rather than an integrated enterprise, and a big company that wasn't taking advantage of its scale.The management team has now slowed down on acquisitions (16 acquisitions during 2014-2016 vs. 97 between 2011 and 2013). It also sold off its Intellectual Property & Science segment (close to 10% of sales) to focus more on its core businesses.As a result, Thomson Reuters has successfully registered its second consecutive year of organic growth in 2016 while improving its margins.Source: Thomson Reuters Investor PresentationThe company's new strategy focuses on an enterprise approach rather than a portfolio approach and drives attractive returns while maintaining a strong capital structure.This enables organic revenue growth, which achieves savings from simplifying processes and reinvesting in growing businesses. Thomson Reuters is also targeting a return on invested capital above cost of capital for the first time since 2007.Thomson Reuters has engaged in various simplification and productivity initiatives that have strengthened its core. The company founded Enterprise Technology & Operations (ET&O) at the beginning of 2016, unifying more than 10 functions into a single Enterprise team, for example.The company has also retired 110 legacy applications, closed a number of data centers, reduced its workforce by 25% since 2012, and consolidated 62 office locations to 230 locations from 520 in 2012. Thomson Reuters is simplifying its product portfolio as well by reducing the number of products by roughly 70% in the Financial & Risk segment alone.These transformational programs are designed to drive growth, improve retention, and efficiencies by accelerating organic growth and productivity gains.As Thomson Reuters continues simplifying and unifying its products while divesting non-core businesses, it hopes to show a meaningfully improved organic growth rate this year and beyond.As seen below, the firm is looking to generate 60% of its sales from ""Growth"" segments, such as Risk, Elektron Data Platform, Legal Software & Services and Global Tax, in 2017, up from just 48% in 2012.The company expects to see its growth profile gradually improve as well, as it allocates capital into faster-growing adjacent markets outside of its financial and legal research businesses.Source: Thomson Reuters Investor PresentationBy relying more on organic growth rather than M&A, the company is also holding onto more cash to return to shareholders in the form of repurchases and dividends.For example, Thomson Reuters completed 16 acquisitions between 2014 and 2016 for a cost of $316 million, which is significantly less than the 97 acquisitions made during 2011-2013 for a cost of $3.8 billion.Source: Thomson Reuters Earning PresentationThrough a combination of cost efficiency gains and incremental revenue growth (recall that Thomson Reuters' cost base is largely fixed), the firm should be poised for stronger earnings growth in the years ahead.Key RisksAlthough Thomson Reuters has considerably reduced its number of acquisitions and is showing good progress on its 2017 plan, the company still faces a handful of risks.Many of Thomson Reuters' markets are increasingly tech-driven, for example. Data is becoming cheaper, information is more accessible than ever before, and low technology costs (e.g. the cloud) have resulted in thousands of fintech startups trying to disrupt the old incumbents like Thomson, Bloomberg, and LexisNexis.These trends, which encourage more competition and innovation, will likely only intensify in the coming years.Additionally, some of Thomson Reuters' larger markets (e.g. banks, law firms) are struggling to grow headcounts due to heightened regulatory scrutiny and challenging economic conditions.Market saturation could lead to intensified competition and pricing pressures, making it all the more important for Thomson Reuters to stay ahead of customers' evolving needs to maintain its strong market share and profitability.The company still appears to have a large advantage as the incumbent, but smaller players will always be much faster-moving and quicker to adapt new, potentially disruptive technologies to further unlock the flow of valuable information.If competitors begin eroding Thomson Reuters' moat, it seems reasonable to expect a company as large as Thomson to struggle with generating profitable organic sales growth. As of today, however, the business appears to be performing well overall.Thomson Reuters has delivered positive organic revenue growth for two consecutive years, for example, and the company's Financial business has continued recording revenue growth over the past year.The Legal business has also seen its revenues grow (albeit modestly) despite declining U.S. print and transaction sales. Macro conditions have been strengthening, but the firm's initiatives have been driving some of the improvement in profitability and productivity.Thomson Reuters' Dividend SafetyWe analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend.Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question, ""Is the current dividend payment safe?"" We look at some of the most important financial factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more.Dividend Safety Scores range from 0 to 100, and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least 60. Since tracking the data, companies cutting their dividends had an average Dividend Safety Score below 20 at the time of their dividend reduction announcements.Thomson Reuter's Dividend Safety Score of 89 suggests that its dividend is very safe.The company's dividend is first supported by the firm's payout ratio. As you can see below, the company's free cash flow payout ratio has increased over the last decade from about 35% in 2006 to 50-60% more recently.The firm's payout ratio is expected to be around 60% this year, which is in line with recent years. Given the steadiness of Thomson Reuters' cash flow, this is a very reasonable payout ratio.Looking at a company's performance during the financial crisis can also be helpful when evaluating the safety of its dividend payment. If earnings are highly cyclical, the company has greater risk of needing to freeze or cut its dividend if conditions unexpectedly deteriorate.Thomson Reuters' reported results are skewed higher because of its acquisition of Reuters, which closed in April 2008.Adjusting for the acquisition and currency headwinds, the company's sales rose in 2008 and edged down by just 1% in 2009 despite meaningful weakness across many of its financial services customers. The company's stock also outperformed the S&P 500 by 12% in 2008.Since a high proportion of Thomson Reuters' revenues are recurring, its revenue patterns are generally more stable compared to other business models that primarily involve one-time product sales.In other words, the company's sales are typically slower to decline when conditions worsen, but they are also slower to return to growth when the economy improves. I like these types of stable business models that consistently generate cash.Thomson Reuters has also maintained an attractive margin profile over the last decade. Steady sales and high margins are often the sign of an economic moat.With plenty of recurring revenue, an ability to push through modest price increases, improved profitability from its transformation program, and a gradually expanding platform of products, Thomson Reuters is consistently profitable.Looking at the balance sheet, Thomson Reuters' stable business model allows it to responsibly maintain more debt than most types of companies.In fact, S&P has issued the company an investment-grade credit rating (BBB+) with a stable outlook.Thomson Reuters' average debt maturity is also 8 years and spread out nicely, which provides plenty of flexibility for the company to meet its obligations.Source: Thomson Reuters Earning PresentationAll things considered, Thomson Reuters' dividend payment appears to be quite safe. The company has a relatively high debt load, but its reasonable payout ratio, high recurring revenue, impressive dividend growth track record, and consistent cash flow all provide nice protection.Thomson Reuters' Dividend GrowthOur Dividend Growth Score answers the question, ""How fast is the dividend likely to grow?"" It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.Thomson Reuters' Dividend Growth Score is 29, suggesting that the company's dividend growth potential is below average.The company's low score reflects its very low sales growth rate, indebted balance sheet, and management's preference for small dividend increases in recent years.As seen below, the company's dividend has grown between 1% and 2% annually over the last five years.Given the company's target dividend payout ratio of 40% to 50% of its annual free cash flow, I wouldn't be surprised to see 1-3% annual growth continue until business growth accelerates.While Thomson Reuters' dividend growth rate is far from remarkable, it has been consistent. The company has paid out dividends consistently for over 30 years and increased its dividend for 24 consecutive years.Thomson Reuters is not eligible to join the S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index because it's not a member of the S&P 500, but it has been a reliable dividend grower.ValuationTRI trades at a forward P/E ratio of 18.5, a slight premium to the S&P 500's forward P/E ratio of 17.8, and offers a dividend yield of 2.9%, which is about in line with its long-term average yield.For a company with substantial recurring revenue, strong free cash flow generation, and stable business trends, it's not a big surprise to see its stock trade at a premium valuation multiple.While the company expects its adjusted earnings per share to grow by 13.5% in 2017, it seems unlikely that this business could generate more than mid-single-digit earnings growth over the long term.As a result, TRI's stock appears to offer annual total return potential of 7% to 10% (2.9% dividend yield plus 4% to 6% annual earnings growth).ConclusionThomson Reuters shares many characteristics with some of the best high dividend stocks in the market. The company has a long history of strong profitability and dependable dividend increases, almost all of its revenue is recurring, and management is taking actions to make the company more competitive.While Thomson Reuters' dividend growth rate has been fairly low over the last five years, management's transformation plan appears to be improving the company's organic growth, which could translate to faster payout growth over the coming years.The stock doesn't look like a bargain today, but it seems like a reasonable long-term hold as the company continues gaining organic growth traction."
4123314,101421,2017-11-10T11:17:56-05:00,Thomson Reuters has invested in data startup Enveil's $4 million financing round.Enveil has developed data security technologies that avoid the need for data decryption for search and analytics use.The deal likely provides Thomson with product pilot opportunities as well as potential investment return or acquisition possibilities if Enveil grows its offerings and business.,"Quick TakeThomson Reuters (TRI) has invested in a $4 million financing round for data security startup Enveil.Enveil has created what it calls ‘Never Decrypt’ data security capabilities that reduce security gaps during data search and analytics operations.Thomson Reuters is interested in Enveil for its internal data security initiatives as well as the likely potential for an inside track to acquisition should Enveil’s technologies catch on.Investee CompanyFulton, Maryland-based Enveil was founded in 2016 to develop improved data security through homomorphic encryption technologies that don’t require data to be decrypted to perform frequent search and analytics queries.Management is headed by founder and CEO Ellison Anne Williams, who was previously a Senior Researcher at the National Security Agency [NSA].Below is a brief video of Enveil’s approach to data security:(Source: RSA Conference)Enveil sells two services:The firm targets its system at five primary industries: Financial Services, Healthcare, Data Monetization, Audit & Compliance and Cloud Security.Investment Terms and RationaleAlong with Thomson Reuters, other investors in the current round included Bloomberg Beta and Data Tribe.Valuation in the round was not disclosed. This was Enveil’s first known round of financing since its founding in 2016.TRI is interested in Enveil’s solution for its internal purposes and I presume to pilot these technologies within its organization in addition to providing investment capital.As Bob Schukai, Global Head of Design, Digital Identity Solutions for TRI stated in the deal announcement,Thomson Reuters has not been a very active corporate investor in technology startups, investing in only a handful of companies.The graphic below shows its investment history by various metrics (click to enlarge):(Source: Mattermark)Thomson has focused its investment activity almost exclusively on software-enabled startups in enterprise, analytics, mobile, payment and banking spaces.Notably, it hasn’t been afraid to invest in early stages, probably due to its interest in helping startups with pilot projects in return for first-look access to new technologies of interest.TRI has invested geographically in the areas of the Northeast and Bay Area exclusively.While the investment in Enveil may be small in absolute terms, for a data-centric company such as Thomson, it makes a lot of sense.TRI gets inside access to the technology, can potentially help shape Enveil’s future and if the technology delivers as promised, it gets a more secure data environment.It also stands to gain the potential for financial return if Enveil becomes a bigger company or have an inside track to acquire Enveil should it gain traction in the marketplace.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

3988371,25120,2016-07-14T08:30:59-04:00,"Thomson Reuters sold its IP&S business at a fair price, allowing the company to reduce leverage in a substantial way.The sale takes place at fair multiples, as dilution will in part be offset by share buybacks.The pro-forma business trades at steep multiples if we simply look at GAAP earnings, as Thomson Reuters has very little growth to show for it.The craze for predictable businesses makes it so that I can easily avoid the shares given the premium valuation and the lack of growth.","Thomson Reuters (TRI) recently announced the sale of its Intellectual Property & Science business to funds related to Onex and Baring Private Equity. This announcement created a nice opportunity to revisit the investment thesis on the company.The divestiture of the smallest segment does not come as a surprise as the proceeds will in part be used to reduce leverage. With deal multiples being more or less in line with the rest of the business, I do not see a major impact on the overall valuation as a result of this transaction.The remaining business continues to face challenges including very slow growth. This makes shares not attractive in my opinion given the premium valuation and the very mediocre track record.The Sale Of IP&SThomson Reuters has agreed to sell its IP&S business for $3.55 billion in cash. The sale is quite significant, reducing the number of divisions from four to three, although the business is relatively small.The segment reported sales of $1.01 billion in 2015, with organic growth coming in at just 1% in constant currency terms. The attractive feature of the segment is the fact that nearly 80% of sales are ¨recurring¨ in terms of their nature. Segment margins of 22% are pretty decent as well, with Thomson fetching 11.3 times 2015s EBITDA contribution of $313 million.These are solid multiples given the modest organic growth. That being said, the business is very stable and predictable as the long term outlook remains solid given the importance of innovation and intellectual property in our economy.The Pro-Forma BusinessWith the sale of the IP&S business, Thomson will now focus on its three remaining business units: Financial & Risks, Legal and Tax & Accounting.The $12.2 billion in revenues being achieved in 2015 will fall towards $11.2 billion on a pro-forma basis. The company reported operating profits of $1.74 billion in 2015 on an overall basis while segment profits came in at $2.64 billion. The $221 million in operating profits reported by the IP&S segment are thereby provably overstated, as they exclude some corporate costs which are not allocated to the segment. As a result, I see overall operating profits fall towards $1.6 billion for the company.Thomson Reuters can surely use the proceeds from the sale as the business remains quite indebted. The company ended the first quarter of this year with $869 million in cash and $8.92 billion in debt. This net debt load of little over $8 billion will fall towards $4.5 billion on a pro-forma basis.The company posted EBITDA of $3.2 billion in 2015, but that will fall towards $2.9 billion following the sale of IP&S. That translates into a 1.5 times net leverage ratio. Given that the company already indicated that it will buy back $1 billion of its shares, the leverage ratio will come in at 1.9 times EBITDA.What About The Valuation?Thomson Reuters has 762 million shares outstanding which trade at $42, for a $32 billion equity valuation. If we add back the net debt load of $4.5 billion, the company is valued at more than $36 billion, for a roughly 12.5 times EBITDA multiple.The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.13 per share in 2015, for a relatively attractive 18 times multiple. There are some troubles with that number. Net earnings only came in at $1.60 per share, indicating that the GAAP multiple comes in at 25 times earnings. This is a major discrepancy and while it can largely be explained by non-cash amortization charges, Thomson Reuters has to keep investing into software and acquire new businesses in order to maintain its competitive position.As a result, I am looking at the $1.60 per share number reported for 2015 which will be further impaired due to the divestiture of the IP&S business.In this uncertain world with low rates, investors like to invest into predictable and stable businesses such as Thomson Reuters. These predictive capabilities and the dividend make an investment attractive on a relative base, although it seems odd to pay a +25 times multiple for a business which is not really growing.The issue which I have is that Thomson´s track record is very shaky as well. Following the acquisition of Reuters in 2007, the company has not delivered on any growth at all. Pro-forma revenues of $11 billion are below the $11.8 billion being reported for 2007 and peak revenues of +$13 billion in the years thereafter.At the same time, the outstanding share base has been flat over the past decade, while the company still employs quite some debt. Following the IP&S divestiture, net debt stands at $4.5 billion. This marks just a modest reduction from the $6.6 billion net debt load in 2008.No Growth, Why Pay Up For It?In essence, Thomson Reuters has shown zero growth over the past decade. As a matter of fact, topline sales are now down roughly 10%, while recent buybacks have not been sufficient to reduce the outstanding share base by a similar percentage, indicating that revenue per share is down.I have a very hard time to pay a 25 times earnings multiple based on 2015 results for such a company. This does not even take into account the dilution which might result from the sale of the IP&S business, although that transaction will reduce leverage in a substantial way.Part of the continued enthusiasm has to do with the stable dividend which now yields +3%. The other reason why investors might be enthusiastic relates to the 2017 targets which call for adjusted earnings of $2.30 per share. If we assume that GAAP earnings are 25% lower, as they have been in 2015, real earnings are seen just north of $1.70 per share.These projections rely heavily on organic growth and margin gains. Investors might be skeptical to believe management on its blue eyes. At least, I know that I am.Given the premium valuation multiples, lack of growth and a mediocre track record, I can only avoid the shares. The sale of the IP&S business is a nice move to reduce leverage, at fair multiples, but certainly does not improve the investment case in a substantial way."
4143048,25120,2018-02-05T06:21:13-05:00,"Thomson Reuters is selling most of its core F&R business to Blackstone and affiliates.The company will transform in a major way following this complicated deal.Thomson Reuters will be deleveraged a great deal, will be able to buy back many shares and even have room for bolt-on deals following this transaction.Estimating pro-forma GAAP earnings potential of $2 per share, combined with a very strong balance sheet and operating in faster growing industries, I am upbeat on the prospects.","Thomson Reuters (TRI) is selling a majority stake in its core F&R business in a rather complicated deal. This transaction has a few large benefits for Thomson Reuters including a much improved balance sheet, a great reduction in the share count and a much improved growth profile of the entire business going forward.I am rather upbeat on the prospects for the deal and the ""new"" Thomson Reuters following the transcription, even as there are quite a few unknowns at this point in time. For that reason, I will look forward to the developments with great interest, looking to initiate on dips from here onward.To understand the major transaction, which Thomson Reuters has executed last week, it is pivotal to first get a grip on the underlying business. The company generated revenues of $11.2 billion in 2016, and these revenues were fairly stable as they rose just a percent to the year before.The famous financial & risk business is the largest segment with $6.1 billion in sales and 20% operating profit margins. Legal is the second largest unit with $3.4 billion in sales, yet its 30% margins are very lucrative. Tax & accounting generates $1.5 billion in sales accompanied by 20% operating margins as well. The largest F&R business has seen long-term struggles as it is set to report growth in 2017, the first time since 2011.The naming of these segments makes it pretty self-explanatory what these businesses are doing, so no further explanation is required. While growth is not spectacular, certain other features of the business are appealing besides the high margins. This is notably the fact that over 85% of sales are recurring and even a greater percentage is derived from electronics and software & services.In November of 2017, Thomson Reuters announced third quarter results. Revenues for the quarter and first nine months of the year were up 2%, accompanied by modest margin expansion across the board. The modest growth makes that sales probably come in around $11.3 billion, which results in about $3.4 billion in EBITDA for the year.Fortunately, many of these D&A costs are very real not in terms of depreciation on real assets but mostly on amortisation charges on software among others. With D&A running at $1.5 billion, adjusted EBIT comes in around $1.9 billion a year.The company ended the quarter with $900 million in cash and equivalents and $7.1 billion in debt. This net debt load of $6.2 billion is very reasonable in relation to the earnings power of the business and the stable operations.The 716 million outstanding shares traded at $43 ahead of the transaction announcement, although that number rises to $37 billion if net debt is included. That values the business at around 3.2 times sales and 11 times EBITDA.Thomson Reuters is selling a 55% stake in its core F&R business to Blackstone and affiliates. The press release states that the entire F&R business is valued at $20 billion of which Thomson Reuters will see gross proceeds of an estimated $17 billion. This is comprised out of a $14 billion contribution made by Blackstone through the issuance of debt, as it will pay $3 billion in cash for its 55% equity stake. Reuters news will remain with Thomson Reuters as F&R will pay a minimum of $325 million per annum for the coming 30 years to secure access to the news.The $17 billion in gross proceeds will be used as follows: cash taxes and transaction costs are seen at $1.5-$2.5 billion, reducing the net proceeds to an estimated $15 billion.The company will furthermore pursue $1-3 billion in growth opportunities (internal + M&A) in the remaining fully owned legal, and tax & accounting business. Another $9-11 billion will be used to retire shares to offset the reduced earnings contribution of the divested business and $3 billion will be used to retire debt. Based on the fact that Blackstone valued the 55% equity stake at $3.0 billion, the remaining 45% stake held by Thomson Reuters could be valued at nearly $2.5 billion.Now things get tricky. Based on the discussion above, we know that Thomson Reuters operates with roughly $6 billion in net debt as it will cut this net debt load in half to $3 billion. We furthermore know that the company aims to buy back $10 billion (plus or minus a billion) worth of shares. At $43 per share that allows the company to buy back 232 million of the 716 million outstanding shares.We furthermore know that the company reserved about $2 billion for M&A opportunities (plus or minus a billion) and that the remaining 45% equity stake in the F&R business is valued at around $2.5 billion. The 484 million shares (after share repurchases) are valued at nearly $21 billion at $43 per share. We know that net debt is cut in half to $3 billion, as the remaining $2 billion reserved for dealmaking and $2.5 billion stake in F&R actually results in an enterprise valuation of $19.5 billion on a pro-forma basis.The remaining business is comprised out of a $3.4 billion legal business with operating margins of 30% and EBITDA margins of 37%. Tax & accounting is a $1.5 billion business with nearly 21% operating margins and EBITDA margins of 30%. That yields a $5.9 billion business in terms of sales, although Thomson Reuters reduces this to $5.6 billion in the pro-forma deal presentation.Assuming that margins remain as reported, the pro-forma business generates $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.2 billion in operating earnings. The new business will now operate without leverage (assuming additional deals are not pursued), which makes that $1.2 billion in EBIT yields after-tax earnings of $960 million with a 20% tax rate, for real GAAP earnings of $2 per share.The structure of the deal was rather complicated as has been seen in the uncertain share price in response to the announcement. Shares initially jumped from $43.5 to $48, in a move that added $3.2 billion in valuation to Thomson Reuters, but by Friday, shares had retreated to $42.5 per share. This reduced the value of the firm by $4 billion in comparison to the initial move in the share price.The multiples for the deal look reasonable. The transaction values F&R at 3.3 times sales, the same as the overall valuation of Thomson Reuters at 3.2 times. The same can be said for the EBITDA multiples of the transaction. That does not leave a lot of potential to create a lot of value, especially as Thomson Reuters will be on the hook for $2 billion (plus or minus half a billion) in separation costs, including taxes.The good news is that the remaining business is actually growing sales more quicker than the F&R business, which boost the overall growth profile. Another benefit is the much reduced debt profile of the business and potential upside on the $2.5 billion equity investments, which Thomson Reuters still has in F&R.That said, a great deal of the final outcome will depend on the levels at which share repurchases will be executed on, how high separation costs will become and which deals will be pursued. Nonetheless, an unleveraged business has the potential to post pro-forma earnings of $2 per share (GAAP), while it will be largely unleveraged, has a better growth profile and operates in much more attractive growth markets.While a 21 times pro-forma earnings multiple seems highs, I note that the business is largely unleveraged and that greater focus on these businesses should unleash further potential, although that still has to be seen in the coming year/years. I have a largely neutral to slightly upbeat stance towards the deal as I will be looking with great interest to see how trends will evolve in the coming year, looking to add at levels below the $40 mark."
3993592,101982,2016-07-30T18:36:30-04:00,Thomson Reuters reported second quarter that missed analyst estimates but organic growth in Financial and Risk division remains intact.Management reiterated guidance and positive growth so we could see gradual recovery in the second half.Current valuation is at the high-end of the group so there is little room for disappointment in the next quarterly report.,"Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) missed its second quarter earnings mainly due to lower revenue and weak margins in its Legal and Tax & Accounting division. The company reported revenue of $2.769b which is a 1% decline from the prior year and this missed the analyst estimate of $2.827b while EBITDA declined 2% from the prior year and came in at $757m. Earnings per share of $0.50 was a penny higher than the analyst estimate of $0.49. The company also reaffirmed its 2016 guidance and now expects single-digit revenue growth, EBITDA margin of 27.3% - 28.3% and free cash flow of $1.7b to $1.9b.In my view, the weakness in Legal and Tax & Accounting was weaker than expected so this caused the sell off after earnings. For the week, Thomson Reuters' stock fell 4% compared with the S&P TSX that was flat so this was definitely not a good result. However, I think that the focus for this company will be on its softer organic revenue, especially in Financial and Risk division. Management highlighted that this division will continue to see positive sales growth and this is important because this division represents organic growth of the company. We could see gradual recovery in the second half as discount from prior platform migration will largely be factored in so this is not as bad as it seems.When it comes to organic trends, overall growth was flat as the trends in Financial and Risk were offset by the trends in Legal, Tax & Accounting. Financial and Risk saw a slight decline due to a 17% drop in recovery revenue but the good news is that recurring revenue did not change and this once again supports my organic growth thesis. As long as recurring revenue remains intact, I think we could see better year-on-year comparisons going forward. However, a troubling sign is starting to emerge in the Peer Index Monitor for Legal activity in the US that interestingly showed a decline for the first time after 9 straight quarters. This could potentially be a concern in that the underlying growth of the industry may see a pull back. I am not ready to conclude this early because this is only one data point but this is definitely an area to be aware of.Looking below the revenue, EBITDA margin declined by 20bps mainly due to Tax and Accounting but once again Financial and Risk margins held up really well. Tax & Accounting was impacted by the recent projects that the company undertook but since the project is largely done, I do not see this to be an issue going forward.In conclusion, second quarter numbers were weak and there is no sugar-coat this but the strong guidance on organic growth in Financial and Risk in the second half was clearly a positive. I continue to see Thomson Reuters becoming a more focused company and I will hold this view for now. 2016 will progress slower than many people expected so we will have to wait until 2017 for more clarity on whether all the divisions will grow close to its full potential. Right now, Thomson Reuters is trading at 20.5x Price/Earnings ratio and 11.5x Price/Cash Flow ratio, which is at the high-end of its peer group so there is little room for disappointment. As we have observed this quarter, the stock underperformed the index by 4% after the earnings so if it underperforms again then we could see price/earnings ratio contract to 15x-17x, which is more in-line with its peers."
3989642,24491,2016-07-19T23:29:57-04:00,"There aren't many firms like Thomson Reuters that have such a strong dividend yield accompanied by a decent Dividend Cushion ratio (near parity).
        Thomson Reuters' fundamentals could be better, but we like the company's strong free cash flow generation and solid balance sheet.
        Let's discuss this income idea in greater depth and derive a fair value estimate for shares. It should be on income investors' radar screens, if it isn't already.","By The Valuentum TeamThomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) may not have an elevated Dividend Cushion ratio like that of many of its peers, but it's more a function of the size of its dividend obligations than anything else. It's dividend yield is fantastic! We're big fans of the company's track record of returning cash to shareholders, with more than $14 billion dished out in share buybacks and dividends since 2004. More recently, buybacks have taken a larger share of the capital returned, but a steadily-increasing dividend has become the norm at Thomson Reuters. Improving EBITDA and operating margins will help fuel free cash flow expansion, and with nearly 90% of its business recurring, there's so much to like. Thomson Reuters boasts 20+ consecutive years of dividend increases.Image Source: Thomson ReutersWe're big fans of one of the world's leading sources of information for businesses and professionals, but we have to acknowledge the firm's Dividend Cushion ratio, which is near parity. The company does have a nice, balanced revenue stream, however, and its predominantly subscription-based business offers significant visibility. Proprietary databases act as considerable barriers to entry for smaller rivals, and management's commitment to maintaining a strong and stable capital structure is quite encouraging. The company will look to build on its consistent free cash flow generation in 2016 and beyond, and we'd like to see more capital go to deleveraging initiatives than buybacks at the moment.Let's dig deeper.Thomson Reuters Corp's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Thomson Reuters Corp is a source of information (human intelligence, industry expertise and innovative technology) for businesses and professionals. It delivers insight to the financial and risk, legal, tax and accounting, IP and science and media markets. The company has a nice, balanced revenue stream.• The firm continues to sustain profitability in its core US legal business and capture global growth opportunities in its tax & accounting segment, while its IP & science group drives subscription expansion. Proprietary databases act as considerable barriers to entry for smaller rivals.• Thomson Reuters Corp has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 19.7% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.5 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 39.9%. Roughly 90% of revenue is recurring.• The company is organized in four business units: 1) financial and risk -- news and analytics, 2) legal -- information to support legal and investigative purposes, 3) tax & accounting -- tax compliance and accounting information, and 4) intellectual property & science -- IP and science information.• We're big fans of the company's track record of returning cash to shareholders, with more than $14 billion dished out in share buybacks and dividends since 2004. Thomson Reuters boasts 20+ consecutive years of dividend increases.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Thomson Reuters Corp's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 11.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of GOOD. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Thomson Reuters Corp's free cash flow margin has averaged about 11.6% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Thomson Reuters Corp, cash flow from operations increased about 36% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 0% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think Thomson Reuters Corp is worth $38 per share with a fair value range of $29.00 - $47.00.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our nearterm operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 1% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of -2.8%. Our model reflects a 5- year projected average operating margin of 23.4%, which is above Thomson Reuters Corp's trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Thomson Reuters Corp, we use a 9.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $38 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Thomson Reuters Corp. We think the firm is attractive below $29 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $47 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Thomson Reuters Corp's fair value at this point in time to be about $38 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Thomson Reuters Corp's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $47 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $38 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

3960846,50662,2016-03-24T14:30:37-04:00,"Thomson Reuters did reduce its share buyback rate in Q4 2015, allowing the company to reduce its net debt by a high double-digit number.Thomson Reuters is currently trading at an anticipated free cash flow yield of almost 7%.The high net debt is still worrying me, but the strong operating and free cash flow are supporting the debt to be serviced.Suspending the buybacks for one year would reduce the net debt/EBITDA ratio by approximately 0.3.","IntroductionThomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) is one of the largest information providers in the world, and as this is quite a capex-light business model, this company is destined to generate a substantial amount of free cash flow. That indeed seems to have been the case in 2015 as well, but I mainly wanted to find out if Thomson was still 'overspending' on share buybacks. I absolutely don't mind when a company deploys cash to buy back its own stock, but I think a) a company should only do so when it's undervalued and b) it should do so within the limits of its own cash generating capacity.TRI data by YChartsThe full-year results are inI have been keeping an eye on Thomson Reuters in 2015, and I always dove deep into the company's statements as I wanted to check up on two facts. First of all, I wanted to find out how the company was coping with the differences on the foreign exchange market, and secondly, I wanted to see how much free cash flow the company was generating.Source: Financial statementsIn the fourth quarter of 2015, Thomson's top line saw a 2% reduction in revenue, but if you'd neutralize the impact of the strong US dollar, the revenue would have increased by approximately 2%, on an organic basis! The Q4 revenue fell to $3.15B, but the operating profit was hit much harder as it fell from $1.34B to $503M. There's no reason to be alarmed, as last year's (exceptionally high!) operating profit was caused by a $963M higher 'other operating gain'. This was non-recurring and if you'd look at the adjusted operating income, Thomson Reuters actually performed better this year as the operating profit increased by more than 30%. The net income in the final quarter was $408M (attributable to TRI's shareholders), resulting in an EPS of $0.53 per share.That's pretty nice considering the full-year EPS was 'just' $1.6 per share, which basically means Thomson Reuters generated 1/3rd of its net profit in just 1/4th of the financial year. For the entire financial year, the revenue fell by approximately 3% (indicating the company's ability to limit the damage was working pretty well). The operating margin was 14.2% and that's quite nice!Source: Financial statementsI was however extremely interested in the Q4 and FY 2015 cash flow statements, and I really appreciate that the company has provided a separate Q4 cash flow statement (instead of just a full-year statement like so many other companies do). In the entire financial year, Thomson generated $2.84B in operating cash flow, but after adjusting this result for changes in Thomson's working capital position, the adjusted operating cash flow increases to $3.02B. The capex also increased by 3.5%, but even after deducting the capital expenditures, the net free cash flow (on an adjusted basis) was $2.02B, or $2.64/share (based on the 765M outstanding shares as of at the end of last year).And the company continues to buy back a lot of shares to reduce its share count as fast as possibleAfter combing through the company's financial results after the third quarter of 2015, I said the company wasn't expensive but that I'd prefer a slower buyback rate and Thomson spending some cash on reducing its net debt rather than issuing more debt to fund the share buybacks.TRI Ordinary Shares Number (Quarterly) data by YChartsIt now indeed does look like Thomson reduced its repurchase program in the fourth quarter of last year, as the company spent just $167M on share repurchases. If you'd isolate the Q4 cash flows from the full-year results, Thomson generated an adjusted operating cash flow of $790M in Q4 and a free cash flow of $530M. Of this $530M, Thomson spent just $248M on dividends as well as $167M on buybacks which means the total cash outflow to reward its shareholders was just 78% of the incoming free cash flow. An additional 12% was used to reduce the company's net debt, and this actually is a ratio I prefer much more than a company overspending on share buybacks.Source: Company presentationIndeed, the Q4 repurchase rate was much lower than the full-year average. Whereas Thomson spent just $167M on buybacks in Q4, it spent a total of $1.42B on buybacks in the entire financial year, which results in an average repurchase rate of almost $420M per quarter! This meant the company spent a total of $2.4B on dividends and share repurchases despite having generated just $2.02B in adjusted free cash flow.Source: Company presentationFor 2016, the company continues to plan to spend $1.5B on share repurchases, and this could enable Thomson to repurchase approximately 35 million shares (on a net basis), reducing the share count to 730 million. As the US dollar has been weakening a bit lately, its Q1 financial results might actually contain a positive surprise as the lower USD might increase the USD-based revenue. I also think Thomson should have no problem to keep its free cash flow stable at $2.02B, which would mean the FCF/share will increase to $2.76.Investment thesisI still don't feel very comfortable to see Thomson Reuters borrowing cash to fund its buyback addiction, but its aggressive buyback program is definitely proving its value as the company will reduce its share count to less than 700M by the end of next year. I also expect the buyback rate to be reduced when the company reaches its targeted net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.5.Based on a FCF/share of $2.76 for this year, the free cash flow yield is approximately 6.95%, which is quite appealing. And the high net debt position? Well, if the company would suspend its buybacks for one year, the net debt could be reduced by $1B (or 15%)."
3998785,97486,2016-08-11T11:39:34-04:00,"Reuters News has been a part of my daily routine for some time, buts its owner, Thomson Reuters Corp., has never caught my investing attention before.Here I pass TRI through my five tests looking at its FCF strength and valuation.TRI performs well; even though its does not pass all five tests, it looks like it will soon.","Reuters news has formed part of my daily routine longer than I can remember. Each morning and most evenings I scan the business pages to find out what is going on. Yet I admit its parent company, Thomson Reuters Corp. (NYSE:TRI) — formed in 2008 when Canada's Thomson Corp. bought Britain's Reuters Group — has never appeared on my investing radar. Setting aside my Reuters reading for the day, I thought it was about time I did take a look at it. As a result, I thought I would run it through my five FCF tests.I occasionally use these tests to form the first steps in my analysis of a company. Although far from exhaustive, they give me a good indication of its competitive advantages, its FCF health and efficiency, as well as the debt and dividend position. Fair value based on FCF alone is also calculated to give a little taste of whether it offers value today. These tests merely mark the first step in what may develop into a more thorough analysis of the business in the future.So let's get started on running this media giant against my FCF rules.A Little About Thomson ReutersFirst off, let's take a more general look at Thomson Reuters. Despite being my main introduction to Thomson Reuters, their Reuters News segment is by far their smallest, contributing less than 3% of total revenue and actually failing to bring in a profit. At the moment they are also in the process of seeing their Intellectual Property & Science segment (including their Web of Science brand) being sold for $3.5 billion meaning that their largest Financial & Risk segment now constitutes about 55% of total revenue with their Legal segment (another one I am fairly familiar with through their WestLaw brand) adding an additional 30%. Tax & Accounting fills in the remaining revenue share left over:This is a fairly nice looking segmental diversity. However, what is more interesting to me is the fact that only 7% of their revenues are derived from print sources (mostly in the legal segment) and 87% of revenues come from subscription payments. Both are appealing traits for me. A focus on electronic or services delivery as well as the reliability of recurring, subscription based revenue is very appealing indeed. Thomson Reuters thus reflects a lot of the things that I also found attractive in fellow media giant RELX (NYSE:RELX) when I reviewed them a while back.Thomson Reuters' revenue is also pretty nicely geographically diversified:Certainly the Americas compose the lion's share of their revenue. Yet it is clear that they generate a healthy amount from non-American sources too. Indeed, in underlying terms, the non-American share is actually larger as it has been hard hit by the strong USD.All in all, therefore, Thomson Reuters appears to pack a lot of media punch. With strong looking global brands across a healthy range of attractive media segments, they certainly have a great deal of appeal to an investor. Anyway, let's move onto testing their FCF credentials to see whether an investor really should be tempted.1: Positive Free Cash FlowOur first test is a simple one. All I want to see is that Thomson Reuters has generated positive FCF for each of the last ten years. In this regard Thomson Reuters starts off very well indeed:Although FCF has been pretty range bound with a figure around the $1.5 billion mark quite common, it is clear that the company consistently generates hefty amounts of FCF. For me at this stage this is exactly what I am looking for. Thomson Reuters thus gets off the start line with a nice PASS.2: CROIC: Cash Return on Invested CapitalNext we have a more challenging dive into the company: the CROIC test. CROIC (or, cash return on invested capital) is calculated by dividing their FCF by the sum of their total debt and shareholders' equity and gives us an indication of how efficiently a company generates their FCF. A CROIC of 10% suggests that for every $100 of capital invested in the business they generate $10 in FCF. This is a very attractive rate of return and, indeed, is the pass mark we are looking for here.So how does Thomson Reuters fare on this front? Not particularly well:With an 10-year average CROIC of just 6.6% at present, Thomson Reuters fails-even though it has a healthy generation rate-to cross my targeted 10% figure. This is not the full story, however. It is very encouraging to see their CROIC figure has been markedly improving since 2012 with it hitting a post-Reuters acquisition high of 8.6% last year.Also, judging from their progress so far in 2016 there is the potential for them to improve upon this further by the end of 2016. In the first six months they have managed to generate higher FCF figures courtesy of a higher OCF and lower CapEx:If the second half of 2016 contributes as much to their full-year CROIC figures as in 2015 they could, in fact, cross my 10% threshold by the end of the year:As a result, although I have to give Thomson Reuters a FAIL mark at the moment it is certainly worthwhile watching their progress in the near future. It looks as though they could see themselves ahead of my targeted CROIC very soon.3: FCF to Debt RatioNext we turning our attention to the matter of debt. Here I want to see that Thomson Reuters has a healthy coverage of its debt levels from a FCF perspective. To ascertain this I use the FCF/Debt ratio. Ideally I want to see the ratio at 25% or more. What this means, in theory, is that Thomson Reuters could repay their entire debt load in four years or less using FCF alone.So how does Thomson Reuters do? Well, to be honest, not superbly:The average over the last decade has sat at 21.6%. Yet, clearly, in the last five years this average has been much lower. Nonetheless, clearly they have been improving on this front with them dragging the FCF/Debt ratio back in line with the 10-year average.On the plus side, we can perhaps expect to see this shift higher in the future too as Thomson Reuters announced that the $3.5 billion gained from the IP & Science sale is expected to be split with:Clearly, how much of this actually pays down debt and how much FCF leaves with the IP & Science segment is unclear. Yet with total debt at just $8.6 billion in 2015, any amount of debt paid down would make a fairly significant impact.Although we have to give Thomson Reuters a close FAIL right now, it is clear that things are looking much stronger for the company in the future. Again, one to watch.4: FCF YieldOver the last few years, Thomson Reuters has provided investors with a healthy looking dividend yield which has generally (except in 2012) been covered healthily by FCF:Yet here I am looking to assess the future potential of the dividend. Consequently I am looking to see a historic FCF yield (in other words, the yield if they paid out all FCF as a dividend) of 3.5% or more. In turn, I'd like to see the historic FCF payout ratio at 75% or less.Thomson Reuters does very well on this front:Clearly, with a FCF yield of nearly 5.75% Thomson Reuters easily passes my 3.5% target. What is more, with only ~56% of their FCF being paid out to service their dividend it easily ducks beneath my 75% payout threshold.Again, Thomson Reuters picks up a PASS here.5: FCF ValuationFinally, it is time to turn to the matter of valuation. Instead of the more familiar PE ratio, here I use the EV/FCF (enterprise value to FCF) ratio. Quite simply, here all I look for is a share price below that of the calculated EV/FCF fair value.First we need to ascertain the historic average EV/FCF ratio at Thomson Reuters. Taking a look at the historic EV/FCF valuation of Thomson Reuters over the last decade we come out with an average of 24.3:However, I like to adjust this by removing the outliers (that is, those years more than 1.5 times greater or less than 0.5 smaller than the average). In Thomson Reuters case there is only one year which is an outlier above the upper bound (red box). Setting this year aside, provides us with an adjusted average of 22.2. It is this valuation ratio that I will use as my fair value ratio.Next we have to predict the FCF figure for the next two years. I have provided a more detailed explanation on how I work this out elsewhere. Using this method suggests FCF figures of $1.51 billion and $1.55 billion in FCF in 2016 and 2017, respectively. I then average these two FCF figures (making $1.53 billion) and feed this back into the EV/FCF calculation at the historic multiple of 22.2.Doing so provides us with a EV/FCF fair value of around $44.50. With Thomson Reuters currently trading at just under $42 it suggests that it is currently trading about 6% below its historic fair value. As a result, Thomson Reuters scores a PASS on this test.ConclusionThomson Reuters only manages to pass three of my five FCF tests here. Yet this does not seem to tell the whole story. What is clear is that they are making some serious progress with regards to the two tests-the CROIC and FCF/Debt ones-which they failed. Neither of these failures were huge ones and there is reason to believe that come the end of FY2016 they will be in a position to pass them should I run the test once more.Thomson Reuters has some very attractive media assets across an appealing cross section of segments. Combined with what is certainly a very strong cash flow generation ability, it has certainly earnt itself a place on my watchlist going forward. With a strong, generous dividend yield and an apparently slightly undervalued share price it may well be an appealing buy right now. I am certainly tempted. For now, I will keep watching as their quarterly results lead us to FY2016 and get to know the company a little better. Nonetheless, Thomson Reuters has certainly caught my attention due to its strong if far from perfect performance above, attractive current assets and current strategic transformation.Notes: Unless otherwise stated, all graphs, tables and the calculations contained within them were created by the author.

        Let's take a look at the firm's investment considerations as we attempt to uncover the drivers behind its Dividend Cushion ratio.","By The Valuentum TeamThomson Reuters' Dividend Cushion ratio is near parity.--> Thomson Reuters Corp (NYSE:TRI) is a source of information (human intelligence, industry expertise and innovative technology) for businesses and professionals. It delivers insight to the financial and risk, legal, tax and accounting, IP and science and media markets. The company has a nice, balanced revenue stream.--> The firm continues to sustain profitability in its core US legal business and capture global growth opportunities in its tax & accounting segment, while its IP & science group drives subscription expansion.

We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 18.7% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.4 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 36.4%. Roughly 90% of revenue is recurring.--> The company is organized in four business units: 1) financial and risk -- news and analytics, 2) legal -- information to support legal and investigative purposes, 3) tax & accounting -- tax compliance and accounting information, and 4) intellectual property & science -- IP and science information.--> We're big fans of the company's track record of returning cash to shareholders, with more than $14 billion dished out in share buybacks and dividends since 2004. Thomson Reuters boasts 20+ consecutive years of dividend increases.Note: Thomson Reuters' dividend yield is above average, offering a ~3.5% yield at recent price levels. Thomson Reuters boasts a solid yield, but we think the company is one for the watch list, if only because its Dividend Cushion ratio could be better. Let's walk through several of its key investing merits.Dividend StrengthsThomson Reuters may not have an elevated Dividend Cushion ratio like that of many of its peers, but it's more a function of the size of its dividend obligations than anything else. We're big fans of the company's track record of returning cash to shareholders, with more than $14 billion dished out in share buybacks and dividends since 2004. More recently, buybacks have taken a larger share of the capital returned, but a steadily-increasing dividend has become the norm at Thomson Reuters. Improving EBITDA and operating margins will help fuel free cash flow expansion, and with nearly 90% of its business recurring, there's so much to like. Thomson Reuters boasts 20+ consecutive years of dividend increases.Dividend WeaknessesWe're big fans of one of the world's leading sources of information for businesses and professionals, but we have to acknowledge the firm's Dividend Cushion ratio, which is near parity. The company does have a nice, balanced revenue stream, however, and itspredominantly subscription-based business offers significant visibility. Proprietary databases act as considerable barriers to entry for smaller rivals, and management's commitment to maintaining a strong and stable capital structure is quite encouraging. The company will look to build on its consistent free cash flow generation in 2016 and beyond, and we'd like to see more capital go to deleveraging initiatives than buybacks at the moment.From the Comments Section: How to Interpret the Dividend Cushion Ratio -- A Ranking of RiskAs for how to interpret the Dividend Cushion ratio, itself, it is a measure of financial risk to the dividend, much like a credit rating is a measure of the default risk of the entity. Said differently, a poor Dividend Cushion ratio of below 1 or negative doesn't imply the company will cut the dividend tomorrow, no more than a junk credit rating implies a company will default tomorrow. That said, the Dividend Cushion ratio does punish companies for outsize debt loads because in times of adverse conditions, entities often need to shore up cash, and that means the dividend becomes increasingly more risky.We think investors should look at a variety of different metrics in assessing the sustainability of the dividend. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is systematically applied across our coverage, it can be used to compare entities on an apples-to-apples basis. Dividend payers with significant free cash flow generation and substantial net cash on the balance sheet often register the highest Dividend Cushion ratios, as they should. These companies have substantial financial flexibility to keep raising the dividend.Dividend SafetyWe think the safety of Thomson Reuters' dividend is good. Please let us explain.First, we measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying dividends well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Dividend Cushion™ ratio, which we make available on our website. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing net cash a company has on hand (on its balance sheet) plus its expected future free cash flows (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected cash dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends and the expected growth in them.As income investors, however, we'd like to see a ratio much larger than 1 for a couple of reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. For Thomson Reuters, this ratio is 1, revealing that on its current path the firm should be able to cover its future dividends and growth in them with net cash on hand and future free cash flow.Dividend Cushion Ratio Cash Flow BridgeThe Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge, shown in the graph below, illustrates the components of the Dividend Cushion ratio and highlights in detail the many drivers behind it. Thomson Reuters' Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge reveals that the sum of the company's 5-year cumulative free cash flow generation, as measured by cash flow from operations less all capital spending, plus its net cash/debt position on the balance sheet, as of the last fiscal year, is less than the sum of the next 5 years of expected cash dividends paid.Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is forward-looking and captures the trajectory of the company's free cash flow generation and dividend growth, it reveals whether there will be a cash surplus or a cash shortfall at the end of the 5-year period, taking into consideration the leverage on the balance sheet, a key source of risk. On a fundamental basis, we believe companies that have a strong net cash position on the balance sheet and are generating a significant amount of free cash flow are better able to pay and grow their dividend over time.Firms that are buried under a mountain of debt and do not sufficiently cover their dividend with free cash flow are more at risk of a dividend cut or a suspension of growth, all else equal, in ouropinion. Generally speaking, the greater the 'blue bar' to the right is in the positive, the more durable a company's dividend, and the greater the 'blue bar' to the right is in the negative, the less durable a company's dividend.Dividend Cushion Ratio DeconstructionThe Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction, shown in the graph below, reveals the numerator and denominator of the Dividend Cushion ratio. At the core, the larger the numerator, or the healthier a company's balance sheet and future free cash flow generation, relative to the denominator, or a company's cash dividend obligations, the more durable the dividend. In the context of the Dividend Cushion ratio, Thomson Reuters' numerator is smaller than its denominator suggesting weak dividend coverage in the future. The Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction image puts sources of free cash in the context of financial obligations next to expected cash dividend payments over the next 5 years on a side-by-side comparison. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio and many of its components are forward-looking, our dividend evaluation may change upon subsequent updates as future forecasts are altered to reflect new information.Please note that to arrive at the Dividend Cushion ratio, divide the numerator by the denominator in the graph below. The difference between the numerator and denominator is the firm's ""total cumulative 5-year forecasted distributable excess cash after dividends paid, ex buybacks.""Dividend GrowthNow on to the potential growth of Thomson Reuters' dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity the company has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. To do so, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in the past 10 years, the company has a nice dividend growth rate, and a solid Dividend Cushion ratio, we characterize its future potential dividend growth as good, which is the case for Thomson Reuters.Because capital preservation is also an important consideration to any income strategy, we use our estimate of the company's fair value range to assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss. In Thomson Reuters' case, we currently think shares are fairly valued, meaning the share price falls within our estimate of the fair value range, so the risk of capital loss is medium (our valuation analysis can be found by downloading the 16-page report on our website). If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low.Wrapping Things UpWe're fans of Thomson Reuters' balanced revenue stream. The firm has sustainable profitability coming from its US legal business while it continues to capture global growth opportunities in its tax and accounting segment. The company has a strong track record of returning cash to shareholders, as evidenced by its strong dividend yield. This high yield has an impact on the firm's Dividend Cushion ratio, which could be stronger. Perhaps the largest threat to the pace of future dividend growth at the moment is the prospect for competing capital allocation options to take a larger share of cash used. We would like to see some deleveraging moving forward at Thomson Reuters, but we do not expect material pressure on the health of its dividend.Breakpoints: Dividend Safety. We measure the safety of a firm's dividend by adding its net cash to our forecast of its future cash flows and divide that sum by our forecast of its future dividend payments. This process results in a ratio called the Dividend Cushion. Scale: Above 2.75 = EXCELLENT; Between 1.25 and 2.75 = GOOD; Between 0.5 and 1.25 = POOR; Below 0.5 = VERY POOR.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

3987752,101982,2016-07-12T05:17:20-04:00,"Thomson Reuters is selling its IP and Science business to private equity for $3.55bn.
        This is a positive for Thomson as it becomes a more focused company by selling non-core assets.
        Investors can expect organic growth to slowly kicking in later this year and early next year.","Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) is selling its IP and Science business to private equity funds affiliated with Onex and Baring Private Equity Asia for $3.55bn in cash. This segment only accounts for 8% of Thomson's total revenue so not a material contributor but does mark a move by the company to unload its non-core asset so it can sharpen its focus on the core segments. The sale is expected to close in the next few months and Thomson plans to spend $1bn of the proceeds to fund share buybacks and the rest to pay down debt and reinvest in new business.I believe that this is the right move for Thomson because the company can focus on financial and risk segment that account for over half of its revenue. Given the tougher trading environment, some banks have scaled back on financial services products so it is important for Thomson to reinvest in its business and stay competition. In addition, competition from other vendors such as Capital IQ (which belongs to Standard & Poor's) and FactSet have also increased their marketing to the firms by selling a higher tier products at the same price as their existing Thomson product in a way to steal shares from Thomson, so a certain degree of reinvestment is required for Thomson to take on the competition.Going forward, I think investors should focus on Financial and Risk, and Legal divisions that account for a combined 85% of the total revenue on a pro-forma basis. In the Financial & Risk division, Thomson is expected to wind down Thomson One AM, which is its last major legacy product, by March 2017. This adds visibility to this division's revenue growth as this segments shifts to organic growth, and this is important in that this segment will be important in driving the sustainable and profitable growth for the company.So far the company has done a good job improving margins as it seeks to generate cost saving through the Enterprise Approach, which is aimed at integrating large number of platforms from the 2008 Reuters acquisition. However, the most important part will be driving the organic revenue in this segment. Although Thomson has executed on this plan, it still faces risks given the uncertain financial market environment. The company's new products such as the Eikon that competes directly with Bloomberg and FactSet, Elektron that focuses on workflow and enterprise data management, and Lipper that focuses on data and analytics for funds are all compelling products and could present interesting opportunities in the coming years.In conclusion, I am positive on the deal given that this allows Thomson to streamline its divisions and become a more focused company. I recommend investors to accumulate for long-term organic growth starting later this year and early 2017."
3796856,89805,2016-01-07T14:46:17-05:00,"TRI has been a very reliable dividend grower for more than 30 years.The company's business model is sturdy with 87% recurring revenue and strong client retention.With a 3.8% dividend yield and a modest P/E multiple, is TRI a buy?","Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) has raised its dividend for 22 straight years and is one of the most consistent free cash flow generators around. The company's business benefits from significant amounts of recurring revenue (87% of sales),While TRI's rate of dividend growth is modest, we believe the company's 3.8% dividend yield and current valuation are attractive. For these reasons and more, we hold TRI in our Conservative Retirees dividend portfolio.Business OverviewTRI was created when Thomson acquired Reuters (a 160-year-old global news and financial data service) for about $17 billion in early 2008. Many of the company's solutions were assembled through hundreds of acquisitions made over the years.Today, TRI sells electronic content and services to professionals, primarily on a subscription basis. Its businesses provide solutions, software, and workflow tools which integrate its core data and information. Approximately 87% of TRI's revenue is recurring, and 92% of its revenue is from information delivered electronically, software, and services.By geography, TRI generated 60% of its 2014 sales from the Americas, 30% from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and 10% from Asia Pacific.SegmentsBusiness AnalysisThinking big picture, one of the first things we like about TRI's business is that professionals will always need more data and analysis. Knowing more about mission-critical topics (e.g. oil prices, geopolitical risks, currency movements, regulatory changes, etc.) helps people make better informed decisions, adapt to change, solve tough problems, and create successful outcomes.TRI helps its customers accomplish these timeless objectives with its vast array of electronic content. As long as knowledge is valued by key decision-makers, there will be a need for TRI's type of solutions.Over many decades of operation, TRI has established a strong position of trust with its customers. The Thomson Reuters brand ranked #57 on the list of Best Global Brands and has helped the company maintain #1 or #2 market share positions in most of the segments that it serves. For example, over 85% of Fortune 500 companies use TRI's legal research offerings.TRI's deep industry knowledge, proprietary databases, trusted reputation, and embeddedness in customers' mission-critical workflows have all contributed to the company's strength.New entrants struggle to match the breadth of TRI's enterprise solutions, which have been built up by hundreds of acquisitions over the last decade alone. Replicating TRI's unique databases, tools, features, and platforms would be an extremely costly and time-consuming endeavor. TRI has even stated that it probably has more company data than any other corporation in the world.Customer contracts serve as another barrier, although the majority of them are up for renewal every year. Despite the short contract arrangements, TRI's existing customers would need to be willing to take a chance on a lesser-known vendor to part ways with TRI. Such a move could reasonably be deemed as ""too risky"" in many cases given the importance of customers' workflows and decision-making that has relied on TRI's solutions.As a result of customers' dependence on its solutions, TRI has generally enjoyed 2% price increases each year. The company's continuously improving breadth, content, and capabilities help justify the price hikes and further strengthen long-term customer retention rates, which hover near 90% in its largest segment (Financial & Risk).Thanks to TRI's recurring revenue, relatively fixed cost base, economies of scale, strong pricing power, great customer retention, and business diversification (no customer is greater than 1.5% of sales), the company has been a wonderful free cash flow generator over the years:Source: Simply Safe DividendsDespite TRI's strengths, the company's acquisition binge (TRI completed nearly 300 acquisitions between 2003 and 2013), growing collection of unrelated businesses, and weak customer growth trends following the financial crisis have resulted in several headaches.The company's most notable acquisition by far was its $17 billion merger with Reuters in April 2008. The idea was to create a giant in the financial information market serving banks and investment managers around the world.However, like many large deals, it came at a very inopportune time - right before the financial crisis. Macro challenges have caused TRI's financial segment to decline every year since 2008 up until last year, when it recorded its first growth. The Reuters acquisition resulted in cultural issues, failed product launches, management turnover, increased organizational complexity, and an incredibly disappointing stock.As seen below, TRI's total shareholder return (TSR) has substantially trailed the market since 2008 (a falling line means the market outperformed TRI's stock that year).Source: Simply Safe DividendsMuch of the company's management team turned over during the past few years, including the CEO and CFO positions. TRI put together a turnaround plan in late 2013 to restore organic growth, simplify operations, capture true economies of scale, rely less on acquisitions, and improve profitability.With a refreshing dose of humility, TRI acknowledged that its acquisition strategy has resulted in a complicated geopolitical infrastructure, an overgrown portfolio of products rather than an integrated enterprise, and a big company that lacks true scale.As an example of TRI's transformation program at work, the company's financial segment had more than 850 products in 2013. That has been reduced to fewer than 200 today and will be reduced to three platforms once all of the work is done.As TRI continues simplifying and unifying its products while divesting non-core businesses (e.g. TRI recently announced it is exploring strategic options for its intellectual property and science business, which accounted for 8% of sales in 2014), it hopes to show a meaningfully improved organic growth rate by 2017. As seen below, TRI is looking to generate 60% of its sales from ""Growth"" segments in 2017, up from just 48% in 2012. The company expects to return to organic revenue growth in fiscal year 2015 and should see its growth profile gradually improve as it allocates capital into faster-growing adjacent markets outside of its financial and legal research businesses.Source: Thomson Reuters Investor PresentationProduct simplification is also improving TRI's cost structure and freeing up more cash to be returned to shareholders. TRI expects to achieve savings of $400 million by 2017 as its consolidated platforms capture economies of scale and fund ideas that can be better leveraged across the existing business.By leaning more on organic growth rather than M&A, the company is also holding onto more cash to return to shareholders in the form of repurchases and dividends. For example, TRI completed just five acquisitions in 2014 for a total cost of about $167 million, which is significantly less than the 28 acquisitions it made in 2013 for $1.2 billion.Putting it all together, management believes TRI can compound earnings at a double-digit rate from 2013 to 2017, resulting in total earnings growth in excess of 50%. The bulk of the increase is being driven by cost efficiency gains and incremental revenue growth (recall that TRI's cost base is largely fixed).Source: Thomson Reuters Investor PresentationKey RisksAs we hinted at above, TRI's M&A strategy has been a double-edged sword. On one hand, it has helped the company develop an extremely valuable asset base that is difficult to replicate.On the other hand, it has clearly created an overly complex and fragmented product and cultural infrastructure. TRI is showing good progress on its 2017 plan, but it's still far from being a risk-free endeavor.Beyond company-specific execution risk, TRI's markets are increasingly tech-driven. The reality is that data is becoming cheaper, information is more accessible than ever before, and low technology costs (e.g. the cloud) have resulted in thousands of fin-tech startups trying to disrupt the old incumbents like TRI, Bloomberg, and LexisNexis. These trends, which encourage more competition and innovation, will only intensify in the coming years.Furthermore, some of TRI's larger markets (e.g. banks, big law firms) are struggling to grow headcounts due to heightened regulatory scrutiny and challenging economic conditions. Market saturation could lead to intensified competition and pricing pressures.In other words, it's more important than ever before for TRI to stay reasonably ahead of customers' evolving needs to maintain its strong market share and profitability. We think the company still has a large advantage as the incumbent, but smaller players will always be much faster-moving.If competitors begin eroding TRI's moat, it seems reasonable to expect a company as big as TRI to struggle with generating profitable organic sales growth. As of today, the business appears to be performing well.TRI's Financial business has recorded six consecutive quarters of positive net sales (as of the third quarter of 2015). The Legal business also saw revenues grow by 1% and would have been up by 3% excluding print revenues. It's also worth mentioning that TRI's Financial & Risk segment posted its first year of sales growth since 2008 in 2014. Macro conditions have been strengthening, but TRI's initiatives have been driving some of the improvement.For 2015, management expects positive organic revenue growth from all of its existing businesses and increased free cash flow generation compared to 2014. For now, it seems like TRI is keeping its competitors at a safe distance.Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend.Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question, ""Is the current dividend payment safe?"" We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.TRI's dividend Safety Score of 54 suggests that its dividend's safety is about average. The company's payout ratios are a little higher than we prefer and it maintains a lot of debt on the balance sheet. However, its cash flows are very stable, and management is still squeezing out some earnings growth. It's also hard to ignore the company's commitment to the dividend with 22 consecutive years of growth.Over the last four quarters, TRI's dividend has consumed 54% of its earnings and 70% of its free cash flow. As seen below, the company's free cash flow payout ratio has increased over the last decade from about 40% in 2005 to 60-70% more recently. Given the steadiness of TRI's cash flow, we aren't overly concerned by its payout ratio.Source: Simply Safe DividendsLooking at a company's performance during the financial crisis can also be helpful when evaluating the safety of its dividend payment. If earnings are highly cyclical, the company has greater risk of needing to freeze or cut its dividend if conditions unexpectedly turn south.TRI's reported results are skewed higher because of its acquisition of Reuters, which closed in April 2008. Adjusting for the acquisition and currency headwinds, TRI's sales rose in 2008 and edged down by just 1% in 2009 despite meaningful weakness across many of its financial services customers. The company's stock also outperformed the S&P 500 by 12% in 2008.Because a high proportion of TRI's revenues are recurring, its revenue patterns are generally more stable compared to other business models that primarily involve one-time product sales. TRI's sales are typically slower to decline when conditions worsen, but they are also slower to return to growth when the economy improves. We like these types of stable business models.Source: Simply Safe DividendsTo go along with its stable sales growth patterns, TRI has maintained an attractive margin profile over the last decade. Steady sales and high margins are often the sign of an economic moat. As we previously mentioned, TRI has a relatively fixed cost base. With plenty of recurring revenue, an ability to push through modest price increases, and a gradually expanding platform of products, TRI is consistently very profitable.Source: Simply Safe DividendsTurning to the balance sheet, TRI's stable business model allows it to maintain more debt than most companies. The company has over $10 of book debt for every dollar of cash, but its entire debt balance could be retired with cash on hand and three years of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).Source: Simply Safe DividendsTRI's average debt maturity is also 9 years, which provides plenty of flexibility for the company to meet its obligations.Source: Thomson Reuters Investor PresentationAll things considered, we believe TRI's dividend payment is quite safe. However, we wouldn't mind seeing the company's debt balance reduced a bit - you just never know what could happen, and we sleep better at night with more financial flexibility.Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question, ""How fast is the dividend likely to grow?"" It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.TRI's dividend Growth Score is 32, suggesting that the company's dividend growth potential is below average. The company's score was reduced because of its above-average payout ratios, very low organic sales growth, and stretched balance sheet.TRI targets a dividend payout ratio of 40% to 50% of its annual free cash flow and, assuming management hits its 2015 free cash flow guidance, the company is meaningfully above that range currently (closer to 60%). However, free cash flow available to shareholders should improve as TRI's spending on acquisitions remains much lower than it has been historically.As seen below, the company's dividend has grown at a 2-3% annual rate over the last five years, and we wouldn't be surprised to see 1-3% annual growth continue until business growth accelerates.Source: Simply Safe DividendsWhile TRI's dividend growth rate is far from remarkable, it has been consistent. The company has paid out dividends consistently for over 30 years and increased its dividend for 22 consecutive years.TRI is not eligible to join the S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index because it's not a member of the S&P 500, but it has been an extremely reliable dividend grower.ValuationTRI trades at 16x forward earnings and offers a dividend yield of 3.8%, which is about in line with its five year average dividend yield of 3.9%.For a company with substantial recurring revenue, strong free cash flow generation, and reasonable business trends, the company's earnings multiple appears very reasonable.If management can start generating 2-4% organic growth and high-single digit earnings growth in the next several years, the stock looks to have great value today and appears to offer 9-12% annual total return potential.ConclusionTRI shares many characteristics with our favorite blue chip dividend stocks. The company has a long history of strong profitability and dependable dividend increases, almost all of its revenue is recurring, and management is taking action to make the company more competitive for years to come.While TRI's dividend growth rate is fairly low, its 3.8% dividend yield appears to be a very reliable source of income. Should management continue executing the turnaround plan and rejuvenate earnings growth, we think dividend growth could also improve over the next five years."
3388745,50662,2015-08-04T02:25:52-04:00,"Thomson Reuters seems to be in a position it can afford a continuously increasing dividend.
        The company is spending half its free cash flow on share repurchases, and this will boost the EPS and free cash flow yield.
        I expect Thomson Reuters will be able to repurchase 3% of its common shares every year.
        The upcoming maturity date of a $600M 6% bond could result in TRI's interest expense dropping by $15-25M per year.","IntroductionOne would think financial news and data providers would generate decent returns and would have robust operating and profit margins, so I decided to comb through Thomson Reuters' (NYSE:TRI) financial statements to find out if this dividend-paying and share-repurchasing company meets my investment criteria as the company has spent almost $4B in shareholder rewards in the past 20 months.The Q2 and H1 financial resultsJust like so many other companies, Thomson Reuters got hit by the strong US Dollar, and its revenues were impacted by 6%. Instead of being able to report a 2% revenue growth based on a stable currency exchange ratio, Thomson Reuters' top line showed a 4% decrease to $3.04B. Despite this setback, the operating profit increased by $24M to $405M mainly due to the sale of a part of the company's business (so the operating profit was higher due to a non-recurring event).Source: financial statementsDue to a much lower tax bill ($14M vs $40M), Thomson Reuters' net profit increased to $281M, resulting in an EPS of $0.33 per share for the second quarter and $0.72 for the first half of the year. That means Thomson Reuters is trading at in excess of 20 times its net profit, but that's not really surprising as I would expect the capital expenditures to be lower than the current depreciation and amortization rate of $864M (see the blue highlight in the previous image) in the first half of this year.Source: financial statementsMoving over to the cash flow statements, Thomson Reuters had an operating cash flow of $1.17B, but this was negatively impacted by a $308M change in TRI's working capital position. If you'd add that amount back to the equation, Thomson's adjusted operating cash flow would have been $1.48B, resulting in a positive free cash flow of $950M for the first half of this year. Not bad at all!Unsurprisingly, Thomson spent $512M on dividends (which has now been put at $1.34 per share per year), but this is expected to decrease in the second half of the year (as Thomson will save on dividend payments by reducing the total amount of shares). TRI also spent $696M on share repurchases and even though the company was overspending on this (by $250M), the situation is still under control).Thomson has started another $1B share repurchase program - but is that a smart thing to do?That being said, even though Thomson has announced another $1B share repurchase program, I would hope the company keeps its repurchasing rate 'limited' to a maximum of (adjusted free cash flow - dividend payments), and on an annualized basis, this would mean TRI could repurchase $850M worth of stock without entering the 'overspending' territory.So it looks like the share buybacks will only have to be throttled back by 15%, and $850M worth of shares would buy you in excess of 21M shares at today's share price. As that's almost 3% of the total amount of outstanding shares, you could expect the FCF per share to increase by 3% per year, resulting in a continuously increasing dividend as well.Let's look at the bigger picture here. Let's assume TRI spends $850M per year on share buybacks in the next 3 years at respectively $40/share, $42/share and $45/share. That would reduce the total share count from the current 784M shares to 724M shares.Right now, the adjusted FCF/share is $2.42, so the current dividend of $1.34 per year would represent a payout ratio of 55%. Using 724M outstanding shares, the FCF per share would increase to $2.63 per share, and if TRI would keep the payout ratio stable, it can increase its dividend to $1.44 per share.Source: financial statementsI would usually not be keen on investing in a company with a $1.5B working capital deficit and an additional $7B in long term debt, but as Thomson is generating a reliable stream of cash flows, it gets a lot of credit from the market resulting in lower interest rates. In fact, I would expect the company to refinance its $600M 6% bond due in March 2016 at a 4% lower interest rate, resulting in a cash saving of $24M per year which will have a direct impact on the bottom line, allowing the company to repurchase another half million shares. As Thomson Reuters is paying in excess of $400M per year in interest expenses, reducing the cost of debt could potentially have a huge positive implication.Investment thesisThomson Reuters is currently trading at a free cash flow yield of 6%, and I expect this to increase to 6.6% by the end of 2017 due to a lower amount of outstanding shares. However, TRI has borrowed a lot of money, so its CFO will have to make tradeoffs between shareholder rewards and reducing the net debt as Thomson Reuters will have to refinance $3.1B of debt within the next 36 months.TRI isn't expensive right now, but I'd like to buy it as a bargain, so I'm considering writing a Put 35, maturing in January 2016 and I'd hope to receive $0.75 for that option when TRI is having a weak day on the market. That would increase the FCF yield to in excess of 7.6%."
2149313,32101,2014-04-19T08:55:07-04:00,"Thomson Reuters is fully priced in context of recent results.Yet it is in a turnaround -- the logic of which is very compelling.In the context of a turnaround, Thomson Reuters is pretty attractive. It is worth watching. The corporation has been buying back stock at prices higher than today.","Thomson Reuters Corp. (NYSE:TRI) is a 160-year-old news and financial information firm. It is the industry leader, or a close second, in many of its product categories. It is controlled by the Canadian firm Woodbridge (55% ownership). Being Canadian themselves, they file 40-Fs with the SEC and their accounting is in IFRS, the international accounting standard.For such an old company, it is a sign of the times that they receive 91% of their 2013 revenues from information delivered electronically. Further, 87% of the company's revenues are recurring.Some of the company's revenue sources are in decline (2013 40-F, p. 72):The company still achieved $1.1 billion in free-cash-flow in 2013 (a 3.9% yield). Adjusted for a large pension contribution in Q4 2013, free-cash-flow would have run $1.6 billion or a 5.7% yield. These yields imply that the corporation's $27.9 billion valuation is somewhat generous, but not overly so due to the business model of recurring revenue via electronic delivery. This works out to create a lot of cash. As Thomson Reuters writes themselves:So despite some challenges, to be outlined shortly, the business is quite a good one in terms of cash generation. Take a look at the company's cash from operations history:(Note that the steep decline at the far right is due to the 2013 pension contribution.)This business has produced plenty of cash -- over the last few years, a lot of this cash was used for acquisitions. But as management noted in the quote above, TRI is tempering its enthusiasm for acquisitions. As they noted at investor day, these acquisitions have not been well integrated historically: ""While we are big, we do not have scale.""In 2013, 2012, and 2011 they purchased 28 companies, 29 and 39 companies. These purchases have created a lot of ""water"" on the balance sheet since many of these businesses are extremely asset light and therefore the purchase prices contain large amounts of goodwill -- about $16.8 billion as of December 31, 2013:You might ask: why has goodwill been declining? The declines are mostly accumulated impairment charges, which have occurred over time. They imply some acquisitions were a bit too pricey. According to Note 18 in the 40-F, the corporation paid about $19.8 billion over the fair value of the assets of the businesses it has acquired (i.e., goodwill). Of that, $2.97 billion has been impaired (or about 15% of the original premium to fair value). US GAAP does not give us the ""gross goodwill"" and ""accumulated goodwill impairment"" numbers, although I sure wish it did.In the IFRS, they do impairments over business units, which the accounting masters have coined ""Cash-Generating Units"" or (""CGUs""). As of March 2014 and according to the 40-F, the CGU ""Financial & Risk"" is worth only 13% more than its implied value (counting goodwill) on the balance sheet. This basically means that if this business continues to face difficulties, as they did in 2013, then we could see more impairment on this CGU. This particular CGU contains old operating units, which have already taken a $3 billion write down in 2011.Of course, these impairments are merely accounting adjustments but they enforce the reason why management is attempting to move away from acquisitions. Thomson Reuters has had mixed results in its recent buying spree and now it needs to spend some time integrating these different units -- see ""Internal Reorganization"" below. Let us first look at their problem segment.The Financial & Risk SegmentThis segment is TRI's biggest business with around 52% of revenue. One of the products in this segment is the Thomson Reuters Eikon. This product was (and still is) getting creamed by Bloomberg. Here are two articles, which demonstrate this:1. Article on Feb 11, 2014. Summary: Thomson Reuters cannot take advantage of Bloomberg's mistakes.2. Article on December 2, 2013. Summary: Bloomberg is rated the best by users, Thomson Reuters, with its second place market share, is basically rated the worst.I recommend the second article, particularly if you want to see how TRI's Eikon compares with the competition. From that article, one can see that S&P's Capital IQ (a subsidiary of McGraw-Hill (MHFI)) is clearly the most competitive with Bloomberg and it gets the best rating for ""Price/Return on Investment."" FactSet (NYSE:FDS), a firm only about the 1/14th the size of Thomson Reuters, gets significantly better grades than Thomson Reuters.In the main, Thomson Reuters is the largest competitor to Bloomberg. But Bloomberg, in this product category, is the clear winner. This implies that S&P Capital IQ, Thomson Reuters, and FactSet are essentially competing for the #2 position in many categories. Given the premium pricing of Bloomberg's product, the #2 position is still extremely valuable since you get an enormous benefit of price differentiation.Take a look at this market share graph out of article #2 above:Just look at Bloomberg's dominance. It is an impressive level of market share to say the least; too bad it is not a public company. In sum, Thomson Reuters is facing pressure -- and its historically poor product quality does not suggest that this pressure will let up just yet.Of course, the Eikon product only produces ¼ of the revenues of the Financial & Risk CGU -- so the segment could improve by other means. Furthermore, in the most recent conference call (2/12/2014), management states they've:In total, Thomson Reuters' Eikon desktop represents $1.7 billion in annual revenue -- a significant chunk but still only 13.3% of consolidated revenues. If you would like to see a short demonstration of the new, apparently much improved, Eikon desktop, check out this investor day presentation (I also recommend that investor day presentation in general). The Eikon demonstration starts a little after hour 2.Growth BusinessesThe company's law, accounting and government businesses are all doing well and growing. This is most likely due to the increasing level of government regulation, particularly in the financial industry. These structural trends are favorable to TRI's business.ReorganizationLike a few other businesses with a portfolio of companies and a digital distribution presence, the company is reorganizing internally to an ""enterprise model"" (their word choice, not mine). Presumably, the corporation was operating under the multi-divisional form, with each division being its own profit and loss center and therefore with responsibility for the P&L at the division level. This, in the case of TRI, created a lot of duplication. For instance, management noted that they ingested corporate 10-Ks multiple times and tortured the 10-K with natural language processing in different divisions. They would like to build a technology information structure whereby they only need to ingest the 10-K once. Further the new cloud scalable architecture makes centralizing these functions dramatically easier. Using cloud infrastructure provided by other companies has already resulted in the closing of 41 data centers. On top of the simplification of the technological infrastructure, they also seek to simplify their product line.The corporation has the resources and businesses to achieve significant cost advantages and scale -- however the story told by management paints a picture of a long integration. But despite the impression of a long road to integration, management said in the most recent conference call:In total, they seek to eliminate $400 million in expenses through 2017.It we muse from a macro perspective, it is clear that the advent of massive and scalable cloud computing architecture has forced multi-divisional corporations to centralize their technology functions. The centralization of the technology function seems to drive the corporation to centrally integrate in other ways. Thomson Reuters is in the same boat as quite a few other companies who are centrally integrating their technology base.DebtThe debt seems pretty manageable in light of the corporation's historic free-cash-flow. See p. 53 of the 40-F for the maturity schedule of the debt.ValuationWhile Thomson Reuters' business should, in theory, be asset light, its ROA does not reflect this. This is because of their acquisition spree, which has created a large amount of goodwill on the balance sheet. But underneath the ROA of around 5% (using adjusted free-cash-flow for 2013) there is still a business with favorable dynamics -- if they can integrate their acquisitions and if they can grow organically. The business model is inherently attractive: if all their recent acquisitions had been developed internally, the company's ROA would likely be fantastic.Hence, Thomson Reuters has many opportunities in front of it. It has lots of cash, lots of customers, and, in some cases, a very competitive market share.The corporation estimates that it will produce between $1.3 and $1.5 billion in free-cash-flow in the coming year. This is a yield of about 4.6% to 5.3%. Given the quality problems of the corporation and the competitive pressures on its biggest businesses, this makes the corporation fairly valued.However, I should note that the corporation ""anticipate[s] repurchasing $1 billion of stock by year-end"" which could very well drive up the price. Of that $1 billion program, $300 million was repurchased in Q4 2013. Throughout 2013, the company paid an average price of $36.79 for its shares (current share price: $34.85).Further, after having watched the investor day presentation, I believe once their transformation and cost reduction programs are complete this corporation will likely perform significantly better. As noted, we may see results of these moves in 2015. In context of the transformation, I would argue TRI is on the cheap side -- but, then again, the transformation isn't quite over.ConclusionIf Thomson Reuters were growing organically, today's valuation would be attractive. But considering the faltering of some of the corporation's businesses in terms of quality, the lack of organic growth, and, further, the evidence that the corporation has probably been overpaying for its acquisitions, it seems TRI should fall into the watch bucket. One is paying a full price for the corporation despite some execution problems.Thomson Reuters has a fantastic name and it still has a fantastic position. The transformation is rational and may greatly improve the operating position of the corporation. So watch the turnaround/transformation -- perhaps things will get worse before they get better, creating a future opportunity in the shares.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are those of the author as of the date the article was published.

2887186,81716,2015-02-05T08:13:22-05:00,"Thomson Reuters is at a critical juncture in its turnaround and Q4 2014 will be a vital quarter to assess whether the turnaround strategy can deliver sustained results.TRI's stock performance will be driven by the company's ability to deliver on the promised 50% increase in EPS heading into 2017.This article discusses seven key indicators that investors should pay attention to in the upcoming earnings call on February 11, 2015.","Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) is a turnaround story. After years of stagnation and erosion in the top-line of some of its key segments, the company has finally started to show signs of a turnaround in 2014. In my opinion, Q4 will be a key quarter to ascertain whether some of these positive developments are as a result of sustained trends, or whether they are merely anomalies. I will discuss some of these key trends that investors should watch out for in the upcoming earnings call on February 11, 2015.In the 2014 analyst day presentation, management gave guidance around their turnaround plan and how they aim to deliver quantifiable results, as shown below. In my opinion, the ability to deliver on these targets will be the key driver for TRI's stock performance. Specifically, TRI aims to increase EPS by 50% over four years from $1.83 in 2013 (excluding the $275 million charge in Q4, 2013) to $2.80 in 2017 through a three-pronged approach. Top-line growth is expected to contribute $0.25 to $0.35 of this EPS growth, while scale initiatives are expected to deliver another $0.55. The remaining growth will be achieved through capital strategy initiatives including share buybacks.My biggest concerns lie in the company's ability to deliver on the top-line growth target. In order to deliver on the revenue targets of $0.25-$.35 per share, TRI's revenues need to grow with CAGR in the 3.25% to 4.47% range. Given the challenging macroeconomic environment in two of TRI's key segments - F&R and Legal - I am especially concerned about the company's ability to meet these targets.In addition to revenues, the cost-side story is especially important in the Finance and Risk (F&R) segment. The company has laid out an ambitious target to save $400 million/year in costs, and to improve EBITDA margins in the F&R segment to 30% by 2017. While the company has already made headway to achieve these targets, there is uncertainty around where the last $100-$200 million of savings will come from.In light of these challenges in meeting their revenues and cost-saving targets, investors should pay special attention to the following items in the upcoming earnings call:1) Positive Eikon net sales: Net sales is a key measure in the desktop segment, and is calculated as the number of subscriber additions minus the number of subscriber cancellations. Net sales for the Eikon desktop turned negative in 2010, and have remained negative until Q2, 2014. Because net sales is a leading indicator of revenue growth, a positive trend in net sales continuing into Q4 will signal strength in this key segment.2) Pricing point of new Eikon desktops: The Eikon is principally an alternative to the Bloomberg desktop and is offered in 13 different packages. In contrast to Bloomberg's one-size-fits-all offering, the 13 different Eikon products are offered at different price-points and allow TRI to meet user needs at a lower price. While the product offering is a compelling story to capture market share from Bloomberg, new Eikon desktops may not be coming in at the same price-point as their legacy predecessors, or as the full-blown Eikon desktop. Consequently, even though net sales may be positive, the added desktops may not be contributing as much to the top line as their predecessors. Guidance around pricing of the Eikon product will be especially important in the earnings call.3) Increase in transaction revenues: Transaction revenues are quite profitable for TRI. However, trading volumes have been dismal in recent years when compared to historical levels. Just a couple weeks ago, Goldman Sachs reported that revenues from its trading business dropped 13% in 2014. In my opinion, TRI requires modest growth in transaction revenues in order to meet its 30% EBITDA target in the F&R segment. Markets were quite volatile in Q4 2014, and it will be interesting to see how this high volatility translated into revenues for TRI.4) Positive organic growth in legal: Since Q2 2013, the legal segment has experienced negative organic growth until Q3 2014. Continued positive organic growth will be a vital signal to gauge the health of this segment. Decline in U.S. print revenues have been eroding Legal's top-line. However, TRI's investments in growth segments of the business have offset some of these declines; revenue growth in the solutions businesses has been especially strong. Positive organic growth in the top-line will be a strong vote of confidence in management's strategy.5) Continued strong growth in Tax and Accounting (T&A): T&A has been a beacon of hope out of all the segments that TRI operates in. The market for global tax solutions has been strong and T&A has benefitted from this development. The corporate and professional segments, in particular, have delivered solid organic growth. Investors should be anticipating growth in Legal's organic top-line growth to be in the high single digits in Q4.6) Organic growth and margin improvement in IP&S: Although IP&S has clocked organic growth in the low single digits in the previous quarters, margins are a bit of a concern in my opinion. Investors should be looking for positive organic growth and stable or improving EBITDA margins in this segment.7) Major changes to capital strategy: Although share buy-backs are a positive development for shareholders, any major increases to TRI's repurchase program may be an unwelcome sign. In my opinion, if management is unable to deliver on the revenue or cost portion of the 2017 EPS target, they may be inclined to make up the deficit through additional share repurchases (or acquisitions). Investors should view such a development with skepticism.In summary, TRI is at a critical juncture in its turnaround and Q4 will be a vital quarter to assess whether the turnaround strategy can deliver sustained results."
3655006,50662,2015-11-05T22:32:23-05:00,"Thomson Reuters had an excellent third quarter, boosting its adjusted free cash flow to $1.5B in the first nine months of the financial year.TRI is still overspending on shareholder rewards, and the continuous share buybacks are boosting the per-share results.The current free cash flow yield is approximately 6.3%, but I'd also like to see the company reducing its share repurchases in favor of reducing its net debt.","IntroductionBack in August, I wrote an article about Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) concluding the company is generating a massive amount of cash flow and is using the cash flow to reward its shareholders. The entire free cash flow (and actually even more) is being spent on dividend payments and share repurchases.The share price drop in August was a nice opportunity to get in, but I stuck with my original plan and tried to write a put option with a strike price of $35 as I'm looking for bargains.The Q3 results contained no surprises and the currency volatility was expectedI don't think Thomson Reuters needs any introduction at all as I dare to bet every user of the Seeking Alpha platform knows this world player in the information (dissemination) business. As it's one of the few major news outlets with a global reach, Thomson Reuters is in a pretty good position to continue to perform very well considering there aren't a lot of competitors.That's also visible in the company's revenue for the third quarter of 2015. Yes, okay, TRI's revenue fell by 4% compared to the same quarter last year, but this was only due to a negative impact of the currency exchange rates. In the accompanying presentation and in the conference call, Thomson's management explained the volatility on the currency markets had a huge impact on the financial results.Source: quarterly reportDespite the currency setback, the underlying results (taking the currency fluctuations into account) were still pretty decent as the company's operating profit was approximately $419M. In fact, its pre-tax income actually increased due to a lower interest expense and lower 'other' finance expenses. The net profit increased by 17% to $293M, bringing the net profit for the first nine months of the current year to $894M, an 11% increase. However, as Thomson Reuters continues to repurchase shares, the EPS increased by almost 15% on the back of a lower amount of outstanding shares!When a currency is moving against you, it could be pretty difficult to keep your cash flows stable, but Thomson did more than just keeping it stable, it was actually able to increase its (adjusted) operating and free cash flow in the first nine months of the current financial year, compared to 2014.Source: quarterly reportIn the first nine months, the adjusted operating cash flow was $2.23B (excluding a negative impact of $400M due to a change in its working capital), and as Thomson spent less than 1/3 of that amount on capital expenditures ($743M), its adjusted free cash flow was approximately $1.5B.Increasing the buyback rate - a good or a bad idea?Generating approximately $1.5B in free cash flow is pretty good and the strong Q3 could mean Thomson is on track to beat my original expectations of $1.9B in free cash flow. So how was its free cash flow in the first nine months of the year spent?Thomson is a very loyal dividend payer and has been increasing its dividend almost on an annual basis. Approximately 50% of the company's free cash flow was spent on dividend payments ($765M), but Thomson Reuters also spent $1.25B on share buybacks. Whilst that's ultimately a good move that will increase the EPS and free cash flow per share, it's pretty clear Thomson is 'overspending' on buybacks (as the total shareholder rewards are higher than the adjusted free cash flow), and it's interesting to point out almost 45% of the amount spent on buybacks in the first nine months of the year were incurred in the third quarter ($554M).Source: quarterly reportAnd I need to congratulate the management team for doing so. As the average price at which it repurchased shares in Q3 was $38.60, it's pretty clear the company has ramped up its buyback program when Thomson's share price was quite weak. If the buybacks are continuing at this pace, Thomson Reuters will very likely have repurchased 63 million shares (net) in just two years time by the end of this year.Investment thesisBuying back shares is a double-edged sword. Yes, it does increase the per-share financial results, but I'm also a firm believer a company should not be spending more on shareholder rewards than the amount of free cash flow it's generating. Thomson Reuters isn't expensive at all here at $40.50 as that would point in the direction of a free cash flow yield of approximately 6.3%, but it still is a bit too expensive for me considering the company is borrowing cash to fund its share repurchases.Whilst that's not necessarily a 'red flag', it's also possible the market will get 'addicted' to these repurchases and will react negatively when the buyback pace will be reduced. In the previous article, I explained an option strategy (writing put options), and I might implement the same strategy (but using a later expiration date). I currently have no position in Thomson Reuters, but am definitely keeping an eye on this cash cow."

In Thomson Reuters Corp's (NYSE:TRI) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $29 per share, near where it is currently trading. To get the most out of this article, please take a couple minutes to view the following short video here and then come right back.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Thomson Reuters Corp posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its neutral relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. We use Factset Research (NYSE:FDS), Moody's (NYSE:MCO), Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), and McGraw-Hill (MHP) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on Thomson Reuters CorpOur report on Thomson Reuters Corp and hundreds of other companies can be found here. imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsThomson Reuters Corp earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 25.3% during the past three years.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $22, we'd take a closer look.Thomson Reuters Corp has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 14.8% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 31.6%.The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 4.4%. We expect the firm to pay out about 63% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends. However, we're not considering the firm for addition to our Dividend Growth portfolio, as its Dividend Cushion falls below 1.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Thomson Reuters Corp's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 25.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.1%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Thomson Reuters Corp's free cash flow margin has averaged about 13.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Thomson Reuters Corp, cash flow from operations decreased about 19% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 5% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Thomson Reuters Corp's shares are worth between $22.00 - $36.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $29 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about -17.3 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8.2 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 2.8% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 5.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 21%, which is above Thomson Reuters Corp's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 1.4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Thomson Reuters Corp, we use a 9.1% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $29 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Thomson Reuters Corp. We think the firm is attractive below $22 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $36 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Thomson Reuters Corp's fair value at this point in time to be about $29 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Thomson Reuters Corp's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $35 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $29 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The improvement was due to lower financing costs, which fell to $88 million from $266 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings, which exclude non-operating items, came in at $364 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $363 million, or 44 cents a share, in prior year period.Revenues were $3.5 billion, up from $3.4 billion.Analysts expected the company to earn 46 cents a share on revenues of $3.4 billion.Revenues rose 7% in the professional division, thanks to growth across its tax, healthcare, and legal businesses.The company also said today it will sell its Barbri law education business and its Scandinavian tax and accounting business, both of which are expected to close in the first half of 2011. The results of the businesses were included the company’s fourth quarter results.In the markets division, revenues were unchanged as a 6% increase in Enterprise revenues were offset by a 4% decline in investment and advisory revenues.For the full year, the company reported $909 million, or $1.08 a share, in earnings attributable to common shareholders, compared with $844 million, or $1.01 a share, a year ago.Looking to 2011, the company expects revenues to grow in the mid-single digits.

396621,24526,2012-02-28T05:17:26-05:00,,"In this report on Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI), I discuss an extreme valuation opportunity that is somewhat rare. As with most securities selling at excellent valuation levels there are conditions that have created the valuation opportunity. Thomson is no exception.Thomson Reuters is a financial powerhouse headquartered in New York providing services worldwide.Markets are weak, so economic pressure has skewed earnings and revenue growth for Thomson to fall into the 2% range. Management has confirmed that sales are negative thereby signaling a continued challenging environment for strong earnings growth. Current estimates are for 2012 are in the $2.11 area that is only about 13 cents higher than 2011. A recent dividend increase was announced that increased the annual distribution by 3%.The graph below shows the PE ratio and yield of the shares over the past 20 years. Due to charge-offs in 2011, there exists a current negative PE, however, the estimate for 2012 is a PE of 13. The yield is at the highest levels recorded at 4.5%.The dividend has grown steadily with a special dividend in 2008 around the time of the Reuters and Thomson merger. As mentioned, it was recently increased by 3%. The current payout ratio is 60% of free cash flow.Technical Outlook: After a decline in price from $40 a share a year ago, the shares of TRI have been in a bottoming process, which appears to be complete, especially when coupled with its extreme valuation levels.ConclusionThe shares provide a good long-term investment opportunity coupled with a hefty yield of 4.5%. Though current earnings are under pressure, there are changes in place to increase margins and revenues by the end of the year. Though value exists in the shares, especially for those seeking above average yields, near term growth prospects limit substantial capital gains over the next six months or longer. The opportunity exists in the low valuation of the shares, which are only available for investors during conditions that gives one pause. I would buy on pullbacks to the 24-26 levels for those interested in locking in a good price while collecting a decent yield in anticipation of better growth downstream.Disclosure: I am long TRI."

1542012,20991,2013-07-10T10:40:52-04:00,,"Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) (my employer, but I’m not speaking on their behalf here) pays the University of Michigan a seven-figure sum every year. In return, it gets the distribution rights for the university’s closely-followed bi-monthly consumer confidence survey. It’s an arm’s-length commercial transaction: free enterprise in action. But it’s also controversial.Up until now, Thomson Reuters has orchestrated the distribution of the data using a three-tiered system. The top level of high-frequency traders pay a reported $6,000 per month to get the information at 9:54:58am. The next level of Thomson Reuters subscribers, paying substantially less, get the data two seconds later, from a conference call which takes place at 9:55am. Finally, at 10:00am, the report is made freely available on the web.As of this Friday, however, the first tier will be eradicated. You can still pay to get the data five minutes early, but you won’t be able to get the data five minutes and two seconds early. Thomson Reuters didn’t want to make this move — it has said repeatedly, and accurately, that it’s entirely kosher for news and information companies to distribute non-governmental data to fee-paying subscribers. And as Henry Blodget says, Thomson Reuters is hardly alone in this: there’s a massive marketplace out there of information providers charging hedge funds enormous sums for timely access to various datasets.So what’s going on here? The first thing to note is that the only official investigation, here, is being led by Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general. His office is important, because it means he can wield the Martin Act; the SEC can’t do that, and the investigation is not, legally, centered on Reg FD or any kind of insider-trading statute. The Martin Act is an incredibly broadly-written statute dating back to 1921, and allows New York’s attorney general to prosecute just about anybody on Wall Street for just about anything, so long as the behavior in question can be construed to be “contrary to the plain rules of common honesty.” (Quoting the appeals court decision in People v. Federated Radio Corporation, 1926.)The second thing to note is the way that Schneiderman’s investigation is being linked to high-frequency trading: after all, the ability to make money in the space of two seconds is pretty much by definition limited to high-frequency traders. The hedge funds who paid for that two-second head start never bothered to filter the information through a human being: they just got their computers to receive the information directly, and set them loose on the market. Again, that’s entirely legal, although there is something rather dystopian about it as well.Of course if your main target is high-frequency traders, then going after the pre-release of a consumer confidence index is silly: it’s like attacking the use of guns by banning the sale of paper targets. But it makes sense to me that Schneiderman is concentrating just on the two-second window, rather than the five-minute window: while charging human beings for information is a normal and established part of the U.S. economy, there’s something qualitatively different about HFT algobots.What’s more, there’s one big difference between the University of Michigan consumer confidence data, on the one hand, and the valuable proprietary information which is bought and sold every day, on the other: the UMich data is valuable precisely because it is made public, and the act of making it public moves the markets. (Sometimes.) The people who buy early access to the data don’t particularly care about the data itself, and wouldn’t pay nearly as much money for it if it wasn’t about to be made public. What they care about is the market reaction to the data: they want to be able to position themselves, in the market, so as to be able to profit from that reaction.The UMich consumer confidence data in no way qualifies as “inside information” under the SEC definition of the term. But it is market-moving information. And the distinction between the two seems to be slowly being erased. As I wrote last year, there seems to be a general feeling, somewhere in the air, that if a medium-sized group of financial professionals get simultaneous access to potentially market-moving information (the people who subscribe to the 9:55am conference call, for instance, or the people who dial in to Lehman Brothers squawk-box calls), then that’s fine. But if an even smaller group of financial professionals gets the information even earlier, then a line has been crossed.None of this makes much logical sense. But you don’t need a tightly-argued jurisprudential philosophy to bring a Martin Act prosecution; all you need is to convince a court that something is not fair. Call it principle-based regulation, if you must. Under the letter of America’s insider-trading laws, no one did anything wrong here. But put the law to one side; look at the way that the public reacted to the news of what Thomson Reuters was doing. To my eyes, it looked like a diluted version of the reaction to the news of what Henry Blodget was doing at Merrill Lynch, when Eliot Spitzer went on the warpath against him. Grizzled and cynical Wall Street types said, basically, “everybody knew this was happening, what’s the big deal” — but the broader public and news media was genuinely shocked, and that shock was all that Spitzer needed to extract a big settlement.So I think that Thomson Reuters is smart to suspend the top tier of access to the UMich data, at least until Schneiderman finishes his investigation. The two-second window is entirely justifiable on legal grounds — but when you start talking about algobots paying large sums to get a eye-blink head start on market-moving information, potentially making millions of dollars while doing so, then an aggressive New York AG has all he needs to start making lots of hay. It’s probably best to sacrifice the two-second window, at least temporarily, lest Schneiderman start drawing a bead on the five-minute window, next. No one wants him to start getting ideas about the multi-billion-dollar market in financial information more broadly."

An estimated 15% to 20% of the investment banking headcount has already disappeared.Thomson Reuters’ third quarter results showed that Markets revenues beat consensus estimates, suggesting a modest decline in revenues.

The Thomson Corporation is an information content provider play that bodes well for our wired future. Thomson trades on the TSX (Toronto Stock Exchange) and NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) with symbol TOC.
Thomson Corp is an information service provider that has successfully transitioned from a print media-centric company into an electronic media force that is gaining more and more momentum, recently agreeing to buy Reuters, the 156-year-old news service, for about 8.7 billion pounds ($17.9 billion) - talks are still underway.
In addition to a massive newspaper business, Thomson has several other divisions. One of the best is Thomson Legal & Regulatory, which provides information and software-based solutions for legal, tax, accounting, intellectual property, compliance and other business professionals, and government agencies. 
Another division is Thomson Financial, which provides products and integration services to financial and technology professionals in the corporate, investment banking, institutional, retail wealth management and fixed income sectors of the global financial community. 
Lastly, Thomson Scientific & Healthcare provides information and services to researchers, physicians and other professionals in the healthcare, academic, scientific, corporate and government marketplaces.
Just this month, Thomson completed the sale of the higher education, careers and library reference assets of Thomson Learning as well as the sale of Nelson Canada to a consortium of funds. In March 2007, Thomson sold NETg, an electronic education software and delivery platform.
Thomson reported earnings July 26, 2007 that were ahead of expectations, with EBITDA of US$534 million vs. consensus of US$511 million:
The upside came from stronger than expected revenue growth, high margins in the Legal division and lower corporate costs.
Good management, solid economic performance and a strong future for electronic information are all reasons to buy Thomson. There is a strong buy rating consensus among analysts; RBC gives TOC a price target of $51 with above average performance and minimal risk. I consider this a conservative investment inline with my principles of a slow but steady stock that will increase moderately over the next 12 - 18 months.
 If you are looking for a safe but potentially lucrative information-media angle to your portfolio, this might be the right stock for you.

54438,20869,2007-11-15T20:07:32-05:00,,"A Dividends Matter reader  has patiently been waiting on an analysis of Thomson Corporation.
It trades on both the TSE and the NYSE under the symbol (TOC).With its
recent purchase of Reuters Group PLC, a new corporation is formed. This
reduces the historical value of the data as moving forward, this new
company could operate completely differently. So that is one reason why I
have hesitated analyzing this stock.But for Telly’s sake, let’s have a look and see if this stock
deserves a spot in our portfolio of superior dividend yielding stocks.I will work with the Canadian data as I know our reader is Canadian.Company Profile:From Yahoo FinanceMarket capitalization is $26.47B.  For a more complete profile, follow the link to Yahoo Finance.Company Fundamentals:  First of all, let’s look at the fundamentals and see if this is a company worth holding for the next 10 years.Management has consistently delivered a very steady return on
invested capital in the 6.5% range each and every year. The 5 year
average ROIC is 6.6%. Consistency is great as it gives us confidence
that management will be able to continue to deliver this ROIC.The return on equity has been increasing over the last 10 years. The
10 year average ROE is 7.87%. The 5 year average is slightly higher at
8.07%. Not earth shattering numbers, but consistent over the 10 year
period.Equity growth rates have been consistently in the single digits
since 2001 in roughly the 6% range. In fact, the 9 year rate is 7.65%.
The 5 year rate drops to 5.55%. The 3 year rate dips to 4.82%. And last
year’s equity growth rate climbs back up to 6.66%.Earnings per share growth rate has been more erratic. Four separate
years experienced negative growth rates while 2 separate years
experienced rates of 37% and 50% respectively. Over the 10 year period,
the EPS growth rate was 6.77%. The 5 year rate increases to 9.74%. The
3 year rate drops to 3.78%. And last year’s EPS growth rate was an
outstanding 37.25%. Lots of volatility in these growth rates.Sales growth rates have been anemic at best. The 9 year rate is
1.25%. The 5 year rate is -0.06%. Last year’s rate was a dismal -23.69%.Fundamentally, there isn’t much to write home about.  I am not overly excited at the moment about this one.Dividend Fundamentals:The current dividend yield is 2.52%. That is just slightly better
than the S&P/TSX Composite Index dividend yield of 2.43%. So this
would be an average yield in today’s market.The dividend growth rate has historically been on the low side. As
you can see, the 9 year rate is 3.75%. The 5 year rate creeps up to
4.46%. Last year’s rate was an out of character 11.39%. Now, I did
remove the special one time dividend in 2003 as that was part of the
Bell sale. Last year’s dividend increase aside, these are very
disappointing growth rates.And I can see why they have kept the increases low. The dividend
payout ratio is quite high and has been very volatile. In 2006, it sat
at 62.86%. But it seems to have hit as high as 99%!Cash flow growth rates have been almost non-existent. The 9 year
rate is a mere 0.76%. The 5 year rate jumps to 2.51%. But then quickly
comes back to zero with the 3 year rate at -0.82% and last year’s rate
at 0.49%.Valuation Models:Let’s use our 3 models to determine a fair value for this stock.For the average high dividend yield model price, I look at the last
10 years worth of dividend yield data. Interestingly, the 10 year
average high dividend yield is 1.99% and the 5 year average high
dividend yield is 2.02%. That is pretty consistent. At a current
dividend yield of 2.52%, this stock would appear to be on sale. The
model price works out to $51.67. At the current price of $41.30, a
discount of 20.06% current exists!Mr. Benjamin Graham would not agree. The Graham number works out to
$24.96 or a premium of 65.46%. Even using my Modified Graham number of
$28.82, a very large premium exists.Let’s see what the present value model price works out to.  I used the following inputs:With these inputs, the model price works out to a mere $10.01. Of
course, that has to do with the low future EPS growth rate I have
chosen. And because of that low growth rate, there is no way any
investor would put a large P/E on the stock. These 2 numbers go hand in
hand. You will have to determine what you feel is an adequate future
EPS growth rate.Here is my dividend analysis of TOC.Here is the 1 year stock price chart:Not a great year for TOC.Conclusion:So, would I add this stock to our portfolio of superior dividend yielding stocks?  No.First of all, there is a lot of uncertainty with the recent purchase of Reuters.Secondly, I can’t justify the analysts forecast of a future EPS
growth rate of 15% when TOC has consistently delivered equity growth
rates in the 6% range.Too much uncertainty. I am looking for certainty with my dividend
payers. I’ll just look elsewhere for my yield. To the reader: I hope you found the
analysis useful and hopefully your own analysis showed similar
results.Full Disclosure: I do not own shares in TOC."

Drew McReynolds, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said there is “increased confidence” the combined companies will be able to realize a promised US$500-million in cost reductions through data center consolidation and other rationalization.

Tom Glocer, the chief executive of Reuters who will also run the combined companies, said Thursday he does not expect to have to sell any businesses to receive regulatory approval.
Thomson sold its Learning division, which produced text books and electronic information for teachers and students, to help fund the Reuters acquisition.

Receive all our Barron's summaries by signing up here: A Chance to Rewrite the Financial League Tables by Bill Alpert Summary: Thomson's (TOC) recent $18 billion (352.5 pence/0.16 share) offer for rival Reuters (RTRSY) valued Reuters at about 700 pence a share -- a generous 15x cash flow and 25x 2008e earnings. Reuters shares jumped on the news, but only to about 615 pence, reflecting investors uncertainty over the deal getting Reuters approval, and a 5% slide in Thomson shares post-offer. A Reuters insider says that despite Street reservations, its Trust is likely to support the merger, which would produce a worthy Bloomberg competitor -- 60% of the combined company's revenues would come from financial customers. The companies say they can save $500 million post-merger. And the combined company may be able to boost profit margins with enhanced pricing power. Thomson had 8% revenue growth in 2006, but earnings jumped 26% to $860 million, and free cash flow rose 21% to $1.4 billion. Its shares, up 40% since 2002, are way ahead of rival stocks like Dow Jones & Company Inc. (DJ). The company is now addressing apparent flaws in its financial database, and the merger could help it overcome bad press it received since Thomson Financial would be subsumed under the Reuters name. 2008 cash flow forecasts for the companies is $4 billion.

At the start of this week, according to UBS analyst Jeffrey Fan, the spread between the two listings had grown to 20% in the favor of the Corp., according to UBS analyst Jeffrey Fan, up from 15% just a week ago.
Mr. Fan said it's not uncommon for dual-listed companies to trade at a plus/minus of 10%, but added the current spread seems excessive.
He told clients in a note:The analyst said he believes over time the spread will shrink back to the 10% range, but cautioned that, in today's risk averse environment where leverage is limited, there ""may be few marginal buyers to narrow the spread and uncertainties over the outlook for financial markets may mean investors stay cautious on the underlying business.""
The analyst said the Corp.'s premium over PLC is difficult to justify based on its current valuation at 18 times 2009 estimated earnings versus 15 times at the PLC. He added that competitor Reed Elsevier PLC has better earnings visibility and trades at 13 to 14 times 2009 estimated earnings.

34757,20517,2007-05-07T14:25:03-04:00,,"Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWS) on a quest for Dow Jones. Rumors placing Thomson as a potential acquirer of Reuters. What is going on here? 
On first blush, Murdoch's move is a quest for more, high quality content which can be pumped through his global distribution platform. He also has the marketing savvy, development budget and willingness to invest unlike the Bancroft family and Dow Jones. Thomson and Reuters, however, seems like a push for scale and a reach for share, assembling a market data behemoth of a magnitude similar to that of the market leader, Bloomberg. These are seemingly rational and straight-forward reasons for why these deals are in the offing. However, I posit that a much more powerful motivator is at play, and one which can turbocharge the vision and rationale behind these transactions:
With this vision, it isn't simply the creation of ever-fatter pipes that further reinforce the signal/noise problem that is so prevalent in both online and offline media, but the leveraging of sophisticated models to extract valuable metadata, matching this metadata to customer-generated search queries and applying these models across an ever broader array of high-value content. This can also take in consumer-generated data like historical search queries, preferences, tags and consumer-identified relationships among entities and sources. Now this creates value beyond the commodity provision of market data, which is in an inexorable race-to-the-bottom on the basis of latency. This is a hardware and software arms race for which there will be winners and losers, but where there are already well-entrenched players and where the competitive advantage is in better execution models and technology. This is a tough game to play, and certainly not one for which Thomson or Reuters is especially well-positioned.
However, these firms have loads of valuable content just begging to be monetized. Begging to be indexed, organized, and accessible in an efficient, time-sensitive and targeted manner. This, to me, is the magic of a Thomson/Reuters link-up. Not that they will have 34% share in market data versus Bloomberg's 33%, but that their valuable archive of content will be sharply expanded and, hopefully, made available to their terminal subscribers in a smart way, ergo, my ""smart pipe"" metaphor. This is no mean feat either technologically or culturally, let me tell you. These are two siloed, old-line organizations that are trying to move forward quickly in an era of lightning-fast change. And this is hard. But if they get it right, the payoff could be handsome indeed for their investors and customers alike.
But the key to unlocking the ultimate value of this deal is in execution, a significant barrier to success that will require vision, breaking down traditional organizational barriers and taking the long view. If this deal gets done, hopefully they will be able to make it happen. Otherwise, they may go the way of Sony and Howard Stringer. In that case, buyer beware!"

According to a Barron's article by Bill Alpert (buried on page 39), several professors have discovered what they describe as 54,729 non-random, ex-post changes out of 280,463 observations - a little over 19.5% of analyst recs (abstract below): The firms that were the most significant participants in the data backdating were also the firms which had the closest relationship between banking and research and were the hardest hit by the Spitzer enforced settlement. Page four of the academic working paper notes exactly how significant this was: The paper outlines four types of data changes: 1) non-random removal of analyst names from historic recommendations (anonymizations); 2) the addition of new records not previously part of the database; 3) the removal of records that had been in the data; and 4) alterations to historical recommendation levels. The net result of this was to make many specific trading strategies appear better in retrospect than they actually were. Buying top rated stocks and shorting lowest rated stocks, based on the changed data, now perform 15.9% to 42.4% better on the 2004 revised data than on the 2002 tape, the professors state. Further, the profs observe the career paths of many analyst recs: ""Analysts whose track records are affected are associated with more favorable career outcomes over the 2003-2005 period than their track records and abilities would otherwise warrant.""

While this will come as no real surprise -- Reuters had been bandied as a target for some time -- it is still testimony to a rapidly changing business media landscape. While some insiders wrongheadedly think that people are newly finding the real value in the reporting side of the sector, the truth is entirely different.
Data, to quote my friend Tim, is the Intel inside. More than 90% of Reuters revenues come from trading and data, not reporting, and Dow Jones is not dissimilar. The real story here is the rise to supremacy of data, not a sudden whack-on-the-head discovery of the primacy of business & financial reporting.

9880,20140,2006-05-02T07:09:01-04:00,,"Reuters Group Plc (NASD:RTRSY), the huge trading terminal and financial information company, has been in the midst of a turnaround for several years. The results have been mixed.    In 1997, the company posted revenue of $4.747 billion and operating income of $975 million. Revenue continued to rise, but expenses rose faster. In 2001, the top line hit $5.753 billion but operating profit had dropped to $435 million. In 2002, the company had an operating loss of $216 million on revenue of $5.513 billion. Since 2002, the management of Reuters has been pursuing, to some extent, an exercise in cost cutting. Competitors like Bloomberg and Bridge Information Systems mounted vigorous competition for the Reuters trading terminal base, with some success, though Bridge went bankrupt. But the competition took its toll. By last year, revenue had come down to $4.397 billion, however, thanks to cost management, operating income rose to $378 million. Three years ago, Reuters started something called Fast Forward, a restructuring of the company. That program is now close to completion. The hallmarks of the initiative seem to be the sale of non-strategic businesses like Instinet and the lay-offs of a lot of people. The market remains highly competitive, primarily because of Bloomberg. Because it is a private company, it can make investments and financial moves to compete that a public company like Reuters would find more difficult. If Bloomberg wants to start a new product line that involves large capital outlays, it does not have to be concerned with shareholder reaction. Since Fast Forward is in its late stages, it is safe to assume that most of what Reuters thinks can be done on a restructuring basis is now over. Reuters recently announced Q1 06 revenue of $1.13 billion. What the company calls ""underlying revenue"" -- which is mostly the trading screen business and is adjusted for currency changes -- grew 4%. According to the Associated Press, Reuters now claims 27% of the global financial information screen market, the same level as Bloomberg. Reuters is now enjoying a positive environment, as the financial markets are doing well. Trading terminal sales tend to be hurt by poor markets as financial institutions cut costs and personnel. The company's share price is now at $42.48, against a 52-week high of $48.74 and a low of $37.10. With the restructuring largely behind the company, and very little growth on the horizon, there is no reason to believe that the stock is likely to make a run. RTRSY 1-yr chart:  Douglas A.

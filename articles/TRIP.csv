While TripAdvisor has seen a big fall from the high of $32 before March, the stock has been making a slow but steady recovery.Source: investing.comOne of the biggest misconceptions surrounding the future of the travel industry is the idea that demand will continue to remain low until COVID-19 has been eradicated.In fact, staycation demand has seen a surge since the outbreak of the pandemic. Taking the United Kingdom as just one example, the country saw a 45% week-on-week increase for domestic hotel bookings - with this figure up by 140% for London and as high as 300% for Manchester.TripAdvisor also notes continuing upward trend for domestic travel demand:Source: TripAdvisor 2Q20 Investor PresentationIn this regard, TripAdvisor has continued to serve as an important resource for reviews pertaining to hotels along with other aspects of travel - the focus has simply shifted domestically rather than internationally.According to the company's Q2 2020 Investor Presentation - the company has seen a rebound in its website usage to 67% in July as compared to the same period last year.Source: TripAdvisor 2Q20 Investor PresentationFurthermore, in spite of the pressures posed by COVID-19, the company has still maintained a strong liquidity position - with $698 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of June:Source: TripAdvisor 2Q20 Investor PresentationIt is also notable that 86% of travellers will reportedly not book an attraction without having read reviews previously. Such demand will also continue to apply to the domestic market, and TripAdvisor's role as a leading reviews provider shows no signs of abating.Looking more at the financials for this company, I had remarked in a previous article that with the stock trading at a lower price to free cash flow ratio than previously - the stock had become increasingly attractive on a free cash flow basis.Even with commendable liquidity management on the company's part - overall travel has still seen a strong drop and therefore the company is indicated as overvalued on a price to free cash flow basis.Source: YChartsOn an earnings basis, the overvaluation in terms of EV/EBITDA is even more striking, with this ratio trading far above the 5-year average trend:Source: YChartsFrom this point of view, I do not see TripAdvisor as a buy - yet.With air travel now expected to reach pre-pandemic levels once again by 2022, we can expect a steady rise in interest for global travel. Ultimately, this will be necessary for TripAdvisor's business - as domestic travel interest alone can only help the company recover so much.However, the article by Climate Home News makes quite an interesting point. While domestic flights represent a small proportion of all flights in and out of Europe - over two-thirds of all aircraft emissions from the U.S. and China come from domestic flights. Notwithstanding a growing sentiment on the part of some airline customers to travel less and reduce their carbon footprint - it is clear that domestic travel is a big market in the U.S. and China, and we can expect a resurgence in travel in those two countries to account for a large share of the resurgence in travel demand overall.Additionally, TripAdvisor had been seeing solid growth in net income and EBITDA before the pandemic - so there has clearly been demand for the company's offering before COVID-19.Source: TripAdvisor 2Q20 Investor PresentationNonetheless, it is important to remain realistic and recognise that TripAdvisor has taken a big hit in terms of their financials. We can see that revenue is down by over 80% across all segments, and the company reported a significant earnings loss on a per share basis:Source: TripAdvisor Second Quarter 2020 Financial ResultsWhen taking a look at the company's balance sheet, we can see that while total assets have risen as a result of a rise in cash and cash equivalents (or company assets that can be immediately converted to cash), we can see that total liabilities have also seen a sharp increase due to a spike in long-term debt:Source: TripAdvisor Second Quarter 2020 Financial ResultsFrom this standpoint, it appears that while the company has been able to conserve cash during this crisis, it has also been necessary to avail of long-term debt in order to keep operations running.TripAdvisor is still quite overvalued at this point, but travel demand is increasingly showing signs of life once again. I take the view that TripAdvisor is managing its cash flow prudently and the company still has a strong business model. However, this is still a company that is now operating with more debt and is trading at a significant loss. For this reason, I anticipate that it will take until at least 2022 (when air travel demand is estimated to recover) until we see the stock become attractive once again on an earnings basis.Additional disclosure: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

The company has enough liquidity to stay afloat and it recently started to implement several cash preservation measures, which will help it to save around $200 million in expenses this year. At the same time, the expansion of the E&G (experiences and dining) business will help TripAdvisor to create shareholder value in the long run. While COVID-19 will act as the biggest threat to my bullish thesis, TripAdvisor will be able to leverage its media assets to offset some of the losses that were caused by the pandemic and secure a lasting future. Considering this, I continue to hold a long position in the company.In the second quarter of the year, TripAdvisor's revenues decreased by 86% year-over-year to $59 million, while its EBITDA was -$74 million and its non-GAAP EPS was -$0.76. Despite the decline, the company's stock has been climbing in recent days and has already appreciated by more than 20% since the initial publication of my article on TripAdvisor back in July.The major problem of TripAdvisor in the past was the inability of the business to find its edge in the online travel industry. The management has been constantly redefining TripAdvisor's business model. At one time, TripAdvisor wanted to become a major OTA service and compete directly with Booking (BKNG) and Expedia (EXPE), while at the other time it decided to pivot to metasearch business and run ads for both of those services. Without a clear direction, the company's stock has been depreciating for the last six years and only three years ago the management finally figured out what kind of business TripAdvisor should be. By pivoting to the E&G business in 2017, TripAdvisor was able to offset some of the declines of the metasearch business and now E&G accounts for more than a quarter of the company's revenues. Currently, TripAdvisor makes a portion of its revenues from commissions that restaurants and trip providers pay for each booking and reservation that is made on TripAdvisor's platform. From 2017 to 2019 revenues of the E&G business were increasing at the compounded annual growth rate of 31% and were expected to grow even more in 2020 if it were not for the pandemic. However, the growth of the E&G business in the past three years helped TripAdvisor to get more than 460 million MAUs and create one of the biggest online libraries on travel-related content about restaurants, experiences, hotels, airlines, etc., in the world. With so much content and such a high user base, TripAdvisor finally starts to leverage its media assets and is about to start creating shareholder value once again.According to TripAdvisor's latest presentation, the company influences $546 billion of travel expenses and more than 400 million trips each year and acts as a global travel guidance business. By having a global niche audience, TripAdvisor is able to generate leads for travel-related businesses by acting as a media influencer and receive a hefty commission for its services. As the online global travel market is about to account for the majority of travel revenues, TripAdvisor, which is also the largest travel website around the globe, will be able to leverage its media assets and drive growth in the post-pandemic world.Source: TripAdvisorCurrently, TripAdvisor works on a couple of its own direct to consumer offerings. In its latest conference call, the management said that the company along with its partners is going to offer paid insurance products that will be sold on the platform and will be covering the whole trip of its customers. The offering is in the early stages, so we need to wait and see how things play out. The second offering involves customizable trips. Recently, TripAdvisor launched Reco, which connects travelers and trip planners with each other. By using the service, trip planners can customize a complete trip for travelers, who don't want to plan trips themselves and only know which location they want to visit. TripAdvisor is able to make money by charging a matchmaking fee. Reco is currently in its early stages, so it's too soon to tell whether the service will be successful. However, one certain thing is that TripAdvisor has finally started to leverage its media assets and is moving in the right direction.There are a couple of major risks, which are associated with TripAdvisor. COVID-19 will continue to be the biggest threat for TripAdvisor, and as its advertisers, which are mostly businesses from the travel industry, go bankrupt or hoard cash to stay alive, the company's advertising business will continue to decline. TripAdvisor even received a downgrade a few months ago from a major risk due to its reliance on advertising revenues. Another threat comes from Google (GOOG)(GOOGL), which has launched Google Travel service a while ago and now has the capability to take some portion of TripAdvisor's traffic to its own platform. As a result, investors should expect TripAdvisor's revenues to continue to decline even in a post-pandemic world. However, TripAdvisor has enough room to continue to expand its E&G business and leverage its media assets, which will eventually offset the advertising losses.By having $698 million in cash reserves at the end of Q2, TripAdvisor will be able to survive the pandemic. To preserve cash, the executive team decided to cut its compensation and bonuses this year and at the same time cut a portion of its workforce, which should lead to an annual saving of $200 million in 2020. While the company had $725 million in debt at the end of June, in managed to issue $500 million worth of convertible notes at 7% in July and is not going to run out of money. As those notes will mature only in 2025, TripAdvisor has enough time to weather the current crisis and wait for the travel industry to recover to its pre-COVID-19 levels.While it will take years for the whole industry to return to normalcy, the online traffic already has started to recover. In April, May, and June, TripAdvisor's MAUs were down 67%, 55%, and 40% Y/Y, respectively. In July, MAUs were down only 33% Y/Y and this sequential growth should continue at least until the end of the year.Considering how damaged the whole travel sector is, I'm still confident in TripAdvisor's ability to create value, as it has enough resources to stay alive and it will be able to leverage its media assets to drive growth in the post-pandemic world. For that reason, I continue to hold a long position in TripAdvisor."
4350557,69905,2020-05-28T11:58:27-04:00,Short video discussing TripAdvisor's and its valuation.TripAdvisor was already losing relevancy before COVID.It's difficult to make the argument that TripAdivsor is undervalued at present.,"TripAdvisor (TRIP) continues its fall from grace. I fail to see how investors are able to make a bullish thesis here. And that the stock is more likely than not overvalued, despite continuing to trade near multiple-year lows.Asides from its valuation (I'll address this lower down), it is difficult to get excited about TripAdvisor's potential. It is a company that has been losing relevancy for a considerable amount of time, and COVID is just another headwind to navigate.Indeed, whenever one reads through an earnings call and sees management's primary focus is on playing defense and cutting back expenses you already know your investment is in trouble.Put another way, if management waits until things are very grim to start thinking about becoming efficient with its operations, you see that its probably not the best-managed operation.Specifically, since 2017, TripAdvisor's revenues have been largely flat. Thus, its troubles have been in place way before COVID. Furthermore, going into Q3 this year, TripAdvisor is cutting back expenses by 40% compared with the start of the year. Furthermore, it has negotiated a leverage covenant break until Q3 of 2021. None of these point to a company that is becoming more relevant over time - quite the opposite, it appears a company that is struggling for survival.We can see that over its Q1 2020 period, TripAdvisor drew dawn $700 million of debt while at the same time deploying $175 million towards share repurchases. This is astounding.Consider this, back in December 2019, even though TripAdvisor had its problems, at least it could claim to have a rock-solid balance sheet, with a net cash position of more than $315 million. Fast forward 90 days, and it's left with a balance sheet with under $100 million of net cash. But more importantly, it now has a whopping $700 million of debt. Surely, even without the benefit of hindsight, TripAdvisor should have been more prudent with its capital?Perhaps I'm being too pessimistic and all the above and more are already priced into its share price? I do not believe this to be the case. Realistically, I've been following this company from the sidelines and been wanting until its valuation affords me enough margin of safety to warrant my investment.But whilst it supports a $2.5 billion market cap valuation, it is difficult to build a bullish thesis here.The video shows that I find it very difficult to build a bullish thesis here."
4357451,101963,2020-07-08T06:41:54-04:00,"After depreciating nearly 80% in the last 5 years, TripAdvisor’s stock seems to have hit the bottom and has all the chances to appreciate in the near future.With 463 million MAUs and one of the largest libraries of travel-related content on the web, TripAdvisor will continue to be an important player in the online travel industry.By having a positive net cash position and attractive growth prospects, TripAdvisor will be able to create value in the foreseeable future, as travel rebounds.","After depreciating nearly 80% in the last 5 years, TripAdvisor’s (TRIP) stock seems to have hit the bottom and has all the chances to appreciate in the near future, as there’s an indication that the travel industry slowly starts to recover. While in the past TripAdvisor failed to unlock value despite being one of the most popular travel websites on Earth, it has been able to constantly generate a positive FCF and its current cash reserves outweigh the company’s total debt. At the same time, with more than 460 million monthly active users, TripAdvisor could be viewed as a potential takeover target by major OTAs and tech companies, which have plans to establish a stronger presence in the online travel niche. Even though the company will be unprofitable this year due to the pandemic, the analysts estimate that TripAdvisor will return to profitability in 2021. Considering that the stock trades close to its all-time low, I decided to purchase the company’s shares, as I believe that the recovery of travel and the potential acquisition in the future will drive TripAdvisor’s stock higher in months to come.The spread of COVID-19 all around the globe disrupted TripAdvisor’s business. As a company that heavily relies on the growth of the tourism industry, TripAdvisor suffered immense losses in the first half of the year. Over the years, the company’s earnings were fluctuating from time to time as a result of poor governance, but in the first three months of the current year, it had probably the worst performance in its history. In Q1, TripAdvisor’s revenues declined by 26.1% Y/Y to $278 million, while profit during the period fell by 161% Y/Y to a net loss of $16 million.However, TripAdvisor is not the only company among its peers that showed a poor performance due to the pandemic. The table below shows that lots of companies had similar results and are not profitable anymore. Only Booking (BKNG) along with TripAdvisor has been profitable on a TTM basis and has a positive P/E ratio. With EV/EBITDA of 9.19x, TripAdvisor could be considered undervalued compared to its peers, as the industry’s median EV/EBITDA is 11.58x. However, considering the uncertain environment in which all the companies from the table operate, a simple comparable analysis is not enough to decide whether it is worth purchasing TripAdvisor shares or not.Source: Yahoo Finance. The table was created by the authorOnline travel is a very competitive niche. Over the years, two major OTAs, Expedia (EXPE) and Booking, have been establishing a greater presence in the industry by acquiring travel-related platforms and services and adding more users to their ecosystems. Currently, both of them form a duopoly in the OTA field, which benefits both companies. As one of the biggest travel websites in the world, TripAdvisor remains one of the major sources of traffic for those companies. However, the spread of COVID-19 forced them to cut their advertising budgets and preserve as much cash as possible to survive the current crisis. Since the whole travel industry is in disarray right now, TripAdvisor is expected to lose a substantial amount of money this year, as its advertising revenues will decline in 2020. In May, Deutsche Bank (DB) downgraded TripAdvisor due to its high reliance on other companies that use its platform for advertising.The good news is that TripAdvisor is more than just an advertising and reservation platform. TripAdvisor is first and foremost a community-based platform with social media and online search features, which helps its users to find everything they want about travel. With nearly a billion of reviews and opinions and more than 460 million average monthly users, TripAdvisor can leverage its platform by offering different experiences to travelers. In the last 3 years, the experiences and dining (E&D) business was growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 31% and it currently accounts for 29% of the overall revenues, an increase from 17% in 2017. By pivoting to E&D, TripAdvisor was able to diversify its sources of income and offset some of the declines from its advertising business.Source: TripAdvisorWhile the pandemic will also hurt the E&D business this year, TripAdvisor has enough liquidity to weather the current storm. At the end of Q1, TripAdvisor had $798 million in cash reserves and the ability to draw an additional $300 million from its credit facility. Its total debt is $725 million. At the same time, on Tuesday, the company announced the launch of a $500 million debt offering, which will help it to survive the pandemic. Since TripAdvisor expects to return to profitability in a few quarters, I believe that the stock has finally hit the bottom and all the downside is already priced in.Two weeks ago, the company said that it has seen a 38% increase of unique users in May in comparison to April. It expects the number of users to rise even more in June in comparison to May, as there’s an indication that the industry starts to recover from the pandemic. Companies like Airbnb (AIRB) and Booking also said that they’ve seen an improvement in bookings in the last couple of months. All of this suggests that TripAdvisor will indeed be able to return to profitability sooner rather than later and its stock is a solid rebound play from the travel industry.The major risk that TripAdvisor currently faces is the increased competition from Google (GOOG)(GOOGL). After Google launched Google Travel in 2019 and started to offer affordable deals for hotel rooms and air tickets for travelers, TripAdvisor’s metasearch business declined by 4% Y/Y in the same year. While the metasearch business is expected to decline even more in the next few quarters, since TripAdvisor is now in a confrontation with Google, the company still will be able to create value. By having nearly half a billion active monthly users along with one of the largest libraries of travel-related content on its platform, TripAdvisor will continue to be an important player in travel. Its decision to expand its E&D business in 2017 already yields positive results and will help the company to offset some of the losses from other businesses.At the same time, TripAdvisor could become a takeover target for Google or other OTAs, which want to establish a better presence in the online travel niche. With more than $110 billion in cash reserves, Google will have no problem purchasing TripAdvisor, which has an overall market cap of less than $3 billion, if it decides to expand the Google Travel platform and increase its market share in online travel.With all of this in mind, I believe that TripAdvisor is a solid company to own. By having a positive net cash position and attractive growth prospects, it will be able to create value in the foreseeable future, as travel rebounds."
4349304,104099,2020-05-21T11:49:40-04:00,"I think TripAdvisor will survive the current crisis, given the firm's strong liquidity position. In addition, an insider and a talented institutional investor have recently bought shares.In spite of this strong bullish signal, I think the shares remain overpriced.That said, we're close enough to a reasonable buy price that the options market offers investors a potentially profitable alternative.","Shares of TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP) are down about 43% since I wrote my cautious note on the company a little over two years ago, against a gain of about 5% for the S&P 500. I think a stock that's trading at $18.50 represents a fundamentally different risk profile than one that's trading at $36, so I thought I'd check in on the name. I like companies that are generally out of favor, so TripAdvisor may have some long-term potential. I'll try to answer whether it's a good buy at the moment by looking at the financial history here, and by looking at the stock itself as a thing distinct from the business. I'll also write about insider and institutional activity, as I think these may give investors a clue about the future. For those who can stand neither the suspense, nor my writing, I'll jump immediately to the point. I think TripAdvisor is very well positioned to survive this (hopefully) short-term crisis, but the shares are still too rich for my blood. Thankfully, the options market provides an alternative to simply buying at the current level.The company is obviously facing headwinds because global travel has basically been turned off, and there are questions about whether it will ever return to what it was pre-COVID-19. I think the company summarized its current predicament very well in their latest 10-Q.SourceThat said, we investors must have some faith that the world will return to something like normal, or else we'd be buying arable land and seeds and not stocks. Given that we have faith in a return to normal, and given that we're told to ""buy low"", and given that we can only ever ""buy low"" when everyone else is terrified, TripAdvisor may be a great long-term investment at current prices.The financial history here is interesting in that revenue and net income have moved in opposite directions from each other over time. Specifically, over the past eight years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 9.3%, while net income has declined at a CAGR of about 5.25%. Whenever I come upon a company where the more they sell, the more they lose, I'm prompted to ask ""if growing sales doesn't lead to increased profits, what does?!""Comparing the most recent quarter to the same period a year ago reveals the beginning of the impact of the coronavirus on this company. Revenues were down massively (26%), and net income has fallen off a cliff, down 161% from the same time a year ago.On the bright side, the company has more than enough liquidity to weather the current storm in my estimation. They have drawn $700 million of their $1 billion credit facility, which is due in May of 2022. Against this, they have $798 million of cash. I would rate this as one of the most rock solid balance sheets I've come upon recently.The Problem With BuybacksMy regular readers know that I've recently grown quite skeptical about the value of buybacks. I've spoken to many investment professionals over the years who have characterized buybacks as an unalloyed good, and they're wrong. Buybacks can be shareholder friendly, but they're certainly not always. TripAdvisor is another great example of how buybacks can destroy shareholder wealth.For your enjoyment and edification, I've created a table that walks through the specifics of TripAdvisor's buyback activity over the past several years. Per this analysis, over the past 7 ¼ years, the company has spent approximately $730 million to retire just over 8.7 million shares. This works out to a price per share of ~$83.77. So, management spent $730 million of shareholders wealth to buy back shares at a price about $64 per share higher than the current market price. Had the share count been kept constant in 2013, and that $730 million was delivered to shareholders in the form of a dividend, they would have received just over $5.60 per share. I think I can speak for every investor when I write that given a choice, they would have preferred receiving their returns in the form of $5.60 in dividend payments.Source: Company 10-Ks, Author CalculationsSource: Company FilingsAlthough I don't like the fact that the company has spent an enormous sum overpaying for stock over the past several years, that's really a problem for shareholders and not potential shareholders. I think the financial history here suggests that, although margins are shrinking, this is a consistently profitable business that is well positioned to weather the current storm. Thus, I think there's very little risk of bankruptcy at this point. For that reason, I think it's still worth considering an investment here. In order to do that, I need to spend some time writing about the stock as a thing distinct from the business itself. The reason for this is that I think a great company can be a terrible investment if you overpay, and a troubled company can be a great business if you buy it at a bargain.I determine whether a company is a bargain or not in a host of ways. Most simply, I look at the ratio of price to some measure of economic value like earnings, free cash flow, and the like. In my previous article I ""went on about"" the fact that shares were trading at a price to free cash flow of about 27 times. In spite of the fact that shares have dropped dramatically in price, the shares are actually more expensive on a price to free cash flow basis, per the following:Data by YChartsIn addition to looking at a simple ratio of price to some measure of economic value, I want to try to understand what the market is assuming about long-term growth here. In order to do that, I employ the methodology described by Professor Stephen Penman in his book ""Accounting for Value."" In this book, Penman walks an investor through how they can isolate the ""g"" (growth) variable in a standard finance formula. This gives a sense of what the market assumes about future growth. In my previous article, I complained that according to this methodology, the market was forecasting a perpetual growth rate of about 10%. Applying this methodology to the current price suggests the market is assuming a growth rate of about 8% here, which is obviously less optimistic (i.e. 'better') than before, but is still quite sanguine in my view. For these reasons, I can't recommend buying the shares at current levels.Just because I think the shares don't currently represent good value doesn't mean other, more knowledgeable investors agree with me. I've written many, many times that not all investors are created equal. Some people are better at investing than the rest of us because they have the perfect intellectual and emotional temperament for this activity. Some people are better because they have a team of analysts at their disposal. Some people tend to be better at buying and selling a specific stock because they work at the company represented and thus know more about it than any Wall Street analyst ever will. I think it makes sense to at least be aware of the market maneuvers of such investors, as there's a chance that we might ride their collective coattails.With that in mind, I should point out that on March 5 of this year, Stephen Kaufer spent just under $966,000 of his own money to acquire 44,444 shares at an average price of $21.73. I think when someone as knowledgeable as this person puts their own capital to work, the rest of us should at least take note.In addition, filings indicate that by the end of March, none other than the great Joel Greenblatt purchased an additional 103,384 shares, bringing his total exposure to the firm to 176,854 shares.In my view, when investors like Greenblatt, and insiders like Kaufer put capital to work in the company, we should be made aware of it. I think the fact that these two have put capital to work indicates that there's some value here.Just because I don't think there's great value at current prices doesn't mean I don't think there's value here. I would be very happy to buy this company at the right price. This puts me on the horns of a dilemma. On the one hand, I can wait for the shares to drop to a more reasonable level. There are two problems with this approach as far as I can tell. First, the shares may never drop to a level that I consider acceptable. Second, waiting in this way is very, very boring.Thankfully, the options market provides investors with the opportunity to generate an immediate credit by selling the right to sell the shares to us at a price we consider acceptable. In this way, I consider short puts a win-win trade. If the shares remain above the strike price, the investor simply pockets the premium. If the shares drop, the investor will be obliged to buy, but will do so at a price that they think represents a great long-term buy price.At the moment, my preferred short put is the December 2020 with a strike of $12. These are currently bid-asked at $1.15-$1.35. So if the investor simply takes the market here, and the shares remain above $12 for the next seven months, the investor takes the premium. If the shares drop below $12, the investor will be obliged to buy at a net price of ~$10.85. I think $10.85 represents a great long-term entry price. Note that $10.85 is about 44% below the current market price. Holding all else constant, that would represent a price to free cash flow of about 17.5 times, which is much more reasonable in my view.Hopefully I've gotten you quite excited about the possibilities of writing put options, dear reader, because now I get to splash cold water all over the idea. Investing, like life itself is risky and involves making choices among a host of imperfect trade-offs. There is no risk-free option. There's risk A, and there's risk B. We do our best to navigate the world by exchanging one pair of risk-reward trade-offs for another. For example, holding cash presents the risk of erosion of purchasing power via inflation and the reward of preserving capital at times of extreme volatility. Buying stock has a host of risk-reward trade-offs that should be very obvious to any investor in early 2020.I think the risks of put options are very similar to those associated with a long stock position. If the shares drop in price, the stockholder loses money and the short put writer may be obliged to buy the stock. Thus, both long stock and short put investors typically want to see higher stock prices.Puts are distinct from stocks in that some put writers don't want to actually buy the stock; they simply want to collect premia. Such investors care more about maximizing their income and will, therefore, be less discriminating about which stock they sell puts on. These people don't want to own the underlying security. For my part, I'm too much of a coward to sell puts on anything other than companies I'm willing to buy at prices I'm willing to pay. For that reason, being exercised isn't the trauma for me that is for many other put writers. If you are considering this strategy for yourself, you should think hard about whether you are in it to collect premia or whether you want to sell puts on companies you'd be happy to own.In my view, put writers take on risk, but they take on less risk (sometimes significantly less risk) than stock buyers in a critical way. Short put writers generate income simply for taking on the obligation to buy a business that they like at a price that they find attractive. This circumstance is objectively better than simply taking the prevailing market price. This is why I consider the risks of selling puts on a given day to be far lower than the risks associated with simply buying the stock on that day.Since I've never passed up the opportunity to belabor a point, allow me to drill this into your head even further using TripAdvisor as an example. The investor can choose to buy the shares today at a price of ~$19.00. Alternatively, they can generate a credit for their accounts by selling put options that oblige them - under the worst possible circumstance - to buy the shares at a net price ~45% below today's level. In my view, that is the definition of lower risk.I think TripAdvisor will eventually recover, and will return to something like normal over the next few years. In the meantime, the company has more than sufficient liquidity to survive. I also like the fact that both people who know the business well, and investors like Greenblatt have purchased recently. The problem is that I still consider the shares to be expensive. They're certainly not as dear as they were over two years ago, but they remain too rich for me. Thankfully, the options market provides an alternative to simply buying at the current price. In spite of the risks inherent in the short put trade, I think it makes most sense at the moment. The trade is a ""win-win"" in my estimation, and so I will be executing it this week. I suggest other potential shareholders here do the same."

The company was a cash-flow machine before the virus outbreak as the largest travel platform in the world with 463 million monthly users. The coronavirus crisis caused a near elimination of vacation travel, but the company is now poised for the rebound in travel and isn't as reliant on air travel that is still down nearly 90% from 2019 levels. The stock has already rebounded off the lows, but TripAdvisor might have potential upside as the bottom line improves coming out of the shutdown with a more efficient operation going forward.On the Q1 earnings call, TripAdvisor made some interesting comments about coming back from the virus stronger than in the past. The company laid off 900 employees, or nearly 25% of the workforce, with no intention of rehiring those employees when business rebounds. Another 850 employees were furloughed with the intent of recalling those employees probably sooner rather than later.Revenues were down 90% at one point in March, but business should be rebounding now. Air travel is already rebounding from a low below 5% of 2019 levels. In addition, most consumers are likely to drive for a vacation this summer which benefits TripAdvisor either way.TripAdvisor forecasts a $65 million reduction in Q3 fixed operating costs while variable costs like performance marketing expenses and cost of goods sold will dip with revenues. Last Q3, the travel platform had $428 million in revenues and around $300 million in cash costs.Source: TripAdvisor Q3'19 earnings releaseTripAdvisor reported operating income of $68 million in Q3'19, but once adding back amortization costs of $9 million and stock-based compensation expenses of $29 million, the company generated $106 million in adjusted operating income. TripAdvisor had $129 million in adjusted EBITDA when adding back depreciation charges.The $65 million reduction in fixed costs eliminates 20% of total costs from last year. The big question is whether TripAdvisor can return to the same revenue levels with a nearly 25% reduction in workers for a company previously generating adjusted EBITDA margins of 30%.The upside to the stock could be substantial with this much fixed costs removed from the operations.Based on recent momentum with the virus and economic reopening of most states, revenues should rebound faster than expected. The company provided this handy chart of how travel trends have always headed higher despite plenty of past virus concerns.Source: TripAdvisor Q1'20 presentationThe latest data from the CDC is starting to confirm the COVID-19 deaths were only pulling forward deaths for terminally ill patients while the shutdown economy caused a reduction in non-flu like deaths. Through the week of May 23, the CDC shows that deaths for the year at 933K were actually lower than expected level at only 99%.Source: CDCA few weeks of excess deaths don't adjust the whole picture significantly. The case for travelers to stay home just can't be made when the virus isn't causing an abnormal level of deaths in the U.S. despite claims of 100K deaths from COVID-19.For TripAdvisor, the company ended March with $798 million in cash after taking down a $700 million revolver. The travel platform estimated the cash would provide the liquidity for up to 2 years of sustained travel weakness.The stock recently held strong support near $15. Anybody buying here at $23 missed the lows, but TripAdvisor appears set to make a run at previous highs with the reduced cost structure.The key investor takeaway is that TripAdvisor is poised to continue rallying. The company has the potential of coming back more profitable despite previously generating large EBITDA margins. The stock is a definite buy on weakness following any failure to break the downtrend near $25."
4358849,62863,2020-07-16T12:47:09-04:00,"I have been tracking upwards of forty companies directly and negatively impacted by coronavirus. TripAdvisor is on that list.For optimistic investors (or traders) looking to bet on a vaccine or the world narrowly avoiding a second wave shutdown, TripAdvisor could be a better bet than other sectors.The company owns a great franchise, is rapidly reducing its variable costs, and, relatively speaking, has a strong balance sheet compared to airlines and cruise lines.","Since April 2020, I have been tracking about forty stocks that have been directly and negatively impacted by coronavirus. On that list are airlines, cruise ships, casinos, hotels, and restaurants. TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is also a stock on that list. With Tuesday night's news that Moderna's (MRNA) phase 1 initial trial is going swimmingly, I figure it might be a good time to discuss TripAdvisor. If you are optimistic on a vaccine, and you are looking for a way to bet on life starting to return to normalcy, albeit eventually, you might want to consider shares of TripAdvisor. At the outset of the crisis, TRIP had the advantage of a strong balance sheet, access to credit, and a business model where many variable expenses could be quickly curtailed, thus mitigating some of the major cash burn during the pandemic whereas more capital-intensive industries, like airlines and cruise ships, will burn billions of dollars despite their best efforts.Generally speaking, when I write up a new idea, I try to follow a basic framework.Instead of reinventing the wheel or trying to paraphrase, enclosed below is how TripAdvisor describes its business.Per the Company's 10-K:TRIP has the following two reportable segments: (1) Hotels, Media & Platform and (2) Experiences & Dining.In this section, I am sharing the most relevant descriptions of these two segments as this is a lengthy piece of its annual report.TripAdvisor-branded Hotels Revenue: Revenue is generated from click-based advertising on TripAdvisor-branded websites. The end customers are 'Online Travel Agencies', referred to as (OTAs) and direct owners of hotel room capacity. Click-based advertising is priced on a cost per click ('CPC') basis. So, number of clicks x the CPC rate equals your revenue. CPC rates are determined by competitive auction (or metasearch auction), where travel partners bid CPC. Alternatively, TRIP sells subscription-based advertising to hotels, B&B operators, and owners of specialty destinations.TripAdvisor-branded Display and Platform Revenue. Per the 10-K,Experiences: TripAdvisor provides information and services that enable customers to research and book activities while on vacation (or traveling) through its site (Viator), and TripAdvisor's website and mobile app. Also, TRIP partners with affiliates that offer experiences. The company earns for commission for each booking.Dining: TRIP provides information and services for consumers to research and book restaurants through its dedicated site - TheFork as well as (including www.thefork.com, www.lafourchette.com, www.eltenedor.com, www.restorando.com and www.bookatable.co.uk).In Hotels, Media & Platform: TRIP competes with:In the Experiences and Dining segment:Trajectory of Revenue and Adjusted EBITDATRIP's revenues have been relatively flat over the past three full years, so its stock price has gotten dinged, as Wall Street loves growth. When TRIP's top line was growing, its stock hit an all-time high of $110 per share back in June 2014. As a value investor, I like to look for stocks at least 80% from their all-time highs.Source: Yahoo FinanceAs you can see, TRIP's top line has been stagnant from FY 2017 to FY 2019. Note how 'selling and marketing' expenses made up 43% of FY 2019 revenue.The Breakout of Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by segmentAs you can clearly see, the lion's share of TRIP's Adjusted EBITDA is from its Hotels, Media & Platform segment.Source: TripAdvisor Q1 FY 2020 Earning Presentation (May 8, 2020)TRIP has a massive addressable market and lots of market share to capture if they can execute well in a fragmented and highly competitive sector.This slide suggests that TRIP's revenue to overall worldwide travel spend is less than 1% in 2019.This slide show TRIP's massive monthly unique visitor count and how the company needs to do a better job monetize some of that traffic.Let's start with sentiment:Despite massive cash burn rates for airlines, cruise lines, and to a somewhat less extent (Hotels and Casinos), from June 1, 2020, to June 8, 2020, the stocks of these sectors had a massive short covering and momentum induced rally. Ironically, however, these operating losses have resulted in many of these companies forced to issue expensive debt and in some cases, with bond coupon rates in the low double-digit debt. However, since the remarkable trading gains that ended on June 8th, these stocks are well off their highs as gravity and poor fundamentals seem to overshadow the allure of exciting trading vehicles.AirlinesSource: Yahoo Finance Cruise LinesSource: Yahoo FinanceSource: Yahoo FinanceSource: Yahoo FinanceDuring the fierce rally for airlines, hotels, casinos, and cruise lines, it proved fleeting in most cases, unless you were a disciplined trader. I would argue that TripAdvisor is trading like a lower beta stock and never really attracted the attention of traders despite its strong business correlation to travel.Source: Yahoo FinanceIronically, TRIP doesn't have nearly the cash burn rate issues as, say, an airline, cruise line, casino, or hotel because they don't operate as capital-intensive businesses that require high load factors, and its balance sheet is in excellent shape, at least compared to that peer group.Moreover, unlike those capital-intensive businesses, TRIP can rapidly dial down many of its variable costs, like their advertising.On the May 8, 2020, Q1 FY 2020 Conference Call:Check out some of the opening remarks:Secondly, look at this analyst Q & A exchange:TRIP has 121.4 million Class A shares and 12.8 million Class B shares. So, 134.2 x $20.57 = $2.76 billion market capitalization. And the company has $800 million of cash, as they drew $700 million on their revolver during Q1 FY 2020, so we are looking at an enterprise value of $2.63 billion.In an attempt to bolster its balance sheet fuller, on July 7, 2020, TRIP announced launching a $500 million private placement debt deal with a targeted maturity date of 2025. Final details haven't been publicly announced.In FY 2019, TRIP generated $438 million of Adjusted EBITDA.So, we are talking about a multiple of 6.07X EV/ FY 2019 Adjusted EBITDA.No question TRIP won't make much Adjusted EBITDA in FY 2020, but we need to think about normalized EBITDA power as equity investors, especially given how strong TRIP's balance sheet is, relate to investors' favorite trading vehicles (airlines, casino, cruise lines, and hotels).If you are optimistic that we can avoid a second wave or that a vaccine will be successful and be on the market sooner than expected, then I would suggest that TRIP is a good horse to ride. The company owns a great asset lite business, has a great balance sheet, and when travel returns, its earnings power will grow again. The addressable market for travel is massive, and TRIP has lots of growth opportunities via market share capture and better execution. Moreover, TRIP can manage its variable costs and has reduced fixed costs, whereas the capital-intensive businesses like airlines and cruise lines require high capacity utilization (load factors) to make money.I would argue that TRIP is a quality business that is on sale. Moreover, this is a ""lower"" risk way to play the recovery in global travel, without having to worry about a bad balance sheet or waking up to nasty equity dilution.For optimists, I would argue that TripAdvisor is safer (albeit lower beta bet) over a cruise liner, airline, or casino."

It is not to look back and argue I called it right - you can't invest in hindsight.My point here is to look ahead and declare that this stock has no margin of safety and carries a very negative risk-reward profile. Here's why:Looking up and down TripAdvisor's Q3 results, there was nothing to sweeten its results and offer any sort of hope to investors. Pick any figures: revenue growth, non-GAAP EPS numbers, adj. EBITDA; everything looked grim.But what most concisely sums up TripAdvisor is this slide below:Source: Slide 13TripAdvisor points out that historically it was a cash-generative business - and that's great! But how will investors paying up nearly $4.4 billion market cap hope to profit from the past? I argue that they will not.(source)Further confounding shareholders' troubles is that historically TripAdvisor could point to its high EBITDA margins and argue that although it offered shareholders lackluster revenue growth, at least it was converting its revenues into cash flows at a very high margin.Meanwhile, Q3 2019 results firmly put a stop to any such delusions as its free cash flow was negative $22 million, the worst figure it had for years - stretching all the way back to Q3 2017 when it was worse.Also, if previously TripAdvisor's shareholders could charge that although TripAdvisor's revenues growth rates were not growing fast that its cash flows were steady - today, these are clearly turning sour.Furthermore, what's arguably more important is that TripAdvisor's $933 million of net cash will only provide it with breathing room. Because going forward, I'm assuming that TripAdvisor will start burning through $50 million of free cash flow per year (before acquisitions).The problem with investing is that it's not good enough to pick out cheap stocks.To be a successful investor, one has to pick out cheap stocks that have the potential to turn around. And I contend that not only does TripAdvisor not look like it's going to turn around any time soon, but the price investors are willing to pay is still too high (approximately $4.4 billion market cap).Why is this problem? Because successful contrarian investing is about selecting companies where investors' sentiment is so rock bottom that the price ultimately reflects this.Source: author's calculationsHowever, the table above reminds readers it's not only TripAdvisor which is trading at a depressing multiple, it's also the whole sector that has fallen out of favor with investors.Pick out any metric from the table, either P/Sales ratios or P/Cash Flows (before capex) ratios, and you will see that each company trades at a discount to their historical pricing.This informs us that the whole sector is undergoing temporary headwinds, and that only the fittest will survive.Will TripAdvisor be the most suited to turn around and profit from this sector's disruption? It is possible, but I'm unsure.But does paying up close to 3x its trailing revenues when it is struggling to convert its revenues into strong free cash flow provide investors with the required margin of safety?I conclusively posit that it does not.TripAdvisor has evidently fallen on hard times. This is never pleasant for anyone involved. And taking action in your investment does not mean shorting the stock. But I do declare that remaining inactive when the facts demonstrably show that TripAdvisor is about to enter a dark chapter of its life is unwise."
4337509,69905,2020-04-14T11:56:11-04:00,TripAdvisor is going to face a very challenging 2020.Every aspect of its business is likely to be temporarily impaired during this unprecedented period.This stock's trailing free cash flow metric gives it the illusion of being cheap.Investors should sidestep this investment now.,"TripAdvisor (TRIP) is going to embrace the most difficult period in 2020. Every area of its business is going to be challenged in 2020 as the pandemic severely restricts consumers' travel and dinning patterns.TripAdvisor looks cheap at less than 8 times its trailing free cash flow, but I contend this is a mirage. Sidestep this investment for now.Last month, TripAdvisor pulled its full-year guidance noting the overall uncertainty and noting that its business trends throughout March had ""substantially worsened"" compared with February.Looking back to its recent performance, this was already a company that had a very challenging 2019 - to put things mildly.TripAdvisor's 2020 guidance, before it was withdrawn, was nothing to make one feel particularly bullish about. It was simply hoping to be flat with 2019 at approximately $438 million of adjusted EBITDA.As a deep value investor, I'm very familiar with the aspect of being a contrarian investor. Indeed, having learned the hard way over time, something that is cheap can always get a lot cheaper.Furthermore, TripAdvisor's guidance for 2020 at the time was noted that its performance was expected to be stronger in the second half of 2020. However, we know that this is the period when the pandemic is going to have the most impact in the West.Put another way, given all the uncertainty, consumers are hardly going to seek to book a hotel any time soon.Starting in earnest in 2019, TripAdvisor decided that its best opportunity was not in hotel auction but its Experience and Dining (E&D) opportunity.TripAdvisor's E&D segment is responsible for close to 33% of its total revenue, whereas Hotels, Media & Platform generates approximately 58% of its total revenue, while its Other segment makes the remainder of total revenue.Indeed, looking ahead to the end of 2020, it was expected that its non-hotel auction revenue would drive the bulk of its future growth.Specifically, TripAdvisor estimated that E&D revenue alone would exceed hotel auction revenue in 2020. Thus, together with strong expectations for its advertising opportunity, reported within its Media business, it would succeed in diversifying away from the headwinds its Hotel business was continuously facing.To bolster its prospects in this market, TripAdvisor deployed $110 million toward two acquisitions at the back end of 2019 that would position TripAdvisor's Restaurant offering as an attractive growth opportunity that would be reported within its E&D segment.TripAdvisor's main segment, its Hotels, Media & Platform, derived 86% of its total EBITDA profitability. This segment's Hotel business already was facing strong headwinds before the pandemic and travel restrictions. Now, it's going to have an even more challenging period ahead.Consider this, TripAdvisor's other large segment, Experience & Dining, made a paltry $5 million for the whole of 2019, thus not a significant driver of overall EBITDA profitability to the company.Consequently, if for 2019 TripAdvisor's free cash flow was $341 million, on a trailing metric, TripAdvisor is not particularly expensive at less than 8x trailing free cash flow.However, here's the main problem: TripAdvisor's whole business model is likely to be impaired in 2020.If before the pandemic, TripAdvisor was guiding for its adjusted EBITDA to be flat year-over-year, then now it will certainly decline in 2020. The question is of course, just how much will its revenues decline in 2020, 5%, 10%, 15%, or even more?If TripAdvisor's revenues decline by 10% in 2020 compared with the same period a year ago, its cash flows from operations would possibly only reach $252 million, and even adjusting for a small reduction in capex, its free cash flow would probably reach $175 million in 2020, or 50% reduction year-over-year.Once TripAdvisor gets past this challenging 2020 period, it could look to its strong balance sheet to recoup traction. Specifically, TripAdvisor finished 2019 with a clean balance sheet and no debt, and $319 million of cash and equivalents.If TripAdvisor is able to stabilize what's likely to be a consistent decline in its revenues spanning two years, combined with unimpressive growth rates the past five years, then it could be a rewarding investment opportunity.TripAdvisor is facing its most challenging period ever.Although TripAdvisor does not appear to be particularly expensive at less than 8x trailing free cash flow, I believe that investors will look back to today's valuation over the coming 12 months and declare that today's valuation was expensive in hindsight."
4347986,104952,2020-05-15T11:58:18-04:00,"As we look beyond COVID-19, TripAdvisor's pivot into E&D will leave us with more concern than optimism.Google has launched hotel and airline metasearch features, and it can potentially expand into E&D metasearch as well.At ~1.5x P/S, the stock is attractively priced, though we will stay on the sidelines.","TripAdvisor (TRIP) is one of the companies most impacted by COVID-19. It recently cut 900 jobs or 23% of the workforce and restructured its revolving credit facility in a concerted cost-containment measure. Given the solid liquidity position, TripAdvisor will certainly be able to weather the storm in the near term. Upon the recovery post-COVID-19, however, the long-term outlook of its growing E&D (Experience and Dining) business remains uncertain. In particular, there will potentially be a tighter competition as Google (GOOGL) started to enter the market. It already launched its hotel and airline metasearch features in 2019, which disrupted all major online travel players. It seems as if it is just a matter of time before it starts launching its E&D metasearch with a booking feature.Online travel is one of the most demanding, competitive, and rapidly changing industries. A series of consolidations in the last decades have led to Expedia (EXPE) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) having a semi-duopoly positioning in the market. The two giants generate most of their revenues through an OTA (Online Travel Agency) business model, which allows accommodation searching and bookings in their platforms. Their secondary business model is metasearch, which their subsidiaries Kayak and Trivago have. It essentially is a performance-based advertising business that allows in-platform accommodation searching but will transfer the booking process to the respective travel providers or OTAs. Given the challenging industry, all of the players, including Expedia and Booking Holdings, have their share of problems.(source: stockrow)TripAdvisor, whose core business is metasearch, has even seen major problems over the last decade that have led to an existential crisis in recent times. Before 2015, TripAdvisor used to be a leading metasearch business growing steadily at over 20% YoY. However, the failure to anticipate the growing mobile-booking trends had resulted in the deterioration of the business as the conversion rate dropped. The situation did not change much in 2016 despite the site reaching 390 MUV (Monthly Unique Visitors), up over 23% YoY.(source: Q1 2020 earnings call slide)However, the company's turnaround strategy, which involved a major shift into E&D, has successfully driven a decent growth over the next two years. E&D has made up 29% of the revenue and also drastically reduced TripAdvisor's dependency on the metasearch business as of 2019. Within the same year, all the online travel players, unfortunately, faced a major conversion-related issue as Google decided to integrate a metasearch feature into its core search offering. As a metasearch business, TripAdvisor was severely impacted as its revenue dropped by ~4% YoY in 2019.(source: google)The fact that Google has launched a metasearch feature is the reason why TripAdvisor's shift into E&D will only temporarily solve the problem. At the moment, a Google search for ""Hotels in London"", for instance, will lead to a search results page with Google metasearch and a booking feature at the top of the page. A search for ""Restaurants in London"", however, will only feature short contact and location info of the restaurants at the top of the page without any booking or review feature. It also does not take too much of the browser's real estate as an organic TripAdvisor link is only a scroll down away. As Google expands its metasearch feature, however, there is a likelihood that it will look at the E&D market. Moreover, looking at the damage Google has done to even its top-5 advertisers such as Expedia and Booking, it may just be a matter of time before it branches out into E&D.TripAdvisor is still a renowned brand in the travel industry that draws hundreds of millions of monthly views. Given its $1.56 billion revenue as of last year and over $1 billion of liquidity, it is also the largest metasearch travel company. Despite the declining hotel metasearch business, the E&D business has grown by over 31% YoY in the last two years. Without the COVID-19 outbreak, it would have had a good chance to drive half of TripAdvisor's revenue by the end of the year.(BKNG vs. TCOM vs. TRIP vs. EXPE vs. YELP. source: stockrow)With that in mind, we also expect TripAdvisor to progressively be valued more like OpenTable (now owned by Booking Holdings) or Yelp (YELP) than the OTA counterparts. Currently, TripAdvisor indeed trades at ~1.5x P/S, which is more similar to Yelp than to the rest of its online travel peers. Yelp is also significantly impacted by the COVID-19, though it does not have any travel-related business segment. TripAdvisor is trading at ~$16 per share, down ~65% from its 1-year high. This means that despite our concern on the long-term risk, there is a near-term upside once the company goes into a recovery mode. However, we prefer to stay on the sidelines on this one."

But not every fallen angel makes for a rewarding investment.Investors need to be selective and seek out opportunities with positively skewed risk-reward profiles. With a $4 billion market cap, this investment opportunity is too expensive and is best avoided until cheaper prices prevail. Source: TripAdvisor.comThe most frustrating thing to read is some analyst talking down a stock, which has clearly fallen in price.The first argument the mind conjures up is ''tell me something I don't know''. But here's the thing, TripAdvisor has fallen in value, and currently it does trade near to all-time lows. The arguments from bullish shareholders will range from: I'm a long-time buy-and-hold investor, to I'm holding on to this stock until I breakeven and then, I'll call it a day here.Both of these arguments explain the feeling of the shareholder, they don't address the fundamental question of whether TripAdvisor offers the investor a compelling investment opportunity, right? Don't shoot the messenger, I'm simply highlighting the facts. Source: nhsreality.wordpress.comTripAdvisor ended Q3 2019 with a net cash position of $933 million; with no debt. Since the quarter ended, after the special cash dividend was paid out earlier this month, TripAdvisor now has $490 million less to play with. TripAdvisor's trailing nine months free cash flow hit approximately $304 million, but then we should factor in its $91 million of stock-based compensation which implies TripAdvisor's actual ''real'' free cash flow approximates $213 million.Accordingly, even though there is less cash available than this time last year, it is safe to conclude that TripAdvisor is a strong cash flow generating company.However, what investors need to consider is when paying $4 billion market cap for the stock, are they being presented with a bargain opportunity? Will TripAdvisor's free cash flow hit $280 million in 2019? Is it a compelling enough risk-reward investment when paying up roughly 13x free cash flow? Here the thesis starts to break down. Why?Source: TripAdvisor.comTripAdvisor points to its huge 460 million monthly unique visitors, but ''eyeballs'' will only drive its business model so far. What TripAdvisor is struggling with is to fully engage and monetizing its platform.Source: author's calculationsAt the start of 2019 TripAdvisor was viewed as a stable enterprise. What it lacked in revenue growth, but it made up by being a high-margin advertising asset. But with less leverage to spread over its cost base, this will ultimately dampen its bottom line EBITDA prospects in 2020. TripAdvisor CFO Ernst Teunissen notes that a decline in TripAdvisor's click-based auction continues to plague the company. The cause, as is well known, is Google's (GOOGL)(GOOG) SEO promoting its own hotel products in search results.Hence, this particular headwind is not likely to lessen in time. Consequently, TripAdvisor is attempting to reignite its revenue growth by instead focusing on its non-auction revenues. Here, it is still early days to know whether TripAdvisor is gaining any traction by leveraging its influence with travelers, but investors should watch this space. Source: author's calculationsThe table above is a reminder that investors are decidedly bearish on the OTA sector. None of TripAdvisor's peers trade at a premium, and neither does TripAdvisor.Data by YChartsIndeed, with the exception of Travelzoo (TZOO) which investors have largely left for dead, the whole sector has underperformed the S&P500 in 2019.Typically, a fertile investment ground is found by going after a sector where investors have become overly bearish.If TripAdvisor succeeds in proving that it successfully mitigate current SEO headwinds from Google, TripAdvisor may end being a compelling investment opportunity.However, I believe that TripAdvisor needs to prove itself first, and only then, once it can show that it can reignite its top line, at that point investors should reconsider this investment. For now, this is a stock best avoided."
4289235,69905,2019-09-02T19:26:06-04:00,"TripAdvisor has hit a stumbling block.Its valuation is not cheap enough for value investors. And not growing fast enough for growth investors.Ultimately, TripAdvisor is not compelling enough.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has a lot going for it. It's a stock which has fallen from grace, making it potentially attractive for bargain hunters.The problem for TripAdvisor is that despite having a large audience, it has largely struggled to convert its platform into a growing monetizable operation.Until there is tangible evidence that it can grow its top line, investors are better off avoiding this name.In the past, I had been bullish TripAdvisor (from the sidelines). In fact, approximately this time last year, when the share price was just a nudge below $37 per share, I was very close to pulling the trigger. With the benefit of hindsight, my instincts were on the ball, as the share price soared - but you can't invest in hindsight.Having once again fallen in price, I looked again at TripAdvisor with a fresh pair of eyes. My conclusion is that I simply can't make a compelling enough case for why TripAdvisor could work out positively.At the end of the day, it's not good enough to assume that, simply because something has become cheaper that it instantly predisposes itself towards being a satisfactory investment.Digging into TripAdvisor's Q2 2019 earnings, we can see that once more TripAdvisor's top-line was down, this time minus 3% compared with the same period a year ago.To be fair, management has been highly consistent with its message that investors should be patient and that TripAdvisor is not being managed to maximize short performance. Instead, that TripAdvisor is using this year to refocus its operations and lay down the foundation to make its top-line sustainably grow, starting with Q4 2019 and into 2020.TripAdvisor's main troubles stem from the fact that it's too early in the research process or research funnel to adequately capitalize on its audience.In essence, what this means is that TripAdvisor is attempting to go beyond just suggesting great places to visit, dine out or experience, but is aiming more towards being the go-between consumers and sellers.Now, this has often been the trouble for TripAdvisor, with its lagging top-line revenue as vindication for this point of view.Looking further ahead, TripAdvisor is now attempting a new strategy. How does TripAdvisor convert its eyeballs into a robust digital advertising entity?Source: Investor PresentationTripAdvisor declares that by 2022 the digital advertising sector will have expanded to $479 billion and that TripAdvisor is well positioned to take market share.Right away, just by looking at the peer group above, we can see how crowded and competitive this space already is. Realistically, I can't see a scenario where Twitter's market share will diminish at the expense of TripAdvisor's execution.Previously, TripAdvisor was able to highlight how its Experiences and Dining (E&D) segment was growing at a very rapid pace. In fact, up to Q1 2019, this segment which generates close to 27% of total revenue had been growing with a 40% CAGR.However, this past quarter (Q2 2019) has seen this fast-growing segment slow down to 33%. Is this just a bleep in performance, or is this single-digit deceleration to low 30s% year-over-year growth rates the new normal?On the other hand, TripAdvisor's bigger segment, Hotels, Media & Platform (HM&P), has fared even worse and now posts minus 7% year-over-year revenues.For now, investors have little to go on, but anchor themselves to TripAdvisor's adjusted EBITDA of approximately $465 million for full-year 2019.The table above is once again a reminder that TripAdvisor had been trading at higher multiples. Looking back a few years' ago, investors were willing to give TripAdvisor the benefit of the doubt. One could make the argument that TripAdvisor's asset-light operations could successfully cut out a niche in the highly competitive OTA (Online Travel Agency) industry and all will be well. But I fail to see how.In fact, thus far, despite much rhetoric and hopes, TripAdvisor has failed to gain sustainable traction.TripAdvisor has a lot going for it. Its main segment, Hotels, Media & Platform (HM&P) commands +40% EBITDA margins. These high margins, together with a strong balance but no growth, would make for a terrific business as a privately held business. But public markets being what they are, they will most likely to continue to compress TripAdvisor's trading multiples, until there is concrete evidence that it has what it takes to monetize its 400 million average unique monthly users (MAUs).Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."
4263908,101969,2019-05-14T14:13:37-04:00,"TripAdvisor is growing consolidated adj. EBITDA double-digits this year, even while reinvesting heavily in its Experiences & Dining unit. That means the overall business is surpassing its peak profitability years.
        Let me repeat that: record-high profits this year. That was unimaginable two years ago. And it is occurring even while aggressively reinvesting.
        Yet TRIP is -16% over the last week to just $46 per share. Given my Base case for Experiences & Dining, the highly-profitable Hotel business now has a negative value.","TripAdvisor reported its first-quarter results last week, and the stock price has been crushed. I'm going to tell you why, what the market is missing, and one way to think about TripAdvisor's new market valuation.As for the things the market may not have liked, management said current second-quarter trends in the Hotel business in some international markets are softer than expected. But they still expect a recovery in the second-half as the company laps the marketing optimizations from last year. The market also may not like the fact that hotel shoppers fell sharply in the quarter, driving total unique visitors down 5% in the quarter. This is mostly a result of the performance marketing optimizations on the Hotel side, which should stabilize later this year. More importantly, management is driving much more profit out of its slightly smaller, but higher-quality hotel shopper base.In the new realigned Hotel, Media & Platform segment, adjusted EBITDA grew 36.4% in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins reached 41%, up from 30% in the year-ago quarter.This segment is still seeing the benefits from management's eliminations of wasteful performance marketing spending. Essentially, the huge performance marketing spending cutbacks on the Hotel side has caused hotel traffic to fall but it was lower quality traffic that wasn't providing a positive long-term return. As a result, hotel shopper monetization has been rising and the segment is now spending far less on sales & marketing; hence, the significant profit growth and margin expansion. Management expects this to continue and has guided for another year of ""strong double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth"" in this segment.On the Experiences & Dining side--the crown jewels of the former Non-Hotel segment (and of the whole company for that matter)--revenue grew 29% as-reported but 35% excluding changes in foreign exchange rates. Bookable supply in the Experiences business grew a staggering 94% year-over-year to 202,000.As you can see in Exhibit 1, bookable supply is up about 6.5x over the last few years. That's impressive growth and very valuable because TripAdvisor has a huge amount of natural demand on the platform looking for things to book. Bringing that supply online makes it that much more likely that the demand on the platform will find things to book. In addition to the growth in bookable supply, the addressable market in the form of the number of reviewed experiences has almost doubled over this period. So while TripAdvisor is growing its portion of the pie, the pie is also getting bigger. Had reviewed experiences stayed flat over this period, we'd be talking about a 32% penetration rate. Instead, we're looking at an 18.4% penetration rate, suggesting much more room to grow supply in the years to come.It's a similar story with restaurants, as you can see in Exhibit 2.Bookable restaurants are up 71% over this period, but reviewed restaurants are up 32%, so the penetration rate hasn't changed all that much. So there's still a huge runway to add bookable restaurants in this business. I should point out though that the penetration rate is unlikely to get very high in this business for two big reasons: 1) reviewed restaurants includes North America, where TripAdvisor isn't doing restaurant table bookings, and 2) there are lots of restaurants that don't take reservations due to their nature, ie. pizza shops, ice cream shops, burger joints, etc. Still though, there is a lot of room to grow supply here, and like I said previously, more supply for all that demand drives up bookings and revenue.The Experiences & Dining segment should see reported adjusted EBITDA decline a bit this year as the company is aggressively reinvesting in the business to capitalize on its leadership position in a huge addressable market. The market may not have liked that, but long-term shareholders like me love it.What's The Market MissingIt's truly mystifying that TRIP is now available at $46 per share. Why? For starters, management's guidance calls for the whole company to grow adjusted EBITDA at a double-digit rate this year. That's a combination of modest declines in the Experiences & Dining unit, due to aggressive reinvestment spending, and a ""strong double-digit"" growth in the Hotels, Media & Platform business. Assuming 12% adjusted EBITDA growth this year, TripAdvisor will generate $473 million.I've followed TripAdvisor closely for a long time. In 2017, at the depths of TripAdvisor's crisis, total adjusted EBITDA was $332 million. That was down from a peak of $468 million and $467 million in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Analysts and observers were unsure if TripAdvisor would ever grow profits again after two years of steep profit declines. If you had told me then that TripAdvisor would surpass its peak 2014/2015 profit figures just two years later--even while aggressively reinvesting in the rapidly-growing Experiences & Dining business, which depresses profits--and the stock would only be at $46, I wouldn't have believed it. And if you traveled back in time and told the market that outcome was going to happen, the stock price in 2017 would have jumped to $60 on the spot. People would have laughed at you if you claimed TripAdvisor would not only stabilize but recover, grow adjusted EBITDA by over 42%, and make record profits just two years later. Well guess what? It's happening.ValuationAs you can see in Exhibit 3, TripAdvisor's market cap and enterprise value are $6.5 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. For close observers, I add exercisable options to the share count and add the amount of cash that exercise would raise to their balance sheet.First of all, TripAdvisor generated $350 million of free cash flow (CFO - capex) last year. That's a 6.3% yield after backing out the net cash from the market cap. That should strike us all as quite attractive for an asset-lite business like this, situated at the top of the travel funnel (along with Google), with one very high margin slower growing business and one even higher future margin rapidly growing business.However, another way I like to look at the valuation is to value the pieces of TripAdvisor. Let's start with the Experiences & Dining unit. Exhibit 4 shows my scenario analysis assumptions for this business.My Base case has revenue growth slowing fairly rapidly to single digits by 2025. I would hope they can maintain a faster growth rate for longer, but I don't want to get too aggressive. I also assume 65% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin in this business over the long term. To be clear, that's not actual adjusted EBITDA margin; it's the amount of the next dollar of revenue growth that drops to adjusted EBITDA. I think that's fair considering these platform businesses have already been built out, and one incremental booking shouldn't have much incremental expense.Exhibit 5 shows my Base case DCF that incorporates the Base case assumptions in Exhibit 4. It also builds in a 10% discount rate and a 5% unlevered free cash flow yield for the terminal value.As you can see, last year's 41% revenue growth slows down over time to a 10% CAGR over the next 20 years. Adjusted EBITDA margins gradually expand to about 51%. That's about a 43% operating margin. I actually think these margins could end up conservative because the Experiences business benefits from the monetization of an OTA, yet has a higher take-rate than the hotel OTAs, and it benefits from the lower traffic acquisition costs that TripAdvisor as a whole benefits from as a result of its low cost brand-driven traffic. So while management says this should have ""OTA-like"" margins over the long-term, I think they suspect it should be even higher but would rather not overpromise or attract more competition.As you can also see, these assumptions suggest a valuation of the Experiences & Dining unit of about $5.5 billion. To the extent that proves accurate, it suggests that the market price reflects zero value for the Hotel, Media & Platform business. Or the Other business, although that is worth very little.So the implied value of the Hotel business is zero, or perhaps a slight negative number if the Other business is worth $150 million. Exhibit 6 shows this math.But how much profit does that Hotel, Media & Platform business generate? Well, last year it did $329 million of adjusted EBITDA. And management's guidance is for ""strong double-digit"" adjusted EBITDA growth this year. Given management's comments, I think that suggests something on the order of 20% growth this year. That means this unit should generate $395 million of adjusted EBITDA this year.And the kicker is that revenue growth should improve towards the end of this year, heading into 2020, as the company laps its performance marketing cutbacks from last year. So revenue, especially display revenue, should see positive growth next year for the first time in a while. And given the operating leverage in this business, profits should grow further still. All this for a business unit that doesn't just appear free, but appears to have a slightly negative value--again, assuming my Base case assumptions for the Experiences & Dining are reasonable.Risks"
4285118,101969,2019-08-13T10:57:23-04:00,"TripAdvisor reported second-quarter results last week. For years management has tried to improve hotel monetization by attracting users down the funnel, closer to the transaction.
        Today, they seem to be accepting who their user base really is--mostly research-mode users--and have a strategy to significantly grow targeted ad revenue.
        Management expects Display and Platform revenue to double in 3-5 years. HMP revenue should return to growth in 4Q. Rapid E&D revenue growth should taper in 2H.
        The biggest risk is user traffic, which declined 8.8% year-over-year. Most of this is due to paid marketing cutbacks, which should be fully lapped by 1Q, but some is due to Google headwinds.","TripAdvisor reported its second-quarter results last week. Here is the link to the press release. The headline numbers are shown in the table below:Source: TripAdvisor 8-K FilingAs you can see, total revenue growth of -3% was due to the combination a 7% decline on the Hotel, Media & Platform (""HMP"") side, 28% growth on the Experiences & Dining (""E&P"") side, and a 32% decline in the Other business. I mostly ignore the Other segment because it's the catch-all for all the smaller orphaned assets that are now being optimized for profit, not growth. Excluding changes in foreign currency, HMP revenue declined only 4%, E&D revenue grew 33%, and overall revenue growth was flat.Adjusted EBITDA is the opposite story with HMP again growing strongly, +27%, and E&D declining 56%. The Other business improved adj. EBITDA by $5 million due to exiting unprofitable revenue streams. Overall adj. EBITDA grew 17%, but grew 22% excluding changes in foreign currency.Management continues to milk the HMP segment cash cow for current profits while using that cash flow to reinvest in the E&D business. So while E&D revenues continue to surge, E&D profits are taking a step back this year due to heavy investment spending intended to maximize growth in future periods.Importantly, the E&D segment should have very attractive margins at scale. I've written for a long time why I believe they should be higher than hotel segment margins, and on the call CEO Steve Kaufer stated E&D margins should evolve to where hotel margins have evolved to today. As you can see below, HMP adjusted EBITDA margins are now up to a healthy 43%.Source: TripAdvisor 2Q Prepared RemarksHowever, I think 43% is the new floor, not the ceiling, for HMP margins. Management's big new push on the media advertising side, to the extent they are successful, could continue to drive HMP margins higher.Media PushManagement talked much more on this call about their recently stepped up efforts to better monetize their audience from media and display advertising. It is an inescapable truth that the vast majority of TripAdvisor's hotel traffic are people who are in ""research-mode,"" and not yet in ""booking-mode."" I've estimated before that about 15% of their huge traffic actually gets monetized through downstream clicks to their OTA and hotel booking partners. The other 85% of users just consume the content, and TripAdvisor has historically monetized that portion of the audience very poorly.On the call, Kaufer said this:I find this to be a fairly profound change in focus. For years, management's strategy was to convert more of their research-mode audience to ready-to-book-mode. First it was Instant Booking, which was an effort to more or less become an OTA. After that failed, they revamped their website and app and developed a comprehensive television ad campaign that emphasized that TripAdvisor was a great place to compare hotel prices, and that TripAdvisor ""searched over 200 sites to find you the best price."" This was meant to incrementally increase the number of booking-ready users so that more of them would click downstream to their hotel and OTA partners, which would cause those partners to better value--and bid more for--TripAdvisor's traffic. On prior calls, management suggested those efforts worked and the company was sending more high-quality traffic downstream to their partners than before, despite lower hotel shopper numbers.Today, this no longer seems to be the focus. At least, it wasn't mentioned on this call or in their prepared remarks. It could be that effort has run its course and they are seeing diminishing returns in that area. In any case, today's focus is now on better-monetizing the vast majority who visit the site/app only in research mode. In some ways, management now seems to be more accepting of the reality that TripAdvisor is primarily a research site and less focused on changing its stripes. To me, that feels significant. After all, display ads and other forms of targeted advertising, which management is now pursuing, seem likely to be a surer bet than meaningfully changing the mix and behavior of its user base. After all, TripAdvisor's unique hook is that it is, hands down, the best place for travel research. That is why most people visit TripAdvisor. In contrast, it is not the only site to shop for hotel deals or compare hotel prices. Simply put, that is not the unique draw of the site.Importantly, incremental media and advertising revenue should come with high incremental margins. The variable costs of selling the next ad unit, or the next highly targeted ad unit, should be fairly minimal. Management intends to better-understand who their audience is, segment them, and allow advertisers to bid on advertising to those segments. I am picturing TripAdvisor's sales people being able to say, ""We have a group of 5 million MAUs that are currently planning a trip to Santorini, Greece for September or October. We can present these users with display ads for your 4-star resort in Santorini. We can retarget them across the web. We can send a follow up e-mail with special rates if they book certain dates,"" and that sort of thing. Better yet, programmatic advertising should allow advertisers more of a self-serve advertising, including video ads, so they don't necessarily need to deal with a sales person. Consider how good Facebook is at segmenting its audience and providing extremely good targeted advertising opportunities--TripAdvisor is light years behind in this, but is now focusing on improving its capabilities. That's why on the call, Kaufer repeatedly talked about their efforts to understand their audience better, which will allow them to sell better targeted advertising.In a sense, TripAdvisor is now willing to go to war with the users they have, not the users they wish they had.** This is a lightly edited quote of Don Rumseld, former U.S. Defense Secretary."
4246243,101969,2019-03-05T08:00:00-05:00,"TripAdvisor's Non-Hotel business is absolutely on fire. Revenue growth accelerated to 38% last quarter.Given my Base case valuation of the Non-Hotel business, the Hotel business has an implied value in the market of about $1.3 billion, which is insanely cheap.Given my Base case valuations of both segments, TRIP is worth at least $76 per share, a 47% premium to the current stock price.I'm not a catalyst-driven investor, but two things this year could get investors excited.","TripAdvisor (TRIP) reported their fourth-quarter earnings a couple weeks ago. It was a good quarter characterized by accelerating growth in the Non-Hotel business, which grew 37.7% in the quarter, and surging profits in the Hotel business.It is becoming increasingly obvious that TripAdvisor's two business segments should be valued separately. Non-Hotel is rapidly growing, heavily investing for growth, and has immature margins, while Hotel is on the cusp of returning to growth, has less investment spending going on, and has large and growing profits.To value the Non-Hotel business, I start with the scenario analysis table in Exhibit 1. As you can see, the key variables I use are Non-Hotel shopper growth, Non-Hotel revenue per visitor growth, and incremental adjusted EBITDA margin. I use incremental margin, rather than margin, because the result is dynamic and dependent on revenue growth.I run these variables through a discounted cash flow model. My Base case DCF is shown in Exhibit 2.For those who follow TripAdvisor closely, you may wonder about my methodology for allocating stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, and capex between the two segments. TripAdvisor doesn't provide that breakdown, so I simplistically allocate stock-based comp and depreciation based on revenue mix. I assume capex equals depreciation over the long term. And I allocate 80% of amortization of intangibles to the Non-Hotel segment since most of it relates to historical acquisitions in that segment.I apply a 10% discount rate and a 5.5% NOPAT yield in the terminal year. The result is a $5.2 billion valuation for the Non-Hotel segment.Personally, I think many of the Base case assumptions are conservative, particularly around Non-Hotel shopper growth and Non-Hotel revenue per shopper. Why? Because the Experiences and Restaurants businesses are still in their infancy. Experiences is estimated by PhoCusWright to be a $180 billion market. TripAdvisor is the market leader with only about $250 million of revenue, so there is an absolutely massive runway ahead. And the restaurants business also has a huge runway. Culturally, Europe is behind the U.S. when it comes to booking tables online, but should catch up since it is a better user experience than calling restaurants.Despite that, this is my current Base case. So what are the implications?If the Non-Hotel segment is worth $5.2 billion, what does that suggest about the implied value of the Hotel business? Exhibit 3 walks through TripAdvisor's current market capitalization and enterprise value, and deducts my Base case Non-Hotel valuation in one column and 85% of the Non-Hotel valuation, as a more conservative take, in another column.So the Hotel business appears to be priced in the market somewhere between $1.3 billion and $2.1 billion. This is a business with an unmatched content-driven brand and 145 million monthly unique hotel shoppers.Exhibit 4 shows some Hotel financial metrics for last year and my estimates for this year, and the resulting multiples. For those who follow me, you may know my view about multiples--they are a crude shorthand valuation technique with innumerable blind spots that can mislead investors. Nevertheless, these multiples are so unusually low that I think they at least give us a sense that the market is probably undervaluing the Hotel business.Whatever the Hotel business is worth, I would argue it is almost certainly worth a substantial premium to these figures. Typically, assets like this don't trade anywhere near multiples like these.But multiples are shorthand. So what is the Hotel business really worth? Exhibit 5 shows my scenario analysis for the Hotel segment.As you can see Hotel Shopper growth declines again next year. That's a combination of steeper declines in the first half, as management has indicated, and a recovery in the second half. I have revenue per hotel shopper (""RPS"") growing 8% in my Base case, but I do wonder if that could be higher. RPS grew turned positive in the third-quarter last year, growing 4.7%, and then grew 14.3% in the fourth quarter. It does seem like there is some fundamental momentum on this metric, which is being driven by TripAdvisor sending more leads and higher-quality leads to its OTA and hotel partners. Those leads have a higher propensity to book, which causes the OTAs to pay more for them. That's driving RPS higher, and I think that should continue. But I don't want to assume double-digit RPS growth this year or in the future, so I assume it grows 8% and decelerates to 4% growth in 2020 and lower from there.Display and subscription might grow 6%, which is a combination of higher subscription growth and probably declining display revenue, which is being caused by a long-term mix shift towards mobile, which has less screen real estate to show display ads. The Other Hotel business is being starved of capital and operated for cash, so steep declines there should continue.As for margins, TripAdvisor's business has very high underlying incremental margins. TripAdvisor gets paid for every click over to its partners, and one incremental click doesn't cost the company much. So I think incremental adjusted EBITDA margins can easily be 50% over the long-term.Here is my Base case Hotel DCF with those assumptions flowing through.As you can see, this values the Hotel business at about $4.7 billion. If anything, I think this is conservative because I have revenues only growing 4.0% over the long-term. Inflation alone is probably half that, so real revenue growth is extremely low. Management has several opportunities to grow revenue faster starting in the second-half of this year after it laps the impact of the performance marketing cutbacks. At that point, hotel shoppers and downstream clicks should both be growing and RPS should also be growing. So 4.0% long-term revenue growth seems conservative to me. Regardless, this is my Base case. And for those who insist on relying on multiples, $4.7 billion is 13.4x and 12.0x 2018 and 2019 estimated adjusted EBITDA, respectively, and a 3.9% NOPAT yield on this year's number.So what's TripAdvisor worth overall? Exhibit 7 shows my valuation summary.The total enterprise value is self-explanatory. Cash is cash, and I include cash from options assumed exercised (and add them to the share count). As you can see, this methodology values TRIP at $76 per share in my Base case, $56 in my Bear case, and $102 in my Bull case. With the stock having declined from $63 since my last report to just below $52, it is now trading at a very attractive price relative to my Base case appraisal of value. It's also cheaper than even my Bear case appraisal. Typically, things turn out very well when the stocks I look at trade below my Bear case valuations.What's NextI think things could get pretty interesting towards the end of this year if the Hotel business returns to revenue and profit growth. Profits are already growing like gangbusters there, but revenue growth has been elusive. Given the segment will be lapping the huge declines in performance marketing spending in the second-half, the negative drag on hotel shopper growth should fade away. So if hotel shoppers return to growth--or even just stabilize--while RPS is growing, that's a solid formula for Hotel revenue growth. With both segments growing revenues again, I would think the market might get a little more excited about the stock. The question would change from ""When is the Hotel segment going to stop declining?"" to ""How fast could Hotel segment revenues grow next year?""I'm not a catalyst-driven investor, but management plans to realign its segment reporting and provide more disclosures about its business soon. Usually, there's only one reason to do that--it's going to reveal things that the market interprets as bullish. I don't know exactly what the enhanced disclosures could be, but I have some ideas. It may be breaking down Hotel profits by revenue line item, so it would show profits from click-based and transaction revenue, profits from display and subscription, and so on. That would reveal that the display and subscription profit margins are sky-high. Or, management could break out Experiences and Restaurants from the declining Rentals unit. That would reveal accelerating growth in those two businesses.I have to ask myself why they want to disclose more. This part is speculative, but I think I might know. CEO Steve Kaufer was given an enormous incentive-laden compensation package near the end of 2017 that is primarily dependent on the performance of TRIP from then until the end of 2020. I wrote in detail about that package here. This is admittedly speculative, but it is not unheard of for a business to reveal enhanced disclosures about its business that the market interprets bullishly. Think about it. Generally, companies want to present their business in the best possible light. Why would a company reveal enhanced disclosures that the market would interpret bearishly? It wouldn't. Apple (AAPL) even stopped reporting iPhone unit sales because they are now going in the wrong direction.I think either of the two ideas I mentioned in the previous paragraph would probably be perceived bullishly. The precedent for this that immediately comes to mind is when Amazon (AMZN) broke out AWS as a segment in early 2015. Previously, the market did not know whether the segment was unprofitable, breakeven, or profitable, and the disclosures showed it was significantly profitable even while in heavy investment mode. Amazon's stock has been on a tear ever since. Obviously, I'm not suggesting TRIP is going to be a 5-bagger over the next four years like AMZN has been since then. But enhanced disclosures that the market likes would probably not be a bad thing for the CEO's equity-linked compensation package.ConclusionTripAdvisor's Non-Hotel business is on fire and is very valuable. So valuable that the implied value of the Hotel business is far too cheap. Overall, I think the stock is worth at least $76 per share, a 47% premium to its current price. In addition, the Hotel business returning to revenue growth towards the end of this year, and the upcoming enhanced disclosures, could improve sentiment towards TRIP."
4238477,67473,2019-02-06T03:39:58-05:00,"Tollymore Investment Partners is a private investment partnership investing in a small number of exceptional publicly listed businesses to compound partners’ capital over the long term.Includes detailed analysis of the partnership's positions in Amerco, Gym Group, ITE Group and TripAdvisor.In December 2018, the partnership acquired shares of Trupanion at a price of $23.3 per share.","Original PostTollymore Investment Partners commentary for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018.Dear partners,In 2018 Tollymore generated returns of +4%, and an annualised performance since inception of +20%.*Since inception on 12 May 2016, gross of adviser fees, unauditedOver the past few years I have discussed Tollymore's investment philosophy and process in detail in investment letters, interviews, articles and presentations. I have used investment decision making examples as a mechanism for current investors and prospective allocators to understand how I make decisions, and allow them to judge the consistency of these decisions with the key principles of the investment strategy.As an emerging investment management firm Tollymore has the advantage of organically building a set of aligned investment partners, deeply appreciative and practically aware of the significant behavioural edge that a long-term mindset affords in public market investing; investors who think like business owners rather than traders.Key elements of such a symbiotic relationship between manager and client are transparency, integrity and authenticity. As such, this letter delves deeper into the investment merits of the portfolio's largest holdings, as well as the most recent investment. Understanding the intrinsic value potential of a portfolio allows successful money managers to stay the course in periods of self-doubt. By being transparent about the companies we own and why we own them I hope to give investors the tools to share my fundamental appreciation of the portfolio's potential, allowing them to invest countercyclically to the ultimate benefit of the investment partnership's capacity to sustainably create value for all partners.The partnership's four largest holdings, in alphabetical order, are Amerco, Gym Group, ITE Group and TripAdvisor. All four companies are founder-led, provide enduring products and services, and have demonstrative capacity to generate sustained supernormal profits. They differ in their scope for organic capital reinvestment into valuable projects, and therefore the importance of the stock's multiple of owner earnings in determining the potential IRR available to equity owners.One thing they all also have in common is that they screen terribly. Reasons are various and are discussed below. Screens miss one of the most compelling sources of mispriced securities: those companies whose reported financials poorly reflect the underlying cash earnings' power of the business, due to for example high reinvestment rates, inappropriate accounting policies or business model transitions. All such examples are described below.Amerco ticks all the boxes of a reinvestment moat, stewarded by excellent long-term business owners and capital allocators, and trading at a modest multiple of normal earnings power. The DIY moving market was essentially created with the founding by Leonard and Anna Shoen of Amerco in 1945. Today 40% of movers in North America are DIY vs. professional moving companies. Shoen spent decades signing up land-owner franchisees across North America, developing a network across the country which allowed users to collect vehicles in one location and drop off at another, facilitating 'inter-city' house moves.U-Haul, the brand behind Amerco, has made the most of its first-mover advantage by aggressively expanding its network of franchised moving service locations. Each additional location increases the value of existing locations by enabling more convenient pick-up and drop-off logistics for an increasing number of moving routes. This should increase the steady state asset utilisation of the business. Franchisees are attracted by the number of U-Haul customers; customers are attracted by the convenience of franchise locations. This virtuous circle drives market share and revenue growth, which has been reinvested in more locations and vehicles, making U-Haul's dominance increasingly difficult to replicate. Today U-Haul as eight times as many locations as its nearest competitor, and four times as many trucks. Management has clearly identified the source of the moat for this business and has continually reinvested capital in widening it over time. This network advantage limits the ability to add supply in the 'one-way', inter-city moving market.Trucks are necessary for moving but people move infrequently; these characteristics lend themselves to a rental business model. Moving depends on idiosyncratic factors such as the need to upsize, downsize, get divorced, get married, move jobs, attend and leave college etc. The need for more affordable housing is a significant reason for moving, likely a countercyclical driver of volumes. If humans live in houses, regardless of how those houses are financed, and if changing life circumstances cause them to move homes several times through their lifetimes, none of these drivers of demand is set to change materially long into the future. It is very possible, however, that Amerco captures an increasing share of the total costs incurred in making these moves.Another example of management directing capital to widening the business's unfair advantage is the development of MovingHelp.com. Movinghelp.com is a platform bringing together supply of and demand for moving labour. As the number of providers of labour grows, the more users are attracted by greater availability. The accumulation of independent reviews also creates stickier supply and encourages better customer service, increasing demand.The U-Haul brand is well-recognised and ubiquitous; there are 65% more U-Haul locations in the North American network (20k) than there are Starbucks coffee shops (12k). The orange and white livery and U-Haul logos adorn its 100k trucks, 80k trailers, 20k truck rental nodes and 1,100 storage locations, serving as a free mobile and ubiquitous advertising machine. Since its inception U-Haul has grown its dominance in DIY moving. Several competitors have tried to enter or grow in the space, but none has succeeded in denting U-Haul's market share. The industry has consolidated down to three main players today: U-Haul, Budget Truck Rental and Penske Truck Rental. Budget generates 15% of the revenue of U-Haul with a truck fleet one quarter the size and has been retrenching, highlighting the economies of scale in the industry and U-Haul's network advantage.The other major use of the company's operating cash flow has been the purchase and greenfield development of self-storage facilities. Like truck rental, self-storage is a commodity offering. The site acquisition and build costs are low, lowering barriers to entry. Hence there are many players in a fragmented industry. As fixed costs are high there may also be the temptation to cut prices to fill capacity. However, once tenants are secured, switching costs are high and so rent increases can be imposed. This, coupled with low maintenance costs and high operating leverage, mean that returns can ramp up quickly. Amerco can use its U-Haul brand and ability to hook truck customers into the sales channel via its website to lower self-storage customer acquisition costs. This potentially lowers Amerco's self-storage breakeven price and occupancy vs. peers.I think several factors suggest that the company's capital can be deployed at high incremental returns: a wider economic moat, industry consolidation, capital reinvestment into very high margin self-storage services, operating leverage, and declining labour intensity as technology lowers the cost of generating business.Multiple avenues for earnings' growth suggest that owner earnings' reinvestment rates can continue to remain high for a long time:Since we initially acquired shares in February 2017 for $370 per share, the stock has fallen 9%, materially lagging the market over the last two years. There have been several short-term pressures on Amerco's profitability over this period. There has been some pressure on operating profit margins due to the acceleration of truck and self-storage asset expansion and the tweaks to the company's depreciation policies to front load tax-deductible depreciation ahead of the corporation tax reductions. The fleet increased 10% yoy in 2018 but management expects this to be roughly flat in FY19 as truck acquisition slows and used truck sales pick up. EBITDA margins however continue to improve.Asset utilisation has been constrained by low occupancy rates on self-storage assets and lower truck fleet utilisation. However, self-storage square footage has increased 50% over the last three years and the CFO on the call stated that revenue per square foot continues to rise 3-4% yoy and the average occupancy on units older than three years is 84%, vs. 39% for units younger than three years. Given lofty self-storage market prices, UHAL has been focused on a build vs. buy growth strategy, with its associated larger drag on average occupancy. Finally, a collapse in used truck disposal profits was due to an effort to slow down sales and maximise the depreciable asset base ahead of the corporation tax rate change, and poor execution in underwriting the sale of waiver insurance, incurring elevated repair costs in getting vehicles into a sellable condition. The elevated disposal profits are something we highlighted in our original research and normalised for in the owner earnings calculation.Listening to Amerco's investor conference calls is instructive. Some comments from participants on recent calls reflect a level of frustration at the long-term horizon of management's capital allocation choices, pleading for the installation of a regular dividend and buyback. I disagree. A dividend should be the last thing this company is doing, and despite the stock failing to remotely keep pace with the market's rally over the last few years, a buyback would shrink an already small free float. My sense is that management is making capital allocation decisions that are designed to maximise the total future economic value of the business. I don't care whether this is realised later vs. sooner, if the company's investments are returning more than our opportunity cost of investing. With the company's widening moving and storage network advantage and a CEO who is paid < $1mn per year but whose family owns most of the business, I think this is likely to be the case.Over the last 12 reported months of business operations Amerco generated operating cash flow of almost $1bn. Amerco's enterprise value is less than 9x this number. With capex of over $1.7bn Amerco is currently generating FCF of c. -$700mn. Adjusting for c. $1.1bn of growth capex, maintenance FCF = +$4-500mn, a 6-8% yield to the market cap for a business with evidence of high cash reinvestment rates and high incremental returns on capital.Gym Group enjoys a cost advantage facilitated by superior asset utilisation and a long runway for value accretive asset growth. GYM was founded in 2007 and is today the second-largest low-cost gym operator in the UK. It runs 150 gyms and has 700k members. All revenues are generated from membership fees and joining fees. The company has a sense of purpose/coherent mission, which is to help people improve their wellbeing, whatever their fitness of financial starting point or location. The fact that consistently 30% of new members have never been a gym member before suggests this mission is being accomplished. This is a relatively capital-intensive business. However, while 30-40% of revenues are spent on capex, c. 4-6% of revenues relate to maintenance capex.GYM is a market leader in a fragmented industry: There are over 2k private gym operators in the UK, running 3.7k private gyms. The ten largest operators account for c. 650 gyms, 18% of the total number of private gyms, and GYM accounts for c. 4% of all private gyms. The low-cost gym model has grown rapidly by addressing the barriers to gym membership: (1) high membership cost and (2) being tied into contracts. The proposition of ""high quality, low cost"" appears to be well received: GYM's net promoter score is very high: +60. 55% of new members come from referrals.GYM can profitably offer average memberships 60% below private sector averages due to higher utilisation of site space (170 stations per gym vs. 60 private market average, and limited wet/racquet/café facilities/24-7 opening hours) and the employment of technology rather than employees for customer sign up and management. Customers enter the gym via a PIN entry system. The joining process is online, or via on-site internet connected kiosks, lowering customer acquisition and management costs.In reviewing thousands of potential sites over the years GYM has developed relationships with landlords and property agents. It is conceivable that the brand and GYM's strong covenant rating may be competitive advantages when it comes to securing new sites with landlords.Low cost gyms have been growing 50% pa but low-cost gym membership in the UK is still only 3%. Low cost gyms in the UK are 8% of the total. In the US and Germany half of gyms are low cost (and rising), accounting for the higher gym penetration rates in those markets. The low-cost segment in the UK has both taken share from the traditional segment and grown the market (in every year since 2008 >30% of new GYM members have not been a gym member before). This has resulted in low cost club CAGR of >50% since 2011. Initial site investment costs have declined as a result of economies of scale. Gym fit-out contractors are awarded contracts through more competitive tender processes, better terms are agreed with equipment suppliers and service providers such as cleaning. The economic return on marketing spend has improved as the number of sites and members has grown.Estate maturation should improve margins: Average mature site EBITDA margin/ROCE is 47%/32%. Yet the average site EBITDA margin is 40%, and the EBITDA margin for the group is 30%.In my view, the principal risks that may cause the future to unfold in a less favourable way than the above analysis anticipates are: (1) member churn/customer response to real disposable income erosion; (2) input cost inflation, and (3) irrational and aggressive competitive reaction.Churn and customer demand elasticity: members can cancel without charge at any time. To re-join would incur a £20 fee. Annual membership attrition (cancellations net of re-joiners) is 100%; 30% of leavers re-join. Management has stated that it does not consider cancellation to be a KPI for the business. This is for two reasons: (1) Cancellation improves membership yield as new members join at higher prices than cancelled members. And (2) the cost of acquiring a new member is less than the joining fee. This is due to marketing economies of scale and word of mouth recommendations (more than half of new joiners are costless referrals).Competitive response: Mid-tier gyms may cut their membership fees to compete with the increased popularity of low-cost fitness clubs. However, despite prices 60-70% below mid-tier gyms, GYM's margin profile is vastly superior. This is also despite having a lower percentage of the estate comprising mature gyms vs. established non-growing mid-tier competitors. Mid-tier and premium competitors have lower margins than GYM. This lowers their headroom for profitable price cuts. The competitive response from the mid-tier/premium segment seems to have been benign. Mid-tier/premium operators have upgraded their service to warrant the premium they charge and/or have increasingly targeted the top end of the market which they argue is not addressed by the low-cost segment. Mid-tier and premium gyms have consistently increased their fees each year. One mid-tier operator, Fitness First, did attempt to create a low-cost arm, opening Klick Fitness in 2012 with 6 gyms. Just over 12 months later the group exited the sub-sector. The mid-tier peer group has been restructuring, with consolidation on-going in the market.Leverage/recession risk: In the event of a recession prices and memberships may erode. GYM has high financial gearing in the form of operating lease obligations. Given GYM's operating leverage mature site profitability would fall significantly should the business experience a marked revenue decline. I estimate that a 20% drop in revenues would reduce the owner earnings to £17mn from £40mn in a no-growth scenario. This is still a 5% yield to the current market cap. Current adjusted net debt/EBITDAR = 3.5x; assuming the maintenance profitability of the estate this is 2.5x. This would be 6x with a 20% revenue decline assuming zero capacity to cut 100% fixed costs, or 3.8x based on maintenance profitability. Under these assumptions GYM's EBITDA margin would be 13%/ and maintenance EBITDA margin 35% vs. the current 30% rate (and 47% mature gym rate). It is difficult to envisage a 20% revenue decline due to the immaturity and increasing penetration of low-cost gyms, as well as the 60-70% price discounts vs. mid-tier competitors. When US membership growth was negative in 2012, Planet Fitness still grew its memberships by 28% yoy. This might suggest that the large discount lowers the price elasticity of demand for budget gyms.High reinvestment rates mean GYM screens poorly: With a P/E ratio of 47x and a FCF yield of negative 4%, many investors will write off GYM's investment merits. However, owner earnings3 c. £40mn, a 12% yield to the current market cap.These owner earnings are largely being directed to clearly above cost of capital projects. I estimate the total capitalised costs per new site are c. £1.5mn, and the economic profit per gym is c. £0.3mn, leading to after-tax returns on incremental capital in excess of 20%. So, for every pound of owner earnings invested, GYM can create £2 of value. Unfortunately, the board has a progressive dividend policy with a 10-20% payout ratio target. With the company's unit economics and runway for growth I would prefer that 100% of earnings were reinvested in asset growth. However, 10-20% of reported earnings will be much lower than 10-20% of owner earnings. If 90% of owner earnings are reinvested an equity investment in GYM could yield annual returns in excess of 20%.What should a demanding investor be willing to pay for:ITE is involved in one business activity: it organises exhibitions and conferences. ITE hires venues and gathers a group of exhibitors and visitors, monetising the exhibitor side of the network by charging companies for floor space. The company operates across several sectors including construction, food, energy and travel and tourism and predominantly emerging market geographies.While multi-year agreements can be struck to secure venue capacity, these agreements have the flexibility to modify capacity commitments ahead of changes in demand. There is good revenue visibility thanks to forward bookings.Operating margins have been reasonably stable due to moderate operating leverage, but current levels of operating profitability of c. 22% are around 5ppts below mid-cycle levels. Some of the margin run off has come as a result of deferred revenue increases, with exhibitors securing their participation at future events at more competitive rates. What therefore may be surrendered in terms of income statement profitability is recovered via working capital inflows and FCF conversion. Despite this, as we will discuss, management has a plan to restore the business to operating margins in the high twenties.ITE is an appropriately capitalised business given high revenue visibility, strong repeat business and multi-year agreements. Despite £50mn of debt-funded M&A in FY18, net debt = £80mn, 1.4x EBITDA, two years of FCF and around one quarter of ITE's equity. Revenue is recognised at the completion of an event; cash is received from exhibitors in advance and booked as deferred income. This is a costless source of finance and represents a working capital inflow when revenues are growing (but a drag on FCF when revenues decline, as they did FY15). This deferred income float has typically been c. 40% of sales, but since the founder of the business returned as CEO this has grown to two thirds, strengthening cash conversion.A long track record of supernormal profits seems to emanate from two sources of competitive advantage: (1) Network effects: visitors are needed in order to attract exhibitors and vice versa, making it difficult for a non-established player to gain traction. And (2) intangible assets: trademarks and licences to operate venues, databases of consumers and exhibitors, brand reputation that makes participants reluctant to move away from a tried and tested event. The value chain is symbiotic: customers do not want competing trade shows; they want to know that their customers are going to be at the event they are attending that year. This is a form of efficient scale; there is only space for a handful of profitable operators within each region and industry niche.I have classified this as a legacy moat business (rather than a reinvestment moat or a capital light compounder) due to the lack of greenfield organic opportunities to build new exhibitions around the world. However, ITE does have a strong foothold in several emerging markets including China and India. ITE has established market-leading positions through fully owned subsidiaries and controlling interests in locally dominant exhibition brands. For example, it has a controlling stake in the market leading conferences business ABEC in India which runs 20 exhibitions across the country. ITE has offices in Beijing and Shanghai, operated through a JV with Hong Kong-based Sinostar. ITE also runs conferences across Indonesia via a JV partnerships and wholly owned subsidiaries.The organic growth trajectory has inflected positively, partly due to the economic stabilisation in a number of ITE's end markets, and partly due to a business improvement programme put in place as a result of a change of CEO in 2016.A series of macroeconomic and geopolitical shocks have beset ITE's end markets and impeded business progress in the three or four years prior to 2017. These included the Russia-Crimea crisis and resulting trade sanctions at a time when Russia was a much larger part of ITE's business, and a 70% collapse in the price of oil harming business in ITE's energy-dependent central Asian markets.This improvement in top-line growth should bode well for the capacity of the business to meaningfully increase underlying cash generation, especially given the strides management is making in collecting cash for conference pre-bookings. As we will discuss, the market implies that the exact opposite will happen; that the sustainable cash the business can generate will wither significantly, and the stock has continued to move in the opposite direction to the business's progress.As legacy moat business with limited opportunities to build new shows organically, M&A will always be part of management's capital allocation agenda. It is therefore important to understand the management team, their track record and incentives. The founder Mark Shashoua has returned to the business with a plan to improve the organic growth potential and profitability of the current portfolio. He is divesting the least profitable, sub-scale events. He has executed this transformation playbook at i2i Events, which enjoyed a doubling of revenues and profits before being acquired by Ascential Events under his five-year leadership prior to returning to ITE, the company he founded in 1991.In 2018 ITE announced the acquisition of Ascential Events Limited from Ascential plc, based on an EV of £300mn. The target assets comprise two global exhibitions brands, Bett and CWIEME, and several UK exhibitions brands such as the Spring and Autumn Fairs and Pure. The CEO and COO of ITE Group are very familiar with these assets; they ran them together 2011 - 2016 as CEO and CFO.Management incentives have improved with the management change and are reasonable but not standout. Base salaries for the CEO/CFO are £450k/£250k. Bonuses are a function of headline PBT, organic revenue growth, cash conversion and qualitative strategic targets. LTIP awards are based on recurring EPS and relative TSR versus a combination of the FTSE Small Cap and FTSE 250 Index constituents. What is interesting is that ITE's earnings per share need to grow by 75% over the next two years for any of the LTIP to vest. For 100% of the LTIP to pay out ITE needs to generate EPS of 14.4p by September 2020, almost treble the FY18 EPS, and a 25% yield to the current share price.All these measures were only introduced in 2017. While cash conversion is a sensible target, some measure of incremental returns on capital would be a welcome addition to the incentive programme, given the high cash generation of the business and the limited obvious long-term redeployment opportunities. I would say that the track record of the new leadership and some incentive framework progression are improving stewardship of a demonstrably wide-moat business that has suffered macro headwinds which have shown signs of dissipating. This is not a turnaround thesis; this is a fantastic, highly profitable business already, and one that can benefit from three tailwinds: (1) cyclical/macro mean reversion, (2) structural portfolio improvement driven by positive management change, and/or (3) a potential re-rating of the shares to reflect the former drivers.The share price has collapsed since 2014 due to a series of macro and geopolitical events including the Russia/Crimea crisis, oil price collapse and rouble depreciation.The share price has fallen by 50% in the last year to a 52-week low. More recently the company has suffered non-fundamental selling pressure as the portfolio has become much less emerging market focused. In my view the company's stock price has moved in the opposite direction of the business's performance and private business value.ITE's cash flow and owner earnings are materially higher than reported earnings per share due to a large deferred revenue float, impairments of prior capital allocation decisions and amortisation of quasi-permanent assets such as customer relationships and internally developed brands.Trailing FCF of the business is c. £30mn (adjusting for restructuring costs and biennial events); this is 25% of ITE's equity and debt funding and 19% of core Group revenues, excluding the contribution from Ascential. Organic revenue growth is running at double digit levels.So that is what the business is generating. How is the market pricing that? The current £450mn market cap accounts for a £265mn rights issue-funded acquisition completed in the summer. So, the market is valuing ITE's pre-acquisition cash flows at a 16% yield. This implies material FCF erosion in the core business or zero or negative FCF margins in the newly acquired assets. Or that ITE has massively overpaid for Ascential.This despite the core business recording 11% organic revenue growth in 2018 and the acquired assets, which ITE's management believe have been poorly managed, generating 31% EBITDA margins.So, did ITE overpay for the deal? They believe they are paying 11.5x EV/EBITDA for an ungeared business that can grow revenues double digits. That seems reasonable. In the case of zero revenue or cost synergies they are paying 12.5x EV/EBITDA for a business with high barriers to entry and capex intensity of 1%. I don't think that is expensive. It may just be the case that ITE is a better owner of this business because it is a core asset for them vs. non-core for Ascential. This is consistent with the comments Ascential have made about the deal (and with Mr. Shashoua's prior comments to me about Ascential not being a strong competitor as the company focuses on its data and analytics businesses).The market is not paying attention; I have spoken with large institutional owners of the shares appearing near the top of the register; for them ITE is a small part of a diversified portfolio and their understanding of the deal and management's prior history with the assets reflected that. A conservative appraisal of private business value would imply 70% upside to the current price. That is if we capitalise the trailing FCF generation of the core business at 6% and add the rights issue capital we arrive at an owner's value of £750-800mn. The global industry is projected to continue to grow at 5% pa, with many of ITE's markets expected to grow high single digits. This would also imply that management miss their own goals and LTIP targets substantially, as previously discussed. In fact, management is targeting (and is over-executing) high single digit revenue growth, margin expansion and large working capital inflows; this would result in FCF compounding 1.5x revenue growth.One- and two-sided network effects and a globally trusted, top-of-funnel, brand strongly position TripAdvisor to take an outsized share of the growing global online travel market. I have discussed my views on the TripAdvisor investment case in prior letters, so I won't repeat them here. TRIP continues to strike me as a good example of investors' inappropriate application of linear projections to platform business models. TRIP's potential for potentially explosive low-cost growth emanates from its ability to tap into existing demand (travel and leisure visitors) and connecting it to acquired or developed supply (Viator, La Fourchette). Therefore, TRIP is strongly positioned to be the winner in two winner-take-all markets: restaurants and attractions. For both restaurants and attractions, the number of reviewed items is multiples higher than the number of bookable items. These low penetration rates of bookable inventory (1% for restaurants, 8% for attractions) will provide a long volume growth runway.Adjusting the company's trailing FCF for stock-based compensation, TV advertising and non-hotel investments (assuming OpenTable margins achievable on a normalised basis), I estimate the business is generating c. $400mn of owner earnings, a 6% yield to the current cash-adjusted market cap, and c. 60% of invested capital. It's clear that the opportunity and capital allocation priority for the business will remain reinvestment for a long time. If (1) for every $100 we invest in TRIP it generates $6 of owner earnings, and (2) that $6 is all reinvested into projects which generate a recurring $3.60 pa, then TRIP has generated $36 of value, capitalised at our opportunity cost of 10%. Assuming average incremental returns on capital of 25% over the next decade and that three quarters of earnings are reinvested yields an IRR of c. 20%, and TRIP would be worth c. $40bn over the next decade.I have written in the past about the importance of being able to execute a long-term investment strategy. The portfolio management decisions that I have taken, and documented, relating to our ownership of TRIP shares since September 2016 are an example of the freedom that a sound investment process, appropriate working environment and philosophy aligned to manager temperament can afford in making decisions that are consistent with our stated investment philosophy. TRIP's quoted share price at the end of 2018 was $54, c.11% lower than our initial acquisition price in September 2016. Yet TRIP's positive contribution is responsible for c. 8% of the cumulative performance of the portfolio since inception, thanks to an environment and investor base that allow us to make investment decisions which are consistent with a long-term business owner investment philosophy; that is to average down in the face of short-term market pessimism and reduce exposure in response to excessive exuberance.In December 2018, we acquired shares of Trupanion (NASDAQ:TRUP) at a price of $23.3 per share. TRUP is a founder-led, simple one-product-one-geography business with single-minded focus on a niche service. TRUP has a superior value proposition and strong competitive position afforded by gestation of distributor relationships, a data flywheel and customer switching costs. It operates in a large addressable market with a significant penetration opportunity affording a potentially multi-decade runway for compounding owner earnings. It may come as a surprise that TRUP is also an insurance company.TRUP provides medical insurance for cats and dogs in the US and Canada. The problem that Trupanion is trying to solve is that it is difficult for pet owners to budget for the magnitude and timing of pet illness and injury. Pet owners do not know the average costs of pet healthcare for the pets that they own. Even if they did, they would not know if their pets will be lucky or unlucky for that breed and location.Trupanion's solution is a cost-plus insurance product which spreads the risk that the customer's pet is unlucky by subsidising unlucky pets with lucky pet premiums. Like any insurance product Trupanion allows customers to budget for the unpredictable timing and magnitude of loss, in this case pet healthcare costs.The distribution of TRUP's insurance products is primarily through vet and customer referrals. TRUP uses a network of c. 100 independent contractors called 'Territory Partners' to build long term relationships with vets; they are responsible for making vets aware of the benefits of TRUP's products to the vet's customers, with the goal of earning the trust of the vets.Like any insurer, TRUP must estimate and hold reserves for vet invoices which have been incurred but not yet submitted, a complex process requiring subjective judgement. Unlike most insurers TRUP is a cash in - cash out business; it does not have a substantial float, nor does the investment income from that float contribute meaningfully to the business's discretionary profits.Given pet insurance penetration rates in the US of 1%, TRUP's primary competitor is the pet owner who chooses to self-fund pet healthcare costs with cash or debt. TRUP is therefore focused on growing the addressable market vs. taking market share from existing players; the primary challenge in achieving this is the education of pet owners about the merits of TRUP's pet insurance.The nature of the insurance business model - risk is spread over a large membership for lucky pets to subsidise unlucky pets - is a barrier to profitable entry for small insurance providers. For example, given the fragmented nature of the vet industry, it would not be possible for individual vets to offer their customers insurance products.TRUP is the largest player in Canada and the second largest in the US, behind Nationwide. Nationwide started in 1982 and was the first pet insurer in the US. It has c. 550k enrolled pets; TRUP has rapidly grown to c. 500k pets and it is likely that TRUP will become the largest player in the US soon.High retention and net subscriber addition rates are evidence of a strong value proposition. The sources of this superior value proposition stem from (1) a cost advantage that is shared with customers, (2) a data advantage driving more accurate underwriting, and (3) switching costs and symbiotic value chain.TRUP is vertically integrated; it owns its insurance subsidiary and is responsible for acquiring and servicing existing customers as well as underwriting their insurance. TRUP estimates this vertical integration has eliminated frictional costs of c. 20% of revenues. These economic savings have been donated to consumers in the form of higher claims payout ratios. TRUP's strategy has therefore been to sacrifice the near-term margin upside of this cost advantage in the pursuit of a larger and stickier customer base and subscription revenue pool. This cost advantage does not manifest itself in lower prices, but rather the highest sustainable expenditure on vet invoices per dollar of premiums.TRUP has built a database over 15 years using 7.5mn pet months of information and > 1mn claims; it has segmented the market into 1.2mn price categories in order to more accurately underwrite insurance costs for a given pet. Of course, determining the point at which the marginal returns on incremental data diminish is difficult, but according to the CEO it would take a competitor 13 years to replicate this data asset. Although Nationwide is larger by number of pets enrolled, its data are likely to be less comprehensive for two reasons: (1) a lack of data for conditions not covered by policies, such as hereditary and congenital diseases, and (2) pricing categories by state rather than zip code, even though the cost of vet care can vary widely within states. TRUP considers its ability to accurately estimate the costs of pet healthcare costs by granular sub-categories crucial to its leading value proposition. This allows for the provision of more relevant products for the customer.Trupanion Express is software that was developed by TRUP and integrates with vets' practice management systems. Through Trupanion Express, TRUP pays vets directly, within five minutes of a vet invoice being submitted, disrupting the traditional insurance reimbursement model and obviating the need for customers to pay out of pocket and then submit a claim for the expense. This is clearly a superior solution to the reimbursement model in solving customers' cash flow problem associated with unexpected pet healthcare costs. In general, pet owners do not switch insurance providers due to the non-coverage of pre-existing conditions. Trupanion Express is installed in 10% of the 20k hospitals being visited by Territory Partners each year. The integration of this software is likely to improve the loyalty of pet owners and vets.Finally, TRUP insurance seems to be a win-win-win proposition for pet owners, vets and TRUP:The addressable market is large and underpenetrated relative to other developed markets. The differences in these other markets are not demographic, social or economic, but rather (1) the length of time comprehensive pet insurance has been available, (2) the value proposition in the form of higher claims payments as a ratio to premiums (higher loss ratios) and (3) vet vs. direct to consumer distribution models. Pet insurance companies in the US typically do not cover hereditary and congenital conditions, which are the forms of illness most likely to be suffered by cats and dogs, they increase rates when claims are made, they impose payout limits, and pay claims according to an estimated cost schedule rather than actual vet invoices. TRUP is different in all these respects and as such expects to grow the addressable market in North America to greater than 1% penetration. In any case, it appears to be the case that TRUP's value proposition is driving adoption in North America.The unit economics associated with the pursuit of this opportunity to grow the company's assets are attractive. The cost to acquire a pet is c. $150, around 3x the average monthly ARPU. Assuming the current 10% discretionary margin and a six-year average pet life, the IRR on new pets is 30-40%. At a 15% discretionary margin the IRR would be double this. I estimate that both ARPUs and discretionary margins would need to decline by 20-25% to render reinvestment in pet acquisition a capital destructive pursuit. This would contradict the economic reality of a market in which pet healthcare costs are increasing mid-single digits as new technologies and treatments are ported over from human healthcare, and the scalability of the business model.The CEO owns 7% of TRUP equity/$60mn and in total the executive leadership team owns 10%. This is c 100x the CEO's annual compensation. He automatically sells 2% of his shares each year until he has sold 25% of his interest in the company by 2025. This has been a source of criticism from short sellers but given the large gap between stock ownership and annual remuneration, and the zero-dividend policy, I don't think this represents misalignment with other minority owners of the business.TRUP's quoted market cap is c. $800mn, c.6x BV and 24x owner earnings of c. $33mn. A 4% owner earnings' yield is reasonable for a business with TRUP's high reinvestment rates and incremental returns on new capital investments if these can be successfully maintained. The strength of TRUP's competitive position and evidence that their value proposition is attractive to pet owners suggest that they can. These owner earnings are one quarter of book value, and the company is growing its assets (enrolled pets) 20-30% each year; 6x BV implies a 6% sustainable growth rate.Yet incremental returns on reinvested capital are higher than the return on existing net assets, leading to growth rates many multiples of that implied by the market. Finally, management expects scaling of the fixed cost base to drive margin expansion, leading to economic earnings growth higher than revenue growth. By 2020 if management achieves its targets it should be generating c. $450mn of revenues and $65-70mn of discretionary profits. Given the company expects to reinvest all discretionary profits into growing enrolled pets, retained losses are unlikely to improve over that time, leading to a potential RoE of c. 50% in 2020 on an owner earnings basis. At the current price the stock would then be trading at a multiple of its book value that implied zero growth, despite the ample room for enrolled pet expansion afforded by low market penetration and a leading value proposition.Wishing everyone a healthy and happy year ahead,Yours sincerely.MarkEditor’s Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

TripAdvisor has remained one of the top companies in this industry, and this is evidenced by the fact that revenue in CAGR terms has grown by 14% over the past ten years. Moreover, we also see that the growth in the Hotels, Media & Platform segment has been quite strong, up by 36% year on year, with the EBITDA margin up to 41% in Q1 2019:Source: TripAdvisor Investor Presentation May 2019More generally, with a growing number of travel bookings now being made online, TripAdvisor is benefiting from a growing market, and thus, the growth in earnings that we are seeing has not been surprising.Specifically, one of the most impressive of TripAdvisor’s business has been its ability to diversify - TripAdvisor has shown strong growth in Experiences and Restaurants. Particularly, Experiences Bookable Products has shown a 90% CAGR growth rate in the past two years, and the site has reached over 100K bookable experiences, allowing a user to essentially plan their travel itinerary through the site - i.e. in terms of selecting flights, booking hotels, and other tourist activities.Source: TripAdvisor Investor Presentation May 2019In this regard, TripAdvisor appears to be doing quite an effective job of serving the travel market as a whole. As opposed to a consumer using one site for booking flights, another for booking hotels and so on, TripAdvisor has come to offer a “one-stop shop” for consumers to be able to do this.From a financial standpoint, we can also see that, over the past two years, non-GAAP diluted EPS is up by 50%, while free cash flow is up by 42%:Source: TripAdvisor Investor Presentation May 2019Overall, the business model for this company looks quite strong, and the growth in earnings and free cash flow is there to back it up. I envisage that this stock will rebound quite strongly. In the short term, I deem a range of $70 (the high we saw for the stock in 2018) as being quite reasonable. Longer term, should we continue to see the stock produce this level of earnings growth, then a rebound back to the prior high of $85 as seen back in 2016 is highly possible."

We invest only in our very best ideas – typically 15 long positions or less and a handful of opportunistic short positions.Generally avoiding commodity-based companies, we look for businesses with strong cash flow, normalized earnings, and long term growth horizons.Includes detailed analysis of Greenhaven Road Capital's positions in ETSY, FCAU, SHSP, TRIP, YELP, EVI, BOX.In the third quarter, the partnership had positive net returns of approximately 3%, which brings year to date returns in excess of 12% net of all fees and expenses.","Original PostGreenhaven Road Capital commentary for the third quarter ended September 31, 2018 discussing the good and the bad business problems.Dear Fellow Investors,In the third quarter, the partnership had positive net returns of approximately 3%, which brings year to date returns in excess of 12% net of all fees and expenses. Individual returns will vary by investor class, so please check your statements. This marks our tenth straight quarter of positive returns. Let me assure you, this is not by design.In fact, if this past quarter had ended a few days later, our modest gains would have turned into losses. I am looking for out of favor and misunderstood companies with a multi-year time horizon. As a concentrated, long biased partnership, we will have down months, quarters, and years. The returns should not be linear, but with a little good fortune, over time we can continue to compound our capital at attractive rates.There are good businesses and bad businesses. Similarly, there are good business problems and bad business problems. Bad business problems include disadvantaged cost structures and overcapitalized competitors who can sustain years of losses in the pursuit of market share. Good business problems include the inability to satisfy demand. In an ideal world, we would short bad businesses with bad business problems, which will eventually be priced in by the market, and own good businesses with good business problems.One of the ""good problems"" is undermonetization, which can take many forms but is essentially some variant of undercharging or not taking full advantage of an existing customer base. For example, ad-supported companies can undermonetize by showing users fewer ads than customers/viewers would tolerate. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) does not monetize WhatsApp despite its hundreds of millions of monthly users and almost $20B price tag.The beauty of undermonetization is that there is typically a relatively simple ""fix"" that only requires tweaks to existing product offerings and/or pricing. Such changes typically are not capital intensive and have less execution risk than would come with launching new products or entering new markets. When pairing the ""good problem"" of undermonetization with a good business that has operating leverage, the results can be quite compelling as the incremental revenue easily converts to incremental profit.Initially, focusing on undermonetizing companies was not intentional. However, as I have reflected on our portfolio, the theme is certainly recurring. If TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) can monetize 2% rather than 1% of their website traffic, our investment should work out quite well. If Yelp (NYSE:YELP) can better monetize the efforts of their existing sales force by offering more flexible contract terms that encourage trial and generate more advertisers with higher lifetime values, our investment should work out quite well (see below for further commentary).If Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) sellers do not revolt and accept the new 5% commission rate instead of the former 3%, our investment should work out quite well. Again, these are tweaks to existing structures. Etsy will continue with the same shopper traffic, the same pool of sellers, and the same exact cost structure - just a few lines of code should increase earnings and revenue dramatically.When undermonetization is addressed in a business with operating leverage, we should see accelerated revenue growth and expanding margins. Given that improving growth and improving margins are catnip for many investors, the third driver of returns, multiple expansion, can work for us as well. Now, not all undermonetization is good or easily fixable, but as internet companies mature, I expect undermonetizing companies will continue to be a fertile hunting ground for new investments. While not the traditional altar for a value investor to pray to, the manner in which improving monetization can flow through the income statement is compelling.Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) - I have said in the past that I look for investments where the valuation makes sense. In my opinion, Fiat Chrysler has reached that point again. The company has transformed itself from a company suffering under the burden of enormous debts that could only think about debt repayment to a very well capitalized company. Fiat Chrysler is currently generating over $100M per week in cash.At the end of this year, their net industrial cash should exceed $2.50 per share. On top of this, after the end of the quarter, the company finally announced the impending sale of their parts business, Magneti Marelli, which will add another $4+ of net cash when it closes early next year. So adjusting for the sale of the parts business, FCAU has approximately 40% of its market capitalization in cash.Today, FCAU trades (ex cash) for less than 3X forward earnings. If we assume that they can achieve their five-year plan, shares ex-cash are trading for less than 1X 2022 earnings. Typically, these valuations only show up for sick and dying businesses.In contrast, Fiat Chrysler's U.S. sales were up 15% Y/Y in September and are up 6% year-to-date. The company also has several product introductions in the pipeline to introduce new models in categories where their brands have not been represented. Of particular interest are the new three-row, seven-passenger Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Jeep Scrambler pickup truck that will be introduced next year.Yes, Fiat Chrysler is a cyclical and capital intensive business, but it has been structured to allow for variability in revenue. At the company's recent Capital Markets Day, management provided guidance that the company could remain profitable even if U.S. auto sales dropped as low as 10M cars. U.S. new car sales dipped to 9M in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, so it is reasonable to expect the company to remain profitable in nearly all but the most draconian scenarios. The question is - how profitable? Fiat's Chairman is not a novice capital allocator. He makes the pilgrimage to Omaha. He finally has real levers to pull at FCAU.How might this play out? There are all indications that the company would like to restore their dividend. It would be interesting to see how FCAU was valued based on a dividend yield. They could easily cover a €1/$1.14 per year dividend - apply a 5% yield to that and you have a $22+ stock. It would not surprise me at all if Elkan initiates a combination of a tender offer and/or buyback to take advantage of the stock's price as I believe he is inclined in the very short term to try and walk the valuation up to be in a stronger position to effect a merger with another OEM to realize the enormous potential synergies.These options have never been available to him, now they are and I think they will be utilized in 2018, hopefully to dramatic effect. As a result, I have layered a small short-dated out-of-the-money option position and an in-the-money option position to allow the fund to profit disproportionately should this scenario occur. I do not purchase options as a regular practice and 90% of options expire worthless, so this cherry on top may disappear, but the opportunity well outweighs the cost. Given the company's current valuation, known catalysts, and orientation of the Chairman, I continue to like the set-up.Etsy - As previously discussed, Etsy has announced a significant price increase to a commission rate of 5%; when combined with the payment processing fee of 3%, the net result is a take rate of approximately 8%. Fortunately, this pales in comparison to the current Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Made rate of 15%. The value proposition to sellers of being able to reach 20M + buyers for a listing fee of 20 cents and only paying the 8% upon a sale of an item remains very compelling.SharpSpring (NASDAQ:SHSP) - SharpSpring has become a Top 5 holding through a combination of price appreciation and the purchase of additional shares over several months. SharpSpring is a SaaS (Software as a Service) business that provides marketing automation software primarily for digital marketing agencies who utilize their technology to run sophisticated digital campaigns that include web pages customized based on a visitor's historical activity.Purchasing SharpSpring's software gives a customer licenses for use with up to three clients. The software is also white-labeled so that an agency can present it with their own branding and can upsell if they choose. With this model, SharpSpring has an attractive LTV/CAC ratio typically greater than 6.In English, that means that for every $1 they spend acquiring a customer, that customer will generate $6 in lifetime value. The right way to run this business, in my opinion, is to spend every available dollar on sales and marketing to build the customer base, not worrying about short-term profitability. SharpSpring management agrees, and recently executed a convertible debt offering to access additional resources for marketing.SharpSpring operates in an oligopolistic market with three primary competitors: HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), Act-On, and Pardot (by Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)). HubSpot is the largest competitor and in a difficult competitive position relative to SharpSpring. HubSpot has a large customer base paying in excess of $30K per year versus SharpSpring charging less than $5K per year. HubSpot cannot easily slash prices 75% to compete on price, and given the near-parity of the offerings, offering a ""stripped down"" version is also not viable. These dynamics have driven adoption and market share gains for SHSP, particularly among smaller agencies.SharpSpring has benefitted from multiple expansion, but also has executed well. Product revenue grew 40% in their last reported quarter. In a more recent press release, the company announced a record number of new customers in Q3 while maintaining marketing efficiency (their LTV/CAC should remain above 6). There is a very long runway for growth for SharpSpring.The company will benefit from secular tailwinds in an industry growing over 20% per year. There is also a history of acquisitions in the space at premiums to where shares trade today. SharpSpring came to my attention through a conversation with Jeremy Kahan of North Peak, a manager the Partners Fund is invested with.TripAdvisor - TripAdvisor remains the dominant travel research company and maintains the largest installed base for travel apps. The company continues to make progress on their in-destination business for local tours and activities, and has been optimizing ad spending on the hotel business to improve profitability. We continue to hold the shares as it is entirely plausible that TripAdvisor can improve their monetization rates on the $1.3+ trillion in travel spend it influences.The company has announced but not rolled out a new version of the site, which features a personal travel feed that makes it easier to plan and book travel while putting an emphasis on friend and influencer recommendations when available. Like any major overhaul, it has the possibility of improving the experience and economics… or not. Time will tell.Yelp - We discussed Yelp in detail in Greenhaven's Q2 letter. The initial indications are that the transition away from one-year contracts and toward more flexible, ""cancelable at any time"" commitments has gone well. As management said in their quarterly letter to shareholders (Link):There remains the possibility of increased traction of new offerings, improved monetization, operating leverage, and multiple expansion.EnviroStar (NYSEMKT:EVI) - Given SHSP's strength and EVI's price declines, EnviroStar was replaced in the Top 5 during Q3. This remains a very large holding for our partnership, and there continues to be progress. The company has announced five acquisitions so far this year as they continue to execute their buy and build strategy. EVI will not screen cheaply for several reasons, including deal costs, which depress current year earnings, and a larger infrastructure, which depresses short-term margins.As EnviroStar scales, we should see operating leverage and margin expansion as this infrastructure is spread over a larger base of business. As discussed in past letters, there is also a dynamic where acquisitions made late in the year immediately increase the fully diluted share count but only contribute a partial year of revenue and earnings.While short-term earnings may be understated, the long-term potential of EnviroStar remains compelling as they create value with the ability to acquire assets at 5X EBITDA using a stock currency that is in excess of 15X EBITDA. When paired with the ability to improve the acquired companies and a current balance sheet that can accommodate significant debt, this flywheel can turn for a long time.There are a lot of ways to invest. There is a more quantitative method driven by particular ratios such as price to book, price to earnings, and return on invested capital. The investment I am about to describe is driven far more by the qualitative. For such investments, I often gain conviction through a synthesis of my life experiences and hypotheses about the future. To provide the context for our most recent investment, let me lay out three life experiences. They are somewhat disjointed, but are important pieces to the puzzle.The first relevant experience occurred when I was in business school. After the first semester, students got to choose courses that we thought would be interesting, so I signed up for a class called ""Managing a Multinational Organization."" I had previously managed a small company, and was intrigued by the prospect of pulling back the curtain on what managing a multinational company would look like. It was one of the best classes I ever attended… but it does not appear on my transcript.I walked out of the class after 20 minutes and vowed to never try to manage a multinational company myself. The issues of a small company are dramatically magnified when dealing with different languages, cultures, customer preferences, labor laws, regulations, etc. A large enterprise is exponentially more complex than a small business and requires special skills and tools.The second relevant experience came from my time in an operating role at Acelero, the education services company I helped found. We were looking at selling a technology-based product to Head Start programs, but selling this type of product was not something we had done before, so we tried to pick the brains of the smartest entrepreneurs in the space in order to shape our sales and marketing strategy. One day we were able to meet an individual who, in our opinion, had ""cracked the code"" in the education space, having grown from two guys in rented office space to eventually being acquired by a public company.When discussing how to sell in the education space, he said that their sales strategy hinged on identifying what motivated the customer, and addressing those motivations. This is pretty basic and common sense, but, he then went on to say something that proved to be incredibly insightful. To paraphrase:In regulated industries, compliance can drive hundreds of billions of dollars of purchases just because the product checks a box for regulators and allows everyone to keep their jobs.The third life experience also occurred at Acelero. When we first started, we had a paper checkbook in the filing cabinet. We ran payroll monthly using a bookkeeper. It was as low tech as you could get. As we added a few employees, we graduated to Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) where we could phone in our payroll.For a period of growth from 10 to 100 employees, we used a boutique PEO (professional employer organization), and when we crossed 100 employees, we switched over to ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), which was the provider of choice for larger companies. Over time, we did far more than issue paychecks with ADP as their data and systems integrated with our health insurance provider, our retirement plans, and our corporate learning tools.Unfortunately, we grew to hate ADP. We hated the (lack of) service, we hated the pricing, and we hated the user interfaces. However, we stayed with them year after year after year because they were integral to running our finance department, and the complexity and risks of changing payroll providers and interrupting all of those integrations were too high. Removing ADP as the center of this ecosystem felt like the equivalent of attempting a brain transplant - the integrations kept us captive as they created a very significant barrier to exit. We stayed not because we were happy, but it was too hard to leave.So to summarize, my past experiences gave me an admiration for the complexity facing large enterprises, a recognition that - particularly in a regulated industry - purchase decisions are often driven by compliance, and an appreciation for how integrations between vendors for critical systems can effectively lock in a customer. Recently, these experiences, coupled with two other themes that have been running through my research process, laid the foundation for a new investment.The first theme, discussed above, is companies that are ""undermonetizing"" can be attractive investments. The second theme percolating is also an obvious one: data is today's gold, and it is unlikely that companies will, on average, spend less on accessing, sharing, and protecting it. There is real career risk in skimping on data, and data management and cybersecurity have significant tailwinds for the next decade or longer.None of these experiences or themes are blindingly brilliant, but collectively they are the underpinnings for our investment in Box, Inc.Box started 13 years ago out of a USC dorm room as an online file storage company, effectively offering a cloud-based hard drive to store computer files. Today, there are multiple companies that will allow a user to store a virtually unlimited number of files for a nominal amount of money, or even for free. Online file storage is a ""bad"" business as there is little value add and it is effectively a commodity. The founders of Box realized that commodity storage could be a race to the bottom, so relatively early on, they began to focus on the enterprise customers (larger companies), and particularly companies in regulated industries.For large companies in regulated industries such as healthcare or defense, storing information is easy: compliance is the tricky part. Large companies need to control who can access files, and with whom the files can be shared both externally and internally. There needs to be a log of all activity surrounding the file. Who opened it, when and where did they log in from, etc.? There are file retention policies to be enforced. While Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Drive may work for a small business, the compliance needs of an enterprise quickly strain the functionality of Google.Do you want your health records stored on a free Dropbox account your doctor got by sharing the email address of 5 friends? If you run a defense contractor with 150,000 employees, do you want them using a hodge-podge of Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), Google Drive, and OneDrive? Large companies need more robust data storage solutions. They need the ability to share content internally and externally but also to have controls and records of how that sharing occurred. They need the ability to lock files. To gain a sense of the robustness of the Box offering, it is worth perusing this feature comparison datasheet (linked here).Over the last decade, Box has built a customer base of over 87,000 companies with over 10M users that store their data on Box servers, including 69% of the Fortune 500. Box has integrated with 1,400+ applications so far, including Google Suite, DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), and Slack. The products and integrations allow files stored with Box to be ""the source of truth,"" which means that while other applications can access files stored on Box, all of the changes are made and kept on the Box version where the security and sharing protocols can be applied. These integrations make it less likely a customer will leave Box, and diminish the chances that a direct or adjacent competitor could create a copycat product.The robustness of Box's current product suite and the lack of credible alternatives has led to very low churn rates: retention is 95%. Because of the addition of new products and the sales of additional seats, we can expect the core base of customers (before any new customer adds) to spend more this year than they did last year. In fact, Box's net dollar retention is running at approximately 108%, so even if no new customers were added, and with some attrition, we would still expect revenue to increase at least 8% before factoring in sales to new customers.Box has a very sticky product, and a large customer base. There is the potential to further monetize the customer base by selling a lot more product and services to the existing base to take advantage of being the holders of critical data. Box is sprinting at this opportunity. The company is spending over $100M a year on R&D. While meeting the compliance use cases of large enterprises is complex, it does not require this level of R&D spending.Box is aggressively building a robust pipeline of new products for release over the next two years, designed to improve how people work with and share information, the security of information, as well as applying automation and machine learning. Here are a couple of links to provide a sense of the future products and how they take advantage of Box's unique position and how far Box will be from a simple file storage company.Box Shield (video linked here) Box Skills (overview video linked here).Box recently added a new board member, Kimberly Hammonds, and in the press release she said,I feel the same way.I have not seen Box written up in any of the traditional venues like SumZero but it was presented by venture capitalist CEO Chamath Palihapitiya at the Ira Sohn conference. He argues that Box is a way for individuals and companies to benefit from the improvements in AI (Artificial Intelligence). Over time, Box customers (who are generally larger and have more types of data spread across more users than customers of other solutions) inevitably will want to apply artificial intelligence to their data.In fact, they will likely want to apply AI solutions from multiple vendors. Box is application agnostic and will be able to integrate with all of the major AI players including Google, IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Amazon. Thus, by storing files on Box, companies will have both the security they need and also the flexibility to work with multiple vendors to access and mine their files in different ways. Typically, when I hear a buzz word like AI, a combination of words like vaporware, hype, and short come to mind.In the case of Box, at this point only the expense of creating this functionality has been realized as these integrations have been built and are being tested but have yet to launch. The ability to apply the best AI offerings to data stored on box represents a free call option that could be another barrier to exit that generates revenue and is buzzworthy enough to generate multiple expansion.Box is missing one characteristic that I value: high insider ownership. Box was started by four college-aged friends with limited personal resources. Their first round of funding came from Mark Cuban. Eventually, as the company pursued developing for and selling into the enterprise market, they raised hundreds of millions of dollars in several rounds of financing. As a net result, the co-founder CEO owns approximately $70M in stock and the co-founder CFO just north of $20M. So while collectively they hold less than 5% of the company, they do have ""skin in the game"" and are not simply hired hands.Box operates in a massive market that they refer to as ""Cloud Content Management"" and size at $45B per year. I think no matter how we define it, it is likely growing and worth multiples of Box's current revenue. Last year, Box generated operating cash flow while spending roughly two-thirds of revenue on sales and marketing and product development (54% and 20%, respectively). Over time, a company's value should approximate the rates of return that they can get when they reinvest capital.As discussed before, with a customer base of 87,000 companies, it is easy to see a very high ROI on new product development. I am typically skeptical of sales and marketing spend as it can be a sugar high to drive short-term growth. However, with customer retention rates running in the above 90% and net dollar retention running well above $100, Box is actually probably not spending enough on sales and marketing. There is a slide on page 88 of their investor day deck (link) that shows revenue growth by cohort.It is beautiful. Several different years of customer cohorts have been compounding revenue growth well in excess of 20% per year. Now, marketing effectiveness may deteriorate over time, but the last two years have seen CAGR's of 24% and 20%, and there is still a largely untapped international opportunity as the U.S. constitutes 76% of revenue.All of the above paints the picture of a high-quality business with a bright future. Companies like this are rarely optically cheap. We are currently buying shares at just north of 4X next year's sales, which one could argue is cheap relative to many SaaS peers, (Dropbox and DocuSign have valuations twice as rich) but certainly is not on an absolute basis. I think one of the greatest risk factors here is multiple compression, particularly if growth slows.However, given the product pipeline and sales pipeline, I don't think the slowdown is imminent. In the long run, Box has the opportunity to continuously improve their business through a virtuous cycle of retaining customers and improving monetization. Product improvements lead to greater value add, which leads to greater utilization, greater lock in, lower churn, and higher revenue per user. Revenue growth and margin expansion are highly probable, with multiple expansion a possibility. No additional capital is required to grow.There is a long runway for growth, and multiple opportunities for additional products to be sold into a large and attractive customer base. Continued revenue growth of 20%+ for the foreseeable future, coupled with operating leverage and a very valuable customer base, create an interesting set-up.We ended the quarter with limited short exposure. The fund remains short ETFs targeted at short-term traders, a bond fund where the underlying interest rates received relative to the risk assumed do not pass my common-sense test, and two indices as very modest hedges.In September, we held Greenhaven's annual meeting in New York City. It is a special night for me, as I get the in-person opportunity to share context on the health and direction of the partnership, enjoy the company of our limited partners, and to say thank you. At the meeting, I spoke about three operating principles that have guided the firm over time. The first was to go slow and recognize that doing nothing is usually the right course of action. The second principle is to only pursue the ""Hell Yeahs.""If something does not really excite me, we will leave it to others. The final operating principle is that design matters. How we organize, who we invest with, and how we spend our time are the most critical decisions. The primary filter for all design choices is, ""can it help improve returns?"" This may sound simple, but it is very different than how most large hedge funds operate.Also at the meeting, we gave a small set of gifts to the limited partners in attendance that included the book Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts by Annie Duke. Annie Duke has an interesting background, awarded a National Science Foundation Fellowship to study Cognitive Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.She was also one of the top poker players in the world for two decades, winning over $4M in poker tournaments and a lot more elsewhere. She was also part of a group of players who helped each other improve their decision making. The group was led by a player named Eric Seidel, who has over $38M in tournament winnings.I think this book is well worth reading as it is a nice summary of probabilistic thinking and how to apply it. At the core, many of our investments are, in my estimation, asymmetric. There is a chance we may lose money, but there is a significant chance at a large profit, providing a positive expected value.When I say design matters, and who I spend our time with is important, I mean it. Under the umbrella of the Partners Fund, I am going to convene Annie Duke and the portfolio managers of the funds the Partners Funds is invested in. As I wrote in the invitation to the managers,The day with Annie Duke will be followed by a day of idea sharing among the managers. I don't know exactly what will come of these gatherings, but in my experience, good content and good people are a promising formula. While I believe our best chance at generating returns are with an investment committee of one, I am also keenly aware that the best chance of success will not be acting entirely alone. Rather, our best chances for success will be from the combination of the right limited partners, the right managers in the Partners Fund, and the right outside resources. The Annie Duke day will be another stop on that journey.We have a healthy economy and a portfolio of companies that have the opportunity for revenue growth, margin expansion, and multiple expansion over time. As volatility arises, I will attempt to take advantage of the opportunities it creates. We will continue to invest with a long-time horizon, and we will continue to invest like it is our own money - because it is. Thank you for the opportunity to grow your family capital alongside mine.Sincerely,Scott MillerEditor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

As airline and hotel management continue to preach about their digital success, expect OTAs to steadily derate because it's less likely they'll be acquired to fill a technological void.ContextThis chart explains why TRIP stock is up so much. Source: Q3 Earnings SlidesBased on the chart below, you can see TripAdvisor margin expansion has been idiosyncratic - and not due to some sectoral shift in profitability (such as from cheaper input costs from Google, for example). Source: Author based on 10k DataIn 2015, when TripAdvisor had similar profitability expansion and people got over their skis, it ended in tears. People conflate software like margin expansion with far more recurring revenue with internet margin expansion incorrectly. Internet margins are far more driven by paid search traffic and a content-driven K factor (i.e. if a lot of people share TripAdvisor links).Source: Author based on 10k DataGiven the bleak traction charts in the catalyst section, it's likely that we will see a repeat of disappointment rather than a regime shift into higher margins as the market seems to be expecting.Valuation Commentary:TripAdvisor is a hybrid between an internet company like Groupon or Yelp and an online travel agency (OTA). It’s heavily exposed to travel trends and benefits from cheaper and better digital customer acquisition.Considering profitable US-based internet companies in the travel/content space the following valuation table is relevant:Source: Author, based on FactSetTable below assumes a $35.65 share price and a revenue and margin miss as explored in the catalyst section: it is fair to say that our numbers would be conservative in the case of an earnings and sales miss as even at a $35.65 price, TRIP would still be relatively expensive given our assumptions, with a GARP score of -.64 (though less so than currently at -.83).Trade Construction:An outright short of TripAdvisor is appropriate given its lack of mobile traction or market share gains mitigating takeout risk. The current annual borrow cost for TripAdvisor is affordable at 2.15% for up to 1.4 million shares (Source: Interactive Brokers Loan Rates). For the 6-month short trade discussed, the borrow would add up to 1.075%.For outright shorts we need to discuss the primary ways that this trade could go wrong:Visualizing Risk RewardThis helps us frame different scenarios:However, given the unique outperformance of TripAdvisor and tendency of the stock to hover in price ranges - options could be a better expression for a fast and abrupt derating. This is especially true considering what appears to be declining travel demand could portend negatives for consumer confidence, which up until now has driven economic strength. This has the benefit of protecting the investor from takeout risk as well.A zero premium options trade where one sells 1 March TripAdvisor put at $55 to buy 2x as many March $50 puts appears appealing. This is because the $50-55 range is not triggered in any of the scenarios outlined in the risk reward table, largely because there are volatile expectations around management's commentary re: 2019 that make skew appealing to own. This trade structure is especially appealing to investors who believe there is more than 10% chance of a TRIP acquisition in the next 6 months.Factors that would cause us to re-evaluate our thesis strongly and cover shorts would be:"

The worldwide travel industry expenditure crossed the $5.3 trillion mark in 2017. TripAdvisor alone has generated $546 billion (or 10.3%) out of the total spending in 2017.Source: TripAdvisorTripAdvisor derived 72.3% of its revenue from the hotel in the nine months of fiscal 2018. TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction generated 45.9% of the revenue; TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription generated 18.2% of the revenue. Non-hotel revenue accounted for 27.7% of the total revenue.The U.S. contributed 56.4% of the total revenue in fiscal 2017.Comparing the revenue performance for the nine months and the full fiscal year:Sources: Company filings, authorAccording to Deloitte, US hotel gross bookings, airline revenue, and US cruise passengers have grown at an 8-year CAGR of 6%, 4.6%, and 2.2% through 2017, respectively. As per hotelmanagement.net, revenue per available room (RevPAR) has been projected to increase by 2.6% in 2019 by PwC and STR and Tourism Economics. Therefore, going by TripAdvisor's historical trend and industry expectations, I am expecting revenue growth of at least 2.3% between 2018 and 2022.Source: DeloitteCost of revenue includes direct costs, like ad serving fees, flight search fees, credit card fees, and data center costs. The direct costs rose by 19%, 4%, and 24%, respectively, in fiscals 2016, 2017, and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively. Therefore, I am expecting a cost growth rate of at least 5.3% in the subsequent years.The above explains the high gross margins of the company. The company has maintained a gross margin of 95%. Even if costs consume 6-7% of revenue, gross margins will range between 93% and 94%.Selling and marketing, technology and content and general and administrative expenses (G&A) formed the principal heads of the operating expenses. The expenses ate away 77-80% of revenue in fiscals 2016 and 2017. Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 9% in the nine months of fiscal 2018. Technology and content and G&A posted double-digit growth in the nine months of fiscal 2018. Therefore, I am expecting an operating cost margin of 75.4% (cost margin akin to nine months of fiscal 2018) for the subsequent years.Sources: Company filings, authorI expect the depreciation and amortization to a 7.1% of revenue just like fiscal 2017. If we keep the cost and expense margins of the nine months of fiscal 2018, we can expect an EBITDA and EBIT margin in the lines of 19% and 12%, respectively. The EBITDA margin dropped from ~22% to 15% between fiscals 2015 and 2017. The EBIT margin nearly halved from 15.5% in fiscal 2015 to 8% in fiscal 2017.The net interest expense as a percentage of revenue has been assumed at 0.7%, keeping in mind the historical trends. I am expecting a tax rate of 33% for the subsequent years.Sources: Company filings, authorAll the above have boiled down to a reduction in adjusted net margin from 20.2% in fiscal 2015 to 9.3% in fiscal 2017. My expectations have translated into a net margin of 7.7% for the subsequent years. The margin has also been affected by non-recurring items like stock-based compensation expense and income tax adjustments.The capital expenditure has been estimated at 3.5% of revenue as per the data for the nine months of fiscal 2018. The company generated free cash flow worth $174 million and $329 million in fiscal 2017 and the nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively. TripAdvisor has undertaken stock repurchases worth $250 million and $100 million in fiscal 2017 and the nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively.

They are the significant determinants of consumer spending. The travel industry will also continue to be driven by digital innovation.

4212755,104183,2018-10-19T12:11:08-04:00,"TripAdvisor is a buy on the dip as economic fundamentals continue to be supportive of the core business.Impressive growth stems from the non-hotel segment, however, it is EBITDA margin dilutive.The stock looks expensive to peers, but you're paying up for growth and a positively changing business mix.","TripAdvisor (TRIP) is an incredibly well-run business that's operating in a highly supportive fundamental environment and its idiosyncrasies help support an overall solid investment. The company’s large and prevalent platform is in the consumer’s daily view and continues to scale nearly two decades after being founded. This stock is geared towards late cycle macro and micro factors, but also highly sensitive to broader market sell-offs. Thus, investors need to approach dips with caution. However, at an undemanding valuation for the growth, I believe the most recent dip is a buying opportunity.Source: Downing CollegeOne of the things I think shareholders need to pay more attention to is the strategy shift away from hotels and towards non-hotels, which is attractions, restaurants, and vacation rentals. Hotel EBITDA is on the decline and has been prone to volatility in recent quarters, but is still the majority of revenue so it's correct for investors to spend a majority of their time evaluating this segment.Source: Investor PresentationYet, non-hotel revenue growth is the stronger side of the business and that's growing at a 22% YOY rate on a Q2 basis and a 28% YOY on a 1H basis. In fact, when it comes to profitability, non-hotels are accelerating. Non-hotel EBITDA growth in Q2 was up 18% YOY vs. 6% for hotels. The group level impact was +8% because of the mix being skewed towards hotels.Currently, hotels make up 72% of sales and 82% of EBITDA. However, it is worth noting that the non-hotel EBITDA margin is 17% relative to Hotel's 28% (combining for a group level margin of 25%). That means if the business mix shifts more towards non-hotels, it'll dilute the group level EBITDA margin, despite adding a diversification benefit.Both segments, fortunately, are geared to late cycle economics, especially global growth as dictated by GDP. Additionally, I think the microeconomic factors to right now, pay attention to are disposable income growth and wage growth in the United States. The revenue split by geography for TripAdvisor is 56.4% in North America, 30.2% in Asia Pacific, and 13.4% in EMEA, which is Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.As the majority, North America is really the key driver here (for which the United States is virtually all of the revenue in the North American segment) and as such, we’ll pay attention to the specific wage and income dynamics in that market.One way to look at a micro fundamental is to view US household debt to disposable income. Currently, it's at the lowest level since 2002 and has been on a steady ten-year downtrend. Until we see these indicators deteriorate, there is a positive economic basis for buying this stock. That means individuals in the US have more money to spend on incremental experiences, which leaves TripAdvisor well-positioned to capture the increase in spending.Source: Trading EconomicsIn terms of wage growth, investors should look at the Atlanta Fed Wage Growth tracker, which is a decent barometer for nationwide wage growth. As this index moves higher, the percentage of disposable income that Americans have also moves higher, all else equal. Wage growth peaked in late 2016 at around +4%, before trailing off into Q1 2018 below the 3% mark. Now, it’s started to reverse the near 18-month long trend and is currently tracking at +3.5%. This acceleration creates support for TRIP.Source: Trading EconomicsTripAdvisor has never paid a dividend and true to my investment process, this is something I count against companies, especially those with significant balances of free cash flow. In TripAdvisor’s case, there’s over 450 million monthly average users (MAUs), with over half of those on mobile. A higher mobile skew is the trajectory I’ll continue to look for. Additionally, it’s that user base’s engagement that really makes this platform valuable – and that can’t be said for every travel site.The company has 661 million reviews and opinions across millions of accommodations, travel activities and experiences, as well as restaurants, airlines and cruises. It’s safe to say that the scale built out already is a real competitive advantage for the company, especially considering the number of unique visitors is growing at a 14% CAGR over the last three years.Source: Investor PresentationOn the subject of group-level growth, what I think is interesting is the forward-looking consensus estimates for both the top and bottom line. Right now, for Q3 and Q4, the Street has the top line growth rate at 7.2% and 8.2%, respectively. Both of these are on a YOY basis. That represents a sequential acceleration from Q2, where revenue growth was just 2.1% YOY. Additionally, it’s an acceleration on a YOY basis where the comps were +4.3% and +1.6%, respectively. The Street is telling investors that they expect TRIP to have a strong quarter and to significantly improve upon last year’s results.On the bottom line, interestingly enough, the expectation is also for an acceleration of growth. However, the key thing to highlight here is that consensus is expecting more than a doubling of EPS on a YOY basis. This seems like a high bar to hit with the hotel segment (the higher EBITDA margin business) growing slower than the non-hotel segment (the lower EBITDA margin business). Now, these figures might not mean anything in a few weeks’ time as guidance, as well as an update on the status of the buyback, will be of material importance to shareholders who are diligently watching the current economic backdrop.TRIP is expensive if you are looking at this company on a relative valuation and that is a headwind if the high level of growth doesn’t remain intact. First, TRIP’s peers are all considerably larger than it and they are Expedia (EXPE) at a $17.7 billion market cap and Booking Holdings (BKNG) at $86 billion. Those companies should trade at a discount because of the sheer size. Next, on a P/E basis, TRIP trades at 29.7x forward earnings versus 19.6x for Expedia and 18.2x for Booking.TRIP also trades at premiums on both an EV/EBITDA basis and an EV/EBIT basis. On the former, TRIP’s multiple is 14.2x versus Booking’s 12.5x and Expedia’s 8.8x. On the latter, TRIP trades at 19.7x versus Booking’s 13.4x and Expedia’s 13.7x. However, I did find it interesting that on an EV/Sales basis, a more common metric to evaluate web-based businesses, TRIP actually trades at a discount to Booking. TRIP’s EV/Sales is 3.3x versus Booking’s 5x. Expedia trades at what arguably looks cheap at 1.5x EV/Sales.The stock has had a great run this year, up nearly 38%, even after last week’s sell-off. Despite the high trading multiples, investors are compensated by the company's strong growth profile. We’ve just kicked off earnings season and TripAdvisor is due to report on November 7th, which is just a few weeks out. It’s beat on the bottom line the last two reports and four out of the last five, which does leave me with a slightly higher confidence level as we get into year-end positioning.I think if the stock retakes its 200 DMA in the next few weeks, investors need to buy before the end of the year as the fundamentals are quite positive. Additionally, I don't see ample reason for the stock to move lower or any sort of negative catalyst as trade war concerns impacting travel websites look to be well priced into this year's trading performance.Source: StockChartsIt's also worth noting that the company is utilizing its free cash flow and continues to be optimistic. The company has an ongoing stock repurchase plan, with $250 million authorized and about $100 million of that already completed. Another $150 million bought back, perhaps across the second half of the year, as management might want to take advantage of the current dip, is another 2.5% of the market cap reduced. That's direct value to current shareholders just for owning the stock.TripAdvisor’s scale is a primary reason why I want to own this stock. Set against a backdrop of a growing $1.6 trillion global travel market that is increasingly focused on mobile, TRIP is well-positioned to not only maintain its current growth but accelerate and the wage fundamentals in the U.S. are supportive, as well. That's going to lead to a group-level EBITDA uplift and a more positive resonance with investors. I think the stock is a buy ahead of Q3 earnings, as well as ahead of year-end."
4221445,104659,2018-11-12T16:37:32-05:00,"TripAdvisor's growth in unique visitors and reviews is exemplary, but a poor business model has led to years of declining margins.Growth in its non-hotel segment finally means the company can transition towards more direct booking revenue and decrease its dependence on advertising from Booking.com and Expedia.With an enterprise value to revenues ratio of 5, single digit revenue growth, and low margins, the stock price is expensive.","It has been a bounce-back year for TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). Shares tanked last year and started rebounding last November. In 2018, the stock price has moved consistently higher.I purchased stock in the company somewhat impulsively about a year ago and luckily bought near the bottom. The stock recently gaped up significantly after strong earnings growth in the most recent quarter. I sold part of my position in October, and I'm planning on selling off part of my remaining position with the recent jump in the stock price.I admit I didn't do a lot of due diligence before buying it last year, so I've been watching the company closely in recent quarters. My view is some of the optimism is warranted, and the company is making progress in transforming its business model away from advertising from Expedia and Booking.com.That said, the valuation has gotten pricey, especially compared to Yelp, and the risk-reward has shifted as TripAdvisor is not trading at depressed levels anymore. With its global reach and continuing growth in visitors, the company is primed to better compete and grow its revenue and margins, but it will take time and isn't a sure thing.TRIP EV to Revenues (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsI've decided to sell most of my position with the hope of getting another opportunity to re-accumulate shares at lower prices. With still underwhelming profitability, the stock price is too expensive, but it's a stock I'm eager to hold long-term at the right price.With almost 500 million in total unique visitors in the recent quarter and 702 million reviews and opinions, TripAdvisor has a massive worldwide community and a base of reviews almost impossible for competitors to replicate. But financial results have been deteriorating over the years, as the company has done a poor job monetizing its user base. It has been and still is dependent on two advertising partners (Expedia and Booking Holdings) for a substantial portion of its revenue.Margins have been dropping precipitously for years, as management has failed to come up with a viable strategy to grow profits. Google increasingly started competing with the company in reviews, and direct booking companies have captured huge profits in the travel industry. Advertising for mobile users is much less profitable than for desktop users which has hurt TripAdvisor's business as well.TRIP Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsTripAdvisor's business model is not competitive and hasn't been for a long-time. The company is basically just an advertising platform for Expedia/Booking.com. Management ramped up its sales and marketing spending in an effort to stay competitive, which tanked profits and caused the stock price to go into a multi-year decline.The company thought it could buy growth through paid searches with Google. Especially since paid traffic tends to click on ads with a greater frequency than free traffic. But with Google moving into reviews and the pressure on margins, this was a terrible strategy.Disappointingly, the company tried to switch to more direct hotel bookings last year but failed and partially gave up on the effort. But, as has become increasingly apparent this year, growth in TripAdvisor's non-hotel segment provides a new opportunity to transition away from advertising to direct booking commissions.The non-hotel segment was over 33% of revenue in the most recent quarter and has grown at a rate of 24% so far this year. With hotel ad revenue struggling, this segment will continue to grow as a share of revenue. Crucially, TripAdvisor mostly generates revenue from commissions and there are more diversified potential advertisers from the non-hotel segment.Listings are consistently growing across all segments (hotels, experiences, restaurants, and rentals). TripAdvisor is increasingly monetizing new segments by leveraging its database of reviews, and its got the reach and audience to do it globally.The more comprehensive TripAdvisor's service is, the more useful it is to consumers. It's just easier if you can book all your activities, restaurants, hotels ect using one app, and the more the company's listings grow, the more attractive the service becomes. TripAdvisor's large unique visitor total can be increasingly leveraged to drive more growth in transactions. With its growth in areas like restaurants and experiences, it's a differentiated offering than sites like Booking.com, and its over 700 million reviews and opinions make it more informative to users than other sites.With gross margins close to 95%, TripAdvisor will have huge operating leverage with its marketing spending continuing to decline. The company decreased marketing expenses in the most recent quarter and for the year, but crucially unique visitors continued to grow strongly even with TripAdvisor's massive scale already.Management plans to increase television advertising as its paid search spending comes down. TripAdvisor clearly can't be reliant on Google long-term, and management sort of seems to realize this. This will keep margins down somewhat but may pay off in the long run. But with visitor growth so strong, it doesn't seem necessary to spend heavily on TV advertising.While competition is fierce, unlike Yelp, TripAdvisor has been able to build a user base internationally. This large user base crucially gives it a chance to compete with the bigger players, and it gives TripAdvisor a platform to drive its non-advertising revenue growth. Its success is far from certain though with intense competition in the travel market.Management is still focused on advertising, and with lower advertising monetization rates from mobile, growth doesn't have huge upside. The non-hotel segment, while having potential, is not big enough to drive strong revenue growth yet.As a travel-focused company, the transition to mobile greatly benefited its visitor growth; the tricky part is figuring out how to sustainably monetize this. Mobile is now 60% of the company's average unique visitors. If you're on a trip or just away from home, TripAdvisor becomes a very useful app in a way it couldn't be when users accessed its website solely through a desktop computer or laptop.The shift to mobile has hurt the company in the short-term but opened up new opportunities. As the non-hotel segment grows, TripAdvisor can increasingly leverage growth in the non-hotel segment to eventually convince customers to use its service for the direct booking of hotels. All of this will take time though, so I've decided to reduce my position given how stretched the valuation is. Margins should continue to improve, but that's more than priced into the stock currently."
4205259,101693,2018-09-10T10:07:49-04:00,"TripAdvisor business model still hinges on being an OTA. Nevertheless, its real value lies in its unique monthly users.TRIP has so far faced significant challenges in unlocking its true potential value. This is because as users switch to mobile, it's increasingly difficult to monetize them.Nevertheless, other platforms (like Facebook) have succeeded in this task. If TripAdvisor was to succeed as well, then its earnings potential would imply a much higher valuation.I believe that TRIP is currently priced as it will fail at fully monetizing its MAUs. This represents an opportunity for investors.","TripAdvisor (TRIP) is an exciting company. It was initially conceived as a disruptive travel platform. As the global online travel market matured (although it's still in its early stages), many other similar competitors tried to take its place. This resulted in TRIP morphing into a hybrid between a traditional OTA and an online travel forum. Currently, TRIP is without a doubt the best place to find reviews about different travel alternatives.Nevertheless, its stock valuation isn't as clear-cut. TRIP still faces monetization challenges before unlocking its true value potential. Hence, it's vital for investors to understand the TRIP's potential upside and downside before making an investment decision.Image: TRIP's logo.TRIP's business model can be summarized as a broker between travel supply and demand. Its platform allows potential travelers to personalize their search and find the best alternatives based on user-generated content (i.e., reviews). Then TRIP can directly link the user to the OTA/travel supplier website to finalize the transaction.However, it's difficult to monetize this dynamic. Brokers typically charge a commission for matching supply and demand of any good/service. TRIP profits from fees charged to OTAs through advertising, subscription, or commissions. These fees are capped because ultimately OTAs also profit from connecting the user to its end goal (hotel, car rental, flight seat, etc.). Hence, revenues from brokering deals between users and travel suppliers are spread over many different platforms. For instance, the user googles (GOOG/GOOGL) for flight alternatives and then arrives at TRIP's website, which then suggests an Expedia (EXPE) alternative that ultimately transacts with American Airlines (AAL). Notice that the user only pays for the flight seat, but in the process, many other companies brokered/facilitated the deal. The meta-commission that stems from these services is divided among all of these companies.Once you understand this dynamic, then figuring out TRIP is much easier. Henceforth, it becomes evident that its real value lies somewhere else other than being a simple online travel broker. Its real value is being the best online real estate property in the OTA market. TRIP's usefulness for travelers is unmatched and vastly exceeds every other OTA. This is because TRIP's user-generated content coupled with its search engine provides the user with the best travel information available.Source: TRIP's 2017 annual report.Because of this, every OTA has to cooperate with TRIP in one way or another. Booking Holdings (BKNG) and Expedia together represent more than 40% of TRIP's total revenues. This is huge, and it shows how valuable is TRIP's platform for providing travel alternatives to users. Booking Holdings and Expedia have a duopoly of the OTA market. If a significant portion of these companies' revenues depends on TRIP's referrals, then it's likely that other OTAs are in a similar position. Because of this, I think that TRIP is without a doubt the Times Square of the OTA market.As valuable as TRIP is to the OTA market, it does have its challenges. In my estimation, TRIP's problems are the following (from most to least dangerous):TRIP would be worth double or triple the current market capitalization if it were able to monetize its users as well as Facebook (FB). In the US, FB extracts as much as $26.76 per user of its platform. I'll delve into the implications of this figure for TRIP later in the article.Nevertheless, as more users transition towards mobile, the more difficult it becomes to monetize them. This is because there's less space available for ads (and features) in mobile than desktop. As you might expect, the bare bones version of TRIP in mobile produces fewer profits.Source: TRIP's 2017 annual report plus author's annotations.Also of worry is the fact that TRIP's user traffic appears to depend on marketing spending. More importantly, it looks like marketing spending is growing faster than revenues for the past three years. This signals that more players are bidding for the same types of ads that TRIP requires for user growth. This dynamic translates into weaker margins for the company.Source: Statista plus author's annotations.The rest of the risks are also important but, in my view, less vital. Google is a formidable competitor, but its business revolves around profiting from data with its search engine. TRIP's business hinges on user-generated content regarding travel alternatives on its platform. In my view, building social networks is outside Google's circle of competence. Thus, TRIP's reviews are its competitive advantage over Google in the OTA market. Finally, TRIP's macro risks (currency and recessions) are important but out of control for investors. Moreover, I think that overall, the potential size of the global online travel market and its potential growth compensates for these exogenous risks.TRIP's platform has millions of monthly users, and it's well suited to produce advertising revenues. Thus, TRIP profits from advertising rather than OTA activities. In this line of thinking, we could value TRIP based on its most important asset: Its monthly active users (MAUs).Facebook manages to extract more than $6 in revenues per user (worldwide average). This is a quarterly figure. Thus, we only need to know how many monthly users TRIP has and multiply it times 6 to have an approximation to what TRIP could produce in quarterly revenue.Source: TRIP's 2017 annual report, plus author's annotations.By December 2017, TRIP was able to have up to 455 million unique visitors. These could be interpreted as 455 million MAUs. Hence, if TRIP were to be as good as Facebook is at monetizing its MAUs, then TRIP could produce up to $2.73 billion in quarterly revenue.If these numbers seem too good to be true, is because they are. You see, it's unrealistic to expect TripAdvisor to monetize its MAUs as well as Facebook. However, even if it's 25% as good as FB, then its potential upside would still be 41% (or priced at $71.13 per share). You can play around with the numbers yourself. Nevertheless, the takeaway here is that TRIP still has room to grow.TRIP still hasn't unlocked its true value. Hence, it's currently priced as if it's never going to overcome its challenges. Monetizing mobile users is difficult, but not impossible. Mobile apps can be incredibly profitable if they apply the precise mix of subscriptions, premium content, recurrent ads, and other types of additional purchases (like coupons or travel bundles). As it stands, TRIP has a potential gold mine in its 455 million monthly users. All it needs to do is to find a way to monetize it better. TRIP's current discount implies that it'll fail at this and stagnate as a result. However, if they succeed, investors would be nicely rewarded. Because of this, I believe that TRIP currently offers a compelling risk/reward profile.Thank you for reading and good luck."

WeWork gets $1B: WeWork (VWORK) secured a $1B investment from SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBF, OTCPK:SFTBY). The disclosure happened in the co-working company’s first financial presentation, which happened due to the spring bond sale. The company remains in talks with other potential investors for an additional $1B with a $42B valuation float. WeWork continues to march towards a 2019 IPO.  WeWork’s 1H18 losses tripled Y/Y to $723M with revenue run rate of $1.8B (up from $1.5B at end of Q1). SoftBank’s latest investment, structured as a convertible note,  brought the existing cash pile and commitments up to $4B. The company plans to use the funds for overseas expansion, building office space, and acquiring new properties and leaseholds.   Uber trucking competitor: Chinese truck-hailing platform Manbang Group is seeking $1B in new funding, according to WSJ sources. Previous backers include SoftBank and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) with Manbang currently approaching U.S.-based mutual funds and late-stage investors. The new cash would push Manbang to a $10B valuation.  Manbang Group’s mobile app matches merchants to truckers to transport cargo and also offers stored-value toll cards, diesel cards, and member financing. As of June, about 3.1M truckers logged into the app at least once a month, up 36% on the year. The company will use the new funds to expand in China. Sources suggest Manbang is also building up cash for some domestic acquisitions perhaps in the field of autonomous trucking.  Competition: Uber Freight, which is undergoing a structural overhaul as Uber doubles its investments in the unit.  EBay competitor: Naspers (NPSND, OTCPK:NPSNY) provided $500M in funding for used goods app marketplace LetGo. Valuation was sitting at around $1.5B before the newest infusion. Previous backers have included Accel, Insight Venture Partners, and Eight Roads Ventures.  LetGo says the app has passed 100M downloads and 400M listings in total with monthly listers up 65% YTD. Message metrics include 13M messages sent daily and 6B total since the opening three years ago. The business is primarily based in the U.S. and Spain (through a merger with local startup Wallapop).  Competition: EBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Craigslist, and OfferUp, to name a few.  Increased Slack: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams competitor Slack is reportedly raising at least $400M on a $7B+ valuation. TechCrunch sources say General Atlantic is leading the round with Dragoneer among the backers.  Slack recently passed 8M daily active users with 3M paying subscribers. The company has 70K paid enterprise teams including Capital One, IBM, and eBay and 65% of the Fortune 100. Slack recently bought and closed competitor HipChat from Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) in exchange for a Slack stake.  Competition: Microsoft, which reported 200K paying Teams organizations earlier this year, recently launched a free tier to take on Slack and Facebook launched Workplace.  Travel experience platform: TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) and Airbnb (AIRB) competitor Klook raised $200M from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Boyu Capital, TCV, Sequoia China, Matrix Partners, and OurCrowd. Total fundraising now totals $296.5M. Klook declined to provide its valuation.  Hong Kong-based Klook will use the funding to move into the U.S. and European markets. The company’s platform sells travel experiences and attraction tickets and Klook says it’s on track for $1B in bookings this year. Klook is available across Asia with Greater China serving as the largest market. Klook plans to open its first U.S. office by the end of the year.  DDR cancer treatment: Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) Ventures, Novartis (NYSE:NVS) Venture Fund, and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Ventures participated in a $84M Series B round in Artios Pharma, developer of DNA Damage Response treatments for cancer. Andera Partners and Life Sciences Partners led the round with participation from Arix Bioscience, SV Health Investors, M Ventures, and IP Group. The round brought total funding up to about $115M.  Artios treatments target tumors where DNA damage response factors have been lost or down regulated, which can selectively kill cancer cells without harming normal cells. The treatments can also potentially work well in combination therapies with existing treatments. You can find the current Artios pipeline here.  Competition: Sierra Oncology (NASDAQ:SRRA) is also working on DDR cancer therapies.  CNS gene therapy: Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRPT) made a $30M equity investment in gene therapy company Lacerta, which was spun out from the University of Florida. The investment gave Sarepta exclusive rights to central nervous system-targeted gene therapy for the metabolic disorder Pompe Disease and two unnamed programs for other rare CNS disease. Sarepta will take over once clinical testing starts in the programs.  Sarepta committed to paying Lacerta development and sales-based milestones plus single-digit royalties on net sales. Lacerta gained access to Sarepta’s talent, dosing and delivery platform, capsid screening library, and manufacturing technology. Sarepta got to add three gene therapies to the existing eight programs. Competition: Avrobio (NASDAQ:AVRO) and Audentes Therapeutics (NASDAQ:BOLD) are among the companies working on gene therapies for Pompe Disease.

(TRIP) has been a victim of the global coronavirus pandemic. With travel and tourism shut down, the business here is a sitting-duck until conditions can normalize and the virus outbreak contained so that travelers can book vacations and return to normality. Recognizing the disastrous near-term outlook for the company, we think there will be an eventual recovery once the travel industry resumes. The silver lining here is that TripAdvisor maintains a solid balance sheet with no outstanding long-term debt which is a valued quality in this market environment. We see upside in the stock from current levels with potentially most of the worst-case scenarios already priced in.(Source: finviz.com)From the chart above, it's clear there has been a long-term downtrend in the stock since reaching $100 back in 2014. TRIP is down by over 80% from its all-time high, including a 50% drop this year with the ongoing pandemic. The story in recent years has been overall disappointing growth amid intense competition from various rivals compared to stronger momentum in the first half of the last decade.In 2019, TripAdvisor made progress towards greater efficiency with an internal reorganization, including cost-cutting initiatives to focus on profitability. While total revenues declined by 3% compared to 2018, net income climbed 12% and reached $126 million supported by higher margins and strong cash flow. EPS for the year reached $1.77 from $1.71 in 2018.(Source: Company IR)By focusing on its strength as a trip-planning site, more than simply a place to buy tickets and book a hotel room, TripAdvisor has secured a niche in the travel-booking industry. The core business here is advertising for hotels that partner with the website to highlight offerings along with a transaction level commission. Separately, the main site includes guides and a review ecosystem that travelers value for the destination in sight. The brand's ""category of one"" theme to compare prices on hotels, flights, cruises, tours, and attractions is a differentiator.(Source: Company IR)A growth initiative has been a push towards restaurant reservations across various subsidiary websites like the UK's ""TheFork.com."" Overall, TripAdvisor holds a portfolio of over 20 different travel-related domains with different market share levels across regions. In 2019, the ""experiences and dining"" segment saw strong growth, up 23% y/y, and now represents 28% of the business.(Source: Company IR)With global air travel, tourism, and restaurants shut down, the unimaginable situation brings the entire business to nearly a halt. TripAdvisor has already pulled full-year guidance while acknowledging the situation continues to develop rapidly. Management maintains a more optimistic view of the long-term viability of the business once the virus can be contained. From the press release: The key point here is that the final financial result to the business this year remains unknown as there is significant uncertainty in regards to the timetable for the course of the outbreak. That being said, at least for Q1, it's likely most of January and the first half of February were business as usual given the outbreak situation only began to deteriorate in the latter half of the month.We assume the Q2 quarter will generate only a minimal level of booking transactions through April. Some of the existing advertising revenues and travel reviews on site will support some cash flow. In terms of operating expenses, it's possible TripAdvisor reduces its own level of marketing for a few weeks during this time which could limit overall operating expenses. Nevertheless, we expect a loss for the full year 2020.Recognizing the unprecedented situation, there is still a consensus that the virus will be contained, and people will eventually return to normal daily activities later this year. Whether that occurs in a few weeks or a few months, we expect the global travel industry to begin a recovery process and TripAdvisor will be well-positioned to benefit from those trends. There is a thought that some pent-up demand among portions of consumers for vacations and tourism (beyond simply being quarantined) can lead to a surge in activity when the virus threat is eliminated.The strength of the TripAdvisor business comes down to its balance sheet that ended 2019 with a cash and equivalents position of $319 million and no outstanding debt. This condition means the company can better manage the near-term challenges without worrying about liquidity concerns. The company also maintains a revolving credit facility of $1.2 billion that should cover any liquidity needs. For context, total operating expenses in Q4 of 2019 were $312 million suggesting its cash position could cover an entire quarter of costs.We highlight that TripAdvisor's balance sheet position is stronger compared to larger-competitors Expedia Group, Inc. (EXPE) and Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG). EXPE and BKNG reported long-term debt of $4.9 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively. The two companies have a debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.3x and 1.3x, compared to 0.0x for TRIP.Data by YChartsIn the current market environment, with businesses shut down, a trend has been the relative underperformance of companies that are leveraged that will need to cover in some cases significant interest expenses. Indeed, EXPE with its higher leverage to the group has underperformed year to date 2020, and down by 57% compared to a 41% decline in TRIP.In terms of valuation metrics based on 2019 earnings, we like TRIP's price to free cash flow multiple of 6.8x, considering it generated $341 million in free cash flow last year. TRIP has traded at a premium to EXPE and BKNG, evident from its current P/E multiple of 18.5x compared to 13.7x for EXPE and 10.5x for BKNG. We think this is a well-deserved quality premium.Data by YChartsKeep in mind that TRIP was trading at an average P/E ratio of 35x in 2019, highlighting the upside should growth recover. With any earnings expectation for 2020 off the table, we can look forward to 2021 to a process that could begin normalizing its operating and financial conditions.The risk here is that conditions can deteriorate even further and there are growing concerns of a longer-lasting economic slowdown. In this scenario, the operating environment and earnings potential of the company will be lower in the future. Even with a reset of expectations, we think TripAdvisor with its differentiated brand and model can maintain and grow its market share.The challenges facing the travel industry and TripAdvisor this year are significant. Still, we are hopeful and optimistic that the eventual containment of the coronavirus pandemic will lead to a recovery for the travel industry as consumers return to a normal daily life. The company's solid balance sheet represents strength and quality during this time and a positive in its investment profile.We rate shares of TRIP as a buy, considering the extended selloff already pricing in some of the worst-case scenarios leading to a more favorable valuation on long-term prospects. Investors interested in the stock should consider taking only a small position with an expectation that the market environment will remain volatile for an extended period."

The growth is attributed to improvements in ease of bookings, safer online payment methods, and availability of multiple choices and comparison options. Travel booking giant TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) recently reported results that beat estimates.TripAdvisor recently reported its first quarter results that surpassed market expectations. Revenues for the quarter grew 2% over the year and 18% over the quarter to $378 million, ahead of analyst estimates of $361 million. Adjusted first quarter earnings of $0.09 per share also were better than the Street's forecast of $0.05 per share.By segment, revenues from the hotel segment fell 5% over the year to $299 million. Revenues from the non-hotel segment increased 37% to $79 million.By source, revenues from click-based advertising fell 10% over the year to $189 million. Revenues from display-based advertising increased 9% to $71 million and the other hotel revenue grew 3% to $39 million.Among operating metrics, user reviews grew 26% to 630 million. Average monthly unique visitors grew 12% to nearly 433 million and average monthly unique hotel shoppers were flat at 149 million.Based on the solid start to the year 2018, the company now expects to deliver year-over-year consolidated adjusted earnings growth in 2018 and is incrementally positive about its revenue prospects.The market was pleased with TripAdvisor's results, and the stock soared nearly 20% post the result announcement.Till recently, TripAdvisor has had a rocky performance. The company, which went public in 2013, has seen its stock price sink primarily due to its failure to keep up with changing traveler habits and increasing competition from the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The recent results suggest that the company may be slowly making a change for the better.It recently expanded its monetization capabilities by expanding into the non-hotel business segment, which includes restaurant and event booking. The robust growth reported in this segment in the quarter was attributed to these experiences. The company has been adding more attractions and restaurants as part of this offering. It also recently announced the acquisition of Bokun, a software-as-a-service business software for tour operators and experiences that will help it deliver improved traveler experience by adding more inventory. Iceland-based Bokun will help TripAdvisor manage booking, inventory, and tour operations. Bokun was founded in 2012 and is a leading player in Iceland and beyond. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.To drive higher monetization, TripAdvisor also launched sponsored ads on its website. These ads will allow hotel companies and restaurants to get prominent placements on the home pages for a city or region that the viewer is researching. Termed sponsor placement, the ads are doing good business.The market is pleased with TripAdvisor's resurgence. Its stock is currently trading at $50.65 with a market capitalization of $6.97 billion. It recently touched a 52-week high of $50.69 and has recovered from the 52-week low of $29.50 that it had fallen to in November last year."
4185065,47521,2018-07-02T10:02:25-04:00,"This booking and review company has more gas left in the tank.In the short term, it should get support from shorts having to cover their positions.Further out, its rapidly growing mobile and non-hotel businesses will produce sustainable growth.Loyal user base and mobile more resistant to Google threat than market gives it credit for.Why its hotel business is poised to return to profitability.","Source: TripAdvisorTripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has been on a tear in 2018, with most of that coming from May 1, 2018 onward, where it briefly surpassed the $60 per share mark. Since then it has pulled back some, as the shorts started piling in, responding to its soaring share price, along with apparent skepticism surrounding its value.Based upon the latest earnings report which showed improvement in its hotel business for the second quarter in a row, its improved desktop-to-mobile ratio, and a rapidly growing attractions business, I think the next earnings report will reinforce its turnaround is sustainable, and the shorts will continue to scramble to cover their positions; something I think some are already doing. That is likely to result in a short-term positive catalyst.And if the company does report another decent quarter, that momentum should continue on. It's unlikely we'll see a big surge like we did in May and June, but it should settle down into more decent growth as the market starts to better understand what will drive growth over the long term.Even better, this is a high-margin business, which throws off a lot of free cash flow. Assuming it maintains that performance, future growth will directly positively impact its bottom line and cash position.After its recent upward run, the market sentiment has been falling. I think the market has it wrong, and that will be confirmed in the next earnings report.In the last earnings report, management reported the engagement of its loyal user base improved, with the community increasing the number of reviews and opinions to 630 million, up 26 percent, with its monthly user base climbing to 433 million, a gain of 12 percent. That was driven a lot by the growth in the use of mobile devices, which now accounts for over 50 percent of its user base.One thing naysayers point out is users doesn't necessarily translate into revenue and earnings growth. While partly true, it would be disingenuous to suggest that most of these engaged users only access TripAdvisor for advice and info, and then use another service or means of making reservations. Some of course will do that, but the growth in mobile and attractions shows many of its user base go with TripAdvisor after checking out reviews and opinions on the site.The strong user base of TRIP, along with its move to mobile with its hotel business, means it lessens its risk exposure to Google, which many believe could be disruptive to its business model.With the company lowering ad spend and doing better than expected in the last quarter, it appears it is in fact less exposed to Google with its loyal user base and transition to mobile than before the company took that step.If TripAdvisor can continue to improve the user experience and keep them on the app, it has a much stronger competitive position against Google than the market gives it credit for.In the last earnings release, the company revealed the ongoing pace of growth in its non-hotel business, which includes things like reservations for restaurants and tours.Sequentially, growth in the quarter was up 36 percent, up from the 20 percent growth in the prior quarter. As for experiences within the portfolio, that surpassed the 100,000 market, an increase of 86 percent year over year.While the segment lost money in the quarter, it has been trending toward strong improvement. That's why even though sales were up a very modest 2 percent in the last quarter, and earnings plunged to $5 million, the market rewarded it so strongly.What is happening now is the market has apparently decided TripAdvisor has received all the momentum it's going to for now, which is why those shorting the stock have increased recently.But since the fundamentals remain in place, nothing has changed since the last report, which is why I expect shorts to start covering their positions as the next earnings report gets closer in August, and it's likely to enjoy a short-term boost. If the report confirms the growth levers remain in place, it's probably going to get a further increase in price from investors.The experiences and restaurants is the major driver of growth for the company, but with the scale of its mobile business rising quickly, it's only a matter of time before its hotel business returns to profitability on a consistent basis.It's no secret that the hotel business has been under pressure because of the transition to mobile by consumers, which only commands about 20 percent of the rate of revenue desktop generated.When asked about the gap between desktop and mobile, CFO Ernst J. Teunissen said the company has been closing the gap.He said this:He went on to note that while desktop was down, RPS improvement on mobile for the reporting period exceeded 20 percent. Teunissen sees a lot of improvement in the second half of 2018, and eventually a crossover point in the near future.The significance of that as it relates to the hotel business is eventually the growth in mobile revenue will surpass the decline in revenue associated with desktop. That means the hotel segment will start to grow once again.When combined with the fast-growing non-hotel segment, it bodes well for the company.At this time, the monetization of mobile is approximately 50 percent of desktop.The non-hotel businesses and the continuing migration to mobile by consumers provide a good opportunity from the point of view of margins. The growth in its attractions and restaurants businesses represent wide margin sales which the company believes it can sustainably generate in a range of ""mid-to-high 20s% EBITDA margins."" It also sees ""very healthy P&Ls"" as a result of that.With the scalability inherent in the cost structure, it appears TripAdvisor has the ability to meet those margin expectations, and possibly exceed them. This would further add to its already robust free cash flow.As restaurants and experiences or attractions become a larger part of the product mix of TripAdvisor, it's going to surprise a lot of the market. What it's doing is working hard on creating a wider variety of choices for consumers to book, which, with its loyal and large user base, should translate into more sales.The major caveat to the performance of the company will be when the next recession hits. The industry it competes in is especially susceptible to decline because consumers and companies tend to cut those expenses from their budgets before most others. I don't see that being a factor over the next couple of years, so TripAdvisor should continue to do well. Further out, a recession will have to be factored into the performance of the company. As in the last quarter, there is little in the way of expectations concerning TripAdvisor because of its fall from its past lofty heights, but I see the company being underappreciated because the market still puts more weight on the performance of its hotel unit, rather than on the rapidly growing attractions and restaurant division.Taking into account the improving mix of mobile versus desktop, the company continues to have the pieces in place to surprise the market. I think the next couple of quarters at least it's going to do just that.For those reasons, I think it has another strong possibility of getting another strong boost once its next earnings report is released, and further out, should enjoy sustainable long-term growth."
4174798,101543,2018-05-16T14:45:09-04:00,"Investors have finally realized the value of the non-hotel business segment.Strong revenue growth from the non-hotel segment correlated into a higher stock price.Fair value estimates still show some value is still there.Fair value estimates could be considered conservative, especially to a strategic buyer.","Lately, I feel like I've been highlighting companies with multi-line businesses that aren't being properly valued. TripAdvisor (TRIP) is similar within this framework and just reported its earnings. It does seem now the narrative for the company has changed a bit and investors see the value in the non-hotel business segment. This segment still has a long runway which I thought would be a good time to update my valuation on and provide some commentary.Attractions TAM= $110 billion (Source: Phocuswright)The attractions sub-segments have been undeserved from a technology prospective. Penetration within these groups should continue and monetization will come.It all started for this sub-segment in 2014 when TripAdvisor purchased Viator. Travelers through viator.com or tripadvisor.com/tripadvisor app are able to book attractions and get perks along with it, like skipping lines. The main source of revenue generation is like OTAs for the hotel business, it charges a commission to the vendor if booked through their platform. It's been sourced that these commissions are around 20%. With the purchase of Viator came the supply side of 20,000 bookable attractions. TripAdvisor was already generating demand through reviews.Exhibit 1: Flywheel Network EffectSource: Author's WorkThe network effect is real and is the source of its moat. Platform businesses have a winner take all dynamic and this sub-segment is accomplishing just that.The platform already drives a lot of reviews and traffic to their website or app. So, the drivers I see for revenue generation on the attractions segment is the continuation of adding supply (bookable attractions) and conversion rates.Exhibit 2: Bookable Attractions GrowthSource: Investor Presentations, Author's WorkAs more adoption and consumer habits change to booking online for attractions - conversion rates should improve.If investors read through the quarterly remarks, you definitely get the sense that the attraction and restaurant segments are the two important sources of revenue and growth within the non-hotel business. Estimated portion of the non-hotel revenue, for the attractions is 40%-50%. Using a 12x EBITDA multiple, multiple EBITDA margin scenarios, and multiple revenue growth scenarios over a 5-year time horizon, we can establish a fair value.Exhibit 3: Fair Value Estimate AttractionsSource: Author's WorkEven with a wide range, the items highlighted in green I believe represent a good underwriting estimate of the fair value for the attractions part.In 2014, TripAdvisor also purchased lafourchette, an online restaurant reservation business with 12,000 bookable. This was the starting point for growth. TripAdvisor brought capital and already established traffic.Revenue GenerationJust by reviewing the pricing, logically you can see management will be more focused on Seated Diner fees. As a platform business, a per fee generation strategy makes more sense. These are the fees collected for diners booking reservations through the platform. Example, a four person reservation booked through the platform generates 8 euros. The platform has the potential to be very lucrative as scale is establish - incremental margins can be close to 100%. I have no data on the customer acquisition cost side, but once this customer is on the platform and is actively using it, very little cost will be incurred for the additional bookings made in the future.Bookable restaurants will be a key data point to follow. The more restaurants on the platform only adds fuel to the network and drives user growth. Management hasn't disclose seated diner numbers, but growth has been healthy. Bookable restaurants reached ~4.6 million as of 1Q 2018.Using some key data points and best estimates by correlating Trips restaurant segment with the OpenTable transaction should provide a fair value.Exhibit 4: Fair Value Estimate Restaurants Source: Author's WorkAll these valuations could be conservative when considering OpenTable take out EV/EBITDA multiple was somewhere in the 40/50x range. Since then, goodwill impairments have occurred, making the multiple possibly not a good data point.I'm going to spend very little time on the vacation rental business, as it generates the least amount of revenue and is estimated to be the slowest growing. Using very similar analysis above, a conservative fair value for the sub-segment is $2-3 per share.Exhibit 5: Sum-of-the-parts Non-hotel BusinessSource: Author's WorkThe $17-$30 per share value estimate is wide ranging, it does give a good sense of multiple scenarios. Lots of value has been created from the non-hotel segment in a short period of time.Just to bring everything together, I derived at multiple fair value scenarios for the hotel segment. Bear case assumes (1%) growth, base case is flat, and bull case is 1%.Exhibit 6: Fair Value Estimate Hotel SegmentSource: Author's WorkNow that we have fair values for all lines of businesses, we can generate a sum-of-the-parts for the whole business. By reviewing the multiple scenarios of the non-hotel segment valuations, a lot of the numbers used were very conservative and fair value ranges from $22-25 per share. I'll use $29 of fair value for the hotel segment, which is in line with the base case valuation.Exhibit 7: TripAdvisor Fair Value EstimateSource: Company Reports, Author's WorkInvestors are starting to change their perspective on the value drivers for TripAdvisor. The non-hotel business segment is starting to contribute meaningful growth and is operating in a less crowded space as of now, especially in the attractions sub-segment. It's interesting to see a platform operating multiple sub-segments creating mini network effects within different industries. After the last quarter earnings, strong momentum within the stock price reduced the margin of safety from my fair value estimates. I was a share gatherer when share prices were in the $30s to low $40. For now, I'm a holder and intrigued what the next quarter will bring. My estimates could be considered conservative if a strategic buyer ever does come into the picture.To read more research on stock spin-offs, micro-mid cap companies, and special situations please consider following me (by clicking the ""Follow"" button at the top of this article next to my name) to receive notification when I publish research next."
4174655,21815,2018-05-16T11:34:15-04:00,"With all the potential of a platform business model and the large amount of users TripAdvisor always had enormous potential.But the company hasn't done too well yet, struggling to find the right formula.But the latest quarter shows signs of gradual improvements and some parts of the business which are actually taking off.","We wrote about TripAdvisor (TRIP) almost a year ago when the company was struggling to turn its really well-visited website into a bookings platform in order to monetize all that traffic.This has always been the basic problem for the company: how to monetize the millions that visit their website in order to read reviews about destinations and hotels and what not, but then book their trip elsewhere.It's has also been a bit of a conundrum for investors, at least for us. We do happen to like these platform businesses a lot and if you look at valuations, many investors seem to agree.Here you have one of the biggest, if not the biggest (depending on metric) tourism platforms, a big industry with stable growth, but still it is struggling to fine-tune its business model, which will put it on a solid growth path.In principle, this should be a great business as a platform gathering so many eyeballs should have multiple ways of monetizing it, as in these situations, there are usually economics of scale and scope and network economics. The latter is visible in one of the earnings slides:But in their efforts of monetizing the platform, there have been mishaps on the way. For instance, the company never really got off the ground with their own booking systems through a combination of sub-par execution and upsetting partners.As you can see, revenue growth has declined and operational results have faltered, even if the company still produces a significant amount of EBITDA (and these are GAAP figures).But things improved in the recent quarter, which was a pleasant surprise:There are several new growth areas, two in particular:The sponsored products really is a logical thing to do for a platform attracting so many eyeballs, especially a trusted platform like TripAdvisor, where people come who haven't yet made up their minds. From management (Q1CC):Of course, big data can fine-tune the calibration here, making these sponsored products potentially very effective and increasing their click-through rates. Management thinks this can be quite big in a few years but they're just starting out.The non-hotel segment grew at 36% in Q1 y/y and will become 25%-30% of revenues this year.Attractions and restaurants (rentals are not growing) have taken off in earnest. Attractions supply grew at 80% y/y and management expects that torrid pace to continue on the basis of ""a host of investments they already have in place.""One problem is that lots of these attractions aren't yet bookable online but the acquisition of Bokum makes this considerably easier. Management expects this segment to deliver mid-to-high 20s EBITDA margins.Management argues that a turnaround in its hotel shopper, its hotel booking system is in the cards. This isn't yet visible in revenues, but revenue per hotel shopper is improving.However, the company is hobbled by the shift from desktop to mobile, and the significant, albeit closing gap between mobile and desktop. Management argued (Q1CC):But they haven't yet reached that crossover point where the mobile shift isn't as much as a headwind. Besides the move to mobile, another headwind is lower bids from hotels but at least that's not worsening.There has also been a turnaround of sorts in margins:One of the things they're going to do better is target users. In the past they were just maximizing clicks, but that wasn't necessarily maximizing bookings. Now, with the help of client data, the company is actually more focused on the latter, and that seemed to have worked.Of course, more bookings (at the client's site) will increase the company's CPCs, and with the help of that client data they can fine-tune marketing spend from a ROS perspective.Data allows further optimization of course, seemingly simple stuff like when a hotel that a customer wants to book turns out to be fully booked, provide the client with a meaningful alternative. The company is doing stuff like this, which is perhaps part of the 'holistic experience.'Management argued during the Q1CC that it was creating a holistic end-to-end user experience and a seemingly bemused analyst asked for details. This is what management responded (Q1CC):Suspense indeed, but perhaps this is one of these cases where a picture says more than words:And indeed, there is a lot to be said for this as TripAdvisor has a lot of functionality:And one of the things a platform with so many users as TripAdvisor should be able to take advantage of is to gather lots of data which enables this personalization, or 'holistic' experience, so we will be following with some interest what new initiatives the company will unfold and are mildly optimistic here.Has the downtrend been broken? It's early days and one quarter doesn't constitute a trend, but it's nice to see an uptick nevertheless.The company has $650M in (mainly) cash and short-term investments and no debt, although the cash part ($635M) is down from last year ($731M).We're pleasantly surprised that despite the climb in share-based compensation, there is no dilution. In fact, a significant buy-back program has bought the share count down quite a bit recently:Valuation has gone down and the company produced a GAAP loss, but in principle, an EV/S of 3.8 for a platform business isn't terribly expensive.Analysts expect a non-GAAP EPS of $1.15 this year rising to $1.33 in 2019, which does produce a considerable multiple.This must be one of the hardest companies to get one's head around. Having a trusted platform, with all the potential benefits that allows (economies of scale, scope, network, amass and use big data, stickiness, etc.) especially as large a platform as TripAdvisor, is potentially very powerful.Yet growing and monetizing this platform has been more difficult than many investors hoped, and although the recent quarter shows some promising green shoots, the company still has got a lot to prove.We're mildly optimistic management is on the right track now, and shareholders will finally benefit but we can imagine not everybody will be jumping to get on board right away."

From the Q2 Prepared Remarks:Improvement, but still contraction. One of the main problems is that this community has shifted in large numbers to mobile, where the click-through booking numbers are a lot lower.Well, there is good and bad news here:Given what we said about the use of Big Data, machine learning and precise targeting, we were quite baffled by the following (Q2CC):Overall, marketing declined by 10%, but the TV expenditure in Hotels and overall marketing for non-Hotels are actually growing, so there was considerable decline in online Hotel marketing.Again, that's a surprise to us. Online is where they can use Big Data and algorithms for precise and programmatic ad targeting and TV ads are of the scatter gun variety which tend to be inefficient.Management did provide an explanation as it argues that the branding advertisement of TV (rather than the performance management online) is what they need a little more for stuff like general awareness that TripAdvisor can be used for things like comparing prices.What seems to be the problem is that they have to educate their site visitors as the site offers more opportunities than many seem to be aware off. Not just comparing prices, but there is a whole gamut of services the site offers across a trip, and most of these still start with the Hotel shopper.Management argues that there are still some more of these marketing efficiencies to be realized, and they will still continue with their TV marketing 'education' drive (Q2CC):Like we noticed above, there was a downside and an upside to this (Q2CC):Revenue per shopper was up so the overall impact was positive. More positive is that this improvement came from mobile, not desktop, which was flat. But even that was better than one might realize at first (Q2CC):But some analysts weren't entirely taken in by this and wondered whether the fall in revenue from Hotel shopper wasn't a sign of something else (besides the marketing cutbacks to improve efficiencies) going on like a shift to other hotel shopping channels or Google.Management argues that they expect growth to return in Q3 or Q4 and they have a host of initiatives in development to further growth.Good growth continued, mobile RPS (revenue per hotel shopper) was up 17% y/y and it now constitutes 50% of Hotel shopper revenue. However, the monetization gap with desktop made little further headway, still stuck at roughly 40%.Yet, management still sees upside for the latter as people become more comfortable buying things on their mobile phones.This part is growing nicely with restaurants, experiences and vacation home rentals as the main categories. Experiences is actually the biggest of these, generating 50% of revenues in 2017 (the latest for which break-out data is available). From the Q2 Prepared Remarks:There was some slowdown, but management blamed this simply on a difficult comp and quarterly lumpiness, as the underlying bookings growth held up much better.Revenues can vary and be dependent on changed behavior of their OTA (online travel agency) clients leading to variation in auction rates, CPCs (as happened in the second half of last year) and hence revenue per shopper.In order to combat that variability and create an additional revenue stream, the company started media products, PR sponsored ads for hotels and restaurants, and launched these at a global level, tapping into their overall traffic.It also provides a way for the company to monetize their Big Data trove through these sponsored ads, which allows restaurants and hotels to target themselves into consideration for potential clients searching, and (needless to say) the ads are fine-tuned on the available data. The company is considering rolling this feature out to experiences.We think this is potentially a very interesting avenue for growth here, not just for searching results, but for the review pages which are exploding in number.One would be inclined to think they have an enormous inventory; combined with the even bigger data trove, there should be plenty of monetization opportunities here and we're surprised it hardly got a mention on the CC.Well, the changes in their marketing campaign, cutting out inefficiencies, did reduce revenue growth in the Hotel sector, but it did improve margins as well. From the earnings deck:TRIP Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsWe have seen much better times with regards to cash flows in the past, but then again, we've also seen much better times in the stock price even though much of that has recovered already.But, as we have discussed above, the marketing efforts are targeting increased profitability, even if this comes at the expense of some revenue growth (as we witnessed in the Hotels segment this quarter). This should also boost cash flows.However, keep in mind (Q2CC):A good part of the cash flow comes from stock-based compensation, but this isn't excessive for a company of its size. The large share buyback program in the last couple of years has managed to decline the share count quite a bit:TRIP Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsFrom the Q2 Prepared Remarks:TRIP EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsIt's clear that the shares were excessively valued in the past and that has come down, but with the rally this year, metrics are moving up again. Analysts expect an EPS this year of $1.41, rising to $1.59 the next year.The shares have fallen back a bit on the Q2 results and perhaps they got a little ahead of themselves before.We are hesitant to advice to buy here. There is undeniable progress, most notably in the restaurant and experiences, which show good growth. But the Hotel business is not really growing much.They did manage to increase EBITDA margins quite a bit in the Hotel sector, with cutting inefficient marketing, but we're not at all sure that is repeatable, let alone to the same extent, and it did come at the expense of some revenue growth.Still, they have a good business here. The Hotel business might not grow all that much (if at all), but it still provides cash to invest in share buybacks and other growth areas like restaurants and experiences and the sponsored ads.And they do have a platform with a wide moat and lots of people who land here first to plan their trips, and enormous amounts of data which should enable them to fine tune marketing and paid ads."

Engle Jr., an investment analyst with Almington Capital.Famed travel review website TripAdvisor (TRIP) continues to be plagued by bad decision-making, poor management, stiff competition, and tough industry trends.With little sign of a turnaround on the cards, going long on TripAdvisor looks like a fool’s gamble. We see little hope of the company’s pathologies working themselves out anytime soon.Today, we take a look under the hood of this struggling travel site.On balance, TripAdvisor’s financial performance has not been impressive. The company is not hemorrhaging cash or anything imminently destructive, but it is doing little to create a positive investment story either.TripAdvisor’s revenue has been pretty flat over the last three years. Despite well over 600 million reviews logged on the site, the company is struggling to turn reviews and site traffic into profitability. It continues to struggle with sales growth, and margins have continued to suffer.With sales flat, TripAdvisor cannot hope for significant stock price increases. Revenue dropped from $1.49 billion in 2015 to $1.48 billion in 2016, a 1% dip. Revenue recovered slightly from 2016 to 2017, increasing 5% to $1.56 billion. But even last year’s boost is insufficient to allay many concerns.Further, margins are suffering significantly, indicating an inability to turn around its troubles. Due to an increase in cost of revenue, SG&A expenses, and income tax expense, 2017 actually saw an overall loss for the company, despite the revenue recovery. Net income dropped from $198 million to $120 million from 2015 to 2016 (a 41% drop) and dropped by even more from 2016 to 2017, falling to a net loss of $19 million. That is terrifically bad news for TripAdvisor and its stockholders.Finally, looking at TripAdvisor’s performance versus market expectations brings just another negative tale. Earnings-per-share has failed to reach above $0.25 over the last four consecutive quarters, and Q4 saw a loss of -$0.08 per share, a 300% negative surprise. The company has failed to meet even much-reduced expectations.If TripAdvisor cannot turn a profit in a generally healthy, growing economy, it is a sign of serious trouble for the long-run. It looks as though this might be the case for the foreseeable future. One reason we are highly skeptical of TripAdvisor’s chances to turn things around stems from the company’s history of past mistakes, particularly with its disastrous experiment with an “Instant Booking” feature. Most of TripAdvisor’s revenue is generated from second party referral fee revenue, wherein they direct visitors to their sites to travel booking sites who pay TripAdvisor a nominal referral fee. Such sites include Priceline, Orbitz, and Expedia.However, in 2014, TripAdvisor’s management decided to try introducing an instant booking feature to go head-to-head for business with its referral fee partners. Not only did this cause animosity between the companies (the financial impact of which is not entirely clear), the gamble did not pay off. Users complained of the clunkiness and many did not opt to use the feature. It failed and was basically permanently shelved in 2017.If it wants to succeed, management’s goal would have to be twofold (and it is never easy to fight a battle on two fronts): rapidly increase sales and dramatically cut costs. But those beg the question: how can a company like TripAdvisor, which relies on advertising for its business, ramp up sales without ramping up costs? Management might do well to start by increasing revenue, and worry about costs later. Sales must increase or the ship will sink entirely.Unfortunately, management seems unable to learn from past mistakes. While the restaurant and rental industries are both growing (and currently represent over 20% of TripAdvisor’s revenue), management does not seem to be interested in, or focused on, growing the business in that area. The CEO even recently remarked (during the rather disastrous Q4 2017 earnings call) that the rental feature is too difficult to navigate on the website, but failed to give much guidance on how that problem is to be addressed.Without a clear direction and strategy put forth and then followed upon by management, TripAdvisor’s woes are unlikely to end anytime soon. Management owes it to the shareholders to put forth a clear vision for moving forward – one that turns the company’s financial and operational fortunes around quickly. Focus on rental? Focus on restaurant? Strengthening referral partnerships? Whatever it takes.In the face of their mounting financial and strategic struggles, TripAdvisor now must reckon with increased competition buoyed by an economy on the rise.Juggernauts like Alphabet (GOOG), Marriott (MAR) (the newly minted giant after its purchase of rival SPG), and others are looking at siphoning away business from their competitors.Alphabet can leverage Google’s massive web traffic and user base, while Marriott benefits from a particularly robust loyalty program that it has indicated will continue to grow in scope and scale. TripAdvisor has little to offer by comparison.The jig is up, TripAdvisor. With lagging sales and poor management, we do not see an end in sight for the company’s struggles, and certainly do not foresee profitability that would make us rate this a buy. The water has been collecting for a while in the boat, and now we see that ship starting to show signs of sinking.It would be a well-advised move to steer clear of this one."

4123465,103437,2017-11-10T14:56:45-05:00,"TripAdvisor has had a terrible record of earnings reports dating back to its 2015 highs.It's stronger competitors Priceline and Expedia are trading at a more reasonable valuation for their growth prospects.While the website is useful for travelers, they are not effectively using that to generate revenue and earnings.","TripAdvisor (TRIP) is a user focused community for travelers around the world. It provides a large aggregate of detailed reviews, photos and attractions making it a hub of social activity in regards to travel. However, TRIP has had extreme difficulties turning its large array of reviews and community into revenue growth. So while the website is an exceptional tool, the stock is not one to own going forward. Without growth its competitors like Expedia (EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN) are continuing to take market share from them. This is as the industry continues to evolve with services like AirBNB and Couchsurfing growing in popularity. As the industry evolves, those who fail to evolve with it and provide exceptional customer experience will be left behind. At this time TRIP is a stock to avoid, due to the failures of management to turn around the slow moving ship. Following in the steps of Expedia, TRIP had a weaker Q3 showing than expected. Keep in mind that the several major US hurricanes did contribute to part of the decline in revenue for the entire sector, which was factored into expectations here. Q3 Hotel revenue was actually down year over year from $320m in 2016 to $312m this year. This led to a predictable decrease in adjusted EBITDA from $114m in Q3 2016 to $95m in 2017. The largest increase in expenses that led to this decline in profitability was marketing. The space continues to have advertising spend ramping up, with TRIP going from $210m in marketing spend to $247m in this Q3. Even with this increased spend on TV advertisements and online, they have not been able to turn the use of the website into hotel sales. While the attraction and restaurant revenue has been increasing for TRIP, hotels will always be the bulk of revenue from a website such as this. Without the growth from the hotel segment, the earnings will not be able to keep pace with its sector competition. As seen below the hotel revenue is still 71% of the company's sales, providing just 54% of the adjusted EBITDA. So they have a very large portion of sales that are not effective at generating a profit, even with additional marketing spend.Being smaller than their larger competitors has really hurt them as the marketing spend for TRIP has not produced significant traction in sales. CEO Stephen Kaufer noted on the Q3 call that ""the goal, to remind folks about the TV, was really to present TripAdvisor as a place where not only can you read reviews, but you can do your price-comparison research, and understand how TripAdvisor can save you money."" It seems to me the company has been failing to do that. When I use TripAdvisor I find that it is a great tool to find reviews or information in specific resorts from real people. When it comes time to actually make a purchase however, they site feels more clunky. I often find myself googling anyway to find the best deals afterwards. Trivago (TRVG), spun off from Expedia less than a year ago, is a more effective tool for finding the best deals on hotels. It has recently come under pressure as well as competition in the space continues to ramp up and lower profit margins across the board. While TRVG has fallen recently as well I believe that they are better positioned in the sector in the longer term for revenue growth. TRIP EV to EBITDA (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsAbove is a chart of my preferred metric for comparing peers valuations. I prefer this metric because it is a more capital structure-neutral metric than P/E rating. Despite its constant downtrend of late, TRIP is still quite expensive on EV/EBITDA. After the Q3 earnings drop to the low 30 range, the company still trades at a premium valuation of around 19 EV/EBITDA with revenue this year only slightly above last year. That is with the expenses increasing faster than revenues even with the website traffic and reviews continuing to increase. The average S&P 500 information technology company trades at EV/EBITDA around 13.3. Expedia trades at a very reasonable 14 EV/EBITDA. This is a fair price considering EXPE increased its revenues in Q3 15% y/y and Adjusted EBITDA by 6%. So when it comes to both value and growth, Expedia comes out on top. Priceline has the best growth of the bunch at 20%+, but it is also trading at a much higher valuation at EV/EBITDA of 27.23. In conclusion, at these price levels, clearly Expedia is the stock of the 3 to buy. If you are bullish on the sector, you could own it alone or as part of a pair trade where you go short TRIP. If you are more bearish on the growth prospects of this area, a short position on TripAdvisor even at the mid-$30 range will likely be quite profitable over the next year. TRIP needs to make a large revenue growth turnaround, or its multiple will continue to compress. While I love the website itself, TRIP is struggling to turn those eyeballs into sales showing they may have an issue with the business model overall. This is very worrying as the competition from services like Homeaway from EXPE and AirBNB pick up steam. That should have the stock headed for the mid- to low $20 range to be more comparable to the much superior Expedia in valuation."

Unfortunately, it started to go down and never came back.From 2007 onwards, the company has been engaging into multiple M&A which is something to be contemplated by many investors.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is well-loved travel, hotel and restaurant website which has been providing reliable reviews and recommendations for more than a decade. With 300 million members and half a billion reviews, TripAdvisor is considered as one of the largest travel pages in the world. Currently, it operates primarily in the USA and extends to certain parts of Europe and Asia. And since its IPO in 2011, the company attempted to capture more attention from its customers as well as to increase its finances from its investors, gaining more popularity as a result.But lately, the company seems to be struggling as its financials together with its stock price, shares and market capitalization continue to decline by noticeable amounts. Has the company encountered difficulty in managing itself? Its financials as well as its technical variation and significant press releases will be checked one by one to come up with a concrete understanding towards its current condition.Operating Revenue, Costs and ExpensesThe company’s operating revenue has been impressive that from 945 million in 2013, it became 1.48 billion and 2016. And in 2017, it increased by 80 million, giving a total of 1.56 billion. Moreover, in its quarterlies, it is good to see that the amounts were generally higher than their comparative time series.Meanwhile, costs and expenses increase, too. However, it appears that the costs and expenses rose relatively higher than the sales. They continued to increase in chunks. From a 54-million increase in 2016 with a total amount of 1.31 B, it became 1.43 B in 2017, increasing by 120 million. And as a result, operating income has been declining.Revenue increased, but costs and expenses increased more. This shows a potential danger that has been overlooked for years. By relying on the figures, it can be seen that there is a problem with managing the resources and production. There has been poor management, too. Its weakening operations should be given emphasis this time.Bottomline EarningsThe decreasing trend of operating profit has been worsened by the decline in non-operating income and changes in income tax provision. This resulted to a lower net income. Since 2015, net income has been decreasing. From 226 million in 2014, it fell to 198 million in 2015. It decreased some more in 2016 by 78 million, falling to 120 million. But the latest part is the worst, when net income turned negative. From 120 million, it further decreased by 139 million, giving a net amount of -19 million.As the final result, both Basic and Diluted EPS have been declining as well. And despite the variation in the number of shares, Basic and Diluted EPS continued to fall. And in 2017, both were reported negative,at -0.14.AR 2017 ReportTaken from TripAdvisor official siteAR 2017Taken from TripAdvisor official siteCurrent RatioFrom 2.25 in 2016, it became 2.67 in 2017. This is a result of increase in current assets particularly in cash and decrease in current liabilities. This is a good point that shows that the company has sufficient liquid assets to cover all outstanding short-term obligations.Debt-to-Equity RatioHowever, it seems that its financing activities has a significant portion of borrowings. From just 6.1% in 2016, it became 16.9% in 2017. This is expected as long-term borrowings significantly increased while shareholders equity decreased by a substantial amount. This is a warning for the company to watch out for the possible risks bit may cause.Cash Flow StatementIt is expected for operations to get a lower net inflow due to its continuous decrease in operating income which resulted to an even lower net income which was presented as a line item here. On the other hand, its investing section presented an inflow compared to the previous years which incurred outflows. This occured mainly due to the decrease in Capital Expenditures and entity and investment acquisitions. Its financing section revolved around credit payments and repurchase of stocks.As a whole, it can be traced that cash increased mainly due to lower capital and investment expenditures, sale of investments and stoppage of entity acquisition.DividendsSince its IPO in 2011, the company hasn’t paid any dividends yet. This has been a concern for those who already invested but haven’t realized any earnings on their stock yet, particularly to long-term investors. Another question will appear. Should the company decide to pay dividends, will it still be profitable.In the case of TRIP which happened to incur falling net income in three consecutive years, paying dividends may further lessen the profitability of the company. What’s even more bothersome is its drastically 139 million decrease in 2017 which resulted to net loss. If this continues this year, no dividend payments will be expected in the near future, and worse the possibility of it will decrease, too.Stock PriceThe company’s stock price had its noticeable ups and downs.The movement in 2017 was generally downward though there were evident attempts to rise again. From 50-52, it fell to around 40, rose again and fell to 37-38. It made a quick return to 39 before instantly falling to 31 and 30. In the last quarter, it tried to recover as it continued to climb, ending the year at 34-35.On the other hand, in the first few days of 2018, it started to climb again, reaching its highest point at 37, then fell at 34-35 in the latter part of January. Then in February, it moved to 35, then suddenly rose by 5 points in just a day, then continuously played between 38-41, till it climbed again in March to 42-44. However, it started to fall a week after. Currently, its price is 41 and is expected to go down some more.This may be both exciting and detrimental for short-term investors as drastic increase and decrease that occured in just a day or two, and a maximum of just week or two in 2017 will most likely take place again as shown by the trend. Given the scenario, the wide range of change in price, and the sudden decrease or increase which suggest evident volatility, should always be watched out for instant gain or loss.Taken from MacroTrendsMarket CapitalizationAs of March 15, 2018, TRIP’s market capitalization is 6.08 B.Taken from MacroTrendsThe generally downward trend of price over time as well as the decrease in volume of shares resulted to its expected downward market capitalization trend. When it reached its peak in 2014, it started to go down, though there were occasional crests, the trend has been decreasing. Though it can be seen that after 2017, the line started to climb again, it will still take a long time for TRIP to make an upturn given its price and shares.Though it is still one of the key figures in the industry, the company must thoroughly check its slowly weakening points such as its falling bottomline earnings, contraction as shown by its CapEX decrease, and its generally downward trend in price and shares over the years.Mergers and AcquisitionsFrom 2017-2016, TripAdvisor has been acquiring numerous companies such as Smarter Travel Media, Holiday Watchdog, Jetsetter, Viator Inc. And New York City startup Citymaps.com. With this, it is still considered as the largest online booking/reviews company. But its multiple acquisitions seemed to be inefficient in the last two to three years.As expected, production should’ve expanded. It did as sales kept increasing, but the costs and expenses as well as the non-operating accounts were relatively higher, giving a decreasing net income and EPS, and even turned into loss in 2017. Moreover, stock price and market capitalization continued to decline since 2014.As can be seen, it had the highest number of acquisitions in 2014, and was hyped in the same year as its financials reported an impeccable result and the stock price and market capitalization were on their peak. After that, everything went downwards. If these continue in 2018, it is certain that there have been several problems that will cause a greater loss which may give worries to the investors that the price and capitalization will have to go down, too.The company must now contemplate if it still can su ffice its operations and other service/product lines.ControversiesDuring the last quarter of 2017, the company faced controversies when it was accused of deleting negative reviews on a Mexican Resort (rape and abuse). The site conveyed its apology to the victim after The Journal Sentinel of Milwaukee did an investigation and checked the statements of certain travelers that the site has been deliberately removing their warnings and negative reviews at certain hotels. With this, The Federal Trade Commission might make a move against TRIP.As a result, TRIP reputation might have been stained, and some consumers might lose confidence about it. Also, the company miight incur litigation expenses should these continue.Conclusive ThoughtDifferent factors may yield the different results depending on the length of time. Indeed, TRIP will be in danger if its mismanaged operations as well as the decreasing trend of net income and Capital Expenditures persists. Will it be lucrative to invest in TRIP?Short-term Investors: as the movement in price suggested, investing here may be both exciting and detrimental at the same time. Risk tolerance will play a big role here should short-term investors choose to venture here. The fluctuations in 2017 from 52 to 40, then 40 to 31 and 30 which lasted for a few months before slowly rising to 34, may bother the investors.On the other hand, as the trend continues, the first quarter of 2018 has been good to TRIP. From 34 to 35, it suddenly rose to 39-40 in just a day or two. It continued to play between 38-41 before rising to 41-42. Currently its price plays between 43, 44 and 45. Travel and bookings/reviews have been booming more and are not expected to falter in the foreseeable future. But after a week, its price started to decline from 43-44 to 42. Currently it only plays at 41, and is expected to go down some more.But this is also to warn the investors about the controversies it just faced a few months ago. They must be more watchful for the trend in price and more press releases. Also, the emergence of many other competitors may pose threat to its performance.Weighing things together, short-term investors may invest here but up to a certain extent given the risk of price volatility that it may instantly go down and never come back like what happened in 2017.Long-term Investors: they are discouraged to invest here given its wobbly fundamentals as shown by its increasing operations but decreasing net income and EPS mainly due to ineffective operations ans management expenditures. Its inability to pay dividends for six years is also another flaw about its profitability. Will the company still survive if it will pay dividends? Its real profitability will be seen once it pays dividends since a big pile of its capital comes from shares and investments. Also, the stoppage of acquisitions and decrease in CapEx doesn’t show any possible sign of expansion. As the Cash Flow and Balance Sheet conveys, the company just focuses on share and debt capitalization (more on repayment of debt) relative to its operations. One just can’t sit and relax after investing here since no earnings will be expected in the near future. Indeed, there will be no dividend payments to be expected this year or at least in the foreseeable future. This is to reiterate that this doesn’t fit the dividend-growth seeking investors.To summarize this, both its fundamentals and technical have been stumbling and no concrete solution has been provided for this, worsened by the emergence of its competitors as well as the negative stigma it has been associated with. If all these persist, its value will continue to drop which may be harmful to the company as well as to the investors."
4101454,103602,2017-08-23T17:40:50-04:00,TripAdvisor has seen a significant decrease in its stock price recently which has turned away many investors.TripAdvisor has finally turned the corner on developing its Instant Booking feature and on confronting the rise of mobile phone traffic.TripAdvisor's Non-Hotel Segment stands poised for substantial long-term growth that has gone largely unnoticed by investors.,"TripAdvisor (TRIP), although one of the most well-known online travel agencies in the world, has struggled recently. Just a year ago its stock price was hovering around $61.50 whereas now it has fallen 35% to under $40.00. While this fall which began in 2014 when the stock price was at $110 has turned many investors away, there seems to finally be enough upside to justify an investment in TRIP.Fundamental QualitiesThe reason that TripAdvisor has been able to exist alongside industry behemoths such as Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE) is that TripAdvisor has built an impressive competitive advantage based on its reviewing system. TripAdvisor had over 465 million reviews of millions of hotels, restaurants, and activities (at the end of 2016, according to the company’s 10-K). And this portfolio of reviews continues to grow. According to ComScore, TripAdvisor sees growth in number of unique visitors and reviews each quarter. No wonder that 40 to 50% of all travel researched online is influenced by TripAdvisor. This edge has both solidified TripAdvisor’s place in the travel services industry and has increased TripAdvisor’s brand awareness globally.This competitive advantage is a fundamental reason why TripAdvisor is a good investment. No other company will be able to overcome TripAdvisor in this area without impressive amounts of investment (both of time and money), so there is little danger of TripAdvisor fading from view or losing out to another company within this area of the industry.Valuation AnalysisTripAdvisor, with a market cap of $5.64 billion, is a small fish when compared to its two main competitors: Expedia, with a market cap of $21.79 billion, and Priceline, with a market cap of $88.95 billion. TripAdvisor’s stock price has also fared the worst out of all three in the last year, with a drop of 35%, whereas Expedia’s stock has risen 29% and Priceline’s has risen 27%. However, there seems to be little to justify this divergence when the fundamentals of each company are compared.It is true that TripAdvisor did not fare as well in growing revenue in 2016. Its revenue decreased by 1% while Expedia’s grew by 31.49% and Priceline’s grew by 16.47%. It should be noted, though, that TripAdvisor rebounded in the latest quarter and saw revenue rise by 8.44%. Other key ratios, however, indicate that TripAdvisor is not so far behind Expedia and Priceline. TripAdvisor has a FCF yield of 4.41% which is in line with that of Priceline (4.33%), and not too far behind that of Expedia (6.78%). TripAdvisor also has a FCF to sales ratio of 15.79% which is slightly higher than the 15.64% of Expedia. TripAdvisor also carries the lightest relative load of debt with a debt to equity ratio of 0.19, which is well below that of Priceline (0.65) and Expedia (0.76).TripAdvisor’s price-to-earnings ratio of 59.4 may seem to be a cause for alarm, but it is lower than Expedia’s of 67.4, and not too far above Priceline’s at 38.5. Also, TripAdvisor’s PEG ratio of 1.7 is healthy and in line with that of Priceline (1.4) and Expedia (1.6). While this is just a small sampling of financial ratios, these comparisons do indicate that TripAdvisor is in line with its competitors whose stock prices have seen major growth recently. Non-Hotel SegmentWhile the Hotel segment of TripAdvisor makes up the bulk of its revenue, the non-Hotel segment is occupying a largely unseen but soon-to-be lucrative market for the company. TripAdvisor already has a position in this segment with reviews on 4.3 million restaurants and almost 800,000 tours and attractions, and I see the tours and attractions area being the largest driver of growth in the future for the company. According to a note by Greenwood Investors, the market for attractions and tours stands at roughly $150 billion which allows TripAdvisor almost unlimited room to operate given that it has a current revenue base of only $1.5 billion. Not only is there a large market available, but there is also little potential competition who could compete with TripAdvisor’s brand name and foothold in this market.TripAdvisor’s management is also growing increasingly optimistic about this opportunity. In an interview in July 2017, CEO Steve Kaufer explained how there is “massive opportunity” for TripAdvisor in this space because they are “probably the biggest in category.” Kaufer has also told investors that he believes that the tours and attractions segment could become the next $1 billion category for TripAdvisor. Even if that number takes years to reach, TripAdvisor will still see growing revenue from this segment as it continues to develop its position.Some of these projections may seem grandiose, but the growth in the Non-Hotel segment’s revenue recently backs up the idea that this segment could soon become a major revenue driver. According to the company’s 10-K, Non-Hotel revenue saw an increase of 27% to $290 million in 2016. This new revenue total was also good for an increase of 161% over revenue generated from the segment in 2014. Q1 and Q2 of 2017 tell the same story. Q1 revenue in 2017 from the Non-Hotel segment was $58 million which was an increase of 18% over Q1 revenue in 2016. Q2 revenue in 2017 fared even better, increasing 31% over Q2 revenue in 2016.This potential in the Non-Hotel segment of TripAdvisor has largely gone unseen by investors because, historically, it has not contributed much to the overall company (consider that in 2014 it only made up 9% of total revenue for the company). However, as the growing revenues show, the company is finally beginning to take advantage of this segment. And with management showing enthusiasm in developing their offerings in this space, TripAdvisor stands poised to reap the rewards of this multi-billion-dollar market. These developments will pay off handsomely for investors not only because of the impressive increases in revenue, but also because this area has long been overlooked. In the past years much of the focus has been on other aspects of TripAdvisor such as the Instant Booking feature which has meant that the stock price does not reflect the true value of the Non-Hotel segment and its potential for growth. While it may take some time for TripAdvisor to completely realize this opportunity, the advantages the company holds indicate that it will be able to see significant revenue growth in the future from this segment.Hotel SegmentThe Hotel Segment of TripAdvisor is, at least in the short-term, TripAdvisor’s most important source of revenue (it accounted for 80% of all revenue in 2016). Thus, although the Non-Hotel Segment stands poised for significant long-term growth, any investment into TripAdvisor must consider the prospects of this area of the business. Thankfully for investors, there is also upside in this segment for TripAdvisor as they address two key issues: the Instant Booking feature and the increase in mobile phone traffic.Instant Booking, a feature launched in 2014, was designed to increase the number of users who booked directly on TripAdvisor’s site rather than on partner companies’ websites. This was not a success for the company and has remained a drag on earnings ever since. However, TripAdvisor seems to have changed course recently to a path that should have significant upside for investors. According to a Cowen and Co. note, TripAdvisor has reverted to its more traditional price comparisons and only highlights Instant Booking when it provides the user the best deal. The Cowen and Co. note continues with the benefits of this change, “we estimate the changes could drive [approximately] $50-100M annualized benefit to TripAdvisor revenue, adding approximately 5 percent to total revenue growth and approximately 10 percent to growth in the flagship meta/IB revenue line.”The other big issue with the Hotel Segment has been the rise of mobile phone usage and the revenue headwinds that come with it. Even though mobile phone usage hurts earnings in the short-term, in the long-term there are trends heading in TripAdvisor’s favor. According to a statement made by CEO Kaufer at the end of Q2, “TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue on mobile grew by more than 60 percent year-over-year, driven by accelerated hotel shopper growth of 36 percent.” This “accelerated mobile hotel shopper growth” indicates that TripAdvisor has been building up an advantage in this new market which will manifest in increasing revenues, as it has been. According to Kaufer, “the latest quarter was our third straight quarter of monetization improvements on mobile, and we see a lot more opportunity ahead as we continue to optimize the new hotel shopping experience.” Although mobile phones deliver substantially lower revenue-per-user relative to desktop users, TripAdvisor is embracing this change and developing itself for the new mobile user. These developments should increase revenues over the long-term as TripAdvisor builds its advantage in this market and is able to offset the lower revenue-per-user with a rising market share.RisksWhile there are substantial growth prospects for TripAdvisor, there do remain some risks to the business that could create downward pressure on the stock. One of the major risks to the company is that TripAdvisor’s image remains geared towards reading and writing reviews rather than booking on the site itself. While TripAdvisor is an important tool for many travelers, many times they will visit a different site to make their reservations which means TripAdvisor misses out on revenue. To combat this trend, TripAdvisor is rolling out a multi-million-dollar advertising campaign that will try to attract users who use the site with the intention to book directly on the platform, rather than just to read reviews. Even though this advertising campaign is a good step towards generating revenue from TripAdvisor’s popularity, there is still the possibility that TripAdvisor’s image will not be improved much. In that case, this campaign would be a massive loss of money and time, and TripAdvisor would be no closer to leveraging its competitive advantage in growing revenue.Another risk to TripAdvisor is its dependence on a relatively small number of business partners. According to the company’s 10-K, Expedia and Priceline accounted for 46% of total revenue in 2016. The loss of either of these companies as partners, or even the loss of business from them, would be devastating to TripAdvisor. While this is not a probability, investors should understand the risk that comes from investing in a company that relies on only two companies for almost half of its revenue.ConclusionTripAdvisor’s stock price remains undervalued and presents a good buying opportunity for investors. The company’s fundamentals show that it compares favorably with Priceline and Expedia, both of whom have seen impressive growth in their stocks recently. TripAdvisor has impressive long-term prospects in both the Non-Hotel and the Hotel Segment. The Non-Hotel Segment remains largely unnoticed by investors, but has significant upside as TripAdvisor takes advantage of the massive untapped market there. In addition, the potential available in the market of mobile phone users and TripAdvisor’s revamped Instant Booking feature are both reasons for optimism within the Hotel Segment. TripAdvisor also has good efforts underway to combat the risks that face the company. Overall, TripAdvisor’s strong fundamentals, multiple avenues of growth, and limited risk make it an attractive investment for any portfolio."
4137901,104099,2018-01-16T23:21:46-05:00,"In my view, investors would be wise to avoid shares of TripAdvisor, as the price is way out of line with value.The market is forecasting a 10% perpetual growth rate here, which is the definition of an ahistorical assumption. You can't ask a cat to bark.In my view, company management hasn't been particularly shareholder-friendly, which is always a bad sign.","Apparently, I’m always “going on” about the importance of protecting capital when it comes to investing. I agree that I speak of it reasonably often (only about 20 times a day), but I think “going on” is a bit of an exaggeration. That aside, I’m going to fill my “avoid loss” quotient for the day by talking about TripAdvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP). In my view, this stock currently represents the worst of all possible worlds for an investor: a low-growth stock that trades at a significant premium to the overall market. I’ll go through my reasoning below by focusing on the company's financial statement, and then reviewing the stock. For those who can’t stand the suspense (or my writing), this is a company that has near perfection embedded in its price. This is peculiar in light of the fact that TRIP's financial performance has been far from perfect. Let’s get into it.A quick glance at the financial history here indicates instantly that the fortunes of this company have changed a great deal over the years. Its financial performance has been volatile and disappointing for a host of reasons. First, net income margin has declined consistently, from about 25% in 2012 to 5% now. Its net income and earnings per share are both lower now than they were in 2012.Until January 1, 2017, the capital structure actually looked like it was improving, with long-term debt in decline, but in the first nine months of 2017, management executed a wealth-destroying share buyback for $250 million (see below). This is troublesome, from my perspective, because of the relatively sizeable amount of goodwill and intangible assets on the books.Specifically, at the moment, fully 38% of the assets of the company are either intangible assets or goodwill. TripAdvisor has purchased 15 businesses over the past three years, and the majority of the $756 goodwill on the balance sheet represents the amount it paid for these businesses minus the net tangible assets on the books. In other words, the company paid $756 million more for its string of acquisitions than those businesses were worth. It may be the case that these investments pay off, but there's certainly no guarantee. In my view, the risk of a large goodwill writedown hangs like the sword of Damocles over this business. Investors should expect to be compensated for taking on the risk of buying in now.So, to sum up, TripAdvisor is a company whose net income seems to be in decline. The capital structure is troubled because management took on a great deal of debt in a short period of time. At the same time, 32% of the asset side of the balance sheet is made up of goodwill and other intangibles.I try to look beyond the numbers and judge the behavior of management when analyzing a company. This is critical because I think a shareholder-friendly management team is a necessary precondition for investment. If management is unfriendly, loss is almost inevitable. In my view, the TripAdvisor management team hasn’t been stellar in terms of how it's treated owners, as evidenced first by the dilution. There are more shares outstanding now than there were in 2012. This is the case even after management borrowed $250 million in the first nine months of 2017 to buy back 6,079,003 shares at an average selling price of $41.13. I can’t blame the management team for the vagaries of the market, but I’m obliged to point out that the repurchase price is about 13% higher than the current price. The end result of this effort, though, is that shareholders are left with more debt and a loss on their treasury share repurchase.More troubling to me is the fact that the company has never paid a dividend. It has access to a multi-currency credit facility greater than $1 billion (some of which was used for the transaction above), so has sufficient access to cash to fund operations, but management has never rewarded shareholders with a dividend. In my view, this speaks volumes.(Source: Company filings, 10-K, 10-Q)With such a checkered financial past, you’d think shares of TripAdvisor would trade at a discount to the overall market. Well, if you assumed that, you would be mistaken. The market is assuming a very robust perpetual growth rate for the shares, and they are trading at a very high price-to-free cash flow multiple.When I judge the merits of a business, I first test the market’s assumptions about long-term growth. The exact methodology for doing this is beyond the scope of this article, but it’s covered very well in Professor Stephen Penman’s excellent book, Accounting For Value. At the moment, the market is forecasting a perpetual earnings growth rate of about 10% for this business. This is a ridiculous assumption, in my view, and investors who buy in now will inevitably be disappointed, in my estimation. For those interested in a more traditional measure of valuation, I should point out that the company currently sports a price-to-free cash flow ratio of around 27. This is excessive, in my view.The obvious catalyst for the shares is a purchase. If some entity decides to bid for the entirety of the company, the stock will obviously rise. In my view, this is a remote risk for the simple reason that there’s little value here. If I were a competitor, I would simply wait for the inevitable to happen. If I had a large pool of capital, I would know that there are much better ways to spend $5 billion.First, the market is forecasting a ridiculously high perpetual growth rate for the company. Second, shares are trading on a price-to-free cash flow basis that is quite rich, in my estimation. Third, ""perpetual"" is a very long time, and along that path, the company is sure to disappoint. Investors who buy in at these levels will suffer as a result. Also, the stock is trading near the high end of its range in terms of price to free cash flow.Investing is a relativistic game, meaning that we must always choose between the best imperfect option available to us. It’s a difficult thing to do, because we must play the game on two levels in a sense. We must examine the company, and then we must decide what to pay for the stock. The latter is challenging because, in the short term at least, the stock often behaves according to rules of its own. In the short term, the stock is governed more by the mood of the crowd than by something relating to the underlying business. It’s for this reason that stock price and value often move at odds to each other.It’s with that in mind that I’ll repeat what I’ve often said: investing can be a dream or it can be a nightmare. It’s a dream when you can find good companies whose stocks trade at a discount. If you buy in that circumstance, you can afford to be patient and make money as the price you paid rises to match the inherent value in the company. It’s a nightmare when you pay too much and price and value inevitably collide in the future.In my view, TripAdvisor represents the nightmare scenario above. The shares are priced for a perfection that this company has never demonstrated. In addition, management doesn’t seem to treat shareholders particularly well, so my question is this: in a universe of thousands of traded securities, why would you buy this one at these levels? In my view, investors would be wise to avoid the stock until the price comes down or something changes at the company."
4101230,101543,2017-08-23T08:28:24-04:00,"TripAdvisor's monetization problems have provided this opportunity.The company has continually grown unique visitors and reviews on its platform.Using peer analysis, fair estimate is $55 per share.","TripAdvisor (TRIP) has taken a beating the past few years. The company was spun off from Expedia (EXPE) in December 2011 and came out of the gates strong. Since mid-2014 shares have lost approximately 60%.TRIP data by YChartsI'm going straight to the point: the company has a monetization problem which has caused investors to be leery. This near term issue has created an opportunity. Great opportunities normally don't exist without volatility.Even though this decline has persisted over the past two years, much has been accomplished, like the growing of their average monthly unique visitors from 223 million in Q1 2014 to 386 million in Q1 2017 (Exhibit 1).Exhibit 1: Monthly Unique VisitorsSource: Investor PresentationPractically all content within their network is user-generated for free and user engagement appears healthy. There is a large network effect, and it still remains strong today with 290 reviews/new content contributed every minute on the site.The monetization problems have come from multiple factors such as incorporating instant booking into the site, users switching to mobile, and enhanced competition, mainly from Trivago (TRVG) and Kayak (NASDAQ:KYAK). Mobile users monetize at lower rates and management has been extremely focused on the user experience through their mobile app. The company is in the top five travel iOS mobile applications in many markets around the world.The true intrinsic value is not being shown today with any recovery in revenue and cash flow metrics. This can already be seen with revenue per hotel shopper restoring back to 2015 levels.Furthermore, I believe the company's non-hotel segment's story hasn't been fully told. Just this past quarter revenue growth came in at 31% with healthy EBITDA margins of 17%. This segment represents 23% of the revenue base and offers a long runway. Here are some thoughts from the CEO Stephen Kaufer on the non-hotel business back in 2014:Exhibit 2: Select Historical Financial DataSource: Company ReportsExhibit 3: Peer Analysis Hotel SegmentSource: Morningstar, Gurufocus, Company ReportsPriceline Group (PCLN) might not be the best comparable name since the majority of its revenue comes from commissions earned through facilitating reservations. The company though does own Kayak which is a main competitor to TripAdvisor.Trivago is the best comparable, and due to the company focusing on long term goals of capturing market share, EBITDA numbers look very poor. Selling and marketing cost equal 69% of revenue. This is unsustainable and more normalized spending should take place over the next few years, alleviating marketing spend for TripAdvisor which sits at 50%. When considering TTM revenues for Trivago at $982 million and using a normalized EBITDA margin of 30%, it equates to the company generating $295 million in EBITDA or selling at a 12x multiple.Exhibit 4: Fair Value Estimate Hotel SegmentSource: Author's WorkI used a slightly higher valuation multiple for TripAdvisor's hotel segment since I believe it has a stronger brand identity, and already spends less in sales in marketing while producing EBITDA earnings. Trivago is buying growth which can be a good strategy, but is unsustainable and there's a big question mark as to what happens when they turn off this lever.Non-hotel SegmentThe non-hotel segment is a very fragmented industry. There is an expected long runway while heavy investments are being made. This past quarter positive EBITDA earnings showed up. This is a positive sign as the company continues to increase bookable products through their platform.Exhibit 4: Peer Analysis Non-hotel SegmentSource: Morningstar, Company ReportsThe higher multiples for GrubHub (GRUB) could be justified by having larger EBITDA margins. For conservative valuation purposes I used Yelp's (YELP) EV/sales multiple. Estimating forward sales for 2017 and extracting multiples from that provides any future growth factors into our valuation multiple. By applying the 3.7x multiple, which is in line with Yelp, the lowest peer group multiple gives a forward valuation of $1.3 billion or $9.13 per share (Exhibit 5).Exhibit 5: Fair Value Estimate Non-hotel SegmentSource: Author's WorkExhibit 6: Sum-of-the-parts ValuationSource: Author's WorkWith using normalized assumptions and peer group analysis, TripAdvisor offers 38% upside or a fair value estimate of $55 per share. Long term, over 5-10 years, I see a company that could compound capital at attractive returns that could equate to multiples of an investment if users stay engaged with the platform and the monetization metrics improve.I normally like to own businesses with management owning a significant amount of shares to align their goals with common shareholders. The CEO Steve Kaufer owns approximately 440,384 shares or a dollar value of $17.6 million. This is healthy ownership when considering the size of the organization, and the fact that combined executive ownership, is roughly 1.4 million - representing $56 million. If shares do grow to fair value estimates that would bring total value creation among the 13 executives to $77 million, which is significant.Its also worth noting that Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings owns 21% of the company and 56% of the voting interest managed by Greg B. Maffei CEO of Liberty Media (FWONA).The hotel segment should continue to grow in the high single digits while the non-hotel segment keeps churning out 20% or more growth. I believe investors have underestimated the non-hotel business and how attractive the economics are. While bookables continue to expand I believe EBITDA margins should improve closer to 25%.The company controls the demand side of the market by helping purchasing decisions. There is a gap though in the total revenue that the company has influence on as to what percentage it captures, which is very minimum. This gap should start to close as instant booking features have been fixed to maximize revenues collected from their platform.Also, another thing that hasn't been discussed much is the company bought back approximately 6 million shares over the last few quarters. Those 6 million shares represented 4% of the shares outstanding. This use of cash does seems like a bullish call from management.The company checks many boxes in terms of what I look for in an investment: a strong competitive advantage through their platform/network; good inside executive ownership; and fair value estimates below peers in an industry that has a long runway with significant tailwinds.To read more research on stock spin-offs, micro-mid cap companies, and special situations, please consider following me (by clicking the ""Follow"" button at the top of this article next to my name) to receive notification when I publish research next."
4110580,101969,2017-09-30T10:25:10-04:00,"TripAdvisor is a highly coveted acquisition target, given its massive 415 million monthly unique user base and the long-term growth of online travel.Management and the board realize that larger internet companies could help TripAdvisor achieve its strategic goals, and they have an obligation to entertain offers for the company.The new executive severance plan and the odd lack of a reauthorized share repurchase program, despite recent buybacks at higher prices, suggest the company may have been approached.","I believe TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) will announce one of two things over the coming year:In this report I will explain why other companies want to buy TripAdvisor, why management and the board would entertain selling now, and two mysterious clues that suggest something could be in the works.TripAdvisor is a one-of-a-kind asset in a sector that will see secular growth for a long time. It is the world's largest travel site with over 415 million monthly unique visitors, and that figure continues to grow at a double-digit rate. The TripAdvisor brand is synonymous with travel research and planning, and its immediately recognized owl logo is ubiquitous around the world in hotel and restaurant windows. Travel is a $1.6 trillion global market and only about $500 billion of that is spent online. Not only is the travel market itself growing but also online is continuing to take share of the market. The less than one-third online penetration highlights the large opportunity ahead.TripAdvisor has a strong competitive advantage in its user generated content that ensures its position as the go-to site for travel research and planning is sustainable over the long term. Other companies can collect reviews and opinions, and several of them are doing so, but none of them are known as the place to go for travel research and planning. We need no more evidence that TripAdvisor is not at risk from these review-collecting efforts than to simply look at the overwhelming size and continued growth of its site traffic. If other companies were eroding this moat, we would see monthly unique users declining. Of course, that is not the case.TripAdvisor as an online media property has underlying returns on tangible capital that are off-the-charts. At its core, TripAdvisor is a website and an app. It costs very little to run a website and app and those costs get amortized over 415 million unique users per month. Incremental returns on tangible capital are even better because additional site or app users cost little more than the cost to acquire them. Operating leverage should allow for margin expansion over the long term.Some of the largest and most ambitious technology companies today have their hands in several attractive growth markets, but do not participate in the online travel business. Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and others come to mind. It is not necessarily because they lack the desire or have not tried. Amazon tried and failed twice to enter the hotel booking business with Amazon Destinations. Alibaba just recently announced a joint venture with Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR). Online travel is a big business that is likely to grow for decades, so it is understandable that these large ambitious companies would want to participate.What could Amazon do with TripAdvisor that it could not do alone? Amazon could very simply integrate hotel booking on TripAdvisor with Prime. Prime members who book hotels on TripAdvisor (known as Instant Booking (""IB""), TripAdvisor's thus far disappointing effort to become more of a hotel OTA) could instantly receive 5% off the prevailing best hotel prices. Amazon would benefit by adding yet another Prime member perk because it accelerates Prime member growth, and Prime members are known to spend anywhere from double to triple what non-Prime members spend on Amazon.The economics would work because TripAdvisor's Instant Booking takes roughly 10%-15% of the hotel booking as its commission, so offering a 5% rebate back to Prime members would still leave TripAdvisor with 5%-10% of the booking value. There are an estimated 80 or 90 million Prime households worldwide, and each household probably has perhaps 3-4 people on average, so there are probably over 300 million people with access to Prime benefits worldwide. And that number continues to grow.This discount approach would jive perfectly with Amazon's general business approach where they work to lower, not raise, prices in order to delight more and more customers, win market share, and grow their business.Hotels have been rooting for TripAdvisor to become a third major OTA in order to provide more competition to Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline Group (PCLN). TripAdvisor's 10%-15% commissions for IB are lower than the typical commissions the big OTAs charge to the hotels, so hotels would prefer to see more of their third-party bookings come through TripAdvisor than through the other big OTAs. Thus far, IB has been a disappointment because in most cases it does not monetize as well as TripAdvisor's metasearch links that send users over to the OTAs to book. As a result, TripAdvisor tends to highlight metasearch links over to Expedia, Priceline, and others as the ""featured"" booking option much more often than it highlights IB. So hotels have not been able to reduce their third-party marketing fees in any meaningful way.How would Amazon owning TripAdvisor change this? For one thing, Amazon is a massive company whose only goal is the maximization of long-term free cash flow; it cares nothing about short-term metrics as long as it is maximizing its business for the long-term. As a result, Amazon could immediately have TripAdvisor sever ties with Expedia and Priceline. These two companies currently make up 46% of TripAdvisor's revenue, so they are important to TripAdvisor on a standalone basis, but would not be important to an Amazon-owned TripAdvisor to the extent that it would advance Amazon's strategic objective of entering and growing in the online hotel booking category.You might wonder what would be in it for Amazon to have Trip's revenue immediately fall by almost half. Well, it wouldn't. Expedia and Priceline are 46% of revenue because they pay the most in the cost-per-click (""CPC"") auctions on TripAdvisor and thus show up as the featured partner. There are other bidders for most of these auctions behind the scenes, including smaller OTAs and the hotels themselves, who routinely get outbid by the ""big two."" If Amazon severed ties with Expedia and Priceline, these bidders would win the auctions at modestly lower prices than TripAdvisor was previously receiving, so TripAdvisor's revenue would not implode.It is well-known that Priceline, in particular, has the ""long tail"" of hotels around the world in its system that other competitors, including TripAdvisor, do not. But Amazon has the resources and proclivity to hire a few thousand hotel salespeople to travel the world and bring all that content onto TripAdvisor's system. It would take time, perhaps several years, but much progress would be made every year. Most importantly, Amazon thinks with a long-term perspective (Jeff Bezos has cited in the past that he thinks in terms of 7 year cycles, although I bet he'd say an even longer number today) and would not bat an eye about making that investment.While an Amazon-TripAdvisor tie up would make all the sense in the world, I would think Facebook and Alibaba could similarly turn their massive user bases in TripAdvisor's direction and significantly increase TripAdvisor's IB revenue.""Existential risk"" is a strong term, but TripAdvisor being acquired by any of these companies would be a serious risk to Expedia and Priceline. All of a sudden, the world's largest travel site with 415 million monthly unique users (a figure that dwarfs their user bases) is a full-blown hotel OTA in direct competition with them, that undercuts them on price with the hotels, and is backed by Amazon or Facebook or Alibaba. Furthermore, roughly 10%-15% of the big OTAs' bookings come directly from TripAdvisor leads. That would disappear overnight if TripAdvisor were to sever ties with them. These scenarios would keep me up at night if I were Mark Okerstrom, Expedia's new CEO, or Glenn Fogel, Priceline's CEO. So much so that they should be motivated to outbid Amazon/Facebook/Alibaba/others even if only as a defensive move to keep TripAdvisor out of the ""wrong hands.""I can imagine a scenario where the bidding for TripAdvisor gets surprisingly high given these dynamics. On one side we'd have enormous deep pocketed global tech companies who could quite easily make far more money from TripAdvisor than TripAdvisor can do on its own. On the other side, we have the two incumbent dominant hotel OTAs who really, really do not want to see TripAdvisor owned by a company like Amazon. Like TripAdvisor's CPC auctions, the winner is the highest bidder, and auction processes with several motivated bidders tend to result in high prices.TripAdvisor's efforts to better monetize its hotel user base have stalled. IB looked very promising early on but has since been downplayed at least until it monetizes better. Trivago's (NASDAQ:TRVG) surge over the last few years has clearly taken market share from TripAdvisor, although that may be now beginning to reverse. Currently, Priceline may be adjusting its paid traffic acquisition strategies and bidding less aggressively in TripAdvisor's CPC auctions. Whether that is permanent or simply a test that does not end up serving their objectives, I don't know, but it is a current headwind. The company's stock (TRIP) once fetched over $100 per share only a few years ago and now languishes around $40 per share.To be sure, TripAdvisor's founder and CEO Steve Kaufer is an unwavering long-term thinker. The company's recent struggles do not appear to flinch him or dampen his enthusiasm for the company's long-term future. He seems particularly excited by prospects for an all-mobile or near all-mobile world where TripAdvisor's ""all-in-one"" travel app makes it the only travel app necessary for many people. Repeat app usage has zero traffic acquisition costs, so user monetization would come at very high margins. The attractions business in particular seems to have an extremely bright future.That said, Kaufer and his board, led by Liberty's Greg Maffei, must recognize - to one degree or another - that TripAdvisor could probably fulfill its mission more effectively as part of a larger company with more resources. They also have an obligation to shareholders, themselves included, to entertain offers for the company.At the Deutsche Bank conference earlier this year, Maffei was asked the following:Maffei responded:The follow up question:And Maffei's answer:As Chairman of TripAdvisor, Chairman and CEO of Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings (LTRPA), and someone with a large personal financial stake on the line, Maffei's comments are fascinating. He could have answered these questions in any way he wanted. He could have simply gave a generic answer about how TripAdvisor is focused on the long-term and how they're optimistic they can improve user monetization over time. He could have said the OTA industry will probably see new technologies emerge, driven by artificial intelligence and machine learning, an increasing mobile-orientation, perhaps voice-search based bookings in some cases. Instead he chose to highlight by name the other large tech companies that could enter the OTA market. The only realistic, or let me rephrase, the easiest and most obvious way to ""enter the OTA market"" would be to acquire the world's largest travel site and turn it into a full-blown OTA. Amazon already tried doing it alone twice and shut down the effort. So ""entering the OTA market"" can only mean ""acquire TripAdvisor,"" in my view.It is fairly eye-brow raising for the Chairman of a large company to essentially hang for ""for sale"" sign on the company in a public forum. But that is what he did.On August 8th, TripAdvisor filed its second-quarter 10-Q. Buried on page 55 of 58, the company disclosed that its board had adopted a new executive severance plan that included new terms that would go into effect upon a change-in-control of the company. Boards do not go to the trouble of writing and adopting something like this without good reason. In my career, I have seen a company amend the terms of its change-in-control executive compensation and then get acquired six weeks later. In my view, chances are TripAdvisor was approached to talk about an acquisition and quickly adopted this plan, just in case something were to occur.Another mystery is TripAdvisor did not renew its share repurchase authorization when the last one expired in June. Previously, the company had repurchased shares at average prices of $50.76, $42.49, and $39.23 over the last three quarters. The company spent $334 million repurchasing 7.7 million shares in total, and got more aggressive as the shares fell. The company completed the last of their most recent last share repurchase authorization in June, but has since not renewed it. So why could that be? I can think of a few reasons.1. The company is preserving cash to make one or more sizable acquisitions. I don't think this is the case. I cannot think of any major hotel segment acquisitions the company could make. TripAdvisor's last major acquisitions were Viator and La Fourchette in 2014 to round out the non-hotel attractions and restaurants businesses, respectively. Since then, acquisitions have been small tuck-ins or useful technologies like City Maps. I wouldn't be surprised to see more small acquisitions like these, but nothing that would put a dent in TripAdvisor's $900 million cash hoard. As for a large acquisition, I cannot see Greg Maffei, a legendary capital allocator, being on board with acquiring a large company, perhaps such as Yelp. He would essentially be passing up the chance to buyback more shares of TripAdvisor at what he acknowledges is a very depressed price in favor of buying Yelp most likely at a large control premium and almost certainly with undervalued TRIP stock. That is the last thing one should do if they think your own shares are undervalued, which he does as evidenced by the $334 million spent on buybacks over the last nine months.2. The company only had $221 million of its cash and securities held in the U.S., available for share buybacks, and wants to preserve that liquidity. The rest is held overseas and would be subject to a large repatriation tax (unless or until the Republican tax plan is adopted). I doubt this is the reason. In addition to the $221 million of cash in the U.S., the company has roughly $1 billion available to draw on its credit facility. Therefore the company has over $1.2 billion of dry powder available for buybacks. Clearly, a lack of resources with which to buy back stock is not the reason.3. TripAdvisor tends not to generate much cash in the second half because its deferred merchant payable balance unwinds, so it could have a strong preference to only repurchase shares with free cash flow. (Deferred merchant payables are generated when the company collects cash from bookings for attractions, vacation rentals, and hotels in some cases. It keeps that cash on the books until the stay or usage occurs at which point it pays it out to the vendors. That tends to occur more in the second half when summer vacations tend to happen in the third quarter.) It is possible the company is planning to wait until early next year to authorize a new buyback plan so it can utilize its positive free cash flow in the first half for buybacks. I highly doubt this is the reason. For one thing, TripAdvisor began meaningfully repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter of last year. It spent $84 million on repurchases while only generating $29 million of free cash flow (defined as CFO-capex), so clearly there is no strong preference to only repurchase shares with free cash flow.4. The company would rather not use its credit facility to repurchase shares because it would increase debt levels. That is an unlikely reason in this case. The company was already using its credit facility to repurchase shares in 1Q and 2Q of this year, so there is no obvious aversion to doing so. Furthermore, there is only $260 million of credit facility debt on the books. Repurchasing another $250 million of stock over six months would not meaningfully increase the company's financial leverage. In fact, the company would still remain in a large net cash position given the $900 million of cash and securities it has.5. The board decided to stop repurchasing shares because something material has changed and it no longer views repurchases as a good use of cash. That is farfetched. TripAdvisor's headwinds are not new. Google has been pushing free search results further down the page in favor of paid search for years. Trivago has been a growing competitor for a long time, but their recent woes are good for TripAdvisor because they are dialing back their aggressive TV spending. TripAdvisor's mix shift of traffic to mobile has been a headwind to near-term monetization for a long time. All these things were true in 4Q, 1Q, and 2Q while the company was repurchasing shares aggressively. Given Greg Maffei's track record of capital allocation and share shrink at other Liberty entities, there would have had to be a massive negative change out of the blue for the company to conclude that shares in the $35-$40 range are no longer undervalued just months after repurchasing at prices as high as $51 per share. That is not the case. Site traffic and engagement remains very strong, and most if not all of its headwinds are temporary, in my view.6. The company was approached by a potential acquirer, and therefore could not repurchase shares while in possession of material, non-public information (""MNPI""). Given that the other five potential reasons seem so unlikely, I think this is the only remaining plausible reason. And when I consider this, in conjunction with the new executive severance plan, it only points me further in this direction.I have no idea if an acquisition of TripAdvisor will actually come to fruition, at least anytime soon. If discussions are currently underway, they could easily fall through. If that occurs, we would never hear about it, but I think the company would authorize another share purchase program at that point since it would no longer be restricted. So to repeat the opening of this report, I believe TripAdvisor will announce one of two things:Thank you for reading this Seeking Alpha PRO article.

4100773,102841,2017-08-21T15:25:29-04:00,"TripAdvisor has been implementing a new strategy to expand the streams of income and further monetize the main platform.This strategic transformation brought down the profitability, resulting in a shares decline.There are early signs that the strategic transformation may result in margin expansion in the near future.As a result, it may be a good time to be bullish, particularly for contrarian investors.","TripAdvisor (TRIP) may be on a good path to turn the business around. The company has been diversifying away from being dependent on income from hotel business during the last three years. At first, the diversification brought a painful period for shareholders as the transition brought down the profitability. In fact, the operating margin declined from 39% in 2012 to 11% in 2016. However, the non-hotel stream of income is turning positive after the years of negative contribution and, therefore, may suggest that operating margin is reaching a bottom. As the operating margin is set to expand, the equity should appreciate. In addition, the company is in a rapidly growing industry, is free cash-flow positive, does have a healthy balance sheet, and has been rewarding investors through share buybacks. Therefore, TripAdvisor resembles a perfect setup for a turnaround. In this article, I discuss the fundamental point of view but look at technicals as well since the company has been in a three-year downtrend.The shares have been having a bearish momentum since 2014. They reached a peak of $111.24 in June 2014. And, in June this year, they made a new low of $35.34. Technically, the shares are in a three-year downtrend, and to change the trajectory, the business will need to bring better results.Source: Yahoo FinanceThe main reason why the shares declined is the deteriorating profitability.The operating margin declined from 39% in 2012 to 11% reported for 2016.Source: TripAdvisor's 10-KsFor the first half year of 2017, the profitability declined even further as the company reported the operating margin of 9.2%. The share price already reflects the lower profitability. However, in my point of view, the company is heading towards the margin expansion in the future, and this should support the price appreciation and break the three-year downtrend. The reason why I think the profitability is bottoming is mainly the outcome of the strategy implementation which resulted in higher costs.First, the management initiated an expansion to a new line of business. In 2013, the company has been primarily dependent on the revenue from hotel business.Source: TripAdvisor's 2016 10-KOn the other hand, during the first six months of 2017, the hotel segment represented 80% of the company sales.Source: TripAdvisor's 2Q 2017 Earnings ReleaseThis expansion brought down the profitability as the non-hotel stream had a negative contribution to net income and cash flow.Source: TripAdvisor's 2016 10-KAnd so, the income from the hotel has been subsidizing the non-hotel income, and the profitability has been diluted. In my point of view, this should change in upcoming years as the non-hotel business is turning positive and could eventually result in margin expansion. 2017 should be the first year when the company reports positive adjusted EBITDA for this segment whereas the segment was already profitable during the first six months of the year.Source: TripAdvisor's 2Q 2017 Earnings ReleaseSecond, the profitability decline has been also the result of investment in the new website. The management decided to change the website’s layout which resulted in higher costs for technology.Source: TripAdvisor's 2016 10-KThe new website was launched in the recent quarter, and therefore, the highest investment is already done. Thus, there should be a cost reduction going forward. On the flip side, the money needs to be spent on advertising as the management is launching a new TV promotion. The main message of the promotion is to convince the customers that they can book hotels directly on the website rather than switching to another platform. This should bring further monetization of the website which was another result of the decline in profitability. The management highlighted a couple of times that the new layout should be beneficial for the customers as they get the cheapest deal on the internet. And so, I tried the new layout recently when I was booking my latest city break vacation. I was mostly Booking.com (PCLN) user before, and so I started a search for a hotel on this platform. When I found the right hotel, I went to TripAdvisor to see whether I got the cheapest price from Booking. It turned out there was a different website offering a better deal, and so I booked the hotel through TripAdvisor’s partner website. By doing so, I saved approximately 5% of the original costs. Which was a nice surprise, considering I was prepared to spend the original price anyway. This convinced me that the new website can work and TV promotion can bring new customers to the website, particularly in the hotel business. Therefore, there should be benefits stemming from higher revenue both in hotel and non-hotel segments. And, there should be margin expansion as the new line of business turns profitable. This resembles an ideal setup for a long entry, and so, I am bullish on TripAdvisor. In addition, the company generates a lot of free cash flows even with lower profitability and trades at reasonable valuations considering a high revenue growth.Last year, the company generated $250m in free cash flow out of which $105m was used for share buybacks. For the first six months of this year, the company generated $300m in cash out of which $250m was dedicated to share buybacks. The reason why the company generated a lot of free cash in first six months of the year is the benefit from working capital which should not repeat in a second half. Nevertheless, $300m of annual free cash flow is a fair assumption, which is approximately $2.11 per share. And so, with the price of $40, the multiple is 19. In the context of possible margin expansion and high growth of revenue, this is a reasonable multiple, and the stock could be considered cheap. Also, the balance sheet is very healthy as the company holds $904m in cash and marketable securities and has only $267m in debt as of last earnings release. Therefore, TripAdvisor does have a healthy balance sheet and is generating free cash flow even with the lower profitability. And so, there seem to be many reasons to be bullish in current downtrend.TripAdvisor has been having a bearish momentum since 2014. The reason for the decline has been the decline in profitability. This has been a result of the strategic transformation to expand to non-hotel income and to change the new layout. Going forward, these strategic moves should result in margin expansion and further revenue increase. Therefore, I consider the current prices as an excellent buying opportunity. However, investors should beware that the shares are still having a bearish momentum, and therefore, the buying opportunity should be considered for investors with a long-term horizon. Nevertheless, the downside should be limited as the company generates a lot of free cash, has a healthy balance sheet, and rewards shareholders through buybacks."
4092913,102793,2017-07-31T18:30:58-04:00,"The travel industry is huge and rapidly growing, with online travel growing at an even faster pace.TripAdvisor is the world's largest online travel community, with a large, rapidly growing, and highly engaged user base.Poor execution has led to lower conversion and profitability over the past few years, but the company is taking corrective measures which are showing early signs of success.Even at what we view as depressed profitability levels, TripAdvisor is trading at an attractive x14 EBITDA.In addition, investors are benefiting from the oversight of chairman Greg Maffei, a world-class media executive and John Malone's right-hand man.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is the world’s largest online travel community, aggregating review and opinions from a community of travelers about destinations, accommodation restaurants, and activities throughout the world. It is still a relatively small player in the huge ($1.3T) and growing (5.5%) global travel market. With relatively low online penetration at 43%, online booking is growing even faster (10.5%) due to the transition from offline to online.TripAdvisor has a large and rapidly growing user base (390M monthly unique visitors, with CAGR of 20% since 2014):As a comparison, with 69M unique monthly visitors in the US only, TripAdvisor is much larger than other travel booking websites such as booking.com (Priceline’s (PCLN) largest website) with 18M, or Expedia (EXPE) at 31M.The company reports two operating segments: hotel (88% of revenues) and non-hotel (12% of revenues). Non-hotel relates to restaurants and activities and comprises Viator (the market leader in tours and activities booking), as well as TheFork (the leading restaurant platform in Europe, much like OpenTable in the US).Hotel has been generating all of TripAdvisor's EBITDA so far. As we can see on the following chart, TripAdvisor's hotel revenues have been growing at a CAGR of 13% since 2012 but have recently experienced a decline (as well as a compression in EBITDA margin), largely driven by the rollout of Instant Booking, which we will discuss later in this article.Non-hotel revenue has been growing at an impressive 75% CAGR and still has a tremendous potential given the market size and the limited competition:The non-hotel segment currently generates negative EBITDA due to massive investments to support its development, but clearly, the management really believes in its potential:The MoatWe consider that TripAdvisor has a strong moat mainly driven by the network effect. The site currently has the largest audience of all travel website across the world, with almost 390M monthly unique visitors. This figure has been growing at an impressive 20% CAGR over the last three years. This large user base helps generate a large (500M) and rapidly growing (five new contributions per second, with total contributions having grown at a 36% CAGR since 2014) catalog of user-generated content, which in turn attracts more users. The platform currently lists 1.9M accommodations, 4.3M restaurants, and almost 1M attractions. Finally, the website is available worldwide in 49 markets and 28 languages.According to a TripBarometer survey published in the company quarterly presentation, 55% of travelers decide on an accommodation using TripAdvisor - the leading percentage in front of OTAs at 45%:This platform is highly beneficial for users who can have access to very valuable and comprehensive user reviews helping them in their trip planning end-to-end, allowing them to select the best accommodation and the best attractions and tours.On the other side, business partners have access to a huge global audience and leads that are actively looking for booking accommodations or attractions.Following Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) example, TripAdvisor has a clear strategic priority on delivering the best user experience. This will of course feed its user flywheel, with happy users being more loyal and engaged with the platform and increasingly using it for its travel booking.User monetization is clearly the current weakness of TripAdvisor as the company is facing significant headwinds with the rollout of Instant Booking.Initially, TripAdvisor allowed users to review opinions and only provided links to the various OTA (booking.com, etc.), who then paid TripAdvisor for the lead it generated for them. Users had to manually open the various links to compare prices, which clearly was not the most user-friendly experience. In 2013, TripAdvisor rolled out metasearch, allowing users to directly compare prices on various OTAs on the TripAdvisor website. This made it much more easy as users did not have any more to open each website individually.Metasearch was driving good results for TripAdvisor going well for TripAdvisor, but it could be improved both for user experience and profitability:TripAdvisor therefore started to roll out Instant Booking in 2015. Instant Booking allows users to directly book an OTA offer on TripAdvisor, with TripAdvisor having a partnership with the OTA and getting paid for the booking. Management made a mistake by highlighting the Instant Booking option at all time, even when the price offered through Instant Booking was not the lowest ones among all offers, and this resulted in lower conversion rates.Management has admitted this mistake and is now offering a more balanced approach: Instant Booking is now only proposed as the first option when it offers the lowest price. Besides, for users who tend to click on several metasearch links to directly check the offers on OTA websites, TripAdvisor does not put the Instant Booking option as the first option, as this would overall generate less revenues than the combined revenues from metasearch. These changes are now yielding positive results as revenue per shopper has turned back to growth in Q1 2017 after two years of stable to negative growth:While TripAdvisor's stock price is at a low point reflecting high negativity around the company's potential, its revenue per shopper trend has reached an inflexion point and is now back in positive territory.While it is often great to own founder-led business, TripAdvisor clearly has suffered from management’s missteps and poor execution over the past few years with the Instant Booking rollout. However, and as we already mentioned, management is now implementing smart changes to its Instant Booking function that are already leading to positive results.While management has been making a few mistakes, we are very confident in its abilities as it showed that it was able to experiment, recognize its mistakes, and make changes relatively rapidly to improve conversion and monetization.More importantly, we love the fact that Liberty TripAdvisor (LTRPA), i.e. the John Malone/Greg Maffei duo, controls 21% of TripAdvisor and that Greg Maffei is the chairman of TripAdvisor. We could not dream of any better executive to oversee the company than this world-class and financially savvy media executive.Currently, TripAdvisor trades at an EV/EBITDA of x14.2. This valuation strikes us as very attractive given the quality of the company, its moat, and its growth profile, driven by the secular tailwinds from both the growth of the travel industry and the shift from offline to online booking. Not to mention the fact that we view the current profitability as depressed due to the rollout of Instant Booking, as well as significant investments in marketing and in the development of the non-hotel business. Note, however, that there is significant stock-based compensation not taken into account in the EBITDA estimate, but we estimate that they would largely be offset by any reduction in the above-mentioned expenses.A sum-of-the-part analysis tends to confirm our view of the valuation. In 2014, Priceline acquired OpenTable, the leading online restaurant booking company in the US, for $2.6B. The company was then generating $190M revenues, with a four-year revenue growth CAGR of 29%.TheFork, which is owned by TripAdvisor, is the leading online restaurant booking company in Europe and currently offers a much larger number of bookable restaurants than OpenTable. Non-hotel revenue for TripAdvisor was $290M in 2016 (with a four-year growth CAGR of 75%, much higher than OpenTable at the time of the acquisition), and while this also comprises attraction, we think it is fair to assume that attractions have roughly the same margins as restaurants. At a comparable valuation than the OpenTable acquisition - a rather conservative assumption given the growth profile of the non-hotel business (more than twice the rate of OpenTable), this would put the value of the non-hotel segment at $4.0B, or 82% of TripAdvisor's Enterprise Value.While we acknowledge that these are high-level assumptions, the hotel segment seems very cheap under any other assumption. Priceline is currently valued at x9 revenues, and while the non-hotel segment is not of the same quality as Priceline (at least currently), it has a much higher growth. Applying this x9 multiple to TripAdvisor's non-hotel segment, this would lead to the same valuation as OpenTable at the moment of its acquisition ($2.6B) and would mean that investors are currently paying x6.8 EBITDA for TripAdvisor's hotel segment - when competitors such as Expedia or Yelp (NYSE:YELP) are trading at x14 EBITDA (not to mention Priceline at x22 EBITDA).No matter how we look at it, the valuation of TripAdvisor strikes us as very attractive, especially given the firm's quality.TripAdvisor is currently one of our favorite opportunities: an excellent, high-return business with strong management, in a fast-growing industry, trading at an attractive valuation - even excluding the fact that profitability is currently depressed due to missteps in the Instant Booking rollout, marketing investments, and large growth investments in the non-hotel business.While we eagerly wait to see the future developments and trends in revenue per shopper, the company has started acting on its share repurchases plan to take advantage of the current share price."
4133707,103910,2017-08-19T07:30:00-04:00,"Long Hill Road Capital manages a long-only investment partnership focusing on businesses with competitive advantages and long growth runways that are cheap and unpopular.Managing risk in a long-only portfolio, how the right investor base is a competitive advantage and when to sell are topics discussed.Long Hill Road Capital shares a bullish thesis on TripAdvisor.","Long Hill Road Capital manages a long-only investment partnership focusing on businesses with competitive advantages and long growth runways that are cheap and unpopular. We emailed with Long Hill Road Capital about the lesson learned by “only” doubling their money in NFLX, how to determine if a company is merely unpopular or structurally impaired and a key requirement for investing in special situations.Seeking Alpha: Can you discuss how you manage risk in your long-only portfolio?Long Hill Road Capital: It is important to define “risk” before we discuss it. Most people consider stock price volatility to be risk, but I don’t agree with that. If one has a long-term perspective, risk is the likelihood of losing money on a permanent basis. So to manage risk, I therefore try to make investments that have a remote chance of incurring a permanent loss. There are two ways I try to do that. First, I buy high-quality businesses that have durable competitive advantages, long growth runways, and honest and effective management teams. I avoid companies that face serious risks related to new competition, changes in technology, and changes in consumer preferences, as well as companies that have significant levels of financial leverage. Generally speaking, if I can’t say with a high degree of confidence that a company will be much larger and more profitable 10 years from now, it is an automatic pass.Second, I try to invest in these companies when they are temporarily out of favor with the investment community and trading at prices that reflect modest long-term expectations. Typically, that occurs when they have reported a weak quarter or there is some other temporary headwind. If I can assume very muted long-term expectations for the business and still underwrite a strong double-digit annual stock price return, that can be very interesting.Another risk to manage is my own activity. Sometimes when people are watching stock prices rise and fall on a daily basis and are constantly dialed into the short-term news flow, it can be easy to overthink things and overtrade. It can be easy to try to be too clever. This can lead to mistakes. To avoid this, I think of my investments as ownership stakes in private businesses that do not trade publicly. Thinking of them in this way forces me to ignore the day-to-day fluctuations and focus solely on the things that matter to long-term business owners: revenues, profits, cash flows, capital allocation, and the risks and opportunities facing the business. The more I can think like an owner, the better the partnership’s long-term results should be.SA: Can you discuss how your investor base is a competitive advantage? On the flip side, can you discuss what happens when the investing style of the PM and the temperament (or lack thereof) of the investor base are not aligned?LHRC: I consider investing with a long-term perspective to be the biggest “edge” an investor can have these days. But managers can only invest with a long-term perspective if their investors also have a long-term perspective. If I let investors with a short-term mindset into my partnership, they would be disappointed when I inevitably report a bad quarter or year of performance. They would probably withdraw from the partnership, which would be a bad outcome for all parties. I would also never want their short-term mindset and desire for quick returns to influence my long-term investment approach.Most managers are willing to accept any type of investor because it is difficult to turn down assets. The result is they know they are judged on their very short-term performance, which causes them to target short-term returns, which are very difficult to generate consistently, and ignore longer-term opportunities. The result is that managers who have a long-term approach and an aligned investor base can capitalize on those overlooked long-term opportunities.SA: You have a longer holding period than most (5-10 years to forever) - what would cause you to sell a holding either for a profit or a loss? Have you learned any lessons (the easy or hard way) in terms of when to sell?LHRC: Forever is the ideal holding period but few investments will end up making that cut. The world changes a lot over 10 or 20 or 30 years and only the rare company will continue to thrive forever. As a result, I think of 5-10 years as the practical holding period for most of my investments.I sell my holdings for two reasons. One, the stock price becomes overvalued given the long-term expectations I’m willing to underwrite. In a good outcome, this happens when the stock price rises significantly such that the discount between my appraisal of value and the price narrows or disappears. Generally, the higher quality the business, the more flexibility I have with this. In a bad outcome, something causes me to lower my long-term expectations and appraisal of value to the point where the stock is no longer trading at a sufficient discount. With high-quality companies and reasonably good judgment on my part, good outcomes should continue to outnumber bad outcomes. The other main reason I sell is to reallocate the capital to clearly superior opportunities. It is also prudent sometimes to trim positions if the position size becomes too large.I’ve learned so many lessons over my career. At my old firm, thanks to my former partner’s insights, we made Netflix our largest position after the Quixster debacle in 2012. The stock had been decimated and sentiment was universally negative. NFLX was a 20% position at an average cost of about $70 at the time, which is about $10 in today’s terms (adjusted for the 7-for-1 split). The drumbeat that Netflix’s content costs would spiral out of control or that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was going to destroy Netflix, or one of several other bearish points was incessant. We were convinced it was all wrong. Netflix was the clear leader in a huge market, with an underpriced offering, and a visionary leader. Netflix would only have to pay $1 more than the next highest bidder for content, and given Netflix’s rapidly growing scale, there would be a very limited number of bidders who could make the economics work. Amazon was a formidable competitor but Netflix could still prosper without it being a winner-take-all market. Backing out a conservative run-off value for the DVD-by-mail business, the streaming business was trading at a ridiculous 1.2x revenue. To make a long story short, the stock doubled within about six months and we sold our whole position. Since then, the stock has appreciated another nine-fold. In hindsight, we were too rigid in our appraisal of value and too strict in our sell discipline in light of Netflix’s long-term opportunity. The lesson I learned was I should have a different sell discipline with compounder-type investments than with the lower quality businesses I used to invest in. If the same circumstances happened today, I would trim the outsized position after it doubled but maintain a more modest 5-8% position for the long-term.SA: How do you identify when a company is simply unpopular (with the fundamentals still being intact) rather than structurally impaired? What key factors do you look for? Can you give examples of each?LHRC: That is the big challenge, and it is always a case-by-case basis. I ask myself if the headwinds facing a company are likely to be transitory or could they be permanent. For example, I think the headwinds facing many bricks ‘n mortar retail companies are likely to be permanent given Amazon and the long-term structural tailwinds of e-commerce. I am very reluctant to invest in any retailer not named Amazon for this reason. That might cause me to miss some opportunities, but I think it will also cause me to avoid a lot of mistakes. Today, the auto parts retailers are trading at low headline multiples and some consider them cheap. That’s possible, but I worry about the long-term impact on these businesses from electric vehicles, which have far fewer parts. It seems like only a matter of time before all cars are electric. Given value is the present value of future free cash flow, I find businesses like these difficult to value given my ignorance of their futures. That doesn’t mean they aren’t good investments right now; I just don’t know.On the flip side, we invested in Amazon in 2014. It was very out-of-favor and unpopular at the time because the market failed to distinguish between operating losses and aggressive investment spending. The sell-side proclaimed that investors would “throw in the towel” on Jeff Bezos and his “long-term” business approach. Amazon was an unprofitable “charitable organization” run for the benefit of consumers, not a profit-making business, one journalist wrote. We disagreed. We understood that Amazon was investing an enormous sum of money in a dizzying array of growth opportunities and most of these investments were running through its income statement, depressing current reported earnings. Amazon’s long-term future was extraordinarily bright, given its unsurmountable competitive advantages and e-commerce’s single-digit share of U.S. retail sales and an even lower share around the world. We talked with a former employee of Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) who educated us on Amazon’s dominance and long-term opportunity in the global public cloud market, which has an estimated total addressable market of over $1 trillion.This was a clear example of a business with intact fundamentals and a bright future that was simply temporarily unpopular because it was reporting operating losses. Amazon had 8-9% operating margins in its North America segment about a decade earlier, so I asked myself whether Amazon had become grossly more inefficient in North America despite literally having 17x the revenue, or whether it was more likely just reinvesting its profits into growth, depressing margins. Fulfillment centers only ramp up over a few years to reach mature contribution profits, new category expansion causes losses at first, and hiring thousands upon thousands of people causes expenses to grow before they contribute to revenue. The answer was clear to me. Amazon's stock has more than tripled since then, and it remains a core long-term holding.SA: You make a compelling SOTP case in your initiation and update on TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) - can you walk us through why this opportunity exists and the catalysts to close the discount to intrinsic value? If the mispricing persists for much longer, do you expect a strategic or even financial acquirer to act?LHRC: TripAdvisor’s stock is trading very cheaply for a number of reasons. From a high level, this is a stock that has fallen over 60% from its 2014 high. There have been numerous bullish cases made since then and all have been wrong or too early. Management was very optimistic about Instant Booking’s prospects, which have failed to pan out so far. Pushing Instant Booking on users despite it not offering the lowest hotel prices caused user monetization to fall significantly. When user monetization falls, the company dials back its marketing spending due to ROI hurdles, so there was a dual headwind to revenue growth. The company is also facing a headwind from the mix shift of its users to mobile users from desktop or tablet. Mobile users monetize at a much lower level, which causes a headwind to revenue growth. Despite the company’s struggles, TRIP still trades a high headline P/E multiple, which many investors, wrongly in my opinion, focus on. The optically high valuation, the headwinds the company is facing, and management’s missteps have created intense skepticism among most market participants. Short interest is 18% of the float, and the sell-side is very pessimistic with just 3 buy ratings, 19 hold ratings, and 5 sell ratings.As far as catalysts, I believe value - if you’re right about it - becomes its own catalyst. That said, the company has appeared to have turned a corner after lapping the Instant Booking headwinds. In the hotel segment, user monetization in the U.S. is back to “pre-IB” levels and the company is increasing its marketing spending again, which should provide a dual tailwind to U.S. hotel revenues. The overlooked non-hotel business is on fire, growing 35% last quarter on a constant-currency basis, and is turning profitable this year. The non-U.S. hotel business has been improving and appears to have returned to modest growth last quarter. Importantly, mobile monetization increased 8% in the first quarter and around 19% last quarter, so the headwind from the mix shift to mobile is being offset by improving mobile monetization and rapidly growing mobile users. On a long-term basis, the mix shift to mobile could be transformational for TripAdvisor as mobile monetization increases because mobile user acquisition costs are so low; repeat app usage is free, a portion of mobile web users are free due to the organic content draw, and the paid portion of mobile web costs less per click than desktop. Finally, the company redesigned its website and app to be much cleaner and focus more on hotel price comparison features, which is what drives monetization, and launched a $150 million annual television ad campaign, highlighting the fact that TripAdvisor now searches over 200 other sites to find you the lowest price on your ideal hotel. Management is seeing early signs of success with this campaign, and I believe hotel revenue growth should accelerate next year as a result.My preferred way to illustrate the mispricing here is to value the non-hotel segment first. This is a business with incredible long-term economics, especially the attractions business, and is firing on all cylinders. It has high user monetization not unlike the hotel OTAs, yet it also has the low user acquisition costs that TripAdvisor has, thanks to its content and heavy app usage in-destination. That could cause this business to have operating margins well north of 50% one day. I value the non-hotel segment at $2.3 billion or more today. When I back that out of the current enterprise value of around $5.3 billion, it implies that the core hotel business is trading for $3.0 billion. That is close to 2x revenue or around 13x EBITDA (including stock-based compensation as a real expense; ex-SBC and it is under 10x adjusted EBITDA). Given the company’s advantaged competitive position in the structurally growing online travel market, its massive user base, and its attractive long-term economics, that is a clear bargain.If the mispricing persists, it is possible the company could be acquired by one of several larger Internet companies. There are actually a couple signs that jumped out at me as indicating a possible acquisition could be in the works. Admittedly, this is speculative and not part of my investment rationale.First, the company bought back stock aggressively at $50, $42, and $39 over the last three quarters, but has recently failed to authorize a new buyback plan when the former one was fully utilized. I can only think of two good reasons why this might be. One, the company is saving its cash for a decent-sized acquisition, or two, it cannot authorize a new plan to repurchase shares because it is in talks to potentially sell the company, which is material non-public information (“MNPI”). The company could continue buying under its last authorization in May and June because it repurchases under a 10b5-1 plan, which allows it to repurchase shares even if it comes into possession of MNPI. But I highly doubt the company could actively authorize a new plan when in possession of MNPI.Second, the company disclosed in its last 10-Q filing that it adopted a new executive severance plan that would come into play if a change in control occurred. This does not guarantee the company is sold anytime soon, but it is definitely eyebrow-raising. Boards do not go to the trouble for no reason. I have seen a company adopt a similar amendment to its change-in-control compensation terms and get acquired six weeks later.While an acquisition is possible, I would prefer the company to remain independent and continue to compound its value over 5-10 years. That said, if the takeover price is high enough and shareholders could at least have the option of receiving shares in the acquiring company, I could support it.When I step back, I see TRIP as a one-way bet. If the hotel business accelerates over the next few years, as I expect, I think the stock price will be a multi-bagger over time. If the hotel business fails to reaccelerate despite management’s best efforts, which I don’t expect, I think Liberty TripAdvisor, the controlling shareholder, would entertain offers for the company. Potential bidders include Priceline (PCLN), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Ctrip (CTRP), Airbnb (AIRB), Amazon, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and others. TripAdvisor Chairman Greg Maffei even highlighted the potential bidders at the Deutsche Bank conference in February. Given multiple bidders and a truly one-of-a-kind asset, I would expect any acquisition in the near term to occur at a price approaching $100 per share, or more than double its current price of $41 per share. So in a good outcome, we’ll make multiples on our money over the next several years; in a bad outcome, we would more than double our money. I have seen worse odds than that.SA: As it relates to your thesis on Dover Motorsports (NYSE:DVD) and in general, can you discuss how you analyze the mispricing and implied probabilities of certain strategies (merger arb, special situations, etc.) to determine where the market may have it wrong?LHRC: I no longer invest in a lot of special situations, but the key is to invest at a price that either provides a good return in a short period of time or a flat return at worst. Merger arb is not something that provides a flat return at worst, so that doesn’t interest me.With the Dover Motorsports thesis, the company had announced the sale of its very valuable non-core real estate, and the stock had jumped before falling back to the prior unaffected price. If the real estate was sold at the terms specified, the stock would have soared; if the sale did not go through, I felt the stock price had limited, if any, downside, given the valuation and the fact that the stock had fallen back to the unaffected price. The company now appears to only be selling a fraction of its real estate, not the whole parcel, so the stock is flat to down slightly.A special situation I was involved in years ago was Gyrodyne (NASDAQ:GYRO). To make a long story short, if it was awarded the damages it was due in court, the stock would double. We looked at the case, we hired an attorney who specialized in the relevant aspects of the law, we attended the key court session. It was clear to us that the case was very lopsided in Gyrodyne’s favor, such that there was a high likelihood the stock would double and minimal downside if it did not. In the end, the company was paid the damages it was due and the stock soared, but our very long holding period made the return only average.I focus on compounders today because I find it minimizes mistakes, lets me compound capital for years in a tax-efficient manner, and I avoid the constant challenge of finding something else intelligent to do with sale proceeds.***Thanks to Long Hill Road Capital for the interview.

4098868,103537,2017-08-14T21:14:03-04:00,Reviewing growth potential for TripAdvisor.Analyzing its financials and balance sheet.Assessing market share gains and analyzing the travel industry.,"TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has taken a severe beating since its highs back in mid-2014 where its stock price hit an all-time high of $111.24 a share. We believe that a combination of severe competition from major travel coordinators, the stagnation of travel costs and poor management execution of profitability and conversion were the major catalysts for the stock shedding over 62% of its value as of Friday's closing price of $42.18 a share.In recent years, however, we witnessed a solid uptick in travel with an increase of booked flights and accommodations around the globe as price wars, consolidation and lower oil prices allowed airlines to reduce the overall price of travel to an affordable range for a significant portion of the world's population.The 2016 20-Year Passenger Forecast study finds that air travelers are set to nearly double by 2035, according to The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which expects 7.2 billion passengers to travel in 2035 when compared to the 3.8 billion air travelers in 2016. The prediction is based on a 3.7% annual Compound Average Growth Rate (CAGR). And with an increase in air travel comes an increase in accommodations, which will help fuel the travel industry further.This is one reason many people are speculating why Warren Buffett, a renowned anti-airline investor who supports the ""How to become a Millionaire? Become a Billionaire and then buy an airline"" joke to hold nearly $10B worth of airlines including Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Continental (NYSE:UAL) as per the companies' latest 13F release and Friday, August 12th closing prices.  TripAdvisor enjoys being the number one visited site in the travel & tourism industry. It is ranked far ahead of its direct competitors with over 165M visits every month to its website, outpacing its closest competitors such as Airbnb (AIRB) (77M monthly visits), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) (60M monthly visits) and Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN) (30M monthly visits), with direct bookings. TripAdvisor has something else going for it. The company specializes in providing information for travelers not only related to booking flights and accommodations but on crowdsourced and direct-business data on ""Things to do,"" ""Attractions,"" ""Wining and Dining"" and others that are available to its users as an all-in-one package when they download their mobile application or research their trip prior to their departure online. We believe this is a significant plus for the company with the change in consumer habits to favor an all-in-one platform over having several different sources for their travel needs.Air TravelWith a saturated domestic market, airlines have recently revamped their efforts to cheapen international flights and consumers are picking the chance to see the world.TripAdvisor is by far not the strongest player in the air travel industry, being led by companies like Priceline, Expedia and Orbitz Worldwide which enjoy market domination with direct-booking. Although, with its 2016 partnership with Expedia it became a leading entity for flight booking, allowing the link to all the world's largest flight booking websites.Hotels and AccommodationsWith the increase in air travel comes the increase in accommodations. However, the hotel industry has taken a hit from the likes of AirBnB and other smaller platforms in recent years, yet we believe that the mainstream accommodation options will continue to dominate the market for years to come with consumer preferences.Like with air travel, TripAdvisor does not enjoy a market dominating position in accommodation bookings, which belong to Priceline's Booking.com; but with the help of the aforementioned 2016 partnership with Expedia, we believe it will be gaining market share and showing solid increases in bookings referrals throughout the years to come. Food & DiningTripAdvisor has a unique position in the international food and dining market due to the consumer preferences and vast amount of crowdsourced data that it provides through hundreds of thousands of annual visits to the businesses and dining venues it offers on the web and mobile application version of its services.The risks here remains clear with a stiff competition from the likes of Yelp (NYSE:YELP), GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) all fighting for market share. We expect revenue growth to remain relatively low and steady in the years to come until some consolidation may take place.Activity RecommendationAlthough still a smaller market than air travel and accommodations, recommendations are a growing market domestically and internationally and TripAdvisor enjoys a healthy market share and is gaining further ground with new product launches and the overall adaptation of its product offerings.Here too, stiff competition from the likes of Yelp and the aforementioned companies are a downer for its revenue growth in this particular stream. It is yet to be seen if its new services and the client base it attracts from air travel and accommodations can lure businesses to favor advertising on its platform vs. its competitors and will remain in close watch.The main risk facing TripAdvisor is an increase in competition. New websites and mobile applications are coming up in hope of capturing some of the $7.6T global travel market and risk capturing it from TripAdvisor rather than some of the smaller players.Another risk is bigger players which already have an existing travel and tourism platform venturing into the all-inclusive Travel, Accommodation, Dining and Recommendations business. Like every industry, eventually, the bigger players look to consolidate in order to maintain a lead and this very well might happen in the near future.On a purely speculative note, it will eventually make sense for companies like Priceline and Expedia to look into companies like GrubHub, Groupon and Yelp to expand their reach in the industry and increase revenue streams.We believe the company will continue innovation and its current wealth of information will keep it fairly immune to smaller players entering the arena in the foreseeable future, but remain weary on the prospect of larger players venturing into the all-inclusive market. We will wait and look for news on the matter.A look at the company's financials further emphasizes the recent shift in trends of consumer spending behavior for favoring a one-in-all system. After a period of contraction in sales growth, we see an uptick in stability and growth expectations looking forward.As seen by sales figures from 2014, where its price peaked, throughout expectations for FY 2017 and FY 2018, analysts and the company are more optimistic regarding its growth prospects and market penetration.With sales growth prospects back in place, we believe it will further accelerate throughout 2018 and 2019.Looking at profitability and margins from 2014 through expectations for FY 2017 and FY 2018, we see a return to growth pattern emerging through 2017 and earnings growth estimates have TripAdvisor returning to solid earnings growth from 2018 onward, although still lower than its 2014/5 profitability.We believe that once sales growth is back in full swing and market share is gained, TripAdvisor will tackle the issue of margins and profitability through reducing cost, increasing operational efficiency and possibly taking another look at increasing shareholder value through dividend and buybacks.We believe that TripAdvisor's gaining market share, its potential for new and existing market penetration and the overall higher demand for travel-related products will generate a steady increase in revenues and profits.Although some risk remains with stiff competition in the industry and new players emerging every day, we believe that TripAdvisor will remain an industry leader and prove to have the advantage of an all-in-one product offering that will attract new customers and prove well for customer retention."
4086716,69905,2017-07-10T14:26:41-04:00,"The market has been unimpressed with TripAdvisor, but management's strategic focus is starting to pay off.TripAdvisor has a strong balance sheet.There is large margin of safety at the current price.","Investment ThesisIt has been slightly more than 5 months since I previously discussed the opportunity presented in TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). I was tentatively optimistic before at that price, now, at approximately $5 billion market cap, the market is becoming irrational and creating an opportunity for bargain hunters. The article that follows contains recent business highlights, financials, an assessment of its balance sheet, followed by valuation work and finishes by discussing investment risks.Recent Business HighlightsTripadvisor has two operating segments, which are, Hotel and Non-Hotel segment. Its Hotel segment contributes just over 84% of consolidated revenue. Its non-hotel segment, which includes attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals is a much smaller contributor to overall revenue at approximately 15%.TripAdvisor ended 2017 Q1 with revenue up 6% YoY. However, this growth did not permeate down the income statement as its non-GAAP EPS ended being down 27% from $0.33 in 2016 Q1 to $0.24 in 2017 Q1.TripAdvisor's U.S. segment stood in 2017 Q1 and was up 14% YoY. This revenue increase was driven by an increase in revenue per hotel shopper as well as an increase in the percentage of traffic from paid marketing channels. Since this is management's top strategic goal, it's nice to see it being reflected in hard numbers. However, its display-based advertising within its Hotel segment has been a drag to TripAdvisor's performance, see table below.TripAdvisor has not been maximizing its revenue in display-based advertising. And while management has made clear that advertising is not a priority for the management team, it is nevertheless is a source of revenue which could offer the company additional leverage to offset its corporate running costs. Moreover, the company's brand could actually strengthen and be a downstream beneficiary from management's further optimization efforts to increase the return on investment which online travel agencies (OTA) get from using TripAdvisor's platform. While the travel industry is certainly not a winner-take-all industry as it remains very fragmented, display-based advertising is still an avenue which TripAdvisor is not fully leveraging.As for its Non-Hotel segment, on the back end of its two acquisitions, Viator and LaFourchette, the non-hotel segment delivered meaningful growth of 18% YoY. However, this segment is not profitable as its adjusted EBITDA came in at minus $15 million and the management team under Mr. Kaufer should first stabilize these results, then successfully turn a profit before seeking to demonstrate growth. If TripAdvisor's share price had not been underperforming the S&P 500 by more than 50% in the past year alone, the market could possibly tolerant of its non-profitable ventures but that is not the case, as demonstrated by the pessimism surrounding TRIP's share price. FinancialsSource: Morningstar.com; author's calculation; author's calculationWhile TripAdvisor has superb returns on invested capital as well as strong FCF margin of 20% (highlighted) green the market is disillusioned with the lack of growth this fallen angel now shows. In the past 5 years, TripAdvisor has had a CAGR of 18%, however, its latest results - 6% YoY - do not inspire much confidence that this company can return to those rates anytime soon. The company has chosen to invest in better marketing to reposition itself as the go-to platform for users wishing to not only research hotels on but actually book their hotels through TripAdvisor. Financial PositionIn the last 6 months, TripAdvisor has increased its debt position by a meaningful $39 million. Since TripAdvisor holds approximately 82% of its cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities overseas this might be more a move to borrow cash when it not really necessary and as such more of a precautionary measure, to weather any upcoming storms and offer TripAdvisor some additional financial flexibility. Furthermore, the $210m it currently holds in debt is very much in line with its historical average. Overall, TripAdvisor has a net cash position of $539 million, so this debt while worthwhile being aware of is not particularly meaningful. Valuation relative to Peer GroupSource: Morningstar.com; author's calculationThe table above shows a mixed picture. On a P/Cash Flow it shows that the peer group is trading at a small discount to its trailing 5-year average. However, TRIP's valuation on both a P/Cash Flow and P/Sales ratio is trading at a meaningful discount to its trailing 5-year average. These findings are reinforced below in my DCF valuation. DCF ValuationI performed a back-of-the-envelope DCF analysis with a $276 million of FCF (normalized for the last three fiscal years), with 8% growth over the next five years (which is significantly less than its 5 CAGR of 18%) before leveling off at 5% (which is I consider it to be modest and a realistic growth rate for an online, asset-light company). I then discounted this FCF back at 8%. I used 8%, which is a smaller than standard equity discount rate, because, on the one hand, it is difficult to forecast just how successful TripAdvisor's management will be at implementing this business model move towards better monetizing its platform, but on the other hand, TripAdvisor does have a net cash position of more than $0.5 billion - 10% of its market cap.This brings the DCF to approximately $11 billion, which is a large discount to what it currently trades for.Investment RisksIn my mind, the main concern I have is that consumers have been a migrating away from TripAdvisor and using other companies for booking their vacations. While not a direct comparison, AirBnB is certainly flourishing well and it does to a small extent, encroach on TripAdvisor's market share. Another problem I have found with using TripAdvisor's business model is that there is no loyalty among its users base. Meaning that a user can spend a lot of time researching hotels on TripAdvisor, sometimes spending a significant amount of time to ensure the best holiday experience. Once the user has committed a large amount of time towards finding the best value for money holiday, it is only a few more clicks online to find that same holiday selling elsewhere online cheaper. In fact, the kind of user that would spend time researching hotels online before going for a week's break somewhere will often have a lot of pleasure from spending some time online trying to find the cheapest price. This is a flaw in TripAdvisor's business model which the company is obviously trying to address through its commitment towards making TripAdvisor a great place to find the lowest prices when a user is ready to book. Moreover, TripAdvisor does generate a significant amount of revenue through advertisements, where companies pay for leads through TripAdvisor. However, as an advertising company, I would much prefer to deploy my capital investing in a company where I get maximum return on investment. TripAdvisor obviously competes against Priceline for advertisement from online travel agencies but also competes for advertisements with indirect competitors such as Facebook. Facebook is a company with outstanding network effects, where a quarter of the world's population are monthly active users, with great advertisement capabilities which it is able to offer advertisers great leads through its ability to segment its user base particularly well.ConclusionOverall, TripAdvisor's market valuation is cheap. My main concern in Tripadvisor's business model is that it is not particularly successful at monetizing its website. Its Alexa ranking is 235 globally and 70 in the U.S. This shows that the company has a tremendous amount of volume through its website, and if the company is able to improve its monetization of this volume, which I have little doubts it could do with the right management time, in time this well-known company will not be trading for a valuation of just $5 billion. Of course, it difficult to see now just how successful TripAdvisor will be able to modify its business model, with better marketing being one approach management highlighted, but there again investors are not been asked to pay for the opportunity that this growth does materialize. And if substantial revenue growth does not, in fact, materialise its shareholders can fall back on TripAdvisor's strong balance for share price support.

4054537,22675,2017-03-13T10:15:25-04:00,"TRIP remains one of the more unique attractive players in the travel space thanks to its community.The company went through a painful transition into Instant Booking that put pressure on revenues growth but is finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.While the IB transition is not over, TRIP's current valuation has little downside given where it's trading and being a potential target for bigger travel players.","Over the past couple of years, one of the stocks I've been most wrong about has been TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). When I look at my long term speculative picks, TRIP is clearly the worst pick and I decided to take an in-depth look to get a fresh look at the social travel network. Unsurprisingly, I found both reasons for optimism and for concern.The GoodThe one overwhelmingly positive part of TripAdvisor is its incredible community of members. Despite being a smaller player, TRIP does have the top community of travelers and remains the dominant spot for them to decide on travel options.source: TRIP 2016Q4 slidesTraffic continues to grow as does engagement and while those do not directly translate into revenues and profits, they do make TRIP an incredibly valuable property that competes on more than price. Making the case for TRIP over competitors such as Priceline (PCLN), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) or others is straightforward both from a user and merchant perspective.credit: SemrushThe trend in Monthly Unique Visitors is strong and accelerating growth to 35% Y/Y to over 350M users.The BadIt's easy to find areas of concern for TripAdvisor and the shift to mobile has been a big one. While some web players such as Facebook have been able to run a fairly smooth transition, that has not been the case for TRIP which continues to depend on advertising for a large portion of its revenues. In the past, TRIP has been known to generate 3 times less per view on mobile than desktop, prompting concerns from investors which are not being met head on by the management:The shift to mobile is not a new phenomena and TRIP clearly needs to do better here.TrafficTraffic and engagement for TRIP are very high but there's clearly a challenge in getting to new potential clients. In terms of search engine traffic, TRIP is still engaged in its war (with YELP and others) against Google. Then there's the challenge of competing with much bigger players such as EXPE and PCLN. One of the more recent analyst downgrades by Needham & Company used that argument stating that even if TRIP spends 100% of their 2017 projected revenue of $1.6B, this would be less than half PCLN's or EXPE's marketingThe UglyOh, did you think those were the worst parts? I wish it was but this is where it gets worse. TRIP has been trying to do too many things at once which will tend to happen when competing with global players such as PCLN and EXPE. First off, in terms of offerings, TRIP went from being a place focused on hotels to adding vacation rentals, acquiring La Fourchette (restaurants), Viator for attractions. Don't get me wrong, these all make sense in offering a complete offering to its travelers but becomes a massive problem if the company struggles to execute on its objectives.I've written about Amazon and I think one of the keys is its ability to focus on a 10-20 year horizon. From that perspective, TripAdvisor's move to instant booking would be a smart one. When TRIP decided to go that route, it was going to reduce its reliance on advertising dollars and instead start getting a cut of every reservation. The issue, of course, is that it would result in a short-term loss as it implemented that. One problem is that it has taken much longer and been more painful than initially expected. Another, of course, is that TRIP is no Amazon. It does not have side businesses that can subsidize its longer term project which ended up putting tremendous pressure on the company despite scoring big wins such as signing Expedia and Marriott as IB partners. Don't get me wrong, I do think this very well could be a great long-term move but I'm certainly not as convinced as I was 1-2 years ago. There is something to be said for focusing on core strengths.The consequences have been dramatic. Despite increased traffic, engagement, the company is seeing very little if any growth in revenues and earnings leading analysts to downgrade the stock: Analyst ratings:credit: YahooRocky Road AheadA somewhat depressing perspective is that this extremely difficult transition towards Instant Booking is far from done. It is mostly finished in the US and will now roll throughout the world. That is likely to keep growth and gross margins under pressure for some time even if the company can continue improving its conversion ratios.There Is No Turning BackThe Upside Is SignificantAll of this being said, I do find TRIP's current valuation extremely attractive. At a minimum, it does seem to me that TRIP is approaching its price capping downside risk significantly. No, I'm not saying that based off of comments made by chairman Greg Maffei although the fact that the stock saw a 5.6% uptick following the comments does give it some credibility. Rather, I'm saying this because, in terms of valuation relative to sales, TRIP is an attractive target. Add to that the fact that TRIP is unique in the sector in terms of its community and the #merchants that are connected to its service (especially when you include restaurants and attractions) and you can easily imagine both Priceline and Expedia (how ironic would that be) considering buying it if its valuations come down further. I could also very well imagine Airbnb making a play for TRIP at these levels (likely only after it goes public) to help better compete as it tries to expand its offering.More importantly though, I am convinced that the upside is very significant. As the top travel community, TRIP will hopefully have Instant Booking rolled out worldwide soon and be able to get back to growth. While the hit following the rollout has been very significant, it's difficult to argue that if successful, the potential upside for TRIP will be significant and could help TRIP become a 3rd dominant global internet travel player. Given the valuations that you can see below, even getting to that level would bring TRIP significantly higher. How? Once IB rollout is final, I do expect both revenues and earnings growth to accelerate which should bring its current valuation more in-line."
4084617,101969,2017-06-29T14:18:28-04:00,Widely ignored Non-Hotel segment is likely worth over 40% of the current enterprise value.U.S. Hotel business is back to running on all cylinders and is probably worth entire enterprise value or more.Robust growth and health of U.S. Hotel business is overlooked because it is consolidated with recently underperforming non-U.S. Hotel business.Non-U.S. Hotel business is priced at a large negative value in the market today. Extreme valuation will not persist indefinitely.,"At $36.49 per share, TripAdvisor’s common stock (NASDAQ:TRIP) is an incredible long-term investment. Much ink has been spilled about TripAdvisor, including by me, so I will get right to the point.TRIP is now absurdly cheap. I will support this claim later by highlighting the value of two parts of TripAdvisor’s business: the Non-Hotel business and the U.S. portion of the Hotel business.But first, I’ll address the current situation, what the market thinks, and why it is wrong.TripAdvisor’s business is clearly improving. When the company reported its first-quarter report on May 7, it revealed several positive signs.The morning after the company reported 1Q 2017 earnings on May 10th, TRIP spiked from a prior close of $46.92 per share to an intraday high of $50.95 per share (+8.6% intraday). I thought it was pretty clearly a solid quarter with substantial progress made in all facets of the business with an aggressive share repurchase to boot. However, the stock shortly went into reverse, closing at $47.99 that day (+2.3%), and subsequently traded down to $44.30 at the close on May 21st.I attribute that to a couple items that short-term traders considered negative.First, management said not to extrapolate 1Q growth in hotel shoppers and revenue per hotel shopper into 2Q. While they still expect double-digit click-based and transaction revenue growth for 2017, it will temporarily pull back a bit in 2Q before accelerating in the second half. Given that Wall Street is incessantly short-term oriented, prospects for a near-term slowdown in revenue growth contributed to stock’s weakness.Second, and this is likely the bigger factor, management said while they are spending $70 - $80 million on the television brand campaign in the second half of this year, that is only for the U.S. and a handful of other big markets and only for a half year. It is fair to assume the company will spend a larger amount in 2018. Management expects near-term returns on that spending to be negative while being substantially positive longer term. This created significant uncertainty about 2018 Hotel segment earnings. Given that most of the investment community focuses on near-term results and hates uncertainty, I think this was the biggest factor behind the weakness in the stock.Then fast forwarding to May 22nd, TripAdvisor management made an appearance at the J.P. Morgan conference. While they had previously said 2Q revenue growth would slow down from the 1Q pace, they put a finer point on that by saying to expect mid-single digit to high-single digit growth in click-based and transaction revenue for 2Q. (This is due to 2Q having a more difficult year-over-year comp than 1Q, the testing of the new site in 2Q, which is initially dilutive, international Hotel is recovering more slowly, and the pull back of some of their less efficient online marketing occurred in 2Q (in order to reallocate to spending to television).) However, they again reiterated double-digit growth in click-based and transaction revenue growth for the full-year 2017. In addition, they said the television spending should be profitable in “a few years.” A few years is an eternity to the stock market.The result? The company’s stock slid from a prior close of $44.30 to $42.97 by the close of that day and continued to fall to an intraday low of $35.34 on June 21st as sell-side analysts saw the stock price weakness and invented reasons that would justify it, downgrading and lowering their price targets.Incredibly, the decline in the stock from $44.30 before the J.P. Morgan conference to $35.34 is a $1.3 billion decline in the market value of the company. What new news could possibly justify that? The point about 2Q revenue growth temporarily slowing from the 1Q pace was not new news. They had already said that on the 1Q call. Yes, they quantified it by saying mid-single to high-single digit revenue growth but that couldn’t have been much different than what was already widely assumed after management pointed out the 2Q slowdown on the 1Q call just 12 days earlier.If the consensus had been expecting say 10% click-based and transaction revenue growth in 2Q (a slowdown from the 11.6% rate in 1Q) and now they had to adjust that to say 6%, we are talking about a difference in 2Q revenue of $8 million. That is less than 2% of the company’s 2Q revenue. The contribution profit on that $8 million is probably around $5 million pre-tax and just over $3 million after-tax. For perspective, this is a company with an enterprise value of $4.7 billion and an intrinsic value much higher than that. Essentially, the market incorporated this ~$3 million lower after-tax profit in 2Q than was previously expected and sold the stock off by $1.3 billion. By doing so, the market effectively capitalized the ~$3 million shortfall at a 400x multiple. Yes, 400x.There is no other new information from that conference appearance that could have been construed negatively. The CFO did say the television spending would turn profitable “in a few years,” but he had already said it would be ROI negative in the short-term and “very much ROI positive” in the long term during the 1Q call 12 days earlier. Most of the investment community would not distinguish between “long term” and “a few years,” so I don’t think this was a factor in the stock’s $1.3 billion slide.So the commentary about 2Q is the only explanation for the stock’s big slide, which is absurd. Again, by taking the stock down by $1.3 billion, the market capitalized the $3 million of lower 2Q earnings at a 400x multiple. On what planet does this make sense? I’m no astronomer but I know there is no planet on which that makes sense.I actually took more positive things out of the J.P. Morgan conference than negative.Bigger PictureAt a higher level, I think the biggest fear in the market about TripAdvisor is the size of the potential 2018 television spending, how much it could negatively impact 2018 earnings, and the uncertainty and timing of positive returns on that spending.First, I understand the fear and the market hates uncertainty more than anything. However, there is nothing that says 2018 television losses (TV spending less incremental revenues from TV times contribution margin) cannot be offset by cutbacks elsewhere or more Non-Hotel profits. Clearly, the $70-$80 million of TV spending in this year’s second half is being offset by cuts in less efficient online marketing and higher than expected Non-Hotel profits. The company would seem to have the same opportunity to fund that same level of spending in 1H 2018 from those two buckets. In addition, there are likely other sources of funds as well given the company has an annual selling and marketing line approaching $900 million. So I don’t think it is at all a certainty that 2018 Hotel earnings have to be significantly lower than 2017 Hotel earnings.Furthermore, one should not overly emphasize one year’s earnings in valuing any company. The value of a business is the present value of all future cash flows, and in most cases, the vast majority of a company’s value is attributable to its cash flows in distant years. So even if 2018 Hotel earnings do end up a bit lower, so what? It is clearly temporary and insignificant to the company's valuation.Second, TripAdvisor’s stock closed at $52.70 right before it reported 4Q 2016 earnings on February 15th and disclosed that it would likely begin a big television marketing campaign. It is now trading at $36.49 so the whole company is now apparently worth about $2.4 billion less. The biggest cause of this is pretty clearly the television spending and its size and uncertain returns because all the company’s metrics have been improving. So let’s run some numbers. They could potentially spend up to $200 million on television next year. To be completely ridiculous, let’s say they see absolutely zero revenue benefits from it such that the money spent is a complete loss. After-tax that would be a $130 loss. They would essentially be lighting that cash on fire. Given that there has been nothing materially negative learned since February 15th, what does the $2.4 billion change in market value suggest? It suggests they will light $130 million on fire for about 18 years. However, that is undiscounted. If I use a 10% discount rate, the company would have to light $240 million on fire for 50 years to justify a $2.4 billion decline in value. You would not be wrong to think the market has overreacted to this uncertainty about the size and return profile of the 2018 television spending.ValuationTo illustrate how cheap TRIP is now, I’ll first value the overlooked Non-Hotel segment. Exhibit 1 shows TripAdvisor’s current capitalization.The Non-Hotel BusinessI think the Non-Hotel business is worth in the neighborhood of $1.9 billion, which I estimate using a 20-year DCF. This equates to 5.1x this year's estimated revenue. Non-Hotel is made up of three high return businesses that are collectively growing revenue at a mid-20s rate and have large addressable markets. TripAdvisor's Viator is the clear market leader in what PhoCusWright estimates is an $80 billion addressable market. Each Non-Hotel business can grow for a long time and should have substantial margins at scale. If this business were private and VC-backed it would likely be valued much higher than $1.9 billion today.In Exhibit 2, I back out the estimated value of the Non-Hotel piece to arrive at the implied valuation of the Hotel business.So TripAdvisor's main business looks like it is available in the market for $2.7 billion. That is a paltry sum for the world's largest travel site with 150+ million monthly unique hotel shoppers and attractive long-term growth opportunities. Exhibit 3 puts some basic valuation metrics around this $2.7 billion figure.TripAdvisor's core Hotel business is available for 2.1x revenue, 14.1x EBIT, 10.6x EBITDA (real EBITDA counting stock-based compensation as a real expense), or a 4.8% NOPAT yield. These are all extremely low multiples considering the high quality of TripAdvisor's business, its well-entrenched competitive moat, its long-term and high return growth profile, the extent to which the company is currently underearning, and its strategic value to one of many potential acquirers. I could stop there because that this valuation is screaming cheap to me for this incredible asset.The U.S. Hotel BusinessBut let's go another step and value the U.S. Hotel business. To estimate U.S. Hotel revenue, the key variables are 1) U.S. hotel shoppers, 2) U.S. revenue per hotel shopper, and 3) the U.S. portion of display, subscription, and other revenue. Management doesn't explicitly break out U.S. versus non-U.S. by segment but has given some clues.On U.S. hotel shoppers, we know about one-third of total hotel shoppers are attributable to the U.S.The next variable is U.S. revenue per hotel shopper. What do we know about this? Management recently stated that the U.S. Hotel business is back to double-digit revenue growth, including ""over 20%"" growth earlier this year, and that revenue per hotel shopper in the U.S. is back to ""pre-Instant Booking"" levels.Revenue per hotel shopper pre-IB was about $0.60 just before the IB rollout began and averaged $0.56 for the full 2014 year.Exhibit 5 shows the math behind my estimate that U.S. revenue per hotel shopper was about $0.85 pre-IB. We know U.S. hotel shopper mix is about 33% and we know about half of click-based and transaction revenue is attributable to the U.S. so the algebra leads us to $0.42 for non-U.S. and $0.85 for U.S. This makes sense because international CPCs are lower than U.S. CPCs due to lower hotel ADRs as well as a higher mix of lower monetizing mobile traffic outside the U.S.That leads me to Exhibit 6 and 2017. Plugging in 586 million U.S. hotel shoppers and a range of $0.80 - $0.90 for U.S. revenue per hotel shopper (it is back to pre-IB levels but there could be some variability), I estimate U.S. click-based and transaction revenue of $469 - $527 million. I add half of display, subscription, and other revenue to that to reach U.S. hotel revenue of $690 - $749 million.Next, I consider that Hotel adjusted EBITDA margin was 42% in 2014. I think the U.S. and non-U.S. portions of the Hotel business probably had similar margins at the time (the U.S. has both higher monetization and higher traffic acquisition costs), but today the U.S. business probably has much better margins than non-U.S. due to currency, more unfavorable mobile mix shift outside the U.S., and other factors. All things considered, I estimate the U.S. Hotel business could have adjusted EBITDA margins around 37.5% today (this implies non-U.S. Hotel margins are in the low 20s today).I allocate 60% of D&A and stock-based compensation to U.S. Hotel, incorporate a healthy 38% U.S. tax rate, and apply a 2.0%-3.0% NOPAT yield to reach a $3.4 billion - $5.8 billion valuation. That equates to 4.9x - 7.7x revenue. Several online travel acquisitions have occurred at revenue multiples at this level or higher in recent years, and TripAdvisor is the most valuable asset of them all, in my view.Recall that the U.S. portion of the Hotel business is back to robust double-digit growth, all-time high monetization levels, and just started a $70 million television branding campaign that should only accelerate revenue growth.Final ThoughtsIf the Non-Hotel business is worth $1.9 billion and the U.S. Hotel business is worth at least $3.4 billion, then the non-U.S. Hotel business has a negative value in the market right now. Effectively, not only is that business free but also we are being paid to take it.The truth is the non-U.S. Hotel business has tremendous value. It represents roughly half of Hotel revenue today but its monetization and margins are temporarily depressed due to headwinds from currency, notably in the UK, IB headwinds that it is only now just lapping, and other factors. If this piece is worth even half of the U.S. Hotel business, which itself is valued conservatively here, then TripAdvisor is worth $7.7 billion - $11.3 billion or about $52 - $77 per share today. That is 43% - 110% higher than the current stock quote of $36.49 per share. And of course, that value will grow over time.This is one way of many to illustrate the extent to which TRIP is undervalued today. I do not know when this will correct itself but I'm confident it will do so in spades in the fullness of time.RisksAnother company becomes the go-to site for travel research and erodes TripAdvisor's competitive position.Customer acquisition costs rise faster than user monetization.My valuation assumptions turn out to be too optimistic. That said, given the very large discount at which the stock is trading, I think the risk of losing money permanently is quite remote at this price.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

4058347,99706,2017-03-28T02:41:10-04:00,"Tripadvisor, Inc. investors are starved for some green shoots of good news, as the stock has been nearly halved in the past year under relentless selling pressure.This is usually the time when investors' ears perk up wondering if opportunity knocks. I look at the numbers to see if there is value.Even if there is a bounce off of oversold conditions, TripAdvisor's ability to restore long-term revenue growth and competitive advantage is a coin flip at this point.The company has no upside unless it can reverse declines in its biggest revenue segment, slow down the growth of its expenses, and restore previous levels of revenue and profitability.Takeover speculation is premature at this point.","TripAdvisor, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: TRIP) investors have really taken it on the chin for the past year. Once a high-flying growth stock, the online travel company cannot blame macro factors such as stock market downturns or global economic slowdown for its decline during the past three years. This is a case of falling revenue, earnings misses, and lowered expectations. But is there hope?Still Priced Like The Companies It is UnderperformingLet's get one thing straight right away. TripAdvisor is not ""cheap"" relative to two competitors even now. Just because the stock has fallen 61% since July 2014, 52% since July 2015, and 41% since July 2016, does not mean it has nowhere to go but up. The protracted multi-year decline here can be explained by one word (actually, one acronym): CAGR, or TripAdvisor's lack thereof, compared to its competitors.Even after this massive drop, TripAdvisor is valued similarly to its two largest competitors based on earnings and cash flow multiples. Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN) trades at the most expensive valuation based on free cash flow, and Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE) trades at the most expensive valuation based on P/E. Expedia, however, is unique in that it pays a small dividend of 0.88%. The other two, as of now, require investors to bank simply on future capital gains for their returns:Source: Google FinanceMeanwhile, at least some folks in the world appear not to have got the Airbnb (AIRB) memo yet, because online travel sales are soaring, judging by the returns on these stocks. Expedia is up over 18% in the past 12 months and Priceline is up almost 35%.If you want to play in the growth stock game you have to be putting up at least solid CAGR in revenue, if not in margins, to justify the multiples. TripAdvisor has done exactly the opposite of that, next to its competitors:PCLN Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsYes, revenue is up 56% since 2013, but both competitors have more than doubled theirs over the same time frame. They have also avoided YoY revenue declines, which TripAdvisor just experienced for the first time in 2016. This is a big cause of its stock performance woes, which I will explain in more detail in a moment.TripAdvisor's margins have also fallen off a cliff over the same time frame:PCLN Profit Margin data by YChartsIt appears that margins may have come under recent pressure in the industry, but Priceline is still able to maintain healthy double-digit gross margins even after the decline. This is likely due to its scale. These charts don't include TripAdvisor's latest Q4 numbers, in which gross margin clocked in at only 3.2% and revenue at $316M, trending to ~$1.2B per annum. Both these numbers are considerably lower than those on the chart, so things are not good.Comparison IssuesOf course, the above comparison assumes that we are comparing apples to apples, which we are not. Priceline and Expedia are very similar companies in that they are Online Travel Agents (OTAs). They function with a toll-booth revenue system which allows them to take a cut from every travel reservation that goes through their portal. Priceline has been around since the late-1990s and Expedia has acted as a consolidator in the industry over the last several years, scooping up smaller companies similar to it like Travelocity and Orbitz to become Priceline's only real serious competitor. TripAdvisor, meanwhile, describes itself like this:Expedia and Priceline's missions are clear. They are OTAs. They connect you to the flights, hotels, packages, or whatever you need, so you can book your vacation. TripAdvisor is a review site that wants to help you ""plan"" your trip and ""also"" offer you the ability to book it. It may be the ""world's largest online travel platform,"" but it has existed primarily for customers to gather and compare information and write reviews. What's ironic is the company probably realized that existing revenue sources were going to be pressured because it has shifted its focus to ""instant booking"" belatedly to try and compete with Priceline and Expedia. Yet this has had the perverse effect, according to the 10-k. The meta-search function in the click-through segment generated more revenue before than the instant booking function does now. The company made more aggregating providers than providing the booking platform itself.Sustaining the valuationThe real issue for TripAdvisor is how it expects to maintain this valuation going forward. To start building an analysis of how it might do that, we must obtain the best information we can about the current composition of revenue.From the 10-K we can see that Hotel-based revenue currently accounts for $1.19B of sales or 80% of all revenues:Source: 2016 10-KTripAdvisor is also helpful to investors in breaking down the revenue sources and their progression over the last three fiscal years within this main Hotel revenue segment: Source: 2016 10-KRevenue overall has slightly declined, but all segments are still growing, except the main source of revenue, click-based and transaction. This area is down 13% YoY. The non-hotel segment has grown at a breakneck pace over the last two years but it hasn't been enough to make up for the decline in click-based and in overall revenues.What Can We Expect Going Forward?I have modeled three scenarios based on the company's numbers and tried to use reasonable growth rate assumptions based on the past three years' results, which I will show first. Green are positive numbers, yellow highlighted areas show trends I want to point out, and the red areas are driving the underperformance in the stock and need the most urgent addressing:Source: all my calculations are from the 2016 10-k for 2014 onward, and Google Finance for the percentage change amounts between 2013 and 2014.The relevant points to create a forecast are as follows. First, the decline in click-based portion hotel revenue. Click-based, the biggest component, has averaged -1% growth over the last two years but fell 13% last year. TripAdvisor's biggest and immediate challenge is to reverse this negative trend at the very least.Next, we have the two other components of Hotel-based revenue, display-based and other revenue. These are still growing, but I will point out that the growth rate for both has slowed considerably between 2014 and 2015.Finally, we have non-hotel based revenue, which is the one segment experiencing fast growth. But while this category more than doubled from 2014 to 2015, it only grew 27% last year. The lone bright spot to be sure, but as it has increased to the point of now making up 20% of total revenue, click-based contribution to total revenue has decreased from 60% to 50%.Coupling the problems is the 45% expansion in SG&A expenses over the same period. This is equally responsible for all the ""red"" areas on the spreadsheet; the EBITDA declines, the cash flow declines, and the pressured margins. The task before TripAdvisor is simple. It must restore at least modest growth to the click-based segment and find a way to get these expenses down. If expenses stay at this level, growth has to be lights-out for the stock to rise meaningfully. This is not an assumption I am comfortable holding.ValuationValuing TripAdvisor with a discounted cash flow model is relatively straightforward because the company only has two aspects that impact its valuation: revenue, which we now know how to break down, and expenses. The company does not report any R&D; it classifies all of its expenses under SG&A and usually has had no other items that subtract from its revenue on the income statement other than depreciation. I have also calculated that the two components of net investment (capex-depreciation) have almost cancelled each other out in each of the last three years, averaging about $1m net investment a year. I consider this immaterial for a company TripAdvisor's size. Cost of capital can also be skipped; the company clearly has no need to raise equity with the $250M per annum buyback program that is authorized, and has $91M of long-term debt financed at very attractive rate (2%) on its balance sheet as well as $7M in China at 4.35%. Its current interest expense of $12M, therefore, is also not significant enough in my view to merit being factored into the model.The company has over $700M of cash, mostly outside the US, and reports ~$900M of goodwill and intangibles (the value of the TripAdvisor brand), which are relatively constant amounts over the past three years. Thus, my analysis will focus on the 4 components of revenue and expenses only.I have come up with 3 scenarios.The ""rosy"" scenarioIn its best year (2014), TripAdvisor converted 27% of its revenue into EBITDA. Last year, this figure fell to 11%. My most optimist forecast estimates TripAdvisor getting back to the 25% range by re-establishing 15% growth in its main revenue stream (which will get it back to 2014 levels), maintaining the three other revenue streams roughly at their existing growth rate, and slowing the expenses growth down to 10% per year from the 20%+ growth that has been witnessed over the past two years.How likely is this? Well, everything has to go right. Do you feel like betting on that? Because that's what I would classify this scenario as: a low-probability, speculative bet.Moving on to the""medium term"" scenario:This one is a bit more plausible because +$300M EBITDA could be restored (and the stock might gain back some ground) just by maintaining existing growth rates in the three smaller segments and re-establishing a low single-digit growth rate in the click-based. Again, I have given management the benefit of the doubt on the need to get these expenses under control as they are an equally big part of the problem.The nightmare scenarioHere we see continued deterioration in the click-based segment, growth slowing to 10% in non-hotel revenue, and SG&A maintaining the current trend. Obviously, this one is unlikely, because you have to think management would start paring back the expenses spend if revenue growth really failed to materialize. But as of right now, the CEO guided for possible continued high expenses on the last earnings conference call.""As we move into 2017, we see faster revenue growth ahead. We are considering certain marketing investments to accelerate the user perception shift to TripAdvisor as not only the best review site, but also the best place to compare prices and book.""- CEO Steve Kaufer, February 16, 2017, earnings callManagement has defended the underperformance of the past year by labelling it a ""transition"" year, and while the CEO expects ""faster revenue growth,"" the CFO guided for flat to down EBITDA in 2017 on the same call:""So, the forward-looking statement that we have given about our EBITDA for 2017, flat to down year-on-year incorporates the significant step-up of performance-based marketing. It does not incorporate the brand investment under consideration and that will be separate and then additional as we pointed out in our prepared remarks.""-CFO Ernst J Teunissen, February 16, 2017.It looks like I am factoring in more growth than the leadership of the company is. If management can get the company back to converting 25% of revenue to operating cash flow per my medium-case estimate, and I discount the next three years of cash flows at a 5.2% discount rate (2x the yield on a risk-free investment, 20 year Treasuries (NASDAQ: TLT) then we arrive at $1.16B Net Present Value for the next three years of cash flows, shown below:Add this to around $800M of net liquid assets and management's $1.3B goodwill assumption and you arrive at $3.26B or a $23/share price. But we know that a company with TripAdvisor's revenue and financial health is not going to fall that low without getting acquired.Buyout Rumours - The Hail MaryIn fact, speculation already emerged to that effect at the end of last week, with rumours that Priceline maybe looking to scoop TripAdvisor up. I'm sure that they would love to, but doing so at a price is another matter entirely, so this will probably just stay a rumour, for the time being. And no one knows how or why rumours get started, so let's just look at some facts:-Orbitz was acquired in 2015 by Expedia for $1.35B or ~17x EBITDA.-Although Travelocity was not a public company at the time of Expedia's acquisition, its previous parent, Sabre Corp (NASDAQ: SABR) guided for it to earn $15-20M EBITDA in 2015. Expedia acquired it for $280M in 2015, meaning somewhere between 14x-18x EBITDA. This would be logical, given the terms of Orbitz deal.-As of right now, TripAdvisor trades at about 37x EBITDA. At its peak in 2014, TripAdvisor traded at ~46x EBITDA ($110 price x 142000000 shares/$322M). The stock price being halved can be explained by EBITDA being roughly halved over the same period. And as many investors in stocks that have ended in tears can attest, revenues are a lot easier to grow in the first place than they are to grow back.So if, and this is a big if, TripAdvisor restores ~$300M EBITDA as I have modelled it to (and I have no illusions about that being an easy or linear process), they would not get taken out for the back of the envelope DCF enterprise value of $3.25B but likely for a 17-20x multiple of this EBITDA estimate, meaning $6.8B or 12% above where the stock is now. I think a more likely scenario is for ongoing weakness in the earnings growth and EBITDA and the stock falling further into the low thirties or even the high twenties. We may see the stock get taken out at anywhere from a 25-50% premium from there. Remember, EBITDA is only $166M right now. Multiply that by 20, and you get $3.32B or roughly my DCF enterprise value. Priceline or anybody else big enough to make a move must be aware of the significant risk of overpaying at these current levels.ConclusionTripAdvisor is a great company. It is a busy platform which generates solid operating cash flow, a net profit, and has almost no debt. However, the market has made a painful adjustment to its reduced earning power expectations and there is likely more of that to come, unless management can figure out a way to tamp down expenses and reverse the alarming decline in the Hotel-click through segment. This is the only segment that is not growing but it is the company's biggest by far and left unchecked to decline further alongside the growing expenses, will spell further trouble for the stock valuation. You can put your trust and faith in management to reverse those two trends but you are 1) not getting paid to wait and 2) not being adequately compensated for your risk, unless you want to pay double for what the company itself classifies as goodwill and factor in generous cash flow assumptions that reverse the two trends that have driven down the stock."
4062969,43681,2017-04-19T07:45:40-04:00,"A wide moat business with an excellent brand that is oversold due to transitory headwinds; the downside is mitigated by recent comparable transactions.We estimate that TripAdvisor has been under-monetizing website traffic by a factor of 8-10x based on revenue per hotel shopper at the OTAs.We feel the re-rating of the stock has removed most of the “weak hands,” creating an opportune entry point.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has been presented as a long idea on many platforms over the past two years. Though the stock has not performed to expectations, we believe the core business and brand are still intact and represent an attractive opportunity for patient contrarian investors. Short-term forecasts from the sell-side community have consistently been too high, and management has been too optimistic with regards to the timing of success on its new Instant Booking platform.We feel the re-rating of the stock has removed most of the ""weak hands,"" creating an opportune entry point. While optically the stock is still expensive (26x LTM EV/EBITDA), these metrics are based on a temporarily depressed EBITDA multiple, which we believe should normalize by year-end 2017.Quick Overview of BusinessTripAdvisor is the largest travel research site in the world, aggregating reviews about accommodations, attractions, restaurants, and activities. It also allows the user to book hotels, vacation rentals, flights, activities, restaurants, and attractions. The company has, on average, 390mn monthly unique visitors and sports a number one category ranking in travel/tourism globally. This is, as management describes, the ""top of the funnel"" with regards to mostly unique organic traffic, which TRIP gets mostly for free, and simply redirects or internally tries to monetize.TripAdvisor operates 23 media brands in 48 markets across the globe in 28 languages, and has a highly-engaged user base with over 435 million reviews and opinions. The principal way TripAdvisor earns money is through metasearch (competitive auctions from online travel agencies (OTAs) and hotels) and through enabling users to directly book on the site, which is called Instant Booking.Click-based advertising (including both metasearch & Instant Booking) is by far the biggest driver for TRIP, representing over 63% of revenues for the trailing twelve months. Other ancillary businesses such as subscription/transactions and display-based advertising make up the remaining revenue, with 26% and 11% share respectively.ThesisPlugging the monetization gap is the long-term catalyst where TripAdvisor makes a successful pivot into becoming more transaction-based, similar to traditional OTAs. Historically, TripAdvisor was just a review site that enabled members to get advice on travel and book a hotel through another partner provider (metasearch.) Over time, management realized that most of the traffic never got monetized through TripAdvisor, but rather, through partners.Many times, travelers visited the site just to get what they needed - reviews, pictures, top things to do, etc. - and then booked on their preferred vendor. We estimate that TripAdvisor has been under-monetizing this traffic by a factor of 8-10x based on revenue per hotel shopper at the OTAs. Clearly, if it monetizes just a fraction of this differential, the stock would re-rate significantly higher. This is where TripAdvisor's new product, Instant Booking, comes into play - whereby travelers can now directly book through TRIP without being redirected to another site.While it is easier said than done, with just a few turns of improvement, investors could see a new level of operating margin with tremendous fixed cost leverage utilization - not to mention with repeat transactions, future customer acquisition costs would drop substantially over time, again providing uplift to margins and operating leverage.After the rapid consolidation in the OTA space, TRIP is one of the few remaining large-scale competitors to the Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) duopoly. An interesting dynamic has now unfolded: It appears TripAdvisor is one of the last missing pieces to gaining greater scale and lowering traffic acquisition costs. Additionally, TripAdvisor's entrance into the transactions business puts it directly in the sights of large OTAs that want to protect market share and margins.Furthermore, the company seems to be making inroads against its larger peers by signing the top 9 out of 10 top hotel brands in the world to power TripAdvisor bookings. We believe that as TripAdvisor's Instant Booking product becomes more defined and developed, it could potentially put pressure on both Priceline and Expedia. So, the question becomes: What do Priceline and Expedia end up doing with TripAdvisor now that it's made this pivot?Given Liberty's controlling stake, we think a buyout at these depressed levels is unlikely. However, we do think that recent takeout multiples, at the very least, underpin its current valuation, especially when taking into consideration all the recent acquisitions ($1bn+) by both Priceline and Expedia - most of which were sub-scale businesses, done on average at a TV/EBITDA of approximately 33x.TripAdvisor is currently trading at 26x LTM EV/EBITDA. In our view, this is too cheap considering that TripAdvisor is a premier asset (ranked #1 globally in travel/leisure.) On top of that, we think it is currently under-earning, exacerbating the gap even further. Overall, we believe that the ""top of the funnel"" positioning gives TripAdvisor a competitive advantage over other competitors, further embedding itself into the competitive mix.TripAdvisor's Recent HistoryOver the past few years, TRIP has reconfigured its business model and user experience multiple times; the most pronounced changes have occurred within the past 18 months. The old user experience was essentially a hotel review site with photos and information on location-based activities in combination with an OTA referral site. The main problem with the overall experience was the 5-10 pop-up windows that would fill up the users' screen in a convoluted mess of information.TRIP incorporated this process because each pop-up window generated click-based revenue, albeit annoying users over time. Management eventually realized that this user experience was only beneficial (financially) short term at the expense of long-term customer acquisition. So in early 2013, TRIP began testing out metasearch functionality, which was well behind competitors but finally represented a competitive offering to Kayak, Trivago, and others.This was up until recently when TripAdvisor rolled out a new platform called Instant Booking. The goal in mind was to further improve the user experience and narrow the monetization gap that metasearch had created over the years. Part of the impetus for these changes came from large traffic shifts moving from desktop to mobile, which directly hurt metasearch on mobile. Not only has the company been attempting to make a large product transition, but the overall conversion rates for mobile have been significantly lower than desktop/tablet, thus creating another temporary headwind.Over the years, TripAdvisor has fundamentally altered its business from a review and metasearch site to a site that has an improved user experience incorporating restaurant reviews, experiences, and vacation rental listings - becoming a ""one-stop travel shop."" Many analysts think that TripAdvisor has become ""too many things to too many people.""However, we disagree with that notion, especially when it comes to the traffic trends moving towards mobile. On an app-based system, we think a unified all-in one app presents many benefits for the user. For instance, rather than a mobile user having multiple apps for hotels, experiences, activities, cars, and flights, a TripAdvisor user with the app can seamlessly consolidate all these searches into one platform. We think this combined, unified experience will be highly relevant and compelling for travelers across the globe.A Large and Growing Addressable MarketAlthough there has recently been a slowdown in global travel growth due to terrorism and political instability in Europe, global travel growth in 2016, estimated at 3.3%, is still below long-term growth rates. The long-term outlook from the World Travel & Tourism Council is for the global travel and tourism sector in terms of GDP contribution growing at 4% on average per year for the next decade. While short-term travel and tourism growth can be lumpy due to various exogenous factors, it is predicted to outpace global growth long term.Given TripAdvisor's ""top of the funnel"" structure, we believe that the company is favorably positioned to capitalize on taking global market share as more bookings and ad dollars shift from traditional travel providers to OTAs. This opportunity is compelling because TripAdvisor is ranked as the #1 travel/tourism website globally, while only garnering 0.115% of the global travel market share.Another important factor when considering online travel is how the market has consolidated during the past five years; the small-scale competitors have been swallowed up by larger scaled players (Priceline, Expedia, and Ctrip (CTRP)). The established leaders have built up strong brand loyalty such as Priceline, Expedia, and TripAdvisor, while smaller entrants have had less success in taking market share as the online travel market becomes less fragmented.Top Global Websites, Travel and Tourism category:In 2014, TripAdvisor expanded its addressable market by purchasing Viator for $200mn in cash. We think this was a prescient acquisition, given TripAdvisor is one of the few platforms that could utilize Viator's large international inventory of tours and activities. The non-hotel-related business is helping to bring out more brand awareness to more customers that normally would not be booking through TripAdvisor. We think, long term, this opportunity could be quite fitting, further transforming TripAdvisor into a one-stop global travel shop.Traffic TrendsWe find it useful to look at overall traffic patterns and demographics to gain an understanding of the drivers of the online travel market. We used website analytics company Similarweb and scrubbed social media and app metrics to gather information on the domestic OTA dynamics. Pertaining specifically to TripAdvisor, we found that traffic share is roughly equal across the OTAs. One notable breakdown of TRIP's mobile traffic is that 14% is from tablet traffic, leaving mobile/phone with around one third of total traffic.Looking at some granular details with traffic share reveals some insight into how users arrive at the site. TripAdvisor, by far, has the most amount of organic search traffic at approximately 67%, with direct and organic representing over 85% of total traffic. While there is a heavy reliance on Google, which is somewhat of a risk long term, overall traffic costs at TripAdvisor is a fraction of the remaining group.As the pie chart shows below, organic traffic represents almost 94% of the total traffic to TripAdvisor, with paid traffic representing only 6%. On average, the remaining comparables have 4x the amount of paid traffic hitting their respective sites.Mobile, and specifically apps, are what we believe will be key for the OTA industry in the future as it works through shifting consumer preferences from desktop to mobile. With that being said, the Android operating system representing 86.2% of global smart phone market share (Gartner) was a key area of focus for us. Based on the limited data Google provides, we can ascertain roughly what other popular travel apps have, as far as installed user bases.The most popular global travel apps we found, besides TripAdvisor, were Booking.com (Priceline), Kayak (Priceline), Expedia, Trivago (Expedia) and Airbnb (AIRB) - each with an installed user base ranging from 10-50mn. If we assume on average the installed user base represents the midpoint at 30mn and adjust the figure for the number of apps downloaded from Apple's app store, based on Gartner's market share data, we can back into a rough estimate of 35mn total installed apps.TripAdvisor discloses in its log files from Q3 2016 that its app has been downloaded over 370mn times! This simple math would imply that TripAdvisor should have over 10x the installed user base of any one individual app. What is so compelling about this is the massive installed user base is on one unified TripAdvisor app platform versus the others fragmented among different brands.Narrowing the Monetization GapTripAdvisor has lagged significantly during the past 5 years, underperforming both against the averages as well as compared to peers Expedia and Priceline by a wide margin. Part of the reason for this underperformance is due to the large investments needed to make the necessary monetization pivot; so while revenues have growth quite substantially, operating profit growth has been masked by costs.For instance, for the most recent nine months, total selling and marketing expenses were up over 7% and personnel and overhead expenses up 16%. We view the lion's share of the margin compression as transitory rather than a permanent normalized level.Though the margin trends are worrying, upon closer look, we feel there are several factors that explain most of the compression. One factor is the long-term trend closely reflects the margin trend at Expedia as the large OTAs rush to gain market share and grow topline at the sacrifice of profitability. While most of the recent margin pressure can be attributed to Priceline's exclusive deal with TripAdvisor, that has recently ended with Expedia joining the TripAdvisor platform.Other short-term promotions and incentives include giving away Amazon gift cards for new customers who try Instant Booking as well as prize giveaways for first time bookings on TripAdvisor. The goal of these promotions is to generate repeat purchasing behavior where customers ""vault"" (store) their credit cards, thereby making repeat purchasing behavior easier. Lastly, the traffic mix shift has been trending from desktop/tablet to mobile, where mobile monetizes at roughly 30% of desktop.While overall conversion/monetization is improving on its mobile app, it is still a significant headwind for TripAdvisor to where historically desktop traffic monetized. We think over time the trends in mobile conversion will improve to similar levels on desktop as users become more aware and familiar with Instant Booking. This has been well televised from management but continues to pressure margins and topline growth.All these factors combined obfuscate the normalized earnings level for TripAdvisor, and we think this has masked the ""true earnings"" power of the business. Going into 2017, the full global rollout of Instant Booking will be lapped, which should help comps, especially notable towards the end of 2017. We estimate the full ""lap"" should occur in Q2/Q3 2017, given the full global roll out of Instant Booking was complete in the beginning of Q2 '16.Downside Risk Underpinned by Take-Out MultiplesWhile our thesis does not rest solely upon a buyout, we do think comparable transactions give some insight into valuation. Since TripAdvisor has a top ranking in the travel and tourism category, we think that a takeout multiple should be at the higher end of recent deals.For illustrative purposes, we will use the average, which is brought down substantially due to Orbitz, a sub-scale online travel provider. If you go off a 33x multiple, which we think is far too low given the growth prospects, it puts the valuation somewhere just under $60. Though this is far from an exact science, we think it does give some credence to the current discounted valuation.Over the course of 2016, Priceline has been rumored to be interested in acquiring TripAdvisor on multiple occasions, and we think it makes operational sense given that Priceline is heavily integrated within TripAdvisor. Priceline not only has metasearch exposure with TRIP, but has fully integrated Instant Booking through Booking.com and other Priceline domains. Finally, we noticed another relationship with Priceline through its Opentable integration, where a restaurant that is not listed under TheFork.com/Lafourchette (TripAdvisor owned company), often is linked to the Opentable platform.Opentable has had success in certain key markets, but has had a hard time gaining share throughout Europe in areas where Lafourchette/TheFork.com is popular. If TRIP were to be acquired, Lafourchette/TheFork.com would fit nicely into adjacent markets that Opentable has had trouble penetrating. Not only would there be operational synergies, but Priceline would stand to benefit greatly from acquiring the 390mn monthly average unique visitors.RisksSummaryAt $41 per share, we think TripAdvisor represents a compelling opportunity to buy an asset-light business with a top global brand presence that should compound capital at high levels for the foreseeable future. TripAdvisor's multi-phased rollout of Instant Booking has not been as smooth as management had anticipated, but we think brand value is still intact with long-term secular growth tailwinds ahead of it. While TripAdvisor may not entirely narrow the monetization gap with Priceline and Expedia, if it gets just a fraction of the differential, its stock could be worth many multiples of its current valuation.Disclaimer: This report is intended for informational purposes only and you, the reader, should not make any financial, investment, or trading decisions based upon the author's commentary.

4079066,21815,2017-06-06T06:33:19-04:00,"TripAdvisor has a unique online travel presence, by far the biggest in the world.The main problem is the shift from an ad based revenue model to a transaction based model, requiring substantial investments that have not yet paid off.But at a minimum, the required investments should decline.And the company is financially healthy and profitable and the platform itself is unique, if the company cannot improve its monetization, someone else will.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is the premier travel site in terms of visitors. However, the problem is that it's not as good in monetizing all that traffic compared to other online travel agencies (Priceline, Expedia, etc.).There is, or perhaps was, a simple reason for that, TripAdvisor started off as a travel review site, accumulating member provided reviews of hotels, restaurants, attractions, and what not. It generated income through click-based advertising.It has embarked on increasing the monetization of its existing visitor base by offering booking possibilities through its Instant Bookings Platform. Here is the basic idea (from Tnooz):This has been off to a slow start and they have experimented with different layouts and models, and all these changes required substantial investments depressing margins and, as a result, the stock price:This isn't terribly surprising, while revenue kept on increasingThis increase pales with respect to the big OTAs (Priceline and Expedia). What's more, earnings per share have taken quite a hit:Another negative for the company was a shift to mobile, were conversion rates are substantially below PCs and tablets.But not all is necessarily lost. The platform is starting to gain traction, as it's Instant Bookings Platform gained deals with hotel giant Starwood and Marriott Hotels (NASDAQ:MAR) and they now have 9 out of the top 10 hotel chains (including, Accor, Best Western International, Carlson Rezidor, Choice Hotels, Hyatt Hotels, Langham Hospitality, La Quinta Inns & Suites, Mandarin Oriental, and Wyndham Worldwide). The company bought Viator, adding tours and activities. They also integrated with Uber.More significant are the deals with the tw OTA giants Priceline's (PCLN) Bookings.com and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) joining the Instant Bookings Platform. This is quite remarkable, as Expedia has a TripAdvisor competitor in Trivago (NASDAQ:TRVG). In fact, Expedia is pretty deeply integrated with TripAdvisor.The PlatformWe would argue this is unique online travel real estate:Another possible catalyst could be a take-over. The big two OTA are better at monetizing, but the large presence and low acquisition cost that TripAdvisor enjoys are likely to be looked at with some envy. There has already been a considerable amount of speculation about this, and it's not a given, but there is a good deal of logic behind this thinking.There are some tentative signs of improvement though:Resulting in a slight improvement of EBITDA margins in the hotel sector, from 26% in Q4 2016 to 28% in Q1 2017.ValuationYou see that TripAdvisor is valued considerably less compared to the industry, and given the negative EPS growth in the recent past, this isn't surprising. However, the market seems to assume that this negative earnings growth will endure.But with the investments in the Instant Bookings Platform largely behind us and the mobile presence cleaned up, we see no reasons why the company shouldn't be able to monetize this platform better, given its large amount of online visitors and users of its app.Now that there is an attractive one-stop shop platform in place, one might wonder why not more visitors and users looking for reviews of hotels and accommodations would actually start to book on the platform as well, rather than go to another site to book. It's probably habit, and habits have a way of dying slowly but even a small shift would already make a material impact, given the large amount of visitors the site generates.Each factor alone would already help considerably, but lower investments and better monetization could produce a pretty powerful boost to earnings, as it happens. Mix in take-over speculation and the shares could start to shine again.RisksIn setting out the risks, the article by SA contributor MoneyBear Research is very helpful. It argues that:Indeed, there is no escape of that, especially given that its valuation isn't significantly below these competitors. While we see some room for improvement, MoneyBear is much more pessimistic about that.He seems to assume that the decline in click-based revenue, the biggest component (of both the hotel and the far smaller non-hotel sector) keeps on declining (it declined 13% in 2016) and the two other categories of hotel income, display-based and other revenue have kept on growing but at declining rates. Even the explosive growth in the non-hotel category is slowing.Add to that the 45% of cost increase over the last three years, and you get a pretty negative picture.ConclusionSA contributor MoneyBear Research is right in pointing out stagnation and cost increases. While there are reasons to assume TripAdvisor might be able to monetize more of its visitors with the help of the Instant Bookings Platform, this still remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the decline in click-based advertising income proceeds.On the other hand, there are reasons for optimism. The Instant Bookings Platform is now rolled out and the heavy investments will subside to a considerable degree. What's more, there isn't a whole lot of users and visitors, of which TripAdvisor has plenty, needed to start using the platform for bookings to make a material difference.On top of that, the company still generates sufficient amounts of cash, has a healthy balance sheet, and is a potentially attractive take-over candidate.While there isn't sufficient hard evidence to conclude that TripAdvisor's Instant Bookings Platform making up for the lower revenue elsewhere, even if it has amassed a great deal of partners.However we think nevertheless that taking a small speculative position on the basis of this possibility could pay off big, whilst the downside risks, while certainly not absent, should be limited at least to a certain extent by the increasing possibility that the company will be taken over if the shares keep on falling. It's an undeniably good fit for the top two OTAs.So it's basically a risk/reward bet. People who prefer their investments to be on more solid ground should wait for more hard evidence the new TripAdvisor is turning around.One could basically argue that it is a potentially very valuable platform, but one which hasn't yet found the ideal way to monetize. We know quite a few of these, yet at least TripAdvisor is financially sound."

The stock price has been down 18%, and forward EPS and price targets are also revised down. Many difficulties facing the company, such as slow shopper growth, monetization challenges with mobile and IB and rich valuation, have been discussed in my initiation article and the last quarter's update. As my theses are realized, I would advise to be even more cautious going forward. I believe that in the short to even medium term, the stock will be trading range-bound. The issues highlighted this quarter are persisting problems, and the management has not shown signs that they can tackle them effectively. Until the challenges outlined in ""The Bad News"" section below are resolved, a ceiling will cap the stock price. Similarly, I believe IB is the right strategy for the company in the long term as it can help Tripadvisor to close the monetization gap compared to competitors. In addition, hopes for a turnaround and/or M&A will maintain a floor for the price. Further pockets of optimism are discussed in ""The Good News.""The Bad NewsMy previous bearishness on the stock centers on the following: 1) user growth slows; 2) commission charged compressed with IB and mobile; and 3) Growth IB brings is too optimistic. These themes undeniably played out in Q3 and will continue to pressure the stock in the following few quarters. Recall that TRIP aggressively rolled out IB worldwide in Q1 and Q2. As resources were taken away and spending in paid marketing channels was limited, traffic growth slowed to low single digits. Given that this past quarter marked the one-year anniversary of IB roll-out in US (Aug.) and UK (Sept.), we would expect to see hotel shopper growth ramp up significantly. However, hotel shopper growth is up only 3.4% in Q3 vs. 3% in Q2. Several major causes to such phenomenon include fierce competition, slow macro environment and smaller marketing spending. Management pledged to spend more on marketing in 2017, with the possibility to re-ramp TV spend to drive broader IB adoption. This will likely pressure margin, with uncertain effect on revenue growth.Furthermore, growth momentum, mostly contributed from IB, will likely slow going forward. Much of the previous hype has been a result of aggressively adding supply to the platform. In previous articles, I have outlined that due to the construct of the hotel business, room for incremental supply growth is small. Being caught between limited supply and demand growth, TRIP could be in trouble.Perhaps the biggest concern lies in mobile. TRIP's traffic was about 50% from desktop, 10% on tablets and 40% on smartphones. Of mobile traffic, about 50% was from the TRIP app and 50% from the mobile web. App traffic grew 50% y/y, off a small base. In previous quarters, management accounted that mobile monetization is 30% of desktop. With the same 30% mobile monetization rate, which the management confirmed, I estimated that revenue from desktop hotel shoppers is down 18%, not a good forward-looking indicator given that desktop still comprises ~80% of total revenues and mobile monetization remains at the same low point for quarters.The Good NewsDespite challenges, the road ahead for TRIP is not all dreary. I do think that in the long term, IB is the right strategy for the firm to differentiate itself from peers and grow the business. As management noted in the recent Phocuswright conference this month, TRIP wants to be something for all people, compared to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as a media site and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) as a transaction site. Even with IB, management emphasized that traditional OTA transactions will continue to exist on the platform to cater customers who wants to find the best results.Furthermore, IB offers incredible amount of convenience. Customers' credit cards are stored on the site so that they can come back and book something. Of TRIP's mobile app traffic (ie. 25% of total TRIP traffic), 20% of users rebook using a stored credit card (ie. 5% of total TRIP traffic). IB therefore allows TRIP to collect even more data which could potentially be powerful for the business. At the conference, TRIP subtly entertained the idea of doing more with their data, including the use of machine learning techniques. Adam Medros, SVP of Global Products, gave one example:""We are already taking all of that content, that corpus of content that we have, and distilling out of it interesting bits about for example, for a restaurant, the dishes that are being served there, and mapping that to sort of common names for dishes, and being able to tell people when they walk in the restaurant -- people talk about X, or Y, or Z.""Needless to say, the success of IB is contingent on customers seeing its added value. The management is currently working on enhancing the user experience and will then put more effort on customer education, getting them to think about TRIP more as a booking site as opposed to just planning and researching. In more mature markets such as the US, revenue from IB desktop is already at parity with metasearch as conversions improve. According to the management, macro trends also appeared more favorable in September and continued in October. Therefore, investors may see positive surprises ahead.Conclusion: Looking at both the negative and positive sides, I believe that in the short term, negative outcomes will continue to dominate. User growth, mobile monetization and brand image transformations are all difficult tasks to tackle. As rosy as the positive sides may seem, management does not seem to have a clear plan to deliver them. They also conceded that the IB transition has been longer and more painful than they have envisioned. I foresee the stock price trading range-bound in the near term."
4021435,22148,2016-11-09T05:46:13-05:00,TripAdvisor reported highly disappointing Q3 revenue numbers.The company is struggling to monetize the growing user base and content due in part to a late shift to mobile.The valuation remains questionable for a company lacking growth.,"Considering the growth of online travel site The Priceline Group (PCLN), one might expect good quarterly numbers from TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). Unfortunately though, the travel review site has been on a bad trip for shareholders over a couple of years now.The stock peaked above $110 all the way back in 2014. At the after-hours price down some 50% from those highs, the market will probably still question the value.The main issue is that TripAdvisor is not ahead of the game on monetization and the shift to mobile. One of the reasons that TripAdvisor garnered a valuation around $10 billion was how the travel segment monetized so well online early. The travel review site spent a good part of the Q3 results still discussing a need to lower monetization in order to encourage the habit of booking on mobile.TripAdvisor remains a content machine with 50% growth in user reviews and opinions. Even average monthly unique visitors were up 11% over last year.The monetization though is substantially lower as revenues are basically flat. At the same time, TripAdvisor has 400 more employees over last year to reach 3,400.The global scale might be impressive, but the company has struggled for a couple of years to turn that into profitable growth. In fact, adjusted EBITDA peaked back in 2014 along with the stock price.This all brings us to the valuation issue with TripAdvisor. In comparison to the other consumer review site, Yelp (NYSE:YELP), TripAdvisor is crazy expensive. Especially considering that Yelp is growing at a faster clip.TRIP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe growth in consumer reviews and platform engagement is what makes the story appealing if the stock valuation were appealing. The ability to monetize that content is a fluid situation that TripAdvisor could eventually solve. Even at the after-hours drop, TripAdvisor doesn't offer much of a bargain in comparison to the growth rate.The key investor takeaway is that a stock trading down to new multi-year lows and reporting disappointing numbers is one to continue avoiding. The user engagement numbers are a reason to keep lurking around the stock, but investors should wait for a better entry point and some positive signs on monetization before getting serious about TripAdvisor."
4012601,99986,2016-10-17T14:36:51-04:00,"Despite the S&P-500 being up over 5% for the year, TripAdvisor's shares are down over 28%.While the company continues to report annual revenue growth, their earnings continue to slide.The stock remains in a pronounced downtrend on the daily and weekly charts.","In March of 2014 the S&P-500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) stood at 1800 and few questioned the validity of the bull market. At the same time, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) was trading at $108.00, and had seen a 350% run since its IPO in 2012. TripAdvisor was seen as a must own stock which had significantly outperformed the market, and was even compared to Priceline (PCLN) by one writer. Since March of 2014, Priceline and TripAdvisor have clearly diverged. While Priceline has seen a 5% increase in its share price, from $1360 to $1,430, TripAdvisor has seen a 43% decline. The stock has fallen from $108.06 to $61.31, and has been nearly halved. The below chart shows this very clearly, while both stocks rallied strongly before topping in 2012, Priceline has traded in a range up until this year while TripAdvisor has slipped into a clear downtrend. Unfortunately for TripAdvisor investors, the stock has become a consistent under-performer when compared to the market, with no bottom in sight. Despite the company reporting year over year revenue growth, their annual earnings continue to flounder. This can be attributed to expenses that continue to climb which are overshadowing their slight revenue beats. Despite revenue growing at roughly 20% a year, sales and general and administrative expenses are growing at over 40% annually. I believe the worst is yet to come for TripAdvisor, and recommend shorting the stock at current levels.Source: TC2000.comSource: TC2000.comHow I scan for short opportunitiesMy investing strategy is a trend-following approach, and my buy signals are generated when stocks make new 3-month highs while above their 200-day moving average. My criteria for short candidates is based on very similar methodology, but I am looking for the exact opposite. My short signals are generated when a stock makes new 20-day lows, underneath a declining 200-day moving average. The reason I place so much importance on the 200-day moving average is very simple. The 200-day moving average is my line in the sand to determine whether an asset is in a bull or bear market. If a stock is above a rising 200-day moving average and making new highs, there is no question in my mind it's in a bull market. If a stock is below a declining 200-day moving average and making new lows, the stock is in a bear market.In addition to the above criteria for short candidates, there is one thing I am looking for. When looking for stocks to short, I want to scan for stocks that are in clear downtrends on their weekly chart. The last thing I want to do is short a stock that is breaking down within a longer term uptrend. This type of setup is a recipe for disaster, as there is a possibility you are shorting at support within the uptrend.To supplement my technical buy and short signals, I use fundamental analysis to confirm my trade thesis. When looking for new positions to enter, I am looking for stocks that have both quarterly and annual earnings growth. Despite the stocks giving me a technical buy signal, it must also give me a confirmation based on my fundamental screening. When looking for short candidates, I do not want to be shorting stocks with annual earnings growth. I prefer to be short stocks with either declining annual earnings, or annual earnings that are tapering off.Now that I have explained my methodology for screening new positions, we will look at how TripAdvisor stacks up.Fundamental ScreeningTaking a look at TripAdvisor from an annual earnings growth standpoint, the results are not all that encouraging. The stock reported diluted earnings per share of $1.04 in 2010, and saw that climb to a high of $1.55 in 2014. After reporting record 2014 earnings of $1.55 per share, the company saw it drop to $1.36 last year. There is no question that the company's earnings growth is sputtering, as it moves from 26% year over year growth in 2011, to -12% growth last year. Even more discouraging is the earnings reported by the company thus far this year. The company reported diluted EPS of $0.18 in Q1, and diluted EPS of $0.23 in Q2. The company's semi annual diluted EPS of $0.41 pales in comparison to the $0.83 over the same period last year.Despite TripAdvisor seeing increasing revenue year over year, it is costing them more in expenses to generate this added revenue. While revenue grew by nearly 20% last year, sales and general and administrative expenses grew by over 37%. In addition to this, research and development expenses saw an increase of over 20% on the year. The expenses undertaken by the company to generate this annual revenue growth is not the company's bottom line at all. I believe this trend to continue, and get worse over the coming quarters. TripAdvisor is seeing increasing competition from companies like Airbnb, and many other small travel sites. Competition should only get stiffer in the future and further erode TripAdvisor's earnings per share.Source: YCharts.comSource: YCharts.comBased on the current outlook, I would be surprised to see company reach the $1.10 mark this year for diluted EPS. This would result in another decline in annual earnings growth, and nearly double the percentage decline from last year. Even if TripAdvisor manages to finish the year with $1.10 a share in earnings, this would equate to a 20% drop from their 2015 earnings. TripAdvisor passes my fundamental test for companies I am looking to short. The company is seeing quarterly year over year declines in earnings, as well as annual declines year over year. It is clear that the company's earnings peaked in 2014, and I do not think the company will see earnings above $1.50 a share again any time soon.Technical ScreeningFrom a technical standpoint, TripAdvisor is looking just as bleak. The stock has been locked in a pronounced downtrend for nearly 2 years, and continues to make lower highs and lower lows. The 40% rally off the lows in 2015 ran right into the brick wall of downtrend resistance, resulting in another lower high for the stock. Despite the S&P-500 and Nasdaq (NASDAQ:QQQ) making new all-time highs this year, TripAdvisor has not participated. The stock has seen a barrage of selling and I don't expect sellers will let up until the stock reaches much lower levels.Source: TC2000.comTaking a look at the weekly chart, we can see the clear downtrend mentioned above. The downtrend line currently comes in around the $71.00 level and should be strong resistance for the stock on any rallies. The 40-week moving average which acted as support for the stock during its 2012-2014 bull market, now acts as strong resistance. Every rally to this level has been a false breakout, and the stock quickly falls back beneath it.Moving down to the daily chart, it is easier to see the short signal based on my trend-following system. The short signal was given on August 4th of this year after the company reported earnings. The stock dropped 8.5% to new 20-day lows. I did not take the short setup on this day, as I do not like shorting after gap downs of more than 5%. The risk-reward ratio is not the greatest therefore I decided to wait for a better entry. As of Friday of last week, I got the setup I was looking for. The stock has been trading sideways since its gap down in August and momentum is now back to the downside, after a brief failure at the 200-day moving average. In addition to momentum turning back to the downside, the support below at the $59.84 level is wearing thin. The more times a support or resistance line gets tested, the more likely it is to be broken through. The stock has now tested its support level 9 times in 2016, and I would be amazed if the next test holds. I expect the stock to violate this level by earnings, and it's possible the catalyst to break support is another miss by the company.Source: TC2000.comWhat if my thesis is wrong?No matter what type of position I am entering, I always figure out where my max pain level is before entering. I am short TripAdvisor as of Friday from$61.86, and my stop level on this trade is at $71.87 on a closing basis. My stops for trend-following trades are based on levels where I believe my thesis to be invalidated. I have chosen the $71.87 level for 3 different reasons:A) The $71.87 level represents a break of the 200-day moving average to the upside, which begins to jeopardize my bear market thesis on the stock.B) The $71.87 level represents a clean break of the downtrend in place since 2016, I do not want to be short during a breakout from a prolonged downtrend.C) The $71.87 level also represents new a new high above the June and July highs of this year. This would mark a new 3-month high above the stock's 200-day moving average, and on a technical basis would be a long entry for me. I have no interest in being short a stock that is generating a technical long entry. Due to the fact the company does not meet my fundamental criteria, I would exit my short position, and would not go long the stock above $72.00.If the downtrend line breaks and the 200-day moving average is regained, my final line in the sand is the past resistance of this year. I believe if all of these 3 levels are overcome, there is a very weak technical thesis for being short the stock.What is my risk?My risk on this trade is the difference between my entry at $61.86, and my stop at $71.87. This represents a $10.01 risk on my position, or roughly 16%. Due to the fact that there is a 16% position risk, I am only using 6% of my portfolio to short the stock. My risk profile only allows me to risk between 1.0 - 1.25% of my portfolio at the most on any one position. A 6% position in my portfolio with a 16% risk is equal to a total portfolio risk of 0.96%. I have no price target on this trade as I believe price targets are profit-limiting. As long as the stock remains under the 200-day moving average I will stay short the stock. If the stock's decline becomes too steep, I will take profits on 1/3 of my position to re-balance the sizing in my portfolio, and remain short with the remaining 2/3 position.Due to the fact I am 100% long the market in my ETF account using UPRO, I am running a balanced portfolio in my U.S. equities account. I am currently long Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Fresh Del Monte Produce (NYSE:FDP), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) with 50% of my portfolio. I am currently short Whole Foods Market (WFM), FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), and Seabridge Gold (NYSE:SA) with 20% of my portfolio. As should be quite evident, I am long some of the strongest stocks, and short the weakest stocks. This position moves the balance of my U.S. equity account to 50% long, and 28% short. If I am wrong on the direction of the S&P-500, the stocks I am short should see significant declines and off-set most of the declines in my long positions. I am currently long the S&P-500 from 2045 in April from this article where I stated we were going to new all-time highs. My stop on this trade is a close below 2035 on a closing basis, a risk of 0.5% on the trade from my entry.I believe TripAdvisor to be an excellent short candidate for those looking for protection against their longs in this market. I see no reason to believe the stock's trend will reverse, and the support below is looking more fragile each month. The fact that the company pays no dividend means that there is no cost for shorting the shares, which is another positive. The trend is not your friend if you are a long in TripAdvisor, and I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel for TripAdvisor investors at this time."
4003657,96196,2016-09-01T14:50:41-04:00,Unique visitor metrics are slowing.Expenses are still rising while revenues are declining.Mgmt evaded top-line forecasting questions.,"TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) reported earnings early last month, and the key points are as follows:Revenue Per Hotel Shopper fell 19% which led the decline in Hotel Revenue. Two other important metrics are worth noting:Revenues per hotel shopper continues to decline as Expedia's 'Revenue Per Room Night' is also declining at a slightly slower pace. Expedia's Revenue per room night growth for Q2 and FY 2015 netting out the eLong acquisition was -5% and -14%. Since TripAdvisor derives a significant portion of revenues from Expedia, this decline is passed down to Trip.According to TripAdvisor's management team:The points made in the above statement are moot because these issues preceded Brexit and the European terrorist attacks - Priceline also had a fantastic quarter. The growing 'Non-hotel' segment is basically a roll-up of acquisitions the company made over the past few years. The acquisitions have no competitive advantages and they are diving head-first into saturated markets with inevitable razor-thin margins. One example is Viator which offers tours and activities using the Groupon business model of selling coupons for activities. The segment is burning cash and destroying value while Trip's core business continues to struggle.Management also evaded a question about FY 17 revenues as they did with FY 16 when they said they would no longer give guidance conveniently right before the top-line issues came to light. The question came from Robert Peck of SunTrust:Ernst, Trip's CFO answered:Instant Booking is out, there are no more excuses. At 61x earnings, expenses growing faster than revenues, and revenues actually declining, 50% downside is a fairly conservative forecast. 2017 should prove to be a pivotal year for the company. I'm looking to refinance the puts through 2019, so whenever the Jan '19 puts become available, I'll buy more. If I do get the portfolio cash down to the 20-25% range before that period, then I'll most likely just add more Jan 18's $40 puts."
4042091,69905,2017-02-02T14:50:06-05:00,TripAdvisor has a rock solid financial position that the market is forgetting.TripAdvisor has fantastic pricing power.TripAdvisor is growing its non-hotel revenue very aggressively.,"Investment ThesisInvestors are overly pessimist when it comes to TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). And while the market is mostly right regarding TRIP's slowdown in revenue, it is already more than factored in at the current share price.In the past 5 years, TRIP has been growing its revenues at a huge clip. It has also successfully positioned itself as an online travel leader and is actively working on diversifying its revenue stream. In time, the market will remember this and close the discount from intrinsic value that I conservatively estimate to be at least 20%, if not significantly more.TRIP data by YChartsBusiness OverviewTRIP owns and operates a portfolio of leading online travel brands. It helps people plan and book trips online and has more than 430m reviews across its websites and roughly 390m monthly unique users. TRIP also enables users to compare real-time pricing so that they can book hotels, vacation rentals, flights, and attractions.Although revenue is down -6% YoY, as of last quarter (2016 Q3), it has in fact improved very slightly sequentially and is up 1%. However, I feel investors are putting too much weight on the company's temporary slowdown and missing another interesting aspect of growth opportunity that the company is working on.Non-Hotel RevenueAs you can see in the table below, not only has TRIP managed to diversify from its hotel-only revenue, but this other revenue stream is actually growing very fast.Source: 2016 Q3 Investor PresentationTRIP includes attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals under this non-hotel segment. This segment makes up a punchy 24% of total revenue. Having a more diversified revenue stream offers management additional levers to pull that will result in a smoother EPS line and cause the stock to trade at a higher multiple. Because, if there is one thing that investors look for in a growing company, it is a smooth bottom line which the market usually rewards with a higher multiple.Furthermore, it is not only a diversification play, but TRIP believes that this non-hotel segment could, in time, reach $1B in revenue. This is an opportunity that is currently being disregarded by the market.FinancialsThe table below shows that the company is growing quite fast, at over 25% CAGR over the past 5 years. Obviously, it is unrealistic for it to continue at this growth rate, but to make it a good investment at the current market price, TRIP does not need to grow at even half of this rate.Source: morningstar.com; author's calculationsA good quality business has free cash flow (""FCF"") margins above 5%, and TRIP has normalized FCF% of 25%, which is absolutely fantastic, especially when we consider it is still in a tough cyclical industry. This is echoed in TRIP having a normalized ROE of 21%, which for a practically unlevered company, is super. Furthermore, the high FCF% proves that, in spite of the illusion that this type of business has low barriers to entry, competition has yet to become a serious concern.Short SellersAs far as large caps go, TRIP is quite heavily shorted (~11%). In the event that my thesis plays out even half as well as I describe here, the short sellers will be forced to cover their positions at higher prices, offering another boost to the share price.Relative ValuationIn order to confirm that investors are not overpaying by investing in TRIP, I looked to a relative valuation and a DCF valuation. First, from the relative perspective, then a DCF valuation.Source: Morningstar.comFrom the relative valuation perspective. My favorite metric is the P/S ratio. I like it because it is quite a clean metric. I like to compare what investors have been willing to pay for a stock over the past five years and what they are willing to pay for it now. In the past five years, investors were happy to pay 9.2x P/S. Currently, investors are only asked to pay only 5.3x P/S. This discrepancy represents a 20% upside.DCF ValuationI confirmed the margin of safety when I performed a back-of-the-envelope DCF analysis with a normalized $260M of FCF, with 10% growth over the next five years. (Although the company has grown at a CAGR of 25% over the past 5 years, no one can realistically expect these rates to persist, but at less than half that over the next 5 years, I suspect this is very much achievable).I then discounted this FCF back at 10%. I used 10% because the company is still a young enterprise and has a significant amount of uncertainty facing its future prospects, including the possibility of its competitors eating away at its margins. This brings the DCF to roughly $9.1B market cap or at 15%-20% upside to the current share price.CompetitionTRIP does trade cheaply for a highly followed growth company. And when I compare TRIP to one of its peers, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), it reinforces that TRIP is trading at a discount.On a P/S ratio basis, EXPE is very close to fair value when compared to its 5-year average. This shows that there is investor appetite for travel companies.ConclusionAs far as highly followed large caps go, TRIP is quite satisfactorily priced with a margin of safety of at least 20%. Obviously, the whole analysis is reliant on TRIP being able to defend its margins against competitors and it achieving the small amount of growth being built into my target price. Additionally, while the travel industry is notoriously cyclical, investors should not forget that TRIP has done a fantastic job of growing its revenue while keeping its balance sheet virtually debt-free.Investors seeking a different opportunity could do well to consider this company selling cheaply.Thank you so much for reading my article.

4028357,101969,2016-12-07T05:00:00-05:00,"At $46 per share, TRIP's core Hotel business ""stub"" is trading for $4.6 billion at most.$4.6 billion is 3.8x Hotel revenue, 14.1x Hotel EBITDA (counting stock comp as a real expense), and a 4.3% Hotel NOPAT yield. This is the cheapest TRIP has ever been.The sell-side apparently thinks Trivago, a vastly inferior business, is worth $4-$5 billion. Whatever Trivago is worth, TripAdvisor is worth far more.Tax-loss selling is weighing on TRIP, but will abate in January. Expedia joining Instant Booking should improve monetization in 2017. TRIP worth $100+ and more given the fullness of time.","I study great businesses with high returns on capital, long growth runways, and enduring competitive advantages, and then I wait for them to become cheap and unpopular. TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP) at $46 per share represents exactly that.I don't usually do this, but I'm going to start with TripAdvisor's current valuation.ValuationTripAdvisor reports its financial results in two segments. First, I'll value the Non-Hotel segment, which includes its attractions (Viator), restaurants (TheFork), and vacation rentals businesses. Attractions, in particular, is growing rapidly, has an estimated $1.3 billion global addressable market, and Viator is the market leader by a substantial margin. TripAdvisor has a huge opportunity to connect its enormous user base with its large and growing collection of activities and tour operators globally.Non-Hotel has reported revenue of $274 million over the last twelve months, should generate $289 million in 2016, and will probably do about $340 million in 2017. This segment's profits are around breakeven because they are aggressively investing to expand around the world, most significantly in the attractions and restaurants businesses.So what is this segment worth? Let's start off with revenue growth. This segment grew revenue 35% year-over-year last quarter and has an enormous runway ahead of it. TripAdvisor CEO Steve Kaufer believes the attractions piece alone is the company's next billion dollar revenue business. To be conservative, let's say revenues slow dramatically to a 10% CAGR over the next 10 years. Revenue in 2026 would be $749 million. For what it's worth, I think this would be a disappointment.Next, we have to consider what operating margins businesses of this type earn at scale. There are some good precedents we can look to. Comparable companies at scale are very profitable.Based on these close comparables, it seems clear to me that the Non-Hotel segment should be able to achieve at least 30% operating margins at scale. Assuming a 27% tax rate (due to its global revenue mix), NOPAT margin would be 21.9%. That suggests 2026 NOPAT of $164 million.I believe this segment would be worth a 4% NOPAT yield or better at this point in the future due to the very high ROIC model and still enormous growth opportunity in front of it. That suggests the segment would be worth at least $4.1 billion.Discounting that value to the present at a 10% rate suggests the segment is worth about $1.6 billion today. In a more optimistic scenario (laid out in the ""High"" column), it would be worth about $2.5 billion today. Please refer to Exhibit 1.Backing out the value of the Non-Hotel segment from today's enterprise value suggests the core Hotel segment is trading for only $3.7-$4.6 billion. Please refer to Exhibit 2.Let's put some basic valuation metrics around that.So even assuming Non-Hotel is worth the low end of my valuation range, then TripAdvisor's Hotel segment is available for 3.8x revenue, 16.8x EBIT, 14.1x EBITDA, and a 4.3% NOPAT yield on 2016 numbers. These metrics scream cheap to me given the Hotel segment's enormous content moat, triple-digit returns on tangible capital, secular trends favoring online travel, and enormous growth opportunity.For perspective, here is TripAdvisor's trailing EV/EBITDA multiple over time.The average multiple has been 29.6x since it was spun off from Expedia. Given that the Non-Hotel segment was not relevant until fairly recently, I believe this overall company trading data is comparable to the 14.6x EBITDA multiple for the Hotel segment. In other words, TripAdvisor's core Hotel business is currently trading at less than half its average historical EV/EBITDA multiple.In addition, the profitability metrics in Exhibit 3 are extremely depressed due to the global rollout of Instant Booking, which has been an intentional strategy to improve profitability over the long term at the expense of short term profits. For example, Hotel EBITDA margin, counting stock-based compensation as a real expense, should be around 27% this year. The comparable figure ranged between 36%-44% during the three years between 2012 and 2014. That was pre-Instant Booking. So the Hotel segment's normalized profitability is much, much greater. But even if one isn't quite sure about the upside of Instant Booking, the low valuation ratios at which the Hotel segment is available for suggest to me that only modest growth, if any, is priced in. Simply put, TripAdvisor's core Hotel business is trading for a trough multiple of trough earnings.TrivagoAs a very interesting point of reference, Trivago (NASDAQ:TRVG) recently filed to go public. Trivago is majority-owned by Expedia and Expedia will continue to own a stake in the company post-IPO.Trivago's F-1 filing is revealing. While the company is growing revenues at a torrid pace, it is doing so by spending an unbelievable 92% of its revenue on selling and marketing expenses. The company remains unprofitable today despite having close to $800 million of revenue this year. Its most mature market, ""Developed Europe,"" appears to be in better shape than its newer markets like the U.S. and the rest of the world based on ""return on advertising spend"" or ""ROAS,"" but even Developed Europe's contribution profit does not cover the company's overhead expenses.It seems highly uncertain to me whether the company's three segments can scale enough for the business to be substantially profitable. Clearly, the company has no choice but to continue to pour huge sums into television advertising to drive users to its site with the hope that scale and profits will eventually come. But how sticky are those users if the company still needs to spend 75% of revenue on advertising in even its most established markets?Therein lies Trivago's problem. There is no compelling reason to draw users to its site. Metasearch hotel prices can be found at a fairly large number of sites. There does not appear to be anything differentiated about Trivago that would draw users to its site if they were not being bombarded by constant television advertising.In contrast, TripAdvisor spends ""only"" 50% of revenue on selling and marketing and even that is temporarily elevated due to the Instant Booking rollout. I suspect TripAdvisor's normalized selling and marketing expenses would be closer to 40% of revenue or perhaps lower. The reason for this is because TripAdvisor has a highly compelling reason for users to visit its site - the unmatched reviews and opinions content. TripAdvisor is synonymous with travel research, so its cost of user acquisition is a fraction of Trivago's.So what does the sell-side community think Trivago is worth? Cantor Fitzgerald and Cowen value Trivago at $5 billion or 5x their estimated 2017 revenue. UBS values Trivago at 4x sales, so perhaps $4 billion.Ok, so if one believes TripAdvisor's Non-Hotel segment is worth at least $1.6 billion, as I do, then investors appear to have the choice of buying Trivago - an unprofitable business despite $800 million of revenue with no credible reason for users to use its site over any other if they cut back television ad spending - for $4-$5 billion... or TripAdvisor's core Hotel business for $4.6 billion at most (or as little as $3.7 billion if Non-Hotel is worth more).As a reminder, TripAdvisor's core Hotel business will do about $1.2 billion of revenue this year, which is about 50% more than Trivago will do. Further, TripAdvisor's Hotel business is substantially profitable with adjusted EBITDA margins of near 30%, even despite the current headwinds from the Instant Booking rollout. Its normalized Hotel margins are likely 45% or higher over time. It is truly one of the world's best businesses with an enormous competitive moat, a long growth runway, and triple digit returns on tangible capital. And it is in no way reliant on something unsustainable like unheard of levels of television advertising spending.There is no question that informed industry insiders consider TripAdvisor the superior asset over Trivago by a clear mile. This apparently equivalent valuation will not persist indefinitely.So Why is TRIP Mispriced?TripAdvisor's earnings are deeply depressed in both of its segments as it invests aggressively in growth initiatives. These are smart long-term investments that should accelerate both revenue growth and profitability in the years ahead. However, the investment community only sees weak current consolidated results and does not generally have the patience for long-term, multi-year investments.Even more recently, TRIP has traded down another 8% in the last several days. I believe this is tax loss selling as some taxable investors may be selling TRIP to buy a stake in its controlling shareholder, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings (NASDAQ: LTRPA) instead. LTRPA is essentially a leveraged control position in TRIP, so swapping into LTRPA would maintain or even amplify one's exposure to TRIP due to the leverage. At the same time, the TRIP sales, assuming the shares were bought in the last few years at higher prices, would qualify as a loss and not qualify as a wash sale because TRIP and LTRPA should almost certainly count as ""substantially different"" securities (this is not tax advice).The evidence of this is the fact that LTRPA is now trading at an all-time high premium over its net asset value (""NAV"") of about 13%.Liberty TripAdvisor's assets and liabilities include about 31 million TRIP shares, a tiny business called BuySeasons that Liberty TripAdvisor pegged at a $25 million valuation two years ago but is probably worth $0 now due its continued struggles, $41 million of cash, and $461 million of debt. So at recent TRIP prices, Liberty TripAdvisor's NAV is about $1.04 billion or about $13.88 per share. Given it is now trading around $15.45 per share, that is a 13.5% premium.Interestingly, LTRPA's premium over its NAV has ranged from -2% to as high as today's 13.5% with the average being closer to 3%. Here is a graph I put together showing LTRPA's premium/(discount) to NAV over time.I believe the tax loss selling of TRIP and buying of LTRPA could be driving this. As a result, I expect TRIP to be an ideal candidate for a snap back ""January effect"" rally. Longer term, I remain very bullish on TRIP given today's lower price and the unrealistic expectations implied by the $46 per share stock price.Now, for the qualitative story...TripAdvisor's Evolving Revenue ModelOver the years, TripAdvisor has made major changes to the revenue model of its core hotel business.Originally, users interested in a particular hotel would be prompted to click on links for Expedia and other online travel agents (the ""OTAs"") to check rates. Users would get a pop-up window for each OTA they clicked on and they could check rates and complete a booking on any one of those partners' websites. The OTAs paid TripAdvisor a ""cost-per-click"" or CPC every time someone clicked. This was a profitable revenue model, but the large number of pop-ups made it not the best user experience.In 2013, TripAdvisor added metasearch functionality where users are shown all the available rates offered by the OTAs directly on the TripAdvisor site. Users no longer have to click off to check rates. Those who do are taken directly to the OTA's hotel booking page where they can complete their booking. The pop-up window model was extinguished. With metasearch, far fewer users click on the links as compared to the ""pop-up"" version since the rates are already shown, but those who do click are far more likely to complete a booking or ""convert"" on the OTA site. Essentially, with metasearch TripAdvisor sells fewer, but higher quality leads that convert at a higher rate. Metasearch initially weighed on TripAdvisor's financial results because it was new and users were not accustomed to it. Within about 12 months, metasearch's higher CPC pricing fully offset the fewer clicks and TripAdvisor achieved revenue neutrality. I believe metasearch was always intended to be a stepping stone towards adding booking functionality.In 2014, TripAdvisor began slowly rolling out the ability to book directly on TripAdvisor (""Instant Booking""). TripAdvisor collects the user's payment information and essentially passes the completed booking off to the OTA or hotel. The booking partner processes the transaction and handles all subsequent customer service. The big difference is TripAdvisor earns a percentage of the booking as a commission, much like the OTA revenue model, rather than a CPC for a lead that might convert.It took longer than management expected to get hotels and OTAs to join the Instant Booking platform. Some hotels initially expressed reluctance because they worried it was another expensive booking channel and they are trying to drive travelers directly to their own sites. Expedia and Priceline were initially reluctant because Instant Booking competes with them for bookings and the initial version of Instant Booking did not sufficiently highlight the OTAs' brands. Gradually, the hotels began to sign up because they liked paying a lower commission rate than they pay the OTAs and they saw it as a way to potentially gain share on TripAdvisor at the expense of the OTAs. Priceline finally agreed to join last fall after a long negotiating period once TripAdvisor improved the branding issue. Priceline wanted to not only avoid losing share to hotels, but also wanted its Booking.com to gain share in the U.S., which was made possible by an exclusivity period it negotiated with TripAdvisor that effectively shut out Expedia from the Instant Booking platform for a period of time. (While TripAdvisor and Priceline have not explicitly disclosed this exclusivity period, it is well understood in the industry. Obviously, both Expedia and TripAdvisor clearly want Expedia to join the Instant Booking platform, and this is the reason why that has not yet occurred to date.)Today, the Instant Booking platform has 8 of the 10 largest hotel chains in the world, a growing number of independent hotels, Priceline and its subsidiaries, including Booking.com, in addition to smaller players. Importantly, Expedia is also very likely to join once Priceline's exclusivity period ends.Closing the Monetization GapTripAdvisor's evolution towards Instant Booking is driven by a desire to close the monetization gap it has with its industry peers. TripAdvisor's peers make far more money per visitor than TripAdvisor does because TripAdvisor suffers from extensive ""leakage"" with metasearch. Leakage refers to the fact that TripAdvisor only monetizes a small fraction of its users.Leakage occurs because many TripAdvisor users read the site's content but do not click on the links. When they are ready to book at a later date, they may search the internet for the best price and/or go directly to an OTA or the hotel's site directly. TripAdvisor does not get paid for these users. Other TripAdvisor users click on metasearch links, but do not book immediately. When they are ready to book, some return directly to the OTA or hotel site directly, bypassing TripAdvisor. While TripAdvisor drove that booking and got paid for the click, it does not always get credit for driving the conversion. Since the amounts the OTAs bid for clicks in the metasearch auction are based largely on how effectively TripAdvisor's leads convert into bookings, in these cases, those bids are lower than they should be. Essentially, the OTAs and hotels are underpaying TripAdvisor.The other major impetus for Instant Booking has been the rapid growth of phone traffic (the tripadvisor.com mobile site and the mobile app). In 2012, TripAdvisor's phone traffic monetized at just 10% of the rate of desktop traffic because the user experience was so inferior. Given the ongoing mix shift towards phone traffic, TripAdvisor needed to improve the user experience to improve phone monetization. The clear opportunity was to allow users to complete a booking on the TripAdvisor mobile site or app to reduce friction and leakage.Enter Instant BookingInstant Booking was designed to get TripAdvisor more credit for the bookings it drives for its booking partners and to improve monetization, especially on the phone. For virtually all hotels, users now see metasearch links as well as an Instant Booking or ""Book Now"" option. Instant Booking rolled out to 10% of U.S. phone traffic in the spring of 2014. Management liked what they saw and expanded it to more phone traffic as well as desktop and tablet users. By September of 2015, Instant Booking was fully rolled out to all U.S. and U.K. users across all devices. It launched in all other English-speaking countries in January of 2016, the rest of Europe's major markets in February, and the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions in March. Instant Booking is now live globally on all devices.The Economics of Instant Booking and MetasearchIn the short-term, Instant Booking has a clear negative impact on TripAdvisor's financial results. Initial conversion rates are lower than metasearch and TripAdvisor is offering low initial commission rates to incentivize hotels and OTAs to join the Instant Booking platform.This negative impact is best illustrated by examining revenue per hotel shopper - TripAdvisor's key monetization metric. This metric has fallen from as high as $0.60 in mid-2014 to recent low of $0.45.Lower revenue per hotel shopper has had an adverse impact on Hotel revenue growth and margins.[Note: Hotel Adjusted EBITDA has been adjusted to exclude non-recurring television advertising spending in 2014 and 2015.]This has occurred because Instant Booking is taking share from metasearch, which despite its shortcomings was a relatively efficient model for TripAdvisor. Many of the OTAs ""bid to breakeven"" in the metasearch auction, meaning the OTAs' immediate profit from the converting leads simply pays for the cost of acquiring those leads. The OTAs are fine with that because they focus on the higher lifetime value of a user, not simply the immediate value.Exhibit 7 shows the key variables in play as it relates to the OTAs bidding in the metasearch auction. TripAdvisor and the OTAs do not explicitly disclose conversion rates and commission rates, so these numbers are estimates and meant for illustrative purposes.Essentially, the OTA would generate $255 of revenue assuming it converts 5% of metasearch clicks to completed bookings and captures 17% of the $300 average booking amount. Given the competitive nature of the metasearch auction and the OTAs' willingness to bid to breakeven, they might spend all that revenue on acquiring this traffic, so they might pay TripAdvisor up to $2.55 per click.Instant Booking's initial economics are much different. Conversion rates are lower than metasearch because it is a new user experience, and TripAdvisor's commission rates are lower than the OTAs earn because it is being promotional to incentivize booking partners to join the platform. Exhibit 8 shows how the lower conversion and commission rates result in lower ""effective CPCs"" for TripAdvisor than it earns through metasearch.As you can see, the lower conversion and commission rates significantly reduce the effective CPC that TripAdvisor makes. Importantly, the economics of Instant Booking should improve materially over time.Hotels to Gain Share As Auction Dynamic DevelopsInstant Booking should evolve into an auction dynamic as the supply of viable Instant Booking partners for every hotel increases. Hotels are joining the platform because Instant Booking significantly increases their ability to gain share on TripAdvisor at the expense of the OTAs.With metasearch, hotels could not effectively acquire leads because they were usually outbid by the OTAs for the top placements. This occurred because the OTAs convert metasearch leads better because they offer a wide selection of alternative hotel choices should the user pass on the original hotel choice; the hotels by definition only offer one choice.Instant Booking changes those dynamics. With Instant Booking, TripAdvisor is selling fully-converted bookings, not leads. TripAdvisor chooses its Instant Booking partner for a given hotel based on two variables: 1) the commission rate paid to TripAdvisor, and 2) the conversion rate.Hotels are currently signing up for Instant Booking and agreeing to pay 12%-15% commissions to TripAdvisor. Priceline and TripAdvisor have not disclosed the commissions Priceline is paying but I believe it is about 10% on average. So the participating hotels are more likely to ""win"" the Instant Booking button over Priceline or other OTAs because TripAdvisor will partner on a given hotel with the partner who pays the highest commission rate, provided that the hotel's conversion rate is sufficient.Imagine an independent hotel pays a 15% commission but only converts 3% of hotel shoppers, while Priceline's Booking.com pays a 10% commission but converts 8% of hotel shoppers. Generally, TripAdvisor will partner with Booking.com because the higher conversion more than offsets the lower commission and maximizes TripAdvisor's revenue.[Note: These figures are for illustrative purposes only.]Clearly, the hotels are incentivized to improve their conversion rates so they can be chosen as the Instant Booking partner more often. TripAdvisor is also incentivized to help the hotels improve conversion rates because that increases the supply of viable booking partners, making the auction more competitive. That explains why TripAdvisor is working with the independent hotels to improve their content, including room descriptions, room choices, and pictures. Better content leads to higher conversion rates. Some hotels are also offering lower room rates through Instant Booking than they offer through the large OTAs because they are incentivized by the lower commission rates.As hotels improve their content and conversion rates, they will increasingly be on comparable footing with the big OTAs as far as conversion. At that point, the booking partner that pays the highest commission rate to TripAdvisor will be selected as the booking partner. All of a sudden, Instant Booking becomes a competitive auction like metasearch.Enter ExpediaThe auctions will continue to get more competitive as more hotels and OTAs join the Instant Booking platform. Expedia is expected to join in the coming quarters after the exclusivity period that Priceline and TripAdvisor negotiated ends. On Expedia's second-quarter conference call in July, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the following:On Expedia's third-quarter conference call in October, Dara said this:At the RBC conference in November, Expedia's CFO Mark Okerstrom said the following in regards to when Expedia might join Instant Booking:Not to belabor the point, but Dara said the following at the PhocusWright conference later in November:To quote Vice President Joe Biden, ""This is a big [expletive] deal."" Expedia joining the Instant Booking platform will finally give Priceline some serious competition for its ""commission rate bids"" that it is paying TripAdvisor. I believe Priceline is paying a negotiated 10% commission rate to TripAdvisor, but it will raise those bids when Expedia begins bidding for those Instant Booking partnerships.Why? Hotels pay the big OTAs 15%-20% commissions. Given all these players are comfortable ""bidding to breakeven"" in their marketing channels, they should be comfortable paying TripAdvisor 15%-20% commissions to the Instant Booking partner on each hotel listing. In addition, the hotels are paying TripAdvisor 12%-15% commissions through Instant Booking, which is a bargain compared to the 15%-20% rates they pay the OTAs. So if the hotels on the platform want to remain competitive in the Instant Booking auction, they will either have to pay a higher commission or offer reduced rates through Instant Booking in order to offer the best conversion. Either would be great for TripAdvisor.Therefore, the commission structure should evolve from the left-side diagram in Exhibit 10 to the right-side diagram as more booking partners join the platform and the competitive auction dynamic develops.I will digress here for a moment. One might wonder what recourse Priceline would have. Clearly, they would prefer to keep paying a low promotional commission rate to TripAdvisor, and Priceline is the much bigger company, so why wouldn't Priceline just say ""no thanks""? They certainly could, but doing so would be nonsensical for their business. TripAdvisor is a tremendously valuable marketing channel for the OTAs. TripAdvisor sells an enourmous number of qualified leads, which help the OTAs grow their businesses. If Priceline refused to pay higher commissions to TripAdvisor, Expedia would gladly pay more and take that business. After all, the OTAs charge 15%-20% commissions to the hotels and they have a well-defined practice of bidding to breakeven levels in their traffic acquisition channels (since they make more profits from them in the long run), so they should be more than comfortable paying TripAdvisor meaningfully higher commission rates than 10%.Many people assume that TripAdvisor is hypercompetitive with the OTAs, especially now that Instant Booking has arrived. While it may be slightly more competitive, TripAdvisor is still primarily a partner to the OTAs, in my view. TripAdvisor's traditional metasearch clicks and the majority of its Instant Bookings are done in partnership with the OTAs, so it is in everyone's interest for TripAdvisor to continue to provide highly qualified leads. The more leads the better as far as the OTAs are concerned because they generally have the ability to buy an infinite number since they roughly breakeven on the immediate transaction and turn them profitable in the long run. This is true regardless of the fact that Expedia and Priceline own their own metasearch channels in Trivago and Kayak, respectively. The OTAs want to buy as many leads as possible from every source, assuming they can at least breakeven on the transaction.In the long run, I think conversion rates are the bigger wildcard than commission rates. If conversion rates on Instant Booking surpass metasearch conversion rates, which already seems to be occurring in Instant Booking's most mature markets, Instant Booking's economics will blow away that of metasearch. Exhibit 11 shows my rough approximation of how TripAdvisor's economics differ between metasearch, Instant Booking at launch, and Instant Booking at maturity.Exhibit 11 is intended to be a high level view of the transition TripAdvisor is undergoing, and the key variables are only rough approximations. The key question is ""How high can Instant Booking conversion rates and commission rates go over time?""Instant Booking ProgressDespite the recent weak financial results, TripAdvisor is making excellent progress with Instant Booking in the markets it has been in the longest. Instant Booking first launched to a portion of U.S. phone traffic and the company steadily increased the rollout as it liked the results. Next, it was rolled out to tablet and desktop users in the U.S. and U.K., then other English-speaking countries, then the rest of Europe, and finally in Asia-Pacific and Latin America earlier in 2016.In the company's third-quarter report, management indicated that TripAdvisor click-based and transaction revenue growth in the U.S. improved each of the three months and turned positive in September. U.S. revenue per hotel shopper troughed in the first half of 2016, improved to flat in 3Q, and is now positive. This progress was weighed down significantly by IB headwinds in the rest of the world because IB rolled out later in those markets and is still in the trough phase. If those global markets follow the same pattern as the U.S., they would turn flat or positive sometime in the first half of 2017. With the U.S. comping positive and either no drag or some tailwind from the rest of the world, I think overall revenue per hotel shopper should improve next year. As that improves, they will spend more to acquire traffic, which should accelerate hotel shopper growth.The company is seeing improving Instant Booking conversion rates, higher repeat rates, an increasing percentage of users who book with vaulted credit cards, and other important signs of progress. Revenue per hotel shopper has significant upside just getting back to where it was two years ago, but the purpose of Instant Booking is to improve that metric far beyond previous levels. This strategy will take time, but it does appear to be working.ConclusionTripAdvisor's stock is exceedingly cheap at $46 per share. I expect the stock to have a solid January when tax-loss selling stops, and to appreciate meaningfully over time after Expedia joins the Instant Booking platform, revenue per hotel shopper improves, and hotel shopper growth resumes its usual pace. I intend to hold TRIP for at least the next five years and expect to earn an annualized return well into the mid-teens or higher.RisksThe author manages a fund that has a long position in TRIP.

This treasure trove of user-generated content has enabled the company to build a high-margin, defensible business. There are three key pillars of our investment thesis on TRIP (which we will dive into in greater detail in our upcoming Company Scenarios and Research report):TripAdvisor's results have been significantly impacted by its business model transition. Starting in 2014 with mobile and mid-2015 on desktop, the company rolled out Instant Booking globally. Instant Booking provides (per TRIP) ""hotels and B&Bs a powerful new booking channel enabling travelers to easily 'Book on TripAdvisor'"" directly through the company website.As a result, revenue growth decelerated to 19.7% in FY2015 (from 31.9% in FY2014), and continued to decelerate through 2016 (with a significant impact on EPS).As shown in the chart below, TRIP's hotel segment revenue and margin profile have clearly been impacted since the transition started.While Instant Book has impacted the company's business results, we believe this setback is temporary in nature. This is evidenced by data from its 3Q16 earnings report, where management noted positive y/y trends in the U.S. in each month throughout the quarter (September was the first full month of y/y Instant Booking comparison in the U.S.).We believe TRIP is starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and the significant stock pullback in 2016 offers a compelling entry point for long-term investors who want to own one of the best assets in online travel.Could TRIP be an acquisition target?We also see the company as a potential acquisition target, presently ranked #7 on our 2017 Top 10 M&A Picks. TRIP itself has been through its share of M&A/divestiture activity since its founding in 2000, being acquired by IAC/Interactive (NASDAQ:IAC) in 2004, before spinning out from the Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) brand in 2011.Who are the likely candidates? TRIP has a solid brand and fleet of partners that, we feel, make it an attractive property. From a slightly defensive perspective, Priceline (PCLN) could be a likely contender, while from an expansion perspective, both Alphabet/Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could find substantial value.For additional insight into our perspective on TRIP's acquisition value, see our Samadhi Brief discussion below:Our Samadhi Index Ratings for TRIP are as follows (an explanation of the Samadhi Index Ratings can be found here):TRIP presently trades at $51.61 (52-week range: $45.63-71.69), with a market cap of $7.52 billion (a significant pullback off its highs of $108.66/share and $15.59 billion in 2014). The company is expected to report its 4Q 2016 earnings after the close on February 15, 2017.We are long TRIP, and hold it as a Revival in the Samadhi Capital client portfolios."
3989734,102040,2016-07-20T08:45:53-04:00,"Revenue being pressured as a result of limited growth on the user side and commission per click (i.e. CPC).New, highly anticipated initiatives such as IB and growth of Other segments stall.Premium valuation turns more in line with the industry norm.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has been climbing steadily since its YTD trough in February. This begs the question - is there more room to grow? From my research, I find that the consensus view has a rosy outlook on the adoption of Instant Booking (aka. IB), mobile usage and the non-hotel segment. I see 3 factors leading the stock price lower: 1) revenue being pressured as a result of limited growth on the user side and commission per click (aka. CPC); 2) new, highly anticipated initiatives such as IB and growth of Other segments stall; and 3) premium valuation turns more in line with the industry norm.Industry Outlook And Current Market DynamicsGathering data from a number of sources such as eMarketer and Phocuswright and making my own estimates, I built a TAM analysis on the online travel industry. Online travel spending is expected to grow worldwide and the U.S.'s contribution to the global market is also expected to tilt higher. Excluding the corporate travelers, whose market is dominated by Amex and Concur, I project a 7% CAGR in global consumer online travel spending that TRIP may benefit from.As of the end of 2015, TRIP boasts 350 million monthly average users (MAU) which represents 11% yoy growth. It homes 290 million reviews (82 million added in 2015 alone) on more than 5.3 million accommodations, restaurants and attractions. TRIP is also building out its ability to book restaurant tables at over 3 million reviewed restaurants. With the push to mobile, TRIP reached 290 million downloads of its mobile app at the end of 2015, with average monthly unique visitors via smartphone and tablet devices growing at 32% yoy. Currently, TRIP is trading at a premium to its peers, in both its immediate peer group (i.e. Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline Group (PCLN)) and the broader internet group (e.g. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Yelp (NYSE:YELP)). The higher valuation is supported by consensus view of ability to grow from a low trough, optimism on IB and new products, and strong user generated content.Investment Thesis1) Revenue under Pressure from Stagnating User Growth and CPC Compressiona) User Growth SlowsThe revenue stream with the most investor focus is click-based advertising (64% of the revenue), which is a function of 1) number of hotel shoppers, 2) conversion of hotel shoppers into revenue contributors, and 3) CPC. I believe that the number of shoppers and the conversion rate are stalling and possibly declining in the future. MAU declined for the first time in 2Q15 since TRIP went public.Although the absolute number of hotel shoppers is still growing yoy, changes in MAU ultimately dictate the growth in shoppers, repeat sales and TRIP's ability to charge higher CPC. Also, by the nature of the online travel industry, I do not foresee TRIP meaningfully growing its market share. As mentioned, click-based advertising accounts for 64% of the revenue, and revenue from PCLN and EXPE totals to 46%. This gives TRIP very little bargaining power when negotiating on terms such as CPC. A source estimated that EXPE and PCLN have around 66% combined market share. With the rest of the market rather fragmented, it is difficult for TRIP to stack up quickly. Another concern is that TRIP has the lowest direct vs. Google-directed traffic among the players.[source of the graph: sell side research]This means elevated spending on sales and marketing not only now but also likely much more in the future, especially since Google announced that it will place Google's own content ahead of organic search results and Google is building aggressively its own travel platform. Perhaps one of the biggest concerns is TRIP's reluctance to actively expand into China. The penetration of online travel in Asia is only 27%, compared to 45% in Europe and 43% in the U.S. China has a large influence in the region. TRIP's management publicly stated that it has no interest in working directly with Ctrip (CTRP) which has 75%+ market share in China, and it has sold a Chinese subsidiary in 2015. With the developed markets' growth plateauing and reluctance to actively compete in one of the largest economies, I see decline in shoppers traffic.b) CPC Being Compressed When Adopting IB and MobileOn the CPC side, revenue per shopper, which is a proxy for CPC, has been declining in the past two years. Part of this is due to industry wide evolution, offering competitive pricing. The biggest reason for above-average decline at TRIP is because of the push for adoption of IB and mobile. It is believed that TRIP currently gets paid 15-20% on its original CPC products, and has been offering suppliers a 10-15% commission on IB. The biggest suppliers, such as PCLN and largest hotel chains, are paying the lower end of the 10-15% range when asked to move to IB. As these players are often the most popular choices among hotel bookers and moving to IB does not largely affect consumer behaviors, I see the overall revenue shifting down, since the possible slight increase in volume is not expected to offset concession on commission. In addition, I do not believe that mobile is a source of accelerated growth for TRIP. The monetization and margin on mobile are about one-third of those on desktop. It is estimated that mobile traffic grew from 40% in 1Q14 to nearly 60% in 4Q15 while mobile revenue grew from 10% to 20% of total revenue, and the gap is widening. There are already formidable competitors in the mobile space. Google launched its travel platform on mobile called Destination. PCLN has spent a lot of effort partnering up with Facebook. Both Google and Facebook are similar to TRIP in that they have a lot of user generated content but they are arguably superior to TRIP given the other products in their broader ecosystems, making it harder for TRIP capture the growth of on the mobile side.2) Highly Anticipated Initiatives such as IB and Growth of Other Segments Do Not Delivera) Overly Optimistic on the Growth IB BringsThe biggest initiative that the current premium valuation hinges on is that IB adoption will drive growth starting 2H16. I disagree. IB was first rolled out in 2H14. As we saw in a previous graph, MAU actually declined/plateaued in 2Q15 when the management started a more aggressive rollout and this took a toll on revenue. TripAdvisor's main goal in rolling out IB has been to close the 4 - 5x monetization gap on its hotel shoppers when compared to PCLN and EXPE. This lofty goal became more nebulous as TRIP has been offering major suppliers 30% discount on commissions charged. As discussed, I see TRIP has very little bargain power to raise the price in the short to medium term because of its revenue structure, reliance on IB's success and the industry nature. An alternative way to reach revenue parity is to improve conversion by 25-30%; however, this is difficult to do in the near term especially when resources are pulled away to invest in IB and the Other segment. Furthermore, I see IB growth slowing and likely soon hitting a roadblock. 8 out of 11 largest hotel chains are already on IB, representing around 22% of total available hotel rooms around the world.[source: based on company earning calls]While Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) may be a low hanging fruit after the Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) acquisition, certain brands such as Jinjiang which is dominant in China and rest of Asia may be a huge challenge. The contributions from smaller hotel chains do not allow TRIP to scale up quickly because even the 9th to 11th largest hotel chains contribute to just around 2% of the available hotel rooms globally. Investors also optimistically expect EXPE to join IB soon, creating more scale for TRIP. However, I do not believe this move will be accretive to TRIP in the near term, even if it went through. EXPE would likely get a favorable commission rate just like PCLN did. As evident in the 4Q15, this actually hurts revenue. Many investors believe that IB is good for TRIP's long term growth. It makes booking simpler which may lead to higher booking rate and repeat sales. However, through a channel check conducted by Pacific Crest with 25 independent hoteliers in the U.K. and 20 in the U.S., they found that only two hotels in the U.S. have seen any material TRIP bookings through IB. At the same time, 73% of the respondents saw higher OTA bookings (how TRIP's original click-based advertising business operates) as a percentage of the total over the past 12 months. Another aspect of IB that the management highlighted was 10% repeat sales from IB in 2015. However, we must take the number with a grain of salt. This may be the first year that TRIP can reliably track its repeat sales. Click based ads direct consumers to external sites and TRIP's ability to track purchases stop there. A 10% repeat sales without basis for comparison is meaningless. Repeat sales occur naturally as time passes and better tracking becomes available. Last but not least, I am concerned about IB because the management has been very opaque about the whole progress and operation. From a behavior finance perspective, because it is such a crucial initiative, if it is going well, the company will be disclosing more info to boost investor confidence. The rollout of IB contributed $36M and $25M headwind to revenue and EBITDA, respectively, in 2015. The opaqueness points to large amount of uncertainty in IB's success.b) Exponential Growth of the Other Segment is Difficult to AchieveAbout 25% of the revenue is from vacation rental, local tour and restaurant bookings. The management expects this segment to grow into a $1 billion business in the long term. Assuming that long term means 5 years, TRIP needs to grow this segment at 22% CAGR. This is difficult to achieve. The vacation rental market is already dominated by HomeAway (owned by EXPE) and Airbnb. Flipkey, the vacation rental site owned by TRIP, has all sorts of issues such as unfair and expensive fee structure, inaccurate listings, technical difficulties, unresponsive support staff etc. On the local business side, while the market potential is huge, the fragmented nature makes execution and sustained, large growth extremely difficult. For example, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) topped $1B revenue in 2011 but have been struggling to maintain just single digit growth in the last 3 years. The cost of penetrating local market is also very high, putting more and more pressure on margins. Similar stories are observed at Angie's List and Yelp. Last but not least, TRIP is building out its ability to book restaurant tables at over 3 million reviewed restaurants. While this helps fulfill TRIP's goal of being a one-stop shop for travel planners, it won't help growing the revenue, as evidenced by SeatMe (owned by Yelp) and Table8 (owned by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)). Furthermore, the biggest player in the restaurant reservation space is Opentable, which is owned by PCLN. We see little competitive advantage TRIP may offer with its own booking system.3) TRIP's Current Premium Valuation Implies Large Room to Fall and Little Room to GainThe table below shows comparative valuation as of 4/12/16. We can see that TRIP trades at a premium relative to its immediate competitors and the broader internet group. The higher valuation is supported by consensus view of ability to grow from a low trough, optimism on IB and new products, and strong user generated content. TRIP's premium valuation has already priced in all the growth upside but as our analysis earlier shows, TRIP is unable to monetize effective from its rich content. The new product initiatives (IB, mobile, the Other segment) all pose high failure rate. Therefore, I believe that the stock has little room to gain but large room to fall.Even though TRIP has always tended to trade at a premium to its peers, the premium of its forward EV/EBITDA reached 1.3 standard deviation above its historical 2-year mean at the end of June.I have also done a DuPont analysis of its earnings in the past few years. I see that profitability (various margin measures) has been declining steadily though the company has become better at managing balance sheet (asset turnover, tax burden ratio, interest burden ratio, leverage ratio). As an investor, I want to prioritize return and growth.ConclusionIn summary, TRIP has been working on some interesting initiatives, which have drawn a lot of investors' attention. However, its revenue seems to have little room to grow. Its two major initiaitves, growing IB and the Other segment, have been stalling. Therefore, it does not warrant a premium valuation priced by the current market.General disclaimerThe content contained in this blog solely represents the opinions of the author.

3974916,65113,2016-05-13T12:52:00-04:00,"TripAdvisor is estimated to be overvalued based on its price-to-free-cash-flow ratio.The rising costs associated with advertising, coupled with increased competition from peers, are becoming increasingly unsustainable.I take a bearish view on this company.","In the following article, I conduct a free cash flow analysis of TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) for the next five years using differing rates of free cash flow growth and discount rates. Recently, TripAdvisor has been coming under pressure in that the company has seen a high increase in the cost of revenue due to online traffic acquisition costs. For instance, while click-based advertising revenue has continued to grow driven primarily by an increase of 17 percent in hotel shoppers, this has also been accompanied by an increase in direct costs such as ad serving fees, transaction fees and data center costs. For instance, direct costs increased by 72 percent from $18m in 2013 to $31m in 2014. In this regard, rising costs could well drown out rising revenues going forward.As the company has expanded, it appears that its cost base has been very significant, and TripAdvisor very well risks an eroding of its competitive advantage in this regard. Moreover, the industry is becoming increasingly saturated with competition from firms such as Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) particularly growing in the hotel booking space. While TripAdvisor has been maintaining somewhat of a competitive advantage by expanding into the vacation rental space through the acquisition of HouseTrip, along with integrating ""instant booking"" features for hotels, the fact remains that costs will continue to rise with expansion. In this context, TripAdvisor could well find it difficult to maintain a differentiation advantage, and revenues - and hence cash flows - will suffer as a result.In this context, I model future price targets for TripAdvisor under four separate scenarios:1) No growth in free cash flow given a 5% discount rate2) No growth in free cash flow given a 10% discount rate3) 10% growth in free cash flow given a 5% discount rate4) 10% growth in free cash flow given a 10% discount rateScenario 1Price target: $44.89Scenario 2Price target: $35.57Scenario 3Price target: $72.30Scenario 4Price target: $57.29From the above, we see that given the four scenarios, only a 10% growth in free cash flow given a 5% discount rate would mean that TripAdvisor yields a profitable rate of return of 2.53% per annum. In other words, the required rate of return (or as a benchmark, the rate of growth on a major index such as the S&P 500) would have to be at 5% or less in order for TripAdvisor to yield a positive rate of return.Taking the above into consideration, given increased competition in the industry along with a rising cost base, the company could well find it difficult to increase free cash flow going forward. Even if the company succeeds in doing so, a free cash flow analysis would suggest that there remains significantly more downside than upside. In this regard, I take a bearish view on TripAdvisor and see the company as being overvalued at the price of $64.19 at the time of writing. While I do not see the company drastically underperforming the market given its brand image and influence, free cash flow levels could be a concern and the company could see a price range of $40-50 going forward."
3996228,102040,2016-08-05T03:08:56-04:00,"Continued weak growth in the number of shoppers due to slower industry trend, competition and lack of international expansion.Commission per click depressed due to poor mobile monetization and Instant Booking roll out.Instant Booking won't be an instant revenue booster as many envisioned.Structural and execution issues will linger more than one quarter.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) reported a disappointing Q2 earnings after market close on Wednesday. The company missed both top and bottom lines, as well as other important metrics such as hotel shopper growth and commission per click (i.e. CPC). Full press release is available.The Q2 performance was in line with a number of weak spots I called out in my latest article. With the latest earnings result, my overall thesis is little changed. I continue to be bearish on the company's turnaround effort. Q3 will be a crucial quarter to watch for. The management has previously promised significant operating and financial improvement in 2H16 as the roll-out for Instant Booking (i.e. IB) becomes fully completed. Therefore, even though the Q2 earnings missed badly on a very low expectation, the stock was down 8.4% today, still reflecting some hope for improvement in the second half of the year.There were three main theses in my last article. Here is how they have evolved and where I expect them to head in the near future:1. Revenue being pressured as a result of limited growth on the user side and CPCI continue to be bearish on user growth. Hotel shopper growth declined to 3%, despite 5% growth YoY in marketing spend. The travel segment has been soft lately due to many security concerns. The management even pointed out in the earnings call that it sees slower trends in June and July. This is concerning, as summer travel used to be the hottest quarter for travel companies. There is also a more elevated concern for competition. Competitors such as Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN) have also been struggling for growth. TRIP is not at an advantage for competition. EXPE and PCLN have higher quality subsidiary businesses than TRIP does. TRIP depends highly on SEO (i.e. Google search generated) traffic.SEO traffic has slowed in Q2, partly because Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is ramping up its own travel business. Google has previously said that it is free to place results from Google products before those of competitors. This would erode into TRIP's margin. It now needs to spend more money on marketing, with potentially suboptimal results.Perhaps the biggest problem I have with TRIP is that it continues to retreat in international markets while focuses on the competitive North America market. In Q2, revenue from North America was up 6.6% Y/Y vs. 4.9% last quarter. EMEA is down -7.9% Y/Y (vs. -8.3% Y/Y in the prior quarter); APAC: -25.0% Y/Y (vs. -11.9% Y/Y in the prior quarter); LATAM: -31.6% Y/Y (vs. -26.3% Y/Y in the prior quarter). Penetration of online travel ex-business travel in APAC is about 27%, compared to 43% US and 45% Europe. Middle East and LATAM are looking at below 20% penetration rate. To increase market share and preserve long-term growth, TRIP should pursue new markets rather than battling the limited turf at home.Another aspect of the revenue function, CPC, has seen little improvement. At the end of 2015, mobile monetization was only at 30% of desktop. Sell side analysts estimated that mobile monetization improved a mere 2% y/y ex-FX. This slow growth is concerning as desktop hotel shoppers declined an estimated 7% y/y. In another word, TRIP is losing valuable revenue, mostly because it failed to develop an efficient mechanism to capture them on mobile. Furthermore, the commissions from click-through booking and instant booking have not improved. Concessions are still given out on the latter platform. The overall slowness in the industry also depresses commissions. More importantly, as alluded to earlier, competition also increased. This means that TRIP needs to spend more money to win new customers. It is frustrating to see that the company cannot monetize them effectively on those hard-earned businesses because of structural and execution issues.2. New, highly anticipated initiatives such as IB and growth of Other segments stallI still believe that optimism on IB was over-hyped. It was a good long-term strategic pivot for the company, but it will not be a game-changing revenue generator in the short term as expected by investors. I have discussed a number of concerns with IB in the last section and/or my previous article: 1) depressed CPC associated with IB; 2) limited growth in offerings now that 8 out of 10 major hotel chains are onboard. Furthermore, North America, the most mature IB platform, was launched in 2H14, and it is now growing at mid-single digit. This gives us a preview of how IB would evolve over time for all IB markets, without taking any haircut of the effect of TRIP's withdrawal abroad. It will not be a major revenue booster. In addition, it is questionable whether IB is successful in diverting shoppers from traditional click-through booking. Those suppliers are mainly OTAs, which use optimization to scrape the web to find the cheapest pricing. There has been multiple citing that claim prices through IB can be slightly higher than click-through. Also, sites such as EXPE have loyalty programs that reward shoppers for continuing to book with their sites. These programs can keep consumers from using IB.The growth of Other segment still remained strong at 22% YoY this quarter (vs. 14% YoY in Q1). This is one of few green shoots in this earning report. To become a $1 billion business by 2020, this segment needs to grow at 20%+ annually. As mentioned, locals and vacation rental markets can be expensive to acquire and maintain. Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) was only able to sustain a 20%+ growth for less than 2 years. The addition of new vacation rental homes has already slowed for TRIP this quarter. I will need more evidence in the future to become confident in this segment. Overall, the Other segment has not been a focal point for investors, thereby having little impact on stock price.3. Premium valuationIn my previous article, my third thesis was on TRIP's premium valuation. With the price dropping 8.4% today, it is still trading at a higher multiple than my estimate. As this name is categorized as a growth stock, much of the pricing depends on sentiment. I feel there are still a lot of people betting on a turnaround in 2H16, as initially guided by the management. I think this is unlike. On the earnings call today, even the management language has changed. It pointed to softness in June and July.In summary, I believe that a lot of problems associated with TRIP are on the structural and execution fronts. In terms of structural problems, the whole travel industry is facing competition risk and terrorism fears. There already exist formidable competitors, namely EXPE, PCLN and GOOGL. Transitioning from providing free travel resources to more efficiently monetize bookings is not easy under this environment. Also for IB, it is not easy to take away the concession on CPC initially offered to suppliers when the platform is still in a somewhat nascent stage. In terms of execution problems, I disagree with the approach to shrink international businesses. Those markets could be good for diversification, and new ways to capture market shares and build scale. On the mobile side, clearly managements need to think of better ways to monetize the traffic. Visits on phones and tablets have increased substantially. This is all easy revenue based on existing traffic. Last but not least, it seems that TRIP has been very focused on marketing and promotion in order to attract shoppers. This has failed as increase in marketing cost has outpaced increase in shoppers. This strategy will likely become increasingly ineffective given fierce competition. The management therefore should focus on optimizing the product and user experience for sustainable future growth.I believe that the firm is making the right decisions to transform its business to be better equipped for the long term. Nonetheless, there are a lot of structural and execution issues which won't be resolved in a quarter or in the short term."

Segment is mostly transaction/subscription based.Incoming Structural ChangesMonetization - We think TRIP is making a shift towards increasing profitability which Wall Street hasn't given enough attention. Includes ""instant booking"" rollout which should eventually normalize to revenue/shopper towards metasearch (priority listing order payments) levels. Monetization should boost Revenue/User Base towards similar levels of Priceline (PCLN)/Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) who have longer tenure within the industry. TRIP is early stage application which we believe will realize substantial value once it matures. Similar to our Sohn 2015's pitch on Tinder's unrealized value before its monetization rollout, we think Wall Street has been too conservative in its estimates.Non-Hotel/Other - In 2014, business grew 141%; in 2015, segment grew 106%. We think there is opportunity within attraction space specifically. Why? Global travel is being shaped quite differently than it was a generation ago. From a millennial perspective, we've noticed differences in travel style which have differed from our corresponding parents.Millennials are Travelling More:Millennials Rely on Technology to Travel:Source: Market Connections Federal Media & Marketing Study / Douglas BurdettAttractions bookingThe non-hotel booking business segment is continuing its rapid pace of growth and increasing monetization will make it an integral part of TRIP's business model. One specific area of this segment to note is TRIP's attractions booking business. Attractions booking is expected to grow at torrid pace of ~36% in 2016 and 28% in 2017, primarily due to the company's early entrance in the industry and increasing penetration rate. The North American and European attractions market is anywhere between $100B-$125B but has historically been highly fragmented. TRIP has been establishing itself as the dominant player in this market through acquisitions of Viator and LaFourchette (rebranded as 'The Fork'). The business model for TRIP attractions booking has been to expand various services, increase distribution capabilities for small-scale providers and then cross-sell these attractions to customers from its hotel booking platform. TripAdvisor, through Viator, currently collects about 20%-30% of commission of the booking amount and is rapidly increasing inventory to drive volume. In the long run, expect similar acquisitions such as the Viator one by TRIP to expand its offering and establish itself as the global niche market leader in attractions.How Can TripAdvisor Capitalize on These Structural Changes?Moreover, which TRIP segments (detailed above) will they affect? Evidently, numerous travel tailwinds could indicate any amount of positive indicators for investors for the online travel industry, but the name of the game becomes valuation. That is - converting qualitative information in quantitative metrics which can be built into a model. We think the difficulty of doing so has created an invisible barrier for investors interested in the group and TRIP in specific. Difficulties in valuation presents largely misunderstood opportunities/creates market misallocations when it comes to negotiating with Mr. Market.TripAdvisor's Rise to ProminenceGoogle Trends' explanation of ""Interest over time"" units:Using values for May 2016's Interest Over Time, a comparison can be made between each company's revenue generated per interest unit.Based on Revenue per unit of ""Interest,"" TripAdvisor appears to be having difficulty in converting its large search interest into revenue dollars. Although this may appear to some as an inefficient process, we view this as a ""window of opportunity."" We think its revenue is capitalized to grow with coming monetization. If TRIP can generate half as much revenue per Google search interest, it can triple to quadruple the size of its revenues.Going Back to Revenue SegmentationOutlined in TRIP's Q1 2016 conference call was a 1Q16 Supplemental Financial Information excel document that provided easier access to performance numbers. Although similar excel documents have been provided in the past, we haven't seen the traffic and revenue/shopper metric breakdown. See a list of TRIP provided event documentation here or on its IR page.Shifting market trends are evident as TripAdvisor moves from a largely hotel-based customer base towards being known for everything else (attractions, tour booking, subscription based models). It doesn't seem to make much sense to keep competing in the hotel industry (especially since its revenue/hotel shopper is decreasing). The hotel segment has been subject to competition in the form of new technological entrants either than TRIP. TRIP's opportunity comes in the form of being able to capture the new Millennial demographic base which will act as a future tailwind once a larger portion reach more affluent statuses. Cheaper travel accommodations have been primarily taken over by Airbnb for groups and HostelWorld for backpackers and one-time travelers alike.On a side note, we foresee giants like Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and PCLN suffering from new alternatives like SkyScanner which provides free price comparisons. Although SkyScanner does often end up linking to websites like EXPE and PCLN, we think the general travel experience is moving towards lower fees for OTA intermediaries. TRIP, on the other hand, has the benefit of the network effect where it has a community of users dedicated towards differentiating TRIP to any similar alternatives. We think TRIP is better suited than Yelp for customer reviews. It appears as if its contributor base provides more accurate reviews and reviews more so where travelers actually need them. Whereas YELP might be more useful for local residents within a city, TRIP appears easier to navigate for a traveler looking to check out things to do in a new city. This appears to be the sentiment from talking to fellow travelers and friends in the younger age demographic. Based on general sentiment, we think TRIP deserves a slight premium multiple based on opportunity for market monopolization within its own niche and a transition away from markets with declining margin.These sentiments translate into our segment based views:Instant Booking:TripAdvisor in Sohn New York 2016:""We believe that TripAdvisor has the potential to be the tollbooth for the global travel market,"" Danaher noted in his presentation, highlighting attractive growth in online users. TripAdvisor is currently the ""world's largest travel site,"" according to Danaher, with 350 million mobile-active users and 320 million reviews.""These engaged users ... draw more and more sellers,"" Danaher said of what he calls a ""virtuous circle"" that has consistently pulled in more Web advertising from restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues.TRIP's Treasures to Be Put on DisplayTRIP is a gold mine waiting to be found. Although chances at it being a homerun isn't a certainty, it's definitely worth the shot as it continues to expand its instant booking platform and captures the future tech-savy and younger generations of travelers."
3959061,101410,2016-03-16T17:22:57-04:00,"TripAdvisor could outgrow its former parent Expedia.The company's instant booking feature could help it better monetize traffic.Since the spin-off, TripAdvisor has underperformed Expedia, but from now on, the opposite may very well happen.","The CEO of Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) Dara Khosrowshahi sounded like a proud, nurturing father sending his beloved child to strike on his own when the booking company spun off travel review website TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) in 2011. ""It is a matter of size, globalization and diversification of revenues,"" he said at the time. ""It is really ready to stand on its own."" Ever since, TripAdvisor has been slowly shifting its business model toward one competing with its former parent. Khosrowshahi should be proud and worried at the same time.The rationale behind the spin-off decision was to unlock shareholder value, as TripAdvisor had been growing at a much faster pace than its parent. Another reason for the separation was it allowed both companies to focus on their core markets. But even if TripAdvisor's revenue growth has not disappointed in the years following the spin-off, it has not been much higher than Expedia's. On average, TRIP's income has increased about 24% per year over the past four years while EXPE's average yearly growth over the same period has been just six percentage points lower, at 18%.Shares of TripAdvisor have underperformed Expedia significantly since the spin-off. If you were to buy TripAdvisor's stock immediately after it was floated, you would have by now a return on investment of about 139%. Although impressive, that number pales in comparison with what an investment in Expedia would have yielded over the same period - more than 335%.2015 has been a turning point for both stocks, with Expedia edging significantly higher and TripAdvisor languishing. Investors likely woke up to the reality that hotel booking was more valuable than hotel reviewing. Net income also played a role, however. While Expedia's 2015 profit nearly doubled compared to 2014, TripAdvisor's decreased about 12%.But there is a catch. In 2015, the travel firms adopted slightly different strategies to grow their business. While Expedia has leveraged its balance sheet to make $6 billion worth of acquisitions, with the $3.9 billion purchase of HomeAway being the most notable, TripAdvisor chose to grow organically by launching its promising instant booking feature. Needless to say, the new feature required more capital and ate into TripAdvisor's margins and, together with rising marketing costs, impacted net income figures negatively in 2015. By contrast, Expedia has seen its acquisitions boost the bottom line despite experiencing similar headwinds as TripAdvisor - increasing marketing costs and currency issues.Stepping on its parent's turfSince the spin-off, many in the investment community have predicted TripAdvisor will compete with its parent for the same, though increasing pie. The relationship between the companies had been known to be complicated - friendly but competitive. However, Expedia's decline to join instant booking has made their relationship even more tense, and removed all doubts as to whether the firms are even partners anymore. The sides are competitors, but depend on each other for a stream of revenues. Indeed, 46% of TripAdvisor's revenue comes from Expedia and Priceline (PCLN), another competitor. But the revenue dependence on Expedia has been steadily decreasing over the past few years. In 2015, EXPE accounted for 11% of TRIP's accounts receivable, down from 33% in 2011. The downward change means one thing: TripAdvisor has been diversifying away from its dependence on Expedia.Instant booking - changing the gameWith the launch of instant booking in 2014, TripAdvisor made a step towards offering a more comprehensive travel-related service. And it has an edge over its competitors. With its millions of reviews, it has the so-called network effect. So far, the company has been largely failing at properly monetizing this network effect. And that's mainly because - as co-founder and CEO Stephen Kaufer put it on a recent conference call - most of the traffic generated by TripAdvisor has been ""with a high research intent."" But Kaufer hopes the implementation of instant booking will change the consumer perception of TripAdvisor as just a good travel research tool, and they will see it more like a broad service attracting people already decided about making a reservation.With the network effect, instant booking has the potential of becoming a one-stop shop for all things travel, except transportation. An application or a website where one goes and finds reviews on places, restaurants and hotels, and then easily books anything he wants without leaving the web page or the application. The feature, however, is clearly aimed at mobile devices, and the company's management made that clear. The firm has already signed Priceline to its instant booking feature and nine most important hotel chains.When the feature was rolled out in 2014, Expedia declined to join, invoking the platform's unattractiveness as its main reason. But on the company's most recent conference call, Khosrowshahi suggested that he may change his mind, perhaps driven by the fear of missing out on earnings opportunities. On the same conference call, he said revenues had been negatively impacted by the roll-out of instant booking, although downplayed its effects. But, as instant booking becomes more popular across many countries, Expedia will be forced to join, making it a question of when than if.Khosrowshahi's Expedia should be proud because TripAdvisor has been succeeding at standing on its own feet, and worried because its former subsidiary could very well outgrow it.Long-term investmentThat being said, TripAdvisor is a long-term play. The market has not taken very well the firm's short-term fall in earnings, bidding down the stock 20% in the past 12 months. But that could be an opportunity to buy the stock. The management is not very optimistic on earnings for the year 2016 because it expects to continue investing in its instant booking service. With the market positioning itself for modest earnings, a positive surprise will boost the stock.However, TripAdvisor's great test will be whether its instant booking gathers steam. If that will happen, the potential upside is significant. Alternatively, the company will still have its lucrative metasearch business, making the downside limited."
3988226,79555,2016-07-13T15:39:31-04:00,"TripAdvisor has substantially and consistently increased revenue over the past few years.
        The company continues to increase its userbase.
        Despite slight recent declines in net income and cash flow from operations - which didn't truly represent the company's health - the company is still in a great position and
        The company's recent decline in price also presents an great opportunity for the diligent investor.","OverviewTripAdvisor Inc. (NASDAQ: TRIP) runs a number of leading online travel brands. Their flagship site, TripAdvisor, is the world's largest travel site and its primary purpose is to help users plan and book their vacations and trips. The company does this by compiling millions of travelers' reviews of destinations, attractions, and activities. Users can also compare real-time pricing and availability so they can book hotels, rentals, flights, restaurants, and other activities.Their sites garnered 350 million unique average monthly visitors during 2015. The website features 320 million reviews on 6.2 million places around the world. The company also runs 23 other travel media brands, which all focus on slightly different aspects of the travel and booking industry.Business ModelClick-Based AdvertisingThe company's largest source of revenue is click-based advertising. These ads feature links to partners' booking sites. These advertising partners are predominantly online travel agencies and direct suppliers to in the hotel, airline, and cruise product categories. Advertisers pay on a CPC basis, meaning they pay a certain amount per click on their ad.Advertisers bid on how much they are willing to pay for a certain ad. These bids occur periodically, sometimes as often as daily or weekly. The system to choose advertisers is automated, and the highest bid wins the ad.Click-based advertising also includes commissions from bookings. If a user books a reservation through TripAdvisor, the company gets a commission. The company began rolling out this feature starting in June of 2014 with hotels in the US and UK, and plans to continue to roll out this feature internationally in 2016.The company has had great growth in click-based revenue over the past few years. For the years, 2015, 2014, and 2013, they earned. $956 million, $870 million, and $696 million from click-based advertising, respectively. Meanwhile the percentage of their revenue from click-based advertising shrunk, from 74% in 2013 to 70% in 2014 to 64% in 2015. This means that, even as the company has great growth in its click-based advertising revenue, other revenue streams are also earning more and more, at an even faster rate.Display-Based AdvertisingDisplay-based advertising is essentially the same as click-based advertising, excepts advertisers pay a certain rate per thousand impressions of their ad and not clicks.Revenue from these ads increased from $119 million in 2013 to $140 million in 2014 to $159 million in 2015. Meanwhile, the percentage of total revenue from these ads shrank from 13% to 11%.Subscription- and Transaction-Based RevenueThis revenue stream allows advertisers to list, for a set amount of time, their URL and contact information and to post special offers. TripAdvisor also earns revenue by making hotel bookings available on their transaction-based sites.In 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company made $377 million, $236 million, and $130 million, respectively, from this revenue stream. It's their fastest growing revenue stream, with its total percentage of revenue increasing from 14% in 2013 to 25% in 2015.EarningsRevenues for the company grew 32% from 2013 to 2014 and 20% from 2014 to 2015. Despite the great increase in revenue (which was explained in greater depth earlier), net income still decreased.TRIP Net Income (Annual) data by YChartsThe reason net income has decreased (albeit less, relatively, than the graph above would indicate) is because of increased costs. The company spent 38% more on selling and marketing in 2015 than it did in 2014, and spent 36% more in 2014 than in 2013. The company also spent substantially more on technology and content, and other general expenses. As a result of these expenses, net income decreased 12% from 2014 to 2015, going from $226 million to $198 million. Net income in 2013 was $205 million.A lot of the increase in selling and marketing costs was a result of the company's increased spending on SEM, which when companies pay money directly to have a more favorable position on aggregate search engine sites like Google. The also spent $51 million on TV advertising.The company also had an increase in general expenses, but the increase in this category is mostly due to a charitable contribution, which the company calls the Foundation, worth $59 million. The company decided to pay off it's commitment to the Foundation in a one-time payment, and did so in 2015. It will no longer have to give money to the foundation.Cash FlowTRIP Cash from Operations (Annual) data by YChartsThe company's cash flow from operations also decreased slightly, from $387 million to $382 million, a 1.3% decrease. However, the company's cash flow from operations is extremely impressive when we consider that the net income from which the cash flow from operations is derived from was 12.4% less than what it was the previous year. Overall, the company's cash flow from operations looks strong and healthy.Book ValueIt might seem superfluous to worry too much about book value with a technology company, but it's still worth noting that the company's book value has consistently increased over the past few years.TRIP Book Value (Annual) data by YChartsCan the Growth Continue?There's no doubt that TripAdvisor has experienced significant growth over the past few years. But the big question, as an investor, is whether or not the growth will continue to occur.It looks like it will. The company has begun a more aggressive advertising campaign that has paid dividends over the past two years. The company is also aggressively improving revenue streams generated from mobile ads, since 53% of users access TripAdvisor from their mobile device. The company also saw excellent growth in its instant booking revenue stream, which is convenient for users and provides higher profit margins. The company now has deals with 7 of the top 10 major hotel chains in the world for the direct booking service. Vacation rental listings also grew 18% to 770,000 properties.The company is also the leader in its field in terms of user base, and since it works with many of its competitors (Priceline, etc.), it also has leverage in the marketplace.TripAdvisor looks to be in great shape for the future.PriceTRIP data by YChartsTripAdvisor's stock has significantly decreased in value since September of last year - to the tune of 42%, with the sharpest and most lasting decline coming after January of this year, around the time the latest annual report was released. As we saw, although the company's net income and cash flow from operations decreased, the reasons for the decreases weren't a lack of quality in the business, but rather from a one-time expense. Cash flow from operations, which is the true test of a company's health, is still very healthy and almost certain to increase in the coming year and over the coming years as the service continues to grow.VerdictTripAdvisor seems like a terrific investment. It's a high growth stock with a management that clearly know how to run its business and invest capital with the highest rates of return for its shareholders. The recent sharp decline in price also presents an opportunity for investors to capitalize on."
3895346,67313,2016-02-14T22:52:18-05:00,"TripAdvisor reported earnings above consensus, with Instant Booking continuing to gain traction.Near-term spending will continue to weigh on EBITDA, but positive signs are evident.I remain bullish, and will get more constructive in the middle of the year.","TripAdvisor's (NASDAQ:TRIP) quarter once again confirmed my belief that 2016 will be another year of investment, given that Instant Booking (IB) has yet to be fully deployed and that the platform still needs additional partners to be signed on. Despite the greater level of investment and the near-term challenges that the company is facing, I believe long-term improvement in customer experience and transactional efficiencies will drive meaningful revenue growth trajectory, as users can seamlessly conduct hotel bookings. That said, I still consider TRIP quite attractive at 15x 2017E P/E when looking at the long-term growth prospects for the company.Revenue of $309m, +7% y/y, and EPS of $0.45 both came above consensus. The attack in Paris last year resulted in a 1.5-2% hit on revenue, but we could see gradual recovery as tourism resumes. Click-based revenue was down -1% versus +6% in the prior quarter. EBITDA of $87m was largely in line. Management stopped giving out formal revenue and EBITDA guidance, but provided some directional color on its Hotel and Other segments that I find to be quite helpful. First, hotel and click-based revenue growth is expected to be soft and likely to decelerate given the Instant Booking rollout and the tough comps. Management is more optimistic on the second half as the IB rollout in both the UK and the US takes effect. Notably, downstream conversion between meta and IB are close to parity, and we see continued improvement in IB conversion, with monetization/commissions remaining healthy at low-double digit rates, suggesting that there is limited dilution from arranged deals. Second, the growth in number of travelers returning to TRIP to book on IB remains healthy, and IB is now 50% of mobile revenue in the US. Given that average booking value continues to improve in the low-double digits and 10% of bookings are made by repeat customers, we could see an acceleration in IB metrics in the latter half of the year.On the same token, the EBITDA margin is likely to remain depressed due to the IB rollout. The Other segment is likely to be consistent with that of last year, but the EBITDA margin will also remain depressed on higher opex commitment. Management is quite bullish on the growth outlook for this segment. So am I, but I acknowledge the fact that near-term spending will keep EBITDA in check.Finally, supplier relationship appears to be solid with 8 of the top 10 hotels, and Priceline (PCLN) is already on the IB platform. In addition, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) made several positive commentaries about the quality of the platform, and this reinforces my view that IB will continue to gain traction among the suppliers.ConclusionI don't think the market gives IB enough credit given the near-term spending and slower-than-expected ramp up, but positive signs are evident from this quarter's results. TRIP remains a stock for long-haul investors, and I would be more constructive after Q2 as we get better visibility later in the year."

IBM (NYSE:IBM) is now letting developers use (through its cloud platform) a 5-qubit computer to ""run algorithms and experiments,"" as well as ""explore tutorials and simulations of what might be possible with quantum computing.""Unlike VR and AI, quantum computing is still ways off from seeing large-scale commercial use. Aside from the challenges involved in creating more powerful systems, size, cost and temperature requirements remain issues. Still IBM thinks ""medium-sized quantum processors of 50-100 qubits"" are possible within the next decade, and asserts none of the world's top 500 supercomputers ""could successfully emulate"" a 50-qubit computer. SA contributor BayesianLearner: ""Quantum computing will likely not bring in any needle-moving revenue for IBM or Google (GOOG, GOOGL) in the next decade… On the other hand, quantum computing is no longer infinitely a decade away.""Google has partnered on quantum computing with NASA and startup D-Wave Systems; the group claims it was able to run an algorithm on a D-Wave quantum computer (costs $10M) 100 million times as fast as they could on a regular CPU. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has partnered with memory tech developer Rambus (NASDAQ:RMBS) on quantum computing memory R&D.The 5-qubit processor that forms the heart of IBM's quantum computer.Bloomberg and 9to5 Mac: Apple planning major changes for Apple Music - Bloomberg reports Apple plans to alter Apple Music's UI, ""better integrate"" its music streaming and download services, and expand its online radio service. 9to5 Mac states the new UI will include 3D Touch shortcut previews, integrate song lyrics and better show off album artwork. The revamp is expected to be shown off this June at WWDC.Apple Music as it currently exists.Bloomberg also says the acquisition of the Beats Music streaming service (which Apple Music grew out of) ""sparked a rare culture clash within Apple that led to the departure of several key managers,"" and that Apple Music's new look is being overseen by iTunes content chief Robert Kondrk and (interestingly) Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor.Apple Music has seen its share of criticism - this post from former Macworld writer Jim Dalrymple is a good example - but has nonetheless added over 13M paid subscribers in ten months. That makes it the music subscription market's clear #2 player behind Spotify (MUSIC), which recently topped 30M paid subs.Google/YouTube reportedly plans online TV service, Hulu confirms it will launch one - The online TV space looks set to become very competitive - that's probably as much a testament to the willingness of TV network owners to license their channels as cord-cutting continues and ratings decline as anything else. Dish (NASDAQ:DISH) and Sony (NYSE:SNE) are already in the market and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is expected to join later this year. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been reported to be thinking of joining, though Apple's efforts are believed to have been suspended for now due to licensing issues.Bloomberg reports a YouTube TV service called Unplugged could launch by next year. Google could differentiate the offering by bundling its $10/month Red subscription service (provides ad-free YouTube, the Google Play Music subscription service, and some original content.) Hulu, meanwhile, has its on-demand streaming service as a bundling option. It remains to be seen how much leeway the company's old media owners will give it to provide inexpensive ""skinny bundles"" rather than more costly traditional packages.Priceline hammered due to soft Q2 guidance; European growth slows - Q1 results beat estimates (Priceline has a knack for guiding conservative and then beating), but Q2 guidance for 7%-14% Y/Y sales growth and EPS of $11.60-$12.50 fell well short of a consensus of 16.4% growth and $14.98 at the midpoints. Quite the contrast with Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), which jumped last week after beating estimates, affirming full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance, and reporting solid bookings growth.On its earnings call, Priceline said its guidance ""assumes that our growth rates will decelerate further as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends."" The company also mentioned its opaque listings (e.g., ""Name your own price"") continue to be affected by discounting/competition, and that it's assuming Q2 growth will be impacted by the Euro Cup and this year's Ramadan timing.One big difference between Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia: Whereas Expedia received 65% of its Q1 bookings from the U.S., Priceline got 89% of its Q4 bookings from international markets - a large portion involved European bookings done by the company's Booking.com unit. Notably, Priceline didn't break out its U.S. and international bookings in the Q1 report, as it has in prior reports. Total bookings rose 21% Y/Y (26% excl. forex), but Priceline is guiding (likely conservatively) for growth to drop to 11%-18% in Q2 in both dollars and constant currency. The numbers came a week after CEO Darren Huston resigned due to a relationship with an employee.TripAdvisor slumps after Q1 miss and weak click-based sales, blames Instant Booking - TripAdvisor's (NASDAQ:TRIP) click-based and transaction revenue, which covers bookings driven by its search platform and Instant Booking (allow for bookings on TripAdvisor's site/apps), fell 13% Y/Y in Q1 to $189M (54% of total revenue). In prepared remarks, the company primarily blamed a mix shift towards Instant Booking, which has lower monetization rates and often records revenue at the time a customer stays at a hotel rather than when he/she books. It also blamed forex, a shift to mobile traffic (lower monetization rates than PC traffic), and the sale of TripAdvisor's Kuxun Chinese travel site.Double-digit growth was still seen in other reporting segments (display ads, revenue from non-TripAdvisor sites, etc.), and free cash flow rose 51% Y/Y to $103M. Instant Booking, which TripAdvisor insists will be a long-term positive due to the greater convenience it provides customers, is said to support over 500K hotels following a recent international expansion.Fitbit tumbles after Q1 beat, mixed Q2 guidance, solid 2016 guidance; spending growth hurts EPS - Though most bear cases surrounding Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) have revolved around sales expectations - concerns about the addressable market for fitness trackers, upgrade rates among existing owners, and competition from Apple and others have been common - it was worries about the company's bottom line that led shares to dive post-earnings. Q2 EPS guidance was light in spite of above-consensus sales guidance, and Q1 net income (though topping consensus) was down 56% Y/Y in spite of 50% revenue growth.A 165% Y/Y increase in operating expenses raised eyebrows - sales/marketing, G&A, and R&D spend all rose by triple digits, with R&D headcount rising to 755 from 295 a year ago. There could also be some related concerns that Fitbit's sales momentum will slow once the company dials back its heavy marketing spend. CFO Bill Zerella says Fitbit is ""front-loading"" its R&D spend, and spent heavily to promote its Blaze smartwatch and fashion-oriented Alta fitness band - they launched in Q1, and accounted for at least 2M of Fitbit's 4.8M Q1 shipments.The Fitbit Blaze and Fitbit AltaSome positives: ~40% of Blaze/Alta buyers are said to be existing Fitbit owners (with most owning cheaper devices), international sales (30% of Q1 revenue) rose by triple-digits, and ASP rose 18% to ~$100. The company also promises ""exciting"" new products are coming by year's end. Questions about long-term usage/upgrade rates and smartwatch competition haven't gone away, but for now, Fitbit remains dominant in a still-growing fitness tracker market and has seen limited competitive pressure from Apple Watch, which starts at $299 and promises 18 hours of battery life under ""normal"" use (this can get in the way of using it for sleep-tracking).Qorvo surges after FQ4 beat and strong FQ1 guidance; Galaxy S7 helps - Qorvo's (NASDAQ:QRVO) post-earnings move is very different from the one seen by RF chip rival Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) last week, after Skyworks provided light guidance to go with nearly in-line results. But context is important here: Both companies are still guiding for moderate Y/Y sales declines for calendar Q2, as weak iPhone-related orders and a broader smartphone slowdown weigh. Qorvo, aided by Galaxy S7 content gains, appears to be making up ground lost to Skyworks and others last year.Merger cost synergies are also boosting Qorvo's bottom line: The company, which was formed by the merger of RF Micro and TriQuint, saw operating expenses drop 7% Y/Y in FQ4. Buybacks are helping as well: Another 10M shares were repurchased. Qorvo recently moved to grow its IoT exposure by striking a deal to buy ultra-low-power RF chipmaker GreenPeak Technologies.Microchip beats FQ4 estimates, offers fairly upbeat commentary - ""We entered the June quarter with a stronger backlog than we had going into the March quarter and the bookings and turns for the quarter so far have been strong,"" says Microchip (NASDAQ:MCHP), a microcontroller maker that's often seen as a chip industry bellwether. The company, which recently closed its acquisition of slumping rival Atmel, is providing in-line FQ1 guidance that's affected some by Atmel accounting changes. Peers NXP, STMicroelectronics, and Cypress Semi have provided in-line or above-consensus guidance in recent weeks, as the chip industry bounces from a recent inventory correction.Shopify slides in spite of Q1 beat, strong sales guidance - Both Shopify's (NYSE:SHOP) Q2 and full-year sales outlooks were above consensus. There could be some disappointment with the company's profit guidance - a $6M-$7M adjusted operating loss is expected in Q2, and a $16M-$22M loss is seen for the whole of 2016. Revenue rose 95% Y/Y in Q1 to $72.7M, and GMV driven by Shopify's platform rose 102% to $2.7B.Microsoft preps SharePoint iOS/Android apps, revamps traditional SharePoint with Office Graph - SharePoint, used by 200K+ organizations and 190M people for collaboration and file-sharing, will soon join the dozens of Microsoft apps now available on iOS/Android. Meanwhile, Microsoft has refreshed its existing SharePoint offerings to leverage data gleaned from a user's Office activity (referred to as the Office Graph) to push relevant info and content, and to integrate SharePoint with its OneDrive cloud storage service.Microsoft's upcoming SharePoint mobile appsThe company is hoping to slow the growth of cloud-based rivals such as Box (NYSE:BOX) and Dropbox (DROPB). While some comparisons have also been made between SharePoint and fast-growing Slack (SLACK), Slack is more focused on real-time collaboration, and thus more directly competes with Skype for Business. Between them, SharePoint and OneDrive's feature set is more comprehensive than what the likes of Box/Dropbox can provide, and the Office Graph can act as a selling point. The challenge is in fusing their various features into a cohesive, user-friendly, whole - complaints about SharePoint's traditional UI aren't hard to find.AT&T ends Yahoo portal-hosting agreement, turns to Synacor - Yahoo's (YHOO) deal with AT&T (NYSE:T), through which the company hosted Ma Bell's portals and e-mail services, was worth an estimated $100M/year. Yahoo will still host AT&T's e-mail, but that reportedly accounts for a fraction of the prior business related to the deal. Not the best of times for Yahoo to get the news, considering it just received first-round bids for its core business.Synacor (NASDAQ:SYNC), meanwhile, soared in after-hours trading on news it will now manage the Att.net portal, AT&T-branded apps, and search services. The company closed on Wednesday with just a $44M market cap.BlackBerry adds video chat support to BBM iOS and Android apps - Better late than never. Two years after adding voice calling to its iOS And Android apps, BlackBerry (BBRY) has added video calling (already supported by many rival messaging platforms). The company hasn't disclosed a BBM active user count since September 2014, when it was said to be at 91M. The BBM Android app surpassed 100M downloads in early 2015.Notable Tech Commentary and ReportsChannelMeter: Facebook videos live fast, die young - In a study of 1,700 videos, ChannelMeter (an analytics firm) found 75% of the videos' Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) views happened within four days of publishing. By contrast, 75% of the videos' YouTube views occurred within 79 days.The study highlights the differences in how Facebook and YouTube videos are consumed: Videos seen on Facebook tend to be fairly new content either published by a followed account or liked/shared by friends, while YouTube material is often (though not always) relatively older stuff pulled up via search or promoted via YouTube's ""Recommended"" feature. The takeaway: While there is certainly overlap between Facebook and YouTube viewing activity (particularly when it comes to videos shared by major brands and publishers), there are also video types for which one platform is much more popular than the other. That's worth keeping in mind as Facebook gets serious about taking on YouTube as a video hub.SA contributor Neil Cybart: iPhone Warning Signs - ""[T]here are a number of warning signs beginning to appear in the iPhone business indicating underlying deterioration,"" thinks Cybart after taking in Apple's FQ2 numbers. Among other things, he cites signs a longer iPhone upgrade cycle, slowing expansion in the number of supported carriers, high smartphone penetration rates in developed markets, and ASP/margin pressure stemming from the iPhone SE's launch.A successful iPhone 7 launch could quickly make rumors of a deteriorating iPhone business prove much exaggerated. But with annual sales declines having reached double digits during the 6S cycle, there's more pressure now for Apple to deliver a hit this fall that sparks strong upgrade activity. Contributor Mark Hibben argues Apple should scale back the number of older iOS devices supported by new versions of iOS, so as to enable apps that can better take advantage of the more powerful processors found in newer hardware (and in doing so, help drive upgrades).The Next Platform - Are ARM Server Chips Xeon Class, And Does It Matter? - Provides a technical look at Applied Micro's (NASDAQ:AMCC) X-Gene 3 ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) server CPU (due to ship in volume in 2017), and makes the case ARM-based server CPUs relying on advanced 14nm and 16nm manufacturing processes will be competitive for many applications, even as Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Xeon CPUs (currently dominate the data center) appear likely to maintain a lead in raw processing power. Cited applications include web services, content delivery networks (""CDNs""), and AI/machine learning applications for which much of the heavy lifting is done by GPUs.In addition to Applied Micro, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Cavium (CAVM) are targeting the ARM server CPU market. Intel is looking to keep Xeon rivals at bay in part by creating platform-level solutions for the hardware housing its processors.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

This is the second straight quarter in which shares have fallen sharply following results. In the second quarter, shares nosedived after TRIP announced a drop in earnings to 40 cents a share from 47 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter due to rising marketing-related expenses. In the preceding quarter, TRIP's selling and marketing related expenses rose to $192 million from $127 million in the year-earlier period.At that moment, however, I had argued in favor of TRIP citing the necessity to boost marketing-focused spending as it looks to gain traction in the fiercely competitive online reservation market.Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, TRIP not just competes with the likes of Google, Yahoo Travel, Bling Travel and Booking.com but sites like Airbnb, Kayak etc. also have changed the competitive landscape. In this backdrop, it is focusing on increasing its user base, which depends on widening its brand recognition.At the start of this fiscal, TRIP had anticipated its TV advertising budget alone at $60 million in order to reinforce its brand recognition. In the most recently concluded quarter, the marketing and advertising related budget rose by $38 million from the third quarter of 2014.While earnings are getting squeezed at the moment due to marketing related costs, it should not, in my opinion, deter long-term investors, given that TRIP is still evolving.Instant Booking feature improving top-line and growthTRIP's Instant Booking feature, which allows users to book hotel rooms without leaving TripAdvisor's site, including reservation through mobile phones, has been very successful. After a very encouraging response from the U.S., the Instant Booking feature has been off to a good start in the U.K market. This feature will be, of course, introduced in other markets as well. Right now, its partnership agreement with major hotel chains is yielding strong results. The travel planning site, which earlier this year entered into a partnership with Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), extended its Instant Booking feature arrangement with the world's largest hotel company, Wyndham Hotel Group in October.In the most recent conference call, TripAdvisor's Chief Executive Steve Kaufer highlighted that accelerated roll-out of the Instant Booking feature in the U.S. and U.K boosted revenue approximately by $10 million and EBITDA by $8 million in the quarter ended September 30. This momentum is expected to continue as TRIP brings several partners on-board to its Instant Booking feature, which in turn, should help improve monetization.Moreover, a spate of acquisitions, as I discussed before, in online restaurant table reservation booking business in Europe also should help TRIP in gaining traction in the fast-growing market.TRIP shares now trade at about $77 - well below their 52-week high of $94 and all-time-high of $111. But I think the stock has significant upside given the growth potential. Its TTM price to earnings multiple at 48x is well above the industry average. However, given TRIP's long-term potential, I believe the premium is justified.The only concern I have is the U.S. dollar. The greenback has gained sharply against all major currencies amid increasing possibility of a rate-hike by the Fed before year end. A stronger dollar could hinder TRIP's growth in international markets."
3892656,96196,2016-02-12T13:53:52-05:00,"Management says that they will not forecast revenue or adjusted (Non-GAAP) EBITDA anymore.Management says hotel revenues (91% of total revenues) will be ""muted"" in 2016 and resume growth in 2017.SG&A will keep growing faster than sales as they do what is right for the long-term of the business.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) reported earnings today, the stock was up 12.3%. The value of the put options for the portfolio did not move, we remain in the green.--Few things to note from the earnings call:I had mentioned this in a comment on Seeking Alpha, but not in my actual write-up before the earnings call. I'm going to pick out the parts that matter, but you're welcome to read the entire conversation here (slightly edited this for easy comprehension):I'm saying that gross margins are falling because they are losing pricing power to customers, while they are still aggressively marketing! Profits per user keep falling, while costs per user keep rising! We're going to look at the revenue per hotel shopper metric which management says is what they use to measure how effectively they monetize hotel shoppers. TRIP has no control over this, Partners will always revise their bids, and these Cost Per Clicks (CPC) are going to trend lower over time because everyone is going to try to corner market share by charging lower prices. This ALWAYS happens in perfectly competitive industries. This is from FY 2014 10-K:Start with FY ending 2012:Then FY ending 2013: ""Revenue per hotel shopper decreased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2013 ..""FY Ending 2014 (This increased because of hotel metasearch, which will be a one time benefit):FY 2015 Q1:Take a look at 2015 Q2 and Q3, and you'll see the exact same thing. This number is not just decreasing because of the strong dollar (I agree that the value of the USD does affect them), it is decreasing, because the laws of economics say so! You cannot keep growing costs at a faster rate than revenues in these sort of industries, it's just not sustainable. There are already tons of competitors in china (Ctrip, Qunar merger), who will price them out. Every marketing $1 they spend in China will result in less than $1 in profits.Those were excerpts from a comment I posted on seeking Alpha.Expedia reported Q4/year-end earnings yesterday and I noted that ""Revenue per (hotel) night fell 11%"". Look back to Expedia's Q3, -15%, in Q2, -16%, in Q1, -13.6%. Expedia's management mentioned that only a portion of the decline was aided by the strong dollar. This is what really brought TripAdvisor's CPC growth to a screeching halt (it fell 1% for the quarter, CPC accounts for 60% and hotels account for 91% of Trip's revenues). Priceline and Expedia make up 46% of TripAdvisor's revenues.This is the same phenomenon we see in retail where inventory is rising faster than sales (inventory turnover falling) which precedes the ensuing losses. The difference is that with retail, the losses move from the balance sheet to the income statement, where as we see the decline in the income statement directly in this case. They sell no tangible goods, so the sales and marketing expenses are equivalent to inventory.They mentioned that Hotel growth is going to be ""muted"" for 2016 and will resume growth in 2017, even though the revenue per hotel shopper will grow as a result of the instant booking rollout. And once again, expenses will grow faster than revenues. How sustainable is this? For a new company, brand awareness is important and they will need to spend more $ on sales and marketing expenses. TripAdvisor has been around since 2000, already been in several countries. The reason why SG&A is growing faster than revenues is because the Revenue per hotel shopper is falling. Revenue per hotel shopper is falling because of the price wars coming from upstream (Expedia et al.), and it is only going to go lower in FY 2017 after the effects of the instant booking is worn-in.They also said that they would no longer give revenue or profitability guidance; they basically covered all their bases, and the stock rose. Irrational exuberance's finest. The difference between Priceline, Expedia, and TripAdvisor is that Priceline and Expedia have P/E ratios of 21 and 17, while TripAdvisor sits at 40. The only way I see this short going wrong is if the company gets acquired by dumb money. Priceline owns Kayak, and Expedia actually spun-off TripAdvisor, so I don't necessarily see either of them acquiring the company. Nonetheless, the risk of acquisition is the only reason I'm not doubling down as there is a lot of dumb money floating around internet stocks. The puts will remain 1% of the portfolio. Puts are January 2018, $40. I short over the long term and not quarter/quarter for today's very reason."

For the first nine months of 2015, the company clocked in revenues of $1.2 billion, reflecting 23% growth. TripAdvisor's average monthly unique visitors increased by 24% to 314 million during the same period. The company's tryst with restaurant reservation continued in 2015 with a host of acquisitions. The company's tours and entertainment platform, Viator, witnessed huge growth. However, Instant Booking was the show stealer. Not only did Instant Booking bring in 7 of the top 10 global hotel chains on its platform, but recently, it also got the backing of the global OTA leader, Priceline (PCLN). With all its segments displaying healthy growth on the back of organic growth, strategic investments, and alliances, we believe that not only will TripAdvisor end 2015 on a strong footing, but will also continue 2016 along the same line.Our price estimate of $80 for TripAdvisor is slightly lower than the current market price.Instant Booking Is Going PlacesTripAdvisor's Instant Booking platform, introduced in the first half of 2014, had been gradually expanding after an initial lukewarm response. 7 out of the top 10 global hotel chains are present on the platform, currently. Chains such as Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) have entered into exclusive agreements with TripAdvisor where some of its rooms can only be booked through Instant Booking. Instant Booking's competitive advantage was the lower commission that TripAdvisor charges, which is almost half of what its OTA peers such as Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) or Priceline charge.The biggest milestone for Instant Booking in 2015 was the participation of Priceline's Booking.com. Both Priceline and Expedia had erstwhile shown reluctance towards the platform, as the branding exposure for these companies was limited in the beginning. Also, Instant Booking assists in completing all the steps of the travel booking process, and users are not directed to the OTAs for the final booking completion step. Consequently, OTAs lose out on the chance to build a loyal customer base. Hence, Instant Booking acts like a direct competitor for OTAs. However, Priceline is said to have received exclusive privileges and branding opportunities, before agreeing to the deal. In case the returns on investments are worthwhile, Priceline's other websites might also participate on Instant Booking in the future. Big names such as the InterContinental Hotels Group (NYSE:IHG), Hilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT), and Starwood (NYSE:STWD) will feature on TripAdvisor after the participation of Booking.com. The total number of hotel properties on TripAdvisor after the Booking.com integration is expected to be around 436,000. Finally, Priceline's support was important for TripAdvisor as almost 50% of TripAdvisor's revenues in 2014, were contributed by Priceline and Expedia.Along with the increased inventory base, Booking.com will provide TripAdvisor with added features which might increase the latter's international appeal, such as rich content in non-English languages, competitive rates, and the ability of users to book hotels through local currency or credit cards. Hence, TripAdvisor is currently planning an early global rollout of the Instant Booking platform.TripAdvisor's 'Fancy Dining Experiences' With TheForkOver the last few quarters, TripAdvisor acquired multiple restaurant reservation websites, namely LaFourchette, the leading online restaurant reservation website in France and Spain, MyTable and RestOpolis in Italy, IENS in The Netherlands, Portugal-based Best Tables, and Australia's largest restaurant booking website, Dimmi. Currently, its restaurant booking business spreads over 12 countries, which was achieved in less than a year's time. TripAdvisor has been re-branding its restaurant platform as TheFork, which caters to reservations in over 28,000 restaurants.In September, Priceline acquired Australia-based restaurant booking site, AS Digital, with an aim to expand its own restaurant booking site, OpenTable, into the international arena. OpenTable currently holds the leadership position in North America with around 50% market share in the region. Priceline's international expeditions might provide tough competition to TheFork in the future.Viator's Successful Tourism VenturesTripAdvisor launched a tourism and entertainment related supplier platform called Marketplace in February with the help of its 2014 acquisition, Viator - an online service provider of over 20,000 tours and attractions. Marketplace helps more suppliers list their entertainment-related businesses on TripAdvisor's platform, and also facilitates the user's booking process. As a result of the enhanced features, in Q2 2015, Viator's listing of attractions almost doubled, as compared to all of 2014.Disclosure: No positions."
3958092,96696,2016-03-14T03:36:56-04:00,The duopoly of Expedia and Priceline will use TripAdvisor as a partner to expand their moat and to protect their margins.Excellent value proposition for travellers and hoteliers should allow the firm to grow among changing market dynamics.Reasonable valuation to enter given the intrinsic strengths shown by the firm within the current market scenario.,"TripAdvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) allows travelers to research and plan their trip, compare the prices for travel and lodging accommodations and eventually make booking. The entire process is now completed seamlessly at a single portal and travelers do not need to move from one site to another. Starting as a pure review site, it has grown into quite a strong force within the travelling community for comprehensive reviews and ease of use. Currently, the site attracts 350 million monthly unique visits, has 320 million reviews and opinions, lists 1.8 million accommodation and 3.8 million restaurants.The online travel agency (or OTA) market is concentrated in the hands of two players: Expedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline Group Inc. (PCLN). Close to 95% of the total market is now cornered by these two players. TRIP occupies a distinct corner in this industry where travellers use it for first-hand information about the property which makes it indispensable for the other two major players. When Expedia wanted to acquire Orbitz (another OTA with 15% of market share) last year, it was able to get the necessary permissions from the regulator only because they saw TRIP with its Instant Booking feature as a budding competitor within this industry.Current Tug of war in OTA industryThe obvious result of this duopoly is the higher commissions which hoteliers have to pay to EXPE and PCLN for every booking made on their platform. Any additional player would push commission rates lower thus putting additional pressure on these two firms.The bigger challenge to this duopoly is not TRIP itself, but other tech giants who might like to gain a piece of this lucrative pie. The top of the list is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). A close following of its activities in the travel space shows it is very interested to gain a strong foothold in this market. The recent feature added is Destinations on Google. This will integrate data from Google Flight and Hotel Search to provide single platform for making all travel decisions.Fig: Google destinations integrating various features to one platformAlphabet might be a long way from becoming the ""to go"" platform for travel purchases but it has the requisite resources to make some big ticket purchases. It seems that one of the reasons behind Priceline's deal with TRIP to show its hotel inventory on Instant Booking platform of TripAdvisor was to prevent any takeover or collaboration initiative by Alphabet or other tech firms with TRIP. This ""protecting the flanks"" strategy by PCLN helped TRIP by boosting its shares 26% in a single day.Similar initiatives in the travel space are seen by other firms like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Although ""Amazon Destinations"" platform was closed within half a year in 2015, we can be sure that Jeff Bezos will try something new in this sector.When newer players are trying to gain a foothold, it is generally the smaller firms which are at an advantage. TRIP can benefit by other collaborative deals with Expedia and Priceline who are trying to protect their market share. It can also benefit immensely if Alphabet or Amazon wishes to make a much more concerted effort in this space and use its platform to reach a wider audience quickly.Good value proposition for all partiesThe past few years have seen an increasing use of online reviews by travellers to make the final decisions on travel plans and to filter out any bad apples. TRIP itself has seen a massive surge in the number of reviews on its platform.Fig: Higher monthly unique users and reviews on TRIPAt the same time, it helps hoteliers get real-time information about the requirements of their customers and fill in any gaps in their service.Reasonable valuationConsidering the strengths and growth possibilities of TRIP the current valuation seems reasonable. It is trading at a lower PS ratio of 5.9 than PCLN (7.2) and Ctrip (CTRP) (7.7).Fig: PS ratio of TRIP, PCLN and CTRP.Its revenue has grown from $763 million in 2012 to $1,492 million in 2015 giving 25% CAGR. It has eight of the top 10 hotels on its Instant Booking platform. This ensures that even if the relationship with Priceline goes sour, it can still fall back on good enough inventory of top hotels. Its aggressive purchases like Viator, LaFourchette, VacationHomeRentals.com have also helped the firm diverse out into other areas and should build sustainable revenue stream in the future.ConclusionTripAdvisor has developed a niche place for itself within the travel industry. It has become an attractive partner for other OTAs and hotel chains. This positioning is the biggest moat for the firm and should provide favorable deal making possibilities in the future. These deals will eventually help in increasing the audience reach, brand recognition and help in providing long-term upward momentum to the stock. The current entry point is quite reasonable and we should see its stock hitting $100 mark within 12-24 months."
3581456,67313,2015-10-19T07:41:19-04:00,PCLN and TRIP partnership on Instant Booking is a win-win deal for both parties.PCLN may have secured a better take-rate while TRIP can promote its booking product.Tighter integration could result in TRIP being a takeout candidate in the long run.,"Priceline (PCLN) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) entered into an agreement last week in which PCLN's hotel inventory will be integrated into TRIP's Instant Booking platform. PCLN's Bookings.com will be the first brand to be integrated into TRIP, with Pricline.com and Agoda potentially to follow suit in the coming quarters. After combing through the details and the potential implications, it is evident that both PCLN and TRIP will benefit from the synergy associated with PCLN's hotel inventories and TRIP's user review site.For PCLN, this partnership could generate higher booking and take-rate for its hotel inventories. In addition, having a consumer-facing distribution platform such as a user review site is particularly important to drive traffic and brand awareness. As for TRIP, standing on the shoulders of PCLN is a major positive when it comes to expanding Instant Booking's adoption. The long-term implication is the transition towards more of an O2O business model similar to that of Meituan-Dianping in online travel, restaurants, entertainment and so forth. With increased integration between PCLN and TRIP, I would not be surprised to see PCLN make a bid for TRIP similar to how PCLN made a bid for Kayak several years ago. I remain bullish on both PCLN and TRIP on the back of this partnership.Implications for PCLNPCLN was initially negative on Instant Booking when the service was launched but the change of heart suggests that PCLN may not be willing to sign up for Instant Booking if it had not agreed upon a higher take-rate. The current take-rate for PCLN to operate on the TRIP platform is between 10-15%. I suspect that PCLN secured a lower take-rate which will likely lead to improved profitability in the medium term.Besides the more attractive take-rate, having exposure to a consumer-facing brand is equally important and TRIP will make sure that consumers are aware the underlying engine powering Instant Booking is from PCLN. Additionally, after-sales customer support will be handled by Bookings.com rather than TRIP that further increases the brand profile for PCLN. Over time, this will likely accumulate strong brand awareness and loyalty for PCLN.Implications for TRIPNear-term adoption for Instant Booking is the immediate benefit for TRIP. With better coverage and visibility in front of the consumers, there is a good chance that the consumers will shift their booking habits away from online travel agencies to booking sites due to the convenience factor. Worth noting, it is a natural course of action for users to read the reviews and transact on the site rather than going to another site. Instant Booking makes this a reality but it will take some time for users to change their habits, in my view.While I believe Instant Booking is a great product, several risks remain: First, monetization of Instant Booking and the conventional CPC model remains unclear, and the near-term conversion rate may be low so monetization may not be meaningful. Second, the partnership with PCLN does not address the revenue concentration TRIP faces given that PCLN and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) accounts for almost half of the revenue.With increased concentration and reliance on PCLN, TRIP is positioning itself to be a takeout candidate as PCLN looks to integrate all of its services onto a single platform. I remain bullish on both PCLN and TRIP."

I'm not a fan of shorting amidst volatility since I short with put options. The price has fallen from $85 at the beginning of the year to $63 today for no fundamental reason. It has simply been the result of the Chinese slowdown and low oil prices. Nevertheless, I feel that at $63, the stock is still overpriced.Business ModelTripAdvisor, Inc (NASDAQ:TRIP) is a website that provides reviews of travel related content. The reviews are posted by its users and are accessible to anyone. TripAdvisor operates under two segments:TripAdvisor generates revenue through the following channels:TripAdvisor has grown revenues at a staggering CAGR of 17.8% since 2012 (chart 2). Trailing twelve revenues for 2015 sit at $1.47 billion.(Chart 2) TripAdvisor RevenuesThe company reported net income of $226 million for the fiscal year ended 2014, and so far (TTM), $231 million.Why Short Such A Great Growth Story?Margin Compression Amidst CompetitionRevenue growth numbers only tell one part of the story - the other side is the gross and operating margin compression trend.(Chart 3) TripAdvisor's Gross and Operating MarginsOperating margins have been hit, falling from 50% in March 2011 to the 20s as of September 2015 as a result of rapidly growing SG&A expenses. Falling gross margins from 98.5% in March 2011 to 96.14% in September 2015 indicate pricing power erosion as a result of growing competition (Google Hotel Finder, Bing Travel, Yahoo Travel, Airbnb, Yelp, etc.) in a moat-less industry. For Google and Bing, this is just another feature for their users, but for TripAdvisor, it's 91% of their revenues. Also, Expedia and Priceline accounted for 46% of the total revenues for Fiscal 2014. Because they account for such a large percentage of Trip's revenues, they get the better end of the stick at the negotiation table. Unlike other industries where brand power is significant, customers of the online/travel industry only care about who can provide the goods or services at the lowest possible price, and they will shop around until they find it. This ensues a price war between travel sites like Priceline and Expedia, and airlines which in turn place pricing pressures on referrers like TripAdvisor. Even Lafourchette, TripAdvisor's restaurant booking segment in Europe, will inevitably face price wars.(Chart 4) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses as a percent of SalesAs I mentioned earlier, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses have been growing faster than revenues since the company went public, specifically marketing expenses. The company was founded in 2000, and 16 years later, we have SG&A growing faster than revenues. Obviously, at some point, SG&A bottomed and then started rising against revenues. It speaks volumes about TripAdvisor's eroding pricing power and position in the industry. Though the online travel industry is still in a growth phase, competitors are flocking in by day and night. This means that over the long term, TripAdvisor's gross, operating and profit margins are going to keep falling. This does not bode well for a company with a P/E ratio of 40.MOBILE ISSUESManagement praises the growth in mobile users, then reiterates that it's bad for business.50% of TripAdvisor's traffic was via tablet in 2014 and growing at 60%... but then in the Risk Factors section...later on..As management mentioned, mobile devices accounted for 50% of fiscal year 2014's traffic and grew 60% year over year. If mobile shoppers exhibit a lower rate of conversion and monetize at a significantly lower rate than desktop users, then where is this business headed?SHORT STRATEGYI bought the January 2018 $40 put options for $3.90 this morning (2/4/2015). Trip reports earnings next week, I'm not a fan of speculating quarter over quarter on what earnings will be, but I do know that over two years, margins and profitability should fall."
3593496,88786,2015-10-22T12:03:57-04:00,"TripAdvisor has announced a strategic partnership with Priceline and thus, has increased its catalogue of rental properties.By initiating this partnership, TripAdvisor will be able to better serve users and at the same time enlarge and strengthen its ecosystem.Expedia and other similar sites may have to step up their game and look for a partnership or TripAdvisor may just run them over.I remain confident that this company will reward shareholders over the long term as it continues to lay the pathway for further expansion and growth.","IntroductionLast Wednesday, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP) announced a partnership with rival Priceline Group (NASDAQ: PCLN) that will bring some of Priceline's online travel brand onto TripAdvisor's booking platform. Priceline has roughly 600,000 hotels rooms and vacation rental properties that are listed on its travel-booking site, bookings.com. If the partnership will allow those rooms to be featured on TripAdvisor's platform as well, it will only increase the competitive edge for the latter while reducing the amount of competition between the two travel giants.TripAdvisor launched its booking initiative in June last year and it was a huge success. It enables users to book hotel rooms directly on its site or app without shifting customers to Priceline or Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE). Customers who want to research, book or plan a trip are given all the essential tools they need under one roof. By having that feature, TripAdvisor was able to not only build a brand which is known for creating tons of customer value but also an economic moat that other companies will find hard to duplicate. Customers aren't the only ones getting a kick out of this move.TripAdvisor partnered with Marriott International (NASDAQ: MAR) and Hyatt Hotels (NYSE: H) to list their properties on its site. With roughly more than 235,000 properties that have been made available on TripAdvisor's platform, its partnership with Priceline will take it to a whole new level.Building a Strong Economic MoatLast year, almost half of TripAdvisor's revenue came from Priceline and Expedia. So while the partnership looks like a good move, it's also a very tricky one because TripAdvisor is very likely biting the hand that is feeding it. With its most recent partnership with Priceline, TripAdvisor is yet again treading on a very thin line. Although it has not stepped over it yet, I think investors can tell TripAdvisor is certainly dancing very vigorously on it. In fact, this strategic move has made it very clear that TripAdvisor isn't playing out when it says that it wants to become a dominant player in the booing space. Now that TripAdvisor has made a significant step forward, companies like Expedia may start to feel the heat. With Priceline on board with the partnership, Expedia may have to make its move very soon if it doesn't want to be left out.Both CEOs of Priceline (Darren Houston) and TripAdvisor (Stephen Kaufer) have expressed their excitement over their partnership. Kaufer has mentioned that the partnership has been a huge victory for TripAdvisor as this is the first partnership with a global travel agency partner. As of now, it feels like the marriage between both companies have a great start. The problem may arise when TripAdvisor starts to pull away customers from Priceline's direct site and onto its own. Still, if the partnership goes well, I think both companies stand to gain in the long run.TripAdvisor has been developing an ecosystem where users can get a tremendous amount of value through the reviews of other travelers and the rating system. The platform isn't only holistic for a complete travel experience but also friendly to use.ConclusionOne of the biggest worries that investors of TripAdvisor have is the onslaught of competition that Priceline might bring to the table. With the new strategic partnership, that risk has been significantly diminished while TripAdvisor's economic moat has been made even stronger. To see that both companies are now partners rather than competitors will probably bring much comfort to investors from both camps. With the growth of TripAdvisor's booking network, I would be anticipating a similar move from Expedia to collaborate.Previously, I've written how TripAdvisor's share price looked very attractive. On the morning that news of the partnership was announced, TripAdvisor's share price shot up by more than 20% during pre-market trading. Even after the price went up significantly, I still think that there's so much room to grow considering the opportunities ahead. I remain confident that this company will reward shareholders over the long term as it continues to lay the pathway for further expansion and growth."
3440606,88786,2015-08-14T11:31:42-04:00,"Shares of TripAdvisor plunged after they announced earnings.Financials were not as warm and toasty as investors would like them to be.As new initiatives and partnerships with hotel chains play out, this company stands a chance to grow tremendously for years to come.The price plunge is unwarranted and the opportunity to buy is now.","IntroductionIn my previous article here, I stated my views on how I expected TripAdvisor's (NASDAQ:TRIP) second quarter earnings will turn out. Needless to say, the results were not in line with my expectations. The question that lingers now is ""should I be worried that I don't have it figured out at all?' As a long-term investor, I remain confident that this business will thrive in the coming years.With the travel industry picking up some steam as the economy heads towards a slow and steady recovery, TripAdvisor wasted little time when it came to capitalizing on its opportunities. After the earnings on Thursday, investors were left thinking if this company is able to raise its profits or not.Financial ResultsTripAdvisor once again disappointed investors on the bottom line and like every other company which collects revenue from outside of the U.S., the influence of foreign exchange headwinds proved to be a hindrance to this business.For the second quarter, total revenue rose by 25% to $405 million. Anyone would agree with me that the double figure growth rate is pretty stellar. However, investors and analysts were not thrilled to see come up short by 3%. GAAP net income fell by 15% from 2014 Q2 to $58 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 dropped by a penny from previous year's quarter. Overall, these metrics had fell short of expectations and the stock took a beating the moment the market opened.Every company has been affected by the strong dollar. However, it was a bigger deal for TripAdvisor. If these headwinds were excluded, the company stated that revenue improved by at least 35% year-on-year. The impact that it had on adjusted earnings was shocking. If the company was to take into account foreign exchange headwinds, it had shown a loss of 5% on the operating margin. Otherwise, it is a 15% profit.Subscription and transaction-based revenue nearly doubled to $99 million, making up nearly 25% of the company's total sales. Click-based advertising, which is responsible for bagging two-thirds of the total sales, rose by 13 and last but not least, display-based ads saw a solid 8% increase.After breaking down sales by market segments, we saw that North American revenue rose 31%. This is great news as this portion of the revenue makes up more than half of TripAdvisor's overall sales. On the same note, Europe's gains only came in at 19% while Asia Pacific grew at a rate of 14%.Is The Price Plunge Warranted?I believe that while numbers are important, investors need to assess the management behind the company. With that said, I feel confident that CEO Steve Kaufer has a huge equity stake in the company and thus, he is motivated to take the company to greater heights.During the call, Kaufer had listed out a couple of milestones that the company had achieved; 250 million reviews and a base of 375 million unique users. As the company continues to collaborate with hotel chains to aid in direct bookings, the company has placed itself in an incredible position that will pave a steady growth in revenue and profits in the future.ConclusionIf one were to take a look at the share price after earnings, it is crystal clear that investors were not thrilled by the results this quarter. One may also claim that the P/E ratio is out of whack. However, with growth potential that is about to play out, I believe that long-term investors would need to stick to their convictions and hang on for the ride."
3448666,49191,2015-08-18T12:31:39-04:00,TripAdvisor is building out a premier travel platform across the desktop and mobile ecosystems.The stock trading in the low 70's presents a terrific entry point based on long-term tailwinds.The market underappreciates the company's opportunity as it rolls out Instant Booking and pursues adjacent businesses.,"OverviewTripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is a leading travel company specializing in travel research before and during the trip across the world. The company has a significant user base in both mobile and desktop sockets with a wide variety of reviews and recommendations for accommodations, restaurants, and attractions. TripAdvisor primarily generates its revenue from click-based advertising on hotels from OTAs (online-travel agencies), 1st party hoteliers, and other suppliers. TripAdvisor is rapidly expanding into other areas as well including, restaurants, attractions, and vacation rentals, and instant booking directly on TripAdvisor.At 5.6x forward sales, TripAdvisor is significantly undervalued by the market given the company's high value of revenue and long-run growth rate. TripAdvisor has a strong competitive position which will allow to grow substantially above market in hotels, and additionally TripAdvisor has the ability to develop adjacent transactional revenue opportunities in attractions and restaurants through the development of its platform.While there is near-term pressure on international hotel CPC's, there is significant opportunity through the roll out of Instant Booking to improve user conversion especially on the mobile platform. In addition the companies CPC's will benefit from a long-term shift to meta-search and commoditization of OTAs.Driving Usage - User Base & Content HealthTripAdvisor's primary competitive advantage is the company's user base and content. No other OTA has the scale and benefits of the network effect of TripAdvisor, and replicating TripAdvisor's breadth of content would be nearly impossible. More users feeds more conent, which in turn drives more users. With all of this content TripAdvisor is building a travel platform which is unrivaled, in terms of user engagement and customer value.The trend in Monthly Unique Visitors is strong and accelerating growth to 35% Y/Y to over 350M users. Bringing users into its ecosystem is highly important, both in driving hotel shoppers and users into other key initiatives. Overall users continue to grow faster than hotel shoppers (35% compared to 22%) as the company drives traffic to other content on the site. Management has cited that roughly 50% of users do not visit the hotel pages at all, emphasizing the opportunity TRIP has in monetizing these users.Source: Company Earnings ReleasesIn addition to user growth engagement remains robust with 50% growth of reviews to a cumulative total of 250M.Source: Company Earnings ReleasesRevenue growth despite headwinds remains strong. At 96% GM and sustainable organic traffic, this is high quality revenue with a substantial long-term margin profile.Source: SEC Filings and internal estimatesHotel Segment:TripAdvisor's Hotel segment is positioned to achieve above market growth due to its unrivaled inventory, positive trends in meta-search, and customer friendly improvements such as Instant Booking.In Q2 Revenue per Hotel Shopper was impacted by higher than anticipated weakness in international markets. I view this as a short-term trend, partially driven by currency and some macro softness in the auction house. In light of the Instant Booking rollout visibility to growth in CPC and conversion rates, will be a key area of focus over the next couple of quarters.Source: SEC FilingsTripAdvisor has an unrivaled inventory as positioned as a meta-search provider. In addition TRIP has a substantial underutilized inventory in Vacation Rentals of over 720,000. With the large number of listings, TRIP can add hotels to its Instant Booking platform while still offering meta-search on other properties in a comprehensive consumer friendly way. This allows TripAdvisor to build its Instant Booking inventory and itself as a pseudo OTA without having to start from scratch building inventory.Source: Company Filings, Expedia, and Priceline, Booking.com includes 262,000 of vacation rentals.Meta search for travel engines will be the primary factor driving a commoditization of OTAs. Even with the consolidation of OTAs, meta-search places control in the hands of the consumer, and will continually diminish the power of the OTA brand.OTA's will aggressively pursue to acquire and keep customers. As the companies increasingly compete, customer acquisition spend will outpace revenue through both offline means and TAC through Google/meta-search providers. In aggregate, this trend is likely to be a net negative for Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), although both have strong meta-brands as well (Kayak and Trivago).The OTA industry has experienced and likely will continue to experience consolidation into the two dominant players, Priceline and Expedia. Consolidation presents the opportunity for platform cost savings across properties from scaling technology and G&A functions. A risk of consolidation is that bidding becomes less competitive at TRIP's auction house, however entities within Priceline tend to operate independently. Also, as TripAdvisor drives a higher mix of transactional hotel instant booking, this reduces the risk of less competitive bidding on the auction house.Other Segment:Comprised of three separate businesses: vacation rentals, restaurants, and attractions.As a whole the opportunity of these businesses are substantially underappreciated by the market. In my view the valuation of this segment is weighed down by visibility into the organic trajectory of newly acquired businesses, and concerns over the level spend required to build out these businesses.The organic growth in the segment is tough to break-out, due to the number of acquisitions the company has been integrating into its platform. TRIP has been rapidly acquiring complementary businesses in attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals at reasonable prices (~5x sales) over the past year and half.Q2's results were very strong growing 44% Q/Q and 210% Y/Y. By my estimates the vacation rental business is growing triple digits on a pure organic basis, and La Fourchette and Viator are (by my estimates) roughly 75% larger than when they were acquired less than a year ago. Both business are still small, but have the ability to scale quickly with TripAdvisor.Source: Company Filings and Internal EstimatesAs the company laps its acquisitions and fully integrates these businesses, the market may be willing to attach a higher multiple to this stream. In the long-term, this revenue stream is highly attractive market opportunity with scalable economics. TripAdvisor already has the platform size and loyal user base, it simply needs to bring the suppliers into its ecosystem and reshapes its user's behavior.AttractionsTripAdvisor's Attractions business is comprised of its acquisition of Viator completed in Q3 of FY14. In my view attractions has the potential to be the largest opportunity of these three investment areas. Viator principally provides bookable tours on TripAdvisor. This is just a small piece of the opportunity in total, which the company is pursuing in the short-term. Tours providers are extremely fragmented with low entry barriers, allowing for TRIP to capture strong booking margins by driving important volume. Additionally users becoming more engaged on their smartphones during trips will drive growth potential in booking attractions online.In the long-run Trip has the potential to become the premier OTA for attractions. Moving beyond tours will be key by adding world class attractions to its platform (Colleseum, Louvre, etc...). An OTA for attractions has the ability to reduce friction in the ticket purchasing process, and reduce overhead for attraction operators. TripAdvisor is in the best position to create and capitalize on this opportunity, driven by its user base, existing content (travel guides and listings), and first mover advantage.To the attraction suppliers TripAdvisor is able to offer its user base, favorability in listing positions, and a technological solution to reduce costs.Source: Company Earnings ReleasesRestaurantsTripAdvisor's Restaurant business is comprised of its acquisition of La Fourchette also branded as The Fork in English. TripAdvisor has been adding additional regions through acquisitions. In my mind this is a good strategy as the most important factor for this business is to add Trip's inventory and regional coverage. Furthermore Trip's platform with reviews on 3 million restaurants overall allows for the company to easily plug-in new supply to its user base.Source: Company Earnings ReleasesCurrently La Fourchette has significant coverage in France, and Spain with expanding coverage, this is made up of 7,000+ restaurants in France (Source: La Fourchette's website) and 24,000+ in total across all bookable sources (source Q2FY15 earnings presentation). With a significant presence in Paris and Spain, TripAdvisor is well set-up to expose this platform in some of Europe's top travel destinations.While TRIP has a lot of work to continue to build out its bookable inventory, the company has an incredible coverage of restaurant listings. Anecdotally the TripAdvisor brand is very prominent in Europe. Many restaurants prominently place their TripAdvisor review cards in their window. To help build its supply, TRIP can offer restaurants with bookable properties a priority placement on its website. This is a powerful lever to incentivize restaurants to join the platform, as a driver of foot traffic as well as through the web portal. In the coming year's La Fourchette will have to compete intensely in international markets with Priceline's larger Open Table.Vacation Rentals: TripAdvisor's vacation rental business has quickly built-up inventory and shifted its supply toward a transaction system. The inventory remains substantially underutilized, and there is significant opportunity to continue to capture and draw users to its vacation rental business.Listings are substantial, but in many cases review counts remain low. Similar to its hotel business it is important management is able to build-out content and reviews for these properties. User reviews remain extremely low in many destination cities, so the buildout of these pilot users is imperative to drive substantial user bookings. TripAdvisor has the ability to drive traffic to rentals through its hotel channel, however management should be careful managing the two streams together.Source: Company Earnings ReleasesValuationTripAdvisor trades at a highly attractive valuation given its growth profile and revenue. On a forward basis the company trades at 30x earnings and 5.5x sales. While this represents a premium to the market, I believe it is deserved given the above average growth rate of online travel sector, and scalable economics.I am modeling over the next 10 years, the company's operating margin to expand with revenue growth as scale and investments payoff. I am modeling operating margins to expand from 23% in FY15 to over 50%.Looking at TripAdvisor's peers I fail to see how the company does not trade closer to new tech internet peers. Positioned at the top of the marketing funnel, Google and Facebook may actually be a proper comp for TripAdvisor's hotel advertising business. This core business I believe should fetch ~8-10x revenues which represent a premium to Google (due to higher gross margins) and a discount to Facebook (due to lower mobile monetization).Using OTA's as a EV/Sales comp is misleading as these companies have significantly higher variable customer acquisition costs in the long-run. Even as TRIP converts more customer's via Instant Booking, the company deserves a substantial premium to traditional OTA's as it is able to organically drive volume to its website due to the strength of its content.In addition, the company's other segment deserves to trade at a premium to overall company due to its higher growth potential and mobile transactional mix. The two best private comps are AirBnB and Uber. I believe comparing the other segment to these private start-ups is fair, given that they both operate transactional business models, with a high mix of mobile on-demand attractions. With recent equity raises valuing the companies at $25 and $50 billion respectively. This suggests that there is substantial room for the market to richly value this segment. Although these companies' financials are not made public, it is likely that these raises are at 20x+ sales. Trip's other segment deserves to trade at a discount to that multiple, since it is not the clear number one supplier, and current lack of scale.Combining these two segments at 8-10x sales for hotels and 12-15x for other yields a valuation range of $110-$135 per share. This represents upside of 51-89% from today's prices. I believe that TripAdvisor has the ability with its growth to capture this valuation gap over the next 3-5 years, plus its yearly expected return.Appendix A: Income StatementAppendix B: Balance Sheet"
3363945,63203,2015-07-29T11:27:25-04:00,"TripAdvisor has been a great investment over the past years.However, the growth is already priced into the stock.Shares are still overvalued by around 20% with high growth and margin assumptions.Investors should wait for better entry points.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has been a great investment since its spinoff from Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) in late 2011. The stock has almost tripled since then against an 84% increase in the S&P 500. Following its recent earnings announcement, the stock took a dive due to a slowdown in its growth rate. However, at 56 times trailing earnings, it continues to be richly valued. In this article, I attempt to evaluate if the pullback presents a buying opportunity.SPY data by YChartsPerformance summaryTripAdvisor has three main revenue streams, the largest being click-based advertising, which accounted for $870M, or 70% of revenue in 2014. Display-based advertising was $140M and 11% of revenue, while subscription and other revenue accounted for $236M or 19%. Total net sales were $1.246B and grew 32% Y/Y. Although sales have grown 63% from 2013 to 2015, net income has grown only 16% over the same period as the company has ploughed back earnings into sales and marketing and R&D expenses. S&M expenses make up a whopping 40% of sales, while R&D is at 14%.KPIs and DriversFor the click-based advertising business, the key drivers of growth are site visitors and monetization (revenue per visitor). TRIP has been doing a great job of attracting visitors to its properties, as visitor growth was 35% in 2013 and 17% in 2014. For the current fiscal year, visitor growth has been around 25%. Monetization growth has been more patchy, at -13% in 2013 and +7% in 2014. For the current year, revenue per visitor will be flat to negative single digits, driven by the FX impact as well as expansion in new markets which monetize at a lower rate.For the display-based advertising business, the key drivers are the number of impressions and the cost per impression (similar in concept to the click-based advertising business). In 2013, display impressions grew 34% while 2014 growth was 19%. In 2015, impressions growth has been lower at around 12%. CPM growth was -5% in 2013 and -1% in 2014. In 2015, CPM also is expected to be roughly flat to 2014 levels.Valuation assumptionsTo value TRIP, the key assumptions are around visitor growth and monetization growth for the click-based and display advertising businesses as well as the level of S&M investments that the company will need to make to sustain revenue growth. I am assuming that visitor growth and impressions will continue their healthy growth trajectory in the 20% range, but monetization will slow down and be relatively flat to low single digit growth. I also assume that the company will reduce its marketing expenses as a percentage of sales from 40% to 35% over time. R&D expenses are forecasted to be flat at 14% of sales, while I'm also assuming G&A efficiencies over time, from 10% to 8% of sales.With these assumptions and using a discount rate of 10% and a terminal value growth rate of 4%, I get a fair market value of $68 for TRIP. This is a 17% discount to today's prices, suggesting that TRIP is still overvalued even under pretty aggressive growth assumptions. The complete valuation model is attached below.ConclusionTRIP is undoubtedly the largest player in the online travel review space and has leveraged that competitive position to grow its business over the last couple of years. The company has years of growth ahead of it and multiple growth opportunities (as evidenced by its entry into the restaurant review space). However, the growth appears to be already priced in and assumes a significant growth in operating margins. As a result, I would not recommend investing in TRIP at these prices. It is a high quality company and deserves a premium valuation, but I'd wait for a more opportune buying moment before jumping in."
3359685,32711,2015-07-27T10:58:14-04:00,TripAdvisor is increasingly moving towards the role of an OTA.Q2 earnings indeed showed the contribution of transaction revenue soar.The fact that it is increasingly competing with its two main customers could pressure ad revenue as they adjust their strategy.The company needs to see a higher contribution from Instant Booking soon.,"TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is currently in the midst of an important transition. Originally conceived as a review site, largely dependent on advertising revenue, the rollout of the Instant Booking feature is putting it on course to become more of a traditional OTA. This increasingly puts TripAdvisor in competition with its two largest advertising partners, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN), that have so far declined to participate in the booking program. Additionally, these OTAs may dial back their advertising spend on TripAdvisor, meaning it will be increasingly reliant on these transactions.Booking gains tractionTripAdvisor's Q2 report, which was a disappointment to investors and led to a severe selloff, was largely a story of currency. Currency swings not only affected the translation of revenue, but also put pressure on ad pricing outside the US and the purchasing power of many international customers. In June and into July, European ad pricing especially slowed down. This decline in international CPC prompted a significant slash in guidance for the rest of the year.The report also showed how the company's efforts to transition into a more OTA-like model affected revenue contributions. Click-based ad revenue, traditionally the company's bread and butter, saw its contribution fall to 66% of overall revenue compared to 73% in the same period a year ago, despite rising 13% year-over-year including currency effects. Meanwhile, subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes Instant Booking revenue, saw its contribution soar to 24% of overall revenue compared to 16% last year, with year-over-year growth accelerating to 94%.Transaction revenue is likely to become an increasingly important revenue growth driver over the next few years. According to CEO Stephan Kaufer, the company expects ""the hotel space to migrate towards transaction, but where I see vacation rentals being in the future, I would expect it to be almost all transaction oriented.""TripAdvisor's dedication to this commission-based model is also translating into a considerably higher marketing spend, which presumably contributed to Q2's earnings miss and decline. For the period, the company invested $20 million in TV advertising, contributing to an 800 basis point year-over-year S&M deleveraging, as it is keen to get the word out on its booking services. For the year, the advertising budget has roughly doubled from around $30 million to $60 million.However, now that it is increasingly in competition with its major advertising customers, it really needs booking revenue to take off.Biting the hand that feeds?TripAdvisor's Q1 2014 announcement that it was entering the realm of OTAs is unlikely to have been met with glee on the part of Priceline and Expedia, the two major players in the industry. This wouldn't be too much of a problem if not for the fact that these companies are TripAdvisor's two biggest advertising customers. Although their contribution has been falling over the last few years, they were still good for 46% of revenue last year.The fact that customers can book directly through TripAdvisor is likely to reduce traffic to Expedia and Priceline, who are in turn likely to dial back advertising spending as it is becoming less effective. Moreover, both have metasearch sites of their own. Understandably, they also declined to participate in the program, which limits its inventory and consequently its appeal to consumers.TripAdvisor has been adding a good deal of inventory of its own, though. Some 235,000 hotels can now be booked directly, and in Q2, it signed Marriott, adding another 4,200 properties and 19 brands globally. The acceleration in transaction revenue moreover suggests that the UBS estimate of 2016 revenue contribution from Instant Booking of 30% may well be surpassed.At the moment, the decline in TripAdvisor ad spending by Priceline and Expedia may be limited by the fact that they still regard it as an important source of traffic. However, the likelihood of an adjustment to their views regarding TripAdvisor over the next few years combined with the company's soaring advertising and marketing spend means that TripAdvisor needs its risky bet on booking to pay off sooner rather than later.So far, the company seems to be on the right track in terms of bookings growth, and higher marketing spend and the signing of Marriott should boost sales going forward.ConclusionTripAdvisor's Q2 report showed how accelerating growth in Instant Booking is boosting its contribution to overall revenue, while increased advertising spends to promote the service ate into the bottom line. Yet, its foray into booking is in time likely to lead to decreased advertising spend from its two largest customers, Priceline and Expedia, as it increasingly becomes a competitor as well as an advertising partner. Although it is on the right track in terms of growth, it will need to see a significant bottom line contribution from Instant Booking fairly soon."
3567146,67313,2015-10-13T18:21:22-04:00,"Ernst Teunissen will join TRIP as its new CFO, starting on November 9th.Teunissen is a qualified candidate with experience in a public tech company and a finance background in banking.The CFO hire should alleviate investor concerns on management roles. Positive for TRIP.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) announced that Ernst Teunissen will join the company as its CFO, starting on November 9th. Teunissen comes from Cimpress NV (NASDAQ:CMPR), formerly known as Vistaprint, where he was its CFO. This move comes after Julie Bradley informed TRIP of her intention to resign from the firm back in April. During the transition, Bradley will remain with TRIP to help Teunissen. Interestingly, Bradley originally intended to leave at the end of September but is extending her stay for an additional two months to smoothen the transitional process.In my view, the hiring of Teunissen is a major positive for TRIP during the company's transformational period. First, the market should be getting more comfortable with the management positions given the increased clarity after several months of evaluation of potential candidates to become the CFO. Second, Teunissen is clearly an experienced CFO who is qualified to manage the financial aspects of the company given his prior background, and I expect the investment community to gradually warm up to his international perspective as TRIP expands overseas.This shift in management comes during perhaps the most important transformational period of the company's history, involving the product development and monetization surrounding Instant Booking. Although I acknowledge that Teunissen may be a less known name for many investors, it is worth pointing out that he does have experience running a public company as a CFO so communicating with the investment community should not be an issue. Also worth noting is that Bradley was in a similar position prior to her joining TRIP since she was at Art Technology Group, a small e-commerce services company. I expect Teunissen to ramp up on TRIP with the help of Bradley in the coming months, and over time, I expect that the investment community will increasingly appreciate Teunissen's expertise in overseas markets given TRIP's focus on diversifying its business outside of the US.Looking at Teunissen's resume, I would argue that he is an experienced CFO having come from Cimpress (Vistaprint) where he was recently an executive VP and CFO. Having been with Cimpress for 5+ years, Teunissen was part of the key decision-making process involving corporate strategy, finance and operations. Prior to Cimpress, Teunissen founded two corporate finance and management consulting firms focusing on asset management solutions. Teunissen started his career at Morgan Stanley's investment banking division, specializing in tech, media and telecom in London, so overall a very qualified candidate for TRIP.Conclusion: Teunissen's hiring is a positive for TRIP as the street will likely see him as a sharper candidate over Bradley, who had several communication mishaps with the investment community. While I believe that Steve Kaufer will remain to be the key decision maker of the company, Teunissen's presence could significantly improve TRIP's managerial capability."

TRIP's net income though was down about 7% due to rising advertising and marketing related costs.Shares, however, more than compensated for a rather weak performance post first quarter earnings release after Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) and TripAdvisor announced on June 17 that they have agreed to extend their partnership, which would allow the international hotel chain to add its hotel portfolio on TripAdvisor's Instant Booking platform. The announcement led to a rally in TRIP shares, which gained as much as 15%. The gains were not surprising as it is a very significant agreement.The service, which should be available later this summer, would allow users to easily complete booking at any of the hotel chain's more than 4,200 worldwide hotels without leaving the TripAdvisor site. The Instant Booking feature, which was introduced in the U.S. in 2014, has been already a huge success as it provides a very convenient booking experience for travelers. In the U.S, around 50% of bookings were completed though mobile phones last year. Extending the partnership with Marriott International would further boost TRIP's user base and revenue.The reason why I have been bullish on TRIP is that ever since the company was spun-off from its parent company Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) in 2011, it has been taking very sound decisions driven by strategic acquisitions and partnerships, which have reinforced its capabilities as a leading online bookings service provider.Still, one might argue about its very high valuation multiples. Its TTM P/E ratio is about 60, which is well above the industry's average.But that should not deter long-term investors. As I discussed earlier, TripAdvisor has made some very good acquisitions in Europe in the recent past such as mytable.it, lens.nl and Lafourchette, which would allow it to expand its footprint in the fast-growing restaurant reservation business. And of course, the APAC region, which still accounts for a little above a tenth of the total revenue, presents huge potential to grow in the long run.Shares now trade at about $91, which is still below its all-time-high of $111. However, there's significant upside in the long term given that TRIP's very successful feature - Instant Bookings - will be rolled-out globally over a period of time.That said, advertising and marketing related costs are expected to remain high as it looks to expand aggressively amid rising competition from online reservation sites such as Kayak and startups like Airbnb. In the fiscal first quarter, TRIP's total cost and expenses jumped to $273 million from $185 million, year-over-year. This fiscal year, its ad-spend budget is estimated at $60 million. So, its bottom line will remain under some pressure. However, given its acquisitions in the recent past, TRIP remains a good-long term bet with more possible upside."
3308355,70385,2015-07-07T11:02:01-04:00,"TripAdvisor has a new partnership with Marriott International to do instant booking for 4,200-plus hotels.Market leaders Priceline and Expedia won't allow TripAdvisor to do instant bookings through their sites.As TripAdvisor grows and becomes more independent, it will become more expensive to compete with the market leaders, and margins could suffer.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has popped up on some of my searches as I look over the market for interesting companies. The most notable move recently was when the company announced an instant booking partnership with Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR). This means TripAdvisor customers can make reservations at 4,200-plus hotels that are within Marriott's hotel portfolio directly and all within TripAdvisor's website.Yet will that and other recent initiatives make TripAdvisor a more attractive stock than its direct competitors, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN)?What may have started out as a travel and hotel review site that referred business onward is turning into its own ""one-stop shop"" travel booking business. I admire the success TripAdvisor has had since listing in late 2011, and the early investors must be ecstatic from the share price tripling from about $30 to as high as $110 within the first three years.But after the initial business expansion, the company has grown big enough to cause friction with market leader Priceline and even Expedia, which spun off TripAdvisor. Both of these companies have declined, letting TripAdvisor perform instant bookings of their hotel offerings, and for good reasons, too.First, the same TripAdvisor services that can help the two big players with their referral business also sends business to their competitors. I would think that Expedia would have spun off the popular TripAdvisor to realize more market value for shareholders, but not to be a source of increasing competition against it. Priceline's stance against TripAdvisor is obvious as well.Second, similar to the Marriott deal where all the bookings are done on TripAdvisor's site, TripAdvisor would grow its reputation as the ""go to"" site for online bookings with all the Expedia and Priceline hotel databases in the background. Customers would do everything on TripAdvisor's site rather than be sent onto the Expedia and Priceline sites. See a problem here? The two big rivals do, and they're not going for it.The online travel reservations business is highly competitive. And for TripAdvisor to maintain its previous double-digit earnings growth it either has to expand its ad revenues or get more involved directly with hotel, flight and tour reservations.The problem is that TripAdvisor must be careful as it tries to develop new income sources separate from what it gets from the two market leaders. ­Looking at the company's revenue by product, you do see a good, rising revenue trend, roughly doubling in the past four years. Excellent.Investors can notice about 80% of the revenue comes from ads, 69% click-based and the other 10% from display. There's nothing wrong with that. That's actually why the company has been as successful as it is. Viewers come for the extensive reviews and holiday ideas, and TripAdvisor gets revenue for ads and referrals. Like many others, I myself have used the site to find interesting locations and good restaurants, and it is helpful because I get the viewpoint of fellow travelers and diners.Source: Tripadvisor Q1 2015 earnings presentationThat said, about 46% of total revenue was generated from Priceline and Expedia business around the end of 2014. That becomes a problem that all business students should recognize - having too much of your revenue coming from but a few clients or businesses. Adding on new revenue sources is what a healthy, growing company needs to do. Still, Priceline and Expedia could put pressure on TripAdvisor and competition can become expensive.My concern is TripAdvisor's profit margins are declining. Looking at the past 4-5 years, revenues are up and earnings are up, yet since 2012 net income margins are trending down. Of course, the company has been making a number of acquisitions during that time, so margins can be affected by investments. It has been trying to keep up with the pace of acquisitions Priceline and Expedia have been making as the industry consolidates more.Source: Data from gurufocus.comThe good thing about TripAdvisor is that the net margins and earnings growth are still good for a young, growing company. Return on equity and invested capital are still at strong levels, but they are moderating.What the company is finding is as the expenses for expansion rise with its success, the return is getting lighter. Analysts may be projecting high earnings growth over the next several years, but more competition, smaller margins and higher running costs may be in the cards as it has to begin fighting more for market share with Expedia and Priceline.I would rather stick with Priceline because I think it is a better performer than TripAdvisor and Expedia. In a highly competitive, discount-oriented industry like online travel reservations, holding the market leaders is better in the long run because of their large economies of scale, durability and strong brand names."

The world's largest travel review company posted revenues to the tune of $1.3 billion in 2014, up by 32% year on year. All of the three divisions posted strong top line growth - click-based advertising revenue grew by 25% year on year to $870 million, display-based advertising increased by 18% year on year to $140 million, and subscription and transaction revenue was up by 82% year on year to $236 million.However, the Instant Booking platform, one of the expected growth drivers, can provide roadblocks on TripAdvisor's growth path. In this article, we explore how Instant Booking can limit TripAdvisor's growth and the possible ramifications.Our price estimate of $87 for TripAdvisor's stock is around a 15% premium to the current market price.TripAdvisor's Advertising Revenues May Be Dampened Due To Instant Booking (~15% Downside)In mid-2013, TripAdvisor launched its meta-search feature that integrated users' search query results on the main page, allowing users to search and compare various options on TripAdvisor. This enhancement allowed users to see hotel pricing options and availability from booking partners on a single page. Until then, users had to visit the advertisers' sites to get such information. TripAdvisor claimed that its ad conversion rates and ROI for advertisers improved significantly post the introduction of this feature. This, in turn, facilitated the company to charge better prices for ads or clicks.In Q1 2014, TripAdvisor rolled out its Instant Booking feature which aimed at reducing the friction related to mobile bookings. Instant Booking allowed users to book hotels on the TripAdvisor platform itself with the ""Book with TripAdvisor"" option, as against visiting the hotel or Online Travel Agency (OTA) website to complete the booking process, after searching for hotels through TripAdvisor (which is TripAdvisor's current model).The Instant Booking feature, which is presently available in beta format in the U.S., allows TripAdvisor's partners, such as: hotel chains, independent hotels, bed and breakfasts, and OTAs, to vie for top spots (through an auction bidding tool) on TripAdvisor's metasearch results.The Instant Booking feature, coupled with meta-search, provides users with end-to-end services starting from listings to the comparison of availability and pricing, to completing their bookings.TripAdvisor's standard meta-search model follows a cost-per-click (CPC) structure where partner hotels bid for each click made by users on the partners' links. Instant Booking, on the other hand, requires partners to pay a commission for each completed transaction. Hence, willing partners bid via an auction for the commission percentage they are ready to pay for completed transactions. The commission based model is similar to most of the OTAs' pricing process of a fee per transaction, charged after the completion of a stay (What TripAdvisor's instant booking means for hotels, tnooz, November 2014).Advantages Of The Instant Booking ModelIn the long run, Instant Booking might help TripAdvisor to provide direct competition to established names such as Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE).How Could The Instant Booking Model Thwart TripAdvisor's Advertising Revenue Growth?This is a unique model in the existing marketplace and hence gaining partners on the platform is taking longer than usual according to management. The company aims to spread the new avatar of TripAdvisor through online and offline channels, through their ""plan, compare, and book"" message. In 2015, the company plans to spend around $60 million towards TV advertisements, in order to spread the message across the globe.The Instant Booking platform is acting as a double-edged sword for TripAdvisor. On the one hand, its functionality gets expanded, on the other hand, the feature puts it in direct competition, with two of its biggest customers in advertising display, i.e., Priceline and Expedia. For December 31, 2014, both these companies individually accounted for over 10% of TripAdvisor's total revenues, and the two companies combined accounted for 46% of its total revenues.Both the OTA giants have chosen not to display their inventories on the Instant Booking platform. Instead, they have chosen to display their inventories on applications that are Instant Booking's direct competitors. And not without valid reasons. The launch of Instant Booking undermines the functionalities of Priceline and Expedia. With Instant Booking, all the steps of the booking process get completed on TripAdvisor's website. However, Instant Booking's success is largely dependent on the inclusion of inventories from the two online travel behemoths.Additionally, for OTAs, Instant Booking might be less valuable than TripAdvisor's meta-search option because these companies want to attract customers to their own websites, in order to eventually convert users to direct bookers from their own websites. This would generate direct business from their brands in the future. The ""Book with TripAdvisor"" facility erodes the brand recall of the OTAs for users, as they can already book through the TripAdvisor website. Also, TripAdvisor turning into an OTA and providing direct competition to its biggest customers might not fare well with the OTAs.In view of TripAdvisor's Instant Booking platform's success, we have forecasted its advertisement page revenue per thousand impressions (RPM) to increase from $63 in 2014 to almost $67 by the end of our forecast period. However, given the lack of demand from its two biggest customers, Priceline and Expedia, if the RPM declines to $55 by the end of our review period, then TripAdvisor's price estimate would be decreased by almost 15%.Disclosure: None"
3360435,86036,2015-07-27T13:43:34-04:00,"Selling and marketing related expenses hurt TRIP’s bottom line in the second quarter.But higher operating expenses are necessary right now as TRIP looks to grow traffic and widen brand recognition.Its long-term growth story is intact with hotel reservation segment, Instant Booking feature along with partnerships with leading hotel chains shoring up the topline growth.","Last week, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) shares fell sharply. Despite a solid double digit percentage revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter, a sell-off was triggered as the online travel review and booking services provider handed lower-than-expected financial numbers. In my opinion, this sharp decline should rather be considered as an opportunity to buy as TRIP's long-term growth prospects are promising. Indeed, I would like to reiterate by my previous stance on the company.Fall in Earnings Shouldn't be a matter of concern, it's a good long-term playIn the second quarter, TripAdvisor's profit plunged to $58 million, or 40 cents a share, from $68 million, or 47 cents a share, in the same period of last year. I am not surprised though. Indeed, as I discussed in my previous article, TRIP's bottom line in the short-run was bound to get impacted owing to rising operating costs. In the recently concluded quarter ended June 30 2015, TRIP's selling and marketing expenses rose to $192 million, up from $127 million, in the year-earlier quarter.Competition is heating up, TRIP is right in widening its brand recognitionTripAdvisor has beefed-up its marketing related budget as it looks to aggressively expand itself in a fiercely competitive online reservation market. TripAdvisor is not just competing with the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Yahoo! (YHOO) Travel, Bing Travel, or Priceline's (PCLN) Booking.com but also hosts of other travel related sites such as Airbnb, Kayak and HomeAway (NYSEARCA:AWAY). Likewise, in the hotel reservation business, TRIP does not have to contend with main rivals such as Yelp or OpenTable but many local sites as well across the globe.In this backdrop, TRIP will have to attract more and more users. It will have to keep boosting its user traffic. For that, it needs to spend a lot of money on widening its brand recognition through marketing and brand-direct efforts such as TV advertising. The company has in fact kept a TV advertising budget of $60 million for 2015 to market itself globally.Vacation rental marketplace, HomeAway, has set aside $100 million advertising budget in 2015 up from $60 million in 2014.Also, whilst it operating expenses have risen, its liquidity position hasn't deteriorated. Cash flows from operations, despite higher sales and marketing related expenses-rose in the fiscal second quarter. Cash flows from operating activities rose 27%, year-over-year to $200 million. It shows that the company is efficiently and effectively using cash.TRIP well positioned to sustain a solid revenue growthIn the second quarter, revenue grew by 25%, year-over-year, after taking the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. On currency-neutral basis, revenue jumped 35%. But most of the revenue growth right now is tied to its hotel segment. In the fiscal year 2014, hotel segment represented 91% of the total revenue.TRIP's hotel reservation segment, which includes several sites that provide online and mobile reservation services connecting diners and restaurants-represents just a fraction of its total revenue. But revenue from this segment could rise at much faster pace, looking ahead.TRIP, at present, is focused on gaining traction in Europe, where online hotel reservation business is expanding fast. According to Recruit-- a Japan-based online global matching platform-- only 16% of all reservations are made online right now.However, the Japanese company believes that online reservation is expected to grow considerably in Europe. Recruit recently acquired OpenTable's European rival, Quandoo-a Berlin based hotel reservation system that is used by 6000 restaurants spread across 10 counties. TRIP in the recent past has made a series of very good acquisitions in Europe, which include Mytable.it, Iens.nl, Restopolis and Lafourchette.Also, we have to take into account that TRIP's new feature, Instant Booking-which received tremendous response in the U.S. last year-will be soon rolled-out worldwide. This feature enables users to easily and swiftly reserve a hotel without leaving the TripAdvisor site. It should significantly boost users' growth and transactions.Further, there is more room for topline growth as TRIP has extended its instant booking partnerships with several prominent hotel chains such as Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR)."
3241336,22148,2015-06-08T18:20:08-04:00,"TripAdvisor continued several negative earnings trends during Q1.The online travel review and booking site has several catalysts, including the expected growth in online travel booking in Asia-Pacific.With the CFO transition, TripAdvisor remains on the watch list until a turnaround takes hold.","Over the last year, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has done the most to trip up its own stock. The online travel review site has consistently missed earnings estimates, even while generating fast growth for a stock worth more than $10 billion.The stock amazingly reached $110 all the way back in early 2014, but it now sits at only $76. The question is whether the stock can fight off the downtrend of the last 15 months mostly created by self-inflicted wounds.Potential CatalystTripAdvisor doesn't lack catalysts, with emerging markets and especially Asia-Pacific set to rapidly expand not only vacation travel, but also a shift to online from offline. The big news of the last few weeks are the rapidly shuffling investments in the online Chinese market with the Ctrip (CTRP) partnership purchase of eLong (NASDAQ:LONG) and the private equity investment in Qunar (NASDAQ:QUNR), along with an equity raise.Unfortunately, TripAdvisor isn't making any large in roads into Asia-Pacific, with revenue growth of only 20% in Q1. The online review site is only generating roughly 12% of revenue from the geographic region with the biggest upside potential over the next decade.The big question remains whether a U.S.-based firm can obtain a dominant position in the Asian region. Whether for political reasons or market diversity, the majority of online sites struggle to grasp a dominant hold in these markets.For now, TripAdvisor is generating the biggest growth from integrating the booking of attractions and restaurants along with hotels. The company is seeing plenty of catalysts with offering these services in Europe.Constant FailuresThough the online review site reported a strong 29% increase in Q1 revenues (36% on a constant currency basis), TripAdvisor continues to fail miserably in meeting estimates. One has to wonder if the CFO really wants to spend more time with family. Either way, the market will rarely allow a stock to see gains when producing quarterly numbers below estimates.Source: Earnings data from Yahoo FinancePossibly even worse, the company is now at the point where its earnings aren't even growing. Accelerating costs have completely swamped revenue growth. The forecast for Q2 of earning $0.55 per share is actually $0.06 below the target for the same quarter in 2014. When investors were paying over $100 for the stock, they had no idea that the company would earn generate flat earnings growth.Possibly the ultimate key to the stock finally rebounding is the ability of TripAdvisor to finally exceed estimates in Q2 and at least maintain Q3 expectations of strong growth. After a few quarters of flat to no growth, analysts forecast the EPS surging 33% in Q3. The sure way to create a bottom in the stock is for these numbers to hold and turn out conservative.TakeawayTripAdvisor remains a stock to watch, but the company needs better earnings predictability and the ability to generate earnings growth before it ever rallies. The turnover in the CFO position and the need to shift resources towards capturing the Asia-Pacific markets leave a big question mark on whether the company can shift back towards earnings growth."
3324375,24063,2015-07-14T11:24:18-04:00,Company’s short interest is 12% as a percentage of its float.Valuation is fair compared to other companies and supported by growth.TripAdvisor is financially sound on both the liquidity and solvency fronts.,"By Andrew SebastianTripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) may seem a little overvalued at first as it trades at a P/E of 58.6 on a trailing basis. Strong growth is forecasted for the company, however, and on a forward basis - TRIP trades at a P/E of 37.1, which is still a little pricey looking ahead a year but a nice haircut from its trailing value. Looking out even further, its 5-year PEG is 1.65. But how does TRIP stack up against other companies in the online bookings and travel industry? Similarly-sized competitor based on market cap, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), has a trailing P/E of 31.5 and a forward P/E of 27.7. Smaller competitor, Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE:OWW), has had low earnings on a trailing twelve months basis making its trailing P/E not useful for valuation, but its forward P/E stands at 32. Looking at each company's PEG numbers, EXPE trades at 1.69 and OWW at 10.36. Out of the three companies, it seems EXPE is the best buy over the next year, but TRIP is similarly valued to EXPE on an earnings basis looking out even further.In addition to considering valuation, we also like to consider how hedge funds are trading the shares of a company because our research has shown that their stock picks historically managed to generate alpha even though the filings are up to 45-days delayed. We used a 60-day delay in our back tests to be on the safe side and our research showed that the 15 most popular small-cap stocks among hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Total Return Index by an average of 95 basis points per month between 1999 and 2012. After adjusting for risk, our calculations revealed that these stocks' monthly alpha was 80 basis points. We have also been sharing and tracking the performance of these stocks since the end of August 2012, during which time they have returned 142%, outperforming the S&P 500 ETF by nearly 84 percentage points (see more details here). TRIP's market cap and EXPE's put them in the high mid-cap to low large-cap range, but OWW is a small-cap stock with a market cap of just $1.3 billion. We wanted to compare TRIP to at least one small-cap to see if it made sense going in that direction. The comparative valuations suggest that TRIP or EXPE are the better choices and that OWW is a little pricey.A number of hedge funds had positions in the shares of TRIP with Eminence Capital leading the way with a new position of 2.45 million shares as of its latest filings. Eminence's position was worth $219 million at TRIP's price as of writing or about 2% of its market cap. Eminence was followed by Par Capital with a 2.1 million share stake as well as Matrix Capital and Alkeon Capital with 1.7 million shares each. Eleven funds added positions in their latest filings, and ten increased their holdings. While five funds kept their positions the same, nine reduced them and twenty exited their positions. Further, TRIP had a short interest of 12% as a percentage of its float. Other hedge funds could be on the short side of the trade in addition to being long.TRIP has a good history of generating returns on equity (ROE) north of 20% and returns on capital (ROC) north of 15%. The returns have been trending downwards, but ROE is 21% on a trailing twelve months basis and ROC is 15% - signifying strength. TRIP also maintains a solid liquidity position with current and quick ratios of 2 and 1.9, respectively. The company's debt is also minimal with a debt-to-equity ratio of only 28%. Revenue growth has been similarly strong and was 30% in the last fiscal year. On the operations side, TRIP recently announced that Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) would partake in instant bookings on the TripAdvisor system and that more companies were to join Marriott in the future.As the number of online booking and travel platforms proliferate, it is likely that some consolidation is on the horizon and TRIP could make for an attractive acquisition candidate. The company is financially sound in terms of liquidity and solvency, and it generates substantial returns on equity and capital. Its valuation is not exorbitant given its high growth, so an investment in TRIP could be good for the everyday investor and not just an acquirer. In this instance, the short interest and high number of exits should not scare investors away from investing in TRIP. It seems that the company has a nice future ahead of it, and it should generate decent returns for shareholders going forward."
3347435,88786,2015-07-22T16:25:49-04:00,"TripAdvisor will report Q2 results Thursday after the market closes.As a long-term investor, I will not be focusing on the analyst estimate but rather on how its collaboration with Marriott will play out.With partnerships and an improvement in its credit facilities, I’m hopeful that this company will continue to grow at a rapid rate.I’m long TripAdvisor going into earnings.","IntroductionThe travel industry, which is estimated at $8 trillion, is one of the largest industries in the world. Now, the industry seems to be extremely hot as the economy shifts gears into a steady recovery. With that said, I believe travelers will be interested in using TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP) to both plan and book their trips. As the company will be reporting its second quarter financial report on Thursday, shareholders and analysts will be keen to know whether or not recent partnerships will bear fruit. For instance, a partnership with Marriott International (NYSE: MAR) will likely kick TripAdvisor's scorching hot growth into overdrive in terms of revenue and also net profit.Analyst EstimatesAs a long-term investor, I tend not to put too much emphasis on the short-term quarterly estimates. For some of us who are interested in the numbers, the analyst EPS estimate is at $0.55 per share while the revenue estimate is approximately $413 million. Over the last year, TripAdvisor has never once beaten the estimates given by analysts. In the coming quarter, it's anyone's guess.Forward-Looking GrowthTripAdvisor's first quarter results showed the long trend that we've seen from the travel company, with excellent growth in revenue nevertheless failing to translate into healthier earnings. Revenue climbed steadily by 29% from the year-earlier quarter. I'm very encouraged to see those results as this figure has taken into account foreign exchange headwinds. Revenue which has been derived from international markets was also strong and increasing.One deal that has particularly caught the attention of investors and Wall Street was the collaboration of Marriott International and TripAdvisor, where the former would add its global hotel portfolio to the latter's Instant Booking platform. When the company announced on 17 June, many anticipated that the deal would give TripAdvisor an edge over its competitors in the online booking space. And true enough, the stock rocketed by 15% that very day in response to the news. With both companies having shared values in the travel space, this partnership will certainly propel both of them into greater top and bottom line results.The partnership threatens to change the way companies do business in the industry. If TripAdvisor can demonstrate success with its approach, it could entice more hotel companies to join its ranks and chip away at its rivals' market share while expanding their global footprint.On top of all that, the company said that it had replaced its existing credit facility late last month. The company is adding $400 million to enlarge its total capacity to a billion dollars. Hopefully, the company is able to capitalize on this move by strengthening its liquidity profile and provide additional flexibility with attractive rates as mentioned by CFO Julie Bradley.ConclusionAll eyes will be on how TripAdvisor performs Thursday, particularly when it comes to the partnership and also its global travel markets. With the strong dollar, there is a great chance that Americans will travel and those trips might just appear in the numbers that will be announced. I am also very keen to get more information about how the deal with Marriott is working out, as it will have a tremendous impact on TripAdvisor's revenue, growth and profits over the next five years or more."
3174496,76475,2015-05-13T12:06:52-04:00,TripAdvisor’s top line growth has remained largely unaffected by the slowdown we are witnessing in the online travel space.This can be chalked up to the company’s huge moat which helps it to attract large amounts of traffic.TripAdvisor is likely to keep posting strong growth for years to come making it a good long-term holding.,"The online travel space has usually been quite attractive for long-term investors due to the strong growth exhibited by players in the space. But lately, OTAs such as Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) have started showing worrying signs of slowing growth. Priceline, the leader of the space, has seen its growth slow from the mid-20s percentages a year ago to the low teens for the last quarter. The company also guided for 0%-7% growth in the current quarter, which will turn out to be the lowest quarterly growth by the company since it went public.I have mentioned the recent performance of the two companies because TripAdvisor's (NASDAQ:TRIP) performance is inexorably tied to them. TripAdvisor derives 46% of its revenue from Priceline and Expedia. TripAdvisor recently delivered better-than-feared results that showed that it has not been affected much by the slowdown that we are seeing in the online travel space. Despite the slowdown by the two OTAs, TripAdvisor is likely to continue growing at a healthy clip.Sound Business and MoatTripAdvisor uses metasearch to drive traffic to Priceline and Expedia. Once people read hotel reviews on TripAdvisor, they often click through to the two OTAs to do their booking. TripAdvisor receives a huge amount of traffic on its site - about 2.5 billion visits every year. About 10% of this traffic ends up being directed to the two leading OTAs. Both Priceline and Expedia place their ads on TripAdvisor's website. TripAdvisor is able to make money through click-based ads (70% of its revenue) and display-based ads (10% of its revenue).Though the relationship between TripAdvisor and the two OTAs is largely symbiotic, some cracks have started appearing. TripAdvisor recently launched Instant Booking, a platform through which users can book directly to hotels without going through OTAs. This is definitely a slap across the face of the two OTAs. But, it's highly unlikely that either Priceline or Expedia will be willing to ditch TripAdvisor in favor of rival travel review sites. Though there are other travel review sites such as VibeAgent, Zoover, TravelPost and Google Places, TripAdvisor enjoys a market share north of 60%. If any of the two OTAs decided to break its relationship with TripAdvisor, it would suffer a huge decline in the amount of traffic it receives and a drop in revenue. It's not likely that either company is ready to go down that road. This is a wide moat that TripAdvisor enjoys, and which is not likely be breached anytime soon.TripAdvisor remains a hugely popular travel review website, as evidenced by the robust 31% growth in monthly unique visitors to 340 million. In comparison, business review site Yelp (NYSE:YELP) could only muster 8% growth for this metric, despite having less than half of TripAdvisor's traffic - 142 million during the last quarter. TripAdvisor's massive amounts of content are what makes the website so valuable to users. The site has accumulated 225 million reviews on 4.9 million places, dwarfing the operations of any other travel site. People naturally trust a site with 40 or 50 reviews on a certain property than say 5-10 reviews. As TripAdvisor's reviews keep growing exponentially, the site becomes even more valuable to users and attracts even more users in a virtuous cycle that keeps growing.As long as people keep flocking to TripAdvisor's site and viewing its ads, the company's top line will keep expanding.Less Negative Impact by Programmatic AdvertisingThere is a big ongoing transformation in the online ad space that has been taking its toll on many ad platforms. Many marketers have been increasingly opting for programmatic ads at the expense of traditional display-based ads. This is a big problem for companies that rely heavily on display-based as because programmatic ads carry much lower CPM rates than traditional display ads. eMarketer estimates that programmatic ads will account for 55% of display ad revenue in the current year, equivalent to $14.9 billion. This trend is expected to pick up steam to reach 63% of display ad revenue in 2016, equivalent to $20.4 billion.The negative effect of programmatic ads is clearly evident on TripAdvisor's ad revenue. The company's click-based ads grew a healthy 20% to $249 million. In comparison, TripAdvisor's display-based ad revenue grew only 9% to $35 million, which can be chalked up to the lower CPM rates by programmatic ads.Luckily for TripAdvisor, the company is not as heavily dependent on display-based ads as many ad companies are. TripAdvisor's display-based revenue accounted for just 10% of its overall revenue during the last quarter, after falling from 11% for the prior year quarter. Since this segment is growing significantly slower than the company's other segments, it will gradually fall as a percentage of the company's revenue and thus minimize the negative effects on TripAdvisor's top line growth.Room for Mobile GrowthIf TripAdvisor has a glaring weakness, it has to be its ability to monetize mobile platforms. The biggest reason why TripAdvisor has been able to see its growth accelerate from the low 20s percentages in 2012 to the mid-30s percentages last year can be chalked up to robust mobile growth. TripAdvisor mobile downloads reached 190 million, representing about 50% Y/Y growth. The vast majority of these downloads - 170 million - have come from TripAdvisor's core mobile app.But, TripAdvisor said last year that monetization rates on mobile are only 20% compared to those on desktop. To improve the monetization rates of its mobile apps, TripAdvisor has been launching secondary apps each targeting a different niche market. These include mobile apps such as JetSetter, TripAdvisor City Guides, SeatGuru and GateGuru. These apps are helping more people discover the company's website and increase its traffic.Strong Growth in Subscription RevenueTripAdvisor launched its subscription-based business back in 2009 with the introduction of Business Listings. These enable hotels to place their contact information and links to their websites on property pages by TripAdvisor. More than 10% of hotel and lodging listings on TripAdvisor are tied to Business Listings' subscriptions and the number is growing at a healthy clip.TripAdvisor's subscription-based revenue jumped 88% to $79 million, much faster than its core ad revenue growth. This new business has become an important segment for the company since it currently accounts for 21% of overall revenue. With the segment enjoying such robust growth, TripAdvisor is now in a better position to offset any weaknesses in its core ad segment.Bottom LineTripAdvisor appears to be well inured against the ravages that are sweeping through the online travel space. The company enjoys a wide moat that helps it to attract large amounts of traffic to its site and keep growing its core ad segment. I believe the company will remain a compelling long-term investment for years to come."

Propelled by growing click-based revenues and the full quarter contribution of its acquisitions (LaFourchette and Viator) the world's largest travel review company posted revenues of $288 million in Q4 2014, up by 35% year-on-year.All the three divisions of TripAdvisor contributed to the strong top line growth in the fourth quarter:The setback faced by TripAdvisor in the third quarter, due to the seasonal decline in the click per hotel shopper and a weak bottom line growth, was adequately overcome in the fourth quarter. In Q4 2014, TripAdvisor's adjusted EBITDA increased by around 88% on a year-over-year basis to reach $98 million. This was mainly due to high expenditures in television advertising in Q4 2013, which increased expenses and in turn reduced EBITDA for that quarter. TripAdvisor's non-GAAP net income increased year-on-year by 73% to reach $52 million in the fourth quarter. According to Google Analytics, TripAdvisor's websites had more than 2.5 billion unique visitors during 2014, reflecting a 25% year-on-year growth.We have mentioned in our previous articles that we believe TripAdvisor will eventually reap the benefits of its investment initiatives and it will translate its strong top line performance into healthy bottom line growth. It seems that the TripAdvisor's growth path is pretty viable now. The earnings results came out at the higher end of management expectations.According to TripAdvisor's President and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Kaufer, TripAdvisor laid its foundation for future growth in 2014. Bookers can now plan, compare, as well as complete the booking process of the three most popular travel categories (hotels, attractions, and restaurants) through TripAdvisor's website. TripAdvisor has gradually evolved into a ""supermarket"" for travel needs with its exhaustive array of products and services. The company plans to aggressively scale and promote this holistic travel platform in 2015. [1]We are in the process of updating our current price estimate of $94 for TripAdvisor's stock.TripAdvisor's Instant Booking PlatformIn Q1 2014, TripAdvisor rolled out its Instant Booking feature which is aimed at reducing the friction related to mobile bookings. The user experience is enhanced by allowing users to complete all booking related steps from selecting a room to inputting personal and credit details on the TripAdvisor platform itself. With its Instant Booking Platform, TripAdvisor plays the role of an intermediary between a traditional online travel agent (OTA) and a travel advertising website. Customers can do the booking while remaining on the TripAdvisor page, however, the customer information is sent to the hotel so that the credit card is charged by the hotel and other payment related support is offered by the hotel itself. This is a unique model in the existing marketplace and hence gaining partners on the platform is taking longer than usual according to management. The company aims to spread the new avatar of TripAdvisor through online and offline channels, through their ""plan, compare and book"" message. In 2015, the company plans to spend around $60 million toward TV advertisements, in order to spread the message across the globe.Monetization Should Improve With Instant Booking On Mobile ApplicationsThe mobile platform has been a double-edged sword for TripAdvisor until now because TripAdvsior's mobile web version, though one of the most popular downloads on the travel space, lacks monetization to a great extent. Most of the time people use it do their research and then go back to desktop to finish their transactions. Hence the lack of monetization creates a headwind for TripAdvisor. The Instant Booking initiative will change the scenario as the booking option will be available in the mobile application itself. The application will encompass an overall travel experience for the user. For example - starting from finding a restaurant to planning the entire day when the user is on a trip. This in turn will build the stickiness for the product. Hence, the monetization factor will receive a stimulus with the Instant Booking Application. In 2014, TripAdvisor mobile applications have been downloaded nearly 175 million times (110% year-on-year growth). Though the company has achieved monetization on the phone, it has not been huge and TripAdvisor expects Instant Booking to drive more meaningful growth through the mobile platform.How Is The Instant Booking Platform Progressing?According to a recent comScore study, above 40% of online hotel bookers, in nine of the top markets for TripAdvisor, visited the travel review website at some juncture prior to booking. Hence, Instant Booking will aid in monetizing the user views by offering them a platform to compare prices and eventually book. Instant Booking is being rolled out to desktop and tablet users in the U.S. and a small percentage in the U.K. The platform would be rolled out on a global scale, eventually. [2]Partner Aspect of The Booking PlatformCurrently, there are 43 partners (12 of which are currently live on the platform) that have committed to the Instant Booking platform. In the fourth quarter, an Instant Booking beta was launched on TripConnect (TripAdvisor’s self-service auction platform), thus providing independent hoteliers with direct access to TripAdvisor’s global booking demand. Partners have so far given positive feedback noting that Instant Booking has rapidly become one of their most effective marketing channels.Disclosure: No positions."
3066316,86036,2015-04-13T12:15:54-04:00,"TripAdvisor posted strong revenue growth in 2014.There have been concerns about the company’s rising advertising and marketing-related costs.However, TripAdvisor is well-positioned for sustainable revenue growth, which makes the company’s stock a good long-term investment.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has been growing at a steady pace after it was spun off from its parent company, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) in 2011. Thanks to a spate of strategic acquisitions both in the U.S. and abroad, TripAdvisor gained traction globally and its annual revenue rose consistently.Last financial year was also a good one as the company posted a solid 32% revenue growth year-over-year. All of its revenue generating segments - click-based advertising, display-based advertising and subscription and transactions - showed solid double-digit percentage growth, year-over-year.Rising Advertising CostsHowever, there are some concerns. As the company has grown, so have advertising and marketing related costs. This year, TripAdvisor's ad-spend is set to jump to $60 million.The stock fell more than 8% last year after TripAdvisor reported that its costs ballooned 58% in the fiscal third quarter due to higher adverting related expenses.Another concern is TripAdvisor's relatively high P/E ratio, which is 56 compared to the industry average of 40.But the Company's look Well-Positioned for a Sustainable Revenue GrowthTripAdvisor looks expensive based on trailing twelve month P/E but that said, I see many positive developments in the recent past that will ensure a sustainable revenue growth in the future thus justifying the valuation.Let me discuss why I feel that the stock has a tremendous upside potential in the long-term.'Instant Booking' Feature to help monetize from mobile appsTripAdvisor has seen a phenomenal jump in its mobile app downloads in the recent past. In 2014, app downloads of TripAdvisor - including those of TripAdvisor City Guides, Jetsetter, SeatGuru and Gateguru, - reached almost 175 million. This represented an increase of 110%, year-over-year. A year before, total app downloads were 82 million, growth of 145%, year-over-year.While a staggering number of mobile apps download do emphasize TripAdvisor's market dominance, still it did not automatically translated in to revenues.As Trefis noted in a recent article here on SA, mobile apps did not provide travelers a booking option; hence, transactions were finished through desktops instead. And so, mobile apps missed out on a great monetization opportunity.However, things could change soon. TripAdvisor introduced a new feature, Instant Booking, last year, which would allow travelers to complete transactions on mobile apps itself. The company has introduced this feature in the U.S. last year but it will be soon rolled-out in other markets as well.In 2014, about 50% of users visited TripAdvisor through tablets and mobile phones.Some Good Acquisitions in 2014As I mentioned earlier, one of the key factors why TripAdvisor has been growing at a consistent pace is due to its sound acquisition-based strategy. However, the company knows it will have to add more booking and review sites in its portfolio of brands if it has to ensure a sustainable revenue growth. And that's why 2014 was a remarkable year for the company as it made some good acquisitions. According to President and CEO Steve Kaufer, 2014 was a year in which TripAdvisor ""laid the foundation for future"".Prominent among those acquisitions was Viator, an online platform offering reviews on tours and attractions. Since February, Viator has also introduced a new feature, Marketplace, which would enable more partners to list their businesses and more travelers to finish bookings for tours and activities, via the platform. .Growing Traction in European Restaurant Reservation BusinessAnother aspect which I like about TripAdvisor is its growing dominance in the restaurant reservation business in Europe. In the fourth quarter, TripAdvisor acquired hosts of restaurant reservation platforms, which include a Dutch rating and reservation site, lens.nl, and mytable.it and restopolis in Italy.These acquisitions have helped TripAdvisor gain a big chunk of the market-share in Europe's restaurant reservation business. For instance, lens.nl, which has roughly 20,000 restaurant reviews, attracts about 20 million annual visitors. lens.nl expects its sales to be in excess of 6 million euros this year.Earlier in May 2014, TripAdvisor had acquired Lafourchette, allowing the company to gain a foothold in very sizeable French and Spanish restaurant reservation market.Potential Growth in APACThe APAC region is another area which holds a lot of potential for TripAdvisor's future growth. APAC is one of the fastest growing markets for the company.TripAdvisor estimates both intra-APAC and APAC outbound travel accounts for about a third of total global passenger air traffic volume right now. In the next fifteen years, however, the APAC region will account for more than half of the global growth in passenger air-traffic volume.In the financial year 2014, revenue from the APAC region rose 28%, year-over-year to $156 million, which was only 13% of the total revenue. This means that TripAdvisor has a great scope to further bolster its top-line growth from the region given the solid growth forecast. .A Good Long-Term InvestmentThis is an excellent time to buy TRIP as the current price level makes it a good long-term investment. While the P/E ratio for trailing twelve months is higher than the industry average, its forward P/E of 28.68 is much more reasonable. While this is still higher than the multiples for Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE:OWW) and Priceline Group (PCLN), it is justified given the factors I have discussed above. In fact, TripAdvisor is expected to see earnings growth of 24.11% over the next five years, compared to growth of nearly 20% for Orbitz Worldwide and 19.5% for Priceline."

Never mind the fact that both OTAs get a lot of their traffic from TripAdvisor. What does the move mean for TripAdvisor and the two OTAs?Symbiotic RelationshipThe relationship between TripAdvisor and the two OTAs is largely symbiotic. TripAdvisor is the largest travel review site and has managed to accumulate a staggering 200 million reviews on more than 4 million hotels and other resorts on its site. To underscore the massive popularity of the site, consider that more than 1.25 billion people visited the site to read reviews on their favorite hotels during the first half of 2014. TripAdvisor is reputed to control a market share north of 60%, dwarfing the operations of competitors Zoover, VibeAgent, Google Places and TravelPost.But don't let TripAdvisor's business model fool you - the company really is an ad company, deriving about 80% of its revenue from ads (70% click-based + 10% display-based). With so much traffic, OTAs like Priceline and Expedia have quite naturally noticed and use the site to place ads. Once people finish reading reviews on TripAdvisor, many click through to the OTAs where they do their booking. About 10% of TripAdvisor's traffic is directed to the OTAs, meaning somewhere in the region of 250 million visits every year. TripAdvisor gets about 47% of its ad revenue from the two OTAs. The relationship between TripAdvisor and the two OTAs is, therefore, very symbiotic.But that's only part of the story. TripAdvisor uses metasearch to drive traffic to the two OTAs. The company's click-based ad revenue via its metasearch platform clocked in at $247 million, or 31% year-over-year growth. The two OTAs are not the only ones that benefit from TripAdvisor's metasearch platform. Other rival sites benefit as well, and contribute almost as much revenue to TripAdvisor's top line as Priceline and Expedia combined. The company's metasearch offers travelers an alternative booking platform that lets travelers book direct to hotels without going through an OTA. Metasearch is particularly popular with millenials.According to digital researchers L2 Think Tank, 39% of millenials and 25% of baby boomers use metasearch to book hotels instead of doing it through traditional OTAs and other branded sites. It's not hard to see why Priceline and Expedia are not too keen to lend a helping hand to an already formidable rival. TripAdvisor chief executive Steve Kaufer described Instant Booking as a cross between a metasearch website and an OTA, which must have spooked OTAs even more.TripAdvisor is not the only travel company that employs a metasearch platform. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns HotelFinder and FlightSearch, which allow people to book hotels or flights directly from the platforms without using OTAs.What Does It Mean For TripAdvisor?TripAdvisor has been having a slog trying to get hotels to sign up with Instant Booking. According to Skift, hotels are not sure whether to treat the economics of Instant Booking as they would with traditional OTAs or as direct bookings. Another big reason is that integrating Instant Booking into their websites requires some tech work by both the hotels and TripAdvisor.But this does not in any way mean that Instant Booking won't eventually gain some traction. The fact that 10% of TripAdvisor's traffic clicks through to OTAs to do their booking tells you that a large percentage of the site's traffic is highly relevant. The potential for the product is definitely there, only that it might take long, perhaps much longer than TripAdvisor would like, before it can really get moving.What Does It Mean For OTAsAs things stand, Instant Booking will probably take many years to get enough traction to become a real threat to the leading OTAs. Take Google for instance. Despite having a large metasearch platform, Google has not done much to slow down the growth of the leading OTAs. This could be because of the ease and convenience of booking through OTAs. And, of course, good old human behavior, which tends to resist change. It's hard to see Instant Booking growing to a level where it will start disrupting the business models of the leading OTAs, at least not anytime soon.Bottom LinePriceline and Expedia are not likely to feel any heat due to the entry of TripAdvisor into the OTA space. However, depending on the effort TripAdvisor puts into trying to make the platform easier to use by hotels, it could end up gaining meaningful traction."

Selling and marketing costs for the quarter stood at $159 million.The travel services providing website’s fundamentals are strong, with their focus currently on improving customer satisfaction through their mobile products, as well as their expansion into the restaurant reservation platform.","Earlier this month TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP) announced that it had agreed to buy Iens, a leading Dutch online restaurant review and booking site. This has been another acquisition by the world's largest travel review website which is trying to reposition itself in a way that will allow it to offer more services to its customers than just providing reviews.The new acquisition will allow TripAdvisor customers to have access to more than 20,000 new restaurant reviews and will allow them to book tables at different restaurants through SeatMe, which is also being acquired by TripAdvisor. The acquiring company also has the added benefits of adding Iens' 20 million annual customers, as well as the website's revenue generating capabilities with which it expects to make up to €6 million this year. This is not the first company TripAdvisor has acquired recently. In May last year, the company acquired LaFourchette and has streamlined the website's reservation experience as well as launching their instant reservation feature; a feature that allows users to make restaurant reservations at 13,000 restaurants in Western Europe. The move helped triple the number of seated diners from TripAdvisor through the LaFourchette platform. The company also acquired Viator, an online service that gives access to more than 20,000 tours and attractions across 1,500 destinations in multiple languages. The company expects the acquisition of Viator to pay off in the coming days, citing it as the biggest development of the quarter.Despite the acquisition spree and the constant efforts by the company to get hotels to sign up with Instant Booking, the stock has not been performing quite so well in the past year. When TripAdvisor released its third quarter earnings last year on the 4th of November, the revenue figures beat the expectations of analysts but the travel company missed its profit target for the quarter, which reflected in the after-hours trading of the stock as the share price plummeted by 15% from $83.79 per share to $71.95 per share. Net income for the quarter came out to be $54 million as compared to $56 million from the same period last year, leaving EPS at $0.38 down by 1 cent from the same quarter last year and missing Wall Street consensus estimates $0.60 per share by a significant margin. North American revenues increased by 35% to $176 million on a year-on-year basis, accounting for 50% of the total revenue, while sales in Latin America sped up by 78% to $16 million, accounting for 5% of total revenue. International revenues accounted for 53% of third quarter revenues, flat year over year. But investors should note the long term benefit of TripAdvisor's strategy. They are expanding their services portfolio in a very smart fashion that will encourage customers to stay on their site to review and book their outings, a strategy that has already started impacting its rivals in the online travel agency industry such as Expedia and Priceline. When we take a closer look at the financial results of TripAdvisor we can see that the loss in profits occurred as TripAdvisor amped up their marketing campaign which has eaten into their earnings. Selling and marketing costs for the quarter stood at $159 million, up by nearly 64% from last year's sum and overall expenses grew by 56%. The Massachusetts based company spent $19 million on offline advertising and plans to spend a cumulative $30 million by the end of 2014. Despite the loss in profits from the increased expenditure, the marketing campaign is proving to be successful as Google Trends data shows that in the countries where the advertisements were launched there was an increase in traffic growth.What seems to have happened to TripAdvisor's stock price is merely a harsh reaction by the market towards the company for not meeting its earnings target. The travel services providing website's fundamentals are strong, with their focus currently on improving customer satisfaction through their mobile products, as well as their expansion into the restaurant reservation platform. These recent acquisitions will help the company expand its market share, a fruit which it will bear in the coming years when these new assets limit the impact of its competition.Currently trading at $68.18 per share, the stock has seen better days but investors should not take the price dip as a bad sign. Investors have a brilliant opportunity to make some substantial capital gains with TRIP stock. What we can expect from the next earnings release which is scheduled for the 11th of February is that revenues will stay above the $300 million mark while profits might fail to meet targets again as the company is more focused on capturing a larger portion of the market rather than optimizing their profits from their existing customers."

(NASDAQ: TRIP) will announce its earnings for the 3rd quarter of 2014 on November 4th. The company is expected to beat analysts' estimates for revenue and earnings. Revenues for the company have grown steadily over the course of the previous year and the company has managed to achieve sequential as well as year on year increases in earnings. TripAdvisor's share price has dropped over the course of the quarter from a high point of $104.51 as at 26th August 2014 to a low of $78.89 as at October 15th. Prices have shown signs of recovery since then they have increased to $88.66 on the back of positive earnings expectations in the current quarter.Analysis of TripAdvisor Inc's Q2 Financial ResultsLooking at TripAdvisor's last reported financial results, the company was able to generate incredible revenue growth of almost 31%, more than 3 times the industry average of 9.6%. Top-line growth was able to translate into earnings growth as well as it trickled down to all tiers of the company's financials. The company's stocks have shown a rising trend over the course of the year as investor confidence has remained strong through its steady earnings growth. The company's return on equity was reportedly smaller relative to the previous year's quarter, but it still exceeded the industry average as well as average ROE for firms in the S&P 500. However, TripAdvisor's net income growth underperformed compared to the industry average of companies in the Internet & Catalog Retail market, as well as the S&P 500. The travel review company is also in need of better debt management as its debt to equity ratios exceeded the industry averages despite being low on a stand-alone basis.Analysts' estimates for Q3 and FY 2014 EarningsAnalysts are expecting higher earnings for TripAdvisor's 3rd quarter of 2014. Analysts' consensus estimates for earnings per share are projecting earnings to grow 31% over the year ago quarter to 51 cents per share. Analysts' earnings estimates for the full fiscal year 2014 stand at $1.81 per share. Growth rates for TripAdvisor's revenue are expected to accelerate further. Revenues for the quarter are expected to grow 37% to $349 million as compared to $255 million in the 3rd quarter of 2013. Analysts' revenue projections for TripAdvisor for the full fiscal year amount to $1.24 billion. Despite its accelerating top-line growth, income growth for the company has slowed down and remained relatively flat over the course of the last 2 years.Reasons for Positive Earnings Estimates for TripAdvisor's 3rd QuarterTripAdvisor Inc. operates the world's largest travel website and its fundamentals have remained solid over the last few years. Its strong fundamentals, its focus on improvement of mobile products and expansion of business operations could be the main driving forces behind analysts' optimistic estimates for the 3rd quarter of 2014. TripAdvisor took a big step toward expanding its business operations through its acquisitions of LaFourchette and Vacation Home Rentals as it broke into the markets for vacation rentals and international restaurant reservations. These acquisitions helped the company in expanding its user base and allowed for more hits on the website. The company was able to facilitate travel decisions of customers and allow them to plan their vacations with greater ease. The company's effective execution of growth strategies, especially through monetization of mobile and social media platforms, has led to improving margins and has positioned the company well enough to deliver a strong financial performance.Future Outlook for TripAdvisor Inc.Over the years, TripAdvisor has continued to innovate and hopes to carry on with its forward looking approach in the years to come. The company is working on the integration of restaurant reservations from its LaFourchette acquisition via Instant Booking processes. Instant Booking will give TripAdvisor an edge over its competitors and attract more travelers as a result of its increased facilitation. The company has several other future growth prospects lined up, such as the inclusion of business listings via TripConnect and enhancing global outreach to the Far East. Growth and consolidation of the vacation rentals market is also expected to push the company forward further.ConclusionTripAdvisor Inc. has allowed investors to have greater confidence through its impressively accelerating top-line growth and its established stature in the Internet Catalog & Retail market. Share prices have shown steady growth over the years with a few patches of downward trends. However, any periods of dropping share prices have represented an ideal entry point for TripAdvisor's investors and they have been rewarded heavily for placing their confidence in the company. The current trend in prices is showing a recovery from a significant drop earlier in the month and would be an ideal entry point for investors. Analysts have been split in their opinion on TripAdvisor's shares with some giving it a hold rating and others giving it a buy rating. With its positive future growth prospects, TripAdvisor Inc. would be a worthy long-term investment."

The online travel review site continues with fast expansion amidst global growth initiatives. The company faces many global travel headwinds including slowing growth and the Ebola outbreak, but none of the issues should impact long-term travel trends. The reduced oil prices should help the industry, but the consistent growth prospects should top the issues making the stock volatile.Price and Time MattersA key theme for the end of this year is that price matters significantly when buying a stock. The difference between buying TripAdvisor at $110 back in March and around $79 now is enormous. The real key is that outside of short-term issues with Ukraine and Ebola nothing has really changed in the growth story. In fact, TripAdvisor is actually sporting higher growth rates recently than over the last five years. The 31% revenue growth rate in Q214 actually makes the stock more appealing.The below chart shows that all of the key stats continue growing. The issue with the stock decline this year was investors getting ahead of the actual growth rate. The adjusted EBITDA will work itself higher once the company reduces growth initiatives.Source: Q214 investor presentationCatalysts For 2015 And BeyondTripAdvisor is always constantly innovating and improving the process of making trip reservations. The company is currently working on the Instant Booking process for hotels and integrating restaurant reservations from the lafourchette acquisition. In addition, the company has several other catalysts for 2015 including business listings via TripConnect, growing and consolidating the vacation rentals market, and breaking further into international locations like China. The latter being the biggest unknown considering how the communist country tends to favor domestic organizations limiting outsiders.Source: Q214 investor presentationTakeawayTripAdvisor trades at a more attractive 28x forward earnings estimates after the large stock drop the last couple of months. The story continues to improve and the high level of spending to grow the brand depresses the earnings. The travel review site could easily expand margins if it wasn't busy expanding into restaurant reservations, vacation rentals, and international locations. On top of that, the dramatic drop in oil prices could become a huge boom to the travel industry. Sure the sector needs to get over the Ebola scare especially in the EMEA region, but the market hasn't seen the benefits of lower consumer spending on fuel in a long time outside of global meltdowns.TripAdvisor might face some booking issues for long international flights and extended vacations in the short term, but the company is set to expand making the stock attractive after consolidating over the last year."

However, earnings disappointed coming in below estimates at $0.48 per share (estimates were $0.60). The increase in earnings was spent on various marketing expenses as well as an overall increase in operating expenses.CatalystsThe biggest catalyst for TripAdvisor stock will be an increase in travel and travel-related searches on the web.TripAdvisor recently released a study concluding that 43% of U.S. respondents are planning to take a trip this winter. Considering the harshness of the winter months in 2013, travelers are already preparing for potential winter escapes for the cold months of 2014 and early 2015. TripAdvisor determined that 84% of respondents prefer to visit a warm destination during the winter, particularly areas that offer beaches. The top spots for this year include Cancun, Punta Cana, Las Vegas, Orlando, Key West and Honolulu. A surge in winter travel, along with an improving economy, could offer additional advertising revenues for TripAdvisor as traffic increases.I believe that, long term, TripAdvisor will continue to be one of the most highly-trafficked online travel research websites. Anyone searching for travel plans online is sure to find TripAdvisor toward the top of their search results. This advantage should allow the company to easily capitalize on an overall strengthening economy and improving travel market for several years ahead.Looking at the chart below, you can see that in the time since Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) spun off TripAdvisor, the newly-public issue has far exceeded the return of the market as a whole.Chart Courtesy of MorningstarTRIP currently trades at a price to earnings multiple of roughly 49.5, far surpassing the S&P average of 18.6. While this is absolutely a high P/E ratio, when compared to its industry average of 34, it seems more reasonable. The P/E ratio looks even more reasonable when you compare it to TRIP's growth rate. Looking at TripAdvisor's PEG Ratio (Price to Earnings in Relation to Growth), the company has a PEG of 0.9. This signifies that the company is currently trading at a level roughly equal to its growth rate, valuing it relatively fairly.RisksThe biggest risks to the company revolve around advertisers and web traffic. Web traffic can be very volatile and can change quickly from one area to another. If TripAdvisor is unable to continue to increase the amount of visitors it has to its websites, revenues could be negatively impacted.Since the company derives the majority of its revenue from advertisers, a decrease in ad spending by its clients could significantly reduce and hurt TripAdvisor's revenues.TripAdvisor tends to show up in the search results for nearly any travel or vacation related search. However, a change in the search engine algorithm or search results could quickly hurt the company and substantially lower traffic and revenues.ConclusionOverall, TripAdvisor is an interesting play on the travel industry. I anticipate the travel industry doing well over the next 3-5 years, which could positively impact TripAdvisor and send its stock higher. Having said that, the company does not come without its risks. The company's limited earnings history and high degree of reliance on external sources for traffic and revenue may make this stock too risky for some more conservative investors. Those investors with a higher risk tolerance may find some capital appreciation here over the next several years.This article is given for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as investment advice.

2653535,22148,2014-11-07T19:02:18-05:00,TripAdvisor reported Q314 earnings.The stock recommendation is now on hold.The original investment thesis didn't appreciate the level of expenses by TripAdvisor compared to the market expectations.,"The quarterly numbers for TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) extends a trend of the company growing revenue at a fast clip and spending even faster. The travel review site continues launching new products in new categories and expanding internationally leading to a substantial increase in the employee base by nearly 50% over Q3'13. The stock slumped following the quarterly report due to the higher expenses in growing non-hotel categories like restaurants and attractions that exceeded expectations. The stock now trades at $74, down nearly 33% from the peak of over $110 back during the summer.For Q3'14, TripAdvisor solidly beat on revenue with $354 million growing 39% YoY versus expectations of around $349 million. The big consternation in the results were the earnings that greatly missed estimates, adding to the recent trend of missing analyst estimates. For the quarter, the company only earned $0.48, missing analyst estimates by $0.12. Despite a sequential revenue increase of $31 million, TripAdvisor spent the whole increase on higher selling and marketing expenses. Combined with increases in other operating expenses, net income declined $10 million sequentially and was nearly flat with the prior year period. Guidance was another major concern for investors with the company guiding full-year EBITDA down to the low-20s range from a number that was much closer to 30% last quarter.The original investment thesis in the article ""Is TripAdvisor Attractive After A Year Of Consolidation?"" is placed on hold until the market fully understands the costs of the growth initiatives. At $74, the stock is definitely more attractive than at the peak levels over the summer, but it isn't clear now that the market fully appreciates the investment plan of the company. The average analyst estimate for 2015 earnings continues to plunge providing little cover for investors. Once these numbers bottom out over the winter and TripAdvisor emerges from the heavy spending plan next year, investors should definitely buy the stock for the typical hot summer travel season."
2553405,72575,2014-10-10T11:24:52-04:00,"TripAdvisor’s deal with Travel port provided its users with access to a broader range of hotel properties and bookings without leaving the website.The acquisition of Viator enhanced TripAdvisor’s bookable tours by 20,000 and added 600,000 reviews, photos and videos.Mobile or smart device apps account for 49% of the company’s total online traffic.","TripAdvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) is a growing company and is presently the second-largest online travel information agency in the market after Priceline Inc. (PCLN). The company spun off from Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) in 2011 and has gained spectacular popularity among travelers around the globe in a relatively small amount of time.Revenue DriversPresently, the company operates through three operating segments in 43 countries worldwide distributed across four geographical regions. The following graphs represent the top line distribution among the company's segments and geographies as per the second quarter of FY2014.Source: Second Quarter's StatementThe figures above show that 84% of the company's revenues are attributed to advertising if you add up click-based and display-based revenues. Moreover, Priceline and Expedia are actually TripAdvisor's largest clients, contributing 47% to the company's top line as per the annual report of FY2013. These companies, among other OTAs, pay a fee to TripAdvisor in order to place their ads on the company's website. This is one reason why the company's revenues escalated immediately after the separation from Expedia since the latter now purchases space on TripAdvisors's website.Growth StrategyThe company is well aware that its reliance on just two clients to generate a large part of its revenues is rather unwise because its top line may be crucially impacted if any one of these clients switches to a smaller rival. Although this seems highly unlikely to happen in the near future, it is unwise to take the chance for the long term. As a proactive company, TripAdvisor is already working on adding more to its business model.The company's current business model allows customers to post and read reviews on vacation properties and the website mainly acts as a facilitator between the traveler and online travel agencies (OTA). However, the company is aggressively expanding its services by initializing an ""Instant Booking"" feature, adding more hotels bookable through its website, and acquiring destination listing websites. These activities are intended to make the company self-sufficient and reduce its heavy reliance upon a couple of players in the market. The company's ""Instant Booking"" feature was launched in June 2014 and expanded due to the company's deal with Travelport. The deal provided TripAdvisor's users access to a broader range of hotel properties and bookings without leaving the website.In addition to that, the company has finalized the acquisition of Viator which increased TripAdvisor's bookable tours by 20,000 and added 600,000 reviews, photos and videos to the company's already large pool of reviews. Viator is TripAdvisor's fourth acquisition this year following LaFourchette, Tripbod and Vacation Home Rentals. Besides the acquisition spree, the company is rapidly developing its smart device presence attracting about 140 million unique users per month through smart devices. Mobile or smart device apps account for 49% of the company's total online traffic, making the channel crucially important for continued future growth.Revenue and Earnings Growth ProjectionThe company's revenues have grown at a CAGR of 22% during the past five years as of FY2013. The following graph indicates the company's quarterly revenues since FY2010 along with the revenue growth trend over time. If you look closely at the figure below you will see a pattern in the revenue generation through the quarters wherein sales increased through the first three quarters and then dropped in the last quarter of each fiscal year. If the company continues this pace then the revenue in the current quarter is expected to increase compared to the figure reported in the previous quarter thus enhancing the company's bottom line and EPS in this quarter.Source: Company PresentationWhile the company's revenues and profits might increase TripAdvisor is still expected to report lower earnings than its larger rival, Priceline. This becomes evident when comparing the two companies' forward P/E ratios. TripAdvisor's forward P/E ratio is 31.79 while Priceline's is 17.57.Moreover, comparing the current ratios of the two companies deems TripAdvisor overvalued in the market at its current price. TripAdvisor's P/E ratio presently stands at 60.92 compared to Priceline's current P/E ratio of 28.55, which is quite close to the industry average of 29.16.Concluding RemarksTripadvisor is not a good candidate for investment at its current price considering the fact that it is vastly overvalued in the market compared to its counterparts and it is expected to report lower earnings than its peers. The company does not pay any dividends and considering the fact that it is presently growing its operations through acquisitions, dividend payments are not likely to occur any time soon. It is a great company with a great business model but from an investment perspective I would recommend waiting until its price is at least justified."
2808865,22675,2015-01-09T05:52:39-05:00,,"Wow… So on Monday I opened my first long & short trade of the year. I mentioned in that post that I was shorting AOL despite having a hard time reading the company in recent years mostly because those takeover rumours seemed blown over. Then, the next day, news comes out that Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has/is considering taking over AOL. Then yesterday activist investor Starboard asks Yahoo to more seriously consider buying AOL. Are you kidding me? Ah well. Win some and lose some but this is not the start I was looking for obviously. That trade is down almost 10% which is certainly bad news but I guess given all the news and speculation, it could have been worse. Oh well, here I am with a second trade. I certainly aim on doing well over a larger set of trades as has happened in the past few years.Today, I'm opening my second trade and am once again shorting a stock that I've liked to bet against over the years. I've had a lot more success shorting this one though. Let's start off by looking at the numbers:Long TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP)I've done extremely well with my high conviction long-term speculative picks but last year's only bet, on TripAdvisor, has not paid off so far. I paid fairly close to TRIP's high and the recently difficult market conditions have had a big impact on TRIP. That being said, I'm very much considering adding to that position. I have a tremendous level of confidence in TRIP because in my opinion it is the clear leader in a very important market. Yes, other players may have bigger revenues but TRIP has the traffic, the community and the brand that will help it outperform in the long term. I have no doubt that revenues will continue to climb and perhaps even accelerate which makes it a good buy at these levels. That being said, the stock had a very tough earnings report and call a few months ago and I'll certainly pay close attention to what they come out with a month from now.Next earnings release: February 11th 2015Short Blue Nile (NASDAQ:NILE)Blue Nile is a great company that I actually like and have used. That does not, however, make it a good investment and when I look at the growth in revenues and earnings, they still do not justify what I'm seeing out of NILE. A few years ago, that was even more obvious but I still feel confident in saying that the upside vs. downside involved in shorting Blue Nile is very good. Just look at the difference in growth between the two companies and consider that they are trading at very comparable forward P/E ratios.Next earnings release: February 6th 2015Disclaimer: Long Tripadvisor (TRIP)"
2496765,72575,2014-09-15T17:32:04-04:00,"Online travel booking has shown tremendous growth over the years backed by the rapid adoption of smartphones and tablets along with facilitated internet access.TripAdvisor experienced strong financial growth over the last few years.With its strategic acquisitions, the company is all set to cater to the rising travel demand.","Online travel bookings have grown rapidly over the past few years as consumers increasingly shift their travel research and reservation activity online for better price transparency and convenience. TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), one of the top global online travel research companies, provides travel research platforms, comprehensive reviews and the opinions of members about destinations, accommodations, restaurants, attractions and activities all over the world to help travelers plan their vacations or traveling activities. The company not only provides rich travel services including hotel bookings, vacation rentals, airline tickets, vacation packages, destination services and even cruises but also provides price comparison tools to compare prices with other travel sites.The company owns the largest travel review website Tripadvisor.com with more than 280 million unique monthly visitors in a month. The company has over 170 million reviews and opinions on more than 850,000 hotels and other accommodation and approximately 640,000 vacation rentals, 2.3 million restaurants and 450,000 attractions in 142,000 destinations around the world.Financial GrowthSource: annual report 2013The company has experienced tremendous financial growth over the past few years driven by increasing global demand and changing consumer booking preferences. The company has managed to grow its revenue at a CAGR of 22% over the last three years driven by gains in each of its product segments including click-based advertising, display-based advertising, subscription, transaction and other.The growth is not limited to the company's top line as you see a generous growth in its bottom line is also evident. The company's bottom line grew at a CAGR of 7% over the past three years. In addition, the company's strong cash flow metrics supports its financial strength and provides future growth prospects, as the company has generated $350 million in operating cash flow in 2013 and $294 million in free cash flow in 2014.Investments in the FutureLast year, the company was making a series of acquisitions in order to grow its user base, increase its subscriptions, and improve transactions and business operations globally. During 2013, the company completed six acquisitions for a total cash consideration paid of about $34.8 million. The company acquired TinyPost, the developer of a product that enables users to write captions on photos and turn them into stories; Jetsetter, a members-only private salesite for hotel bookings; CruiseWise, a cruise research and planning site; Niumba, a Spain-based vacation rentalsite that features more than 230,000 properties globally and brings to TripAdvisor the world's largest collection of Spanish vacation rentals with more than 120,000 properties in Spain; GateGuru, a mobile app with flight and airport information around the world; and Oyster, a hotel review website that provides expert reviews on hotels around the world and photos covering about 150 cities.The company continues its acquisition spree this year as well. So far the company has made four strategic acquisitions including the acquisition of VacationHomeRentals.com that offers around 14,000 vacation rentals in more than 89 countries; Tripdod, a travel community that connects travelers directly to local experts to receive their recommendations; Lafourchette, an online restaurant booking platform with a network of more than 12,000 restaurant partners across Europe (mainly in France, Spain and Switzerland); and Viator, a provider of travel activities to more than 1,000 destinations worldwide.Market GrowthEasy access to computers, the adoption of smartphones and tablets and facilitated access to the internet makes it very convenient for travelers to make travel arrangements online. This is the reason why many emerging markets exhibited better growth rates than mature markets. Many travelers who could not afford leisure travel before can now afford international trips due to the attractive packages offered.According to the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA):Martin Craigs, CEO of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), said during the WTTC conference that in 2011 there were nearly 300 million travelers a year in China. By the end of 2029, he estimates there will be 1 billion. China's prediction to spend $1.3 trillion over the next 20 years on travel is also an indication of the growing number of travelers.In addition, the European online travel market will continue to grow faster than the total travel market averaging an annual growth rate of 8% through 2015. The rapid adoption of smartphones and tablets play a significant role in inflating online travel businesses.ConclusionIn the last few years, the company showed promising growth that was also reflected in the company's increasing stock price. So far, its series of strategic acquisitions to meet the increasing demand have caused the company to successfully attract investors as its stock price increased 18.9% YTD. The company is all set to cater to the increasing demand in Europe and the Asia Pacific region (mainly China) with its recent acquisition of Lafourchette and Viator. There is no doubt that the growth is evident and the company has a complete travel package under one roof to cater to consumers' needs. I believe it is a good investment opportunity for investors looking for growth companies."
2664175,67113,2014-11-11T09:11:47-05:00,"P/E ratio is at 60 and P/B ratio is 13.63. This screams overvaluation for investors. Latest earnings results missed estimates by a huge margin (3rd consecutive quarter estimates were missed).Ebola will continue to be a headwind for travel companies and if more cases are reported, their profits will be hit hard.Crude oil has formed a firm intermediate bottom. Higher oil prices will put pressure on the travel and airline industries.","Tripadvisor Inc (NASDAQ:TRIP) announced earnings last week and the stock dropped 14% as a result early last Wednesday morning. Let's go through why every rally should be sold in this stock from its current price of $73.65 a share.Firstly, its P/E ratio is at 60 (compared with an industry average of 9.2) underlying the company is overvalued with a market cap of $12.67B. P/E ratios can sometimes be misleading because earnings can be erratic from quarter to quarter but when you look at the price to book value which is 13.63, you quickly ascertain that the company is indeed overvalued. This means that current market price is 13 times more than its book value. This as an investor is too wide a ratio and for this ratio to revert to more normal levels, the share price will have to drop from here. Its price to sales ratio is 9.2 compared with 1.2 which is the industry average. All the important relative valuation metrics illustrate this stock is too pricey at these levels.So why is the stock down more than 33% from its yearly high back in June? Even though revenue figures beat estimates ($354 million last quarter), adjusted earnings per share (profit margins) came in at $0.48 missing estimates by a whopping 20%. The reason revenues are up is because they are pumping far more money into marketing as they try to hold on to as much market share as possible. With operating margins down 9% from 23.7% in Q2, the trend is very much down with now three consecutive quarters with declining operating margins. 800 new staff since the same quarter last year and more money being pumped into marketing ($159 million compared to $97 million for the same quarter last year) seem to be Tripadvisor's response in tackling the lower profit margins. I personally don't think it will work. Tripadvisor has far more competitors now than a few years back, predominantly Priceline Group Inc (PCLN) & Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), with the latter trading near yearly highs at the moment.Secondly I believe the current EBOLA situation will continue to be a headwind for travel companies. When fear is present, people usually stay in their homes even if the risk of infection is practically zero. Another one or two cases in the US would really get people thinking about whether to travel or not. Needless to say its click-based revenue growth was down substantially in the last quarter leading to the big sell off we had in the stock post earnings.Finally I believe oil may have formed a firm intermediate bottom last week or is in the process of doing so very shortly. In any event, a bottom is extremely close when you look at the chart below. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) & TSI (True Strength Index) levels are extremely oversold and have rallied hard from these levels in the past. Oil prices directly affect the airline and travel industries. If crude oil were to rally hard in the next few months from its present $78 a barrel price, it would definitely be bearish for Tripadvisor going forward.To sum up, Tripadvisor has far too many negatives at this moment in time. The main headwind it faces is impending higher oil prices and since the online travel industry has changed somewhat in the last few years with the emergence of strong competitors, I can't see the company regaining the market share it once had. Sell any rallies until the stock finds some meaningful support around $35 a share."
2537435,55342,2014-10-02T16:39:20-04:00,"TripAdvisor is a good company and looks poised to grow.That said, valuations don't seem to have factored in declining profit margins.TripAdvisor is a risky bet at current valuations.","TripAdvisor's (NASDAQ:TRIP) stock is now down by close to 17% since its Q2 2014 earnings release. Does the recent correction make it an attractive investment option? Maybe not. TripAdvisor is one of the more fundamentally sound Internet-based businesses. Strong revenue growth, profitability, interesting acquisitions and strategic improvements to features make it an exciting company. This could probably be the reason why the company's stock enjoys such premium valuations. However, TripAvisor's valuations are steep and make it vulnerable to further corrections in case of a revenue/earnings miss or any other negative events.TripAdvisor Stock Price MovementOn 23 July 2014, TripAdvisor announced its Q2 2014 earnings. In the week that followed, the stock tumbled by over 12%, falling from $107 a share to about $94 a share, on 1 Aug. The correction was triggered by TripAdvisor's adjusted EPS of $0.55 for Q2, which had missed analyst estimates by close to 10%.Source: AmigobullsFollowing an intermittent rebound, the stock has continued on its correction course. On 19 Sep 2014, Viator, a local tours and activities listing site which TripAdvisor acquired in Aug 2014, reported a data theft. The incident saw some of its customers' data including payment card information being compromised.Viator functions separately and has its own payment and security systems in place. So, technically, it wasn't TripAdvisor's security systems that had been breached. Further, though the news could impact Viator's revenue contribution to TripAdvisor, the impact is unlikely to be huge for the latter. However, following the press release, TripAdvisor's stock has taken a beating, falling by about 9% since markets opened on 22 Sep 2014.TripAvisor's current valuations make it vulnerable to any other such events, should they crop up.TripAdvisor Revenue GrowthTo give credit where it is due, TripAdvisor is financially sound. TripAdvisor's revenue has been growing at a healthy pace ever since it rebounded after briefly falling below 20% year-on-year for two quarters in 2012.TripAdvisor's revenue growth guidance for the full year ranges from the ""high 20s to low 30s,"" which could be interpreted as 25-35%, or 30% (midpoint). TripAdvisor's Q2 2014 results saw YoY revenue growth accelerate significantly, touching 31% for the quarter. Given that the results of TripAdvisor's best quarter (typically Q3 every year) are yet to be announced, the company looks well poised to grow in line with its guidance.Source: AmigobullsTripAdvisor's revenue growth in Q2 2014 was driven partly by its acquisitions, ""Vacation Home Rentals"" and European restaurant bookings service, ""La Fourchette,"" or ""The Fork."" Another driver of revenue growth has been the improvement in click pricing or ""CPC"" (cost-per-click). The rise in CPC is a positive for TripAdvisor and is partly a result of the features it has been adding to improve shopper conversions and ROI's for advertisers.In the second half of 2013, TripAdvisor launched meta-search, a feature that collates bookings data from advertisers and lets users compare options on the site without being diverted to sites individually. The feature helped TripAdvisor improve the quality of leads it passes on to advertisers. More recently the company launched ""Instant Bookings,"" a functionality which allows users to complete the booking within TripAdvisor's mobile app. According to the company, the feature has driven more conversions in Q2 than the meta-search.So far, ""Instant Bookings"" is accessible to mobile traffic only in the US. Over Q3, TripAdvisor was scheduled to roll out the feature to users on desktops and tablets. Mobile traffic accounts for about 50% of TripAdvisor's total traffic, implying that non-mobile platforms hold significant potential. Further, the opportunity is poised to get even bigger as the feature gets rolled out to more geographies.Given that user growth has also been strong at 25% YoY in Q2, there are many reasons to be optimistic about TripAdvisor's revenue growth in the coming quarters.TripAdvisor ProfitabilityTripAdvisor's profit margins have contracted in recent times when compared with the levels prevalent in the past. The net profit margin of 21.7% for FY 2013 marks a consistent decline from 25.5% in FY 2012 and 27.9% in FY 2011. For the first 2 quarters in FY 2014 as well, net margins have been a fair bit lower than they were in the same quarters in FY 2013. It looks likely that this trend will continue, resulting in net margins falling below the 20% mark.In Q2 2014, net margins came in at 21.1%, declining from Q1 levels, owing to spends ($10 million) on TV advertising. TripAdvisor is scheduled to spend an additional $20 million on TV ads in Q3, potentially dragging net margins below 20%. Further, profitability typically gets even lower in Q4 every year for the company.To summarize, though operating and net profit margins were decent at 31% and 21%, respectively, in Q2 2014, a further decline is very likely.TripAdvisor ValuationsAt a stock price of $89.49 a share, TripAdvisor currently trades at PE and PS multiples of 61.6 and 12.2. TripAdvisor is a good company and looks poised to grow. However, current valuations are steep and don't appear to have factored in the declining profitability.Source: AmigobullsAt these valuations, TripAdvisor is a risky bet and could be vulnerable to further corrections in case of a revenue/earnings miss or the emergence of any other negatives."
2244663,23479,2014-05-29T18:22:15-04:00,"TripAdvisor is the world’s largest travel review website and averages more than 250 million unique visitors in a month.In a move to attract more users and better monetize its restaurant traffic it acquired LaFourchette this month for $140 million in an all cash deal.TripAdvisor has a history of acquiring startups, such as SeatGuru, Jetsetter and Niumba, and integrating their services with its own.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is the world’s largest travel review website and averages more than 250 million unique visitors in a month. The company allows users to read reviews on hotels, vacation rental properties and restaurants. In a move to attract more users and better monetize its restaurant traffic it acquired LaFourchette (meaning “The Fork”) this month for $140 million in an all cash deal. LaFourchette is one of the leading Internet and mobile restaurant reservation systems in France and Spain with over 12,000 participating restaurants.LaFourchette generates revenues by selling its online reservation software to restaurants and its APIs to third-party developers for analyzing data to increase a restaurant’s business. The company has already achieved scale in France and Spain, and it turned profitable last year. With the acquisition, TripAdvisor will be looking to strengthen its position in Europe’s restaurant market. Although LaFourchette will be discontinued as a brand, its employees will continue to operate from the company’s offices in Paris and Barcelona.LaFourchette Widens TripAdvisor’s Opportunity In The International Online Restaurant Reservation MarketWe believe that there are four key aspects that TripAdvisor considered before acquiring LaFourchette. First, the former receives over 200 million page views per month from its restaurant traffic. It will be able to provide a better experience to these users by offering a booking service and taking them further down the booking funnel. Second, the scope of growth in the online restaurant reservation category is much bigger internationally than that in TripAdvisor’s domestic market—the U.S. While over 20% of restaurant bookings in the U.S. occur online, the percentage stands at low single-digits in nearly every international market. Third, from the revenue generation perspective, TripAdvisor will be able to better monetize its restaurant traffic by converting many of its users into seated diners. The booking feature will also attract new users and restaurants to its website, presenting an opportunity to exponentially grow restaurant reservation revenues. And fourth, OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) dominates the North American online restaurant reservation market with approximately 23,000 partner restaurants. This will make it an arduous task for TripAdvisor to penetrate the market. Targeting international markets makes more sense in this scenario.TripAdvisor has a history of acquiring startups, such as SeatGuru, Jetsetter and Niumba, and integrating their services with its own. The company not only has considerable investment capital ($319 million as cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2014) but also has the relevant experience and resources to grow LaFourchette into a leader in the European continent. Besides LaFourchette, TripAdvisor made other important acquisitions this month including that of London-based Tripbod—a travel community that connects travelers to local experts, and Vacation Home Rentals—a Massachusetts-based vacation rentals site with over 14,000 listed properties.Disclosure: No positions"
2494155,24580,2014-09-15T02:56:37-04:00,"TripAdvisor has continued with its strong revenue growth in the current fiscal year. Second quarter revenue growth clocked in at 31% year-on-year, or $323 million.TripAdvisor got 73% of its overall revenue during the second quarter from click-based advertising, and 13% from display-based advertising. The rest of the company’s revenue comes mainly from subscriptions.TripAdvisor is lucky in this respect because it’s able to leverage the high-margins revenue it receives from Priceline and Expedia to cover its marketing costs.","TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is the world's largest travel review company. The company was spun-off from Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) , the second largest online travel agency, or OTA, after Priceline (PCLN), in 2011, and has become so successful that it has overtaken Expedia's market cap. TripAdvisor shares had sold off by a huge 30% margin at one point this year, due to valuation concerns. The shares have recovered from their slump and gained 37% year-to-date, and still remain pricey trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 13.5. Yelp (NYSE:YELP), another review site, trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 19.4.Although TripAdvisor's pricey shares are a cause for concern, there are several reasons why the company is likely to maintain strong growth for the next 3-4 years.Good Revenue ModelTripAdvisor has continued with its strong revenue growth in the current fiscal year. In the first quarter, revenue grew 22% year-on-year to $281 million, while in the second quarter, revenue growth clocked in at 31% year-on-year, or $323 million. TripAdvisor's Achilles Heel, however, remains its net income which was up 10% in the first quarter to $0.47 per diluted share while in the second quarter, it grew only 1% year-on-year to $0.47. TripAdvisor's net income growth is below the average for the Internet & Catalog Retail industry.TripAdvisor's reliable revenue model is perhaps one of the reasons why it's so popular with investors. TripAdvisor is basically a travel review site where users go post their reviews of hotels they have stayed at, or read reviews by other travelers to help them make decisions about where to stay. Once a user is satisfied with the reviews about their hotel of choice, they can then click through to OTAs such as Expedia and Priceline and do their booking. TripAdvisor, therefore, acts as facilitator for these OTAs.More than 1.25 billion travelers paid a visit to TripAdvisor's website during H1 2014. Those are a lot of travelers, and OTAs such as Priceline and Expedia have noticed this and acted accordingly. These OTAs, as well as other travel companies, pay TripAdvisor a fee to place their ads on its site. TripAdvisor got 73% of its overall revenue during the second quarter from click-based advertising, and 13% from display-based advertising. The rest of the company's revenue comes mainly from subscriptions.Priceline and Expedia account for about 47% of TripAdvisor's revenue. While this at first might not look like an attractive proposition due to the risk of losing a huge percentage of its revenue should one of these OTAs end its relationship with the company, the fact of the matter is that this is very unlikely to happen. TripAdvisor competes against other travel review sites such as Zoover, Trivago, VibeAgent, TravelPost, Google Places, and others. Although there are no hard figures about the company's market share yet, it's quite likely north of 60% with the rest being heavily fragmented among many smaller players. It would be extremely unlikely that these OTAs would ditch TripAdvisor to work with a much smaller review site, since this would very likely result in a huge and immediate impact on their topline. TripAdvisor continues to be a hot favorite with travelers because the site has a great user experience, and is not plagued so much by worries about reviews being manipulated. TripAdvisor came under close scrutiny by the Advertising Stanadards Agency (NYSE:ASA) in 2011 to determine whether the reviews on the site are authentic and was later cleared. The company claims that 98% of its users trust the site.The huge number of reviews on TripAdvisor gives it a big leg over its competition. Users tend to trust a review site that has, say 50-60 reviews on a hotel, than one with say 5-10 reviews. TripAdvisor has accumulated more than 170 million reviews on more than 4.2 million places to stay on its site. The more people continue using TripAdvisor to post their travel reviews (either favorable ones or posting their gripes) the stronger and more valuable the sites content becomes, and the more people are likely to use it than other rival sites.The company is profitableTripAdvisor is solidly profitable, while other review companies such as Yelp and Angie's List continue to struggle with mounting losses. Yelp receives an impressive amount of unique visitors to its site-about 132 million monthly unique visitors, or about 64% of TripAdvisor's 208 million visitors per month. Yet, Yelp's revenue in the second quarter was only $88.8 million, or just 27% of TripAdvisor's revenue, indicating that the company could be having a problem monetizing its content.Yelp's problem stems from the fact that it derives its income almost solely from SMBs, many of which run on shoe string budgets. Once a business is reviewed on Yelp, it can claim its ad. Claiming is the process by which the business responds to the reviews directed at it. Yelp tries to sell ad space to businesses that claim their ads. Although Yelp has about 60 million listed businesses, less than 2 million have claimed their listing, out of which only around 70,000 are active advertisers.Travel Review companies spend a large percentage of their revenue on sales and marketing functions, on the premise that once they build a huge following then the profits will naturally follow later. For many review companies, however, revenue has kept growing at a healthy clip while the profits have not been forthcoming. TripAdvisor spends about 40% of its revenue on sales and marketing expenses while Yelp spends about 50% of revenue on marketing functions. Both Yelp and Angie's List have continued to be impinged by their high marketing expenses and have as a result remained in the red. Angie's List has been in business for more than 20 years and has never once turned a profit.TripAdvisor is lucky in this respect because it's able to leverage the high-margins revenue it receives from Priceline and Expedia to cover its marketing costs. Without this revenue component, TripAdvisor would likewise be in the red.ConclusionTripAdvisor is very likely to maintain its wide-moat advantage in the travel review business, and this will help the company to maintain strong relationships with deep-pocketed customers and continue growing. The shares currently look expensive, and it might be a good idea to wait for a dip of around 10%-15% before increasing your position."
2300155,55362,2014-07-05T16:00:37-04:00,,"My latest position is short TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). Yes I'm once again going against a very ""trendy"" tech giant, but as with LinkedIn, I think I have some very good reasons to believe this is a great short at its current price.I'm not going to copy and paste some general explanations about the company, as I assume most of you know what it is and the rest can simply check Tripadvisor.com, Wikipedia, or any other source the web offers.What I am going to do is give a short overview of the company's business model, and current different revenue streams, which are currently divided to three groups in the company's financial statements:While Trip does not reveal the revenue distribution between each of those sub-segments, we know that as a whole they generated $51M, $81M and $130M in 2011, 2012 & 2013, respectively.The table below presents growth rates of the different segments for the last couple of years, as well as comparable data from the Q1/2014 results.So, it's pretty clear that Trip is basically growing at a somewhat steady pace of 20%-25% for the last couple of years, and mitigating its decline in click-based ad growth with an accelerated growth in display ads & the 3rd segment.Growing 20%-25% for an extremely profitable company like Trip is far from bad, but what kind of revenue multiple should it imply?Current Enterprise Value to LTM revenue multiple stands at 14.6, which means Trip's Market Cap is $14.5B. I'd argue that the inflated market cap / revenue multiple reflects a lot of hope in the aforementioned ""Other revenue"" segment, whose growth rates are above 50% and are actually on the rise recently.This segment is indeed entitled to a higher revenue multiple than Trip's ""traditional"" revenue streams (click & display ads), but it currently accounts for such a low percentage of the company's total revenue that it would take 5 years at an astonishing 50% annual growth rate (while display & click revenue stands still) for it to equal 50% of the company's total revenue.While this ""3rd segment's"" future growth rates are a mystery and might eventually turn out to be very high indeed, I think it's highly unlikely that Trip will be able to increase or even maintain the traditional display & click ads revenue in the future. Looking at the combined segment growth rates in the last five quarters, I think it's safe to say that the best-case-scenario for click & display ads' growth rates is to remain flat and hover around 20% in the near future.Unlike a lot of other tech ""high-flyers"", TripAdvisor is extremely profitable, which also has a major part in its current market valuation. Now, this may be a good time to raise the fact that our current tech ""mini-bubble"" might be confusing sometimes, as we keep hearing why profitability doesn't matter at the rapid growth stage (i.e LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.), and yet investors seem to dig Trip Advisor's high profit margins.I'm all for profitable companies and huge margins, and Trip really seems to have a great business model. But the DCFs that somehow try to justify its current valuation not only claim that EBITDA margins will remain the same, but actually increase even further towards the 50% area.Judging from the businesses that I've actually seen before that lasted for more than a couple of years, I find it hard to believe EBITDA margins of around 50% are maintainable in any industry, and would love to hear some contradicting examples. Growing competition will surely demand more marketing expenses and working hands in the near future, and the historical trend shows pretty clearly that margins are actually eroding, not improving.With net margin approaching a (still great) 20% rate, and revenue growth's best-case-scenario is to hover around 25% for a few more years before turning lower, I still think TripAdvisor is actually a very good company, but see no reason for it to trade above 20-25 times LTM net income, which implies a market cap of $4B-$5B, or about 28%-35% of its current market cap.Disclosure: The author is short TRIP.

2299215,65003,2014-07-03T16:45:20-04:00,"Shares of TripAdvisor have risen nearly 150% over the past 2 years.TripAdvisor accounts for more than 10% of all global traffic to travel websites.Several catalysts exist, but fair value is approximately 15% lower from the current prices.","COMPANY OVERVIEW:TripAdvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) is an online travel company that provides customers across the world access to the reviews and opinions of millions of fellow travelers via its global online community. Through its branded websites, which include tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the website in 39 countries (including China under daodao.com), TRIP collects reviews and opinions about destinations, accommodations (hotels, B&Bs, specialty lodging, vacation rentals, etc.), restaurants and activities throughout the world. With over 260 million monthly unique visitors to its branded websites, TRIP features over 150 million reviews and opinions on more than 810,000 hotels and accommodations and approximately 600,000 vacation rentals, as well as more than 2.2 million restaurants and 420,000 attractions in 140,000 destinations across the globe. Further, more than just reviews, TripAdvisor's platform also enables consumers to book hotels, vacation rentals, airline tickets, vacation packages, destination services and cruises through its websites.The company primarily generates revenue from the sale of advertising through click-based advertising (priced on a cost-per-click, or CPC, basis) and display-based advertising (priced on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis), which accounted for roughly 74% and 13% of total revenue, respectively in 2013. The remaining percentage of revenue is generated through a combination of subscription-based services, allowing users to book room nights on its transactional sites, and other revenue such as content licensing.INDUSTRY AND COMPETITION:The market for online travel services is intensely competitive, subject to the current macroeconomic environment and rapidly changing mostly due to technological shifts such as mobile. In general, TRIP faces competition for users, advertisers and travel reviews. Specifically, TRIP competes directly with other online travel websites, such as Expedia and Priceline and their subsidiaries (Trivago and Kayak, respectively), as well as Yelp. In addition, the travel review industry has grown increasingly competitive in recent years as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, etc.) have expanded their reach while amassing travel-related resources, information and reviews.Furthermore, TRIP also faces competition from hotel companies, airlines and rental car companies - many of whom have their own websites - which the company expects will increase over time, as these other companies may offer better rates, availability and/or additional features/amenities through their own reservation service. TripAdvisor also faces competition from travel agencies, wholesalers and travel operators, as well as operators of travel industry reservation databases, such as Galileo, Travelport, Amadeus and Sabre. Lastly, its vacation rental business also faces competition from several companies including, but not limited to, HomeAway and Airbnb.Meanwhile, changing technology habits - primarily via mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets - will increasingly play a role in the future as consumers conduct travel research and planning using those devices. As such, the company plans to continue to invest in this and other areas of growth going forward. By way of example, as of the end of Q1 2014, aggregate downloads of the company's TripAdvisor, City Guides, SeatGuru, Jetsetter and GateGuru mobile apps reached more than 100 million, with average monthly unique visitors via smartphone and tablet devices growing 83% year-over-year (YoY) from 62 million to 115 million.Additionally, TripAdvisor and the health of the worldwide travel industry as a whole are affected by the overall state of the global economy. During economic downturns - as witnessed during the Great Recession - travel expenditures were adversely impacted. As a result, any similar economic downturns in the future could lead to a reduction in business and personal travel. Further, given TripAdvisor's global presence, some areas may be more affected than others (i.e. the recovery in Europe has lagged the recovery in the US).FINANCIALS:TripAdvisor has experienced favorable financial results over the last several years, helped by a recovering global economy in a growing industry fueled by increasing global demand. On average, the company has grown revenue 26.2% annually over the last five years, driven by gains in each of its product segments (click-based advertising, display-based advertising and subscription, transaction and other). Although the percentage of revenue derived from click-based advertising has slightly decreased over the last three years, it still accounted for the majority of total revenue at 73.7% in 2013 (as well as in Q1 2014). Over the same time period, display-based advertising has hovered near 13%, while subscription, transaction and other has increased from 8% in 2011 to about 14% in 2013.The company has identified two main drivers of its click-based advertising revenue - growth in monthly unique hotel shoppers (a sub-segment of total traffic growth) and revenue per hotel shopper (how effective TRIP is in monetizing hotel shoppers). For the year ended December 31, 2013, the number of hotel shoppers increased 36% YoY, compared to an increase of 32% YoY for the year ended December 31, 2012. Meanwhile, revenue per hotel shopper decreased 13% YoY for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to a decrease of 8% YoY as of December 31, 2012.Furthermore, in the three months ending March 31, 2014, the number of hotel shoppers increased 14%, while revenue per hotel shopper increased 1%. The company did point out a couple of factors influencing the somewhat weak YoY comparisons in the Q1 2014 and Q1 2013 numbers. Specifically, the company cited high hotel shopper growth from search engine optimization (SEO) in late 2012 and Q1 2013 as the reason for the deceleration to only 14% in Q1 2014, as well as the implementation of hotel metasearch in June 2013 (additional details below), which has resulted in higher CPC pricing due to higher-quality clicks (with regard to revenue per hotel shopper).Among display-based advertising, the growth in the number of impressions (i.e. how many times an ad is displayed on its site) and the cost per thousand impressions (""CPM"") are the two main drivers of revenue in this segment. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the number of impressions sold increased 34% YoY vs. a 6% YoY gain for the year ended December 31, 2012. Meanwhile, pricing decreased 5% YoY as of December 31, 2013 vs. a 1% increase YoY for the year ended December 31, 2012. In addition, for the three months ended March 31, 2014, the number of impressions sold increased 30% while pricing decreased 1%.However, amid the company's growth in revenue, margins - primarily operating and EBITDA margins - have declined for the past four years due to a variety of factors. For example, cost of revenue increased primarily due to increased data center costs driven by higher site traffic, as well as increased merchant credit card fees from additional costs related to TRIP's business acquisitions in 2013. Additionally, direct selling and marketing costs have increased mainly due to increased search engine marketing costs and other advertising costs (i.e. offline advertising). Personnel and overhead costs have also increased over the years, fueled by an increasing headcount related to the company's international expansion and from recent business acquisitions. Further, costs related to technology improvements have increased recently as well, in an effort to enhance site features and extend the company's presence on smartphone and tablet platforms.In addition, despite the fact that TRIP competes with Expedia, the company does derive a substantial portion of its revenue via a partnership with Expedia. In fact, TRIP received 23% of its total revenue from Expedia in 2013. However, that amount is down from almost 40% in 2009, when it was still owned by Expedia.Moreover, in looking at TRIP's revenue breakdown by geographic location, it appears as though the biggest increases in revenue (by percentage) have occurred in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions, while the North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions have both accounted for a smaller percentage of overall revenue. Although this will inevitably increase the company's foreign currency risk, these higher-growth regions should help drive revenue growth and customer engagement going forward.Source: TRIP Form 10-K, 31 December 2013Meanwhile, the company exhibits a strong balance sheet, with little debt and a sufficient (and growing) cash position. As of March 31, 2014, TRIP had approximately $745 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities - an increase of roughly 11% YoY - of which $319 million was held in cash and money market funds. In addition, the company has posted positive and increasing free cash flow (FCF) for the last five years at an average rate of about 27%.VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION:Using an FCF-based DCF model based on the assumptions below, I estimate shares of TRIP are worth approximately $94.17. At their current price around $110, that represents a nearly 15% premium to my one-year price target, and serves as the basis for my HOLD recommendation. Considering the model's sensitivity to the inputs - specifically the terminal FCF growth rate - I have included a sensitivity analysis below. Even when using an 8% terminal FCF growth rate, it only results in a valuation of $116.49 - roughly a 5% gain from current prices. In addition, the FCF growth rate used in years 1-3 is based on the company's five-year average return on equity (ROE), while the 16% growth rate used in years 4 and 5 represent a 50% decline, assuming increasing costs and competition.Sensitivity AnalysisWACCVALUATION METRICS RELATIVE TO PEERS:Also contributing to my HOLD recommendation is the fact that shares of TRIP appear overvalued on a variety of valuation metrics when compared to its peers and its industry (internet information providers). Currently, shares of TRIP are trading at a P/E of 76, a P/S ratio of 15.5, a P/B ratio of 16.3 and a whopping 48.5 EV/EBITDA ratio.RISKS TO RECOMMENDATION:At current levels, shares of TRIP appear priced for perfection, given their lofty valuation metrics and nearly 15% departure from fair value. While the company is executing well on most fronts, its place within a cyclical industry facing increasing competition could keep its shares in check in the short term. The company has already experienced increasing costs associated with additional marketing and offline advertising, in an effort to stave off competition. Also, increased costs associated with growing its mobile offerings via smartphones and tablets will continue to impact the company as the shift towards mobile intensifies. As a result of these increased costs, the declining margins the company has experienced recently - particularly in operating and EBITDA margins - are expected to continue, likely hurting the bottom line. Further, as competition intensifies, the company is subject to declining page views, which would likely translate into lower advertising revenue.CATALYSTS:Although shares appear overvalued for the time being, given the nearly 40% rise in the company's stock since the beginning of this year, there are a few catalysts that could push shares higher in the future. For example, the company announced that during Q4 2013, its transition to metasearch (aggregating search engine and database information so travelers can find the best deals in one place) achieved revenue neutrality - the point at which the new product (i.e. metasearch) generates revenue at the same level the previous model did. Initially, the transition to metasearch resulted in fewer clicks, thus generating less click-based advertising revenue. However, now with metasearch, these clicks are higher-quality as more bookings are done by users, enabling the company to raise its per-click ad rates, and ultimately increasing its total revenue.In addition, TRIP is likely to see future growth as the company continues to expand its user base and increase its subscription, transaction and other business lines through its recent acquisitions, which included a total of seven over the last 18 months. Among its biggest purchases over that time was of European restaurant service La Fourchette for $140 million in May 2014, which will give TRIP access to 24,000 restaurant partners in Europe. La Fourchette (""The Fork"") is the leading online and mobile reservation platform for restaurants in France and Spain, and turned profitable last year. In a move that actually preceded PCLN's purchase of OpenTable, TRIP's purchase of La Fourchette will enable the company to expand further into the international market, where there is more growth potential in the online restaurant reservation category. For example, while approximately 20% of existing restaurant reservations in the US are made online, that number is in the single digits in the international market.Moreover, the company's six other acquisitions made in 2013, which totaled roughly $35 million, include a variety of services, all meant to help fuel future growth. These acquisitions include TinyPost (a photo app that allows users to embed text over photos and turn them into stories); Jetsetter (a members-only private sale site for hotel bookings); CruiseWise (a cruise research and planning site); Niumba (a Spain-based vacation rental site); GateGuru (a mobile app with flight and airport information from around the world); and Oyster (a hotel review website with expert reviews and hotel photos from over 150 cities worldwide).Furthermore, as the use of smartphones and tablets continues to increase - particularly in international and emerging markets - the company is looking to capitalize on the increasing demand for mobile travel booking. As such, TRIP recently announced that it will offer instant booking on its mobile app and the mobile version of its website, in an effort to grow its user base and increase its conversion rates.Lastly, the company's $250 million share repurchase program - announced in February 2013 - could provide an additional lift to shares in the future, as the company still has approximately $105 million remaining under this program with no expiration date.BOTTOM LINE:In yet another example of a spin-off outperforming its parent, TripAdvisor has enjoyed enormous success since splitting off from Expedia in December 2011. Although shares currently appear overvalued, the management team has proven it is more than capable and continues to focus on increasing its total user base through international expansion and improvement in its mobile offerings. Increasing competition and its lofty valuation, however, will likely keep shares in check in the near term, until the catalysts discussed materialize further. As such, I maintain a HOLD rating and a one-year price target of $94.17.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Users make travel decisions based on the site's content and, when they click through to actual travel agencies like Expedia and Priceline (PCLN), those companies pay TripAdvisor a fee. The travel agencies also buy banner ads on TripAdvisor. The clicks and banner ads - along with some subscription services - added up to total 2013 revenue of $944.7 million. And unlike Yelp, TripAdvisor is solidly profitable, with net income last year of $205.4 million.The more people post reviews, the stronger the content, the more online travel agencies are compelled to buy click and banner ads.But wait just a minute. TripAdvisor, after its rapid advance, commands a market cap of $13.2 billion. And it trades at a forward forward PE ratio of more than twice that of Priceline and Expedia.TRIP PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsDoes that make any sense? Conceptually, here's one argument for a richer TripAdvisor multiple: it's a media company, essentially, and its enormous storehouse of reviews are valuable assets - and represent a moat to potential competitors entering the space. The company's sites attracted 260 million unique visitors monthly during 2013, an 11% market share in online travel. TripAdvisor calls itself the world's largest travel website.While an elegant technical advance in online travel purchasing could supplant Priceline and Expedia, the disruptor would still likely need TripAdvisor to steer consumers toward its site; Priceline and Expedia together account for 47% of TripAdvisor's revenue.It's a good argument, but far from a guarantee of sustainable competition advantage, at least to the extent of justifying paying 51 times forward earnings for TripAdvisor stock. What's more, Priceline's margins are widening as it grows, showing true economies of scale. TripAdvisor's margins suggest either a temporary need to invest heavily or a business that gets harder as it gets bigger.TRIP Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsTripAdvisor's sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue have been expanding - to 39% last year from 32.8% two years earlier. True, Expedia and Priceline are also having to spend more on search ads and other advertising to generate business, as the industry becomes more competitive. But Priceline stock seems attractive in particular because, as we wrote earlier, it operates more efficiently than competitors and its rate of growth has been especially impressive.That doesn't mean TripAdvisor is a candidate to be shorted. Its revenue growth and strong market position have won it many fans, and betting against them could be ruinous.TRIP Percent of Shares Outstanding Short data by YChartsBut in a market correction, a company like Priceline - trading at a more modest multiple, growing a bit faster and enjoying margin expansion - seems a better bet to hang onto its value.Jeff Bailey, The Editor of YCharts, is a former reporter, editor and columnist at the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.Disclosure: None"
2065183,22675,2014-03-04T04:00:13-05:00,,"Last week, I did an in-depth analysis of TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) as a long-term play and I really liked what I saw. From my perspective, TRIP was able to build an incredibly strong brand, an unmatched travel community that is increasingly the starting point for travelers that are looking for information about destinations, hotels, etc. Two big conclusions were that TRIP needed to:- Strengthen its ""lock-in""- Strengthen the relationships with its partners around the worldThat got me thinking about ways to get there and an obvious way seemed to be acquiring the right type of company. While not perfect, I think OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) would be a great candidate to help take TRIP to the next level.How OpenTable Would Help- Daily Usage: One challenge that TripAdvisor faces is how to keep its visitors active throughout the year. Most of us only have a few weeks of vacations per year and we might spend a month or two planning each one. OpenTable is used much more frequently.- While TripAdvisor does have restaurant listings and reviews, there is no doubt that OpenTable is the leader in this segment, far above everyone else. Such a move would help consolidate that lead as TRIP's international presence would be key in helping OpenTable expand to international markets where it has experienced slower growth than you'd expect. Not only does TRIP have actual offices and staff but it also has experience in dealing with businesses all around the world.When looking at OpenTable's revenue breakdown, it's striking how poorly it has done outside the US:*Data from OpenTable's financial statements- Integration: As convinced as I am that this move would make a sense for both players, I'm not exactly certain how TripAdvisor would or should integrate OpenTable. Both have strong brands, different types of users and I can't imagine simply folding OpenTable into TRIP. From a user standpoint, I'd likely keep both the same even though that does mean competing together in terms of restaurant reviews. One thing that I think could be merged is back-end of these websites, or the interface that businesses use to manage inventory, answer reviews, advertise their properties, etc. It would help bring in more businesses to a single platform and give them incentives to be more active.Credit: YCharts.comPricingBig deals are always risky to some extent. OpenTable would likely come at a price between $2-2.5B. That would be almost a fifth of TRIP's value which is very significant. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) only had to dish out about 10% of its value for its recent WhatsApp acquisition but still came under criticism for risking too much.Not only is the cost involved significant but on a relative value, OpenTable is a fairly expensive buy. It currently trades at a 56 P/E and a 44 forward P/E based off Bloomberg estimates. TRIP would need to offer a premium over that price to get the deal done.Buying More Than A BusinessI think it's important though to keep in mind that OpenTable would likely be more valuable to TRIP than to any other player out there. It wouldn't only be buying a fast-growing business that complements its own mission. It would also be getting expertise and infrastructure that OPEN has been deploying for several years now.It would also provide additional leverage in getting restaurants around the world to deal with the clearly dominant platform for reviews, reservations, etc.Is it a no-brainer? No, I wouldn't go that far when you're talking about a company that is trading at a 55 P/E with moderate growth. Looking at the details though, I think this move would be the right one for TripAdvisor.Disclosure: I am long TRIP. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
2064303,23479,2014-03-03T16:44:57-05:00,,"TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) said during its most recent earnings call that its meta-display feature approached revenue neutrality in December last year. [1] Launched in Q4 2012, the meta feature displays room prices and availability from top advertisers, such as Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN), on TripAdvisor's website. The transition to this new feature had negatively impacted bidding activity from many advertisers in the past few quarters, which weighed on TripAdvisor's top-line growth. We are encouraged by the recent development and expect the company to benefit as the platform grows its scale. We have a $83 price estimate for TripAdvisor's stock, about 15% lower than its market price.How Does The Feature Exactly Affect Bidding By Advertisers?Earlier, users had to click through from TripAdvisor's site to an advertiser's website in order to view hotel pricing and availability information. Meta-display collates and displays this information from top advertisers on its own website. Although this has lowered the number of leads sent by TripAdvisor to its advertisers, the leads are more qualified and have better conversion rates as travelers are now more likely to click on the advertiser's link for booking rather than just seeking information.The better quality leads have allowed TripAdvisor to increase its advertising rates. However, the transition took time. The meta-display platform initially was unable to achieve revenue neutrality as fewer leads were being sent to advertisers than before. Advertisers were wary of the transition to meta display, and therefore, were conservative when bidding on the new platform. The meta transition dragged down TripAdvisor's top-line by approximately 3%-5% in Q1 2013. The impact was more magnified in Q2 and Q3 at 6%-9% and 9%-12%, respectively, due to a broader roll-out of the feature across PCs and tablets.Meta Will Help Enhance User Base And Revenue Per Page ViewMeta achieved revenue neutrality in the December quarter through a combination of higher ad pricing and better conversion rates. Pricing improved through the fourth quarter as competition among advertisers to gain visibility in the meta platform lifted bids, while conversion rates improved as more users returned to make purchases. [1] We expect this trend to continue going forward.TripAdvisor's vast user base is its key growth driver as it attracts many advertisers. Monthly unique visitors to the company's websites grew by 50% year-on-year in Q4 to 260 million. [1] We believe that the meta platform will help TripAdvisor to further expand its user base as it enhances overall user experience by addressing queries on a single page.Meta will also provide a boost to the ad revenue earned by TripAdvisor per page view as users start making more purchases and competition on meta heats up further. Furthermore, the feature will help the company to compete more effectively with Priceline's Kayak and Expedia's Trivago, the meta-search market leaders in the U.S. and Europe, respectively.Disclosure: No positions."

Click-based advertising revenue increased by 16% year-on-year and accounted for 74% of total revenues. The business benefited as TripAdvisor's meta-display platform witnessed an increase in pricing and conversion rates. We will talk about meta in detail in this article. [1]Adjusted EBITDA growth also accelerated to 135% sequentially as total expenses decreased to 57% of revenue from 75%, primarily due to the timing of TripAdvisor's TV advertisements. The company began investing into new TV campaigns recently and therefore it expects to incur the bulk of its selling and marketing expenses for the year in Q2 and Q3.Citing the positive developments that occurred in the first quarter, TripAdvisor raised its guidance for top-line growth for the year from mid-20s to high 20s to low 30s. However, the forecast does not incorporate any meaningful upside from future increases in pricing and conversion rates. It also does not include the effect that its new ad campaigns will have on the traffic. This means that revenues could increase beyond the management's expectations.We are in the process of updating our $83 price estimate for TripAdvisor, based on the quarterly results that were recently announced.Pricing and Conversion Improvement On Meta-Search Is EncouragingEarlier, TripAdvisor's users had to click through to an advertiser's website in order to view hotel pricing and availability information. The meta platform allows users to do all the comparison-based shopping on TripAdvisor's website itself since it collates and displays this information from top advertisers. Although this has lowered the number of leads sent by TripAdvisor to its advertisers, the leads are more qualified and have better conversion rates, as travelers are now more likely to click on the advertiser's link for booking rather than just seeking information.The better quality leads allowed TripAdvisor to increase its advertising rates. Despite this, the meta platform was unable to achieve revenue neutrality until Q3, as fewer leads were being sent to advertisers than before. Advertisers were wary of the transition to meta-display, and therefore, were conservative when bidding on the new platform. The feature approached revenue neutrality in December last year through a combination of higher ad pricing and better conversion rates. Pricing improved through Q1 2014 as competition among advertisers to gain visibility in the meta platform lifted bids, while conversion rates improved as more users returned to make purchases.The increase in prices and conversion rates helped accelerate revenue per hotel shopper growth from -19% and -9% in Q3 and Q4 2013 respectively to +1% in Q1 2014. [1] We expect further acceleration as the meta platform grows in scale.Direct Bookings Launched On Apps And Mobile WebsitesUsing TripAdvisor's app was cumbersome for users until October last year, as they had to click on advertisers' links to see details and complete the booking process. The company launched native apps for Android and iOS devices to reduce this friction. The re-launched apps allowed in-app navigation by keeping the booking experience restricted within TripAdvisor's app instead of launching new advertiser windows in a mobile browser. [2]Although this enhanced the interface, users continued to struggle when they wanted to move back and forth between advertisers' and TripAdvisor's content. The problem was more prominent in smartphones than other devices due to the smaller size of the screen. Therefore, the company began taking direct bookings on its Android and iOS apps and its mobile site, this quarter. This new feature is called Instant Booking. It enhances the user's experience by completing the booking process on TripAdvisor itself. It handles all aspects of the booking process from selecting a room to inputting the personal and credit details, thus offering a frictionless booking experience. [1]Instant booking is currently only available to 10% of the U.S. traffic. It is expected to reach 100% of the smartphone users in TripAdvisor's most important markets by the end of this quarter. The company is designing similar versions for desktops and tablets. We think that Instant Booking will help the company to improve smartphone monetization levels. According to the latest data available, TripAdvisor's smartphone monetization is less than 20% of that on desktops even though mobile traffic accounts for 47% of total traffic and is growing much faster than desktop traffic.Disclosure: No positions."
2052993,22675,2014-02-27T04:51:55-05:00,,"The Story So far….TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) was founded in 2000, purchased by IAC Interactive (IACI) and later spun out with Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) a few months later. However, it wasn't until the end of 2011 that the company was spun out and became independent. I've argued that TRIP was one of the top social web plays, and after doing my research and looking at the latest earnings and calls transcript, I'm strongly considering a longer term speculative position. First, let's take a look at Tripadvisor's metrics since its debut.Most of the data points were provided over time by TripAdvisor in its press releases, financial statements and interviews done by the CEO.Clearly, traffic is exploding these days and I'd argue that this is actually underestimating the recent growth. Why? Because like most other web properties, an increasing portion of TRIP's traffic is going through its mobile apps which are not included in Comscore rankings for example.This is a big point of emphasis by TripAdvisor, and rightfully so, as it gives a very good estimate of the activity level by its members, the community and in the end it's the #1 reason why TripAdvisor is consistently ranked #1 in terms of travel related websites.Revenues are clearly climbing quickly, but I'd argue that the explosion in terms of traffic and reviews that we've seen will also translate into exploding revenues in the coming years.Financial information for 2008 and 2009 was only provided on an annual basis, I did estimates of the quarterly breakdown based off of the historical season impact on TRIP's financials.One of the big reasons why I strongly believe in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is because of their ecosystems. They have a lock-in effect that makes it very difficult for challengers to catch up. I'd argue that while TRIP is not quite there yet, it is making strong progress. If you think about it, Apple owns an ecosystem where it stands in the middle of iphone owners and content providers:TripAdvisor is in the process of creating a similar relationship between travelers all around the world and the hotels, airlines, attractions, etc. Here is what it would look like:This is a CRITICAL part of my value analysis. The difference between a useful site that fades over time as competitors with new features come and those that remain relevant is mostly all about the lock-in effect. I've argued that even though new, ""cool"" apps have been created and gained momentum, Facebook remains the ""default"" and will remain so for the foreseeable future. TRIP needs to accomplish that by:I think TRIP is doing exceptionally in all 3 phases:It's certainly interesting to see how TRIP was built on top of Facebook Connect which has made it much easier to get members to sign up, connect with their friends, etc. So yes, it's certainly dangerous for Facebook to be built on top of another ecosystem and you could certainly say that FB is in a better position. Don't get me wrong, FB is a great investment, but I do think that TRIP is positioning itself very well to build its own strong community. I also like how TRIP has been more vocal about its plans to go beyond advertising which I've been hoping Facebook would do at some point.As you'd expect, TripAdvisor started off as an advertising-based model and remains to this day mostly based off of that. It was the most logical step and was mostly done through display (CPM) and per click (CPC) ads. While I do think those models are there to stay, there is clearly something much bigger being worked on. The existing business accounts are able to get some type of subscription based services and I'd imagine that over time, TRIP will make it easier for the companies to advertise on the network which could increase significantly the number of advertisers bidding on its ad space.Over time, it could also help businesses take reservations, process payments, etc. This would most likely be geared towards smaller businesses but those have significant business in the travel world. Just think of what OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) is starting to do with restaurant reservations (going beyond reviews to reservations and even payment processing)I think that over time, TripAdvisor will be able to generate significantly more per user. In 2013, the company had revenues of $945M with over 2B unique visitors, coming down to an almost insulting $0.47/visitor. The company has been (rightfully so) focused on growth and expanding its reach so far, but I'd expect the focus on revenues to increase significantly in the coming 3-5 years. According to TheInformation.com, revenues/user are between $5-7 for Facebook, LinkedIn (LNKD) and even Yahoo (YHOO). I can't think of a reason why TRIP could not match that.When I look at comparables in terms of potential visitor profile, I'd probably use a benchmark such as LNKD. Why?That would make TRIP massively undervalued at this point. It would have been nice to get this strong feeling a year ago at a cheaper price but it's far from too late in my opinion. I will likely take a long term speculative position in the near future… I will keep you posted but I'd love to hear your thoughts.,Disclosure: Long Tripadvisor (TRIP), Long Facebook (FB)"
2005231,23479,2014-02-07T16:57:09-05:00,,"TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is slated to release its earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year 2013 Tuesday, February 11. The world’s largest travel review company posted $255 million in revenue in Q3, up by 20% compared to the year-ago period. Click-based advertising accounted for 74% of total revenue and display-based advertising accounted for 12% of total revenue. The remainder came from subscriptions, transactions and other sources. Adjusted operating profit fell by 2% year-on-year to $104 million in the third quarter, as TripAdvisor tested and rolled out its new ad campaign in the U.S. However, the bulk of TripAdvisor’s TV marketing spend shifted to Q4 as the company began targeting international markets near the end of Q3. Based on this, we expect fourth quarter adjusted operating profit to also come lower than the year-ago period.We will update our current price estimate of $80 for TripAdvisor’s stock after the Q4 2013 results are announced.Negative Impact Of Meta-Display Transition On Top Line To Fade Away SoonEarlier, users had to click through to an advertiser’s website in order to view hotel pricing and availability information. TripAdvisor launched a new meta feature in Q4 2012 that collates and displays this information from top advertisers on its own website. Although this has lowered the number of leads sent by TripAdvisor to its advertisers, the leads are more qualified and have better conversion rates, as travelers are now more probable to click on the advertiser’s link for booking rather than just seeking information.Despite the search enhancement, conversion rate improvement in Q3 was below TripAdvisor’s expectations. The company suffered the worst quarterly impact of its meta-display transition in the quarter since the launch of the platform. Growth in click-based advertising revenue decelerated to 13% year-on-year, from 21% in Q2 and 24% in Q1. The management attributed this to leakages in the meta system, which results from users who check pricing and availability information on TripAdvisor, but do not click on to advertiser websites to make bookings. Instead, they directly visit the advertiser’s website to complete their bookings. Hence, the search could effectively convert into a transaction, but TripAdvisor fails to get due credit because users bypass the link.TripAdvisor’s management had earlier expected the meta platform to approach revenue neutrality by the end of 2013. However, during the Q3 earnings call it lowered the full year guidance for click-based ad revenue growth to mid to high-teens, from high-teens to low 20s, suggesting that revenue parity could be delayed by a few quarters. Nevertheless, meta-display enhances the overall user experience by addressing queries on a single page. We believe the feature will help the company to expand its user base, which is its key growth driver. It will also drive up the volume of page views per visitor, since users will spend more time on TripAdvisor. Further, the feature will help the company to compete against Priceline’s (PCLN) Kayak and Expedia’s (NASDAQ:EXPE) Trivago, the meta search market leaders in the U.S. and Europe respectively.Subscription And Related Revenue To Continue Its Growth TrajectoryTripAdvisor introduced a new transaction-based model in Q1 that is different from the old subscription model, under which properties paid a subscription fee to TripAdvisor for business listing. Now, properties are free to list but they pay on a per transaction basis, which has resulted in a greater number of businesses listing themselves. TripAdvisor’s subscription, transaction and other revenue increased by 68% year-on-year in Q3 to $35 million. The company expects to see continued sales productivity in business listings and higher vacation rentals due to the introduction of the offering.TripAdvisor also launched a new TripConnect platform in early Q4 that allows small and independent hotels to participate in meta-search. The option to participate in meta-search was previously available only to large hotel chains, and online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Priceline and Expedia. TripConnect offers property owners the chance to bypass OTAs and generate bookings through their own website, thereby saving time on marketing efforts, reducing commissions paid to OTAs and helping them better understand guests’ perception about their property through post-stay reviews.To participate in TripConnect hotels must subscribe to TripAdvisor Business Listings. A total of 210 Internet booking engines covering 135,000 properties worldwide had signed up for TripConnect before its launch, better than the company’s expectations. Close to 90% of these committed 210 Internet booking engines had opted for the premium offering. We expect more property owners to try out this new auction platform since TripAdvisor’s vast reach is attractive to hoteliers.Disclosure: No positions"
2009971,23625,2014-02-11T02:16:38-05:00,,"TripAdvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) is set to report FQ4 2013 earnings after the market closes on Tuesday, February 11th. TripAdvisor is a website that provides travel related information and content. Within the past year, TripAdvisor has switched to a hotel metasearch model. This means that TRIP now sends its users' searches to several other search engines and/or databases to return the best possible results. This shift could increase costs hurting TripAdvisor on the bottom line; however, most analysts are expecting TRIP to beat the Street's projection on revenue. Here's how investors expect TRIP to report Tuesday.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors. (Click Here to see All Estimates for TripAdvisor)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for TRIP to report 20c EPS and $204.96M revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 22c EPS and $207.25M revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting TRIP to beat the Wall Street consensus on both EPS and revenue.Throughout the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting TRIP's profit and revenue 4 and 3 times respectively. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors, Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing an average differential compared to previous quarters.This quarter analysts are expecting year-over-year profit to decline but for revenue to be up compared to FQ4 last year. The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from 18c to 28c EPS and $195.00M to $217.90M in revenues. This quarter, we're seeing a moderate distribution of estimates on TRIP compared to recent quarters.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market, which could mean greater volatility post earnings.Throughout the quarter, the EPS estimate from Wall Street decreased from 25c to 20c while the Estimize consensus started and ended the period at 23c. Over the same time period, Wall Street lowered its revenue expectation from $211.8M to $204.96M while the Estimize forecast pushed higher from $205.63M to $207.25M. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and increasing analyst revisions going into a report are often a bullish indicator.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is brianprovost who projects 22c EPS and $206.00M in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season, brianprovost rated as the 287th best analyst and is ranked 1084th overall among over 3,800 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case, brianprovost is expecting TripAdvisor beat the Estimize.com consensus on both profit and revenue but is expecting TRIP to report less revenue than the Estimize consensus is calling for.This quarter, contributing analysts on the Estimize.com platform have high expectations for TRIP. Despite the shift within the past year to a hotel metasearch model, analysts are still projecting TripAdvisor to beat Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom line.Disclosure: No positions."
2083153,23479,2014-03-12T07:05:48-04:00,,"TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), the world's largest travel review company, has historically seen robust revenue growth at its subscription, transaction and other (STO) division. The company earned $29 million as STO revenues in 2010, and the figure grew at a compounded annual rate of about 65% to $130 million in 2013. This compares with contemporaneous growth of 25% in the company's top-line. Improved sales productivity and pricing for the company's Business Listings product, and increased brand awareness, inventory and transactions for the company's Vacation Rentals product, were the key drivers behind the out-performance of the division. [1]STO contributes slightly less than 15% to total company revenues and accounts for 14% of our $83 valuation for TripAdvisor's stock. We expect the division to continue growing strongly on the back of sales efficiency, a rapidly expanding user base, the launch of TripConnect for small and independent hotels, and the introduction of a new commission model for vacation rentals. In this article, we discuss the different revenue sources for TripAdvisor STO and the drivers for its future growth.Different Sources Of Revenue For STO BusinessThe revenue generated by TripAdvisor from Business Listings and Vacation Rentals is recognized as subscription revenue. The Business Listings service allows hotels, B&Bs and other specialty lodging properties to register themselves on TripAdvisor branded websites, as well as to post special offers for travelers. The Vacation Rentals service, in turn, allows the listing of vacation properties on TripAdvisor's vacation rental sites such as FlipKey, Holiday Lettings and Niumba. Transaction revenues consist of revenues from bookings of hotel rooms on TripAdvisor's transactional sites, Jetsetter and Tingo. And other revenue comprises of content licensing revenues from third-party sites. [2]Key Factors That Will Fuel Future Growth In STO1. The Rapidly Growing User Base To Help In Closing The Gap Between Listed Businesses And Reviewed Hotels: Although the number of Business Listings subscribers has grown by more than 50% annually since 2010 to reach 69,000 in 2013, it is still only about 9% of the total hotel listings for reviews (775,000 hotels and accommodations) on TripAdvisor's sites. [2] This presents a huge opportunity for the company to grow its Business Listings subscriber base.We expect the number of business listings to continue growing at high double-digit rates, at least in the near term, since TripAdvisor is increasingly gaining preference among travelers as a travel review website. The total number of monthly unique visitors to TripAdvisor's sites grew by over 50% in 2013 to 260 million, and we estimate that the figure will surpass 750 million by the end of our review period. Hotels are likely to gain more visibility among these users if they subscribe to Business Listings.2. Launch Of Tripconnect To Help Add More Listings: Last year in October, TripAdvisor launched the TripConnect platform that allows small and independent hotels to participate in meta-display. The option to participate in meta was previously available only to large hotel chains, and online travel agencies such as Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE). TripConnect offers property owners the chance to bypass OTAs and generate bookings through their own website.A total of 210 Internet Booking Engines (IBE) covering 135,000 properties worldwide had signed up for TripConnect before its launch, better than the company's expectations. [3] We expect more sign ups in the future since TripConnect helps property owners to save time on marketing efforts, to reduce commissions paid to OTAs, and to better understand guests' perception about their property through post-stay reviews. A hotel needs to be a Business Listings subscriber with TripAdvisor in order to participate in TripConnect and therefore, we also expect the number of Business Listings subscribers to increase going forward. The growth will likely accelerate from 2015 since TripAdvisor has prioritized TripConnect for that year. To learn more about the benefits of TripConnect, read our article: TripConnect to Give Small & Independent Hotels A Chance To Compete With Larger Players.3. New Free-to-list Commission Model Will Attract More Vacation Rental Properties: Under the subscription-based model, vacation rental properties pay a flat listing fee to TripAdvisor for a particular time period. The new free-to-list transaction-based model for vacation renting, introduced by the company in the first quarter of 2013, allows for free listing of vacation properties. Instead, property owners pay TripAdvisor when a customer makes a booking for the property. This has enhanced the property owner's experience by reducing the friction to list properties. The free-to-list model also allows TripAdvisor to list those properties at the top which have higher conversion rates, thus providing the best recommendation to the traveler.TripAdvisor catered to 300,000 vacation rental properties until 2012. The new model helped the company to add another 250,000 properties last year. [2] We expect a greater number of property owners and managers to be enticed by the new offering, allowing the company to build a formidable inventory base in the fast growing, highly fragmented online vacation rentals market in the U.S. According to a study by PhoCusWright, the U.S. market for vacation renting stood at $23 billion in 2012. Online sales accounted for about 24% of the bookings in that year, and the percentage is expected to increase to 30% in this year. [4]Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
2001251,23479,2014-02-06T16:03:40-05:00,,"TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), the world's largest travel review company, saw its stock price almost double in 2013 from $44 at the beginning of the year to $83 at the end of it. There were several factors that led to this sharp up-move, including the company's growing user base and increasing revenues per page view. During the year, TripAdvisor entered new markets, completed the roll-out of its new meta-display platform and improved its mobile products. These initiatives allowed the company to better serve users and advertising partners.We have a price estimate of $80 for TripAdvisor's stock, implying a premium of about 5% to its market price. In this article, we analyze the major developments in 2013 that fueled the rise in the stock price, and how these developments will drive future growth.Traffic Maintained Its Strong Growth MomentumTripAdvisor had 200 million monthly unique visitors in Q1 2013, which increased to 260 million in Q3 driven by the company's efforts to tap opportunities in mobile and international markets. [1] In March, TripAdvisor entered into a partnership with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), making it the only travel application to come pre-installed onto the new Samsung Galaxy S4. [2] It also expanded in Latin America in the third quarter, adding new TripAdvisor domains in localized Spanish language in Venezuela, Peru, Chile and Colombia. [1] Its new meta-search platform that enhances overall user experience also helped bring more traffic to its websites. We will elaborate on the meta feature in the next section.We believe that TripAdvisor's user base will continue to grow strongly with increasing investment into the mobile platform, expansion in international markets, and rapid adoption of the meta-search platform.New Meta-Display Platform Received Good Response From Top Advertising PartnersHistorically, users had to click on advertisers' links on TripAdvisor's website to check information on hotel pricing and availability. The company rolled out its new meta-display feature in Q2 that collates and displays hotel pricing and availability data from top advertisers on a single page. In other words, the new feature allows users to do comparison-based shopping on TripAdvisor's website itself. Although this has lowered the number of leads sent to advertisers, the leads are more qualified and have better conversion rates. That's because travelers are now more likely to visit advertisers' websites for booking rather than just seeking information.TripAdvisor almost tripled its advertising rates for better leads and conversion rates. The company witnessed reduced bidding activity on the new platform in the second quarter as advertisers were wary of the high prices and the transition to meta. However, realizing that TripAdvisor is an important traffic generating channel for online travel agencies (OTAs), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), the biggest online travel agency in the U.S., ramped up bidding activity on the platform in Q3. [3] The move was followed by other advertisers. We believe that TripAdvisor will be able to further increase its advertising rates since users are likely to spend more time on its enhanced website.TripConnect Was Launched In Order To Cater To A Larger MarketIn October, TripAdvisor launched the TripConnect platform that allows small and independent hotels to participate in meta-display. The option to participate in meta was previously available only to large hotel chains, and online travel agencies such as Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia. We think that TripConnect is a win-win for all three - independent property owners, TripAdvisor and users. It offers property owners the chance to bypass OTAs and generate bookings through their own website, thereby saving time on marketing efforts, reducing commissions paid to OTAs, and helping them better understand guests' perception about their property through post-stay reviews. TripAdvisor benefits from fresher, verified reviews and higher advertising revenues, while its users have more booking options and review content to explore.A total of 210 Internet booking engines covering 135,000 properties worldwide signed up for TripConnect ahead of its launch, better than the company's expectations. Close to 90% of these committed 210 Internet booking engines opted for the premium offering. We think that it may not be possible for many small and independent hotels to outbid big hotel chains and OTAs due to the large scale and access to resources of the latter. Nevertheless, TripAdvisor's vast reach is attractive to hoteliers, which should get more property owners to try out this new auction platform.Direct Bookings Introduced On Smartphone AppsUsing TripAdvisor's app was cumbersome for users until October as they had to click on advertisers' links to see details and complete the booking process. In October, the company launched native apps for Android and iOS devices to reduce this friction. The re-launched apps allowed in-app navigation by keeping the booking experience restricted within TripAdvisor's app instead of launching new advertiser windows in a mobile browser. [4]Although this has enhanced the interface, users continue to struggle when they want to move back and forth between advertisers' and TripAdvisor's content. The problem is more prominent in smartphones than other devices due to the smaller size of the screen. Therefore, during the Q3 earnings call the company announced that it would begin taking direct bookings on its smartphone apps from 2014. [1] This will further enhance usability by allowing users to complete the booking without leaving TripAdvisor. We think that these initiatives will help the company to improve smartphone monetization levels. Its smartphone monetization is presently less than 20% of that on desktops.TripAdvisor is slated to release its earnings for fiscal 2013 on February 11, and we will be closely watching these developments.Disclosure: No positions."
1977591,24513,2014-01-29T15:20:27-05:00,,"Profitability is one of the main factors one must look at when analyzing a company. It is not only the reason why a company exists, but also a key element when determining whether to invest in a company or not. Thus, in this article I will look into TripAdvisor's (NASDAQ:TRIP) earnings and earnings growth, profit margins, profitability ratios and cash flow. Additionally, I will evaluate which institutional investors bought the stock in the recent quarters (institutional backup can tell a lot about a stock).The first step when analyzing TripAdvisor Inc is evaluating its recent earnings per share performance. Certainly, how a company has performed in the past is helpful information, since it provides strong clues about how it will handle the future. Barring some unforeseen circumstance, most companies move in a predictable manner. The company generated -2% EPS growth last quarter compared to the same quarter in the past year. I am looking for quarterly growth rates above 15%. I am not encouraged to see that TRIP generated less than that number. Past growth winners (Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), etc) generated consistent quarterly EPS growth above 15% and I am certainly looking for that level before investing. It is important to highlight that analysts just upgraded its estimates for the current year, increasing projected EPS to9%.I also look at the 3-year annual average EPS growth rate to get a perspective on how the company grew in recent years. TRIP generated 19% annualized average EPS growth in the past 3 years. The company generated strong growth in the past 3 years, in fact higher than the 15% threshold growth level I use for these kinds of companies.In addition to analyzing EPS growth, I focus on evaluating TRIP's top line or revenue growth. The value of common stocks is, of course, closely tied to the sales power of the company. Therefore, an understanding of the company's growth potential for both the near and long-term timeframes is required before in a sound investment decision.TRIP generated 20% quarterly revenue growth compared to the same period last year.TRIP generated strong revenue growth. This was fueled by improved product adoptions and continued success in management´s strategy to expand into emerging markets. I require a minimum of 15% quarterly sales growth when investing in high growing companies and TripAdvisor Inc generated more than that level. When quarterly revenues grow at a faster rate than EPS, I usually interpret it as a good sign. This is exactly the case at TripAdvisor Inc, which generated revenue growth levels above its own EPS growth levels. In general, the opposite happens. Managements mask earnings growth and show very different revenues and earnings growth levels (revenues are more difficult to trick using accounting tactics).I also tend to look at how TripAdvisor Inc increased its earnings over the past 3 years. TRIP generated an average 3 year annual sales growth of 24%. This is a very important metric that Investors Business Daily (NYSEARCA:IBD) - the best source for growth stocks ideas - pays attention to when analyzing high growth companies, and so should you. I require a minimum 3 year annual sales growth above 15% and TripAdvisor Inc meets that criteria.Gross Profit MarginThe gross profit margin is a measure of a company's manufacturing and distribution efficiency during the production process. The gross profit tells an investor the percentage of revenue/sales left after subtracting the cost of the goods/services sold. A company that operates on a higher profit margin than its competitors is more efficient. Investors tend to pay more for businesses that have higher efficiency ratings as these should be able to make a decent profit as long as overhead costs are controlled (overhead refers to rent, utilities, etc.). In the case of TripAdvisor Inc, its gross margins over the past years have increased. The 5-year low for the gross margin was reported at 98.3%. On the opposite, the 5-year high for the margin was reported in 2012, when the company retrieved a 99.2% margin. In fact, the 2012 gross profit margin of 98.4% is above the 5-year average of 98.2%. A gross margin above the 5-year average implies that management has been successful in making manufacturing and distribution during the production process more efficient over the past 5 years. I like to find companies that operate with high profit margins.Operating Margin = Operating Income / Total Sales The operating margin is a measure of the proportion of a company's revenue that is left over after paying for variable costs of production, such as wages, raw materials, etc. A healthy operating margin is required for a company to be able to pay for its fixed costs such as interest on debt. If a company's margin is increasing, it is earning more per dollar of sales. Needless to say: the higher the margin, the better.Over the past 5 years, TripAdvisor's operating margin has been increasing. In 2008, the company reported an operating margin of 41.9%. In 2012 the company had an operating margin of 38.8%.The 2012 operating margin of 38.8% is above the 5-year average of 34.7%. This implies that there has been an increase in the percentage of the total sales left over after paying for variable costs of production such as wages and raw materials compared to the 5-year average. I am always looking for companies that have improving operating margin trends.Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Total SalesA ratio of profitability is calculated as net income divided by revenue, or net profits divided by sales. It measures how much out of every dollar of sales a company actually keeps in earnings.The profit margin is a very useful metric when comparing companies in the same - or similar - industries. A higher profit margin indicates a more profitable company that has better control over its costs compared to its competitors. Profit margin is displayed as a percentage. A 20% profit margin, for example, means the company has a net income of $0.20 for each dollar of sales.Over the past 5 years, TripAdvisor Inc's net profit margin has been increasing in comparison to the five-year average margin. The net profit margin of 25.44% in 2012 is above the 5-year average of 24.27%. This implies that there has been an increase in the percentage of earnings that the company is able to keep compared to the company's 5-year average.The listed profitability margins are revealing that the company is gaining strength. I require strong net profit margins when investing in a stock for the long term.ROA - Return on Assets = Net Income / Total Assets ROA is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. ROA gives an idea as to how efficient management is at using its assets to generate earnings. Calculated by dividing a company's net income by its total assets, ROA is displayed as a percentage. Sometimes this is referred to as ""return on investment."" The 2012 ROA of 18.18% is slightly above the 5-year average of 16.16%. As the 201S ROA of 18.18% is above the 5-year average of 16.16%, This implies that management has ameliorated its ability to use the company's assets to generate earnings over the past five years.Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditure A measure of financial performance calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow (NYSE:FCF) represents the cash that a company is able to generate after laying out the money required to maintain or expand its asset base. Free cash flow is important because it allows a company to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. Without cash, it's tough to develop new products, make acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce debt.TripAdvisor Inc generated a ratio of cash flow from operations/total sales of 27.50. The higher the percentage, the more cash available from sales. If a company is generating a negative cash flow, it shows up as a negative number in the numerator in the cash flow margin equation. This means that even as the company is generating sales revenue, it is losing money.Institutional InvestorsSeveral institutional investors have been buying TRIP in recent quarters. This is important because hedge funds use strict fundamental procedures before investing in a stock. I feel encouraged that Julian Robertson and Steve Mandel bought the stock in the past months at an average price of $38.97. This shows that hedge funds have confidence in the stock.Analyst OutlookCurrently, many analysts have a good outlook for TripAdvisor Inc. Analysts at MSN money are predicting TripAdvisor Inc to retrieve EPS of $1.68 for FY 2013 and, $2.20 for FY 2014. Analysts at Bloomberg are estimating TripAdvisor Inc's revenue reach $937.10M million for FY 2013 and $1.15B million for FY 2014. On 23/09/2013, Stifel gave TripAdvisor Inc a rating of ""Buy"" with a target price of $105.00. A $105.00 price target signifies significant upside potential from this point.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2020051,23479,2014-02-13T15:35:09-05:00,,"The world’s largest online travel review company, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), posted revenues of $212.7 million in the final quarter of fiscal year 2013. Click-based advertising revenue increased by 17% year on year and accounted for 68% of total revenues. The business benefited as TripAdvisor’s meta-display platform approached revenue neutrality in December, owing to an increase in pricing and conversion rates. We will talk about meta in detail in this article. [1] [2]TripAdvisor’s display-based advertising revenues jumped by 46% in Q4 to $32.5 million, due to certain seasonal purchases from advertisers. Its subscription, transaction and other revenues also grew sharply to $35.7 million, registering a 53% rise over the year-ago period. This was driven by pricing and productivity improvements in business listings, and by increased brand awareness, inventory and transactions in vacation rentals. [1] [2]In Q3, TripAdvisor tested and rolled out its ad campaign in the U.S. However, the bulk of its TV marketing spend shifted to Q4, as the company began targeting international markets near the end of the third quarter. Consequently, the adjusted EBITDA margin fell to approximately 25% in the fourth quarter from 41% in the third quarter and 38% in the year-ago period. The impact also trickled down to the bottom line. The company’s net income shrunk to $20 million, posting a sequential decline of about 65%. [1] TripAdvisor’s management conveyed that it is not really focused on margin expansion and that it will continue to make investments in those prospects that have the potential to drive long term growth. [2]We are in the process of updating our $80 price estimate for TripAdvisor based on the recently announced results.Meta-Display Approaches Revenue NeutralityEarlier, users had to click through to an advertiser’s website in order to view hotel pricing and availability information. TripAdvisor launched a new meta feature in Q4 2012, that collates and displays this information from top advertisers on its own website. Although this has lowered the number of leads sent by TripAdvisor to its advertisers, the leads are more qualified and have better conversion rates, as travelers are now more likely to click on the advertiser’s link for booking rather than just seeking information.The better quality leads allowed TripAdvisor to increase its advertising rates. Despite this, the meta platform was unable to achieve revenue neutrality until Q3 as fewer leads were being sent to advertisers than before. Advertisers were wary of the transition to meta-display, and therefore, were conservative when bidding on the new platform. During the Q4 earnings call, TripAdvisor’s management said that the meta feature approached revenue neutrality in December last year. This was achieved through a combination of higher ad pricing and better conversion rates. Pricing improved through the quarter as competition among advertisers to gain visibility in the meta platform lifted bids, while conversion rates improved as more users returned to make purchases. [2]TripAdvisor’s vast user base is its key growth driver as it attracts many advertisers. Monthly unique visitors to the company’s websites grew by 50% year-on-year in Q4 to 260 million. [1] We believe that meta will help TripAdvisor to further expand its user base as it enhances overall user experience. We also believe that it will provide a boost to the ad revenue earned by the company per page view as users start making more purchases and competition on meta heats up further.Mobile Monetization To Improve Through 2014TripAdvisor’s mobile traffic as a percentage of total traffic nearly doubled last year to 40%. The number of downloads for its app also grew by about 150% to 82 million. [1] Although mobile is becoming an increasingly important source of traffic for the company, its monetization on smartphones is only 20% of that on desktops. The main reason for this is the smaller screen size that makes it difficult to feed in data, and hand-off issues that occur while navigating to a travel supplier’s (advertiser) website.The hand-off issue is a more pronounced problem for TripAdvisor as the meta functionality creates friction when users want to move back and forth between advertisers’ and TripAdvisor’s content. The company announced in October that it will begin taking direct bookings on mobile in 2014 to reduce this friction. The platform is called Assisted Book since it will allow users to book with TripAdvisor in addition to other OTA options. Completing the booking with TripAdvisor itself will also increase the likelihood of the transaction being successful. According to the management, building the Assisted Book platform will be the key focus for TripAdvisor in 2014 just as meta-display was in 2013. [2]The percentage of travelers using a mobile device to search for travel related information has gone up from 8% in 2009 to 38% in 2012 for leisure travelers and from 25% to 57% for business travelers. [3] Therefore, we believe it is important for TripAdvisor to efficiently monetize on the mobile platform. The company’s drive to remove the friction associated with mobile bookings should help it do so. To learn more about the initiatives TripAdvisor took in 2013 to enhance the mobile experience for users, read our article: TripAdvisor’s Drive To Remove The Friction Associated With Mobile Bookings Will Lift Smartphone Monetization LevelsOutlook for 2014Click-based ad revenue: Growth in low 20s (excluding the effect of TV ad campaign and Assisted Book)Display-based ad revenue: mid to high teensSubscription, transaction and other revenue: low 50sNotes:Disclosure: No positions"
1762012,23479,2013-10-22T18:23:02-04:00,,"TripAdvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) is set to release its third quarter earnings for fiscal year 2013 on Wednesday, October 23. The company continued its growth momentum in Q2 2013 with a 25% y-o-y increase in revenue, driven primarily by traffic growth. Click-based advertising revenue grew 21% y-o-y on account of robust growth in hotel shoppers in both core and emerging markets. Display-based advertising revenue growth accelerated to 18% owing to a rise in traffic and better sell-through rates.Despite the management's expectation of a temporary slowdown due to the roll out of the new meta-display, we believe TripAdvisor's user base and revenues will grow. This is achievable through higher sales productivity, expanding mobile and international presence, and the enhanced user experience that the meta feature offers.Our price estimate of $80 for TripAdvisor marks our valuation at a premium of about 5% to the current market price.Meta-Display Headwinds To Be More Intense This QuarterEarlier, TripAdvisor's partner pages appeared in a pop-up window when a user entered a travel query. The company has now integrated all the search query results on the main page known as meta-search. This enhancement allows users to see travel content, real time hotel pricing and availability from booking partners, all on a single page.The transition to meta-search negatively impacted revenues by approximately 3%-5% in Q1 2013. The impact was even more magnified in Q2 2013 at 6%-9% as the meta feature roll-out approached completion during the quarter. Management expects continued headwinds on Q3 2013 earnings as it is the first quarter with 100% meta throughout the period. The effects will also trickle down to the bottom-line as hiring and investment plans remained unchanged. On the positive front, the management expects the impact to steadily subside thereafter and the meta-platform to achieve revenue neutrality by year end as it brings more customers on board, conversion rates improve and advertisers become more familiar with the meta-search operating model.Traffic Growth To Maintain Its MomentumThe number of monthly unique visitors to TripAdvisor's websites is one of the primary drivers fueling the company's present growth. TripAdvisor's user base has nearly tripled compared to last year due to its dominating presence in the global travel review industry. TripAdvisor websites averaged over 220 million monthly unique visitors in Q2 2013. The company's mobile traffic grew over 200% y-o-y and accounted for about 35% of the total traffic. Cumulative downloads for TripAdvisor apps breached the 50 million mark, registering an annual increase of more than 125%.The meta-display feature has enhanced the overall user experience by addressing queries on a single page. The new transaction-based subscription model has increased the visibility of businesses and helps the company provide the best recommendation to users. Also, the company has a vast international presence with TripAdvisor branded websites in 30 countries and 21 languages. It is presently working on new TripAdvisor domains in localized languages to better serve local travelers and align its offerings with its local OTA partners in the region. We believe TripAdvisor's user base will continue to grow strongly driven by such factors.Subscription And Related Revenue To Continue Its Growth TrajectoryThe new transaction-based model introduced in Q1 2013 is different from the old subscription model under which properties paid a subscription fee to TripAdvisor for business listing. Now, properties are free to list but they pay on a per transaction basis, which has resulted in a greater number of businesses listing themselves. This also allows TripAdvisor to list those properties at the top which have higher conversion rates, thus providing the best recommendation to the user.TripAdvisor's subscription, transaction and other revenue increased by 68% y-o-y in Q2 2013. The company expects to see continued sales productivity in business listings and higher vacation renting due to the introduction of the offering.Based on the company's performance in the upcoming Q3 2013 results, we will update our price estimate of $80 for TripAdvisor.Disclosure: No positions"
1575932,23479,2013-07-26T11:57:07-04:00,,"The world’s largest travel review website, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), continued to grow strongly in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 with a 25% y-o-y increase in revenue, driven primarily by traffic growth. Click-based advertising revenue grew 21% y-o-y due to robust growth in hotel shoppers in both core and emerging markets while display-based advertising revenue growth accelerated to 18% owing to a rise in traffic and better sell-through rates.The company’s EBITDA slowed with 16% y-o-y growth compared to 30% observed last quarter on account of hiring and acquisition related costs as well as headwinds related to the meta display roll-out. Management expects further EBITDA growth to slow in the second half of the year due to the negative impact from the transition to meta and costs related to the launch of its new off-line ad campaign [TripAdvisor Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Seeking Alpha, July 24, 2013].Despite management’s expectation of temporary ramifications resulting from the full-fledged roll-out of the meta display, we believe TripAdvisor’s user base and revenues will grow in the long term with growth in its mobile platform, the expansion of its international footprint, and higher acceptance of its meta feature by users and advertisers.Meta Display To Limit Short Term Growth But Approach Revenue Neutrality By Year EndTripAdvisor rolled out its new meta display feature globally across its smartphone traffic in Q4 2012. By Q1 2013, about 20% of the company’s desktop and tablet users were using the meta display feature. The transition to 100% meta display across all devices globally was completed in the latter part of Q2 2013.Earlier, TripAdvisor’s partner pages appeared in a pop-up window when a user entered a travel query. However, the company has now integrated all the search query results on the main page known as meta-search. When users perform a search on TripAdvisor, they get all results on the page along with a map that pinpoints the location in the user’s search results. This enhancement allows users to see travel content, real time hotel pricing and availability from booking partners, all on a single page.Revenue from advertisements on meta search are CPC (cost per click) based. Since comparison-shopping now takes place on TripAdvisor’s website, fewer leads are sent to advertisers. However, the leads are more qualified, resulting in higher conversion rates of hotel shoppers to revenue-generating clicks [Tripadvisor Shakes Up Business With Aggressive Hotel Metasearch, Skift.com. Feb 13, 2013]. Hence, TripAdvisor charges CPC rates about three times higher than historical rates, although the higher rates have not yet been able to offset revenue headwinds due to fewer leads sent than before. This negatively impacted growth by approximately 3%–5% in Q1 2013. The impact was even more magnified in Q2 2013 at 6%–9% due to the 100% roll-out of the meta feature in the latter part of the quarter.Management expects continued headwinds in Q3 2013 as it will be the first quarter with 100% meta throughout the period, and the effects will also fall to the bottom-line as hiring and investment plans remain unchanged. However, it also expects the impact to steadily subside thereafter and see revenue neutrality by the end of the year as the meta feature brings more customers on board, conversion rates improve and advertisers become more familiar with the meta search operating model. Although the meta transition is expected to negatively impact TripAdvisor in the short term, we believe the feature will help the company expand its user base in the long run as it enhances the overall user experience by addressing queries on a single page. This in turn will lead to revenue enhancement as the company’s vast user base is its key growth driver.Strong Traffic Growth Owing To Mobile And International ExpansionThe average unique monthly visitors on TripAdvisor’s websites stood at 220 million in Q2 2013, an increase of about 57% y-o-y. Mobile traffic grew over 200% y-o-y and accounted for about 35% of the total traffic while cumulative app downloads for the quarter breached 50 million, an annual increase of more than 125%.TripAdvisor recently entered into a partnership with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) making it the only travel application to come pre-installed on the new Samsung Galaxy S4. This benefited the company as app utilization increased by 10% during Q2 2013. With the acquisition of GateGuru, TinyPost and Jetsetter, TripAdvisor added several new travel, search and review apps, and websites to its portfolio in Q2 2013.Hotel shopper growth showed good progress on smartphones with triple-digit growth rates. However, while monetization levels of tablets are already approaching that of desktops, smartphone monetization remains low at around 20%. We believe the current boom in mobile usage will fuel growth in the user base for TripAdvisor, and as the company strives to improve monetization rates on smartphones, revenue will grow.Also, the company has a vast international presence with TripAdvisor branded websites in 30 countries and 21 languages. About 50% of its revenues come from international markets. TripAdvisor is presently working on new TripAdvisor domains in localized languages to better serve local travelers and align its offerings with its local OTA partners in the region. As it targets growth outside the U.S., we feel that it can witness higher growth in hotel shoppers as the hotel industry in international markets offers better growth opportunities compared to the U.S. market, where growth is slower.New Transaction-Based Offering Lifts Outlook For Subscription And Other Related Revenue GrowthSubscription, transaction and other revenue increased by 68% y-o-y in Q2 2013 mainly due to improved business listing sales productivity and higher vacation rentals. Subscription and other revenues contributed 13% to the company’s total revenue compared to 10% in Q2 2012.

1512462,22675,2013-06-20T09:53:34-04:00,,"Tripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) was spun off from Expedia over a year ago and from the start I was very excited. I did get burned initially but I’m starting to consider it for my next long-term speculative pick. It would be a bit outside of my ecosystem philosophy but I’m starting to believe that TripAdvisor will end up becoming the top travel website out there, surpassing giant Priceline (PCLN) and others.  We can also compare revenue and growth. I think it’s fair to say that TRIP has a lot of momentum. Of course, that should not be a big surprise. As a much smaller and newer player, it should be growing a lot faster. If it wasn’t, there would be an issue.The One Big FactorMore critical to this analysis though is the fact that TripAdvisor is increasingly becoming the starting point for travelers planning a trip. Just look at traffic to its websites and you can see what I mean. As it continues to build around a strong community, the website is becoming more useful in ways that competitors simply cannot challenge. The plan seemed to be to build a great product/community at first that would provide the community with a comprehensive number of reviews no matter what you were looking into. Then it made it easier to see where our friends have been (as well as our extended friends) thanks to its Facebook connect link.Now comes the best step from a shareholder perspective, TripAdvisor is making it easier for users to book their trip by providing them prices and other means.Much More To ComeAs TripAdvisor continues to create relationships with these millions of hotels, restaurants and other local businesses by helping them interact with users, give relevant information and more, it will also open the door to more possibilities such as helping users book (eventually) and letting businesses advertise more easily, etc. The possibilities are significant and very difficult to compete with for competitors.Does TripAdvisor look cheap at its current valuation? Not exactly. But I do think the potential for growth is very significant and am strongly considering getting in on the action.I’d love to hear from you."
1848461,23479,2013-11-19T08:45:56-05:00,,"Mobile devices are emerging as a big growth opportunity for online travel companies including booking agencies, such as Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN), and review websites, such as TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). The percentage of travelers using a mobile device to search for travel related information has gone up from 8% in 2009 to 38% in 2012 for leisure travelers and from 25% to 57% for business travelers. [1] The boom in mobile device usage for travel means that travel companies must tap these sources to not only generate incremental revenues, but to also stay competitive in the industry.A significant portion of the aforementioned travelers (~40%) convert into bookers on mobile browsers, while only 10%-20% of travelers use mobile apps to make bookings. The main reasons for such low conversion rates on mobile apps include hand off issues while navigating to a travel supplier’s (advertiser) website, a small screen size that makes it difficult to feed in data, and low perceived security on mobile devices. [1]TripAdvisor has been struggling with similar problems. Its app does not offer a smooth and user friendly experience. However, the company is striving to make its apps better by keeping the user experience at the top of its priority list. We believe that this will help the company to improve conversion rates and monetization levels. In this article we talk about TripAdvisor’s evolution to address issues in its mobile apps and how we believe it will benefit the company.Our price estimate of $80 for TripAdvisor is at a discount of about 10% to the current market price.Why TripAdvisor Needs To Make The Most Out Of SmartphonesTripAdvisor recently began displaying display advertising on smartphones. Its smartphone monetization is presently less than 20% of that on desktops due to lack of further smartphone monetization strategies. With an average of 108 million monthly unique visitors on phones and tablets, mobile devices account for close to 40% of the total traffic on TripAdvisor. Cumulative downloads for TripAdvisor’s app stand at 69 million, helped the partnership with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) to offer pre-installed apps on the Samsung galaxy S4 mobile phone. An average of 7 million monthly unique users access TripAdvisor’s app from that smartphone. Also, hotel shoppers on smartphones continue to grow by more than 100% year-on-year. [2] For these reasons we believe that TripAdvisor must monetize its smartphone traffic well. Recent Mobile Issues And TripAdvisor’s Initiatives To Reduce FrictionEarlier, a user on TripAdvisor’s app had to click through to different advertiser websites in order to seek information on hotel pricing and availability. The new meta-search feature launched by the company in Q4 2012 collated this information and presented it on TripAdvisor’s app itself. Using the app was cumbersome despite this enhancement as users still had to click on advertisers’ links to see the rest of the details and complete the booking process.The company launched native apps for Android and iOS in early October this year to fix the issue. The re-launched apps allow in-app navigation by keeping the booking experience restricted within TripAdvisor’s app instead of launching new advertiser windows in a mobile browser. [3]Although this has enhanced the interface, users continue to struggle when they want to move back and forth between advertisers’ and TripAdvisor’s content. The problem is more prominent in smartphones than other devices due to the smaller size of the screen. Therefore, the company has finally decided to take up direct bookings on its smartphone apps beginning 2014. [4] This will simplify the booking process as users will have the option of booking with TripAdvisor in addition to other OTA options. Completing the booking with TripAdvisor itself will also increase the likelihood of the transaction being successful.TripAdvisor made it clear in its Q3 2013 earnings call that it only intends to facilitate bookings and it will not become an online travel agency (OTA). If the company chooses to adopt the same practice as its competitors such as Kayak and Hipmunk, it will partner with an OTA that will process the bookings and handle customer service. The option of booking with TripAdvisor will be accompanied with other OTA options. [5]Rapid Evolution Will Help The Company Earn More Dollars Per Page ViewTripAdvisor’s meta feature is currently facing headwinds related to conversion rates. The company had expected a significant rise in the percentage of leads sent to advertisers that convert into actual bookers. However, conversion rate improvement in Q3 2013 was below the management’s expectations.Management attributed this to leakages in the meta system, which results from users who check pricing and availability information on TripAdvisor but do not click on to advertiser websites to make bookings. These users instead visit the advertiser’s website directly to complete their bookings. Hence, the search could effectively convert into a transaction but TripAdvisor doesn’t get its due credit. This is preventing TripAdvisor from earning the expected ad revenues per page view from its advertisers. (Read: TripAdvisor’s Quarterly Results Denote A Bumpy Patch Ahead Of Strong Growth)The new native apps allow the company to keep the booking process within the app, thereby reducing the browsing related hassles for the user. The direct booking tool will further enhance usability by allowing the user to complete the booking without leaving TripAdvisor. We think that these initiatives will help the company to improve conversion rates, and thus smartphone monetization, in turn boosting advertising revenue earned per page view.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

The pictures of the place were fantastic. The restaurants looked superb and the golf course- inviting. Throw in beautiful beaches plus world class fishing and I could hardly wait!I looked up recent temperatures in the area and packed for 89 degree weather. A comb, a toothbrush, a bathing suit, some shorts, and flip-flops…what else does a guy need?The flight was great, the weather was beautiful, and the sea was calm. The shrimp and bacon tacos were as good as any that I had eaten. The room was spotless, and the view was spectacular. I was settled in, ready to write my weekly newsletter.Something was not quite right, however. It seemed like the room was awfully warm. I opened up all the windows to get some fresh air while I tinkered with the thermostat. I figured the room would turn into an iceberg any minute. After repeated attempts to turn on the A/C, nothing happened. Finally, I decided, it was time to call the front desk.The front desk told me that someone would be down right away to fix the A/C. Eventually the A/C repairman did come. He banged around with his tools for an hour and a half then declared the A/C was fixed and went on his way. But still, nothing.I called the front desk again. They told me they would be unable to switch my room but that they would send the repairman back. While I was waiting the second time, I logged onto Trip Advisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) and wrote a blistering review of a so-called five star resort! That was the best thing that I could have done.When I showed the manager my posted review, I was promptly moved to a vacant room down the hall where the A/C worked just fine, thank you.That review earned me two free nights and three free breakfast buffets.How important is TripAdvisor to the Travel and Leisure industry?How about the stock?

While the robust growth in hotel shoppers and better pricing across all geographies contributed to a 24% annual increase in click based revenues, the y-o-y display advertising revenue growth re-accelerated to 14% due to rising traffic, better sell-through rates and slightly higher prices. Additionally, backed by recent acquisitions, TripAdvisor’s subscription, transaction and other revenues grew by 51% y-o-y.International expansion, increasing investment in developing its mobile platform and the transition to meta-search display are some of the key factors that we believe will drive TripAdvisor’s growth in the future. However, aiming to rollout its meta display feature across its products and platforms by the end of this year TripAdvisor expects lower revenue growth for the next two quarters.Witnessing a 54% annual increase in the number of unique monthly users in Q1 2013, we believe that TripAdvisor is well positioned to continue expanding its business in the future. Despite the temporary slowdown, we think that the rising traffic, a strong member base and increasing content across its growing global footprint will help TripAdvisor regain its growth momentum in the future.Full Roll Out To Meta Display To Limit Short-Term Growth During Q4 2012, TripAdvisor rolled out the meta display feature to 100% of its smartphone traffic and started testing it on desktops and tablets in Q1 2013. In TripAdvisor’s earlier feature, its partner pages appeared behind the main browser window when a user entered a travel query. However, the company has started integrating all the search query results on the main page, known as meta-search. When users execute a query on TripAdvisor, they get the results on the page along with a map, which pinpoints locations in users search results. This enhancement allows users to see hotel pricing options and availability from booking partners on a single page.Additionally, TripAdvisor redesigned its page last year by adding filters that make the search function more appealing to users by segmenting results on the basis of price, property type – family, romantic, business – etc. This enhances user experience by enabling them to quickly browse through reviews that are more suitable for their interests.With over 50% of its global traffic using the meta feature, TripAdvisor claims to be witnessing higher conversion rates after the introduction of meta display. Approximately 20% of the company’s desktop and tablet users are using the meta display feature currently, and it intends to roll out the same to all its global users by June this year.On the flip side, TripAdvisor’s meta roll-out negatively impacted its Q1 2013 revenue growth by 3%-5%, as it worked towards improving the conversion pricing and getting more customers on board the scheme. The company expects the negative impact to accelerate this quarter, but recover in the latter part of 2013, as it approaches revenue neutrality. The 100% conversion to the meta display platform will lead to pricing gains and higher conversion rates, which in turn will counter the revenue loss towards the end of the year.Though it limits the short-term growth, we believe that the transition is a good move for TripAdvisor’s long term growth, as it enhances the overall user experience.Improving Mobile Platform To Expand User BaseTripAdvisor believes that the mobile platform is one of the fastest growing product in terms of users, hotel shoppers and revenues. Leveraging growth in the rapidly expanding mobile user base remains a key priority for its long term growth strategy.At the end of Q1 2013, TripAdvisor reached close to 36 million downloads for the TripAdvisor application [TripAdvisor Management Discusses Q2 2013 Results – Earnings Call Transcript, Seeking Alpha, May 7, 2013]. The company has reached around 62 million monthly unique mobile device visitors, a y-o-y increase of 300%. It launched a significant update of its mobile application last month, and is working on a similar product refresh for the tablet applications. Additionally, TripAdvisor recently entered into a partnership with Samsung (PINK:SSNLF), making it the only travel application to come pre-installed onto the new Samsung Galaxy S4, which is expected to sell 10 million units per month. (TripAdvisor Management Discusses Q2 2013 Results – Earnings Call Transcript, Seeking Alpha, May 7, 2013)While the monetization levels of tablets are already approaching that of desktops, smartphone monetization remains low at around 20%. However, TripAdvisor expects the rate to improve in the future as it pays more attention in optimizing the meta experience and the meta pricing on the phone.Expanding International Footprint To Accelerate GrowthOver 60% of TripAdvisor’s traffic originates from outside its core markets of the U.S. and the U.K. With more than 75% increase in traffic, Asia-Pacific was one of the fastest growing markets for the company in 2012.TripAdvisor offers its content in 21 different languages with more than 60 contributions per minute, which equates to over 30 million contributions in a single year. In 2013, it intends to focus on enhancing its brand image in the emerging markets by incorporating more local language content to drive higher user engagement. As TripAdvisor targets growth outside the U.S., we feel that it can witness higher growth in hotel shoppers as the hotel industry in international markets offer better growth opportunities, compared to the U.S. market which is nearing saturation.TripAdvisor claims that around 50% of the traffic visiting its websites search for hotel deals [TripAdvisor’s Management Presents at Deutsche  Bank’s DbAccess 21st Annual Media and Telecom Conference (Transcript), Seeking Alpha, March 5, 2013].

1295481,23479,2013-03-22T13:57:37-04:00,,"TripAdvisor  (NASDAQ:TRIP) is a leading online platform for travel-related reviews  that helps its users make more informed travel decisions. With more than  74 million unique monthly visitors, the company covers 2 million  tourism businesses in over 116,000 destinations around the world. Last  week, TripAdvisor became the first company to cross the 100 million  reviews and opinions mark, a greater than 50% y-o-y increase.  TripAdvisor’s business model is primarily driven by the number of unique  visitors to its website, which in turn depends on the quality and  quantity of reviews offered on its websites.TripAdvisor has constantly remained under scrutiny for the  authenticity of its reviews, and the majority of the users trust the  reviews on its websites, which is backed by the fact that its user base  has more than doubled in the last four years. According to a recent  study by PhoCusWright, nearly 87% of TripAdvisor’s users agree that its  hotel reviews make them feel more confident in making a travel decision  and 80% feel that TripAdvisor reviews helped them have a better trip. Despite being the world’s largest travel review website, TripAdvisor  only has a 10% market penetration which leaves tremendous scope for  growth. In our previous article, we listed certain factors that justify our  rationale for TripAdvisor’s user base crossing 130 million over our  review period. (Read: Here’s Why We Believe TripAdvisor’s User Base Will Continue To Climb)  In this article, we discuss certain additional steps taken by the  company to solicit higher reviews on its websites and accelerate growth  in its user base in the future.  Enhancing User Experience With Meta Display During Q4 2012, TripAdvisor rolled out the meta display feature  across its smartphones offering, and started testing the same on  desktops and tablets. In TripAdvisor’s earlier feature, its partner  pages appeared behind the main browser window when a user entered a  travel query. However, the company has started integrating all the  search query results on the main page, known as meta-search. When users  execute a query on TripAdvisor, they get the results on the page along  with a map, which pinpoints locations in users search results. This  enhancement allows users to see hotel pricing options and availability  from booking partners on a single page.Additionally, the company redesigned its page last year by adding  filters that make the search function more appealing to users by  segmenting results on the basis of price, property type - family,  romantic, business - etc. This enhances user experience by enabling them  to quickly browse through reviews that are more suitable for their  interests.Currently, only 15% of TripAdvisor’s total traffic is using the  meta-display and it claims to be witnessing higher conversion rates  using this feature. TripAdvisor plans to roll out the meta display feature to all geographies and devices within the next 3-6 months.Expanding International Presence And Increasing Hotel ShoppersTripAdvisor claims that around 50% of the traffic visiting its websites search for hotel deals. An increase in the number of hotel searches on TripAdvisor’s websites  and mobile platforms contributed to 20% revenue growth, 18% click-based  revenue growth, and 9% adjusted EBITDA growth in 2012. TripAdvisor  claims to be witnessing continuous growth in hotel shoppers and better  y-o-y pricing. We estimate the trend to continue in 2013 as well.In addition to robust increase in travel demand from emerging markets  (Asia and South America), higher demand from more mature markets (the  U.S. and Western Europe) is driving hotel shopper growth on TripAdvisor,  though emerging markets are growing at a faster pace. Over 60% of  TripAdvisor’s traffic originates from outside its core markets of the  U.S. and the U.K., and Asia-Pacific was one of the fastest growing  markets for the company in 2012, with more than 75% increase in traffic.In 2013, TripAdvisor intends to focus on enhancing its brand image in  the emerging markets by incorporating more local language content to  drive higher user engagement. As TripAdvisor targets growth outside the  U.S., we feel that it can witness higher growth in hotel shoppers, as  the hotel industry in international markets offer better  growth opportunities compared to the U.S. market, which is  nearing saturation.Global Offline Advertising Campaign Will Expand Target AudienceIn addition to TripAdvisor’s permanent branding campaign, which  includes the awards, certificates, stickers and badges in hotels,  restaurants and travel websites across the globe, the company is working  towards an aggressive global offline campaign. TripAdvisor feels that  a meaningful offline marketing campaign can help further develop its  global brand value.TripAdvisor believes that by helping expand its target audience, the  global offline campaign can accelerate its growth rate in the future.  It intends to roll out campaign by the start of Q3 2013. TripAdvisor  expects its sales and marketing expenditure as a percentage of revenue  to increase from mid-30s to low to mid-40s in 2013.Our price estimate of $38.34 for TripAdvisor, is at a discount of over 10% to the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."

The meta-display feature will roll out to 100% of TripAdvisor’s users by the time the campaign hits the market.Priceline recently completed its acquisition of Kayak, a leading meta-search company, which accounts for over 50% share of the U.S. meta-search market. Last year, Priceline (PCLN) launched its first offline advertising campaign to build the Booking.com brand in the U.S. to narrow its market share gap with Expedia. The two companies combined spend around $65 million annually on TV advertising. (TripAdvisor prepares to launch its first TV ad campaign in the US, Tnooz, May 31, 2013)Despite growing at a comparatively slower pace compared to other economies, the U.S. travel market is the biggest in terms of online travel sales with estimated revenues of $151 billion in 2012. [2] While the aggressive ad campaign might restrict its short-term market growth, we think that it will help TripAdvisor compete better with other established players in the region. Our price estimate of $53.73 for TripAdvisor is at a discount of over 10% to the current market price.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

The company is set to announce its Q1 2013 earnings Tuesday, May 7, and we expect it to mark a strong start to its fiscal 2013.While there are certain factors that can limit growth this year such as a mix shift towards international markets, increasing hotel shoppers on mobile devices and lower click-based pricing, we believe that TripAdvisor is well-positioned to continue expanding its business in the future. Rising traffic, a strong member base and increasing content across its growing global footprint will help TripAdvisor continue its growth momentum in the future as well.

Increasing Investment In Social & Mobile Platforms To Enhance Brand Awareness: Leveraging growth in social platforms and the rapidly expanding mobile user base remain key priorities for TripAdvisor’s long term growth strategy.In 2012, TripAdvisor managed to more than double the members acquired through Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). At 44 million, its marketable members increased by almost 100% y-o-y. With over 32 million logged-in Facebook users, TripAdvisor’s Facebook app reached the number one spot in terms of monthly active users in Q4 2012, and was the only travel app in the top 20 applications. Presently, 35% of TripAdvisor’s new reviews are derived from its Facebook connected members.As of Q4 2012, TripAdvisor had around 45 million monthly unique mobile device visitors, a y-o-y increase of 190%.

With more than 74 million unique monthly visitors, the company covers 2 million tourism businesses in over 116,000 destinations across the globe.Smartphone adoption around the world is skyrocketing and is fundamentally changing the way people get travel advice. To stay in tune with the changing consumer trend, TripAdvisor has been focusing on increasing its avenues to make its mobile platform more accessible to users. We expect the company's expanding mobile platform to contribute significantly toward rising traffic flow on its websites.  Mobile Platform Offer Long-Term Growth Opportunities With the rapid adoption of smartphones and tablets, mobile devices are increasingly becoming a preferred and more convenient option for online searches and shopping. According to IDC, mobile travel spend is expected to cross the $2 billion mark by 2014, registering y-o-y growth of above 40%. Additionally, mobile ad spending in the U.S. is expected to grow from $1.5 billion in 2011 to close to $10.8 billion by 2016.As per a study last year commissioned by Expedia and conducted by comScore, around 48% of the users use a tablet or smartphone to fully plan their trips while 44% used a mobile device to search for information regarding a future trip. Of the 44% who use mobile devices to plan their travel, 44% preferred using an application to do so.As mobile penetration is slated to increase in the future, we expect to see a higher proportion of online travel searches done using mobile devices. If TripAdvisor in unable to keep up with rapid innovation in this space, it faces the risk of losing out a growing user base of online travel searches via mobile devices.TripAdvisor's Mobile User BaseAs of Q4 2012, TripAdvisor had around 45 million monthly unique mobile device visitors, a y-o-y increase of 190%. At the end of the quarter, it reached over 31 million cumulative smartphone and tablet application downloads for the TripAdvisor application.

Rising traffic, a strong member base and  increasing content across its growing global footprint have helped the  company perform well. While there are certain factors that can limit growth in 2013 such as  a mix shift toward international markets, increasing hotel shoppers on  mobile devices, and lower click-based pricing, we believe that  TripAdvisor is well-positioned to continue expanding its business in the  future.TripAdvisor's business model is primarily driven by the number of  unique visitors to its website, and thus an increase in the number of  visitors in an important indicator of its future growth.

For full-year 2012,  an increase in hotel searches contributed to 20% revenue growth, 18%  click-based revenue growth, and 9% adjusted EBITDA growth.Advertising revenue, which primarily consists of click-based  advertising, contributes over 84% to TripAdvisor's valuation, as per our  estimates. As TripAdvisor targets growth outside the U.S., we feel as if  it can witness higher growth in hotel shoppers as the hotel industry in  the international markets offer better growth opportunities compared to  the U.S. market, which is nearing saturation. TripAdvisor claims to be witnessing continuous growth in  international hotel shoppers and better year-over-year pricing. We estimate the  trend to continue in 2013 as well.Strong Growth in Global TrafficIncreasing international expansion was an important factor leading to  a robust increase in traffic on TripAdvisor's website. With more than  75% increase in traffic, Asia-Pacific was one of the fastest growing  markets for the company. Though the U.S. and the U.K. are relatively mature  markets, TripAdvisor claims to be witnessing healthy growth from these  regions, which implies that there is still room left to grow here.Over 60% of TripAdvisor's traffic originates from outside its core  markets of the U.S. and the U.K. In 2013, the company intends to focus on  enhancing the TripAdvisor brand image in the emerging markets by  incorporating more local language content to drive higher user  engagement.

1313301,46531,2013-04-01T19:41:00-04:00,,"With more than 200 million unique monthly visitors and over 100 million reviews and opinions, TripAdvisor(NASDAQ: TRIP) has become the world's largest travel platform. But is there more room for growth? We try to answer this question by making a complete stock report. The article is divided as follows: 1) Business Overview, 2) Business Model, 3) Momentum, 4) Competitors, 5) Management, 6) Valuation, 7) Growth and 8) Conclusions.1) Business OverviewTRIP is a 1,600 people online travel media platform founded in 2000, with strong presence in Europe and the U.S., and active presence in more than 30 countries.Its platform features reviews and opinions (mainly user generated content) about destinations, accommodations, restaurants and other travel-related issues. Brands include: tripadvisor.com in the US, daodao.com in China and 19 other travel media brands.As of January 2013, 200 million unique monthly visitors (Source: Google Analytics, worldwide data) made (according to comScoreMedia Metrix research for TripAdvisor sites) TRIP the largest travel media platform on the Internet.Key Level Facts- 30 countries, 21 languages- 670,000+ hotels and accommodation pages (July, 2012)- 200 million unique monthly visitors ( comScore Media Metrix for TripAdvisor Sites, worldwide, January 2013) - 44 million registered email-able members (July, 2012)- 75 million user-generated reviews (July, 2012) - Revenue: Aprox. $45 per 1,000 page views,Key Growth Facts2) Business ModelTRIP obtains revenue from cost per click advertisement, subscription services and display ads (impressions). Main clients include travel agents like Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN), as well as travel vendors. Since TRIP's traffic is both highly targeted and massive, it is regarded as a top advertising platform in the travel industry. Thus, a vast amount of travel vendors and tourism offices around the world have TRIP as their main source of traffic.TripAdvisor has benefited from this position by increasing revenue in the high 20s for the past 4 years, currently standing at $763 million (2012) with an average operating margin above 40%.We identify 4 key points in TRIP's business model:a) Traffic based: All the revenue is highly dependent on the ability of TRIP to deliver massive targeted traffic to its clients.b) Not-capital intensive: User generated content is free and also regarded as the best source of information when it comes to service reviews. This allows TRIP to enjoy both high margins, making them able to convert as much as 30% of their annual revenue into free cash flow.c) Economies of scale: Due to its size, TRIP has fixed cost advantages (like infrastructure and negotiation power with clients). Its leading position allows it to attract user generated content easily, as users tend to choose high traffic websites to write their reviews. TRIP is well aware of the importance of keeping a leading position in the industry and has labeled the 2013 key theme as: ""TripAdvisor everywhere,"" a plan to further increase its traffic by strengthening its travel-specific brand portfolio, improving its mobile services and targeting emerging economies.d) It provides value for both users and vendors, creating a sustainable win-win situation: To keep its high quality traffic active, TRIP addresses all phases of the travel cycle: the ""dreaming"" phase when users check TripAdvisor's best travel choices or surveys, the ""plan and book"" phase when users check hotel reviews, the ""on the trip"" phase and the ""share experience"" phase, creating a sustainable viral loop.3) Momentum(Graph by Stockcharts | Click to enlarge)At $52.52 a share, TripAdvisor is very close to break once more its 52 week high (28.63 - 53.73, achieved on March 15th, 9 days after it had its ""buy"" rating restated by analysts at Deutsche Bank).Even though shares fell 7% the next day since marketing costs seem to be higher this year (something that will actually add value in the long run)、stock performance has been excellent (25% up since February 13th) after the firm released its above estimates Q4 earnings press on February 13th.We believe that the strong bullish sentiment in the street will remain for the following weeks, with a high probability of TRIP reaching $55-57 per share in the next 5 weeks.Latest news regarding TRIP include:4) CompetitorsWebsites that offer a similar page format and platform to TripAdvisor cannot become major competitors. TripAdvisor's content database size is simply enormous. On the other hand, competitors that offer a localized travel service (e.g. hotels in U.K., tourism in Thailand, etc) do reduce market share. However, TRIP is active in acquisitions. Any early star and possible strong competitor can be bought.Social networks are a major competitor, because of their viral potential and because they easily attract user generated content. Finally, clever search engines that offer a clean and fast service like Google's Hotel Finder and Adioso.com could become formidable competitors in the near future, as they offer something unique, fast and new.5) ManagementUpsides: We believe that management is both committed and capable of maintaining the leadership position of TripAdvisor. They will pursue further growth by strengthening local brands and investing in technology: TripAdvisor everywhere.The presence of CEO and Founder Stephen Kaufer (who owned about 260,000 TRIP common shares in September 2011, valued at $9 million) has been crucial in building TRIP into the largest travel online platform. Both his management style and his share ownership guarantees absolute commitment to the continuous success of the firm.Downsides: Liberty Interactive could own as much as 57% of the voting power through a mix of common stocks and Class B stocks. They would have the ultimate word on all major decisions.6) ValuationValue is driven by expected future cash flows, which in turn are determined mainly by revenue growth and by the return of newly invested capital (assumption: 18%). In our model, we moderately assume that revenue will grow at a 16% perpetual growth rate (Current: 22.93% | Sector average: 16.61%). This is a conservative scenario: if TRIP manages to further expand its network in emerging economies we see a 20% growth rate more realistic. See the next section for more details about this point.Fair value estimate: $56.5 per shareView: OptimisticComparison: 18 analysts offering 12 month price targets for Tripadvisor have a median target of $45.50, with a high estimate of $63.00 and a low estimate of $37.00.

Planning a trip online is a concept that is still relatively new. TripAdvisor already generates 75% of site traffic from international users in 30 countries.b) Consumers will continue shifting from physical travel agencies to online travel platforms: Travel is already dominated by online resources (the Tripbarometer states that only 18% of travelers use a store-front travel agency, while 69% of them review travel websites).c) Management style: Aggressive growth through strategic acquisitions, local brand creation and heavy marketing and technology investments.8) ConclusionsView: OptimisticMain revenue source: AdvertisementMain costs: Marketing, Technology InvestmentMain competitors: Expedia, Priceline.com, Google, Social Networks.Rate: Outperform (March 31st, 2013)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1257561,23479,2013-03-07T17:39:08-05:00,,"Quick TakeTripAdvisor is a leading online platform for travel-related reviews. With a database of over 75 million user reviews and opinions, it is one of the most popular travel review websites. TripAdvisor’s business model is primarily driven by the number of unique visitors to its website and thus an increase in its user base is an important indicator of its future growth. According to comScore, TripAdvisor’s travel community averaged more than 57 million monthly unique visitors in Q3 2o12 and the figure increased by approximately 45% in Q4 2012.The total number of unique visitors per month on TripAdvisor’s websites increased from 32 million in 2008 to 62 million in 2012, as per our estimate. In this article we list the factors/ potential threat that support/mitigate our rationale of TripAdvisor’s user base increasing to ~110 million over our review period.See our complete analysis for TripAdvisor’s stock 1. Increasing Investment In The Mobile Platform To Leverage Growth In Mobile DevicesWith the rapid adoption of smartphones and tablets, mobile devices are increasingly becoming a preferred and more convenient option for online searches and shopping. According to research firm IDC, mobile travel spend is expected to cross $2 billion by 2014, registering y-o-y growth of above 40%. Additionally, mobile ad spending in the U.S. alone is expected to grow from $1.5 billion in 2011 to close to $10.8 billion by 2016.As per a study last year, commissioned by Expedia and conducted by comScore, around 48% of users use a tablet or smartphone to plan their trips while 44% use a mobile device to search for their next trip, 44% out of which prefer using an application to do the same.TripAdvisor announced the launch of its mobile website in March 2010 and has since added apps for the iPhone, Android, Nokia, Windows phone, as well as the iPad. As of Q4 2012, it had around 45 million monthly unique mobile device visitors, a y-o-y increase of 190%. At the end of the quarter, it reached over 31 million cumulative smartphone and tablet application downloads for the TripAdvisor application. Additionally, TripAdvisor launched 20 news free City Guides across iOS and Android which increased its coverage to 80 cities.2. Tapping Growth In Social MediaAccording to PhoCusWright, Facebook users who are referred to travel booking sites are more likely to make bookings  than those referred via search engines such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). It also reports that more than 75%of the travelers use social networking sites to look for shopping-related deals and 30% specifically look out for travel deals.In 2012, TripAdvisor more than doubled the members acquired through Facebook. At 44 million, its marketable members increased by almost 100% y-o-y. With over 32 million logged-in Facebook users, TripAdvisor’s Facebook app reached the number one spot in terms of monthly active users in Q4 2012 and was the only travel app in the top 20 applications. Presently, 35% of TripAdvisor’s new reviews are derived from its Facebook connected members.TripAdvisor entered into a partnership with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in 2010 and since then has introduced a number of ways to leverage the collaboration. Facebook remains a meaningful channel for TripAdvisor to grow its brand awareness and increase the number of visitors on its websites.3. International Expansion To Fuel Global TrafficTripAdvisor’s increasing international footprint has been an important factor for the robust increase in its user base. TripAdvisor’s revenue contribution from international markets, excluding the US and UK, grew from 18% in 2009 to 35% in 2012. With more than a 75% increase in traffic, Asia-Pacific was one of the fastest growing markets for the company in 2012.With a rising per capita income and low internet penetration (~28%), there is immense growth potential for the online travel market in the Asia-Pacific region. Over 60% of TripAdvisor’s traffic originates from outside its core markets of the US and the UK. In 2013, the  company intends to focus on enhancing the TripAdvisor brand image in the emerging markets by incorporating more local language content to drive higher user engagement.TripAdvisor offers its content in 21 different languages with more than 60 contributions per minute, which equates to over 30 million contributions in a single year.Potential Threats- Fake Review Concerns: Time and again, TripAdvisor has come under scrutiny for authenticity of the reviews on its websites. It has even been investigated by the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) in September 2011 following growing criticism of its apparent failure to monitor fake comments posted on its website. As a result of the investigation, in February 2012, ASA banned the company from claiming or implying that the reviews on its website were from real travelers.If the issue of fake reviews crops up again then it could lead to a potential decline in TripAdvisor’s user base. However, the company claims that it has been dealing with the issue of fake review for over 10 years now, and thus has good expertise at catching people who are trying to spam the system. Additionally, according to a survey conducted by TripAdvisor in 2011, around 98% of its audience trust the reviews on its website.- Increasing Competition: TripAdvisor faces competition in the travel review space from sites such as TravelPost, Yelp and HolidayCheck and from online travel agencies such as Expedia and Priceline, which solicit reviews from travelers who book on their websites. In addition, Google Places, that provides reviews and listings of local businesses, remains a major threat for TripAdvisor. Google has the majority market share in internet searches which gives it an unfair advantage to place its results higher in the search results. This in turn undermines TripAdvisor’s ability to obtain prominent placement in paid or unpaid search results which can impact its traffic growth.- Low Entry-Barrier: Due to the low entry barrier in the industry, Tripadvisor faces competition not only from existing players but also potential new entrants in the travel review market.If TripAdvisor’s user base increases to 130 million by 2019 then there will be a 14% upside to our current price estimate for the company. On the other hand, if the user base increases to only 80 million by 2019, there will be a 24% downside in our price estimate for TripAdvisor.Our price estimate of $38.34 for TripAdvisor is at a discount of over 10% to the current market price.Understand How a Company’s Products Impact its Stock Price at TrefisDisclosure: No positions."
1180811,23479,2013-02-13T14:21:36-05:00,,"Following its spin-off from online travel agency Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) in December 2011, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), a leading online platform for travel reviews, continues to witness rapid top line growth every quarter. Rising traffic and content growth on a global basis has helped the company perform well despite macro-economic headwinds and high operating costs. TripAdvisor will announce its Q4 2012 earnings on February 13, and we expect the company to post another quarter of solid growth.With an expanding user base, improving margins and increasing monetization of social and mobile platforms, we believe the company is well-positioned to leverage future growth in online travel.Rapidly Expanding User BaseTripAdvisor’s business model is primarily driven by the number of unique visitors to its website, and thus an increase in the number of visitors is an important indicator of its future growth. With an average 54 million unique visitors worldwide, TripAdvisor registered a 31% y-o-y increase in visitors in Q2 2012. According to comScore, TripAdvisor’s travel community averaged more than 57 million monthly unique visitors in Q3 2012, a 6% sequential increase.TripAdvisor offers its content in 21 different languages with more than 60 contributions per minute, which equates to over 30 million contributions in a single year. As of Q3 2012, TripAdvisor had over 36 million members, a 70% y-o-y increase. As the company continues to prioritize traffic diversification, focuses on international expansion and targets higher hotel shopper growth, we believe it will continue to register growth in its user base for years to come.Social And Mobile Platforms Remain The Key Focus AreasWith the rapid changes in global technology, it is important for online travel companies to stay in line with changing consumer preferences. With an increase in online penetration globally, consumers are increasingly using online social media such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as a means to communicate and exchange information, including travel information and opinions. On the other hand, with the exponential growth in mobile devices, an increasing number of people are using mobile and tablets to access the Internet.With over 32 million logged-in Facebook users using the TripAdvisor application, it is the second most popular application on Facebook, as per AppData. According to PhoCusWright, Facebook users who are referred to travel booking sites are more likely to make bookings than those referred via search engines such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).Currently, TripAdvisor has around 35 million unique mobile device visitors, and as of September 2012, it reached over 26 million cumulative mobile application downloads for its TripAdvisor application. TripAdvisor intended to roll out hotel meta display to all of its mobile users in Q4, to further fuel growth in mobile traffic. Similar to the flight product, hotel meta display shows partner prices and availability in line, allowing an easy comparison of booking options.Targeting the mobile space and social media, TripAdvisor has been focusing on expanding its avenues to increase penetration and making its platform more accessible to users. We expect both media to contribute significantly toward increasing traffic on TripAdvisor.Pressure On Margins Could Limit Future GrowthTripAdvisor’s general expenses post spin-off have risen considerably. These expenses include costs related to services previously obtained from Expedia, such as accounting, legal, tax, corporate development, real estate and additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company.Additionally, TripAdvisor’s profit margins are likely to be under pressure in the near term due to a decline in per-click commission fee paid by Expedia, which is TripAdvisor’s most significant advertising customer in terms of revenue. Expedia plans to reduce the percentage of gross profit (on bookings generated from TripAdvisor-sourced visitors) that it pays to the company in the future, which is likely to reduce Expedia’s marketing spend on TripAdvisor.However, over time, we expect these expenses to come down, and predict a marginal increase in gross margins by the end of our forecast period. While in Q2 2012 TripAdvisor registered a marginal decline in profits, net income in Q3 2012 registered a robust 9% annual growth.We will update our price estimate of $37.89 for TripAdvisor after the Q4 2012 earnings release.See our complete analysis for TripAdvisor’s stockDisclosure: No positions."
1284471,26861,2013-03-18T18:34:57-04:00,,"In order to develop a basis to invest in any company, it is important to attempt to understand the industry and market that the company's business model addresses. TripAdvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) is the world's largest online travel company (based on user-generated content), empowering users to plan for their travel needs. TripAdvisor's travel research platform aggregates reviews and opinions from its community regarding destinations, accommodations (including hotels, resorts, motels, bed and breakfasts, or B&Bs, specialty lodging, and vacation rentals), restaurants and activities throughout the world.Since TripAdvisor was spun-off by Expedia Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) in December 2011, the stock price has more than doubled. The current environment for the stock market is highly bullish at the moment, so TripAdvisor's stock price growth is not atypical. This analysis will attempt to provide transparency as to what extent TripAdvisor is or can be a leader in the online advertising market within the travel industry. Preliminary assumed factors to consider moving forward include the global macroeconomic environment and the impact on the travel industry, technological advancements, including mobile application development, TripAdvisor's valuation relative to its peers and historical trends, and competitive threats to TripAdvisor's sales growth.This article will address the following components to provide transparency regarding the future prospects for TripAdvisor:Travel Industry - Online AdvertisingAccording to PhoCusWright, gross bookings in the global travel industry are expected to be greater than $1.1 trillion in 2013, with an increasing share booked through online channels each year. In 2012, approximately 59% of U.S. leisure, unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occurred online, compared with approximately 44% of European travel. Online penetration in the emerging markets, such as Asia Pacific and Latin American regions, are estimated to be approximately 20%. Additionally, PhoCusWright estimates that U.S. mobile leisure/unmanaged business travel bookings will more than triple from 2012 to 2014, reaching $25.8 billion.Expedia is the largest online travel company in the world (based on gross bookings). Expedia states that gross bookings which totaled just less than $34 billion in 2012 (16% yoy increase), represent only about 3% of total worldwide travel spending. For 2012, Priceline.com Incorporated (PCLN) was not far behind with $28.5 billion in gross bookings (31% yoy increase), while Orbitz Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE:OWW) was the laggard with just over $11.2 billion in gross bookings (1% yoy decrease). Travelocity, owned by Sabre Holdings Corporation, was taken private in 2007 and claims to have annual gross bookings of more than $10 billion. Combined, these four companies represent roughly 8% of total worldwide travel spending.In 2012, Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), through its primary website property Southwest.com, accounted for approximately 85% of all Southwest bookings, and 84% of Southwest's passenger revenues or roughly $13.5 billion (9% yoy increase). Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) through the Marriott.com web property, claims to have nearly 34 million online visitors each month and property-level gross revenues for 2012 were $8.1 billion (16% yoy increase). Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:WYN) states that the most significant and fastest growing reservation source are online channels, and that since 2007, bookings made directly by customers on their brand web and mobile sites have increased at a five year compound annual growth rate - CAGR of approximately 9%, and increased to over 10 million room nights in 2012. Additionally, bookings made through online travel agencies and other third-party internet booking sources increased at a five year CAGR of approximately 19% to over 13 million room nights in 2012.The research and examples above make it strikingly clear that direct travel suppliers and online travel agencies are experiencing robust growth for web and mobile booking purchases, which are expected to grow in the near-term. The primary benefits for travel industry companies are two-fold; first, establishing stronger relationships with customers is gained through effective booking mechanisms and loyalty programs and second, company operations are maximized by reducing distribution costs.There is a direct relationship with growth in online and mobile bookings leading to higher demand for online advertising expenditures to promote travel products and services. In 2012, Priceline spent over $1.2 billion on online advertising, which represents a CAGR of 55% since 2003. Comparatively, offline advertising expenses have grown at a CAGR of 8% over this same period. Expedia does not break out advertising expense from selling and marketing, yet they spent $1.7 billion in 2012, and attributed most of the year-over-year or yoy increase to online marketing and mobile download spend. Comparatively, Orbitz spent just over $250 million for marketing in 2012, with online marketing spending being significantly greater than offline marketing spending. Direct travel suppliers also contribute a significant amount of advertising expenditures.TripAdvisor derives a majority of revenue from online travel-related advertising and stands to benefit from the demand for online and mobile travel expenditures. While this article will focus on the competitive factors of online travel-related advertising, it is understood that traditional offline advertising remains a competitive threat to TripAdvisor.Competitive LandscapeIn order to compare companies which compete with TripAdvisor it is beneficial to categorize them into groups. There is such a wide variety of online advertising revenue-generating companies for the travel industry, and as a result, these groupings will attempt to include primary competitive threats. These groups will include online travel agencies - Expedia, Priceline, Orbitz, and Ctrip.com International Ltd. (CTRP); major search and display advertising - Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU); direct online advertising - Yelp, Inc. (NYSE:YELP) and Travelzoo Inc. (NASDAQ:TZOO); and other - Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN), and HomeAway, Inc. (NYSEARCA:AWAY-OLD).TripAdvisorTripAdvisor derives revenue from three segments which include Click-Based Advertising, Display-Based Advertising, and Subscription-Based, Transaction, and Other. Click-based advertising is usually priced on a cost-per click, or CPC basis, with payments from advertisers based on the number of users who click on each type of link - this segment represents TripAdvisor's largest source of revenue and includes online travel agencies and direct suppliers in the hotel, airline, and cruise product categories. Display-based advertising is typically sold on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM basis; this segment includes predominantly direct suppliers in the hotel, airline, and cruise categories and online travel agencies and also includes marketing organizations, casinos, resorts, and attractions, and advertisers from non-travel categories. Subscription-based, transaction, and other revenue mainly includes advertising via a subscription model sold for a flat fee per time period and vacation rental fees to list properties on website properties.TripAdvisor's business similar to all online travel agencies is seasonal with the fourth quarter being the lowest revenue generating quarter. For the year, TripAdvisor generated roughly $763 million (20% yoy increase) in revenue with 77% derived from click-based advertising, 12% display-based advertising, and 11% subscription and other. The underlying operating metric driving TripAdvisor's advertising value is the travel-related content generated by users through travel review contributions; to date the company just achieved a significant milestone reaching 100 million reviews and opinions and is currently growing at 15% compound quarterly growth rate - CQGR. TripAdvisor's travel content includes 670,000 hotels and accommodations, 1 million restaurants, 250,000 attractions, and 120,000 destinations, globally, as well as 44 million Facebook users, and 45 million mobile device unique monthly visitors.As of 2012, 51% of TripAdvisor's revenue comes from the U.S. and has grown at a CAGR of 16% since 2009. All other countries revenue at 35% has grown at a CAGR of 61%, and U.K. revenue at 14% has grown at a CAGR of 38% during the same period.Online Travel AgenciesExpedia, Priceline, and Orbitz primarily generate revenue through gross booking transactions. However, both Expedia and Priceline are growing travel-related review content similar to TripAdvisor. Additionally, both Expedia and Priceline have acquired metasearch businesses Trivago, and Kayak.com respectively. These steps pose a threat to TripAdvisor's business model in attracting users from both web and mobile platforms.As of 2012, 55% of Expedia's revenue comes from the U.S. and has grown at a CAGR of 5% since 2004. All other countries revenue at 45% has grown at a CAGR of 24% during this same period.As of 2012 for Priceline, the Netherlands represented 51% of revenue and has grown at a CAGR of 69% since 2009. U.S. revenue at 32% has grown at a CAGR of 4%, while U.K. revenue at 9% has grown at a CAGR of 24%, and other countries revenue at 8% has grown at a CAGR of 124% during the same period. Additionally, 82% of Priceline's gross bookings come from international countries; this segment has grown at a CQGR of 6.5% since March 2011. Expedia does not break gross bookings out by geographies; total gross bookings have grown less than 0.5% since March 2011.As of 2012, 72% of Orbitz's revenue comes from the U.S. and has grown at a CQGR of less than 0.5% since March 2011. International revenue at 28% has grown at a CQGR of 0.5% over the same period.Ctrip.com provides similar booking service products as Expedia, Priceline, and Orbitz including hotel reservations, air-ticketing, packaged tours, and corporate travel. Ctrip.com's other products and services includes the sale of Property Management System or PMS, and related maintenance service; advertising services representing the sale of banners or sponsorship on websites. It is not discernible as to the portion of advertising revenues that are reflected in this category, therefore no estimates of other product revenues were used.When comparing these three companies' advertising and media and marketing revenues to TripAdvisor, Expedia generated $131 million (16% yoy increase), Orbitz generated $58 million (6% you increase), and Priceline generated just over $13 million (12% yoy increase). While TripAdvisor has a significant scale advantage at the moment (TripAdvisor's 2012 revenue was 3.8 times all three companies combined), it will be important to continue to track the developments of travel content review and opinion generation and advertising and media and marketing growth for these three companies. Additionally, in 2012, approximately $204 million or 27% of TripAdvisor's revenue was derived from Expedia businesses, and another 21% was derived from another customer totaling 48% of total revenue.Major Search and Display AdvertisingComparing travel-related online advertising revenues against Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Baidu is challenging to say the least. These companies primarily derive advertising revenues from search-related user queries, as well as from other owned web and mobile properties. While there is no way to directly gauge travel-related revenue line items from these companies, we can gain some insight related to global online advertising trends related to these businesses as well as their travel-related products and services.GoogleGoogle has integrated travel products through both acquisitions and internal development efforts. Google purchased ITA Software in 2010, which develops software widely used by domestic and international airlines, online and traditional travel agents, corporate and government-managed booking tools, global distribution systems - GDS, metasearch services, leisure packaging systems, and technology providers. Companies using ITA Software include Air Canada, AirFrance, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Bing, CheapTickets, Fly.com, Hawaiian Airlines, Hotwire, Kayak, MileWise, nuTravel, Orbitz, Southwest Airlines, Star Alliance, United, US Airways, Vegas.com, and Virgin Atlantic among others.Google also acquired Zagat in 2011 and Frommer's in 2012. Zagat is integrated into Google Maps and provides reviews and opinions or crowd-based content similar to both Yelp and TripAdvisor. The purchase of Frommer's has added potential value in increasing advertising revenues through integration with other Google travel products.Internal travel-related products developed by Google include Google Maps, Google Hotel Finder, Google Flight Search, and Google + Local and Google Travel. Hotel Finder provides a similar structure as TripAdvisor with hotel search parameters and reviews and opinions. Included in the review section are links to reviews and opinions from Expedia, Priceline, and TripAdvisor; these third-party reviews are not always identically matched with multiple searches. For Flight Search, Google links flight bookings to direct travel suppliers. Google Travel and Local both provide Google + members the ability to engage socially in travel-related activities. Local specifically provides reviews and opinions in a social environment for friends, groups, and families to gain better insight on making local trip-based decisions whether for restaurant ideas, attractions, etc. Google Travel provides updated travel information and is structured more like Twitter where Google + users can follow travel information. Google + also serves as a general indicator of interest for travel web and mobile properties through ""g+1"" designations.As a very general proxy to travel-related advertising Google's website advertising revenue represented 61% of total revenue (19% yoy increase) and has grown at a CQGR of less than 6% since March 2011.YahooYahoo Travel provides a full menu of travel products and services including travel ideas (travel articles, travel blogs, beach, family, golf, romantic, national parks, shopping, summer, weekend, and winter), travel guides (travel guides and explore trip plans), book a trip (deals, flights, hotels, car rental, vacations, cruises, specials, and vacation rentals), and my travel (my profile, my trips, create a trip, and timetraveler). All Yahoo bookings are powered by Travelocity.Other travel-related products include Yahoo Maps and Yahoo Local. Yahoo Maps provides search parameters for locations and businesses including directions. The site does not provide reviews and opinions of locations, however. Yahoo Local provides a comprehensive city guide, a ""my local"" tab to organize your local city preferences and activities, a city directory, and a city ""neighbors"" tab where locals within a city can discuss a wide variety of topics. Yahoo provides these services via mobile applications as well.Similar to Google, we must assume a general proxy of travel-related advertising revenues. Both Yahoo Maps and Travel generate display and search advertising revenue. As of 2012, Yahoo's display advertising revenue represented 43% of total revenue (less than 1% yoy decrease) and has grown at a CQGR of less than 2% since March 2011. Yahoo's search advertising revenue represented 38% of total revenue (less than 2% yoy increase) and has grown at a CQGR of less than 1% over the same period.MicrosoftMicrosoft utilizes two primary web properties, MSN.com and Bing.com for travel-related services and products. MSN through its Local Edition provides a suite of travel resources including flights, hotels, articles, video, blog, destination guides, and an escape and inspire theme. MSN and Bing are interchangeable as MSN flight and hotel selections are directed to Bing.com and all bookings are redirected to direct travel suppliers or online travel agencies. Bing also includes hotel reviews and opinions by third-parties including TripAdvisor. Bing Maps provide similar travel information for locations, businesses, etc. Reviews and opinions are included by third-parties including OpenTable, TripAdvisor, Urbanspoon, and Citysearch, among others. Microsoft provides these services via mobile applications as well.Bing and MSN generate revenue through the sale of search and display advertising, accounting for nearly all of Microsoft's Online Services Division - OSD segment. As of 2012, OSD revenue represented less than 4% of total revenue (26% yoy increase) and has grown at a less than 6% CQGR since September 2010. While the OSD segment is the second fastest growing segment to the Entertainment and Devices Division, over this same period, the OSD segment has lost a total of $11.4 billion after operating expenses.BaiduBaidu derives advertising revenue from similar web and mobile products as mentioned with Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. Baidu utilizes primary products including web and mobile search, mobile application search, map search, Shenbian (sharing platform allowing users to find restaurants based on locational preferences), and Qunar (real-time searches on flights, hotels and packages, group-buying deals, visa and other travel-related information to consumers, and Internet and mobile technology solutions to travel industry players) among others. According to iResearch, Qunar ranked No. 1 among travel websites in China and had 74.6 million monthly visits in December 2011; search scope covers over 700 data sources, 150,000 hotels, and 10,000 domestic and international flight routes.For 2012, Online Marketing Services increased 53% yoy to $3.6 billion.SummaryIn order to add a little more information to the major search and display advertising group, the following article by eMarketer provides more details. Google Maps ranks as the top travel website among U.S. Internet users (market share of visits, December 2012). Google Maps also ranks as the top travel-related mobile website visited by U.S. smartphone owners (unique visitors, June 2012) and ranks as the top net U.S. search ad revenue generator, no surprise there. TripAdvisor ranks 5th and 2nd respectively for travel website and travel-related mobile website. When considering the data provided from PhoCusWright and eMarketer, travel-related advertising revenue generated from Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, while not easily discernible, most is significantly more relevant than with Expedia, Priceline, and Orbitz.Direct Online AdvertisingBoth Travelzoo and Yelp derive most if not all of their revenue from online advertising. Additionally, each company provides detailed revenue line item segments.TravelzooTravelzoo states that revenues are advertising revenues consisting of listing fees paid by travel, entertainment, and local businesses to advertise offers on Travelzoo's media properties. Listing fees are based on audience reach, placement, number of listings, number of impressions, number of clicks, number of referrals, or percentage of the face value of vouchers sold, including mobile applications.The travel revenue category includes the publishing revenue for negotiated high-quality deals from travel companies, such as hotels, airlines, cruises, or car rentals and includes products such as Top 20, Website, Newsflash, Travelzoo Network as well as Getaway vouchers. The sales category of revenue includes comparison shopping tools for consumers to compare airfares, hotel and car rental prices, and includes SuperSearch and Fly.com products. The Local revenue category includes publishing revenue for negotiated deals from local businesses, such as restaurants, spas, shows, etc. and includes local deals vouchers and entertainment offers (vouchers and direct bookings); these deals are similar to Groupon and Livingsocial.As of 2012, Travel revenue represented 57% of total revenue (1.5% yoy increase) and has declined by just over 1% CQGR since March 2011. Travelzoo's Search revenue represented 18% of total revenue (6% yoy decrease) and has declined by 1.5%, while Local revenue represented 25% of total revenue (10% yoy increase) and has grown at a 5% CQGR since the same time period.YelpYelp generates revenue from local advertising, brand advertising, and other services, including Yelp Deals, Gift Certificates, and partner arrangements.Local advertising programs include enhanced profile pages and performance and impression-based advertising in search results and elsewhere on Yelp's website and mobile application. Brand advertising is generated through the sale of display advertisements (both graphic and text) on their website, including advertisements from leading national brands in the automobile, financial services, logistics, consumer goods, and health and fitness industries. Other services include the sale of Yelp Deals and Gift Certificates, monetization of remnant advertising inventory through third-party ad networks and various partner arrangements related to reservations.As of 2012, local advertising revenue represented 79% of total revenue (87% yoy increase) and has grown by a 17% CQGR since March 2011. Yelp's Brand advertising revenue represented 15% of total revenue (16% yoy increase) and has grown at a roughly 9% CQGR, while Other Services revenue represented 6% (10% yoy increase) and has grown at a 3% CQGR since the same time period.SummaryCombined, Expedia, Priceline, Orbitz, Travelzoo, and Yelp generated just over $491 million in online advertising revenue, or 64% of TripAdvisor's revenue in 2012. In addition, Yelp is the first company to provide a direct comparison with TripAdvisor for display-based advertising in which TripAdvisor generated 4.6 times more revenue during 2012. Display-based advertising for Yelp included a much broader industry client base focus; comparing and tracking quarterly growth rates between these two company line items will be of interest over time. Additionally, Yelp has generated a net of just over 33 million reviews after considering removed reviews from the Yelp platform.OtherThe remaining other companies include Facebook, Homeaway, and OpenTable. These companies all provide services which compete with TripAdvisor less directly, yet have potential to impact TripAdvisor's business over time.FacebookFacebook generates advertising revenue by displaying ad products on the Facebook website or mobile application and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Facebook typically utilizes click-based and impression-based advertisements. Facebook also has data regarding consumer ""likes"" for a wide variety of products and services, including many within the travel industry.As of 2012, advertising revenue represented 93% of total revenue (36% yoy increase) and has grown at a 11% CQGR since March 2011. Despite slowing user trends in the U.S., worldwide monthly active users - MAUs have grown at a 6.5% CQGR, daily active users - DAUs have grown at a 7.5% CQGR, and mobile MAUs have grown at a 13% CQGR over the same period.HomeawayHomeaway has amassed multiple web and mobile properties for apartment rentals including Homeaway.com (U.S., U.K., Germany, Spain, and Australia), VRBO.com, Vacationrentals.com, Ownersdirect.co.uk, Abritel.fr, Homelidays.com, Toprural.com, and Aluguetemporada.com. These properties directly compete with TripAdvisor's Flipkey.com and Holidaylettings.co.uk. On the revenue side, Homeaway competes with TripAdvisor on two fronts, Paid Listings, and display-based advertising within their Other revenue category.Paid Listings customers generally pay for their listings through term periods and pay-for-performance listings are offered to professional managers. Methods to generate listings include sales, search engines such as Google, word-of-mouth referrals, etc. Other revenue includes the sale of display-based advertising, property management software licenses and related maintenance, gift cards and commissions for online registrations, and other property manager services.As of 2012, Paid Listing revenue represented 85% of total revenue (19% yoy increase) and has grown at a less than 5% CQGR since March 2011. Homeaway's Other revenue represented 15% of total revenue (38% yoy increase) and has grown at a roughly 4% CQGR over the same period.During 2012, Homeaway generated $238 million in Paid Listing revenue. TripAdvisor during the same period generated $81 million in Subscription and Other revenue. It is not clear as to the proportion of revenue generated from Flipkey.com and Holidaylettings.co.uk, however, Homeaway claims to have a 710,000 global marketplace paid listings of vacation rentals and TripAdvisor claims to have more than 300,000 properties up more than 50% yoy; TripAdvisor attributes growth in subscription based products to Business Listings and Vacation Rentals. These line item segments should closely be watched moving forward.OpenTableOpenTable's business model is fairly straight forward when compared to many of the previously reviewed companies. Revenue line items include Reservations, Subscription, and Other.Reservation revenues include a fee for each restaurant guest seated through online reservations, and the increase is dependent upon seated diner trends. Subscription revenues include monthly subscription fees (including installation fees for electronic reservation book - ERB hardware including training), and the increase is dependent upon the number of installed ERB systems in restaurants. Other revenues include advertising sales, featured private dining listings, and gift card sales.As of 2012, Reservation revenues represented 56% of total revenue (23% yoy increase) and has grown at a less than 5% CQGR since March 2011. OpenTable's Subscription revenues represented 35% of total revenue (11% yoy increase) and has grown at a less than 3% CQGR, while Other revenues represented 9% of total revenue (1% yoy decrease) and has declined by a less than 0.5% CQGR over the same period. International seated diners have outpaced North America seated diners by over 400 basis points since March 2011 and total seated diners have grown at a 5.5% CQGR. North America installed restaurants have outpaced International installed restaurants by over 200 basis points and total installed restaurants has grown at a less than 4% CQGR over the same period.OpenTable provides a similar comparative revenue line item as Yelp for display-based advertising. Additionally, OpenTable directly competes with TripAdvisor's review and opinion contributions for restaurants. As of 2012, OpenTable diners had submitted more than 15 million restaurant reviews.SummaryAfter considering Facebook, Homeaway, and OpenTable, TripAdvisor still commands a significant lead over the most transparent online advertising segment businesses. Additionally, we can gather that Yelp and OpenTable have generated roughly 48 million reviews compared to TripAdvisor's 100 million. It will be important to continue to monitor the increasing amounts of reviews and opinions from Expedia, Priceline, Zagat, Yelp, OpenTable and other contribution web and mobile platforms.Peer Fundamental AnalysisThe following table provides key financial metrics comparing the previous groups of companies. Based on a lack of analysis data, both Ctrip.com and Baidu were not included in the table. All information within the table is as of March 15, 2013.All items within the table incorporate diluted share calculations and the table term definitions include:ConclusionThere is a very complicated amount of information to consider with respect to online advertising within the travel industry, specifically as it relates to TripAdvisor. Key components to think about moving forward include continued monitoring of appropriate peer revenue line item segments, monitoring of review and opinion contributions primarily with Expedia, Priceline, Google, Yelp, and OpenTable, and further research information trends from PhoCusWright and eMarketer. Any negative shock to the global macro environment would significantly impact the travel industry.Based on the peer revenue analysis I would tend to consider an order of travel-related online advertising ranking as follows:Google has a very well integrated web and mobile platform to continue to grow travel-related advertising revenues and I would think that they will be a significant competitor for the long-term. I do not see Yahoo, Microsoft, and Facebook being as focused or as successful as Google based on their products and existing platforms; also they have other major products to focus on. Homeaway competes with TripAdvisor on a couple fronts and Yelp is the closest company generating reviews and opinions. Expedia will be the most relevant online travel agency, and OpenTable will continue to focus on restaurant reviews and opinions and compete within this fragmented group.From a fundamental perspective, TripAdvisor does not get as high of a ranking. TripAdvisor falls into the bottom tier in five out of the eight categories. Without getting into a ranked list, I would say that TripAdvisor is currently a little ahead of itself from a stock price and valuation standpoint.Overall, TripAdvisor has established a significant focus with user generated review and opinion contributions which have led to strong growth in online advertising revenues. Mobile application growth and integration with Facebook, vacation rental business and business listings are all great developments to get excited about. At current levels, a word of caution should be heeded. As investors, we need to be aware of the size of the pond, who the bigger fish are, and what if any other organisms are morphing into a new unrealized threat.Disclosure: I am long TRIP.

315336,22762,2011-12-21T13:02:17-05:00,,"By Leena RaoIn April, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) announced its intentions to spin off trip reviews site TripAdvisor as a public company. And this morning, TripAdvisor debuted on the NASDAQ under the symbol TRIP. This morning, TripAdvisor is trading at $29. Expedia is trading at $27.72, down 50 percent.TripAdvisor, which was founded in 2000, was originally bought by IAC in for $212 million in 2004. IAC spun off Expedia, which included TripAdvisor, in 2005. With 50 million unique monthly visitors and 20 million members, TripAdvisor is the giant in the travel reviews space. The site publishes 25 new contributions every minute and also features over eight million candid traveler photos. The reviews site operates in 30 different countries, including in China under the site Daodao. IAC chairman and CEO Barry Diller will serve as the TripAdvisor’s chairman.The company appears to be increasing revenues by 30 percent quarterly, although Expedia warned in October that the newly public company’s profit margins “will be under a bit of pressure” as result of the spin-off. The company’s main revenue stream is cost-per-click advertising.As CEO and co-founder Stephen Kaufer explained to us in an interview, the evolution of TripAdvisor into an independent, public company is about “unlocking shareholder value.” Kaufer says that the company will continue to ramp up its social and mobile efforts as a public company in 2012.TripAdvisor debuted an in-depth social personalization effort with Facebook and so far 57 million users have signed up with their Facebook account to receive social recommendations and advice on the reviews platform. “We’re huge believers in getting travel advice from friends,” Kaufer says. While he wouldn’t comment directly on what new social features are in store for the company, he did say that TripAdvisor is looking at further opportunities, especially in mobile, and will continue to look at acquisitions as a way to expand.Vacation rentals has also been another area where TripAdvisor has been expanding. While the company offers 200,000 vacation rental property listings worldwide, TripAdvisor will be looking to build its vacation rentals business in Europe and Asia, says Kaufer.Original post"
843151,24466,2012-09-03T07:02:22-04:00,,"TripAdvisor's (NASDAQ:TRIP) shares have underperformed the market significantly since July, with the price dropping around 24%, while the S&P 500 has increased ~4% during the same period. We believe this drop was mainly driven by monetization issues related to TripAdvisor's focus on improving traffic quality, Google Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) acquisition of Frommers and the Q2 revenue miss. With the concerns already priced into the shares at the current price point, we believe that TripAdvisor offers attractive risk-reward prospects and rate it as a buy.TripAdvisor has made recent changes to its website directed toward improving the experience of both consumers and advertisers. To this end, the company has reduced the number of pop-up windows for consumers and has increased the number of tools provided to advertisers. With TripAdvisor getting paid on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis, this will lead to revenue headwinds for TripAdvisor, as the click-through rates increase with the number of pop-up windows shown. With the recent changes, we believe that from a consumer's perspective, the site will be much more user friendly, while Expedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) and priceline.com Incorporated (PCLN) - the two main advertisers on the TripAdvisor site - will get higher quality leads generated through the site. While this might result in short-term revenue headwinds for TripAdvisor, as low quality traffic doesn't get converted into clicks, we believe that it will be a long-term positive for higher sustainability of the site. We also believe that TripAdvisor can then charge higher CPCs from advertisers, as the book-to-look ratio increases with the thinning out of low quality traffic (traffic that doesn't convert). TripAdvisor has also reduced its SEM spend and reallocated it toward Social Media channels to improve the quality of the traffic on the site. We believe that over the long term, TripAdvisor's advertisers could pay premium ad dollars to convert high quality users from TripAdvisor's websites.Another concern that investors face is an increase in the Google dis-intermediation risk with Google's recent acquisition of Frommers from John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (NYSE:JW.A). Before this, Google had acquired Zagat to push Yelp (NYSE:YELP) from its perch as well. As Google is continuously diversifying its target markets, the original players are also not sitting silent. While Yelp has done good work with its integration in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iO6, TripAdvisor has been working to decrease its overall dependence on Google as a source of traffic. According to ComScore, a market research agency, the percentage of traffic coming to TripAdvisor from Google has declined from around 36% to 28% over the past one-and-a-half years. We believe that this will help lift some of the investor concerns that Google can kill all the traffic to TripAdvisor, as it tries to gain traction with its own products. TripAdvisor with its 75 million reviews has a much bigger scale than Frommers. The MAUs for TripAdvisor is also far greater than Frommers, as 54 million unique users visited TripAdvisor in June, compared to 1.7 million that visited Frommers.We believe that the stock has taken some excessive hits recently with overblown concerns, and an upside correction might well be in place. TripAdvisor's recent strategic decisions will provide value to customers as well as advertisers in the long term, and can result in increasing CPCs. While there may be a short-term ad dollar loss, the sustainability of the website will be maintained in the longer run with a user-friendly interface. This is a move akin to something that Amazon's Jeff Bezos would do with his philosophy of providing value to customers. Furthermore, with Google's dis-intermediation risk decreasing, there are not enough pot-shots to take at TripAdvisor. We continue to believe that TripAdvisor should benefit from an increasing percentage of travel migrating online and high growth in normal travel markets, and therefore rate it as a buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: This article was written by Rahul Agarwal.

376531,22148,2012-02-19T04:09:30-05:00,,"Recent spin-off TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) [see Spin-Off Mania Benefits Alert Investors] had possibly the most disappointing Q4'11 earnings report reviewed so far. The spin-off from Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) offered huge potential as it became independent from the bigger corporation.TripAdvisor provides a travel research platform which aggregates reviews and opinions of members about destinations, accommodations, restaurants and activities throughout the world. In a way, the travel version of IPO filer Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and recent IPO Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI). With 50M monthly users and expanding Facebook interaction, TripAdvisor appeared to provide huge earnings growth potential.Unfortunately though, TripAdvisor provided relatively sanguine guidance for 2012 on the recent earnings conference call. Costs are expected to increase due to higher spending on search engine marketing, but revenue will slow down from 2011 growth. In our opinion, the stock quickly went from an undervalued social media play not appreciated by the market to a big question mark for this year.This year should've been the year this company soars, with it's independence from Expedia. Instead the company expects mid-double digit revenue growth and relatively flat earnings. Quick, somebody remind me of the benefits of being independent. It sure wasn't suppose to be higher costs and less growth. At least the company remains very profitable compared to Yelp and Angie's List.Some good summaries of analyst disappointments following the Q4 2011 report per Forbes blog:Originally the stock slid out of the gate from the spin-off to minor attention to only soar from $24 to $36 within weeks of the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) IPO announcement. The interaction with Facebook, while beneficial, was clearly over-hyped as the Q1 2012 guidance clipped the stock back down to $27. With the stock closing back over $30 last week, any spin-off investors left have been holding on for a wild trip.At current levels, TripAdvisor still provides a better valuation than other recent social media IPOs in Groupon (GRPN) and Zynga (ZNGA). TripAdvisor maintains a respectable 18 forward PE while the others have 24 and 36 PEs, respectively. Neither company expects anything special in 2012, so why pay up for the others? Not to mention the other similar user review services aren't even close to being profitable.With growth in 2013 and beyond expected, TripAdvisor is worth a look once the company proves itself worthy. The company has several catalysts in new China operations, mobile apps, and vacation rentals to make this a multi-year growth story. As an investor not looking for a wild trip, I want to make sure this management team can safely fly this stock as an independent company. Something they haven't been able to do so far.Stay tuned for the ideal ticket price!Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: Please consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

1035861,23479,2012-11-29T13:12:10-05:00,,"Following its spin-off from online travel agency Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) in December 2011, TripAdvisor  (NASDAQ:TRIP), a leading online platform for travel reviews, has seen    significant upside in its stock price. However, since the company’s Q2   2012 earnings release, the stock has been treading lower, though it has  gained momentum post the strong Q3 2012 earnings. TripAdvisor posted  record revenues of $213 million, marking an 18% y-o-y increase, and  registered a robust 9% annual growth in net income in the third quarter.Despite macro headwinds, TripAdvisor expects the growth momentum to  continue this quarter as well. Deriving close to 84% of its valuation  from click and display advertisement, as per our estimate, we believe an  increase in user base is the most important driver for TripAdvisor’s  business. While tapping alternate platforms to expand its user base  could lift TripAdvisor’s stock price in the future, a failure to clamp  down on expenses would put a downward pressure on the stock.Increase In TripAdvisor’s User BaseTripAdvisor’s business model is primarily  driven by the number of    unique visitors to its website, and thus an  increase in the number of  visitors in an important indicator of its  future growth. Currently, the company has an average of 54 million  unique visitors worldwide. According to comScore, TripAdvisor’s travel  community averaged  more than 57 million monthly unique visitors in Q3  2012, a 6%  sequential increase. TripAdvisor offers its content in 21  different  languages with more  than 60 contributions per minute, which  equates to over  30 million  contributions in a single year. As per its  recent earnings call transcript, TripAdvisor now has over 36 million   members, a 70% y-0-y increase. As the company continues to prioritize   traffic diversification, focuses on international  expansion, and   targets higher hotel shopper growth, we believe it will continue to   register growth in its user base for years to come.If the user base increases to 150 million,  instead of the 124 million we currently forecast, there would be 10% upside  in our price estimate for TripAdvisor.Social And Mobile Platform Remain Key Areas Of Focus To Expand User BaseWith the rapid changes in global  technology, it is important for online travel companies to stay abreast  of changing consumer preferences. With an increase in online penetration  globally, consumers are increasingly using online social media such as Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB)  as a means to communicate and exchange information,  including travel  information and opinions. On the other hand, with  exponential growth in mobile devices, an increasing number of people are   using mobile and tablets to access the Internet.Thus, we feel that to further drive up its  user adoption, it is imperative for TripAdvisor to focus on developing  its social and mobile platforms.Social Media – TripAdvisor  entered into a partnership with Facebook in December 2010,  and    launched a setup that allowed   users to receive “Instant    Personalization”  when visiting the site   with an active Facebook    account. TripAdvisor took the partnership a step further with the  subsequent launch of Local  Picks, a Facebook application that provides   restaurant  recommendations from locals and friends. TripAdvisor  recently launched a new application for business owners,  which helps  create a    TripAdvisor tab for their business’ Facebook  Page,  helping them showcase their reviews and accolades on the Facebook  community.According to PhoCusWright,   Facebook users who are referred to travel booking sites are more  likely  to book travel than those referred via search engines such as Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG). With over 32 million logged-in Facebook users using    the TripAdvisor  application, it is the second most popular application    on Facebook, as  per AppData.As TripAdvisor continues to spend on this  medium and intends to further  leverage Facebook’s social content, we  feel the same can be an important driver to expand the company’s  travelers database.Mobile Applications –  Smartphone adoption  around the world is skyrocketing and is  fundamentally changing the way  people get travel advice. According to  IDC, mobile travel spend is expected to cross the $2  billion mark by  2014, registering y-o-y growth of above 40%.  Additionally, mobile ad spending in the U.S. is expected to grow from $1.5 billion in 2011 to close to $10.8 billion by 2016.To leverage growth opportunities in the  mobile space, TripAdvisor has been investing heavily in its mobile  platform. It announced the launch of  its mobile website  in March 2010  and has  since added apps for the  iPhone, Android, Nokia, Palm  smartphones, as  well as the iPad. Currently, TripAdvisor has around 35  million unique mobile device   visitors and, as of September 2012, it  reached over 26 million cumulative   mobile application downloads for  the TripAdvisor application.TripAdvisor intends to roll out a hotel meta  display to all of its mobile  users this quarter to further fuel growth  in mobile traffic. Similar to  the flight product, hotel meta display   shows partner prices and  availability in line, allowing an easy  comparison   of booking options.Pressure On Margins Could Limit Future GrowthTripAdvisor’s general expenses post  spin-off have risen considerably.  These expenses include costs related  to services previously obtained    from Expedia, such as accounting,  legal, tax, corporate development,    real estate, and additional costs  associated with being a publicly    traded company.Additionally, TripAdvisor’s profit margins  are likely to be under  pressure in the near   term due to a decline in  per-click commission fees  paid by Expedia, which   is TripAdvisor’s most  significant advertising  customer in terms of   revenue. Expedia plans  to reduce the percentage  of gross profit (on  bookings  generated from  TripAdvisor-sourced  visitors) that it pays to  the company  in the  future, which is likely  to reduce  Expedia’s  marketing spend on  TripAdvisor.However, over time, we expect these  expenses to come down and predict a   marginal increase in gross margins  by the end of our forecast period. While in Q2 2012 TripAdvisor  registered a marginal decline in profits, net income in Q3 2012  registered a robust 9% annual growth.However, if the company fails to clamp down its expenses and margins  drop down to 46% by the end of our forecast period, it would lead to a  12% decline in our price estimate.Our price estimate of $37.89 for TripAdvisor is almost in line with the current market price.See our complete analysis for TripAdvisor’s stockDisclosure: No positions"
828441,23479,2012-08-26T05:03:57-04:00,,"An increasing number of people have been turning to online travel websites for making a more informed travel decision. TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is one such platform that provides travel related reviews, aggregating around 75 million reviews and opinions about destinations, accommodations, restaurants and other activities. With close to 56 million unique monthly visitors, 32 million members and 22 million mobile application downloads, TripAdvisor's global community is growing strong.However, lately, the authenticity of the reviews on TripAdvisor's website has once again come under scrutiny. TripAdvisor was even investigated by the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) in September 2011 following growing criticism of its apparent failure to monitor fake comments posted on its website. As a result of the investigation, in February 2012, ASA banned the company from claiming or implying that the reviews on its website were from real travelers.We estimate TripAdvisor to derive over 91% of its value from its advertising division. A substantial decline in the number of visitors on the company's website could have an impact on revenues earned through click-based and display-based advertising, thus leading to a decline in its stock value.See our complete analysis for TripAdvisor's stockTripAdvisor's founder and CEO, Stephen Kayfer, claims that the company has been dealing with the issue of fake review for over 10 years now, and thus has good expertise at catching people who are trying to spam the system. Additionally, according to a survey conducted by the company last year, around 98% of its audience trust the reviews on its website. However, not many users seem to be satisfied with TripAdvisor's stance on fake reviews and feel that it is not taking any significant steps to curb them. Here, we try to analyze the potential impact of fake review on our current price estimate of $35.18 for TripAdvisor.Decline In Unique Visitors To TripAdvisor's SitesUnique visitors to TripAdvisor sites (per month) has almost doubled, increasing from 32 million in 2008 to about 65 million by the end of 2011. With the company's growing focus on expanding in social media and extending its presence in the Chinese market, we estimate the number of unique visitors (per month) to grow at a CAGR of 8% till the end of our forecast period.However, the increasing buzz over the web questioning the accuracy of the content on TripAdvisor sites, can weigh on the growth in its user base. If the number of unique visitors (per month) reaches only 100 million by the end our review period, that will account for a 15% downside to our price estimate.Rapid Decline In Page Views Per VisitorIf TripAdvisor's brand image is tarnished  by the growing concern over fake reviews, there can also be a possible  decline in its page views per visitor per month.TripAdvisor faces competition in the travel  review space from sites such as Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and HolidayCheck and from  online travel agencies such as Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline  (NASDAQ:PCLN), which solicit reviews from travelers who book on their  websites. Thus, we forecast a slight decline in page views per visitor  by the end of the review period.However, if the page views decline at a  higher pace than we currently estimate, then it could have a bigger  effect on TripAdvisor's stock price. If the page view per visitor  decline to 12.3 per month, then we can see a 10% downside to our price  estimate.Social Media Platforms Can Increase Quality Of Online ReviewsSocial media platforms show recommendations based on social connections which often have less anonymity, thus offering better quality of reviews. TripAdvisor entered into a partnership with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in late 2010 and launched a setup that allowed users to receive ""Instant Personalization"" when visiting the site with an active Facebook account. Using the system, TripAdvisor users can check out their friends' travel experiences before planning their own trip. Additionally, it recently launched ""Local Picks"", a new Facebook application which provides restaurant recommendation from friends and other local residents.TripAdvisor currently has over 32 million logged-in Facebook users using its application. We feel that the company's commitment in improving the social travel planning experience can help increase user contribution and improve the quality of its content on its sites.Our price estimate of $35.18 for TripAdvisor is almost in line with the current market price.Disclosure: No positions"
1075951,23479,2012-12-20T15:35:24-05:00,,"TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is a leading online platform for travel-related reviews. With a database of over 75 million user reviews and opinions, it is one of the most popular travel review websites. TripAdvisor spun off from online travel agency Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) in December 2011 and its stock price has increased significantly since then, from $27 in December 2011 to the current level of around $44. We feel the spin-off was a good move as it gave TripAdvisor an opportunity to unlock its value fully, given the different nature of the two businesses.Here we provide a quick snapshot of how TripAdvisor makes money, the important segments that contribute to its business and the key trends that impact its current valuation.See our complete analysis for TripAdvisor’s stockWho are TripAdvisor’s key customers? How does the company make money?TripAdvisor’s services are used by million of users around the world to make informed travel decisions. As difficult macro conditions impact the travel industry, users are more likely to depend on word-of-mouth and online reviews before making a travel purchase. TripAdvisor plays a key role in simplifying its users’ travel decision by providing them easy access to reviews on various travel products.TripAdvisor’s services are free for users. It derives a majority of its revenue from advertising, primarily through click-based advertising and to a lesser extent display-based advertising. Hotel owners, airlines and cruise packages are its main advertising customers. Recently it has added destination market services, casinos as well as other non-travel related categories as its potential advertising customers. The remainder of TripAdvisor’s revenue is generated through a combination of subscription based offerings, content licensing and its recently launched private sale site, SniqueAway.What are the important segments that contribute to its growth?Historically, TripAdvisor’s revenue has increased at a rapid pace. The company made close to $640 million in 2011 and earned 52% operating profit on the same, which is constant across its business segments.  More than 90% of TripAdvisor’s revenue comes from display and click-based advertising with the remaining (<10%) derived from subscription fees (advertising via classified listings).TripAdvisor earned close to $590 million in revenue from display and click-based ads on its website in 2011. While it might derive majority of its revenue from advertisement, its expanding user base is the most important driver for its business, in our view.  TripAdvisor currently has around 65 million unique visitors who visit approx. 17 pages per month. It earns on average $45 per 1,000 page views, which could increase as TripAdvisor expands its global footprint.Though the subscription revenue for 2011 was only $50 million, we expect it to increase in the future as TripAdvisor leverages its expanding user base and content partnerships.Historically, TripAdvisor’s EBITDA margins have averaged around 53%. After its spin-off from Expedia, TripAdvisor’s expenses have risen considerable as it has to incur costs for services that it previously obtained from Expedia, such as accounting, legal, tax, corporate development and additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company. However, over time, we expect these expenses to come down and forecast a slight increase in margins.Current trends that impact TripAdvisor’s valuation1. Growing concern about the authenticity of reviews – Recently, there have been growing concerns about the authenticity of reviews on TripAdvisor’s websites. TripAdvisor Founder and CEO Stephen Kayfer claims the company has been dealing with the issue of fake reviews for over 10 years now, and thus has good expertise at catching people who are trying to spam the system. Besides, according to a survey conducted by the company last year, around 98% of its audience trust the reviews on its website. [1] Thus, we do not expect fake reviews to impact TripAdvisor’s growing user base.2. Increase in global online penetration – The increase in global online penetration, especially in developing markets, is a favorable trend for TripAdvisor’s business growth. Its growing international reach and expanding user base makes it an attractive option for advertisers. TripAdvisor branded websites include tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the website in 29 countries including China.3. Growth in social media & mobile platform – With rapid changes in technology, the growth of social media and expanding mobile user base are important trends that could increase traffic flow on TripAdvisor’s website. Since the inception of its partnership with Facebook in 2010, TripAdvisor has been looking for new ways to leverage the collaboration. With over 32 million logged-in Facebook users using the TripAdvisor application, it is the second most popular application on Facebook, as per AppData.To leverage growth opportunities in the mobile space, TripAdvisor has been investing heavily in its mobile platform. It announced the launch of its mobile website in March 2010 and has since added apps for the iPhone, Android, Nokia, Palm smartphones, as well as the iPad. Currently, TripAdvisor has around 35 million unique mobile device visitors and, as of September 2012, it has had over 26 million cumulative mobile application downloads for TripAdvisor application.4. Increasing competition – In the travel review business, TripAdvisor faces competition from sites such as Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and HolidayCheck. In addition, it competes with online travel agencies such as Expedia and Priceline (PCLN) which also solicit reviews from travelers who book travel on their websites. Moreover, networks with significant user bases such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (via Google Places) are competing more directly with TripAdvisor by attracting and accumulating user-generated travel reviews and opinions, thereby diverting visitors away from TripAdvsior. Thus, we expect the number of page visits per user to slightly decline in the future.Our price estimate of $37.89 for TripAdvisor is at a slight discount to the current market price.

425691,25631,2012-03-11T09:54:11-04:00,,"TripAdvisor's (NASDAQ:TRIP) recent spinoff  from Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) gave equity investors access to buy up the first  pure-play ""review platform"" stock. This has helped TRIP's shares have a  nice run  since its split in December 2011, as there are always eager buyers to  get exposure to a new and hot sub-sector. I would agree with these buyers  of TRIP that the fundamental value-add of a consumer review is quite  high, especially when it comes to travel destinations and  accommodations.However, looking past all this ""pure-play  review"" hype, there are some fundamental headwinds that TRIP is going to  have to face over  the coming year. 2012 has the potential to be a  transformational year in the internet review industry, which very well  might have been the reason for EXPE's desire to spin off its TripAdvisor  subsidiary in the first place. TRIP is starting to see increasing competition in its bread-and-butter hotel review space, its site traffic is heavily dependent on just 1-2 players, the quality of TRIP's reviews have come into question, and from a valuation perspective TRIP's stock seems to be priced to perfection.PEG: The  travel industry is a relatively mature market, especially in the U.S.  (as admitted by most Street analysts). The OTA business model has been  around for many years, encompassing a broad array of offerings over the  years - airline bookings, hotel bookings, hotel reviews, discounted  deals, etc. This makes sense when you look at the PEG ratios of these  companies which on average are about 0.90x. TRIP, on the other hand, has  a 1.5x PEG ratio with the company trading at 25x forward EPS. Reviews  are not a novelty. Reviews in a mature industry are even less of a  novelty. Yes, Asia and LatAm online travel spending is still expected to  grow at 15% and 32%, respectively, but those two countries are still  small pieces of the overall Online Travel spend pie, 16% and 3%,  respectively. (Source: EXPE and TRIP investor presentations.)DCF:  Do a little work and you can get a decent grasp of the global travel  market size, and then drill down to the online travel ad spend market.  Use this to build a simple top-down model of TRIP. Sparing you too much  detail, assume the global online travel ad market grows at a 20-25%  growth rate (comparable or faster than it has been in the past) over the  next 3 years. Then assume TRIP does not run into any further  competition (w/r/t all threats discussed above) and expands market share  from 9% expected in 2012E (based on TRIP's outlook, which is slower  revenue growth in 2012E vs. 2011) to 10% in 2014E. This equates to  growth rates of 23% in 2012 and then 31% for the next two years (vs. 31%  achieved in 2011). Keep EBITDA margins in the low 40% range, as guided  by management. Using an 11% WACC (accurate WACC calc as of this week)  and a 9x terminal EBITDA multiple, you get roughly to the current TRIP  stock price at ~$31. So if the overall market grows as fast (and faster) as it ever has, and if TRIP continues its same growth pattern as it  has in the past (inherently assuming no new competition), then there's  your perfect $31 stock price.Risk #1: TRIP institutes dividend.Mitigant #1: Short-term lift to stock; does not help structural issues.Risk #2: GOOG entry into hotel reviews not as disruptive as GOOG entry into air bookingsMitigant  #2: GOOG has enormous online presence; Has content via Zagat's and  current proprietary reviews; Hotel Finder experiment site launched à  GOOG just needs to fully execute.Risk #3: Network effect more powerful and the TRIP consumer is more loyal.Mitigant #3: Consumer is always in search for all available options to facilitate lowest price and best value (especially in a slow economy); loyalty is out the window if a better product is introduced.Disclosure: I am short TRIP."

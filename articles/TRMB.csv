(TRMB) is one of those rare tech companies aiming for niche markets instead of the general market. I like companies like these because the barrier of entry to niche markets is low if you’re one of the first but grows taller for your potential competitors once you enter the market. Trimble aims to provide technological solutions to industries that lag behind in technological adaptation (e.g., agriculture), and does so by engaging in large amounts of R&D as well as strategic acquisitions.Niche, established companies such as Trimble have a larger degree of freedom with which to tackle their markets, and are thus arguably better protected against general market risk. Still, exposure to TRMB requires accepting some risk, particularly the slowing worldwide growth in many of the industries that Trimble serves. A couple of the industries with uncertain growth prospects include agriculture (lagging pain from tariffs, droughts in Brazil, etc.) and geospatial businesses (largely driven by China, which is slowing and increasingly uncertain due to potential 2019-nCoV threats).Trimble is set to report its earnings in early February:This stock has a roughly random earnings pattern, meaning that the bulls and bears both win 50% of the time. Being so, why play TRMB for earnings? The expected payoff is the answer: the average upside gain is 8%, while the downside gain is only 4%.Of course, this means we want to play this trade in the long direction. We don’t want to trade during a run-up if the technical pattern is not supportive of a long position or if it implies a bearish reversal, though. To check this, I run a pattern analysis. While there is a wedge up (bearish), we also have a strong up channel with momentum, and my machine learning analysis supports the bulls:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Tiingo)We see an expected 8.6% gain before the pattern repeats with a pullback. See if you can spot the pattern:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Tiingo)Other technical signals are mostly bullish. Based on the candlesticks, we have a breakout potential above the price of $44.22, which is where the narrow range 4 has its high set. We are also seeing higher lows, indicative of lasting upward momentum. Many more technical signs point to a long trade; you can review some on your own at StockTA:(Source: StockTA)However, a company riddled with debt or an increasing debt-to-equity ratio can fall hard on a bad earnings report. We check to see whether this is true of TRMB:(Source: Simply Wall St)In addition, we don’t want to see short interest - especially naked shorts - rising as we head into earnings. While high short volume isn’t always bad due to the possibility of a short-squeeze on earnings, a general trend of increasing short volume can be a hint that earnings will not meet expectations. For TRMB, short interest is rather high but spikes in short volume seem to dissipate rather quickly, as is happening now:(Source: Naked Short Report)Next, we check the seasonal patterns. A business often sees its stock outperform during certain times of the year, and we don’t want to be betting on the wrong side when earnings come around. As we see from TRMB’s seasonal patterns, going long in February has been a strong entry point, further supporting this long trade over the earnings in the month:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Tiingo)Note that the average February gain is roughly 6%, with three out of four Februaries ending in the green. This is roughly in line with the earnings payoffs I described at the beginning of this article: 8% * 0.75 + -4% * 0.25 = 5%, which is almost 6%. This typically implies that my earnings payoff curve is right.That 1% difference can be explained by pre-earnings drift, the habit of a stock rising before good earnings (or falling before bad). Thus, it is often smart to enter a long earnings trade some time before earnings - though you can certainly enter the day before earnings. From the chart above and the pattern analysis, using late January (i.e., now) as an entry point is not dangerous and even boosts the Sharpe ratio in your favor.In general, we see all the signs we wish to see for a long earnings trade. We hedge the downside - in spite of it being less than the upside - via options. Here is my proposed play:An option strategy of this type allows for a special payoff curve, further emphasizing the already strong payoff curve that is in favor of the bulls. One way in which this strategy is unique is the staggering of expiration dates (the same expiration dates for the short and long calls would create a call ratio spread, whereas this is known as a call backspread). By staggering the expiration dates, we do suffer from a couple downsides, namely a lower net credit and a lower potential profit on a rally.However, for quick trades that do not rely on extended rallies, backspreads such as these can maximize your short-term gains. In addition, should we be wrong here, we can write new call options after Feb21 for the next months, creating theta income while we wait for another chance at a rally. This is the primary advantage of this strategy, and it allows us to profit even if TRMB does not rally on earnings.I expect TRMB to rally on earnings, and we have infinite profit potential on the upside. But in the case TRMB does not rally, we can simply write calls against our long calls to still profit. This is all performed without any upfront payment, giving us an exceptional payoff curve on an earnings trade that already has an exceptional payoff curve.Happy trading!"
4359315,40101,2020-07-20T07:00:47-04:00,"When an investment club member requested an analysis of Raven Industries, Trimble once again hit our radar.Raven Industries is a dividend payer with a five-year capital investment plan for 3X the previous five. We are drawn to growth, but, its valuation is rich.Since Trimble doesn't pay a dividend, it wouldn't normally be a candidate for DGI investors like us. But, the pandemic has us bending our rules.","The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted my investment club to adjust our requirements, to bend our rules. Looking at companies through a pandemic lens, a probability of survival becomes a key factor while the possibility of thriving in a ""new normal"" is appealing.We've purposely focused on a DGI strategy. Yet, my investment club seems to always be drawn toward the growth stories, probably because we started our investing journey as GARP (Growth At a Reasonable Price) investors. A few years ago, we opted to focus more on building income. After a small learning curve, we defined criteria to guide our research. We've dubbed our DGI strategy a search for GRAVY - “GR” owth “A”bility, “V”aluation and “Y”ield. We strive to invest in healthy, fairly-valued dividend-payers with clear potential for dividend growth.A club member requested an analysis of dividend-paying Raven Industries (RAVN). It hasn't grown its dividend since 2014 but Raven is touting a growth story. Its business positions it for survival while its growth plans position it to thrive.The dive into Raven led me back to Trimble Inc. (TRMB). I covered Trimble from 2013 through 2016. But, my attention to it slipped when the club's investing strategy changed. Since Trimble didn't pay a dividend, it was no longer an investment candidate for us. And, yet, Trimble is very likely to not only survive but to thrive.An investment recommendation for the club on either company is hardly straightforward. Certainly, there are times when exceptions to rules are necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic may well be one of those times.I have to admit I wasn't familiar with Raven Industries when the request came to offer an opinion. The manufacturer is headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Its first products were high-altitude research balloons. It now focuses on technology solutions to solve challenges faced across several industries such as agriculture, industrial, construction, energy, defense and aerospace. The company operates three business segments – Raven Applied Technology, Raven Engineered Films and Raven Aerostar.Connections between the segments are not immediately obvious until one realizes the solutions were birthed from Raven's research balloon roots. The Applied Technology segment primarily utilizes the logistical, GPS-guidance and autonomous technology to provide precision products and tools to the agriculture industry. The Engineered Films segment grew out of Raven's balloon manufacturing knowledge and serves the agriculture industry as well as the industrial, construction and energy industries.In November 2019, Raven Industries declared its intention to fuel exponential growth through two platforms – Raven Autonomy and Raven Composites. Raven Autonomy will provide autonomous agricultural solutions in the Applied Technology segment. Raven Composites will offer reinforced composites through the Engineered Films segment. It plans to invest three times as much capital through 2024 as it did in the previous five years.SourceThe Applied Technology segment will see the most investment at $400 million while investment in the Engineered Films segment will top $300 million. Overall, Raven expects to allocate over $400 million to acquisitions and $300 million to research and development.In fiscal 2020 fourth quarter, Raven invested over $50 million, making its first foundational steps in building the Raven Autonomy platform. The company acquired Smart Ag and acquired a majority ownership of DOT Technology. Smart Ag offers aftermarket retrofit kits for farm equipment. The kits enable the machinery to be connected, managed and operated autonomously. In March 2020, Raven announced it will acquire the remaining equity of DOT Technology, the designer and manufacturer of a platform allowing the autonomous handling of farming implements.Both companies were considered to be in the technological development stage, which means neither was yet generating revenue.For fiscal 2020 ending February 1, 2020, Raven's sales were $382.5 million. Earnings were $0.97 per diluted share. The company's backlog totaled $60 million. Raven had $20.7 million in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet and credit availability of $100 million.Raven reported fiscal 2021 first-quarter results on May 19th. Revenue declined year over year by 12% to $86.5 million. Though all three segments were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Applied Technology segment did improve sales slightly. The company did manage to generate $3 million more in operating cash in the quarter than in the prior year. Yet, as a precautionary measure relative to the pandemic, Raven opted to draw down $50 million against its revolving credit line. Still, its debt-to-equity ratio is less than 20.Raven pays a dividend of $0.52 per share annually. Although many companies have opted to conserve and protect cash by suspending their dividend payments, Raven's Board did opt to approve its regular quarterly dividend. When its shares are trading below $26, the yield is over 2% but under 2.5% when shares trade over $20.80. It has paid that rate since 2014. It could easily be argued Raven's capital allocation plan points to future dividend increases.Trimble provides positioning, connecting, modeling and analysis solutions. It “connects the physical and digital worlds.”More than half of its sales, 57%, are generated from the sale of technology and services including software as a service. The remainder is generated from the sale of hardware. It serves the agriculture, civil engineering, construction, geospatial, transportation and utilities industries.SourceWhen I last covered Trimble for Seeking Alpha in 2016, the company was focused on three initiatives - grow revenue, reduce costs, improve gross margin. Since then, revenue has improved from $2.4 billion in 2016 to $3.3 billion in 2019. Its recurring revenue stream at the end of 2019 was $1.13 billion on an annualized basis. At the end of 2016, Trimble's gross margin was 56.4%. It had improved to 57.7% by the end of 2019. Operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, were 42% in 2016 and 43% in 2019.Initially, Trimble expected 2020 first-quarter non-GAAP revenue in a range of $780 million to $810 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 to $0.45 per share. On May 6th, it reported revenue of $794 million and earnings of $0.49 per share. Annualized recurring revenue improved to $1.15 billion. Despite a year-over-year slip in revenue, the quarter exceeded expectations.SourceTrimble has $216.8 million in cash and equivalents. Its debt obligation is $1.98 billion and its debt-to-equity ratio is over 65%. In response to the pandemic, the company extended the maturity date on its $225 million term loan from July 2021 to July 2022. It has $1.07 billion remaining on its $1.25 billion revolver.SourceTrimble does not pay a dividend. It did have an active share repurchase program. In the 2020 first quarter, it bought back approximately 1.2 million shares. However, in response to the pandemic and to conserve cash, it suspended future buybacks.The embrace of technology positions both companies to survive and potentially thrive. Trimble's $10 billion market cap positions it as a leader. As well, it is classified as a technology company. Trimble will likely stay on Wall Street's radar. On the other hand, Raven's market cap is less than $1 billion and it is classified as an industrial company. It is not uncommon for a technology company to be valued at a premium to an industrial company.At this point, Trimble has grown both revenue and earnings at a faster pace than Raven over the past three years. As well, Raven’s margins don’t compare well at all to Trimble’s. Raven's gross margin is 32% compared to 58% for Trimble. Net income margin for Raven is 7% compared to 16% for Trimble. On a revenue per employee basis, the two are comparable - Trimble generates $284 thousand while Raven generates $281 thousand. However, Trimble's income is $45 thousand per employee while Raven’s is only $19 thousand. The implication, to me, is Trimble is a much more “efficient” company.It cannot be ignored the two companies are at different points of maturity. Prior to the pandemic, Trimble expected revenue in 2020 to fall in a range of -4% to +1%. Earnings were projected to be flat at the low end of its range and to grow at a mid-single-digit rate at the high end. On the other hand, Raven is actively and aggressively attempting to grow. Considering the current economic environment and considering Raven's intent to grow through acquisition, the company may find itself able to acquire needed bolt-on businesses at better prices than before the pandemic. Comparatively, with its first-quarter reporting, Trimble suspended its pursuit of acquisitions.As previously mentioned, Raven pays a dividend while Trimble does not. Therefore, generating a return with Trimble will rely on share price appreciation. It is currently trading within 10% of its 52-week high. Yet, its forward P/E ratio is just 25, slightly lower than its sector's average and slightly higher than its five-year average. On the other hand, Raven's share price is approximately 40% off its 52-week high. Its valuation based on forward earnings estimates seems rich at a ratio over 62. This rate is more than double the sector's average and nearly 80% greater than the company's own historical five-year average.By browsing a few agricultural industry forums, it becomes evident consumers often use products from both Trimble and Raven. Discussion often centers on interactivity between the two. Yet, a key differentiation between the two companies is Trimble's diversification across so many industries. Should one of its target industries be challenged, it is likely the others may show stability.Choosing whether to invest in Raven Industries or Trimble should typically come down to an individual investor’s investing style and investing time frame. Since Trimble doesn't pay a dividend, it, normally, would not appeal to income or DGI investors. For DGI investors with a focus on growth, such as my investment club, Raven Industries does appear to be a viable candidate. However, its rich valuation is an obstacle.Yet, both companies are now on my investment club's watch list. In this current environment of suspended and eliminated dividends, my investment club was willing to forego the dividend-payer requirement for a company positioned to not only survive but thrive. A surge in infrastructure spending would spur an investment in Trimble. As well, we'll watch for a pull-back in Raven's share price, hopefully by at least 15%.Pandemics may change the rules. At the very least, pandemics create exceptions."

4165413,101421,2018-04-24T18:02:20-04:00,Trimble has agreed to acquire Viewpoint for $1.2 billion in cash.Viewpoint is a leading provider of a suite of construction industry software for companies of all sizes.The deal is part of a bold strategic move by Trimble to position itself for a construction and infrastructure upswing in the years ahead.,"Trimble (TRMB) has announced an agreement to acquire Viewpoint for $1.2 billion in an all-cash deal.Viewpoint has developed a fully integrated construction software suite for construction companies of all sizes.TRMB is acquiring Viewpoint as part of a larger strategy to focus on construction management as the industry continues its transition to digital technologies.Portland, Oregon-based Viewpoint was founded in 1976 to provide construction-specific solutions to companies seeking to improve productivity, reduce costs and project results.Management is headed by Chairman and CEO Manolis Kotzabasakis, who has been with the firm since August 2015 and previously held senior positions at Aspen Technology.Below is an overview video of Viewpoint:(Source: Viewpoint)Viewpoint’s primary offerings within its software suite include:Its software is used in several construction-related subgroups such as General Contractors, Specialty Subcontractors, Heavy/Civil Contractors and Owner Operators.In April 2014, Bain Capital Private Equity acquired a sizeable stake in Viewpoint for $230 million from two existing investors, Updata Partners and TA Associates.The deal was considered a relatively small size for the private equity arm.According to a 2017 market research report by Technavio, the global construction software industry was expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.70% from 2017 to 2021.The main drivers for this forecasted growth are a demand for construction management software in the APAC region as well as within the utilities sector, according to a Research and Markets report.Major competitive vendors that provide construction software include:There are numerous other smaller providers of various suites and subsets that the major vendors including Viewpoint sell.Trimble is paying $1.2 billion in an all-cash deal, which it expects to be funded through cash on hand and new debt.TRMB’s most recent 10-K indicates that as of the end of 2017, the firm had $537.4 million in cash, equivalents and short-term investments and total liabilities of $1.93 billion.Management did not disclose the breakdown of cash vs. new debt, but it appears the firm has adequate resources to close the deal without undue hardship. Trimble currently has a market cap of $8.84 billion relative to this $1.2 billion acquisition.Trimble is acquiring Viewpoint as a complement to its existing construction software unit and its recent acquisition of e-Builder for $500 million. The e-Builder deal was also an all-cash deal financed by a combination of cash on hand and new debt.As Trimble CEO Steven Berglund stated in the deal announcement:TRMB’s stock has been volatile on the announcement as the chart below indicates:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Although the news was initially positively received by public investors, it was subsequently caught in the larger market downdraft as a result of 10-year Treasury interest rates reaching the 3% level.Management expects the deal to be ‘accretive to Trimble’s operating cash flow in 2019.’The transaction appears to make strategic sense as Trimble builds out its construction management offerings. With the generally favorable environment for infrastructure and other construction projects in North America, many firms are jockeying to position themselves to take full advantage of the prospects for increased spending.The construction industry needs to continue its move to the cloud and the adoption of efficiency-generating technologies and we are still very much in the early days of that process.I view the deal as a medium-term strategic plus for Trimble as management makes the necessary bold moves to improve its position in the industry."
4379510,21702,2020-10-16T18:16:01-04:00,"Trimble's top-line revenue growth trajectory was interrupted by the impact of COVID-19.However, the long-term investment thesis is still intact and I like the company's shift to a higher recurring revenue base.The company continues to innovate and diversify its sources of revenue - both of which make its enterprise more resilient.All that said, COVID-19 has impacted the growth trajectory the company was on, and it may be a year before it gets back on track.","Over the past few years, Trimble (TRMB) has demonstrated solid revenue growth: from $2.3 billion in 2015 to $3.3 billion in 2019. The trajectory came grinding to a halt in Q2 when revenue dropped 14% yoy as the impact of COVID-19 on the company's two largest business segments - Buildings & Infrastructure and Transportation - were hit hard. In the near-term, these businesses will likely stay challenged and present a headwind for a higher stock price. That said, the long-term investment thesis of the company is still intact: innovation, growth through M&A, and a larger recurring revenue base.From the Q2 EPS report, the revenue impact on Trimble's four business segments is clear:As a result, overall revenue was down 14% from Q2FY19 and EPS dropped from $0.37 to $0.25 per share yoy.However, there was some good news. Cost-cutting efforts led to an increase in gross margins from 53.9% to 55.3% and annualized recurring revenue for Q2 was $1.21 billion, +6% yoy. In addition, adjusted EBITDA of $189.3 million was down only 5% as compared to Q2FY19.FCF generated in Q2 was $134.6 million. Long-term debt at the end of Q2 was $1.56 billion, down from $1.62 billion at the beginning of the year. Cash at the end of the quarter was $196.4 million - up $7.2 million from the end of the previous quarter.Net-debt to TTM EBITDA was 2.2x and there are no debt principle debt payments due until July 2022. So despite the COVID-19 impact on revenue, the company was free-cash-flow positive over the first six months of the year and was paying down debt, raising cash, and actually bought back $50 million in stock during the quarter after suspending buybacks during Q1. The bottom line is that the balance sheet is strong, the company is free-cash-flow positive and more debt reduction is likely in the second half of the year.On the Q2 presentation the company reported a $1.2 billion backlog (up yoy) and $1.8B in TTM software, services and recurring revenue, both of which in my opinion are bullish going forward. That's because the backlog is strong and represents contractual commitments that management expects the majority of which will be recognized as revenue within the next 12-months. The recurring revenue base continues to grow and makes for a more resilient company with higher margins:Source: Q2 presentationNote that recurring revenue and software sales now greatly exceed hardware revenue (in 2008, hardware was 89% of revenue; in 2013 - 61% came from hardware). The continuing trend in recurring revenue growth is a primary investment catalyst for Trimble and CEO Rob Painter said on the Q2 conference call:For Q3 the company expect continued growth in recurring revenue, but a continued yoy decline in total revenue, but not as bad as Q2. Gross margins are expected to increase due to more software revenue.The company's strategy and investment thesis remains firmly intact. In the words of the CEO the strategy is ""delivering breakout innovation that connects the physical and digital worlds."" So whether that is in analytics, using the IoT for remote monitoring of wastewater infrastructure, or its new machine control Platform-as-a-Service product line, Trimble is innovating and disrupting markets. Given its strong balance sheet, the company will likely announce more acquisitions to accelerate its strategy. As a result, debt reduction will likely be prioritized over share-buybacks in terms of cash allocation - at least over the near-term.Trimble has been around since the 1970's and I'll always think of the company as satellite-based ""Trimble Navigation"" that made cool mobile GPS devices. And it still does:Source: TrimbleBut the company is obviously much more than that these days. That's a good thing because hardware sales continue to decline and higher margin software sales are offsetting these declines and delivering higher margins in the process.Given Trimble's strong balance sheet and its ability to generate FCF in a tough business environment, the primary business risk is the continued negative impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and perhaps Trimble's ability to source parts from China through the supply chain - and tariffs could also play a role in that regard. The economy generally affects Trimble's two largest segments ( Buildings & Infrastructure and Transportation) the hardest. As a result, the company's revenue will likely remain under pressure until the global economy more fully recovers from COVID-19.Trimble's strategic plan is spot-on. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has hit them hard and it appears the company's growth trajectory will continue to be affected in the coming quarters, certainly for Q3. Considering the TTM P/E=27, and Seeking Alpha's FWD P/E=26, the stock does not appear to offer excellent potential for growth over the coming year. I think investors can wait for another couple of (tepid...) quarterly reports and take a fresh look at the company come Spring of 2021."

Management is correct to acquire the necessary building blocks or capability expansion to stay on top of these changes if that is what it takes to do so.Internal development can only proceed so quickly, and companies that aren’t nimble enough to make smart acquisitions under strategic imperatives will quickly lose ground to those who do.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

As of the second quarter of 2019, Software/Services/Recurring equaled ~55% of total revenues, while Hardware revenues accounted for ~45%.Since the second-quarter of 2017, geographic revenue contribution from the Asia-Pacific region has declined -3.2%, compared to North American region growth of +4.3%. In comparison, other regions outside the U.S., saw smaller decreases in revenue contribution as Europe declined -0.7% and Rest of the World (ROW) declined -0.4%. On the company’s second-quarter earnings call, Trimble management noted that the Asia-Pacific region alone accounted for a -16% headwind, driven by difficulties in China, with other markets mixed. In our opinion, this commentary seems to properly define the company’s headwinds over the last two years driven primarily by the Asia-Pacific region.Overall Asia-Pacific contribution to total company revenues has declined across all segments over the last two years. In 2017, the company reported Asia-Pacific region revenues equaled 14.3% of total company revenue, while it accounted for only 10.5% in the second-quarter of 2019. This decline over the last two years reflects a broad impact from the U.S.-China trade dispute, which could potentially see some relief, or even reversal, if any type of agreement may be reached in future quarters. An agreement, simply on China buying more U.S.-based agriculture products, would likely boost the company’s China, and Asia-Pacific revenues, but also positively impact the North American agriculture business, which has seen a pause in recent quarters, as farmers have pulled back on spending even with government subsidies. Based on our current estimates, we anticipate 2019 will be the low for Asia-Pacific revenue contribution since 2017.As of 2018, Trimble end-market customers have already begun transitioning away from hardware-based products. In several key end-markets, such as Buildings & Infrastructure, along with Transportation, the company has already seen a material shift, with software/services/recurring already representing >50% of revenues. At the company’s 2018 Investor Day, management noted that Resources & Utilities captured >40% of its end-market revenues from software/services/recurring. We believe this figure is now likely close to, or already has surpassed, the 50% contribution level, in 2019. On the company’s second-quarter earnings call, management noted that it does not see Trimble as a 90% software company at any point in the future. It could, however, become a business with a “6” in front of it in terms of total revenue contribution in future years.Even with the company’s long operating history, Trimble remains underpenetrated in several key end-markets, as it shifts the model towards software/services/recurring revenues. Per Trimble, its TAM (Total Addressable Market) equals ~$50B, which is the total of all end-markets served by Trimble products. As of 2018, the company has penetrated ~6% of the projected addressable markets. This suggests to us, that Trimble could potentially capture an additional 5-15% penetration in end-markets over the coming years, bringing its potential penetration to ~11-21%, which would suggest future year revenue potential of ~$5.5-$10.5B. This compares to the ~$3.3B consensus revenue estimate for 2019.Assuming the mid-point of our estimated additional end-market penetration for Trimble in key markets, ex-Geospatial implies potential revenues of ~$8B. If the company achieved this mid-range estimated penetration in roughly the next nine years, it would imply a potential 10yr revenue CAGR (’18-‘28E) of ~10%, which would be near the low-end of the company’s current estimated total potential growth rate. With potential for sustained organic and total revenue growth, forecasted by management in the coming years, coupled with estimated increasing levels of penetration in ~90% of its addressable markets, suggests to us Trimble may be much closer to a bottom than top at current levels, given its future opportunities.The Sentieo Management-Analyst Sentiment Index seeks to track the trend in sentiment between company management, and the analysts covering the company. When this signal raised a warning sign relative to Trimble, Inc., in early 2018, every quarter following the first-quarter of 2018 has missed consensus revenue expectations. The company’s overall optimism spread between management and analysts declined significantly around the initial announcement of Chinese tariffs in mid-2018. When this occurs, and the sentiment spread is negative, management may be more cautious, while analysts remain bullish, creating the potential for future earnings disappointments. However, recently the overall spread between management and analysts’ optimism has now narrowed and reached a point during the second-quarter which suggests future expectations from management and analysts may be more in-line. In our view, this could create the potential for future upside if management can execute and may provide investors another tailwind into our future estimated growth in 2020 and beyond following the headwinds from the Asia-Pacific region over the last two years.YTD, shares of Trimble are up ~12% as of September 3rd, 2019. While shares have appreciated YTD, they have underperformed versus the Total S&P 500 Index by >6%. We see multiple catalysts in front of the company likely changing this underperformance during 2020-2021. With shares down ~20% from recent 52-week highs ($46.25) we see the current valuation of future opportunities as mispriced. We anticipate steady revenue growth of ~9-10% in coming years, with expanding non-GAAP EBITDA margins, and non-GAAP EPS growth which outpaces revenue, due to operating leverage as the company shifts towards software/services/recurring revenues. Based on current consensus estimates for 2019 non-GAAP EPS ~$1.94, shares are currently trading at a premium to comparable companies NTM (next twelve months) P/E by ~5.5%. However, by 2020, using consensus estimates of ~$2.16, the NTM P/E multiple is forecasted to be below comparable companies (see Appendix for comparable companies).Utilizing our current 2021E non-GAAP EPS figure of $2.75, applying a 20x NTM P/E multiple, which would be a ~11% premium to current comparable companies at ~18x, we see shares of Trimble potentially trading towards $50-55/share in the coming years, which would imply possible upside potential of ~45-50% from recent share price of $37.00.Since the second-quarter of 2017, geographic revenue contribution from the Asia-Pacific region has declined -3.2%, compared to North American region growth of 4.3%. In comparison, other regions outside the U.S., saw smaller decreases in revenue contribution as Europe declined -0.7% and Rest of the World (ROW) declined -0.4%. On the company’s second-quarter earnings call, Trimble management noted that the Asia-Pacific region alone accounted for a -16% headwind, driven by difficulties in China, with other markets mixed. In our opinion, this commentary seems to properly define the company’s headwinds over the last two years driven primarily by the Asia-Pacific region.According to management the headwinds from the Asia-Pacific region are due to a decline in Chinese-based OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) hardware revenues. On the company’s second-quarter 2019 earnings call, Trimble management noted that excluding China, the Asia-Pacific region was up +7% year-over-year during the second-quarter of 2019. This was down slightly from the ex-China year-over-year growth of 10% in the first quarter of 2019. During the first-half 2019, China-based revenues were down -40% year-over-year, per Trimble management, with China now accounting for ~2% (2Q19 @ 2%: $1.8m) of total company revenues. Trimble believes declining growth and contribution from China in the last year is due primarily to the intensification of the Chinese government policies which have created explicit preferences for Chinese companies over non-Chinese companies.Per Trimble’s second-quarter 10Q filing, the negative impact from China has been primarily related to ongoing weakness in the company’s Geospatial OEM hardware sales to Chinese-based customers. Contribution to total company revenues from the Geospatial segment has declined from 24.9% in the second-quarter of 2017 to 19.2% in the second-quarter of 2019. But on a dollar contribution basis, revenue has remained essentially flat over the last two years (2Q19: $165m vs. 2Q17: $164m). If contribution percentage from Geospatial had remained flat from the second-quarter 2017, segment revenues would have been ~$90m higher than reported during the first-half of 2019, and ~$57m higher in 2018. We are unsure how much of this decline in Geospatial revenue Trimble can recapture in future years, but even with some capture, we estimate hardware revenue contribution declines as a percentage of total revenues. Thus, any capture, or upside in China-based OEM hardware revenues in future years, could offer positive contribution to our total revenue estimates.Overall Asia-Pacific contribution to total company revenues has declined across all segments over the last two years. In 2017, the company reported Asia-Pacific region revenues equaled 14.3% of total company revenue, while it accounted for only 10.5% in the second-quarter of 2019. This decline over the last two years reflects a broad impact from the U.S.-China trade dispute, which could potentially see some relief, or even reversal, if any type of agreement may be reached in future quarters. An agreement, simply on China buying more U.S.-based agriculture products, would likely boost the company’s China, and Asia-Pacific revenues, but also positively impact the North American agriculture business, which has seen a pause in recent quarters, as farmers have pulled back on spending even with government subsidies. Based on our current estimates, we anticipate 2019 will be the low for Asia-Pacific revenue contribution since 2017.In prior years, and through the second-quarter of 2018, Trimble’s hardware revenues equaled the vast majority of company revenues. However, beginning in the third-quarter of 2018, the company’s combined software/services/recurring revenue contribution surpassed hardware contribution and has continued to expand in subsequent quarters, compromising most of today’s revenues. For comparison, in 2017, hardware revenues equaled ~52% of total revenues, but by the second-quarter of 2019, this number equaled ~45%. We currently model zero hardware growth from the reported $1,375m in 2017, which we estimate will be the company’s hardware-based revenues in 2021E. We anticipate a long-term decline in hardware revenue contribution given management’s focused transition towards software/services/recurring.Source: Trimble, Inc. and Grinder Capital estimates - $ in millionsNew OEM opportunities within construction and agriculture, as noted on the company’s first-quarter earnings call, provide an expanding foundation for future global OEM growth outside of the traditional China OEM hardware markets served by the company’s electronics and embedded products. Some of the underlying momentum in these OEM opportunities have likely been overshadowed by the prolonged slowdown of OEM contribution from the Asia-Pacific region over the last two years. Reported second-quarter 2019 revenues within the Asia-Pacific region for Building and Infrastructure increased ~$5m, versus the second-quarter of 2017. While not stellar growth, it still implies ~12.5% growth over the last two years from the Asia-Pacific region. While this is not enough to offset declines in other segments such as Geospatial and Transportation, we see it as a positive long-term trend. Our estimates suggest the opportunities in Asia-Pacific may not see a “V” shaped recovery, but the region should stabilize in coming quarters, with potential for expansion as we believe prior headwinds in the region could shift towards tailwinds. We don’t anticipate the company overtakes prior 2017 quarterly revenue run rate in the Asia-Pacific region until sometime in 2021. Thus, we see the Asia-Pacific region stabilizing in the next few years versus delivering an immediate snap-back of revenue growth.Entering the second-half of 2019, the company is overlapping weaker year-over-year comparables, which we believe the company’s reported results, began in the third-quarter of 2018. In addition to improving comps, with China revenues at a mere ~2% of total, we believe there is significantly less downside today than exiting 2017, and more than likely some potential for future upside. While headwinds for Trimble in the Asia-Pacific region accelerated with the initiation of U.S.-China trade dispute in mid-2018, we believe the company will soon begin overlapping the negative impact beginning in the third-quarter of 2019. We believe this will provide an easier year-over-year growth comparable, as we anticipate the downward trend in the company’s Asia-Pacific revenues will likely bottom sometime in the second half, and for the full year 2019.We predict China will remain a long-term growth opportunity for Trimble, however perhaps somewhat smaller than prior expectations, given the hiccup in growth during the initiation of the U.S.-China trade dispute and shifts in China policy which may, or may not, reverse following any trade resolution. Global OEM opportunities have expanded recently in key markets such as agriculture and construction per the company. According to Trimble management during the company’s second-quarter earnings call, global OEM prospects are seeing a strong trajectory. We forecast this trajectory will contribute to future revenue growth globally, and within the Asia-Pacific region. Given our current estimates that 2019 may be the bottom in Asia-Pacific region revenues, since 2017, as we see the prior two-year headwinds beginning to turn towards tailwinds in 2020 and beyond.In prior years, and through the second-quarter of 2018, Trimble’s hardware revenues equaled the vast majority of company revenues. However, beginning in the third-quarter of 2018, the company’s combined software/services/recurring revenue contribution surpassed hardware contribution and has continued to expand in subsequent quarters, compromising most of today’s revenues. For comparison, in 2017, hardware revenues equaled ~52% of total revenues, but by the second-quarter of 2019, this number equaled ~45%. We currently model zero hardware growth from the reported $1,375m in 2017, which we estimate will be the company’s hardware-based revenues in 2021E. We anticipate a long-term decline in hardware revenue contribution given management’s focused transition towards software/services/recurring.Source: Trimble, Inc. and Grinder Capital estimates - $ in millionsThe decline in hardware-based revenues in the last two years has been offset by a transition across all segments towards more stable, higher-margin, software/services/recurring revenues. In 2017, this group of revenues comprised ~48% of total revenues, but today, as of the second-quarter 2019, it has climbed to ~55% of total revenues, or on a TTM basis as of the second-quarter 2019 at 53%. Software/services revenues breakdown between perpetual, and term licenses, combined with professional services. Recurring revenues are comprised of subscriptions (SAAS) and maintenance revenues. Over time, the company plans to convert more of the software business into recurring. At the Berenberg Design Software Conference, in March 2019, Trimble management noted that they expect ~$30m of software business will convert to recurring in 2019.Source: Trimble, Inc.During the company’s 2018 Investor Day, management laid out a goal, stating software/services/recurring revenues would equal ~55% of total company revenue by 2021. Based on data through the second-quarter of 2019, the company is executing on management’s goal and will likely exceed this target by year-end 2019, on a TTM basis, based on our estimates. We believe future growth in software/services/recurring revenues is supported by a growing deferred revenue base, which equaled ~$277m in 3Q17, versus ~$452m as of the second-quarter of 2019. On a year-over-year basis, reported deferred revenue was up 27% during the quarter.The transition towards a higher contribution of revenue from software/services/recurring has also had an initial positive impact on the company’s margin profile. In 2017, non-GAAP gross margin equaled 55.7%. As of the second-quarter 2019, the company reported non-GAAP gross margin of 56.9%, demonstrating the ability for the company to expand its margin profile, on a two-year basis, even with headwinds impacting the company’s Asia-Pacific and North American Agriculture segments. We note that the company reported first-quarter non-GAAP GM of 58%, which we don’t anticipate the company may achieve in future periods but see 2019 as the low in gross margin percentage of revenues since 2017. However, if the company did reach prior reported 2018 non-GAAP gross margin levels ~58%, which would equal a 1% increase in our 2020E/2021E non-GAAP gross margin estimate, it could increase the company’s annual non-GAAP EPS by ~4.6% in both years.Source: Trimble, Inc. and Grinder Capital estimates - $ in millionsUnfortunately, due to higher levels of OPEX spending, in 2017 and 2018, we have not yet seen non-GAAP EBITDA margins benefit from the shift in the company’s revenue mix. We believe over time, this transition, along with a slower spending profile (as a percentage of revenues), will create leverage in the model. We see the opportunity for margin expansion, due to the shift in the company’s estimated future revenue mix, as a catalyst for a higher multiple and valuation.As of 2018, Trimble end-market customers have already begun transitioning away from hardware-based products. In several key end-markets, such as Buildings & Infrastructure, along with Transportation, the company has already seen a material shift, with software/services/recurring already representing >50% of revenues. At the company’s 2018 Investor Day, management noted that Resources & Utilities captured >40% of its end-market revenues from software/services/recurring. We believe this figure is now likely close to, or already has surpassed, the 50% contribution level, in 2019. On the company’s second-quarter earnings call, management noted that it does not see Trimble as a 90% software company at any point in the future. It could, however, become a business with a “6” in front of it in terms of total revenue contribution in future years.Source: Trimble, Inc.Thus, we believe that in key markets like Buildings & Infrastructure/Transportation, based on management commentary, may see software/services/recurring reach ~60-65% of end-market revenues, with some opportunity to transition software/services-based revenues towards recurring. We see a similar growth trajectory for the company in Resources & Utilities, where there is still an opportunity to convert hardware-based revenues to software/services/recurring, but then also transition some of the current, or future, software/service-based revenues into recurring, creating a catalyst for stable, higher-margin revenues. In Geospatial, where a significant portion of revenues remains hardware-based, we see some opportunity for conversion to software/services/recurring but see this segment as likely remaining primarily hardware-based revenues in future years.The transition towards software/services/recurring from hardware-based revenues has been choppy in the last few quarters, driven by an accelerating decline in the company’s Geospatial segment revenues. This decline has been amplified in the Asia-Pacific region, as China-based customers began to favor in-house, or domestic designed, boards and electronics due to global trade tensions. This created a slowdown in revenue growth, during a period of higher spending as a percentage of revenues, in late 2017 and through 2018. In total we still see ~10-15% of today’s hardware-based revenues converting into software/services/recurring revenues. This transition, to higher-margin solutions, with lower forecasted levels of spending as a percentage of revenues, vs. 2017 and 2018, creates the potential for a company able to deliver consistent high single to low double-digit percentage annual revenue growth, with much higher levels of visibility into future revenue streams than provided in the company’s hardware-based revenue model.Source: Trimble, Inc.Source: Trimble, Inc.Given the company will likely achieve 2021 targets for contribution from non-hardware-based revenues, by the end of 2019, we see the company’s forecasts for future transition towards software/services/recurring revenue, and thus margin expansion, as a likely outcome. We see the opportunity for Trimble to transform into a company with an operating model focused on recurring revenue opportunities, a higher-margin profile, and lower contribution from hardware-based revenues, driving the company’s earnings power in coming years. We see our view as very similar to the view presented by Trimble management at the company’s 2018 Investor Day. The projected transition towards software/services/recurring revenues provides investors a catalyst for investment.Even with the company’s long operating history, Trimble remains underpenetrated in several key end-markets, as it shifts the model towards software/services/recurring revenues. Per Trimble, its TAM (Total Addressable Market) equals ~$50B, which is the total of all end-markets served by Trimble products. As of 2018, the company has penetrated ~6% of the projected addressable markets. This suggests to us, that Trimble could potentially capture an additional 5-15% penetration in end-markets over the coming years, bringing its potential penetration to ~11-21%, which would suggest future year revenue potential of ~$5.5-$10.5B. This compares to the ~$3.3B consensus revenue estimate for 2019.The only market where the company has captured 50% or greater penetration, is within Geospatial, which we see as a declining contribution business in future years. All other key end-markets vary in penetration from >25-33%. If each end-market added ~5% in additional penetration in coming years, it would still mean all key end-markets, ex-Geospatial, remain under ~40% penetration. Geospatial currently accounts for ~10% of the company’s estimated addressable market size. With ~90% of total addressable markets likely able to expand penetration in coming years, we believe that this provides an additional investment catalyst for shares of Trimble, Inc.With an estimated multi-year targeted growth rate of ~9-12%, which includes contribution from acquisitions, we believe the company could exceed the low end of our estimated addressable market penetration in 2025, assuming it can grow revenues ~10% per year from our 2021 estimated levels ($3.86B).While multiple catalysts exist for Trimble in the coming years, we see the under penetration of ~90% of total end-market TAM contribution, as a meaningful growth driver. Assuming the mid-point of our estimated additional end-market penetration for Trimble in key markets, ex-Geospatial implies potential revenues of ~$8B. If the company achieved this mid-range estimated penetration in roughly the next nine years, it would imply a potential 10yr revenue CAGR (’18-‘28E) of ~10%, which would be near the low-end of the company’s current estimated total potential growth rate. With potential for sustained organic and total revenue growth, forecasted by management in the coming years, coupled with estimated increasing levels of penetration in ~90% of its addressable markets, suggests to us Trimble may be much closer to a bottom than top at current levels, given its future opportunities.Source: Trimble, Inc.The Sentieo Management-Analyst Sentiment Index seeks to track the trend in sentiment between company management, and the analysts covering the company.

While shares have appreciated YTD, they have underperformed versus the Total S&P 500 Index by >6%. We see multiple catalysts in front of the company likely changing this underperformance during 2020-2021. With shares down ~20% from recent 52-week highs ($46.25) we see the current valuation of future opportunities as mispriced. We anticipate steady revenue growth of ~9-10% in coming years, with expanding non-GAAP EBITDA margins, and non-GAAP EPS growth which outpaces revenue, due to operating leverage as the company shifts towards software/services/recurring revenues. Based on current consensus estimates for 2019, non-GAAP EPS ~$1.94, shares are currently trading at a premium to comparable companies NTM (next twelve months) P/E by ~5.5%. However, by 2020, using consensus estimates of ~$2.16, the NTM P/E multiple is forecasted to be below comparable companies (see Appendix for comparable companies).Source: Trimble, Inc. and Sentieo DataGiven Trimble’s under penetration of ~90% of addressable markets, increasing revenue visibility due to shift towards software/services/recurring revenues, estimated non-GAAP EBITDA margin expansion, and projected 5yr (’16-‘21E) consensus revenue growth of 58%, well above comparable median of 40%, we believe shares of Trimble can trade at a meaningful premium to comps by 2021.Source: Trimble, Inc. and Grinder Capital estimatesUtilizing our current 2021E non-GAAP EPS figure of $2.75, applying a 20x NTM P/E multiple, which would be a ~11% premium to current comparable companies at ~18x, we see shares of Trimble potentially trading into the mid-50s range in the coming years, which would imply possible upside potential of ~45-50% from recent share price of $37.00.Source: Sentieo Data and Grinder Capital estimatesOur thesis related to Trimble, Inc. is straight forward. The company has been negatively impacted the past year by declining contribution in its Geospatial segment, which the company has already penetrated by ~50% and derives the majority of revenue from hardware-based products. This decline has taken China contribution to ~2%, or ~$1.8m, as of the second-quarter 2019, suggesting future downside is likely somewhat contained. The Asia-Pacific region has suffered from recent U.S.-China trade tensions, with impacts beyond just China, but in the second-quarter of 2019, the company noted the ex-China, Asia-Pacific region revenues were up 7%. We believe this prior headwind, related to escalating trade tensions, will soon be lapping easier comparable quarters which saw the impact of trade beginning in the second or third-quarter of 2018.Thus, we see these issues as potentially turning towards tailwinds in 2020 and beyond. Also, we see ~90% of the company’s ~$50B addressable markets as currently underpenetrated, suggesting the potential for higher levels of growth driven by market penetration gains. With a more disciplined spending pattern in future years, based on a percentage of revenues, we believe higher levels of estimated revenue increases can flow through to the company’s non-GAAP EBITDA margins. This operating leverage, which we believe is inherent in the company’s model with the shift towards software/services/recurring revenues, should generate non-GAAP EPS growth in coming years which should meaningfully outpace projected revenue growth.Given the decline in shares from recent 52-week highs, we believe shares are attractive at current levels, as we see future opportunities undervalued and potentially mispriced. Assuming a roughly 11% premium to current comparable companies NTM P/E multiple ~18x, which would be 20x NTM P/E multiple for Trimble, one could see a path for shares towards ~$50-$55. This would suggest the potential upside for shares versus current levels could be ~45-50%. We see the risk-reward as favorable at current share prices.Source: Sentieo DataInvestors should utilize our Trimble, Inc. report as a tool in their overall research process.

4103446,102273,2017-08-31T15:11:49-04:00,Trimble's reorganization of business segments around large industries and focus on providing vertically focused solutions is the right move.Focus on revenue from software and services is beginning to pay-off.Trimble is showing healthy organic growth may bode well for its future.,"Beginning in the fiscal year 2017, Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) has reorganized its business segments that would align well with multi-trillion dollar global markets such as transportation, utilities and infrastructure.Exhibit: Trimble Old & New Reporting Segments(Source: Company Filings)The previous reporting segments were aligned along solution areas and products, but by aligning along global industries Trimble gets an opportunity to compare and contrast its segment growth with that of those industries.The new Geospatial business segment used to be part of the Engineering and Construction segment in previous years.Since the great recession, Trimble has been able to bring its business on track and show both revenue and gross margin growth.Exhibit: Trimble Has Successfully Increased Both Revenues & Gross Margins Since the Great Recession(Source: Company Filings, Author Illustration)This reorganization also allows the company to separate out revenues from Geospatial products that serves as a replacement market and has not shown growth. By aligning business segments along industry lines, Trimble may be able to create vertical-focused solutions that address the complete lifecycle needs within each industry. For example, in construction, Trimble aims to provide real-time, connected and complete information environments for design, build, and operational phases of a project. In essence, Trimble has the potential to address a larger total addressable market (NYSE:TAM) and gain recurring revenue stream via Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) offering. These changes increase the focus on software and services and that will be an important driver for Trimble.An example of the SaaS offering by Trimble is the Trimble 4D Lite. The 4D Lite is a monitoring application that works with hardware such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (NASDAQ:GNSS) receivers, optical total stations and geotechnical sensors, to provide motion monitoring of buildings and structures, dams, bridges, pipelines, transmission structures, and storage facilities. The 4D lite application allows of periodic monitoring of any data time series from user defined sensors. It also allows for advanced visualization and analysis. On the Trimble website, a one-year standard and enterprise subscription (list price) is offered for $1,200 and $3,600 respectively.Exhibit: Trimble 4D Lite Infrastructure Monitoring Software is a SaaS Application(Source: Company Website)In the agriculture business, Trimble has similar SaaS solutions that gathers and analyzes precision farming data, field record and boundaries.Exhibit: Trimble Agriculture Business Solutions offered as a combination of SaaS, Mobile and Desktop Software(Source: Company Website)Trimble is in the beginning stages of this transition to SaaS applications and has more growth to come. Since most of the SaaS revenue is booked under deferred revenue, it leads to a more predictable revenue stream.Exhibit: Trimble Current Deferred Revenue Is Over 10% of Total Annual Revenue(Source: Company Filings, Author Calculations & Illustration)Note: Current & non-current deferred revenues are reported under liabilities in the balance sheets. Current deferred revenue would be found under current liabilities.The adoption and software and technology is historically low in industries such as agriculture, construction and transportation and so it would take a while to convince end-users to pay a regular subscription fees for software. But, once they see the value of such solutions, Trimble should see further increase in both current and non current deferred revenues reflecting the wide adoption of their software and solutions. Ultimately, end-users in construction, transportation, and agriculture should see Trimble’s tools as indispensable to their daily work. That's the only way for Trimble to successfully increase software revenues. As of the fiscal year 2016, non-current deferred revenue is less but growing fast.Exhibit: Trimble Non-current Deferred Revenue Showing Healthy Growth(Source: Company Filings, Author Illustration)In the second quarter of 2017, Trimble showed 9% organic growth in revenues. They were able to show this growth without a recovery in the agriculture and oil prices. This organic growth is key to increasing their base of subscribers to their various software and SaaS services. As more customers join, their revenue would be less susceptible to the vagaries of the end markets that they serve.Trimble’s focus on vertically integrated solutions, its focus on organic growth, and its growing revenue from software and SaaS services bodes well for the company in the long run."

Factors that might hinder the growth are local, such as the sheer size of the country, the different regional conditions and specific national rules and regulations, especially those that are tax-related.Stratas Advisors believes the Brazilian light vehicle fleet will top 43 million in number by 2027. Furthermore, gasoline demand will increase by 1% annually despite efforts to diversify toward low emissions or electric vehicles.Part of the demand for fleet telematics is to reduce operating costs through route management and driver journey control.Automotive Fleet magazine says that an important challenge for fleet operators is that many of their vehicles are spread out over large geographic areas, especially in the southern part of the country.For telematics firms such as Veltec, demand from large- and medium-sized fleet operators is strong as the Brazilian economy continues its slow economic improvement.Trimble didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance, so the deal was likely for a financially non-material amount.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that Trimble had $571 million in cash and equivalents and $2.3 billion in total liabilities, as of June 30, 2018.Free cash flow during the six months ended June 30, 2018, was $231.8 million.TRMB acquired Veltec to gain access to the Brazilian fleet management market.As Thomas Fansler, president of Trimble Transportation Mobility stated in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, TRMB’s stock price has dropped 2.4% vs. the S&P 500 Index 8.1% gain, as the chart below indicates:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)Trimble has been quite actively acquiring technologies over the past several years.Within the fleet management space, I wrote about its acquisitions of 10-4 Systems and ISE.These acquisitions show management’s focus on either adding complementary technologies or, in the case of Veltec, adding geographic footprint as the firm seeks growth overseas.The Brazilian economy has undergone a difficult last few years but appears to be resuming at least slow growth. As the largest country in Latin America, Brazil provides an enticing market for TRMB to devote financial resources to building a business.It may be an opportune time for TRMB to expand its operational base in the country.Management needs to continue building on its telematics capabilities and footprint if the stock is ever to resume its previous growth trajectory."

Trimble did not provide any forward guidance change, nor did it file an 8-K which would have been required if there was a material change to its financial condition.As a result, the transaction was likely for a non-material amount to TRMB’s $9 billion market capitalization.Trimble already provides a range of geospatial asset management and operations to energy distribution utilities.The deal brings NM Group’s flagship ‘Caydence’ 3D visualization solution into Trimble’s existing field data collection and analytics solutions.As Trimble Energy’s Kai Lehtinen stated,So, as a result of the acquisition, Trimble will be able to provide an ‘enriched’ solution set for its client base focused on improved asset management and operations processes.NM Group will become part of Trimble’s Resources and Utilities Segment within its Energy Division.Trimble has been quite actively acquiring technologies across a range of its business segments, as the use of geospatial data has increased dramatically among middle market and large enterprises.Since September 2014, TRMB has acquired twelve companies in a bid to bolster its offerings. The deals have all been technology-focused, non-transformational acquisitions.I expect to see further acquisitions of this type as management finds opportunities to more quickly buy technology enhancements vs. trying to build them.In the past twelve months, the stock has risen from $25.58 to nearly $36.00, so it appears the overall market likes what it has been seeing.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

The use of its systems enables operators to receive automatic alarms for any train and track systems that are out of tolerance, resulting in 'reductions in maintenance costs and increased fleet availability for revenue generation purposes.'Acquisition Terms, Rationale and CommentaryNeither company disclosed the financial terms of the deal. However, in a recent earnings call, Trimble management stated that Beena's annual revenue was 'around 1% of Trimble revenue', or around $23 million.Beena Vision is 'profitable' according to Trimble CEO Steven Berglund, but I can't imagine Trimble paid more than 2x sales for such a small firm, so it is likely Trimble paid under $50 million for the deal.The rationale for the acquisition of Beena is to expand Trimble's rail portfolio of services.Trimble management said that Beena's focus on freight rail would be complementary to Trimble's focus on passenger rail.In addition, there will be geographic complementarity, with Beena's North America and Australian market penetration in contrast to Trimble's U.K. and Europe penetration.Furthermore, Beena's vision-based data collection technology will be integrated with Trimble's rolling stock asset management solutions. This will enable customers to improve operational efficiencies because they will now have a fully integrated and more complete picture of their rolling stock in real time.Beena will report as part of Trimble's Engineering & Construction segment. The deal appears to have a positive technological impact on Trimble's offerings while being slightly accretive to earnings after one quarter of purchase-related expenses.Additionally, the two companies have little apparent geographical overlap, so the acquisition is also complementary as Trimble seeks to broaden its railroad operations offerings globally.Assuming prompt integration, I expect to see positive results in Trimble's Railway Solutions division within the next four to six quarters.I write about IPOs, M&A, follow-ons and secondaries.

4077478,21798,2017-05-30T15:32:56-04:00,Trimble’s robotics-related and other products will drive strong growth for the company.I expect growth for each of the company’s segments.Trimble’s valuation is reasonable to allow the stock to make further above-average gains.,"One area of technology that I find intriguing for investing purposes is robotics. Robotics can be controversial as some consider the technology as a threat to jobs. However, technologies have always advanced over time. If technology never advanced, we would still be riding around on horses, hunting, and gathering for all of our meals. Ultimately, robotics will increase productivity and make our lives better and safer just as more advanced technology has already improved our standard of living over past generations.Trimble (TRMB) is a robotics-related company that I think will perform well as an investment over the long-term. Trimble is more of a behind-the-scenes industrial-related company as opposed to a consumer-related robotics company like iRobot (IRBT).Trimble has a wide array of products that span across numerous industries. This gives Trimble diversification and protection in the event that one industry experiences a downturn. My thesis is that Trimble's above average earnings growth will drive above average stock returns over the long-term.Applications and Industries ServedRobotics is just one of aspect of Trimble's numerous applications. Trimble's robotics are used for numerous tasks on land and in water. Trimble's robotics-related products are some of the key components that help robots operate with accuracy and precision.Trimble's robotics-related products include: small GNS receiver modules that are ideal for precision and control modules, small dual-frequency OEM global navigation satellite system [GNSS] receiver boards for precision/control applications, single-board solutions for precise position and heading, receiver boards with improved positioning engines with additional GNSS signals, and networked transceivers that support wireless communications with a range as high as 70 miles in low noise environments.Trimble's technology allows robotics to perform tasks for practical purposes and for tasks that are too dangerous for humans to perform. Trimble's robotics products are likely to be in increased demand as companies look to boost productivity and to reduce the risk of serious injuries by having robots instead of humans perform risky tasks.The global robotics industry is projected to grow from $34.1 billion in 2016 to over $226 billion by 2021. This represents a compound annual growth rate [CAGR] of 46%. Trimble is set to benefit from this growth as the company's products are increasingly used for various applications.Trimble's list of industries and applications is extensive. This link displays all of them, so I won't mention each one in the article. Here are some of the applications: 3-D laser scanning, aerial sensor systems, agriculture, automotive embedded systems, building design construction/engineering, energy, environmental, field service management, RFID, military/defense, mining, oil/gas, surveying/mapping, transportation/logistics, and water/waste water management.You can see that Trimble's extensive amount of applications gives the company diversification among multiple sources of revenue and industries. This will help reduce the negative impact of down markets in a specific industry.Segment StrengthTrimble achieved gains in 3 out of 4 segments for Q1 2017. The Geospatial segment experienced a 2% revenue decline only because of the divestitures of ThingMagic, Advanced Public Safety, and Gatewing. If the effect of divestitures was excluded, the Geospatial segment would have posted a gain.I think the Geospatial segment is set for future growth. Trimble's SX10 product, the scanning total station, is likely to drive growth for this segment. The SX10 is used for surveying, imaging, and high-speed 3D scanning. This product is considered a step ahead of the competition as it is more efficient than other equipment without requiring a learning curve. Users can obtain the information that they need in less time with the SX10. I expect the SX10 to drive growth in this segment as Trimble ramped up manufacturing in response to a strong backlog.The Building and Infrastructure segment achieved an 8% revenue gain. The gains in this segment were primarily attributed to strong performance of building software, architecture, design products, and BIM software.I expect the Building/Infrastructure segment to achieve steady gains going forward. This is based on expected global infrastructure spending growth to reach about 5% per year by 2020. This would be significantly higher than the 2% growth from 2016. The growth is likely to keep demand growing for Trimble's construction and civil engineering products.The Resources & Utilities segment increased 5% mostly as a result of strong performance in agriculture and correction services. Europe, Russia, and Brazil drove most of the agriculture growth, with slight growth coming from North America.Trimble made a deal with Valley Irrigation, a division of Valmont Industries (VMI), in Q1. The deal makes Valley Irrigation the exclusive OEM distributor of Trimble's Irrigate-IQ precision irrigation solution. The combined technology will give farmers access to a high-accuracy irrigation system.Ultimately, Trimble's agricultural products are likely to grow as farmers look to increase productivity by boosting output and reducing costs in the face of volatile weather.The Transportation segment experienced the most growth with a 9% gain. The growth in this segment was driven by North America, the Electronic Logging Device government mandate, and complementary sales such as video cameras.Operators of transportation-related companies are likely to continue to seek out solutions to increase productivity to drive higher profitability. That should keep demand growing for Trimble's fleet management solutions and related products.Image source: Movie - Office Space; Meme created by author using memedad.comValuationTrimble is trading at 22X expected earnings per share for 2018 of $1.60. The stock is trading at a premium to the S&P 500's forward PE of 19.7 and to competitor, Hexagon AB (OTCPK:HXGBY) which also trades with a forward PE of 19.7. However, I think Trimble's valuation is justified as a result of the company's strong double-digit expected earnings growth.Trimble is expected to grow earnings at 17% to 18% in 2017 and 14% in 2018. Trimble is expected to average earnings growth of 15% to 16% annually for this year and next year. This is higher than Hexagon's expected average annual growth of 12% to 13% for this year and next year. So, I think Trimble's stock is valued reasonably given the strong expected earnings growth.ConclusionTrimble's technology is likely to see continued demand growth as companies are always looking to increase productivity and reduce costs. Trimble has multiple solutions to address these companies' needs.I expected Trimble's double-digit earnings growth to drive the stock to outperform the S&P 500 through 2018. Although the forward valuation is trading at a slight premium to the S&P 500 and competitor, Hexagon, I expect Trimble's stock to increase about 15% annually in 2017 and 2018, driven by earnings growth. The stock is likely to experience tailwinds from being associated with robotics. Robotics-related stocks have been performing well, given their promising growth outlook.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Revenue will improve inclusive of high-margin and predictable recurring revenue. Gross margin improvement will follow.Trimble's share price hit a 52-week high on August 8th representing a multiple of 20 on 2017 earnings estimate. Potential investors should now wait on market pullbacks.","SourceTrimble Navigation (NASDAQ:TRMB) has three initiatives identified for improvement in 2016. From a business perspective, the three targets are banally basic -- grow revenue, reduce costs, improve gross margin. When Trimble reported second quarter results on August 2nd, the positioning, connecting, modeling and analysis solutions provider had outperformed on but one of the three measures compared to the same quarter in the prior year.Revenue for the quarter totaled $609.6 million, improving 4% over 2015. As revenue increases, the cost of goods sold naturally increases. Therefore, the gross margin measure reflects true improvement. Gross margin for the second quarter declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 51.8%. Trimble reports revenue in three lines -- product, service and subscription. In just one of the three lines, gross margin increased year-over-year.Source: Author-created from company dataAs shown, gross margins for both service and subscription yield more gross profit. Trimble's software offerings play a key role in service and subscription revenue. Its software can be sold as a perpetual license with maintenance support and installed on the customer's premise. Alternatively, Trimble offers hosted software or SaaS (software as a service).The service and subscription lines generate recurring revenue for Trimble. Recurring revenue includes subscription, maintenance and support revenue. Increasing recurring revenue is a key evolutionary step in Trimble's transformation from a ""box product"" manufacturer to a solutions provider. Trimble solutions marry hardware, sensors, software, connectivity and data.Recurring revenue equates to visibility and predictability of future revenue streams. In the 2016 second quarter, recurring revenue represented 27% of the total for the trailing twelve months. This percentage did not represent improvement compared to the 2016 first quarter results. However, as the total revenue for the trailing twelve months increases, the total recurring revenue does as well regardless of the lack of improvement in the ratio. Therefore, sequentially, recurring revenue has improved from approximately $595 million at year-end 2015 to approximately $618 million for the 2016 first quarter to almost $625 million for the 2016 second quarter. By the end of the year, recurring revenue should increase at a double-digit clip compared to year-end 2015.Source: Author-created from company data and author analysisThere is a theoretical downside to a recurring revenue model. With an upfront payment, Trimble recognizes the revenue over the contracted time rather than all at once. The unrecognized revenue is recorded in deferred revenue. In the 2016 second quarter, deferred revenue totaled $315.2 million.Although Trimble's results in the second quarter may appear questionable relative to its focus, it is pertinent to recall the company targeted the second half of 2016 for marked improvement. In the first quarter earnings call, the company was adamant.Their insistence did not waiver.On the revenue front, Trimble expects second half improvement in all operating segments. The Mobile Solutions segment logged a record level of backlog.Source: Author-created from company data and author analysisRevenue growth is but one step to overall improvement. Gross margin improvement is also in sight.Increased revenue and improving gross margins will deliver a higher gross profit. In 2015, Trimble's restructuring efforts delivered a $30 million annual decrease in operating expenses. Divestitures of weaker business lines in 2016 should drive the annual savings to $40 million in time. Trimble projects its operating margin could reach 19% by year-end compared to the 16.2% in the second quarter.Further impacting the bottom line is the share repurchase activity. In the second quarter, Trimble repurchased $80 million of its outstanding shares. Year-to-date, the total is $92 million. The company still has $158 million available on its current authorization.Trimble's share price has improved nearly 30% year-to-date. After the company's optimistic second quarter results, the share price climbed to a new 52-week high of $28.00 on August 8th. Using analysts' average EPS estimate for 2017 of $1.40, the forward year multiple equates to 20. Interested investors will want to take advantage of overall market pullbacks for an entry point."
3756756,56112,2015-12-16T11:26:45-05:00,"Trimble has had every headwind in the book thrown at it, yet has still pretty much held the line on revenue and generated solid operating cash flow.Agriculture and overseas economic malaise will both continue to be significant headwinds and prevent Trimble from achieving double-digit growth in 2016.Despite the significant decline, the valuation still seems to bake in long-term expectations of double-digit growth, so I'm not in a hurry to build a position at this price.","To say the past 24 months have been unkind to Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) would be putting it mildly. In no particular order, the company has faced headwinds from FX translation, profound macro weakness in agriculture, oil prices that have been cut in half (and are still falling), and anemic economies overseas that make America's sluggish GDP growth look good by comparison. That said, Trimble seems to have turned the corner in Q3. While there are still major headwinds - and the company's guidance for single-digit revenue growth in 2016 is well below the double-digit historical average - there are definitely rays of sunshine peeking out from behind the clouds. The valuation bakes a lot of this in, though, so I'm not sure investors need to be in a hurry to build a position.Still Fighting Cyclicality, But Maybe We're Past The Worst?Trimble's solutions are focused on capital-intensive industries that often lag behind in technology adoption - farming and construction, for example. This provides Trimble with strong secular growth potential. Typically, the company is less cyclical than these end-markets because they sell productivity rather than capacity; their products (both hardware and software) are sold on an ROI basis. Right now, though, things are falling too far, too fast for Trimble to maintain the mid-teens revenue growth it has historically enjoyed.Trimble's Q3 came in at the high end of revenue guidance, and non-GAAP operating margin of 18.7% was higher than the previous three quarters, putting the company back on track to achieve targeted 20% margins during 2016. I could go over the revenue breakdown line by line, but I'm not sure there's much point because it's pretty much what you'd expect.Looking forward to 2016, the company is cautious about the impacts of continued weakness in both oil and gas and agriculture. The former does not seem horribly concerning; Trimble only ever saw about 1% of revenue directly from oil exploration; the bigger impact has been the follow-on effect of an abrupt slowdown in construction activity in oil-patch boomtowns like Midland and Williston.On the broader construction side, recent commentary from equipment-rental companies Neff Rental (NYSE:NEFF) and H&E Equipment Services (NASDAQ:HEES), which I've written up here and here, suggest that activity has stabilized in branches with heavy oil and gas exposure - although it's worth noting that this was before the further leg down in oil prices that's occurred over the past few days. Non-residential construction demand in the US remains robust, and industry executives seem to think the recent passage of a highway bill is a major positive, both for heavy civil project letting and just generally for industry confidence (which is likely needed to convince reluctant managers to change their workflow rather than just rely on old, inefficient methods).While the US is a bright spot, Trimble derives half of its revenue overseas, and isn't quite as optimistic about the outlook for its Heavy Civil business in markets like Australia or China. More broadly, the company's fastest growing markets over the past ten years have been emerging markets, so the weakness there (with Brazil leading, or should I say lagging, the pack) has weighed on the company's results and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.The biggest outstanding question is agriculture, which is a woeful place to be at the moment. For some context, absent some sort of miracle in the last few weeks of the year, the USDA estimates that 2015 farm income in the United States will come in at $55.9 billion. That's down 38% from 2014 - which itself was down nearly 27% from recent highs in 2013. 2015 numbers would represent the lowest farm income since 2002, on both a real and nominal basis.Source: USDAAs a result, ag-equipment OEMs such as Deere (NYSE:DE) are projecting a continued decline in sales into 2016. Trimble's assessment seems pretty conservative - as CEO Steven Berglund explained on the call:There is some good news on this front: by virtue of the significant drop in ag over the past few years and growth in other areas, Trimble's results are no longer driven quite as much by agriculture. In its 2014 annual report, the company noted that its Field Solutions segment contributed only 29% of non-GAAP operating income in 2014 vs. 47% two years prior; the rest of the company grew 60%, offsetting some of the agriculture-driven weakness. Given ag's tough year, it's an even smaller part of the business now.All in all, Trimble is looking at single digit revenue growth in 2016 - which is substantially better than its end markets. Any growth at all is encouraging directionally, but it's still well below the historical revenue growth - or the future revenue growth rate that would be required to justify the company's strong valuation (which we'll get to momentarily). Analysts have been asking questions, wondering aloud whether some of the company's historical revenue growth was at least in part due to favorable end-markets. CEO Steven Berglund disputed that premise at a recent investor conference, stating that he believed the company was still a double-digit organic grower, and looking out three years, the company is still looking to achieve that.Long-Term Potential Solid… But How Much Is Priced In?Looking beyond near-term headwinds, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about Trimble's business. They're making good progress on driving subscription and services revenue - which is now above a $1B annual run rate - and the value proposition for the company's offerings remains strong. Keying in on construction, for example, the company believes that its suite of solutions (from 3D BIM to GPS-based grade control systems) can reduce the costs of projects by 25-30%. (The company's marketing site provides a pretty good overview.)I've been to several construction conferences and have chatted with many executives in the industry. Let's just say that offerings like Trimble's are sorely needed. For those interested in understanding the issue at a deeper level, this July 2015 report from McKinsey on construction productivity is excellent. To summarize, 98% of projects incur cost overruns or delays, and perhaps the following chart says it all:Source: McKinseyThe company's integrated Design-Build-Operate construction offering is validated by a contract with AECOM. It has similarly attractive value propositions for farms and transportation fleets, and adoption of its technology is still in early days. Cyclical headwinds won't be around forever, and there's really no reason to believe the company won't be able to return to double-digit revenue growth in the future.The problem is that a lot of that is already priced into the stock. Despite multiple years of weakness - first a decline, then substantially below-target growth - Trimble still trades at a healthy 2.7x revenue. This kind of performance is usually a death knell for growth stock valuations. On a forward earnings basis, if you give the company credit for getting back to 20% non-GAAP operating margins and mid-single digit revenue growth, the enterprise value is over 12.5x forward non-GAAP EBIT.This is obviously a multiple, which implies more than mid-single digit revenue growth over the long term. It's why I would have pause jumping in just yet - while the company seems to have made every attempt to be conservative in projecting 2016, the fact remains that some of its drivers, particularly ag and emerging markets, could get worse before they get better. It seems unlikely that the market would take another bad year that well, and it also seems unlikely that Trimble is going to blow the roof off in the next few quarters.For those who are less familiar with the story, note that most of the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is amortization from the multitude of tuck-in acquisitions the company has done over the years, as well as some stock based comp. Since operating cash flow has tracked pretty well to non-GAAP net income over the years, I feel okay using it for valuation purposes (although I do model in the dilution).Source: Trimble investor presentationFor what it's worth, Trimble management repurchased $228 million worth of common stock YTD in 2015, and has a remaining authorization of $250 million, which they intend to use ""opportunistically.""Never Let A Crisis Go To WasteWhen Trimble eventually emerges from this tough period - whether that's in 2017 or beyond - the company will be even stronger, as it is doing its best to work on the cost structure in the meanwhile. Operating leverage has always been close to religion at Trimble, and incremental revenue contributes about 25% operating margin right now. I believe this could potentially go higher in the long term as the mix continues to shift towards recurring subscription software.Hopefully adding to that, the company is focused on eliminating some inefficiencies that have grown due to the company's plethora of tuck-in acquisitions over the years. Specifically, the company is eliminating unnecessary legal entities and consolidating sales organizations as well as production platforms. The company is increasingly focused on its Trimble Platform as a Service - TPaaS - creating a common user experience across all markets and applications, while allowing Trimble's developers to reuse modules (and thus save time and money).The company didn't specify exactly how much it expects these endeavors to save in total, but back of the envelope based on other companies I follow that have gone through similar endeavors, SG&A could probably be reduced by at least a point, if not two. Supporting multiple acquired technology platforms has not only direct financial costs, but also indirect costs insofar as reduced organizational efficiency. Freeing up tech resources to work on developing, rather than maintaining, might accelerate the cadence of new product releases without materially increasing R&D costs (which the company actually expects to come down due to lower duplication).ConclusionTrimble is a company I really like, and the current valuation on an EV/revenue basis is the lowest it's been since 2010. I wouldn't fault investors who want to pay up for quality - notwithstanding all the headwinds, Trimble is still generating solid operating cash flow and nothing has structurally changed with the long-term growth thesis. At the same time, however, I think it will be a couple of years before the company can return to mid-teens revenue growth.What I'm concerned about is this: by the time the agriculture market and foreign economies start showing signs of life, what about the US, where Trimble generates half its revenues? A few years out, we'll be almost a decade into the economic expansion, and construction activity will have been robust for several years. Those would not be concerns at a lower stock price, but the valuation would likely compress further if the company does not return to double digit revenue growth in the next few years. For now, then, I'm in wait-and-see mode on Trimble, but it's certainly a business I'd love to own at the right entry point."
3982562,24491,2016-06-16T16:59:46-04:00,"Trimble is best known for its GPS technology, but it offers a wide range of positioning technologies. It generates roughly 55% of its revenue in North America.Trimble's markets are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future, particularly from emerging markets such as China and India.Growing recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue and a record backlog in Trimble's 'Mobile Solutions' segment have management optimistic they will deliver a return to growth in 2016.Let's take a look at the firm's investment highlights as we walk through the valuation process to derive a fair value estimate for shares.","By The Valuentum TeamTrimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) is a market leader in a number of large, growing verticals. The firm's core end markets are characterized by being in the early phases of technology adoption. It continues to work to deepen its wallet share of each of the end markets it serves. For example, the company addresses the entire construction workflow and offers efficiency solutions via machine control and positioning technology, as well as Building Information Management software. Trimble offers similar solutions in the areas of agriculture and transportation and logistics, among others.While Trimble has benefited from strong performance in its 'Building Construction' and 'Transportation and Logistics' segments, the company's geospatial business in the 'E&C' segment has suffered due to the recent collapse in oil prices, as has its 'Agricultural' segment due to weakness in agriculture-related commodity prices. As a result of this pressure, total revenue fell ~4% in fiscal 2015. In addition to the cyclicality of its commodity-driven end markets, the intense competitive nature of its industry provides risk to Trimble's operations. Continual product development will be vital to keep the firm competitive.Moving forward, Trimble plans to grow revenue by continuing to target underserved market segments and accelerating product development. The firm is also is shifting its focus to grow recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue, a strategy we very much like and one that will help mitigate cyclicality in its end markets served. Recurring revenue reached ~27% of total revenue in 2015, for example, up from ~9% in 2014. A record backlog in Trimble's 'Mobile Solutions' segment is also encouraging as management continues to work to return to growth in 2016. We'll be monitoring Trimble's performance relative to management's expectations closely.Trimble's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Trimble is best known for its GPS technology, but it offers a wide range of positioning technologies. The company's Field Solutions segment generates nearly 40% operating margins. It generates roughly 55% of its revenue in North America. The company was founded in 1978 and is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.• Trimble has made over 100 strategic acquisitions since 2000 to augment organic growth. Generally the targets have been in the technology market or an adjacent industry. 80% of these transactions have been less than $25 million, but the firm has a solid track record of execution following said acquisitions.• After a down year in 2015, we're expecting a return to growth for Trimble in 2016. The company is anticipating strong deferred revenue and a record backlog in Mobile Solutions to boost results as it continues to shift its business towards software and recurring revenue. In 2015 software/services/recurring revenue accounted for 47% of total revenue, compared to 32% in 2012.• The company's historical financials are a sight to see. Revenue has advanced steadily to more than $2 billion from roughly $250 million in 1999, while non-GAAP earnings-per-share has leapt significantly from under $0.20 over the same time period. We expect continued top- and bottom-line expansion.• The firm's markets are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future, particularly from emerging markets such as China and India. We think gross margins should be watched closely.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital.The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Trimble's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 39.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.2%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.The concept of an economic moat - or sustainable competitive advantages - focuses purely on the sustainability and the duration of the competitive advantages that a firm possesses. The concept of an economic moat does not consider the cumulative sum of a firm's potential future economic profit creation, but only that at some point in time in the future, a moaty company will continue to have an economic profit spread and a no-moat firm will not.Let's examine the problem that arises by focusing exclusively on companies that have economic moats, or sustainable and durable competitive advantages.Image Source: ValuentumIn the chart below, we show the probable path of Trimble' ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Trimble's free cash flow margin has averaged about 14.4% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Trimble, cash flow from operations decreased about 14% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 38% over the same time period.In the first quarter of 2016, Trimble reported cash from operations of ~$113 million and capital expenditures of ~$5 million, resulting in free cash flow generation of ~$108 million, a 12% increase from the first quarter of 2015.Valuation AnalysisThis is the most important portion of our analysis. Below we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate for shares.We think Trimble is worth $21 per share with a fair value range of $17-$25. Shares are currently trading at ~$26, just above the upper bound of our fair value range. This indicates that we feel there is more downside risk than upside potential associated with shares at the moment.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance.We're expecting a top-line growth rate in the mid-single digits for 2016 and 2017, which is consistent with consensus estimates and similar to management expectations for the near term. We're projecting earnings per share growth to outpace that of revenue growth as the firm targets margin expansion in coming years.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.5% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 3.9%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 17%, which is above Trimble's trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.3% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Trimble, we use a 10.2% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $21 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Trimble. We think the firm is attractive below $17 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $25 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Trimble's fair value at this point in time to be about $21 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Trimble's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $29 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $21 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

3422486,40101,2015-08-11T10:54:29-04:00,"Trimble Navigation reported 2015 second quarter results on August 4th. Benefits from the first quarter's restructuring were not evident. Outside challenges continue to impact its results.Though the company expected ""meaningful improvement"" in the second half of 2015, its expectations are lower now.Until the potential of 2016 is validated, without a turn-around in the areas creating challenges, there's little reason in 2015 driving an investment thesis.","""We simply need to execute.""That was the reason behind Trimble Navigation's (NASDAQ:TRMB) management realignment in the 2015 first quarter. The changes were meant to have immediate impact - a ""hard-knock short-term accountability"". But, even in the 2015 first quarter, Trimble had already started focusing past the 2015 second quarter. Waves of challenge have pounded on the company for several quarters. A downturn in the agricultural industry was then followed by a downturn in the oil and gas industry. The downturns were encompassed by negative impacts from weather and are now clouded by the impact from a strong U.S. dollar. With the second quarter, economic uncertainty in key markets (China and Brazil) challenged the near-term health of the global operator.Trimble Navigation is a provider of positioning, connecting, modeling and analysis (PCMA) technology and solutions. Trimble Navigation management approached the second quarter ""soberly"". The concept of ""incremental growth"" was pushed to 2016. The target for the remainder of 2015 was to ""achieve stability in our base business"". The company reported 2015 second quarter results on August 4th. Revenue decreased year-over-year but increased sequentially from the first quarter. Net income, however, decreased both year-over-year and sequentially. For the first half of 2015, revenue decreased 6.7% compared to 2014. Operating expenses, on the other hand, increased 5.3% in the same time frame. The overall impact for the first six months, unfortunately, was a $76.7 million difference to non-GAAP net income which equated to a deficit of $0.29 in earnings per share. Non-GAAP EPS, year-to-date, are just $0.56 in 2015 compared to $0.84 in 2014. Stability is hardly a suitable descriptor. Rather than rehashing issues and challenges, several aspects of progress that were made are worthy of attention.Trimble Navigation had previously determined revenue derived from SaaS (software as a service) and subscription fees and maintenance support agreements was growing at a faster pace than overall revenue. Even more encouraging in the software realm is the tie between the company's software and its hardware and sensor products. Hardware and sensors are driving recurring revenue through a product category informally tagged hardware-enabled software. Gross margins on recurring revenue are greater than the gross margin on product. Therefore, progress in this area helps build stability and predictability. In the second quarter, subscription revenue grew 16.8% compared to the 2014 second quarter and 5.4% compared to the 2015 first quarter. All sources of recurring revenue contributed approximately 25% of total revenue in the first six months of 2015.Progress is also being made on developing a direct-selling model. Traditionally, Trimble Navigation relied on dealers to sell product. But, more recently, large projects and enterprise customers have needed direct access to Trimble's expertise and professional services. The direct-selling model will be employed in Trimble's construction and agriculture markets. Alongside this effort, Trimble is developing dealer networks in each market capable of supporting the bundling of hardware and software. The recent reorganization is structured to support both direct-selling and dealer enhanced support.Guidance for the third quarter's revenue is a range of $535 million to $560 million. Although the company was reluctant to discuss the fourth quarter yet, Mr. Steven Berglund, CEO, did share the current view for the quarter's revenue will be ""flat to potentially up relative to last year"". Revenue in the 2014 fourth quarter was $568 million. Therefore, at a minimum, 2015 second-half should reach $1,103 million which is less than the first half's production of $1,168 million. Francois Delepine, CFO, explicitly stated:Although Trimble is not projecting second-half revenue for 2015 to fare better than the first half, a specific focus on operating margin improvement is at the center of management's attention. In the first quarter, the company offered this definition of improvement:In the second quarter earnings call, the company offered a four-part approach to return operating margins to a 20% mark:Guidance for the non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter is a range of $0.19 to 0.26. The projection, at its midpoint, represents a 33% decrease year-over-year. If the company can deliver on its plan and begin delivering margin improvements by the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter does have the potential to be greater than the third quarter. Furthermore, the company has $177 million authorized for share repurchases. In the past twelve months, Trimble has actively repurchased $171 million in shares. A decreasing share count will benefit the EPS equation.If Trimble can deliver at least the midpoint of its non-GAAP EPS range in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter, it will earn, minimally, $1.00 in non-GAAP EPS for the full year. Value investors may argue that a challenged company such as Trimble should, therefore, not trade at more than $15. While the company still persists in its longer-term view, there's currently little reason to start a position before the company's 2016 potential is validated. Existing shareholders should have opportunity through the rest of 2015 to average down their position if needed. In the meantime, just as outside forces weigh on the company, outside forces could trigger a rebound. If Trimble is on a watch list, watch for a turn-around in the agriculture industry, a turn-around in the oil and gas industry, stabilizing economic conditions in China, Brazil, Russia, Australia, and Europe, or a shift in exchange rates. Trimble is positioned to be a benefactor of positive changes in the same environments that created its challenges."

2935946,40101,2015-02-21T13:59:57-05:00,"Trimble Navigation reported fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on February 10th. It met its guidance even while the expected challenges from the agricultural industry continued to weigh on the company.Headwinds faced in the fourth quarter will carry over to the first half of 2015 for Trimble.Even with the challenges and headwinds, the market opportunities are broad and deep for the company. The second half of 2015 is setting up for Trimble to resume breaking records.","Trimble Navigation (NASDAQ:TRMB), a leading integrator of global positioning solutions, reported fourth-quarter and full-year earnings for 2014 on February 10th. Unfortunately, the quarter brought more adversity and disappointment to the PCMA (Position, Connect, Model, Analyze) company. Shareholders in Trimble have been watching the company's revenues in its Field Solutions segment since the first quarter of 2014 (revisit the story here). Even though the segment contributed only 21% of the company's total revenue in 2013, it was responsible for 33% of its earnings. The segment serves the agricultural industry. Overall, that market was projected to grow 60% in the four-year period between 2014 and 2018, but two consecutive winter weather glitches triggered a stream of volatility in the segment. By the third quarter of 2014, Trimble management had declared its agricultural market forecast model ""broken"". Thus, the fourth-quarter earnings report was to serve as a barometer of whether Trimble management had a grasp on its prospects in the agricultural market yet.Revenue in the Field Solutions segment in the fourth quarter was $80.7 million, a 27% decrease from 2013's same quarter. For the full year, the segment's revenue fell from $473.9 million to $422 million, an 11% decrease. As mentioned above, the impact to earnings is more severe. Operating income in the segment fell almost 45%.Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $568.3 million. Management had guided revenue in the range of $560 million to $590 million. With the company meeting the low end of its own guidance, there's some assurance that management is more in tune with its markets.The Field Solutions segment is certainly not the whole story at Trimble. Between 2009 and 2013, the company more than doubled revenue and more than tripled net income. Even in 2014, excluding the Field Solutions segment, revenue growth was 9%. But the impact of the Field Solutions segment cannot be ignored. Compared to the same quarter in the previous year, fourth-quarter revenue was down 6% and non-GAAP EPS was down 33%. For the full year, revenue at $2.4 billion was up 5% over 2013's $2.3 billion, but the impact of the Field Solutions segment resulted in a 7.6% decrease in non-GAAP EPS to $1.46 from $1.58.Though shareholders in Trimble specifically monitor the Field Solutions segment, overriding questions in the market also proved to be pertinent for the fourth quarter:Trimble has little direct exposure to the oil and gas industry. Only 1% of its total revenue ties directly to the industry. Yet, of that 1%, a 20% to 25% decline hit in the fourth quarter. Regarding the stronger value of the dollar, the company does operate globally. Its reach to 135+ countries translates to at least 45% of its revenue coming from outside North America. About 33% of its revenue is transacted in non-U.S. currency. Management is now building in allowances for both impacts - decreased oil prices and a strong dollar - for at least the first half of 2015.Likewise, Trimble's difficulties with the downturn in the agricultural industry are projected to continue into 2015:Still, Trimble's long-term view maintains that the agricultural industry offers substantial growth opportunities in technology innovation. In its other operating segments - Construction, Transportation & Logistics, and Geospatial - Trimble believes the positive trends it sees will boost revenue by double-digit rates in the second half of 2015.In the second quarter of 2014, the company set a record for quarterly revenue at $642 million. A fair question would be whether TRMB can return to that level of performance and, if so, when? At the end of 2013, recurring revenue had grown to 22% of total revenue or $503 million. Recurring revenue is growing at three times the rate of overall revenue for Trimble. Recurring revenue is attractive because it provides a solid foundation every quarter to cover operating expenses. Based on the growth in recurring revenue in approximately 7 quarters, recurring revenue alone should reach that same record mark of $642 million. The charts below project reaching a run rate of $642 million per quarter, as well as recurring revenue reaching $642 million.(original chart with data from annual reports and author projections)With all of the allowances Trimble is making for the first half of 2015, guidance for the first quarter was mixed. The revenue projection was $590 million to $620 million. At the midpoint, this is flat compared to the first quarter of 2014. The non-GAAP EPS projection was $0.26 to $0.33. This midpoint is a 25% decrease compared to 2014 first-quarter results. Remembering the second quarter of 2014 set a revenue record, it will not be surprising if the company guides revenue down year over year in the 2015 second quarter. But, Trimble attempted to be clear in its earnings call - it expects the headwinds it faces to impact the first half of 2015 more so than the second half. Year-over-year comparisons for the second half will be easier to top. The chart below projects the quarterly progression. The third quarter of 2015 may be the next quarter to set a new record.(original chart with data from annual reports and author projections)As investors continue to monitor Trimble, they should consider these marks in relation to its recovery from recent impacts:Breaking through these levels would be a bullish indicator for Trimble.The market has factored the challenges TRMB faces into its share price. From a high in March 2014 of $40.17, the price has fallen to a recent low of $23.68. Trimble took advantage of the drop as well. In August 2014, it activated a new $300 million share buyback program. In 2014, the company repurchased over 3 million shares, including over 1 million in the fourth quarter. It spent $97.8 million in the year; $32.8 million in the fourth quarter.Even with the 40+% drop in its share price in 2014, Trimble is trading at what appears to be a fair value with a P/E ratio in a range of 18 to 20. The company's share price probably won't be breaking past its 52-week high in the first half of 2015. For shareholders with a current stake in Trimble, the first half of 2015 may be offering a good point to average down."
3669676,40101,2015-11-10T00:10:00-05:00,"Trimble Navigation reported third quarter results on October 29th. The company beat the high end of its previous guidance for the quarter.With just two months left in 2015, Trimble is turning its sight and hopes toward 2016.In its earnings call, the company highlighted four catalysts of opportunity under its control and one potential catalyst under external control. Potential investors should know what to watch.","There's really nothing unfamiliar on the list of challenges Trimble Navigation (NASDAQ:TRMB) has faced to date in 2015:As early as the first quarter, the company expected little progress in 2015 and was looking toward 2016. Incremental growth was shelved until 2016. Achieving stability was the target for the remainder of 2015. Trimble even realigned its management team for the task.Earnings per share in the first six months of 2015 declined 33% year-over-year to $0.56. Expectations for the second half of the year were reset. The company hoped to be able to impact operating margins in the fourth quarter. The outlook for the remainder of the year was tempered with caution. Earning $1.00 per share became the target.On October 29th, Trimble Navigation, a PCMA (positioning, connecting, modeling and analysis) technology and solutions provider, reported 2015 third quarter results. The company reported revenue of $562.3 million. It surpassed the guidance range of $535 million to $560 million established at the end of the second quarter. For the first nine months, revenue totals $1.73 billion. The company estimated fourth quarter revenue in a range of $520 million and $550 million. At the midpoint, the company will deliver full-year revenue of $2.27 billion, a 5.6% decline from 2014.Earnings per share were expected to decline 33% in the third quarter just as in the first six months. Instead, non-GAAP EPS declined just 10%. Year-to-date, non-GAAP EPS total $0.86. The target of $1.00 per share in earnings is within reach. Trimble estimated fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS should be in a range of $0.19 to $0.26. Therefore, unlike the year-over-year revenue decline of 5.6%, the EPS decline will likely be in a range of 23% to 28%.With less than two months left in 2015, questions naturally turn to whether things will return to a level of normalcy in 2016. In the third quarter earnings call, Trimble's CEO, Steven Berglund, stated the fourth quarter and first quarter will continue to be constrained. Yet, the company is anticipating some improvement in 2016.So far, in 2015, software service revenue has contributed over 45% of the company's total revenue. Trimble expects this category to grow in a single-digit range in 2016. In regard to its business segments, the company expects strong growth in Mobile Solutions and double-digit growth in both its Transportation and Logistic segment and Construction segment. Trimble also expects operating margin to return back to 20% during 2016.Trimble listed four activities in 2016 that should yield positive traction in improving margins:The business line reduction is already underway. The initial phase should be complete by the end of 2015. Elimination of these business lines will reduce revenue by around 1% but the operating margin should improve to offset the loss. The company is keeping the agriculture, geospatial, construction, transportation and logistics, rail, utilities, forestry and field services business lines.Trimble has grown through acquisitions. The company plans to eliminate ""unnecessary"" legal entities and the corresponding costs. Trimble also plans to explore consolidation of sales, marketing and development areas.Using common platforms reduces costs. But, Trimble is becoming increasingly aware of the benefit of presenting a common ""experience"" to its customers across all of its product lines. This initiative will allow the company to reuse modules and cut the lead time on implementing improvements.The fourth initiative capturing Trimble's attention is to determine solutions using both hardware and software. The company has found, in some instances, hardware is becoming commodity-like. More value can be delivered to customers when hardware and software are bundled. The company even refers to some of its solutions as hardware-enabled software. Trimble is even embarking on the ""o"" word - outsourcing. Trimble believes outsourcing will allow it to focus on solutions while the outsourcer focuses on cost-effective and timely production.No doubt, there are reasons for hope in 2016. Trimble's share price jumped over 20% to $23+ after its third quarter report. After second quarter reporting, the company sold off dramatically dipping below $20 and proceeded to drop to its 52-week low. The bounce has maintained a $22+ level. Considering the next two quarters are still expected to be ""constrained"", the spark behind the share price bounce may flicker.As well, potential shareholders of Trimble will want to tune into highway bill updates coming out of Washington. The federal highway bill funds domestic infrastructure and transportation projects. The House recently added oil export amendments to the federal highway bill. The final version of the House bill also preserved Federal Reserve dividends paid to large commercial banks. Earlier this year, the Senate voted to reduce these dividends to help fund the highway bill. The House, instead, opted to use the Fed's rainy-day fund, its account reserved to cover potential losses. The House version of the bill requires the Fed to fund the highway bill for 10 years. Trimble's CEO, Steven Berglund, commented on the recent activity during the third quarter conference call:Interested investors will want to take advantage of the company's build into its 2016 opportunities. And, it couldn't hurt to keep an eye on Congress."
2920346,79355,2015-02-17T13:08:49-05:00,"Trimble reported earnings on February 10, 2015.TRMB is trading down 34% from its April 2014 highs, and although the company is dependent on the global economy and vulnerable to seasonality, new acquisitions may provide growth prospects.I will provide what I predicted vs. the actual outcome of Q4'14 earnings and provide some insight on what to consider when deciding whether to buy this stock.","Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) reported Q4'14 results on February 10, 2015. I have been watching this stock since its failed breakout in October 2014. Investors were once again getting ambitious into earnings. This article will cover some of the challenges that led to the last breakout failure and the future impacts of these challenges. Finally, I will present a comparison between my calculated earnings by segment and actual results.Overall ExpectationsTrimble expected revenues to be in the $560M to $590M range for Q4'14. Q3'14 revenue was $584.8M and Q4'13 revenue was $599.22M. Putting it on a graph makes it easier to visualize.A quick look at analysts' estimates vs. the company's estimates shows that expectations were high coming into Q3'14, and the actual results were even below what the company predicted. Now, analysts have aligned their standards and are falling right in line with the company's expectations. Additionally, the CEO was highly cautious during the Q3'14 conference call, and he was very conservative on the estimates. That is a good first indicator. When expectations are high, chances of a miss are greater. When there is a miss by even the company's own guidance, a larger correction may come.The Q3 miss was due to an unexpected decline in revenues in the Field Solutions segment. Specifically, there was a deeper agriculture decline due to a step-down in the global economy. For Q4, there was another decline in the Field Solutions segment, but this time it was expected. There were some unexpected outcomes in some of the other segments though due to indirect factors. I will discuss this later.A further look into the revenues by segment is in the chart below.Prior to earnings, I calculated what I thought would be the results of the earnings release and have broken them down below. As you will see, I had what I believed to be conservative estimates, and ultimately, expected a revenue beat. The outcome did not play out exactly as I expected though. There was a revenue miss, and some of the factors that led to the miss are still present. I will discuss them below.Q4'14 Engineering and Construction ExpectationsMy Q4 Conservative Estimate: $343,000,000Actual Results: $328,509,000This has been the best performing sector of the company for some time, and according to the CEO, is expected to rise gradually or level off in the coming quarters. I was a bit more optimistic than the actual performance in Q4 due to further research into some of the recent acquisitions. The expected rise can be attributed to growth within the existing products, in addition to some of the new acquisitions providing new revenue streams. Unfortunately, the optimism came too early. These acquisitions are likely to be solid revenue streams, but the impact of these investments have not shown through yet.For example, the acquisition of Manhattan Software in August 2014 adds opportunity for this segment to grow. Manhattan Software developed facilities management software, and provides asset and facilities management solutions to building owners, facilities and real estate managers. Since nearly half of the clients are in the Fortune 1000, these are stable clients with long-term prospects.Trimble has been shifting to a more vertical approach in order to target specific groups. Another example of an acquisition that should provide a healthy boost in revenue is the acquisition of Gehry Technologies in September 2014. According to the press release:Finally, major 2015 growth could be attributed to its acquisition of UK-based Amtech Group Limited. Amtech software includes solutions that assist building service engineers and contractors in the mechanical, electrical and plumbing fields. The upside of this is the fact that Trimble already has customers on the books that it will be able to market these new products to. The current access to customers will allow revenues to rise more rapidly, and a conservative estimate of potential revenue (only considering U.S. revenue) is in the $100M range, assuming $25/month per technician and 360,000 technicians.Q4 Field Solutions ExpectationsMy Conservative Estimate: $75,500,000Actual Results: $80,678,000The basis of this estimate was a sliced 15% off of revenues across the board. But if you look into this further, you will see that there are many ways to cut this. Agriculture is not the sole source of Field Solutions income, but the unknowns are high in this area so the baseline must become -15% and anything better than that will be seen as good. The goal is to consider the worst/realistic possible scenario and see if the overall outcome falls within the guidance presented. Now we know that the outcome did indeed fall within the guidance presented.In the last earnings call, the CEO stated:This was almost exclusively in relation to this segment. Moving forward, there are some things to consider now that are different from the earnings call. Specifically, the Euro is down from last year and the ECB has launched a bond-buying stimulus program. While the stimulus may help by providing more liquidity, Trimble's guidance is based off of the Euro being at the $1.26 range. As of this writing, the EUR/USD is currently at $1.1315. While this may not have any immediate effect, it can be expected that there may be an impact later in the year. The sluggish agriculture market reduced Russia's revenue by 50% and Germany's also declined. Further declines and/or added pressure on currencies are the main concerns as of now.On the positive side, the company has plans to replace lost revenue in the future through its irrigation product category. Adding this new category is an excellent idea because introducing it to its existing customers will allow it to provide a service right away with reduced marketing.Q4 Mobile Solutions ExpectationsMy Conservative Estimate: $126,000,000Actual Results: $124,140,000Q3'14 quarter's revenues were $121,171,000. The Field Services business was a drag in Q3 revenue. With the conversion of the focus from horizontal small/medium business to a vertical market focus, revenues were temporarily pinched. However, this was a strategic decision and in the long run should see a positive outcome.Although revenues were pinched, the transportation and logistics business has been growing at an accelerated rate and is the reason for Q3 year-over-year growth in this segment. I expected that there would be a slight increase in this segment due to the conflicting performances of the aforementioned items. As time passes, the Field Services business will provide a boost to the bottom line. Even with this strategic move, a look at the chart above shows a consistent growth rate, which is showing that its decisions have been made in a way that the investment is not completely crushing this segment. My estimate was based on a 4% increase in revenue and takes both of these variables into account.Actual revenues came in a bit lower than I expected. This is important because the company has given guidance that it expects 9% to 10% growth in 2015. So far, nothing presented has shown that this is a realistic possibility yet. The only way this will be possible is if there are multiple items that fall in the company's favor. I will discuss these later.Q4 Advanced Devices ExpectationsConservative Estimate: $32,600,000Actual Results: $30,503,000This segment grows at the slowest rate and has remained relatively flat for some time now. There is no expectation that it will rise at any accelerated rate in the near future. There was little information or reason to believe that there would be a significant move from the last earnings call. The CEO mentioned that there may be growth beyond 3 years, but in the near term, there is no reason to believe otherwise.Performance vs. Stock PriceA look at the chart shows optimism in the investor community since it has recently broken out from this declining wedge. This article took a look at the fundamentals of the stock again to see if this new breakout is justified. There are some things to consider when deciding whether or not it is justified. First, there was a ~2% decline in revenue due to the strengthening dollar. Moving forward, there may be added pressure, and a larger decline may occur due to this. With a 2% decline due to the EUR/USD being at $1.26, a EUR/USD at $1.1315 (where it is currently) is going to amplify this pressure. Of course, there may be offsets due to other factors, but as of now, it is not looking good for Trimble. Secondly, Trimble depends on companies that profit off of oil to obtain revenues. Oil has been rising in price over the past several weeks, and if it stabilizes, it could be said that this is a dead issue moving forward for Trimble. If not, Q1'15 earnings can be impacted by as much as 1% in this area. Third, it is important to keep up with the performance of the new acquisitions to ensure they were good investments. Finally, agriculture will have to turn around. Europe is starting to look promising due to the ECB stepping in to boost the economy, and the impact on agriculture could provide relief for Trimble.ConclusionAll of these items combined will put my estimate right in the $577M range. Surprisingly, upon completion of this analysis, I found that my numbers fell literally right in line with the analysts. The company left a lot of room on the downside to still end up in its presented range, and my estimates were highly conservative. With that said, I was a bit surprised at the revenue miss.Alternatively, a look at GAAP EPS estimates did not line up with my view. Considering the current analyst guidance was at the 0.29/share mark, I found that upon calculating the EPS off of the base revenue, gross margins, common operating expenses, and taxes that my conclusion came to ~0.23/share assuming 265M shares outstanding. This would only rise if revenue would have beaten by a substantial margin. The Q3'14 GAAP EPS was 04/share. But that was an outlier due to one-time costs such as a $52M lawsuit that the company intends on appealing. This has since been reversed.The P/E looks slightly high (31.86) if you don't look into the reason for it. The Q3'14 litigation that was reversed affected the bottom line, but the stock is trading within a realistic range if the litigation was not a factor. As of this writing, neither Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), nor Yahoo! (YHOO) has updated the financials to reflect the added EPS, which will reduce the P/E ratio. As of now, this company is a ""wait and see"" because a lot of information will materialize prior to Q1'15 earnings that will give a good indicator if a solid turnaround is possible. If you consider the items mentioned in this article, you will have a head start into Q1'15 earnings and will be able to make a sound decision when considering all potential impacts."
2790275,40101,2015-01-01T09:58:17-05:00,"In its second-quarter reporting, Trimble Navigation knew the agricultural industry would be its toughest 2014 challenge.Trimble plotted a path to address what it could regarding the agricultural market. The December acquisition of IRON Solutions, while unexpected, is a distinctly positive and healthy step.When the synergy of integrating IRON Solutions' offerings with Trimble's Connected Farm solution is achieved, Trimble should accomplish its strategy to provide productivity rather than capacity.","In late October, Trimble Navigation (NASDAQ:TRMB) reported third-quarter earnings. Trimble knew the agriculture industry would be its toughest challenge through 2014 as early as its second-quarter reporting. However, cutbacks late in the third quarter from equipment manufacturers' distribution channels detoured the navigation company. Trimble's management even called its agricultural market forecast model ""broken"" in the third-quarter conference call. Regardless, Trimble planned to continue approaching the agricultural industry as ""a provider of productivity rather than a provider of capacity"".Thus, the acquisition of IRON Solutions in December 2014 is more strategic than may be initially recognized. Acquisitions are often executed for an array of reasons - expansion of a product line or service, geographic expansion, or absorption of a competitor. In short, acquisitions are quite often a fast track to growth. Yet, often in technology companies, acquisitions are executed to acquire innovation, to acquire knowledge. Remember that Trimble was caught off guard late in the third quarter by spending cutbacks in the agricultural industry. As the company has attempted to model and forecast what to expect from agriculture, it admitted it simply misunderstood what was happening. Trimble's description, in layman's terms, is that ""the farmers have simply gone to the benches and are waiting this one out and really have cut back on their spending"". In turn, Trimble's CEO believes ""part of it is simply, they've hit the brakes hard, very hard, and I suspect they've overreacted"" (where ""they"" represents equipment manufacturers). So, it is easy to see that Trimble's vantage point on the agricultural industry was further down in the economic channel than it wanted to be. The CEO even expressed the desire to be able to ""get access to the farmer and make the pitch"". This circles back to the strategy of acquiring IRON Solutions. IRON Solutions provides market information, analytics-based intelligence and cloud-based software that improves dealer/producer productivity. IRON Solutions tracks actual equipment sales transactions. And, that is the very data point that detoured Trimble in the third quarter. Further, the integration of IRON Solutions' products with Trimble's Connected Farm solution will provide the agricultural producer with the ability to effectively manage its fleet by:Trimble Navigation's management stated it expected to return to a normal pattern in the agricultural industry in 2015, though it does expect the overall agricultural market to be down 10% to 15%. Establishing that decrease as a baseline, Trimble then charted discrete things it could do to offset that decline. The acquisition of IRON Solutions is a bonus to the steps described in the third-quarter call. It is a discrete and definitive step toward fixing Trimble's self-proclaimed ""broken"" agricultural market forecast model. But more so, the synergy expected from the integration of IRON Solutions and Trimble's Connected Farm solutions reinforces Trimble's strategy to be ""a provider of productivity rather than a provider of capacity""."

While the release still cited an impact from the U.S. agricultural industry, the information was expected and already priced into the stock (see details here). Other than that one expected hiccup, Trimble delivered an upbeat quarter exceeding management's previous guidance.In the article referenced above, three areas were highlighted as markers for Trimble's progress and success - total revenue, Field Solutions segment revenue and non-GAAP diluted net income as a percentage of total revenue. Here's how Trimble delivered:In the midst of all the good news, it's not as if Trimble purposely ignored its challenges. The second quarter press release included guarded language about the ongoing challenges in the agriculture industry. While Trimble is finding itself relying less on the revenue from that industry, it still expects significant long-term growth from it due to technology innovations. As is already evident in the engineering and construction segment, those embracing technology innovations are capturing market share.Trimble Navigation is navigating in directions worthy of notice.

2623545,40101,2014-11-01T10:46:44-04:00,"Trimble Navigation reported 2014 third quarter earnings on October 30th. The good news was limited to revenue being up 5% year-over-year.The challenges in the third quarter were unexpected... but are likely short-lived.For the long-term investor, confidence in Trimble Navigation's ability to navigate could prove profitable.","Trimble Navigation (NASDAQ:TRMB) reported third quarter earnings for 2014 on October 30th. Revenue was up 5% year-over-year and gross margins improved. However, the increases did not flow to the bottom line. Even management did not try to spin the quarter calling it ""unimpressive."" The softness in both Europe and the agricultural industries continued to cast clouds over Trimble (described here).Three areas in the article linked above were set as markers for Trimble's progress and success:On all three marks, Trimble missed:Even in the second quarter, Trimble had warned the agriculture industry would remain challenging through 2014. But, it was caught off-guard by cutbacks late in the quarter from equipment manufacturers' distribution channels and from factory fit. Cutbacks are anticipated for the fourth quarter as well. Revenue in Europe also slowed with Russia declining as much as 50% year-over-year. Unpredicted impacts also came from the acquisitions of Manhattan Software and Gehry Technologies. Manhattan develops software that plans, manages and analyzes real estate and facilities. Gehry offers collaboration software for design-build-operate projects. Trimble elected to take non-cash write-downs on pre-acquisition deferred revenue. These write-downs negatively impacted Trimble's operating income. So the quarter contained acquisition expenses but the revenue contributed from the acquired companies did not offset the level of expense. Another pertinent impact in the third quarter was an increase in the effective tax rate. Finally, the last impact relates to a $52 million reserve Trimble initiated for legal matters. Trimble plans to oppose a jury verdict award of $51 million awarded in the third quarter to an Alaskan business owner.Trimble declared its agricultural market forecast model ""broken"" in the third quarter conference call. Thus, its confidence in guiding for the last quarter of 2014 and 2015 is challenging. Rather than adopting a ""victim of the circumstances"" stance, Trimble already has plans to offset the anticipated decline in agriculture. First, its irrigation product line should start to monetize in early 2015. Second, it will proceed with new product introductions. Also, the 2014 acquisitions in the Engineering and Construction segment should start to be accretive in 2015. From a long-term perspective, Trimble plans to continue approaching the agricultural industry as a provider of productivity rather than a provider of capacity. Analysts acknowledge Trimble has been able to ""grow through challenging and cyclical environments."" So, this most recent set of circumstances will either be short-lived or it will prove Trimble is, indeed, broken. Recognizing the remainder of Trimble's business has experienced year-to-date double-digit growth, it's not naive to hope the cycle and its impact is simply a temporary trough. Considering Trimble is in the navigation industry, it should certainly be able to navigate out from under these clouds."

1127341,40101,2013-01-23T10:50:29-05:00,,"Stocks, by the dozens, are hitting their 52-week highs. Joe Terranova, in his book ""Buy High Sell Higher,"" posits the strategy that buying high means buying confidence. The strategy is based on the supposition that stocks hitting their highs are not only showing the sentiment of the market but are also showing conviction from investors. One of the first steps in analyzing such a stock is to take a hard look at the fundamentals of the company. Is the stock just hot or does the company have quality assets with solid performance data?Two stocks that have hit 52-week highs in the past 10 days are Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC) and Trimble Navigation Limited (NASDAQ:TRMB). Both companies are multinationals and leaders in their respective industry - Henry Schein in the healthcare sector and Trimble in the scientific and technical instruments sector.Henry Schein is the largest provider of healthcare products and services to medical, dental, and veterinary practitioners in 25 countries. It offers an extensive selection of dental supplies, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, equipment, and even software technology. Henry Schein strives to be a one-stop shop for its customers boasting 90,000+ SKUs in stock with an additional 19,000 SKUs in the veterinary sector. Not resting on providing quantity, quality is also a target measure. Its efficiency in delivery is reflected in its 99.9% order accuracy achievement. Henry Schein's vision is to transition from a pure distribution company to its customer's partner with the common goal of improving the quality of care.Trimble Navigation provides positioning technologies and information to allow its customers to collect, manage, and analyze position and location data for field and mobile workers to improve productivity and ensure safety. Trimble has offices in 30+ countries and sells products to over 141 countries. Positioning is more than a dot on a map; positioning allows worker identification and monitoring as well as the monitoring of asset utilization, fuel consumption, carbon emission and safety compliance. Trimble assists its customers in exploiting the value of bundling software, hardware and services.Henry Schein and Trimble are both increasing revenue year over year. Both are growing net income and earnings per share year over year. Since 2007, Henry Schein's compound annual growth rates (OTC:CAGR) for sales, net income and earnings per share (EPS) are double-digits - 11% for sales and 15% for net income and EPS. Trimble's CAGR for sales over the past five years is 12%. However, neither pay a dividend returning profit to shareholders.So, where's the cash? In the trailing twelve months, Henry Schein earned over $100 in revenue per share. But in the most recent quarter, it has only $1.01 in cash per share. Similarly, Trimble has only $1.12 in cash per share. Seriously, where IS the cash?First of all, both companies rely heavily on acquisitions for growth. Henry Schein has integrated over 50 acquisitions in the eight years since 2005, seven of those in 2012. Trimble has acquired 53 companies since 2005, 10 in 2012, as well as signed agreements for five joint ventures.In the healthcare industry, consolidation is common. Henry Schein's approach to such consolidation is to look for candidates that provide expanding products and services. Its trend has resulted in a continued focus on its core business where expansion complements existing operations and synergies develop with the acquired businesses. Growth since 2007 has been more a result of acquisition than internal growth. Henry Schein intends to continue to take advantage of the consolidation trend and to ensure it is capitalized to execute.Trimble's positioning products and technologies are used in heavy construction, engineering and construction including building information modeling (BIM), mapping and surveying, transportation logistics and agriculture industries. Trimble uses acquisitions to establish a presence in new markets, eliminate gaps in product lines, and add new technologies. Trimble has migrated from its initial business model of providing GPS ""box products"" to the present mentality of providing a portfolio of products and solutions with the goal of enhancing its customer's productivity. Trimble intends to drive growth through this type of acquisition strategy combined with a continued investment in R&D.Through the third quarter of 2012, Henry Schein had spent just over $206 million of its $1,844 million gross profit or 11% on acquisitions. Trimble had spent just over $355 million of its $790 million gross profit or 45%. Even with the abundance of acquisitions, further explanation is warranted to the question ""Where is the cash?"" for both companies.In Henry Schein's case, it has an active stock repurchase program. It originated in 2004 and has had additional authorizations five times since. As of the September 2012 quarterly reporting, Henry Schein has repurchased nearly 13 million shares for $716 million under the program, spending nearly $216 million of the $716 million in the first three quarters of 2012. The total number of shares is a net effect of the repurchases offset by unvested stock and the exercise of options. For example, in the first three quarters of 2012, 2.88 million shares were repurchased but the net decrease was only 1.66 million shares.In Trimble's case, it believes to maintain its competitive advantage, it must invest in research and development. Trimble holds over 1800 patents and focuses on not only developing new products but also enhancing existing products and promoting products for market acceptance. Products are developed or enhanced to improve performance, add features, decrease size or weight, or lower cost. Trimble's average spend on R&D compared with revenue is 12%. Through the third quarter of 2012, R&D spend is 23.5% of gross profit.While 2013 still has a level of uncertainty in regard to world economics and construction hesitancy, Trimble is positioning for growth. Trimble Navigation is forecasting five-year revenue growth at 15%-17% per year by further international expansion and market penetration. It is also expecting to grow operating margins from the current 11+% to 20+% by continuing to transition from just sensors to hardware, software and service solutions.Henry Schein points to the aging population as a major driver of healthcare spending. The industry tends to be recession resistant as well. Besides acquiring new customers, Henry Schein plans to migrate from strictly distribution to providing value-added products and services. It is also utilizing customer loyalty programs to retain and reward valuable customers.Neither Henry Schein and Trimble Navigation have much cash per share. But, both know where its cash IS going. And, both have a track record of growing revenue and a handle on how to continue. As annual reports are published in February, proponents of ""buy high, sell higher"" should consider adding Henry Schein and Trimble Navigation to their reading lists.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Shareholders of Trimble are enthusiastic, sending shares 3.5% higher during the session.The DealTrimble Navigation announced that it will acquire TMW Systems, a leading provider of enterprise software systems, for transportation and logistics companies. Combined, TMW & Trimble's software solutions span the entire transportation lifecycle. TMW currently employs 500 workers, and jointly with Trimble will serve more than 3,000 fleets across the world.Trimble will pay $335 million in cash for TMW Systems, financed through an existing credit facility.CEO David Wangler commented on the deal, ""Trimble's global presence will provide a strong channel for extending TMW's reach and scope, beyond its leading position in North America. Together, our complementary technologies can deliver exceptional returns on information that improves our customers' operational efficiencies and allows them to deliver superior customer service.""Over the past twelve months, TMW has generated revenues of $96 million. The transaction is expected to be dilutive to Trimble's fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.01 to $0.03 per share. For 2013, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to annual earnings per share by $0.12-$0.14. The deal values TMW at roughly 3.5 times annual revenues.The transaction is subject to normal closing conditions. This includes shareholder approval and anti-trust regulation.The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2012.ValuationTrimble Navigation ended the second quarter with $122 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates with almost $700 million in short and long term debt, for a net debt position of roughly $575 million.For the first six months of 2012, Trimble generated revenues of $1.02 billion. The company net earned $103 million, or $0.82 per diluted share. For the full year of 2012, the company is on track to generate revenues of $2.0 billion. Trimble could earn $200 million, or $1.60 per share.Valued at $6.2 billion, Trimble is valued at 3.1 times 2012s expected annual revenues. The company is valued at roughly 30 times annual earnings.Currently, Trimble Navigation does not pay a dividend.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Trimble Navigation have returned approximately 13%. Shares steadily rose to $55 in March and April, but fell back to lows of $40 in July. In recent week, the share price recovered to almost $50 at the moment.Over the past five years, shares returned a little over 30%. Revenues rose from $1.3 billion in 2008, to an expected $2.0 billion this year. Earnings are expected to rise from $140 million in 2008, towards $200 million in 2012. The number of shares outstanding remained largely unchanged during that time period.The acquisition of TMW Systems is a nice addition to Trimble Navigation's operations. Annual revenues are expected to rise 5%, as a result of the acquisition. Furthermore, the company can achieve significant revenue synergies as well as cost synergies. Trimble's pays a fair price, in line with its own revenue multiple, while it is significantly accretive to future earnings.Trimble Navigation's shareholders navigated shares in a Northern direction over the past two years.

They include ideas such as the Mobile Internet, 3D Printing, and Cloud technology, which will drive innovation -- especially the disruptive kind -- in the years ahead.To me, some of these ideas seem too risky to invest in: it is hard to predict who will come ahead, for example, in 3D printing. But I think many of you will agree that some of these are attractive investment ideas: if I knew who will come out ahead in ""Next-generation genomics,"" for example, I would want to put my money there -- there is a guaranteed market for whoever comes out on top.I think a company already is clearly leading the field in two of the innovative areas McKinsey listed: Automated Vehicles"" and the ""Internet of Things."" This company has nearly doubled sales and tripled EPS since 2007, has revolutionized the productivity of an entire industry crucial to the survival of the human race, and has made inroads into improving productivity in numerous other industries. And yet this company trades at 18x 2013 earnings.This company is Trimble Navigation (NASDAQ:TRMB). At $7B market cap and held by many institutional investors, Trimble is no secret. Many of you are linking to this story because you know Trimble to begin with. While the company is no longer a venture, I believe it has one of the most convincing long-term growth stories in the market, and the recent stock price weakness offers a unique opportunity to invest in a company with a ""Wide Open Road"" ahead of it.I see two main reasons to buy Trimble now:Growth Drivers: GPS drives historical productivity gainsGeo-positioning data has been around for years, but only recently has software and interface technologies improved to where GPS data has significantly improved productivity of entire industries. Did you know, for instance, that the entire United States ag industry has been revolutionized by Trimble's technology? Only several weeks ago, the US was concerned that a wet spring would delay planting until later in the year, which dangers corn as plants are exposed to the hot sun too early. In other words, there was the threat of severe corn shortage this summer, but this abruptly changed last week. A quote from a recent Financial Times article:This summer hasn't been an anomaly: precision agriculture, as technologies like GPS and autosteer which improve ag productivity are known, has been known to farmers as revolutionary:It is hard to find a negative to all of this.Trimble has been the market leader in precision ag-with a large OEM agreement with Case New Holland (Fiat International), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), and a strong aftermarket dealer presence, they have over 30% of a $2.0B market. Competitors include Raven Industries (NASDAQ:RAVN), which focuses more on sprayers, Topcon, Ag Leader, and a few other smaller players, but no one has the scale of Trimble. This is also a very profitable segment, at 38% OPM.There will be more growth ahead, as technology and software improves. The drivers are some of the hardest to run away from: increasing population growth, increased strain on water and fertilizing resources, a demand for efficient use of all farm inputs. Growth will continue. Innovations such as Monsanto's FieldScripts (NYSE:MON) offer new opportunities to use geospatial data, and will drive further penetration around the world.Trimble had a rough first quarter as farmers put off their purchases due to wet weather, but the precision ag story is convincing: many grain-focused countries, such as Brazil, Russia, China, and Eastern Europe, are only beginning to incorporate this technology. It has a long way to run.Construction: The Holy Grail of Geospatial Data ManagementTrimble's largest segment in terms of sales is Engineering and Construction, which serves the building and construction market. This segment provides devices and software used to measure distances and geospatial data during the construction of homes, roads, bridges, and other modern infrastructure. When you visit a workplace and see workman using Total Stations to measure off distances, they are using equipment from Trimble or one of their competitors.Construction is a more demanding market than agriculture in many ways: architects can come up with a variety of building plans that need to be staked out, bulldozed, and built with very demanding accuracy requirements. The process of constructing a building includes design (often on AutoCAD), surveying, and building, with constant demands on engineers to ensure they are matching the locations of the real world to those of the design world. Geospatial companies like Trimble and their main competitors -- Leica Geosystems and Topcon-add value by helping to merge the design and reality.The Holy Grail of this market is eliminating the constant measurement and surveying during construction: instead, an architect would draw up his designs, and bulldozers and workers would flatten, doze, and install according to the design using real-time geospatial data and guides. Some of this is happening already, as Trimble GPS guides Caterpillar bulldozers in roadmaking and other applications. But the industry is still perfecting the exact software-hardware mix to make construction more efficient and safe.Like agriculture, however, the effectiveness of precision technologies in improving productivity and lowering cost for construction applications is without doubt. Many California road contracts now require the use of these technologies in order to lower costs. See a federal highway report on these technologies here.Trimble has an OEM agreement with Caterpillar, and the two companies jointly promote their geospatial technologies around the world. Hexagon, the parent of Leica Geosystems, is strong in the mining market and Europe whereas Trimble is stronger in the United States and in more traditional construction markets. Both competitors have actively bought software companies to incorporate new designs, user interfaces, and uses for geospatial data into the work processes. Trimble bought a great start-up, Sketch-Up, from Google in 2011 which is used by millions of amateur designers around the world. While many users likely asked, ""Trimble who?"" after the acquisition, they likely have discovered that Trimble has left the company to run autonomously as they innovate ways to integrate it into the workflow. I think acquisitions like this give Trimble a user base and flexibility to incorporate geospatial data into various types and complexities of workflows.The margins in both of these businesses is outstanding: 37% for Field Solutions, 20% for Construction. The company has managed operating leverage very well and has gradually improved these margins.A Poor 1st Quarter, and Big DepartureFor the first time since 2009, Trimble reported earnings below expectations last quarter. The reasons were primarily two-fold:After the earnings announcement on May 1st Trimble dropped 8%. Trimble had met or exceeded expectations in the previous 12 quarters, and the 8% decline was the largest post-earnings drop for Trimble since at least 2008.There was one additional complication to this quarter: following this performance, the long-time CFO of Trimble, Rajat Bahri, announced his resignation to leave for a private equity firm. The timing and situation of this departure was suspect: he left effective immediately, is not turning over with his successor, and has still not publicly announced where he will be working next. Trimble is looking for a backup CFO but did not start this search until recently; all signs point to some sort of internal conflict causing this resignation. The CEO very curtly referred to the resignation as just that in a conference earlier this month, and there is certainly more to this story. A sign of danger to come?I don't know any details, but I suspect Trimble will be fine without Mr. Bahri and that the company will attract good talent to replace him. In the meantime, Trimble has performed poorly of late: since the earnings announcement, the stock is down 3% vs. a 3% gain for the S&P500.A Chance to get into a Real Growth StoryTrimble has underperformed, and the CFO's departure also provides some uncertainty. The ag market raises questions for the first time in years, as corn prices drop and threaten to lower overall farm investment in 2013-2014.This uncertainty is a gift-Trimble's long term story is as intact as ever. As the world population grows to 9 Billion and beyond, farmers will need to get more fruit from the land with less. Builders will need to build bridges with more accuracy and speed, and pave roads with less cost. GPS data and the ability to manage geospatial information will continue to drive productivity around the world, and that makes Trimble one of the best long-term investments you can make in 2013.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2337035,40101,2014-07-25T08:55:07-04:00,"In May, Trimble missed its first quarter guidance for EPS by one cent.
        Since first quarter reporting, the share price has fallen at least 20%.
        Analyst ""calls"" on Trimble appear to have triggered some of the price decline. Are their positions warranted?
        Trimble's recent performance and projections into 2018 reflect steady, healthy growth.","On Thursday, July 17th, a CNBC analyst recommended a viewer sell their Trimble Navigation (NASDAQ:TRMB) investment. He described Trimble as a ""Garmin without the extra bells and whistles"". It seemed like an odd statement considering Trimble's vision and goals. Granted, it could have been a cagy ploy to antagonize Trimble's management into conducting a television interview since just such an invitation immediately followed the ""sell"" call.Purely GPS?Some may view Trimble Navigation as purely a GPS play. If so, they haven't taken a look at Trimble since the mid-80's. They're short-changing themselves and the company. Actually, Trimble was never a pure GPS play. Regardless, it has evolved into so much more. First of all, an organization doesn't acquire 100 companies in 15 years without some level of transformation. Secondly, an organization doesn't invest over $1 billion in research and development in the past five years bringing its total of filed U.S. patents to over 1,000 without some level of transformation. Third, an organization with a long-term goal of increasing the adoption of technology in industries that are underserved by technology is likely to either simply fail or adapt. Lastly, an organization with compound annual growth rates of 16% in revenue and 21% in net income from 2003 to 2013 is probably not clinging to a single product as a revenue generator.No, Trimble is not a pure GPS play. Instead, it is better described as a designer, developer and integrator of hardware, software and communication systems solutions that improve work tasks and/or processes. Trimble is actually a PCMA play - Position, Connect, Model, Analyze. It claims it will tackle any challenge to deliver value to its customer.Trimble Navigation's mission is to ""transform the way the world works"". It serves five large industry segments: heavy civil construction, building construction, agriculture, geospatial and transportation & logistics. Technology adoption in these industries has been slow and is still in the early phases. Trimble estimates the opportunities in these industries are only 25% penetrated.Trimble Navigation is redefining the purpose of technology in these industries. The PCMA model migrates customers from simply using sensors to integrating technology solutions into the work process by using the collected data in modeling and analytics. Some examples of the challenges Trimble wants to help its customers address include:Trimble believes the addressable market will grow 67% in four years from approximately $15 billion to approximately $25 billion.The MarketsIn the construction industry, both heavy civil and building, Trimble projects its growth will come from deeper relationships with existing clients, geographic expansion and extending its product solutions. The market is projected to grow from $4.5 billion in 2014 to $8 billion in 2018 (numbers are approximations). While nearly 80% growth in four years may seem aggressive, it must be viewed in a perspective relative to the opportunity. The charts below detail Trimble's estimates of market opportunities in the heavy civil construction industry and the building construction industry.It could possibly be argued that the opportunities would already be met if they truly existed. This slide from Trimble's Investor Day presentation on June 4, 2014 speaks for itself:The agriculture industry, as a whole, is transforming to a manufacturing-like process. The agriculture market is projected to be around $2.5 billion in 2014 with 60% growth over four years to around $4 billion in 2018. Trimble's approach is to help the industry identify which factors are controllable and which are uncontrollable. By understanding the controllable, productivity can be maximized. As well, understanding the uncontrollable helps growers minimize the impact. The chart below displays the opportunity in large machine guidance, just one factor of the agriculture industry.At its June Investor Day, Trimble offered case studies validating ROI in the same three of the five primary industries it serves. In the heavy civil industry, two identical road designs were built. Using technology, the road was built in half the time with 43% fuel savings and twice the accuracy over conventional methods. In the building construction industry, Trimble measured the construction of its own office building in Colorado against industry metrics. There were reductions in site prep and erection time. Costs were reduced in field engineering and rework costs were cut. In the agriculture industry, Trimble produced recurring returns on investment as a result of implementations such as large machine guidance, irrigation solutions, fleet management, and adopting imagery. In only 5 examples, Trimble documented savings of a recurring $1.6 million per year for its agriculture clients.The VisionTrimble Navigation's CEO, Mr. Steve Berglund, summed up the company's vision in layman's term in the first quarter 2014 earnings conference call:He stressed the entire organization has adopted:Regarding the state of the three industries, heavy civil construction, business construction and agriculture, Mr. Berglund shared:There certainly appears to be much more upside in Trimble's story even if one were to limit it to the five traditional industries it has served. When considering Trimble is expanding its offerings to other industries such as the rail, environmental & waste, water utilities, electrical utilities, mining, forestry, field services and oil, gas & chemical industries, the opportunities seem boundless. Likewise, considering the opportunities in emerging markets such as China, India, Latin America and Africa are primarily unmet, the potential for Trimble's growth seems quite reliable. With all of that on the horizon, why has Trimble's share price nosedived in the past 90 days? Why is a CNBC analyst recommending it is time to go?Trimble's PositionOne should remember Trimble is teaming with industries that have a reputation of being extremely slow to change. Yet, even with that impediment, Trimble more than doubled revenue from $1.13 billion in 2009 to $2.29 billion in 2013. In the same time frame, net income more than tripled from $63.96 million to $218.17 million. Trimble management is just now beginning to see a change in approach by its customers and potential customers:Coupled with the factor of ""slow to change"" is the migration of Trimble's own business model:Because of slow adoption and changing offerings, any glitch along the way runs the risk of being over-magnified.The glitch reported in May for 2014's first quarter was the impact weather had on the agriculture industry in the United States. Drought conditions occurred in the west while extremely wet conditions kept farmers from planting in the east. Every other Trimble business segment saw high single-digit to double-digit growth. Overall, revenue was up 9% year-over-year while net income was up 38%. It didn't help that this was the second year in a row that weather impacted Trimble's agricultural segment. It probably encouraged analysts to linger on the associated risks. Mr. Berglund lamented the circumstance:Off Course?In early May, Trimble's share price spanned the $38 - $39 range. After the first quarter earnings report, Trimble's stock price lost nearly 9%. When an analyst downgrade from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" and price target adjustment from $40 to $36 on July 2nd reiterated the agricultural impact, the price fell another 6%. It has since slipped into the low $30 range for a cumulative loss of at least 20%. Is this glitch being overworked?In general, there is a growing need for food. Mr. Berglund stated in the conference call that he still believes ""the agricultural market can support double-digit growth over the long term"". He explained:He did not minimize the risks though:Looking BackThe chart below displays the volatility in the Field Solutions segment of Trimble's business where the agricultural market impact is felt. It's important to understand that the geographic information system (NYSE:GIS) sales are also reported in this segment and that they can be just as volatile.When viewed in terms of its contribution to revenue, it is hard to imagine that the Field Solutions segment could trigger such a change in share price. The pie chart reflects the contributions to revenue of each of Trimble's four segments.However, when viewed in terms of its contribution to operating income, the Field Solutions segment is clearly a more critical component. The slices of the pie chart shift dramatically when operating income by segment is input.Because its operating margin averages 38.3%, the Field Solutions segment accounts for just over 33% of Trimble's operating income.There are global corporate costs that are covered by all of the segment operating incomes. Acquisition costs, amortization for purchased intangible assets, general corporate expenses, amortization for inventory step-up and restructuring costs are examples of such corporate costs. For the full year in 2013, these costs accounted for 51% of segment incomes. After these adjustments, operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 11%. The chart below displays Trimble's performance in increasing its operating income percentage for the past four years and most current quarter.Net income as a percentage of total revenue and non-GAAP net income as a percentage of total revenue for the same time frame are displayed in the charts below. While the degree of improvement is not as positive as the changes in operating income, there is still a positive trend line.There is little question the agricultural market is carrying the blame for the slips in Trimble's first quarter earnings miss and the share price tumble. However, it does not appear that everything is being considered in context. Minus the Field Solutions segment, the other three segments increased revenue by over 14%. Trimble failed to deliver on the low end of its first quarter revenue guidance of $610 million to $630 million by just over $5 million. With its non-GAAP EPS guidance at $0.40 to $0.43, it missed the low end by $0.01. Trimble management did admit to guiding cautiously for the second quarter.It guided total revenue would be $605 million to $630 million and non-GAAP EPS would be $0.38 to $0.42.And Looking ForwardDeciding to sell or lowering recommendations and price targets was likely based on future expectations rather than past performance. After all, a one-cent miss on EPS (three cents based on analysts' estimates) hardly warrants a 20% share price decline and/or a 10% one-year price target decrease. But, for a reference point, a quick look at Trimble's recent history should help set the stage for the look toward 2018. The chart below shows both the diluted EPS and the non-GAAP diluted EPS as well as the ratio between the two. For 2014 and 2015, current analyst estimates for non-GAAP EPS are used. The ratio for 2014 and beyond is an average of the ratios of the past four years and 2014 first quarter. The non-GAAP EPS projections for 2016 through 2018 were derived by using Trimble's data and extrapolating it into the future as shown in the charts below. As mentioned above, Trimble projects its addressable market as $15 billion in 2014 and growing to $25 billion in 2018. The chart below maps that progression using a compound annual growth rate of 13.6%.By using the CAGR of 13.6%, an addressable market for 2013 was estimated to be $12.96 billion. Trimble's share of that market, based on its 2013 annual revenue, was 17.66%. Using that market share equates to revenue projections for 2016 through 2018. Analyst estimates are used for 2014 and 2015 in the chart below. The non-GAAP EPS for 2016 through 2018 shown in the chart above was then calculated using a historical growth rate for share count and a historical average for the non-GAAP net income to total revenue ratio. These estimates are all displayed in the chart below. Note the amounts are displayed in differing amounts to aid in the chart's readability. Also, the EPS line is tied to the secondary Y axis to better display the correlation to revenue and net income growth.Using analysts' estimates doesn't necessarily raise any flags on Trimble's recent share price, even considering the drastic drop. Using 2014 estimates, the current P/E tops 19. Using 2015 estimates, the forward P/E tops 16. It could be reasoned Trimble's share price had run ahead of itself as that is a common question in the market of late.The factors used to extrapolate into 2018, especially those based on historical performance, may be exactly the factors which can change the trajectory for Trimble, even justify another share price run. Knowing Trimble's targets for these factors also helps validate or invalidate the projections.Beginning with Trimble's market share of the addressable market, the above calculations use 17.66% as Trimble's rate. As a reminder, this percentage was determined by using a reverse calculation to determine 2013's addressable market and Trimble's 2013 annual revenue. Dividing the 2014 estimated annual revenue from analysts evenly across the quarters results in a $622.5 million rate per quarter. But breaking down the trajectory into evenly growing quarters equates to needing revenue of $591.6 million in the 2014 first quarter. On the positive side, Trimble's 2014 first quarter performance paced ahead of the market share ratio at 18% and the revenue rate at $604.7 million. It is pertinent, here, to understand that Trimble's quarterly performance does not, historically, flow evenly. For the past four years, the second quarter has topped the first (in all four), the third has slipped below the second (in three of the four), and the fourth has topped the third (in all four). The chart below displays the historical flow for the past four years using the first quarter each year as a base. It is interesting to note there's only been one quarter in twelve that slipped below the first quarter bases. The table below the chart plots several paths to the 2014 year-end.All three paths shown in the table above fit easily into Trimble's guidance for the second quarter of $605 million to $630 million. The key to watch in the second quarter report is not whether Trimble hits its guidance but rather where it hits. Hitting low puts excess pressure on Trimble's second half performance and would require breaking out of historical quarterly performance trends. Hitting high may very well signal the agricultural glitch was indeed just a glitch.Executing the same set of exercises for non-GAAP EPS results in the chart and table below. One option shown displays the results of trusting Trimble's intent to expand non-GAAP operating margin by 2% to 3% by leveraging operating expenses. In the first quarter of 2014, the non-GAAP operating margin for three of Trimble's segments, (excluding Field Solutions), grew by almost 40% year-to-year. Even with the inclusion of the Field Solutions segment, the first quarter operating income increased to 21.2% of revenue as compared to 19.8% of revenue in the same quarter of 2013. As a reminder, Trimble's guidance for second quarter's non-GAAP EPS was $0.38 to $0.42. Should EPS register on the low end of guidance in the second quarter, it would not be surprising to see the stock price take another tumble. But, if it hits on the high end or exceeds, it should not only stabilize the price but may trigger a round of positively resetting full-year expectations.Position, Connect, Model & AnalyzeTrimble Navigation is scheduled to report second quarter earnings on August 5, 2014. A quick checklist of metrics related specifically to the second quarter which would help grant integrity to Trimble's projections into 2018 follows:The verbal ""sell"" recommendation on Trimble Navigation seems a harsh overreaction or an uneducated view of the company's plans and track record. The downgrade from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" isn't as alarming when looking at this particular point in the agricultural industry's cycle and management's guardedness, both short-term factors. It could basically be interpreted as a ""hold"" recommendation. The recent leveling of the share price seems to offer a fair-value buy-in opportunity if an investor is interested in Trimble's longer-term growth story. The recent price range is not a bargain nor is it a reach.Trimble may be an expert in global positioning but it has chosen to position itself as a technology provider. Analysts ignoring this position aren't connected to what's happening. The models and analytics are falling into position for projecting through 2018. For investors desiring steady and healthy growth performance, Trimble Navigation is worth their due diligence, their attention on August 5th and may even be worth establishing a position.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

        The company's earnings call discussed expected challenges, unexpected impacts, future revenue streams and a hard-line shake-up.
        As Trimble repositions for execution, the measures and the time frame defining ""improvement"" are clear.","Investors in Trimble Navigation (NASDAQ:TRMB) probably still cringe when it's time to talk about the Field Solutions segment. Trimble is an integrator of global positioning solutions - a PCMA (Position, Connect, Model, Analyze) company. Since the first quarter of 2014, when the agricultural industry was projected to begin a strong growth trend, Trimble and its shareholders have, instead, watched as the Field Solutions segment's revenue declined and declined again. Surely, the company cannot control weather and weather has been a key factor. On the other hand, the company's forecast model for the segment was broken and it fixed that. The company moved forward introducing product lines in the segment. After all, it's not as if the management team is void of accomplishment.Viewing the company as a whole, Trimble doubled revenue in five years between 2009 and 2013. In the same time frame, net income tripled. If one would have excluded the Field Solutions segment in 2014, revenue growth was 9%. But the Field Solutions segment is a significant contributor to net income and its poor performance resulted in a 7.6% decrease in full-year non-GAAP EPS. The challenges were expected to continue into 2015:So, it really wasn't a surprise when Field Solutions revenue was down 17% year-over-year in the 2015 first quarter. What was a surprise to Trimble's management and shareholders was the ripple effect of lower crude prices:And, as if weather had not caused Trimble Navigation enough headache in its Field Solutions segment, the Engineering and Construction segment was ""severely impacted by weather"" in the northeastern states. The end result was a year-over-year decline in first quarter revenue of $22 million or 3.7%. Net income, on the other hand, declined 50%. Non-GAAP EPS was down 28.2%.The quarter did have positive news regarding future revenue streams - winning the Beijing airport project, a multi-year alliance with Paccar (NASDAQ:PCAR) and teaming with Microsoft to develop tools for the Windows 10 holographic platform. But, even with progress on the horizon, Trimble startled shareholders with news of an internal shake-up.The intent is to:The basic design of the new organization is outlined:The second point in the citation above regarding the transition from a hardware to a software solutions provider is operative. Trimble is far more than a GPS device play. As highlighted in previous reports, its recurring revenue stream is growing at a faster pace than overall revenue. Recurring revenue is derived from SaaS (software as a service) and subscription fees and maintenance support agreements. The gross margins on these types of revenue are also superior to the gross margin on product. The strategy to align the organization around this driver is sensible.Trimble management had already attempted to focus the market's expectations on the second half of 2015. The challenges outlined in late 2014 do still remain for the near-term. It could be argued the organizational realignment creates an air of ""time-out"". Whether it be external or internal, management changes at the executive level usually imply time is needed to see results. And hints did exist in the first quarter earnings call:Yet, Mr. Berglund, Trimble's CEO, also explained the changes are meant to have immediate impact - a ""hard-knock short-term accountability"". He agreed the company could easily blame the past few quarters' performance on external factors - weather, agricultural industry downturn, lower crude oil prices, a strong dollar. But, he also acknowledged:So, as Trimble Navigation repositions itself in the present, the purpose is clear - ""execute whatever the conditions"". The stage for the rest of 2015 is ""sober and possibly conservative"". But, the measures, as the year progresses, are clear:And the time frame is clear:Even though Trimble's recent share price is closer to its 52-week low than its 52-week high, the current P/E ratio is approximately 20, hardly a bargain. But, as the management shake-up and business opportunities prove profitable, Trimble should rebound noticeably - both at the EPS level and then, subsequently, the share price. That is, if and when a repositioned Trimble executes."

106277,21636,2008-11-17T03:47:00-05:00,,"In my last blog post about convicted felon turned fraud fighter Barry Minkow’s expose of corporate officers and directors misrepresenting their resumes, I closed with the following comment, “As a convicted felon, I have learned that where there is smoke there is usually fire.” In this blog post, I take a closer look at Trimble Navigation Limited (NASDAQ: TRMB).According to a Fraud Discovery Institute (Minkow’s private investigation company) background check, Executive Vice President and Executive Committee member Dennis L. Workman claimed in various SEC filings (latest 10-K here) that he obtained a Master of Science Degree in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1969. However, a background check by FDI shows that while Dennis Workman attended MIT from September 19, 1967 to May 31, 1968, no degree was conferred.The Wall Street Journal contacted MIT and reported that:The Wall Street Journal article goes on to say that:If Dennis Workman did not obtain a degree from MIT, he violated company policy in addition to causing a false report to be filed with the SEC.According to Trimble's Business Ethics and Conduct Policy:Trimble's Business Ethics and Conduct Policy goes on to state that:The company should terminate Dennis Workman's employment if he cannot provide evidence of a Master of Science Degree from MIT and refute Minkow's report, if it really espouses ""the highest ethical standards and exercise proper judgment in all business dealings"" and ""is committed to providing full, fair, accurate, and timely disclosure"" to the SEC.Barry Minkow and I believe that if you lie about your educational background, you are capable of lying about anything else, too. Investors require honesty from the fiduciaries running their companies. If an outsider like Minkow can find false credentials in corporate America where company gatekeepers have failed, what other problems exist that investors are not aware of? Do the officers and directors running these companies put their fiduciary duties to their shareholders first, or are they more concerned about their own personal self-interest?A starting point for answering the above questions can be found by examining Trimble’s $250 million share repurchase program announced by the company in January 2008.Often, investors are pleased when companies buyback their stock, since they consider it a sign of company confidence in the value if its shares. However, legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) CEO Warren Buffett, was once said:Therefore, if we follow Buffett’s advice, investors should be suspicious of management’s true intentions in buying back company stock. Is the intent of such stock repurchases to build “intrinsic value” or is it used to “pump or support the stock price?” One way to find out the true purpose behind stock repurchase programs is to look at insider selling, especially as the company is buying back its stock at the same time. Insider selling while a company buys back its shares may indicate that such a stock repurchase program is nothing but a ruse to allow insiders to sell at temporarily higher stock prices caused by company stock buybacks.As I detailed above, early this year, Trimble Navigation announced a $250 million share repurchase program. During the first nine months of this year, the company repurchased 3.707 million shares on the open market at an average price of $31.23 per share. The total purchase price of such shares was $115.85 million.During the same nine months ended September 26, 2008, Trimble reported net income of $127.73 million and had operating cash flow of $141.95 million. Therefore, stock buybacks were about 91% of net income and 82% of operating cash flow.Meanwhile, insiders have been unloading stock at large profits. During the same period, insiders sold 93,349 shares at an average price per share of $35.68 and pocketed gross proceeds of $3.331 million.Based on the above, we should ask: Did Trimble’s stock buybacks help to prop up the company’s short term stock price, so insiders could unload their shares at higher profits than if there were no stock repurchases at all?Is this a company that puts its shareholders' interests first?Written by:Sam E.

163835,20422,2009-09-29T03:55:44-04:00,,"Trimble Navigation (NASDAQ:TRMB) provides advanced positioning product solutions to commercial and government customers worldwide. The company uses global positioning systems (GPS) and robotic optical surveying instruments that incorporate GPS, optical, laser, radio, or cellular communication technologies for various applications including engineering and construction, agriculture and mobile workers who can employ advanced technologies to improve efficiencies and provide advanced uses of collected data. Engineering and construction is the largest customer segment, which is hurting sales.With a Return on Capital Employed of 35% and an Earnings Yield of 3.2% Trimble is no longer a value investing opportunity. However, they offer a quality balance sheet and a free cash flow yield of 5.3% and free cash flow margin of 19%. The company’s trailing P/E ratio is 34, though the Enterprise Value to Free Cash Flow ratio of 17 demonstrates the strength of their underlying business. Once there is a rebound in the engineering and construction industry, Trimble should see their revenues turn around.For the quarter ending July 3, 2009 revenues were down 23% to $290.1 million from $377.8 million in the second quarter of 2008. Operating margin fell to 9.9% for the quarter down from 16.7% as the company was unable to keep expenses in line with declining revenues.Key Drivers and BarriersDriversThe drivers of Trimble's business are: 1.      The growing need to reduce costs of businesses that use equipment to navigate during their operation.2.      The new applications of navigation technology used in all types of business.3.      Demand for data that can be collected during the operation of a machine while performing other tasks.BarriersThe important barriers Trimble has created to protect its market position are:1.      The proprietary technology embedded in their products.2.      The company hold approximately 791 U.S. issued and enforceable patents and approximately 119 non-U.S. patents.RisksThe current slowdown and recession in the United States is negatively hurting sales of Trimble's products, especially in the engineering and construction sector. The new spending by the government on infrastructure projects has the potential to increase activity in the engineering and construction industry. The company is highly dependent on the rebound of the engineering and construction sector..As a small company they depend on specialized technologies that depend on Global Positioning Satellites and laser guidance. Should there be any substantive change in this technology, Trimble could face significant losses.GuidanceFor the third quarter of 2009 Trimble expects revenue in the range of $275 million plus or minus five percent. At a point estimate of $275 million in revenue, Trimble expects third quarter 2009 GAAP earnings per share of $0.13 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.25. Non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of 2009 excludes the amortization of intangibles of $13.3 million related to previous acquisitions, the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $4.5 million and $1.3 million in anticipated restructuring charges. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share assume a 28 percent tax rate and 122.5 million shares outstanding. Other ConsiderationsNo stock repurchases were executed in the first quarter 2009.The Bottom LineBased on the fundamentals of Trimble and its dependence on the engineering and construction industry, it makes sense to be sure the engineering and construction industry is poised to rebound. Then look to buy on dips in the price."
48603,21047,2007-10-01T08:20:01-04:00,,"Trimble Navigation Ltd. (NASDAQ:TRMB) is a leading innovator and provider of advanced location-based solutions, typically to commercial and government users. It integrates and provides its expertise in Global Positioning Systems [GPS] and data collection systems, enabling the management of large amounts of geo-referenced information.

The Advanced Devices segment has an agreement with u-Nav Microelectronics to license Trimble GPS technology for u-Nav GPS chipsets. It also has a co-operative licensing deal with Nokia for Trimble's GNSS patents related to designated wireless products and services involving location technologies, such as GPS and assisted GPS.Trimble's global operations include development, manufacturing and logistics operations in Sweden, Germany, New Zealand, France, Canada, the Netherlands, India and the United States. With over 700 patents in its portfolio, this company has the broadest positioning solutions portfolio in the industry.Key pointsThe competitive nature of the four business segments under which Trimble operates is not very congested, suggesting that there is plenty of room for continued market penetration and subsequent growth. One part of the overall company's effective strategy is to target each business segment and make acquisitions in order to respond to changing market conditions. Tremblin's latest acquisition was Germany's Ingenieurburo Breining which according to the company will improve its ability to customize survey for the German markets.Tremblin is part of the wireless equipment commercial enterprise, which has proven to be an excellent industry over the past five to ten years. The industry itself has experienced significant expansion year after year prompted, among other influences, by the commercial sector which is constantly looking for new ways to become more efficient and apply this efficiency in their business.With continued advances in technology further enabling commercial deployments of wireless networks, great business opportunities continue to emerge in the GPS space. Global positioning systems and related products have become quite prevalent. Many businesses are adopting this type of technology and merging it with their current infrastructures, thus improving their efficiency and in the process create better customer service. Consequently, companies with leading positions such as Tremblin, with more sophisticated systems and superior products, are benefiting revenue/wise and dominating the markets allowing a higher level of efficiency and performance among users. GPS units are selling at a high rate with companies realizing significant profits to their balance sheets.ConclusionBased on these facts and more importantly on that of the global positioning systems being the technology that will continue to push businesses into higher productivity, companies involved in this segment of the wireless equipment industry, especially those in the leading positions such as Trimble Navigation Ltd., with its worldwide presence and unique capabilities, position the company for higher growth in emerging markets allowing it to significantly gain from the momentum and the future growth prospects that the industry is currently experiencing.Tremblin' s market cap stands at $4.71 billion. Profit margins 10.44%. Operating margins 15.23%. Revenues $1.08 billion for a gross profit of $462 million and a $113 million in net income. Its return on equity came in at almost 14% with a current ratio of 2.12. Quarterly earnings growth yoy posted at almost 23%.On July 31st, the company issued its third-quarter guidance saying it expects third-quarter revenue to grow 25 percent to 27 percent, in the range of $294 million and $299 million and that it sees third-quarter earnings per share between 18 cents and 20 cents. This year's earnings estimates have increased to $1.20 per share. Next year's estimates have risen to $1.45 per share.One detail also worth mentioning: in the last five quarters the company posted four double-digit earnings surprises. Increased retention of business and increased production are the primary causes for the increase in revenues.In short, growth continues to remain part of Tremblin's picture.Technically,the stock's five year chart speaks volume. On its yearly chart, the ticker just staged a nice breakout of a one-month base. The old resistance level has become the new support line.TRMB should continue uptrending from its current levels with mid - short term price target of $49.Disclosure: Author has a long position in TRMB"

44451,20521,2007-08-14T09:31:15-04:00,,"On Sunday, October 23, 2004 disaster struck the residents of Niigata Prefecture, a scenic spot in Honshū, the largest island of Japan. Starting shortly before 6 in the evening a series of 15 earthquakes for the next 66 hours rendered more than a million people homeless, and their houses became heaps of rubble.
Even as search and rescue teams swung into action to bring relief to the affected, a different work started on war footing with Paul Yoshitomi of the Disaster Prevention Research Institute at the helm.
Paul and his team fanned out quickly to assess the damage caused by the quake, armed with Trimble® Recon® rugged handheld computers combined with small, lightweight Trimble GPS receivers.
Over the next 5 days, using Trimble’s GPS and GIS technology Paul’s team would untiringly prepare maps, reports and detailed analysis of the damage at Niigata Prefecture, as well as generate fast and accurate damage certificates for residents and business owners.
Mission critical success at Japan’s Niigata Prefecture is but one more feather in Trimble’s cap, a leading positioning technology company. Though GPS technology is its mainstay, Trimble (NASDAQ: TRMB) combines a wide range of positioning technologies including GPS, laser, optical, and inertial technologies with application software, wireless communications, and services to provide complete commercial solutions.
Founded in 1978, TRMB’s formidable portfolio includes over 700 patents and serves as the basis for the broadest positioning offerings in the industry. Over the years it has chosen the path of acquisition to grow. It now has excess of 500 products spread over 4 core market segments – Engineering and Construction, Agriculture, the Mobile and Field Workforce, and Advanced Devices.
Of the 4, TRMB’s Mobile Solutions Division commenced in April 2001 to offer Internet location-based services for the mobile workplace as well as address the emerging market for location-enabled mobile devices.
Its Feb 2007 the acquisition of @Road, Inc. of California, while reinforcing its growth strategy in the Mobile Solutions Division, positions TRMB as a market leader in providing Mobile Resource Management [MRM] solutions.
TRMB’s Jun ’07 quarterly revenue stood at $327.7 million, up 34 percent from that of Q2-2006. Net income improved from $28.5 million to $35 million (+ 23%).
Among the major business segments, the Mobile Solutions’ Q2-07 revenue of $40.9 million showed sizzling Y-o-Y growth of 176% ($14.9 million in Q2-06). The operating income of this segment too has improved to 7.1% of revenue (2.5%).
From the figures it would seem the @Road acquisition is doing good to TRMB’s mobile solutions division. If this is so, TRMB can be expected to do better for the full year for this sector. The recent uptrend in the stock price is perhaps an early indication of that.
GPS and related place and location technologies are experiencing a growth surge at the moment, and what I like about Trimble’s portfolio is its application-specific product line that offers custom solutions for problems in Construction, Agriculture, Mining, Field Support, etc. based on their core location technologies. While the generic consumer mapping and local search / placesmart search segment is searing hot, it is also extremely competitive.
Trimble’s business application focus, I feel, is both compelling and sports high entry barrier, at the same time, carving a nice niche that is outside of the immediate focus of players like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Yahoo (YHOO). I like this somewhat off-center strategy, as it enables them to build a differentiated channel and customer base with less competition."

If it's not in your car or on your phone, it'll be in your pocket soon enough. The Global Positioning System [GPS] era has arrived, and Trimble Navigation (NASDAQ:TRMB) is one of the leaders reaping this long-awaited harvest. Trimble was a pioneer in commercializing GPS, and over the past few years its leadership position has finally paid off in terms of big profits and a tremendous stock performance. The stock is up 40% since we wrote about it in January, and TRMB is up more than five-fold over the past four years.  TRMB 1-yr Performance Chart  GPS is a satellite-based system that relies on precise measurement of the time it takes for radio signals to travel between satellites and receivers. Atomic clocks can measure the travel time to the billionth of a second and, by triangulating the distance with at least three satellites, GPS products are able to determine their position to within a few feet in a typical consumer application such as car navigation. In commercial applications such as construction equipment the accuracy can be inside a centimeter. GPS is increasingly recognized for applications such as in-vehicle navigation systems and handheld GPS units for hikers and campers. Parents can even equip their children with tiny receivers to track their whereabouts at any time. While Trimble has a good foothold in these consumer end-markets, much of its business comes from commercial, agricultural, communication, and industrial applications. The roads you drive, the food you eat, and the cellular network infrastructure all have a significant thread of GPS in their creation or operation. Trimble is one of the pioneers in the fragmented GPS industry, and while it is considered a leader the company has hit a few rough spots along the way. New management implemented some strategic redirection and cost-cutting to get Trimble back on a profitable course in 1999 after losing money in two of the previous three years. The company outsourced production and sold its manufacturing assets, improving its balance sheet and turning fixed costs into variable ones. Trimble is focusing on areas like control and guidance of construction machinery, precision agriculture, and mobile fleet management as well as the components business. Most of Trimble's $892 million in annual revenue comes from either custom solutions that integrate GPS technology with other systems [agriculture, construction, heavy equipment] or off-the-shelf GPS products such as vehicle navigation systems. But the company's patent portfolio may lead to significant licensing revenues as the GPS era unfolds. GPS has been heralded for years as a technology that will revolutionize many consumer and industrial markets, but uptake was slow to occur until recently. Now a confluence of factors suggest the time is right for GPS to become pervasive. For starters, the size and cost of GPS products have fallen dramatically. Another sign that GPS is taking off is the variety of end markets where demand is quickly building. Applications for GPS include navigation systems for cars, boats and planes, fleet tracking, agriculture, and construction. Another promising application of GPS technology is the precision timing for data networks. Precise synchronization of computers, servers and Internet applications is central to the deployment of networking technologies like packet switching. The company introduced its first product for this market in 2004--not the best time to jump into the networking field--but it is a potentially huge opportunity for the future. This market is intertwined with wireless infrastructure, and last year Trimble introduced a mini GPS timing module that is about the size of a postage stamp which uses precision timing and synchronization to control the flow of data on a network and maximize bandwidth use. Sales slowed in 2002 due to the recession, but just slightly. Trimble bounced back impressively and the company has posted solid growth in recent years. Sales increased 11% in 2005 to $745 million and earnings increased 43% to $1.43/share. This year the company is expected to deliver 41% growth in EPS to $2.02, and analysts are forecasting a 5-year growth rate of 15% for earnings. For investors, the appeal of the blossoming GPS market is hard to ignore. This is a highly profitable company with attractive long-term growth qualities as the GPS market comes of age and if Trimble can expand its leading market share. If it can live up to its potential and deliver a steady corporate performance, aggressive growth-oriented investors will continue to flock to stocks like Trimble.

A savvy investor friend of mine once said to me ""If my wife knows the company then I don't invest in it"" meaning he likes companies that are not closely watched or followed by the main stream. All of us have heard of GPS (Global positioning system); related companies that come to mind are Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) and Magellan (a division of the french conglomerate Thales) that sell GPS devices and car navigation systems. A name not so often heard is Sunnyvale, California based Trimble Navigation Limited (TRMB). Trimble provides advanced positioning product solutions. The applications served include surveying, agriculture, machine guidance, asset and fleet management and telecom infrastructure. Trimble products often combine location with a wireless link to provide specific solutions to specific applications. The company also develops software algorithms and embedded firmware that can process the location information for further value added functionality. The company has five key segments it operates in: Trimble seems richly valued with current ratios of : What then makes Trimble Navigation a growth story? Two key factors that we believe make this a growth story are as follows: Strong macroeconomic demand for construction and mining equipment worldwide partly due to the commodity boom and construction activity in China and other emerging markets bodes well for the company, Trimble has strategic alliances with two of the biggest players Caterpillar (CAT) and CNH Global (NYSE:CNH). Trimble software makes GPS available on Sprint-Nextel (NYSE:S) phones today. The software business is a high margin segment and should do well as location based services start becoming a staple of mobile and web usage using Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, EVDO or GPRS / W-CDMA technologies.  While we don't think this is a super high growth story, the company should deliver growth and returns outperforming the market. The company derives a lot of its revenues from construction and mining and this is a highly cyclical industry, but as said above the current long term trend is favorable. In the short term Q2 is traditionally a strong quarter. So we should expect to see good growth this quarter. The company has a strong balance sheet about $75M in cash, and it carries a small debt load of $0.65 M. A key indicator of business Cash flow from operations increased to $93M in 2005 from $74M in 2004 and $30M in 2003. Overall we believe Trimble Navigation is moving in the right direction, although we would like to see the company get more agressive in the defense and military applications. TRMB 1-yr Chart"
